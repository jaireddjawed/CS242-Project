He’s been distancing himself from his friends because he’s been depressed but he’s never gone this long without talking to me. The last conversation we had was him snapping on me and me saying “Wow okay. That hurt my feelings lol.” basically and he never responded so I texted him again saying “How much would it have inconvenienced you to just say sorry or at least pretend that you care about hurting my feelings?” and he still hasn’t responded. I feel desperate. I don’t want our friendship to end like this but I look so thirsty constantly texting him. I can’t stop thinking about him. I partly just want to say i’m sorry just so we can talk again but he’s the one who made me cry lol. Was I in the wrong for the second message? It had already been 2 days between messages.",

        "text": " I have been dating my SO for 3 years and we are struggling with money. SO makes 120k a year and I make 40k.\n\nSO has about 20k in debt (maybe? Not entirely sure), and I have about 10k. Besides that we pay around 2000 in rent, $700 car payment (bad credit and got put in a bad position). SO has a child and pays for private schooling which I assume is over 1k a month. The kids other parent doesn't financially contribute at all. They watch the child a lot, but doesn't contribute financially at all.\n\nEach month we are stressed about making ends meet and paying bills. I am under the assumption that with a combined gross 180k of income, we should NOT be stressed to pay our monthly bills. I have had numerous talks about getting our financial situation in better control but the conversation always turns into an argument because my SO believes it is all aimed at them. I'm not attempting to aim the the blame at my SO, but they make 3x the amount of me and I am contributing as much as I can to the relationship.\n\nI have recommended that maybe their child doesnt go to private school because we cannot afford that, but there is a lot of pushback. Other than that, I have absolutely no clue how we are scraping for cash every single month.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to have the conversation about money, in the manner of \"hey if we don't figure out whats going on, this isn't gonna end well\", but without turning it into an argument. I get that there needs to be help from both sides, and I am trying my best, but it's hard to tell someone making 3x more than you that maybe they aren't doing money right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease any tips or recommendations to resolve this dispute as I find it very important for the future of the relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: We make 180k a year gross and still are paycheck to paycheck. We are stressed every month trying to pay bills, and I do not know how. The money conversation always leads to arguments as I'm accused of blaming it on my SO, but she makes significantly more than me.",

        "text": "Long story short, I met an amazing girl 2 months ago. We fell for each other pretty quick; it was her idea to become bf/gf, her telling me she'd never leave, asking me not to either, her telling me it was the best sex and connection she's ever had with anyone, that I made her feel more special than anyone ever has, and eventually telling me first that she loves me.\n\nTwo days after she L bombed me, she broke up with me saying she was basically having anxiety about how to make it work given she has kids, and lives an hour away. She was also in the middle of a big move, and a career change. That she never knew how to fully function on her own given she had kids early and had always been in relationships. Totally understandable I thought.\n\nWe talked and flirted for another 2 weeks or so until one night she went totally cold and she blew up at me the next morning about how she just wasnt ready and if we kept talking and hung out again she was going to start feeling codependent like she always had and just wanted to be alone. She texted me all that night telling me how she knows we couldve made it work if she was in the right state of mind and was ready for a relationship to be in her life. She said she'll miss me, regret leaving forever, and told me how much she loved me. She blocked my number after that talk so she wasnt \"tempted to give in and text or see me\".\n\nI just want to write her one letter I thought up to get off my chest because a week after this and having not talked to her since that day, I just want to let her know if she ever feels ready at some point in the future, to find me. We had a genuine connection I felt, tons of stuff in common, and she left saying she'd never forget me, wanted it to work, and loves me a lot. Like it couldve been something great if we met at a different time. And that's just want I want to let her know.. when she's ready for that time, to try and reach out and not be scared.\n\nSince my number is blocked though Im not sure how to send it to her. Its kind of eating me alive. Even if she doesnt answer, I feel like it opens the door for me atleast and gives me some kind of closure. Ill have said everything I needed to say and can finally start moving on for myself. I wanted to leave a handwritten note on her car at work but I dont know if people consider that creepy or not lol. Or if even trying to write to her again would be considered creepy.. I just know if I dont try she'll always be the one that got away for me.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nTl;dr: met the girl of my dreams but at the wrong time and circumstances, want to let her know that when she's ready.. to find me",

He had good savings from his previous job, and although we haven’t spoken specifics about our financial situations, I know he can last at least a few more months on it. I have seen a big change in him(positively) since we met and he admits he is ready to go back to work now, but he just isn’t in any rush to find anything. \n\nMaybe it’s just me over thinking it, I grew up reasonably poor and although his family isn’t ‘rich’ he definitely didn’t struggle growing up and had pretty much anything he needed, So that probably just gives us a different mindset. His savings are totally down to him, he worked hard and got a good job. He doesn’t just sit around all day, he still finds ways of using his time like going for runs/meeting friends. He doesn’t rely on me at all, still pays for dates and things equally. \n\nI just don’t know how long to give it before it gets worrying. I don’t want to pressure him, because it’s his choice, but we have spoken about taking things further and it just concerns me that he isn’t worried at all.\n\nTldr Bf is out of work for 6 months for mental health, he’s better but isn’t in any rush to get a job.

So we're both pretty strict on cheating and believe cheating is whatever the person inteprets it to [be.](https://be.So) So a year into our relationship she saw my history on my computer and saw that i watched porn. She got really upset that I watched stuff like that while being with her.\n\nI felt really bad and told her how sorry I was. She accepted my apology and we were having a great time, until 6 months later. When I was in my hometown away from her, I watched porn again out of curisoity and was also super horny. When I got back to our apartment she saw my computer still had the porn tab open as one of them and she saw it.\n\nAnyways my girlfriend got really upset and left. She told me not to contact her. I apoligized but she said it didnt mean anything because you did it again. I feel really bad at hurting her and not knowing better. Im kicking myself everyday for the actions I did.\n\nShe said lets take a break for a week, saying that she wont contact anyone outside of our relationship, it was just for us to take a break and reflect if I want truly her and only her. I do, Ive never loved someone so much in my life and me being immature in relationships since this was my first one has led me to destroy the thing I love. I know its my fault, and I dont deserve any sympathy.\n\nBut I wanted to see if anyone else was in a similar situation and how they apolgiized twice for the same mistake. If anyone had advice on what to say or if its too cheesy to get her a gift or make something for her, it would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to rip on me too.\n\nBtw she's done absolutely nothing but love and respect me the entire relationship, so it feels like extra betrayal to her.\n\nTldr; Did same mistake that gf almost considers cheating, how can I make it up to her?",

        "text": "My (30f) boyfriend (31m) and I have been together for two years. We both had a very Catholic upbringing, and we have been working through things in the bedroom to overcome some subconscious repression and hesitancy over sex. \n\nIn a nutshell, as part of this we considered exploring bringing another woman into our bed. I had confided this to a very good friend of mine (“Steph”) and she confessed that she and her fiancé had been considering the same thing. \n\nLong story short, we made a “deal.”  We would be each other’s third in a one-time threesome arrangement. Our significant others wholeheartedly agreed with the plan, and my boyfriend and I went first. Steph joined us at our place, of course with the consent of all involved including her fiancé. It was a great night - after we got over some initial nervousness it was a hot and surprisingly intense time. No awkwardness after, all seemed well. We planned that I would join Steph and her fiancé three weeks later (this coming Wednesday). \n\nThat’s where the issues began. My boyfriend had started to indicate feelings of jealousy the closer we got to the date where I would join them. He said he was surprised at the level of intensity of our night and was having trouble wrapping his arms around me joining them as well. He said he hasn’t been able to get the visuals out of his head and his anxiety over it was starting to overwhelm him and keep him up at night. Finally on Friday he told me that if we went through with this, he was fearful that it would have long term damage to our relationship and he might not be able to get past it. \n\nI mentioned this to Steph in general terms on Saturday by phone. She was quiet but seemed somewhat understanding. However, she texted and called later to say that she was beyond disappointed, and was upset at what seemed like us backing out of our deal. She said our night together was great, but she (and certainly her fiancé) would never have agreed to it if it wasn’t part of an arrangement. She said she was starting to feel used and wondered if this was my boyfriend’s plan all along (I don’t think it was). \n\nSo, I feel stuck! I feel like I am going to really let down one of these really important people in my life. To be clear, I am totally game for joining the two of them as planned, but I want to respect my boyfriend’s wishes too. And I’m a little freaked out by the fact that Steph’s agreement to join us was justifiably tied to the expectation that we would reciprocate, and now we are potentially changing the game on her. \n\nHow should I think about this? What would you do? \n\nTl;dr: I made a threesome deal with a friend but my boyfriend is having second thoughts.",

If talking about my interests, she only gives one word replies and will look at her phone after just a few minutes of me talking. I've told her that is rude, she agreed to try not to look at her phone, but not seeing much improvement. I suspect she might have Aspergers and depression - how would others handle this, or would it be a dealbreaker?\n\nMy (30/m) girlfriend (27/f) is a very introverted and shy person which is not any issue for me as I am also quite introverted. However, she has a tendency to talk about her own things for a long time, but when I start talking about something that interests me, she will not really engage in conversation, or will even look at her phone. I talked to her about this, she accepted that is antisocial and agreed she will try to work on it, which I was happy to hear.\n\nThis morning though, she was in a down mood and barely communicated at all. I was looking forward to showing her a project I was working on and asked if she'd like to see it. She nodded, so I started telling her about it. While I'm telling her, she started looking at Tiktok. After I finished, she didn't say a single word about the project, like whether it looks good or anything. She basically just got up and left, and didn't say another word to me for the entire morning. She was stressed about work and I know that and I support her about it, but it really hurt me that while I will patiently listen to her complain about work for hours, the moment I wanted to show her the project I am enthusiastic about, she looks at Tiktok while I'm talking about it.\n\nI suspect that she might have high-functioning Aspergers and maybe mild depression, because my dad has both and can be similar in behaviour. She gets easily overwhelmed by life circumstances.\n\nOther than these issues, the relationship is quite good - we have a lot of shared interests, values, and enjoy exploring things together. We do have a lot of good conversations and can flirt and banter together, but most of our conversations are about something related to her or her interests. I understand she can't be interested in all my things, but she doesn't have to look at Tiktok while I'm talking, right?\n\nJust wondering how others would approach this, or whether it would be dealbreaker for them.",

        "text": "I’ve known my girlfriend for a couple of years just as friends, and then last year she told me that she had feelings for me and wanted to try dating. Before we got together she had never been with a man before and thought that she was a lesbian, so when she told me that she was interested in dating me, I told her upfront that I was wary because I was concerned that her being attracted to me was just a fluke and that I didn’t want to be an experiment for her to then realize that she did actually prefer women and break up with me. She assured me that this wasn’t the case and that she knows herself and her sexuality and has realized that she’s bisexual. So I agreed to go out with her, but we’ve been taking it slow. We’ve been together for about 5 months now.\n\nOver the last month or so she was acting a little bit off so I looked through her phone (I don’t feel bad about this because my suspicions were correct) and I learned that she has in fact been hooking up again with a former female partner of hers, in her texts she’s been saying that she wasn’t expecting to miss being with a woman so much and that now she isn’t as sure as she thought about being attracted to men. From what I can tell it seems like she’s trying to go back and forth between us to compare and see whether she thinks she’s actually bisexual or if she’s a lesbian and forcing her attraction to me for the safe of our relationship.\n\nSo to be completely honest I’m not very upset because I did sort of expect this to happen and that’s the reason I haven’t been 100% invested in our relationship either. I’m a little hurt that she’s been going behind my back, but I do also understand why she didn’t feel like this is something she could come talk to me about because I’m sure it’s hard for her to basically be wrong about knowing herself as well as she said she did. But now I’m not sure if I should just tell her that I know what’s been going on so that it’s out in the open, or if I should just pretend I didn’t see anything in her phone and just allow her the space to figure out what she’s interested in. She said in one of the texts that she knows she needs to make a decision so I figure she’ll eventually end things with one of us.\n\nWhat do you think I should do? I can’t ask any friends for advice since everyone I know is friends with both of us and I’m not trying to blow up her spot.\n\ntl;dr: My girlfriend is cheating on my with a woman while trying to decide if she’s bisexual or not and I’m currently pretending not to know about it, but should I tell her I do?",

        "text": "Hi reddit, im in a bad predicament with my girlfriend of 2 years. So we're both pretty strict on cheating and believe cheating is whatever the person inteprets it to be. So a year into a relationship I was following all these models on IG that I liked from Tiktok. To be clear once we were in a relationship I didnt interact with them at all, I barely use instagram so I just didnt unfollow them. When my girlfriend saw I liked one of the pictures (was mindlessely liking), she freaked out and told me that she felt betrayed that im looking at other woman and finding them attractive in that way.\n\nI felt really bad and told her how sorry I was. She accepted my apology and we were having a great time, until 6 months later. I was on tiktok one day and there was this girl that I went to instagram to see her content which was funny videos and also pics of herself. I closed my phone, and then when I went to show my gf something, it was right there when I unlocked the phone.\n\nAnyways my girlfriend got really upset and left. She told me not to contact her. I apoligized but she said it didnt mean anything because you did it again. I feel really bad at hurting her and not knowing better. Im kicking myself everyday for the actions I did.\n\nShe said lets take a break for a week, saying that she wont contact anyone outside of our relationship, it was just for us to take a break and reflect if I want truly her and only her. I do, Ive never loved someone so much in my life and me being immature in relationships since this was my first one has led me to destroy the thing I love. I know its my fault, and I dont deserve any sympathy.\n\nBut I wanted to see if anyone else was in a similar situation and how they apolgiized twice for the same mistake. If anyone had advice on what to say or if its too cheesy to get her a gift or make something for her, it would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to rip on me too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw she's done absolutely nothing but love and respect me the entire relationship, so it feels like extra betrayal to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr; Did same mistake that gf almost considers cheating, how can I make it up to her?",

        "text": "My husband let's his emotions take hold of him often. Sometimes he takes something I said or did wrong and I immediately apologize and explain my intentions and tell him I love him and would never intentionally try to hurt him or be cold to him. But he won't let it go. I told him today how it makes me feel. That I feel like he just wants to hold onto it and be upset at me and it feels disrespectful. \n\nHe admitted that he feels like when he's the one upset and I'm apologizing that he's winning. I feel like he treats me like it's him against me. Not us against the problem. \n\nHe will get mad and keep repeating how he feels and what I did wrong even when I'm crying my eyes out to him and apologizing. He just looks at me so hateful and I feel like an annoyance. I sometimes feel like he wants me to feel bad just because of how he THOUGHT I meant something. I feel like it could be resolved easily once I explain the mishap.\n\nI've found myself getting worked up to having panic attacks during these blowups. I feel emotionally overwhelmed and I feel like he beats it into me where I fucked up and it gets to me. He doesn't hit me or anything but he says little hurtful things that dig at me and they've all built up to me feeling shitty in general. BUT after I reach the point of panicking he will start treating me kind and hold me and try to calm me down. Why not treat me kind when I'm simply crying? all he does before I have a panic attack is look at me while I'm sobbing and explaining that I would never mean to hurt him.\n\nHere's what happened yesterday:\n\nWe were in a store and he thought the salesman was bullshitting us and said a few curse words to the man. He was calm but rude and I was quietly like \"hey\" to make him realize what he was saying and then he got on the phone with a lady about a product we were buying and thought she got an attitude so he got one and I was like \"babe!\" quietly again.\n\nWe got in the car and I was still emotionally down. not upset or anything. Just not feeling good anymore. Just not in a happy affectionate mood and he said he was upset that he kept trying to be affectionate to me and I wasn't reciprocating. But I was just feeling bad that the whole vibe wasn't as happy as earlier. It just put me in a reclusive mood. \n\nHe said I was acting like he was in the wrong. I told him no I don't think that. Maybe the salesman was bullshitting us. Maybe the lady did get an attitude. But you control your own happiness and how you treat others. People are just shitty sometimes but just go on and enjoy your life.\n\nI've noticed he gets angry with strangers quickly. He doesn't just yell or anything, but he does get snippy really quickly. \n\n I used to bounce back emotionally and just go back to normal but lately it's been harder to do. I feel like I'm burning out emotionally.\n\nI told him i felt this way and he didn't deny it was abuse. He just said he's sorry I felt like that. I'm not asking if I should stay or who's right. I just want to know if it sounds like verbal/emotional abuse. Feel free to give those opinions too if you have them, though.\n\nI want a fair opinion because if I'm wrong I can handle that and apologize.\n\nEDIT: He always apologizes and treats me with respect when it's been a little while and he's level headed again. It's just like he can't see how damaging he's being in the moment.\n\nTL;DR- Husband gets upset a lot, I have panic attacks over our altercations, I'm emotionally burning out. Is this a form of abuse? Why is he like this over things?",

We also had mutual gaming friends so it was easy to get along. We seemed to hit it off from the start and all was well. Up until recently, where I developed feelings for him and ended up telling him the truth.\n\nHe apparently felt the same way so we became a little more than friends. He lived in Wisconsin and I lived in Illinois. We’ve gotten close to point where we just knew so much of each other, even the exact address of where we reside.\n\nAn event came up in Wisconsin; a vintage fest. I was interested in going but also mentioned to him that I’d be up there and possibly meet him. Seemed like he was on board with it and came the eve of the event, he told me he would meet me finally at the hotel I’d be staying at. 2 hours before that were to happen, he tells me family matters came up and wouldn’t be able to meet. He knew I was to be up there over the weekend (2 days). He proceeds to tell me that he didn’t think it would be a good idea to try a romantic attempt, seeing as he hurt me and didn’t want to do that anymore and wanted to remain as friends. “A platonic relationship”. He said, “whatever you decide, I will respect that decision. My doors will always be open.”\n\nI never responded as I was unable to feel correctly of the situation. I was very hurt as I thought this person cared about me enough. I deleted all communication. Facebook, snapchat, discord, etc. Told our mutual friends what happened. They were very angry. They banned him from our servers.\n\nShould I have done something differently? Should I have talked to him? Would it be ok to reach out to him again now? Its been 10 days.",

She called her and was crying on the phone telling her to \"Take her son back\" and how \"He never helps out with the kids anymore, he just locks himself in his room to play music\" and how the other day apparently they were at the store with their 2 kids (2 sons.....One is almost 3 and one is almost 1) and how something happened and he started yelling \"F THIS, F THAT, I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE\" causing a scene in front of everybody at the store.\n\nThis is completely unlike my brother in law. I didn't even know they fought period until this phone call. Every time we see them together they are the sweetest to each other, holding hands, kissing, BIL is helping with the kids, ect.....\n\nMy MIL said after this conversation on the phone, Rachel texted her and said she is sorry she called and it was in the heat of the moment and blew everything out of proportion and her husband is just stressed and forget she even called.\n\nThis is why my MIL called my husband, to ask if she really should ignore it or if she needs to call her other son about it.\n\nMy husband said to just ignore it because \"People fight\". I say that this was a cry for help and it can't be ignored now because now MIL is involved now and knows (well, now we all know).\n\nWhat is the true thing that should be done here? Get involved or let it go?\n\nTLDR; Don't know whether to get involved or not after finding out that BIL is fighting with his wife out of nowhere.",

        "text": "I 24M have started a relationship with my GF 20F for about 2 months now, we met when I begin working on a cinema for a couple of months after graduating from college as a safeguard, there I met my current GF, we were just acquaintances for a long time until se begun to work full time there and was transferred to the same area as me, from that moment on we begun to grow closer and closer with each other and went out on a date.\n\nShe had pointed out several times that her parents were really overprotective, so the dates usually lasted 3-4 hours top as we would see each other from 1 to 5 pm maximum as she had to arrive home before 6 or her parents will be mad. We would go to eat and try to see other place to visit, but we never have any privacy because of that.\n\nBut the last couple of weeks some problems arise, like the parents have been fighting between them making that she had to be home before 5pm as her father didn’t went to pick up her mother from work so he arrived earlier. Also, her mother wouldn’t let her go out sometimes. GF haven’t told her parents about our relationship because she is scared that they will tell her she is too young to be in a romantic relationship and that we should break up, but I think she has to tell them for us to be able to see each other without them being so cautious.\n\nOn top of that I managed to get a better job on a college with regular schedule and weekdays of work so I accepted, but because of that our schedule is way worse as in the cinema the work hours and days to work change every week.\n\nWe haven’t been able to go out on dates, and we had an opportunity the past Saturday so I invited her, GF on Friday morning said that she was determined to tell them about us after she finished working, a couple of hours later she said she was scared as she kept thinking that the cons of telling them where greater than the pros but that she still was going to tell them, then she went radio silence until late night when I send her a message to check on her, about an hour later GF said she wasn’t able to go out, I asked what happened and she replied that asked to go out and her mother got upset, GF got scared and didn’t mentioned about our relationship. I said it was fine and that better not touch the matter for the time being. She said she was depressed and went to sleep.\n\nThe day after GF messaged me asking if we were fine and I said yes, she kept asking me if I was not mad, I said no for the first two times. I thought that was the end but she insisted if I was not mad, then I kinda lost my cool and told her I was not mad but I was kinda disappointed and was growing fed up on trying to invite her on a date. GF went and said I was being unfair with her and I wasn’t able to relate to her situation because I can go out without needing the approval of my parents.\n\nI replied that I wasn’t blaming her or mad at her, that I in fact had a similar experience with my parents when I was younger so I did understand her, but the part I was getting fed was that GF wasn’t asking this with time so it was harder that they would let her. GF replied that she really wanted to make this work and part of her knew she has to tell them, but also, she knows the giant lecture her mother will give her, told her to break up and be mad about it.\n\nI really love her but this situation is really taking a toll on me, it’s frustrating and really unusual\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : Her overprotective parents are making really hard to date her, What should i do?",

Every time I come home from my stressful job, he makes sure there’s food on the table. He takes my car and get gas at night so I wouldn’t have to in the morning. The list goes on. We haven’t been intimate in a while and I’ve been feeling that we have been disconnected. I never had to worry about him with other girls because I know that he only likes me and only likes to hang with me. I’ve seen his phone before and he trolls the girls who reach out to him on his dms. Yesterday, I checked his phone because I just had the biggest hunch then boom. He commented on a girl’s selfie 4x on different days saying “Why are you so perfect”, “You’re so cute”, etc. He said it meant nothing and he’s just been lonely and had no one to talk to. Idk what to do tbh. It sounds like it’s a small thing but it’s a huge issue to me especially I’ve been cheated on multiple times.

My mom and grandparents are coming out to visit in April, or were going to anyways. \nMy place is small, so my grandparents were going to book an Airbnb. They found one two minutes away from my place. I thought everything was good, but then my grandma texted me saying she cancelled the Airbnb because she wasn’t impressed with the neighborhood. This hurt my feelings because it is my neighborhood. It’s nice here, it’s a middle class neighborhood and looks like any other part of San Diego.\nIf this was the only comment she made, I could forgive her. But I have a toxic relationship with mh family. I was always the black sheep. My grandparents went to all my cousins sports games when we were younger but never went to any of mine. They took my sister out shopping and for lunches and dinners and I was only taken out to eat a handful of times. I always had been forgotten in mh family and I am still hurt by this. I am in therapy for this, by the way.\nMy mom agrees that what she said was hurtful, but that I should let it go and have them come out to see me because they are getting old. My thought is that I’m still hurt and April is a month away. Am I overreacting?\n\nTLDR; my grandma said my neighborhood isn’t where she wants to say and I am hurt by this and want to cancel their upcoming trip",

        "text": "\n\nTLDR: a year ago, I texted another girl, and since then, trust has gotten worse.\n\nTrigger: self-harm \n\nLet me start at the beginning. 2 years ago, my ex walked out on me without warning to pursue a relationship with a guy she met online. We had been married for 17 years and had two kids together.  I took it hard. I attempted to unalive myself the first time shortly after. My family intervened and got me help. A few months passed, and I tried it again when I received the divorce paperwork. \n\nI reached out to family and friends. My family took care of me again and one friend.  Enter my angel. She talked to me late into the night and all day. She had been through 3 divorces and knew very well what I was going thru. After months of talking, we realized that we were falling in love. We started dating slowly at first. When my divorce was finalized, I lost everything. She took my kids and me in. \n\nA few months later, things got more challenging for me.  I was trying to get a new position within my company. When my boss found out, he had me demoted with a trumped-up disciplinary hearing. The offer letter for the new job was rescinded. I was making a fraction of what I had and significantly less than I would have with the new job. My angel again stepped up to me.  She covered the loss of income and helped me rewrite my resume. \n\nThis was when the problems began. I was struggling hard with depression and anxiety. Communication suffered. Intimacy suffered.  It felt like I had lost everything. My career of nearly 20 years is gone. We struggled through it. I even proposed. But there were still problems. She was worried that I would find some hot young female to talk to and would leave her for them. (this isn't far fetched as before her, I tended to have friendships that included inappropriate communication)  \n\nAfter eight months of looking for a new job (career), I finally found one. It paid almost exactly what I was making before.  I thought she would be excited for me, but her anxiety worsened.  She was convinced that I would find someone else at the new job.  She kept mentioning the \"attractive young female.\"  On the first day of the new job, my boss created a group chat using my cell number and including a co-worker. (Something I'm still a bit upset about as I don't give out my cell number) he volunteered me to water her plants while she was out with covid.   \n\n Having never met this person, I assumed they were a \"little old lady,\" as most people in that department were. I was happy to tell my fiance about watering the little old ladies' plants. When she returned, however, I found out that was not the case. She was, in fact, young and overly friendly.  This is my first mistake.  I didn't correct my misconception her to my fiance. I assumed it would be better for her to remain the \"little old lady.\" \n\nA few months went by. Communication with my fiance was still a challenge. Intimacy was still a problem. Anxiety on both our parts was still a problem. Then communication nearly fell apart completely. She wouldn't take calls during the day, barely responded to texts, and when I would get home, we barely talked. \n\nThe \"little old lady\" continued to be overly friendly. This was the breaking point. My boss went on vacation, leaving me in charge. A problem came up that I did not know how to handle, but the  \"little old lady\" did. She helped me, and I let my guard down. She asked me to friend her on Facebook. Like an idiot, I did.\n\nA few days after, my fiance told me that she would end her life if I ever stepped out on her.\n\nA few weeks later, I was out for drinks with my fiance after a long hard week. For some reason I can't explain, I sent a picture of my glass to the \"little old lady.\" The next day she responded. I was at a gardening center with my fiance and told the \"little old lady\" as much. She asked me to look for a tree for her yard and sent a picture of her house. That's when my fiance noticed.  We got into a huge fight. She accused me of cheating and admitted that she had seen my Facebook and knew she wasn't a \"little old lady.\"\n\nThis was my lowest point ever. I realized that I was not a good person. I had betrayed my fiance's trust. I was hurting her worse than you could imagine. I hated myself and wanted to unalive myself. I hurt myself with a knife and was ready to finish it, but I had a sudden fear. What was my fiance doing? Was she about to do the same thing I was?  I needed to check on her before I did it.  I found her in a cemetery. She hadn't hurt herself. For some reason, she asked me to get in the car with her. I did, and we drove to a liquor store, then home.  \n\nI proceeded to get very drunk. I was still injured from my attempt. I don't know who called my sister (it could have been me), but she came and picked me up, took me to her house, bandaged me up, and put me to bed.\n\nThe next day I faced the music. I made a vow never to allow anything like this ever to happen again. To be open and honest in everything I do.  To that end, I purged my Facebook friends. Leaving only family, I blocked the \"little old lady\" and never spoke to her again; I swore off drinking. I haven't had a drop of alcohol for a year. I created a Google meet link that I would join as soon as I got to work so my fiance could see and hear me anytime she wanted.  A month later, I accepted Christianity and even got baptized.  I have been faithful to my vow. I refuse to give her another reason to be upset with me.\n\nThings seemed to be getting better for about six months. Communication, intimacy, and even anxiety seemed to be getting better. Then six months ago, things started getting worse. Occasionally she would ask if I was staying with her or if I was talking to someone else. About once a month, she would blow up at me. It gradually got worse. She started making excuses as to why she wouldn't join me in Meet. Saying things like, \"I don't want to bug you.\"  She never bugged me.  She started having self-esteem issues and seeing attractive females as her competition. She became obsessed with losing weight.  \n\nLast night she blew up the worst I've ever seen. She yelled and screamed. She told me she couldn't do this anymore and didn't want to be together anymore. We stayed up all night talking. I feel slightly better seeing that she put on her ring this morning and still says, \"I love you,\" but I'm terrified.\n\nWe are set to be married in a few months. We just sent out the invitations. The chapel has been booked.\n\nI admit all wrong. What I did was evil, and there is no excuse. \n\nWhat I'm hoping for is some advice.  I'm hoping someone out there knows of a way for me to show her that I'm honest. That my vow is for life. That I refuse ever to be that guy again. \n\nI want to help her get her self-esteem back.  I love her with every fiber of my being. And will fight for her with my last breath.\n\nThank you for any advice you can give.",

        "text": "Good or bad boyfriend?\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. The first eighth months of our relationship was a nightmare because he treated me like shit. But we both worked on our relationship and ever since then, he’s been really good to me. Every time I come home from my stressful job, he makes sure there’s food on the table. He takes my car and get gas at night so I wouldn’t have to in the morning. The list goes on. We haven’t been intimate in a while and I’ve been feeling that we have been disconnected. I never had to worry about him with other girls because I know that he only likes me and only likes to hang with me. I’ve seen his phone before and he trolls the girls who reach out to him on his dms. Yesterday, I checked his phone because I just had the biggest hunch then boom. He commented on a girl’s selfie 4x on different days saying “Why are you so perfect”, “You’re so cute”, etc. He said it meant nothing and he’s just been lonely and had no one to talk to. Idk what to do tbh. It sounds like it’s a small thing but it’s a huge issue to me especially I’ve been cheated on multiple times. Dont know what to do\n\nTL;DR: Good boyfriend relied on someone’s story saying “why are you so perfect” because he was lonely. Should I still be with him?",

        "text": "\nThis past Saturday night, my husband and I went out for drinks with a friend before we had a late dinner at a restaurant we’ve been wanting to go to. My husband had 6 or 7 drinks before dinner and 3 wines at dinner, for context. He proceeded to talk way too loudly and act belligerently at this very fancy restaurant. I was sober and a bit embarrassed, which he must have sensed because he then got defensive and started to verbally lash out at me for “judging him”. The remainder of the dinner was extremely awkward and I tried to change the course by asking him if he was excited about his trip to NYC the following weekend to see his brother for match day which really set him off.\n\n\nSome background- this NYC trip is a bit touchy. I have had some weirdness with his brother lately, as at our wedding last year he was telling people my husband and I didn’t get him and his wife a gift on their wedding, which was not true. Once my friend told me he was telling people this- AT OUR WEDDING- I followed up and sent him the receipt from the cash gift I sent via his wedding website. He said he received it and even sent a thank you card. I had let this slide, maybe he was confused, but then I sent him, his wife and new baby a very thoughtful and expensive Christmas gift and they never reached out to say thank you. His brother has always been very self absorbed and is in medical school and just had a baby, so I understand he likely has a lot going on. But he rarely (if ever) reaches out to check in on us, and when he does, he dominates the conversation with what is going on in his life. I don’t even think his brother knows anything about us. So after I did not receive even a simple thank you text (which is all I would have wanted!) for the Christmas gift, I decided to take a bit of a step back from making an effort to check in with his brother, though still being cordial and polite. My husband has the same sentiments and sees the relationship as one sided, but loves his brother and doesn’t let these things bother him.\n\n\nHis bro is matching for his residency this week and my husband’s mother wanted the whole family to fly out to NYC for the event. It is a 4.5 hour expensive flight, not to mention having to take off work and then pay for a hotel, so I asked my husband if it were ok if I potentially stayed back with our dogs since I just started a new job and the trip is very expensive. I did communicate my frustrations i had been having, so he knew this was an underlying reason. I also said I would go if it was really important to him. He said he would be disappointed bc he would want to show me New York, but he would wholeheartedly understand my reasons. \n\n\nMy husband has a tendency to not be direct or communicate his feelings, instead relying on subtle hints that I admittedly miss most of the time. I am very direct with my feelings and have asked for this type of communication style when there is something big going on with us. My husband has trouble with this and consequently let’s things fester and builds resentment towards me which comes out in drunken explosions every 5-6 months or so. He will be blackout and lash out very aggressively by calling me names and overall having a very combative demeanor with me. He has never gotten violent, though one time he started filling up bowls of water and throwing them at me. \n\n\nThese occasions tend to blindside me, because as I mentioned I am bad at picking up his passive hints about what’s bothering him and to me, we had discussed NYC and I thought it was resolved. My husband admitted that he often says one thing and feels another as he considers this a “sacrifice” for the relationship. This is another reason he builds resentment towards me. \n\n\nFast forward to the dinner this past weekend. We were celebrating my birthday and once he sensed I was “judging” him, he had a very bad attitude the whole dinner, ignoring me, belittling me and being very rude. I was mortified because he did this at a fancy place and people could hear and were staring, which made him more angry and belligerent. \n\n\nWhen we got back he was worse and could see me crying which lead him to gaslight me that the dinner didn’t happen that way and I was being ridiculous and petty. \n\n\nWe have been talking about how problematic this behavior is since it has happened and he does feel remorse and admitted he was resentful because i was not going on the New York trip. Usually the next morning after these outbursts he remains mad at me and tries to tell me it didn’t happen, so this is definitely progress bc I am not going to allow this to happen to me again. \n\n\nI called some marriage therapists this morning and my husband agreed he needs help but I am at a loss on how to deal with this until our appointment. I feel raw and broken. How do I navigate this until we can get help? \n\n\nTL;DR- Husband doesn’t communicate directly and let’s things fester. Gets blackout drunk and lashes out verbally.",

        "text": "I (F22) haven’t spoken to my friends in almost a month. They didn’t reach out besides one of them sending me a reel on instagram once, and I won’t make the first step to them at all. One month ago, it was my birthday. I haven’t celebrated my birthday party in 5 years (first because of covid, then I wasn’t confident enough to do something with my friends, so I just did it with my family). This year I’ve felt a lot better, I got into a wonderful relationship, made some new friends in college and felt good enough to finally celebrate my birthday. My friends I assume got used to me not doing anything for my birthday, cuz they were taken a bit by surprise when I told them “hey, make sure that weekend you’re available, I want us to go out for my birthday”. My closest friend said he will come right away, I didn’t get a clear response from the other two. Basically, one of them told me that she had to leave the town, but she made it eventually, the second one told me that she can’t make it because she has TO STUDY FOR AN EXAM. You cannot take 2 damn hours of your time to tell me happy birthday and drink some juice, I was fuming at that point. When my birthday came, my other two friends didn’t exchange more than a “happy birthday” with me, only talked between themselves, and left after two hours because “they wanted to go eat somewhere” (they knew from the start we weren’t going to eat there). The people I called my best friends acted like my birthday was something they just had to tick off the list and couldn’t escape it any faster. Even other people noticed they were acting weird and it was disappointing. I felt worthless. What am I doing so wrong as a friend to not be celebrated a bit? I haven’t missed ONE of their birthday, I was always happy for them, I was present…They never gifted me anything on my previous birthdays simply because I didn’t plan an actual event, while I even when to a whole fucking different country for one of them, and planned stuff and I am so disappointed yet so hurt that it was so hard for them to even maintain a damn conversation with me and the rest of the people invited. After they left, they haven’t talked to me for the rest of the day. I am done, I am tired of feeling like I don’t fit in, that maybe I am the one that didn’t listen enough or that I like to spend time with my boyfriend, which is a big inconvenience for them apparently. I was a damn door mat for trying to reach out for them for MONTHS to get them to hang out (because I didn’t want to be one of those people that gets into a relationship and forgets about their friends), with barely any response, only for them to hang out without me (they go out only to smoke sometimes, so they don’t invite me since I don’t smoke). I really, really tried. I am not perfect, but fuck, I am done. With these people I’ve been friends for 7+ years, 20 years with my closest friend. They know me and I know them the best, it feels so weird and lonely to not talk with them anymore, not plan things…maybe I am a bit dramatic, but I really needed to vent. Having my boyfriend is absolutely amazing, and he is my best friend after all, but I still feel like a part of me that is very old and familiar is missing. But I will move one, learn to be a better friend and find better friends.\n\nTL;DR: I ghosted my closest friends of 7+ years because they don’t give a crap about me, one of them missed my birthday, the others barely talked to me. I am now basically friendless, but it’s better this way.",

        "text": "Things have been pretty bad in our relationship for the last year. I won’t get too much into it, however we used to live together and things were perfect.. then he decided to move to a different city (by himself without talking to me about it first) and things completely changed. We’ve been off and on for the past few months— breaking up for a few days then back talking. It’s honestly pretty toxic and exhausting. \n\nThings have been good for the past two weeks.. however I brought up wanting to hang out with him and his friends and told him I wanted him to post me on social media— just a story or something, as he’s constantly posting his friends including other girls. He used to invite me out all the time with them and would post me, but that completely stopped and now all we do is hang out at his apartment. I fear he’s cheating on me because why else would this change? Why else would he not want everyone to know we’re together? He told me he likes to go out with his friends because that’s how they bond and likes to stay in with me because it’s relaxing and that’s how he likes to spend his time with me. This was never a huge issue for me until I found out he was messaging a few “friends” that were girls that I had yet to meet. \n\nThis has been a topic that I’ve brought up MULTIPLE time throughout the last year. He continues to gaslight me, saying he wants to keep his private life private and that couples who post each other are “cringey” And I should just trust him. \n\nI need advice— I’ve tried telling him multiple times how this makes me feel (I feel hidden and like a secret) and he says that he will invite me out or post me and never does. How do I tell him that I feel like there’s an alternative motive to him not wanting to post me/bring me around his friends without coming off accusatory or hurtful? Would setting a boundary like “I want to be invited out with you guys once a month and posted once every two months” be a good boundary or is that childish? \n\nI’m exhausted. I used to be really confident and less anxious in this relationship but he has given me many reasons to feel uneasy. This is my last effort to save this relationship. \n\nTl;Dr— I feel like my boyfriend is cheating because he stopped posting me and bringing me around his friends.",

        "text": "My boyfriend (28) and I (22) have been together since August 2022. Before this we had been casually dating (but exclusive) for a year and a half and then broke up for a year and ultimately decided to get back together. When we broke up it was because he never fully committed and was talking to other girls behind my back. He quickly had another girl lined up after we broke up who he casually dated until we got back together. I went no contact and he begged to talk to me that entire year that we were broken up. He explained that he was scared to be in a committed relationship before because his last serious relationship left him heartbroken and that was why he was never fully locked in. Since we’ve been back together he has been a loyal, sweet, and loving boyfriend. I want to make it clear that our relationship is nothing like it was before. \nIm making this post because this weekend we got into an argument and his behavior scared me. I’ve been in a physically abusive relationship before but I don’t know if what happened this weekend would be considered physical abuse or abuse at all. \nWhen we woke up on Sunday morning he told me that he was going to Vegas this summer for a bachelor party. I told him that I didn’t like that he was going because he broke my trust before. Before we had broken up in August 2021 he had gone to another Vegas bachelor party and followed girls that he had met and I’m sure did plenty of other shady things that he shouldn’t have been doing while in an exclusive relationship. When I told him how I felt about him going he immediately got defensive and hostile. He jumped out of bed and said I’m driving you home right now. (I didn’t have a change of clothes because the night before I was wearing a skirt with tights and turtleneck bodysuit so I had borrowed his sweatshirt to wear as pajamas.) He started yelling at me to take off his sweatshirt and I told him I would give it back to him when I saw him next. I tried walking past him to grab my things and he put his arm out blocking me and demanding that I take off his sweatshirt. I kept telling him that I promised to give it back and would try to get past him and he would use his arm out to prevent me from moving. He pretty much backed me into the wall and then grabbed the sweatshirt and pulled on it as if to rip it off of me. I finally was able to get past him and flinched when he took a step toward me after that happened because I wasn’t sure if he was going to grab me again. I got my things and started putting my shoes on. We got in his car and he was furious and started driving fast. I explained that I felt like this because of his actions in the past and that our trust just wasn’t built back up yet. I got home and reflected on everything that had happened. Hours later he texted me a huge paragraph apologizing for his inappropriate behavior. However he didn’t say anything about trying to rip the sweatshirt off me or backing me into the wall. Would you consider this physical abuse? Do you see this escalating in the future to him hitting me? I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. \n\nTLDR: When I told my boyfriend that I didn’t like the idea of him going to Vegas for his friends bachelor party we got in an argument. He got aggressive and put his arm out blocking me from moving and grabbing my things until I took off his sweatshirt. I told him I would give it back when I saw him next and he tried violently pulling it off. Is this abuse and do you think it will get worse?",

I was in the kitchen washing my hands and I turned around and her mom ripped her shirt and she only had her bra on! Then she ripped the bra. She grabbed one of her boobs and hit me in the face. My head hit the back of the counter and I fell on the floor. Then she took both of her boobs and started reapeatly hitting me on the head with them. I tried to crawl away but she kept hitting me. I eventually got on my feet, using the counter, but I ended up knocking over the rice my girlfriend was cooking.\n\nI also threw a cooking book at her she blocked it. I made a run for it downstairs, she went after me and was trying to hit me and ended up knocking over decor and breaking glass stuff. \n\nTLDR - My girlfriends phone call was over she came in the house and saw the pot knocked over and the mess left behind. She said \"was is there this mess?\" She comes downstairs confused and sees what's happening, then she yells \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\"",

        "text": "One of my  friends (M18) asked me (F18) out to prom a couple days ago. He’s had a crush on me for a couple months, but I don’t have feelings for him (we've been friends for about 2 years). When he asked, I said yes as long as he’s fine with it being platonic (which he agreed).\n\nHOWEVER, since then, I’ve been getting SEVERE anxiety about it (chest pain + increased heart rate + bad butterflies + jitters). It’s genuinely affecting my health and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to a dance with a date before, but my physical reaction wasn’t nearly this bad that time. I struggle with a little bit of social anxiety, but this is so much more than my usual levels. Maybe it’s because I only want to be friends with him; maybe I’m not mentally/emotionally ready to go on a date.\n\nThe anxiety is bad but bearable. I’m not sure if I should stick it through or back out. It’s senior year and we’re going to different colleges (he’s studying abroad) so I would feel bad for backing out after he finally worked up the courage to ask me before graduation.\n\nThoughts on what I should do? At the time of typing this, I’m leaning toward backing out by letting him know about my severe anxiety regarding this.\n\nWould really appreciate some advice for a socially awkward introvert :)\n\nTL;DR! Severe anxiety about platonic prom date",

        "text": "TW: weight, calories, restrictive eating disorders\n\nI have struggled with a restrictive eating disorder since I was a teenager and I had a particularly bad relapse over the course of almost 2 years from 2020-2022. Since then I’ve gotten on antidepressants and have been so much better, even though I still struggle with calorie counting and struggle to eat more than a protein bar for lunch (lunch is my hardest meal to recover from and eat fully). But I do still eat 3 meals per day plus snacks and am of a healthy weight for my height and age.\n\nMy boyfriend is the kindest person I have met in my life. He also struggles with body insecurities and 20 years ago he went through a bad episode of anorexia. When I cry, he cries. I have never met someone who loves and supports me more than he does and I know that he is going to be my life partner.\n\nHe is a bit overweight for his height (not sure if that’s an inclusive or shaming term but I mean objectively). Sometimes I get intrusive thoughts about his weight or worry if he’s been exercising or judge him internally/worry when he has a high calorie meal. Yesterday he said he wanted to get a snack and I said “that’s unhealthy”. And then I started crying because I felt so guilty for shaming him. I apologized and he didn’t mind the comment. But I feel horrible about it. And I feel horrible for at times wishing he were thinner like he used to be or getting anxious over HIS calories and exercise schedule. I feel like a fucking terrible person. \n\nHow can I stop? Do I need therapy again? Admittedly I have been in a bit of a relapse because I’ve gone through a week of complete food freedom and have experienced guilt.\n\ntldr; I have struggled with anorexia for years and so did my bf at a point, and I feel guilty for internally judging him for his food choices/weight, and I judged him externally for eating a snack and feel awful.

        "text": "I’ve been dating this girl, we’ll call her Emily, for 3 months now and it’s getting serious, with the potential of marriage in the near future. \n\nI know this seems weird, so I’ll explain how things are done in my parts of the world. \n2 people are introduced, both with the premise and intention of wanting to get married should they like each other. The dating is just to see if this person they’re dating is one meant to be their partner. \nSo they dating consistently for a period of anywhere between 3 weeks up to 2 months. After which, if they decide they like each other, have chemistry, and they values and life goals line up, they get engaged and married. \n\nEmily dated a guy name Dave for 2 months. She found him super charming, fun, smart, basically the perfect guy. (Side note, I actually know him personally, and her description of him makes sense. He always seemed like an amazing guy. We spent 2 years at the same high school. We were never really friends, but we were friendly with each other.)\n\nAnd so they got engaged. I myself went to their engagement party. Over the next few months of their engagement period, it was revealed that he was a narcissist. When out in public, he was his usual self; a lovable, friendly, charming guy. But when he would be alone with her he would become someone different. He became mean and harsh. Lacking empathy. He would yell at her and be demanding. \n\nThese are some of the things she told me he did: He repeatedly threatened her that he would break up if she didn’t do what he wanted. He became super controlling. One night he showed her a list he’d made of her pros and cons. He told her she has to change the cons about herself because he needs to make sure she makes him look good, and keep up his image. One example of a con, was that at dinner with friends, he wanted her to become a very loud and social talker, to keep up with him, so that people would think she’s “with it”. Mind you she’s already a loud and social person so this was a weird demand. Basically he wanted to turn her into his b**ch. \nEventually after a lot of these things happening, she mentally shut down and withdrew into herself out of shock and disbelief that this was the man she’s marrying, and how he changed. \nThroughout all this happening, the wedding was being planned and prepped. \nAbout a month before the wedding she found herself in a place of severe mental confusion, and hurt. She found herself not wanting to be in contact at all with her own fiancé. She didn’t want to talk or see him. \nShe realized she’d actually become scared of him and what he will do and say to her. And at this point she lost all her feeling for him. \nOne night they were on the phone and she didn’t want to say a word to him. After a bit, he got angry and finally followed through on his continuous threat. He was like, “I’m done with this” and broke it off. \n\nThis is her story. I feel inclined to believe it’s true. But I’m hesitant to draw conclusions as there’s always 2 sides to the story. I haven’t spoken to him about it, nor heard his side from gossip. \n\nI live in a tightly knit religious community. Where everyone’s social circles overlap and the sort of place where word spreads fast and wide. \n\nAfter the breakup he turned it all around on her telling people it was her fault and he did nothing wrong. \n \nShould I talk to him and have a conversations with him. Ask him for his side of the story and let him know, man to man, that I’m dating her. Being that I know him, I feel like it makes sense for me to tell him I’m dating his ex, rather than him finding out from someone else.\n\nOr will this only backfire and result in confrontation and probably my name slandered across the community. \n\nAnother option is to break up with the girl entirely seeing as, in the long run, It might not be in my best to get involved in this mess if I don’t have to. Get out while I can. \n\nIf I marry this girl I fear having to deal with him trash talking me and spewing lies about me. He incredibly popular and charismatic and my brain is telling me that he may turn people against me and that the unpleasantness isn’t worth it. \n\nI’m sure this is exactly what he want and is the reason he slandered her name. Which is to make sure that no one would want to be with her and that she wouldn’t be able to find happiness. \nBut all the same, as terrible as it is, it’s not my problem and I have to do what’s in my best interest. I could walk away right now and not have to have any of this in my life. \n\n\nI imagine that if I truly loved her none of this would matter and obviously I would want to be with her even in the face of all this. \nBut it’s been 3 months and I don’t feel that way. I really like her, but don’t love her. Maybe I need more time, or maybe time won’t change anything. Part of the reason I feel that time won’t change anything, is that I feel like I’m holding back, this is because of her distasteful past of a broken engagement and narcissist, psycho ex. I know this isn’t her fault, but it also doesn’t have to be my burden. \n\nAnd here is where it all ties together. Being that she’s been mentally ready to be married for the last 2 years, she doesn’t want to wait much longer with me. She is willing to wait 3 more months for me to be ready for marriage, or we will have to break up and she will go date someone who is ready. \nBut i don’t feel ready for marriage yet, and even if, realistically, I get myself ready, and am willing to get married in the next few months, it would feel like I’ve been pressured and rushed into it. \n\nHowever, she’s a really great girl, a good person, quite pretty, and we have great chemistry. She’s ride or die, and loves me for who I am. Doesn’t care if I’m broke, just wants to build a life with me. And I don’t want to lose her. \n\nSo I have a decision to make: continue down this road with her, bearing in mind my current feelings for her, and my uneasiness of her past and ex. Or break up and potentially lose a really great girl. \n\n\nTLDR: \nGf has narcissist ex and broken engagement. She want me to be ready for marriage in the next 6 months. Should I break up with her?",

        "text": "I want to start off by saying that I am a bisexual women who leans more toward lesbian, and that my boyfriend and I both identify as queer. He brought the idea of a threesome with another women  around November of last year. He stressed that it would only work if we were equally interested in it. At first I was against it because I thought it would put too much stress on our relationship, but the idea of a threesome in general has always been interesting to me. His response was basically that he understood where I was coming from and wouldn't bring it up again. After some time, I thought about it, and felt as though it could be positive for both of us, as it would allow me to have more experiences with women.\n\nSince then, we had 3 threesomes that went really well. We found women through tinder, and our main criteria was that the woman identify as bisexual or pansexual, so that my boyfriend and I would have equal enjoyment in the experience (because she'd be into both of us).\n\nThe last threesome went terribly, not because of me or my partner, but because of the third woman. Her tinder profile said that she identified as bisexual, however, the events that took place made me question that. She also said she had had threesomes in the past with another couple, so I thought things would be fine. Here's where things went wrong.\n\nFor starters, we were in the midst of discussing what music playlist should be put on at my apartment when I said I was going to run to the bathroom. When I come out, she's already straddling my boyfriend, and he's giving me a look like \"I don't know what's happening right now.\" The fact that she chose to initiate as soon as I walked away was a red flag. It felt shady. I sit next to them, confused, still trying to figure out what's going on with the playlist. My boyfriend is trying to communicate with me, but she's completely ignoring the conversation. She starts making half-hearted attempts to touch me while straddling him, and I feel like during the times she does interact with me, they feel more \"for show\" rather than a bisexual woman hooking up with another women. Throughout the threesome, the best way I can describe it is that she gets possessive over my own boyfriend and prevents me from interacting with him. He tries his best to continually try to get me involved with no help from her. We cut the threesome pretty short because of this, and I end up even having to kick her out because she tries to fall asleep on my bed for the night.\n\nMy boyfriend handled the situation well in that he was very attuned to the fact that she was only interacting with him and was trying to leave me out of the experience. However, I've already always been somewhat insecure about the idea of women trying to \"steal\" my boyfriend, as he is quite good-looking and it's happened in the past (though he's been good at handling it and telling me throughout the duration of our relationship). This experience has really been stressing me out lately. I'm thinking that we should stop having threesomes, but I've been enjoying them up to this point.\n\ntl;dr my bf and I have threesomes and I usually enjoy them, but the last one went so poorly that it's caused me to become insecure",

        "text": "He said it a few weeks ago, but it’s still really bothering me. I’m not sure if it’s worth mentioning since I don’t want to make him feel bad because I know how guilty he feels about saying it and how much he regrets it. His frustration got the best of him.\n\nHe’d had a very frustrating day so far (most of our days have been very tiring lately, I just escaped from my abusive parents’ household and it feels like I’m having to learn how to be a human again) and he just snapped.\n\nWe live with his mum, who gave him guidance beforehand on how to word his frustration appropriately (we’re both autistic), but he still ended up hurting my feelings. He loves me to pieces, I know that, but he’s blunt and struggles with anger.\n\nHe sat me down and told me that he’s been very stressed with how chaotic our lives have been lately (I had to move in with him and his mum very suddenly rather than wait until we planned to move out together, there’s multiple police investigations into my parents, social services deemed my parents as safe, my family have been sending him threatening messages, etc) which I emphasised with, but then he straight up told me that I need to help out more and that he’s ‘tired of babysitting me’ and that he’s exhausted.\n\nThat hurt. A lot. I managed to keep my composure until we finished talking, and then I went to the bathroom and cried. That was the first time he’s ever said anything negative to me and I’m really sensitive, but what hurt the most is that he’ll never understand how hard this is for me or how hard I’m trying to keep going.\n\nI help him out where I can, I try and make myself useful, but I’m so fucking tired and anxious and on edge. I’m sleeping a lot, sure, but I’m doing everything else the best I can. I’m trying my hardest, I’m not making him do everything.\n\nI returned to his room after making sure it wasn’t obvious that I was upset because I didn’t want to make him feel bad, and he apologised, but something just snapped inside me.\n\nI don’t cry in front of people, but there I was, sobbing and apologising over and over and telling him that I’m trying my hardest and asking him if he was tired of me.\n\nHe reassured me that he would never get tired of me and that things are just hard right now, and that I just need to ‘pull my weight’ a bit more, and if I do that then we’ll be fine.\n\nHe doesn’t understand how tired I am right now and that I’m doing *everything I can* to keep functioning as normally as possible. I don’t know what he expects me to do - I’m doing everything he’s asking me to.\n\nI spoke to his mum and told her that he’s not good at wording things gently. She agreed, and told me that she’d given him advice on what to say, but it seems he was just too stressed to retain it or decided that I needed to hear it.\n\nI love him so much, and he has never once shown me what he looks like when he’s struggling with his anger, and I am so so proud of him for that. I know how hard he tries for me.\n\nI’m just struggling now that he’s said that. I’m taking every opportunity I can to do something for him because I’m terrified that I’m a burden to him and that I’m going to annoy him. I’m also worried that I’m being too sensitive, I’m trying my best to remember that he didn’t mean it.\n\nDo I bring it up to him? I understand his frustration completely and I know that I’m probably lacking a little right now, but at the same time, I feel bad not telling him that it’s getting me down and making me feel the need to ‘prove myself’. I’m worried that it might prompt a conversation that’s purely negative rather than a resolution, making bringing it up a bad idea, but I want him to understand things from my perspective.\n\n**TL;DR: boyfriend says he’s ‘tired of babysitting me’ when I’m exhausted due to just escaping my abusive parents’ home and trying to find my place in the world among other things and I don’t know if I should tell him that I’m now terrified of him feeling that way again.**",

I don’t see why people who knows he’s taken would continually ask him out, pass other women’s numbers to him. \n\nI just checked his recently deleted and he has multiple messages from coworkers asking him out for drinks, giving him female coworkers numbers because they have a crush on him, etc. \n\nHe just deletes the messages which is troubling because we have a no delete policy. We both decided we wouldn’t delete messages from our phones as an act of transparency but I don’t usually check his text. I only checked the recently deleted to see if he had been deleting anything after finding out about the existence of such a folder. \n\nSo anyways, the messages are just deleted. He doesn’t respond. He hasn’t told me about them either though which is so strange to me. I don’t tend to overreact with things like this either; when girls reach out, I’m usually playful because I know we are both high value partners. I joke that every girl wants him and that they can’t find out how truly amazing he is as a partner or else they’d try to steal him away. So I don’t think he’d deleted them to avoid conflict. \n\nI’m waiting for him to get out of a class right now and I’m kind of spiraling over this. I do plan to talk to him about it promptly. \n\nIs this sketchy or am I in my head?\n\nTLDR: boyfriends coworkers don’t seem to know he’s in a long term cohabitation relationship with someone.",

        "text": "Me and my wife have been married 5 years and been together for 10. So back in Oct 2022 I had a day off work and my wife had to go to work this day. She recently got a new phone and her old phone was in the drawer on her nightstand. Usually I never go through her phone it's not who I am. But I found her old phone while cleaning and decided to look through her messages. She was texting this guy whose name I heard her mention before as an old friend from highschool, she has a few friends she text from highschool so I thought no big deal. I look through these texts and there is sexual talk and memes and talking about the sex they had in the past. I should mention that we have a rule where we don't talk to past exes. Now I see all these texts going back over a year. The last time they talked was 7 days before I found these texts. I took a couple pics and confronted her. She cried took her phone back and deleted the whole text thread. But I also notice she deleted another name besides the one guy I saw the texts. I confront her on that as well and she says that she talked about some of our problems with this other guy. I didn't see any of those texts but knowing how she was texting the one I read it can't be good. The one I read she was talking about what I don't do in the bedroom with her and how she wishes she could be with another woman. (I see it as cheating even if it is a female.) And this guy starts trashing me, he doesn't even know me and my wife is agreeing with him. I'm trying my hardest to try in reconcile this relationship but I keep seeing the shit I read in her phone I take some steps backwards. If anybody has any advise or similar stories that could help would be greatly appreciated\n\nTL;DR Caught wife texting another man inappropriately and don't know what to do or how to reconcile.",

As in, right now I feel attracted to her, but I'm anxious I'll eventually not find her attractive anymore.\n\nIt mostly revolves around her gaining enough weight that I won't find her attractive anymore, and that makes me feel like a terrible husband to even think about, but it has been a prevalent thought in my mind for some time now.\n\nwe've been together 11 years and our bodies have, naturally, changed. We also have one young daughter and my wife's body is obviously different from how it used to, but I've always loved her body and have never felt unattracted to her in the time we've been together, yet the thought of losing attraction to her worries me.\n\nThe strangest thing for me is that we would have never married if all we saw in each other was an attractive body, and over the years I've found that I appreciate many more things about her than her physical appearance. I'm deeply attracted to her dedication to our marriage, our daughter, her parents, her work, and many other traits that enhance my sexual attraction for her.\n\nI feel attracted to her in a way that I'll never feel about any other woman. And yet I've been unable to stop worrying about specifically finding her physically unattractive despite the fact that it's never been only about finding her attractive, and despite the fact that 11 years later and mutual body changes, I still find her deeply attractive.\n\nwhy am I suddenly worried about not finding her attractive? I feel like it's limiting my capacity to enjoy our marriage. how to work this out?\n\n**tl;dr:** Recently I've been irrationally afraid of losing attraction for my wife and can't figure out why.

My friend (lets call them H) and another person at the party were being (from my perspective) competitive to each other, but in a friendly way. At one point, the other person asked H if he had gotten a category correct and H said he had, but I happened to look at his ballot and noticed he lied. Later on he somehow made it look like he has picked the correct winner, but I am 100% sure that I looked at his ballot and he had picked the wrong winner and lied about it. He ended up \"winning\" the small prize.\n\nNow sure, that isn't a huge deal, but I'm a little worried because being a sore loser or needing to win seems to be a pattern of behavior. Another time we were playing a video game, and he was getting upset that another friend kept beating him at the game and unplugged their controller.\n\nBoth situations involved drinking, so I honestly don't know if this would happen while he's sober, but at the same time I wonder if this HAS happened before and I've just never noticed. I don't know. I'm struggling on whether or not to bring this up to H, or possibly talk to H's partner about it, or just let it go and see if this pattern continues. \n\nTLDR: I caught a friend cheating on our Oscar ballot and he has a history of being a sore loser. I can't decide whether to bring it up or not. any help is appreciated, thank you",

        "text": "I started living with my boyfriend pretty early on into our relationship. After 8 months I moved out because he ended up not being able to pay rent due to becoming unemployed and unmotivated to find work. I told him the next time I pay rent in full alone I’m done and that’s what I did so I moved back home with my parents and we broke up. Beyond this, our relationship was very intense. He gave me a promise ring and promised he would love me forever. He’s never had issues with other women, cheating, being unfaithful, etc. He constantly showed me off online, to his friends and family. I do think he really loves me. The only problem was his financial issues and having a big ego thinking things will always go his way. Well 2 months go by and he gets a job, starts cleaning up his act. We got back together and since then he’s been begging me to move back in with him. Saying he’s changed a lot and has been proving it to me constantly. He said he misses me being there everyday and it will be better for both of us since he knows I miss him too. I usually visit on the weekends to stay with him and when I’m there he always cooks or takes me out, keeps his apartment extra clean, cares for me. I’m afraid to move back and have him rely on me for money again or go back to his old ways. We fought a lot when we lived together and my schedule wasn’t as maintained as I would have preferred. I also love being home. I love my hometown, my commute to work, having alone time and being focused during the week and seeing him on the weekends for fun. He said if I actually envision my future with him and take him as seriously as i say I would come back. I tell him if he loved me he would be patient with me and wait for when I’m ready. I love him a lot and see the good in him, but he can be very manipulative and not take the time to actually understand me. Any thoughts? \n\n\nTLDR: i got back with my boyfriend after he was unable to pay rent while living together. He got a job and is doing a lot better. Wants me to move back but nervous to make the same mistakes.",

I was never the jealous type and didn’t really care for her guy friends. She would tell me which guys she finds attractive and I did that too for girls. Pretty chill\n\n\nAround New Year’s she started telling me and her friends she wants to have sex with a mutual friend, let’s call him Jack. I wasn’t really jealous bc I was confident and went along with her like “yeah he’s hot haha”.\n\n\nOn the 1st of January my friend group was making a party she went to. I didn’t because I was feeling down. Basically they all got pretty drunk and tommorow she told me how she hooked up with Jack, and she had hickeys on her chest he left her. She talked openly about it with no guilt. I felt kinda betrayed. I told her that bothers me and she told me she did it all on purpose because I showed her no attention and she wanted to see if I really don’t care about her that much. I got mad, told her that was a POS move, but forgave her tommorow.\n\n\nFast forward to couple weeks ago. It kinda just hit me again and I told her I’m kinda insecure about it and I wanna talk what really happened that night bc I didn’t believe her she did it on purpose, and I think she has feelings for him (or maybe just wants to fuck him). She swore that she doesn’t care about him and she would block him on IG. I told her not to do that bc I’m not like that.\n\n\nWe were at a birthday party this Saturday. I went early bc I wasn’t feeling well. Later that night I saw on someone’s close friend story a video of a couple people in the club toilet. My gf and Jack were in the video and she seemed all over him. I was so hurt but I felt I was just really paranoid. I felt like a toxic POS bringing this up to her, and she got mad and told me I’m being paranoid and over dramatic.\n\n\nToday, a mutual friend of ours told me how my gf often says she doesn’t care about me, and that she is all over Jack when I’m not there.\n\n\nI’ve made up my mind, I’m breaking up with her in a couple hours. I think I owe myself to just curse her off because how she made me feel, and bc I feel betrayed and humiliated. Should I go this way, let all my feelings out or do it nicely?",

        "text": "TL;DR I walked out in front of my husband's family he wanted to stay longer after we agreed to leave at a certain time.\n\n \n\nMight  be a long one! I (30F) was out with my husband (29M) all day yesterday  and our last stop was to his family's house for a get together they do  every month (sometimes I skip these but since I was already with him, I  went).  Before we went inside, we agreed on a time to leave and I made  sure we were both in agreement with the time which was 5pm. In the past  we have agreed on times and there have been some instances where we  don't leave at the time we agreed cuz one of us wants to stay longer.   We stay later and sometimes I'm mad but I let it go cuz it's not  something to fight over.  He gets mad too but lets it go.  Most of the  times it's a Saturday so it's ok if we stay later.  However, yesterday  was Sunday and we planned to do things once we got home and we wanted to  get ready for work the next day.\n\nIt  was getting close to 5 and I was ready to go.  Once it was 5, he told  his fam we were leaving but then they decided to begin their family  discussion they do every month.  My husband wanted to stay longer to  listen but we had agreed to leave.  In the past, staying longer can mean  anywhere from 5 min to an hour or longer. I got upset and said I'll  wait in the car.  I walked out in front of everyone without saying bye  or anything.  I know I shouldn't have gotten an attitude and walk out  like I did. I feel like I disrespected my in-laws home.  I went to the  car and was upset and then my husband came out a few min later.  He said  he'll just come to his family get togethers without me. I told him we  agreed to leave at a certain time and I was mad he wanted to stay  longer.\n\nWe started fighting which  is what i did not want to happen.  I thought setting a time would avoid a  fight and we can just go home and do what we had planned and end the  night happy.  We both know it's our fault for fighting and we both need  to do better at communicating when one of us wants to stay.  I should  have told him no we need to leave instead of walking out.  But i was  also expecting him to be firm and tell his family we can't stay.  I felt  disappointed in him cuz why can't we just stick to the plan.  We're  always changing plans which i hate but i have gotten more patient and  learned that it's ok but sometimes i would like to just stick to what we  agreed.\n\nI love plans,  organization, and times. I grew up like that and was also in the  military.  He is more of a go with the flow person.  We are different  but we both need to find a middle ground when it comes to leaving  events.  We agreed that I won't join him for his family get togethers  cuz I honestly get bored and have no one to talk to so that's the best  option and I'm cool with it.  For other events we both attend, this is  where we'll struggle and not sure how to handle it.  Ughhh it's hard.   We can't be picking and choosing when one of us wants to stay longer and  then get mad. We need to be a team and stick to the plan.\n\n Any suggestions or ideas on how we can do better and not have this cause a fight?",

        "text": "I apologize for the format, I’m on mobile and very distraught. \nMy boyfriend of two years have been separated from his Wife for years before me. He lives with me, his wife and I know about each other and have spoken several times. However she refuses to get an official divorce, she has stated she will ruin his life and mine if he attempts to file a divorce. As well as get him for adultery despite them being separated.  \n\nAll of this is for money. She has access to his account, he doesn’t even have a log in to see what he has in the bank. She transfers and shifts money all the time. I’ve asked him to open up a new account to stop this, he doesn’t want to because it will “stir her up”. She someone has access to his entire phone and has saved private/intimate pictures of me that have been threatened to be used if no one complies. She’s also the only one who has access to his medical information, she’s refused to get his pills ready at a pharmacy close to us. She insist he has to pick them up from her or she drops them off to him. they’re sharing locations on his phone, he doesn’t take it off because he’s afraid it will upset her. These two years together with him he has still gone over there to fix appliances, anything she asks to make sure she doesn’t retaliate. I’ve begged him to stand up for himself, stop asking permission and take control of his life. He gets mad with me whenever I bring the situation up. I feel like the way this hurts me doesn’t matter to him, that I’m on the back burner. He threatens to leave me, I tell him to just leave because I’m tired of hurting and not having someone that is entirely just mine, but he never actually leaves. He makes promises of when he will officially break everything off, every date every promise he never does. They still communicate everyday about “important stuff”.\n\nThis weekend I absolutely had a meltdown over everything because I found him looking at other women on his phone. This was just the last straw with me. I have been putting up with disrespect from the other situation now this. \n\nI tried to leave and he threatened to make phone calls, tell me he’s not scared of my family, ruin my life, and burn the house down if I pulled out of the driveway. \n\nI’m at a complete loss on what to do. I could lose my job, have my family cut me off. I’m worried for myself and my pets. \n\nTL;DR boyfriend refuses to get a divorce from “ex” wife. Being black mailed and threatened if I leave him because of that issue.",

        "text": "Trigger warning: unaliving\n\nTldr: my ex tried to guilt trip me for seeing a friend after an unsuccessful unalive attempt. He took screenshots of  my Facebook story from a burner account and is using it against me to hurt me even more. \n\nJust a little backstory: we'd  been trying to break it off for 2 weeks since our relationship had become toxic and abusive (sometimes physical on his end). After our Iast blowout  I had a unalive attempt due to the intense pain and drama. He was the one that called the police and my mom to make sure I was ok but after still acted distant and said he wanted to break up. I accepted it.  I managed to avoid getting locked up in inpatient and as soon as i got out the hospital i went to my friend's party because I had flaked on her 3 times already due to having mental health issues in this relationship and she's the only friend i have left. I was only at the party an hour and drank water because i was exhausted and drowsy. I took a picture with her holding a glass of water and posted it to my fb story.  He screenshoted my Facebook story (he has me blocked on fb but watches me on other accounts) with her and sent it to me with a text accusing me of faking my unalive attempt and being reckless and toxic.  All of this because I chose not to take his calls since i was exhausted and didn't want to fight after i came home that night. I promised myself I wouldn't respond to him anymore but that assassination of my character riled me up and I just told him he's completely wrong and to no longer contact me.  I feel guilty for reacting, but maybe I shouldn't have gone  to a party after  that whole ordeal? I know it didn't look the best but if he would've asked I could've told him I've didn't stay long nor drink and I've been in bed ever since.",

        "text": "I (21F) am with my bf (22M) for almost 7 months and since the beginning, I know his mental health isn't the best. Before we got together he mutilated his whole arm but refused to talk about it. \n\nSince we've been together, he's more open and confides in me a lot. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he often felt sad without knowing why. Having physical pain made him feel good and made him forget his thoughts. But he said he knew it was bad &amp; he wanted to stop being \"like this\". I suggested that he go to therapy to try to understand all this, and he had few appointments until now. \n\nOne day he said that sometimes he's thinking about \"how it would be great if he disappeared\". He didn't talk about suicide and I'm not sure if he actually has suicidal thoughts but it made me sad and had no idea what to answer him.\n\nSince then, I thought he got better. He had stopped self-harm and seemed less sad. I was happy bc his arm recovered. \nHowever, one week ago we were sitting cross-legged on his bed. I saw cuts under his foot. I didn't think what it could be before stupidly asking \"hey what's this?\" thinking he cut while walking barefoot on something. He immediately hid it and said, \"it's nothing\" before telling a joke and acting as if nothing happened. So I guessed he did it himself. A bit after, I tried to ask him if he was OK in general and he answered that he was. \n\nHonestly, he seems fine 85% of the time but the 15 other percent are making me worried. \n\nI don't know if I should talk about this with him or how to do it. I love him and want to help but I feel useless. It's weird to say that but I kind of feel like I'm not enough. I know it's technically not my business but it's also affecting me since we're together.\n\nPlz don't tell me he just needs to take medicine because it's not my job and he's already having counselling sessions so I have no power over it. Of course, I encourage him to continue them. \nI would just like to know how to react in this kind of situation and how to help him on my scale. What to do and to don't do in order to help him with his mental health. \n\nThanks :))\n\nTL;DR: I don't know what behavior to have with my boyfriend who has fragile mental health (but who hides it) especially when he's cutting himself and feeling sad.",

        "text": "I desperately need advice. My (27F) boyfriend (29M, together for almost a year) starts following girls and only likes their suggestive photos/selfies on Instagram - never any other content they post. And they’re not influencers or girls with hundreds of thousands or millions of followers. They follow him back and like his photos too. So to me he’s sending them a ‘message’ that says “I’m interested / I like what I see” and they RECEIVE that message. \n\nThese are also girls that he starts following since after we started dating, meaning he went to their profile, thought “oh yeah, she’s hot, I’m going to follow her” then went on to like their photos with their tits out/bikini photos, even sometimes while I’m sleeping in bed next to him. I’m somewhat confident in my own appearance but any confidence I do have, this just destroys it. Many of these girls look the complete opposite of me. \n\nWhen I was single and would post photos maybe showing a lot of cleavage or in a bikini, when guys with girlfriends would like them I used to think “how embarrassing for her, he’s making her look stupid”. And now I’m in that position. It makes me sad because I love him and ADORE him so much that I don’t even want to see other guys shirtless photos. I desire no one but him. I wish the feeling was mutual and it really hurts to be the one that loves more. \n\nInstagram sucks sometimes. \n\nTl;Dr my bf likes girls suggestive photos on Instagram and it hurts me. Is it reasonable to ask him to stop following them / liking their photos? If so, how do I bring it up without sounding crazy?",

        "text": "About four months ago, I found out my wife was engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations online with another guy. Her dead libido was suddenly in overdrive. At first, I was happy, but I felt something was off. A couple of weeks later, I found out. They met playing the MMO Apex\n\nShe swore she stopped seeing him, and we began counseling.\n\nThis afternoon, my daughter and I went to the movies and were going to make another afterward for my job, but the plant called me, and our plans changed. \n\nWe made a stop for food on the way home and still arrived a good hour earlier than expected. My wife was playing Apex and setting down her phone when we walked in. Apex has a phone messaging app, so players can chat outside of the game. I sat down in the recliner with my Taco Bell, not thinking anything of it. She started acting weird. In hindsight, she acted like I had caught her doing something. \n\nShe said she wasn't expecting me home so soon. At the same time one of the guys she always plays with (Fid) had invited her to play, and she said to me, \"hang on, I need to see who he's playing with first because sometimes he plays with Don.\" Don is the guy she cheated with. She checks the name of the other player, makes a point to tell me it's not Don, and then plays a few games. What's weird is that she plays with Fid a lot; this was the first time she acted like this.\n\nThe whole time she was playing, she kept acting very nervous. She plays in the TV room, and I normally zone out on my phone while she plays. One thing to add... this week I flew out of state for four days for my job. The last time she got involved with someone online I was working out of state.\n\nShe handles the accounting in our company. In nearly twenty years she has never once given me a financial statement. I've asked repeatedly, and it was brought up years ago in counseling, but she still fails to provide this information. I've been so busy working that I don't harp on it all the time. \n\nAfter the first affair/ incident,  the dawning realization of the myriad implications and impacts of her potential financial malfeasance were terrifying. Last month, she told me she opened three personal bank accounts. Because of this, I'm in the process of hiring a forensic accountant. \n\nThis weekend, she said that she still had issues with Quickbooks (the package she's used since 2007). According to Quickbooks, she said, it days we should have made 300K last year, but she swears we didn't. It's entirely possible that this is true, yet at the same time, the whole situation looks rather awkward \n\nI don't want to be an alarmist, but I suspect my wife is still seeing the guy and has been stealing from my company.\n\nThe next step is getting proof, but it sounds like that's the least of my short-term concerns. The bigger question is what do I do tomorrow, next week, and next month.\n\nI could move to our other property and stay there, but how will that affect our daughter? I'd love to be wrong about everything, yet it seems as if she isn't aware of her behavioral changes - which also occurred when she had the previous affair/incident.\n\n\ntl/dr: it looks like I walked in on something she didn't want me to see. It looks like she rekindled her affair. On top of this, she may be stealing from the company.",
