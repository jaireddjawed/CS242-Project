        "text": "I'm honestly not even sure if this is the right place to make such a request, but I'm pretty desperate at this point so I figure it wouldn't hurt.\n\nSome background - my GF and I got into crosswords recently, and been having a lot of fun doing one every weekend together. With her birthday coming up, I thought it would be cute to make her a custom crossword puzzle consisting of a bunch of inside jokes as part of her gift.\n\nWhile working on the crossword, I thought it would be a cool idea to include a hidden message that was revealed once the puzzle was solved. So I built her a \"happy birthday\" website with some cute pics and some other sappy stuff, and hid the URL in the puzzle (marked with pink squares).\n\nAt this point I decided that it would be fun to extend the challenge and build out a little scavenger hunt - just around the house + a couple of spots near by.\n\nThe goal of the event isn't really to have the most difficult puzzles, but rather a number of \"fun\" rhyming riddles leading to the final clue (which is the website).\n\nUnfortunately, this task has proven a little harder than I expected it to. I started working backwards from the crossword, and here's what I have so far with just 3 days to go...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Flowers**\n\nI will hand her flowers with the first card – which will initiate the challenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;needs riddle leading to TABLE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Under the table**\n\nNext card will be found here, and should pick up the difficulty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;needs riddle leading to FREEZER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Freezer**\n\nI will freeze the next card in a giant block of ice. This card will contain a riddle, as well as a hidden NFC tag that will need to be scanned to continue.\n\n*On the back, this clue will also have a phone number written in UV invisible ink that will be referenced in a future clue*\n\nOnce the NFC tag has been scanned, Siri will announce the next hint which lead to the dryer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;needs riddle leading to DRYER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Dryer**\n\nIn here she will find her first gift and a clue leading to somewhere else in the house (record player / bathtub / bedside table / bookshelf / etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;needs riddle to CLUE 5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Somewhere else inside the house / TBD**\n\nIn this part she will find a UV flashlight, as well as a riddle which will require her to revisit the previous clue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Goodluck my bean,*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*This torch will let you see unseen.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Just take a breath, let darkness in –*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the **frigid** clue has more within…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Calling the invisible phone number will play a message with a set of coordinates*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;might not need a riddle here, but open to it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Geocache**\n\nWhen the coordinates are visited, she will find a box with a final clue directing her to look under the rug. This is what I have so far, but it's not much of a puzzle...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*What once was hidden is now revealed,*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*You’ll find a clue when rug is peeled.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7. Rug**\n\nUnder the rug will be an envelope with the crossword, as well as the final clue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Complete this puzzle, if you're wise -*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Letters in pink reveal your prize!*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*And if you're stuck, your face gone blue -*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Just take a shot, and get a clue.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Crossword Hint**\n\nWe've been drinking by this point, and if she requests a clue on how to unscramble the letters , this is what she will receive:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*From south to north, and east to west –*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*the final clue takes its shape best.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*If you’re not sure what to spell*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*–the letters form a URL*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEffectively, I need A LOT of help to piece this together, I still need clues for #1,2, 3, 4, and probably a better 6.\n\nTo give you an idea for what I'm going for, refer to numbers 7&amp;8 for the length &amp; pattern – I'm pretty happy with those..\n\nI realize that I'm asking for a lot here, but **any** help would be greatly appreciated. If anyone is interested in helping me make this day special, please DM me and I would be more than happy to compensate for your time.\n\nI really appreciate anyone reading through this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: bit off more than I can chew, and desperately need help creating some rhyming riddles",
