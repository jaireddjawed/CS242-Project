It is perfectly possible (according to Jerome McGann) that the effort could be put forth to correct the 1922 Shakespeare and Company Edition, and produce a truly corrected text as close as possible to how Joyce originally intended it. Has any will or want for a new edition been bubbling up recently?",

My main advisor has kept up a contradictory string of remarks throughout my prospectus (proposal) writing process, saying things like, \"You're getting very close but it still needs more work\" while being very vague. I have re-written my prospectus (almost from scratch) three times. I had a prospectus defense recently, where he said that apparently it wasn't \"compelling\" enough (these comments came out of the blue, because over the summer his only comments were that my draft was fine) and that I needed to rewrite it. I have been working on just this proposal since November, and it is now September. I'm not sure I have the mental or emotional strength to rewrite this again, especially because I'm not sure what he wants, and it's difficult to get in touch with any of my advisors. \n\nI'm supposed to turn it in about a month, but haven't even started working on this 4th prospectus yet. I just feel like I don't care about anything anymore. I don't need counseling - what I need is an advisor, but unfortunately that's not possible right now. \n\nAny thoughts on what to do? I've considered talking to the chair of my department, but unfortunately there's no way I could be sure that my complaints would be kept confidential. \n\nSincerely,\nDespondent ",

I think he described it as a field in which writers actually challenged themselves to write about something terribly boring or mundane (perhaps in beautiful or compelling ways?). There was even a term for it, because I looked it up on Wikipedia. There's apparently a seminal book in the field about something stupid, like a desk chair or a lacquer table or something. \n\nI know this is super vague, but can anyone think of what that field of writing might be?

The war ends and they eventually formulate a plan to meet.  She will wait for him outside a bar they can both find.  \n\nAs he approaches the bar on the appropriate day, he sees a woman standing in the place where his pen pal is supposed to be.

He considers following her but doesn't want to hurt the feelings of the woman he's been falling in love with through letters.  He pauses a second.  \n\nHe finally walks up to the lady standing outside the bar and introduces himself.  She has no idea who he is but mentions that the beautiful woman who just left the bar told her that if a man comes asking for the name X, she's supposed to tell the man to follow the beautiful woman to some specific place.

Set in the fifth or fourth century BC, it involves a Greek envoy to the Persian court who is expected to bow to the Great King, but for whom doing so would be inconsistent with his understanding of Greek freedom. So he gets around the problem by dropping a ring at the crucial moment and bending down to pick it up. To everyone else it looks as though he has bowed, but in fact he has subverted the custom by providing himself with a different motivation for his action.\n\nAs a classicist, I have a strong suspicion that this is not an ancient narrative: Herodotus, who would be the most likely source, does indeed mention that Greek envoys refused to bow to the Persian king Xerxes (VII 136), but there are no details or clever tricks, and none of the standard commentaries on the passage refer to my friend's story as a parallel or contrast. In fact, it feels to me like something that might have been invented in the context of German philhellenism (and my friend is German, and was brought up on that stuff): Goethe, Schiller, maybe even Lessing or one of those guys.

        "text": "I am just wondering how this text was received (or whether it was regarded at all) by literary scholars. Bauerlein uses a few \"big\" names as the target of his critique: Bhabha, Jameson, and so on, so it might be considered a rather controversial book. \n\nIf you have read this, what are your thoughts? Or, is it a text  you've never paid any attention to? It does strike a chord with me, in regards to the conceptual fuzziness of a lot of literary theory. \n\nEDIT: I realise that this topic might not be useful without some quotes, so I'll take an excerpt from one of the book's entries. The reason I initially didn't provide one is because Bauerlein's style of writing is somewhat tortuous. He takes quite a while to develop his argument, so it's hard to quote summative pieces of text. Here are parts taken from his critical examination of 'what so-and-so calls', where he examines scholars who write, e.g. 'What Barthes called the 'logothete' or 'What Foucault calls 'the care of the self' and so on. \n\n&gt; A certain mode of citation has cropped up in criticism recently, a type of allusion whose novelty and frequency bears some analysis. This is the \"what so-and-so calls x\" gesture, the reference to some other scholar's or philosopher's name for a social, discursive, or textual phenomenon. [...] In other words, citation replaces definition. Allusion renders a fuller description unnecessary. Instead of delineating what it is, critics say offhand what others have called it and leave it at that.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; In the interest of scholarly communication, one assumes, the critic borrows another's authoritative phrase and tacks it on to his own phrasing, collegially aligning his interpretation with the other's. The only originality of the assertion itself lies in the critic's connection of this particular subject matter with that cited critic's general term.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; However, in doing so, the \"what so-and-so calls x\" formula does not enhance an explicit definition or description of the labeled phenomena. It substitutes for them. In the above passages, the cited calls terminate the representation of the thing at hand. Little empirical information or logical analysis follows. The commentary smoothly proceeds to other issues, as if the critic's identification of a thing that some critical authority has given a label to sufficiently characterizes the thing. The critics argue as if the citation distinguishes the thing adequately enough so that further analysis is not required. \n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; Although these citations are posed as clarifications, in fact they function more as circumlocutions. Certainly, any reference to a related interpretation, one that has produced an edifying name for the object under consideration, may favor the argument. The reference may give readers more clues as to what conceptual framework obtains in the discussion. But in the absence of thorough and patient inquiry into the immediate subject, such references raise more questions than they answer. For example: does the name really apply here? The critic quoting it posits its relevance, but does not bother to ponder if or how the call can validly be pulled from one context and inserted into another.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; The implication is that the term carries its authority within itself, not in its just correspondence to a state of affairs, and so its mere mention sufficiently justifies it. It enjoys an already established legitimacy, and so any further explanation of it is unnecessary. Such a casual yet positive reference renders the term or phrase unassailable. The brevity of its appearance prevents readers from appraising its propriety. The only information accompanying the term is the name of its originator. Apparently, because a more or less noted scholar coined the term, it possesses accuracy and validity.\n\nCertainly there are authors who write in this way and still make clear, insightful arguments. But this kind of writing, I suggest, is too easily misused by people to cover up for a lack of, at the least a competence in explanation and paraphrasing, or at the worst a total lack of conceptual understanding or insight. I think what attracts me to Bauerlein's criticisms is that he focuses on how these small things are, in fact, quite heavy with presuppositions. I'm still only a young grasshopper when it comes to this stuff, so I may be totally wrong! ",
