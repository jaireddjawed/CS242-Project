So the motor/inductive load for the pump would not start till 15min after power comes to the pump in all scenarios.

Basically, they're recoilless guns, except the breech stays locked for just long enough to impart more energy onto the projectile while still being able to cancel out at least most of the recoil.\n\nRight now, I am working on a fantasy world set several centuries after an apocalypse which ended a sort of near future civilization. They're thrown back to the technological level of the early 19th century and dig up various artifacts along the way. This also includes remains and records of futuristic weapons they often can't reproduce, but often try.\n\nSo I was wondering, once this post apocalyptic civilization gets back to a 1920s/30s level of technology, looking for ways their infantry can counter early tanks, would it be technologically feasible to build something like the Carl Gustaf 20 mm pansarvärnsgevär m/42, but as a shoulder fired RAVEN gun? What would the advantages over a conventional anti tank rifle be?\n\nI can already imagine what the disadvantage would be: Cost. RAVEN guns sound very complicated to manufacture, so if this is at all feasible, I would give it to only a single faction with highly developed industry.",

Honestly I'm not super observant and we don't spend a ton of time up there, so it's possible this predates the renovations, but I don't know. I also don't know if they're growing since I only noticed them today.\n\nHow concerned should we be? We will probably get a structural engineer in to do an actual assessment, but is this likely to be a dangerous/urgent situation where we should, like, get out of the house and stay out until it's assessed? Or is that just my anxiety talking?\n\nPictures: https://imgur.com/a/wrXsgCe",

The current system is to use gloves and change them out every 30 minutes.  We were informed by a second opinion oncologist that she had better results during her personal treatment (she was also a BC survivor) by modifying current therapeutic cold water circulation systems (for knees usually) into glove and feet protections. The object is to effectively cool her hands to bone white by circulating constant cold water from a cooler of ice water.\n\nI am putting together what I think I will need to create a system that can work but would love someone with better understanding help me plan to avoid mistakes that could add time to me being able to put together this system. We have about two weeks before the treatment begins. \n\nI would like to include the following \"must haves\" to bring everyone interested up to speed.\n\n1. Must include a backup water pump incase the first one breaks down.\n2. Must tightly cover the hands and feet top and bottom to effectively cut off blood circulation in the areas to prevent the drug from permanently damaging those areas. This is not an off the book treatment, this is actually a recommended process but due to the state of medical care, is not a service offered nor covered by insurance. This would hopefully be a easy system to put into place.\n3. Must be quiet as the system will be used in public chemotherapy spaces and I do not wish to make it so loud that the hospital stops us from using it. I believe the best option on market is aquarium pumps due to their quiet design. \n4. I would love some type of battery system that could support the system for 3-4 hours in case of power outage.\n5. hopefully built around a rolling cooler to aide in transportation. \n\nI am not experienced in this type of stuff at all, I am just in desperate need of advising. This can prevent life long damage to my wife and I need to get it right the first time without leaking water all over the hospital.

        "text": "I have an interesting problem at my plant right now and need sone help understanding what’s happening and how to fix it. \n\nThe problem:\nThere is an elevated platform that supports a motor and gearbox that turns a press roll on a pulp dryer that runs at so many feet per minute (fpm). At a certain range of rates (ex. 300-350fpm) the platform dips in and out of resonance and starts to vibrate, which vibrates the motor and gearbox that it is supporting, or i guess it could be vice versa (motor and gearbox vibrating platform) i’m not entirely sure. \n\nThe issue:\nThe issue with this platform is that the columns that support it are in weird locations (not on corners, some portions of the platform are cantilevered). This is because there is another motor and gearbox on a concrete foundation directly below it that block the best place to add more support. So adding more support to the platform is very tricky. \n\nWhat i’m thinking:\nI know from vibrations that when the operating frequency approaches the natural frequency of the system then you start to experience resonance. So at a certain rate (which the machine usually only stays in for start-up but due to supply issues we are slowed back into this range) the platform and the machine start resonating. So we either change the operating frequency (not really possible due to production limitations) or change the natural frequency. To change the natural frequency we have to make the system stiffer (increase spring constant of the system) by adding more support or change the mass of the platform. The only issue with changing the spring constant is i have no idea how to calculate it and prove that a certain change will stop vibration. I assume that it’s a complex FEA problem that i don’t have the software or knowledge to calculate.\n\nAny help is appreciated, i’m not sure where to go from here, but it’s going to cause an equipment failure if we don’t figure something out soon.",

        "text": "Hello! I am currently working on building a 6X6\" cube freezer. The freezer needs to be almost silent and create as little heat as possible. I have been working with the idea of a Peltier TEC with a copper heatsink and a large computer fan, but it simply can't keep the hot side of the TEC cool enough to find out if the cold side would freeze the space. I need it to get the inside of the cube down to -18C in 15 mins. The freezer part inside will be about 4x4x4\"Does anyone have any other suggestions to cool the TEC down? I don't want to have to cool the TEC using water as that would add too many parts and additional bulk. This will be mounted, so it doesn't have to be portable, but it does need to fit into the 6x6\"cube entirely. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you for reading!",

They planners have just done an Eddy Current test so this was all discovery work, and sadly, a retubing or replacment could not be made in time for this.  \n\n\nWell, not yet my problem as I work in a different unit lol, but I want to use this as a learning opportunity instead and know more about heaters in general, and I have some questions our fellow engineers could offer some insights.  \n\n\n1. I have no idea on the determinations on Eddy Current tests, Is there a standard thickness allowable for feedwater hex? Like maybe a % thinning from its original thickness?\n2. They are contemplating to servicing the hex upon operation until the next outage where we could plan for the materials, since bypassing it might be harmful to the turbine. Will a partial bypass would help (partial opening to heater bypass line) - as it might help with tube velocity? Or maybe no bypass is best? or full bypass?\n3. What does damage in the top-most part of the heater mean? Issues on the extraction steam maybe?\n\nThank you in advance!",
