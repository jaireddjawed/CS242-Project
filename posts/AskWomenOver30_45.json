        "text": "I have two successful and intelligent grown daughters in their 20's, both college grads and starting their careers.\n\nI love them immensely and I feel as if my husband and I raised them well. The younger of the two has seemed (for the last several years) like she prefers her dad to me. She and my husband have a close bond. They are so much alike with common interests- sports, outdoors, camping, scuba diving- just two peas in a pod? But ever since her mid-teens, she and I haven't had that close of a bond. I always thought it was because we are different in personality and interests. My oldest 'takes after me' more and she seems to respect and actually LIKE me as her mom. My younger daughter does not. :( \n\nMy older is a newlywed. She and her new husband live just over an hour away in a city. They both just got new, good jobs in their fields. My younger (single girl) who's passionate about her career field, just got a brand new job in a different region of the US. Both my husband and I are immensely proud of her and wanted her to come home for Christmas, even though it was expensive to travel this time of year. My husband paid for her plane ticket so she could come home for nearly a week.\n\nI say my husband paid- not 'us'- because I don't work a regular job. I do side gigs while trying to sell my published fiction books. He's the primary breadwinner for our household, including our son, a high-school sophomore. I'm basically a SAHM again after losing my job (special education aide) over 2 years ago. \n\nWe have a very traditional, old-fashioned family style with your traditional gender roles. When they were little, I stayed home with them while my husband worked. We had struggled financially during their childhood but now, my husband's business does well and we have a more comfortable living. We helped finance both of their college educations. (even me with my very low paying job when I worked.)\n\nMy younger daughter just left for the airport. When I was in her old bedroom, I asked if there were things she wanted to take with her because we want to clear out her and her sister's bedroom to convert it into a guest room. She began talking to me in a really rude, 'snippy' tone that she always uses toward me- never her dad. She talks to me in a disrespectful, belittling tone of voice. 'I got my stuff already!' Then she said 'Don't wear my clothes!' (meaning her old clothes she isn't taking with her and probably won't ever wear again?) When I said that she wouldn't wear them and I don't even WANT to 'steal' her clothes, she rudely said 'Get out! I'm packing!'\n\nI feel really hurt and disrespected by my own child. Looking back on her growing up years, I can't think of any reason why she would treat me with such scorn while she totally respects Dad. I feel like maybe the reason is because I was always a traditional mom who didn't work while she is a go-getter type, a career woman and maybe she thinks I'm 'below' her now even though I raised her with such love and nurturing. It hurts. I also have sort of a doormat personality, low self-esteem so I've gone years without standing up to her. I tell her it's rude to talk to her mom like that, but she keeps doing it. I've told my husband how I feel and hope he will address it when alone with her.\n\nTL, DR: My adult daughter respects and likes her dad, but she belittles me and acts rude and snippy to me. She has a closer bond with her dad but not with me. :(",

When I say late I’m talking 15 minutes. \n\nWe do work in a hospital, in a procedural area and not the bedside, so her being late does not cause anyone to stay late, nor does it cause a delay in the schedule for the day. She works so hard when she’s here, very smart, knowledgeable and is such a resource for the new staff. Why does her being 15 minutes late regularly warrant her being fired? We do not have enough nurses as is, nor are we able to fill the openings we have. It just makes no sense to me why a department would rather run with all new grads with no experience, rather than retain their experienced staff and overlook a minor thing.\n\nI’m just looking for insight.",

Do you think that this kind of relationship could work? Would others feel bothered by this? \n\nI feel uncomfortable for several reasons. One of these reasons being some of the people that he spends time with, because his friends are quite different to my friends (eg do drugs, date teenagers, hunt for one night stands). He is also surrounded by beautiful women (his friends’ girlfriends and their friends, who are Instagram influencers, heavily cosmetically enhanced curvy girls). I can’t help but feel insecure and down about this because I’m an average looking person. Tbh, I don’t really understand why he’s dating someone like me at all?\n\nHe has told me that girls will approach him and that he will chat with them and won’t mention having a girlfriend during the conversation because “it can make things awkward because no one has asked about partners”. He tells me that I don’t need to worry because he loves me, wants to be with me and knows that he can enforce boundaries if people try to cross it.\n\nWe’ve had many conversations about my concerns but he does not feel that things need to change because he says that the root issue is my insecurity. I know that I’m a very insecure person but I can’t help but constantly feel triggered by this situation. I love him so much.\n\nI would really appreciate feedback and your opinion about this situation, and if you think that something long term could work? Also, if other people would feel bothered by this or if the problem is just me.\n\nI would also like to add that I am not a hater of beautiful people, Instagram influencers, etc, I just feel insecure because I feel like I can’t measure up.",

        "text": "Recently, my therapist broached the concept of me  (F33) having ADHD to me in sessions. I didn't think so at first but, after our most recent conversation, I started looking into it and I think it may be true. I'm looking into getting a full evaluation. \n\nI talked to my parents about it at the start of the holidays and today had a deeper conversation about it with my mom. I mentioned to her that being diagnosed as an adult requires examples from when you were young/under 12. I told her that, given what I remember about my own childhood, I can't believe I wasn't diagnosed as a kid &amp; figured it was a gender bias/WOC issue. She told me they didn't want to say anything because they worried it could result in me being denied life insurance. \n\nI'm not necessarily angry because I know that my immigrant parents thought that was a valid concern. But I am upset because I struggled so much in work, school, with relationships, with mental health. I made it through grad school and have done fairly well but thinking of the ways my life could have been \"smoother\" if I knew earlier really sucks. \n\nAny tips for how to continue to dive into this conversation? I'm feeling so hurt",

For example, I’ll be coming downstairs and he can’t hear that even though his house doesn’t have good insulation, and when I show up in the kitchen where he is, he’s startled. I also think he’s been turning up the volume on the TV a little more than before. I was also trying to talk to him from across the kitchen while he was stir-frying something, which was loud but in the past he’d be able to hear me and now he can’t hear me clearly. \n\nBut he claims his hearing tests come back fine and don’t show hearing loss. I don’t think he’s lying but he gets the testing done in another country and I’m not sure of the quality of those tests. \n\nHow do I convince him that he needs hearing aids? I’ve never brought it up before but I know I’d encounter resistance.  His father (my grandpa) had the same issue and refused hearing aids as well. It’s quite frustrating.

Y’all are always full of helpful advice and I’m in desperate need of it. \n\nI really want to repair my relationship with exercise and movement. While suffering from two eating disorders (in recovery for both yay!), and having a deep seated hatred for my body, I tried the gym a few times and despised it bc it wasn’t fun and I wasn’t seeing immediate “positive” changes to my body. I didn’t want a slow burn, I wanted my body to be “fixed” quickly. I would nearly cry every time I went on the elliptical, and that was basically all I did. I didn’t like the burn, I didn’t like not having an instructor encouraging me, I didn’t like the discomfort working out brought. And the fact that my body didn’t instantly change into what I fantasized about was a big issue, which I know is stupid but I was very unwell. \n\nBut now I’m in a MUCH better place, and I now want to approach exercise and movement with a more open mind and generally less goal-oriented. I want to take care of myself, and I have no interest in losing weight or changing my body outside of what naturally happens sometimes when one works out. However, I’m still scared of the gym and all of the physical an emotional pain it caused and I don’t know how to get started.\n\nI’d honestly rather take dance classes or pilates or something, but there aren’t classes near me. I mostly just have access to gyms, which is why I’m trying to push myself. \n\nHas anyone had similar experiences and have some advice? Or even if you haven’t had the same type of experiences, I’d love any advice on how to get my butt in the gym and feel good about it!\n\nThank you!\n\nP.S. I’m in therapy as well and am working with her on this.",

He has dealt with drug addiction in the past and won't talk to any of his own friends and family except his video game friends. He is starting therapy tomorrow so that's good. \n\nSince getting married I have not been consistently happy and don't know what to do.

        "text": "This is some serious \"poor me\" venting here but I (35f) need to get it out of my system, and I'm sure some of you can relate.\n\nDriving home from Christmas with my parents and our family's best friends, my boyfriend (34m) and love of my life for 4 years, asked me about \"another upcoming wedding in your family?\" that my Dad mentioned to him. Yeah, there is a wedding for one of my cousins in September that I know my parents really want me to attend - even though I barely know this cousin, certainly don't know their partner, and it's an 8 hour drive. There was also a big family announcement on Christmas day when my favourite cousin got engaged to his girlfriend of one year. Celebrations all around, happy things. There's been a few weddings this year, a new new babies in the family. \n\nThen there's me. \n\nI lost both of my younger brothers last year. Almost 2 years later, it's still pretty much the only thing on my mind at any given moment. I have no siblings anymore, my life has been totally and completely shattered. I truly feel like a lost little girl in the world now, looking upon everyone else's big happy families, and completely lamenting my total lack of one. Yes I have my parents and I love them with everything I have, but it's nothing without my brothers. We are mere scraps of ourselves.\n\nAnd when I first got together with my incredible boyfriend, everyone assumed we'd be engaged by Christmas that year. Lord knows, I assumed it. We were so whole-heartedly in love. In that first year, we had already agreed that we were each other's \"the one\" but an engagement didn't come, and fair enough, we didn't live together yet.\n\nWe moved in together after a year of dating, and that was the month COVID started and shut the world down (March 2020). My boyfriend and I both worked at home full time for the following 2.5 years. It was fucking hard on us. We felt many times that we had been robbed of the experience of moving in together for the first time. Everything was tainted with anxiety, doom and gloom, and far too much \"togetherness\" in a heated situation. We loved living together, but it was tough.\n\nThen my brothers died. Until the day I got the call, I thought my boyfriend and I were on the cusp of engagement, and the start of our real lives together. Again, so completely in love. Things felt whole. Then my whole entire fucking world fell apart. \n\nAnd now I'm not celebrating, simply bearing wedding after engagement after new baby after life celebrations of my extended family, and nothing for me. Nothing of my own. I got to go to a 4 person funeral last year for my only two siblings and both of my grandparents. No wedding for me, no baby I want so fucking bad. Just utter devastation.\n\nAnd I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. \n\nWhen he asked me about that upcoming wedding, I just said \"I'm not going to any further weddings that isn't my own wedding. I am done celebrating other people's happiness when there's nothing for *me.*\"\n\nHe didn't respond to that, and I don't blame him, but I really hope the point has been made. I recently made it very clear to him that I am sick of waiting - I am 35, I want a child, I want something happy in my life, and if he isn't going to do it, then he needs to leave so I can find it. And it hurts so much to say that, because I only want him. He's my fucking soul mate. During that particular convo, he said something about how earlier that night he had been \"thinking about what my vows would be,\" and yet he still hasn't engaged me? He said something about how he doesn't want to feel forced into it - but what's the fucking wait?\n\nI love him so much and we are so beyond happy together. We have built ourselves a lovely life and every plan of ours is a plan together. I know that his older sister is getting married next year (she's just a year older than me) and perhaps that's what he's waiting for (and I'm certain of that), but I'm really not emotionally able to wait much longer. I know everyone in my life is wondering why we aren't married already, let alone not engaged. And I'm wondering too. If he really loves me and wants to be with me, how can we keep waiting when we know it's going to be us forever? \n\nI can't keep celebrating everyone else when I want the celebration for myself. I want something good to happen to *me*. And right now, I honestly feel like going upstairs and crying to him and giving him a damn ultimatum, because I just feel so fucking sad. Everything bad happens to me while everyone else gets everything I ever wanted. All I ever get in life is \"I'm so sorry\" instead of \"congratulations!\"\n\nI want a congratulations. I want all of my loved ones around to celebrate the love I share with this man. I want to be special for once for something *good*, not completely life-altering and devastating.\n\nAnd until it happens, I will not attend a wedding or baby shower. Nothing if it's not for me. I don't care who it is. I don't care if that's selfish. I don't feel bad. I just can't do it anymore.",

Observing and uncovering and frankly exposing myself to a whole new one is well, a little triggering, a lot scary, and ultimately draining as hell. \n\nWho can relate?! What advice do you have?",

He was arrested but because I minimized the abuse, he was only charged with misdemeanors.  After lots of therapy and accepting that the abuse wasn't my fault, I wish I hadn't minimized so he could've been charged appropriately (please dont judge me for this)\n\n I recently met a guy who  started as a hook up but we've become pretty good friends. He told me he has feelings for me which I didn't reciprocate so we decided to stay friends. \n\nA few days ago, he said this about my ex “He’s such an idiot. If he did what the court said, he'd be fine. They were just misdemeanors anyway.” Firstly, I told him about the abuse but I never told him the charges. He admitted he went through my Instagram to find his last name and looked up court records. Second, calling five years of abuse “just misdemeanors” is probably the most invalidating thing a friend has ever said to me. Not to sound dramatic but it felt retraumatizing. I keep repeating “Just misdemeanors” and literally have flashbacks of my ex taunting me that I'm crazy and making a big deal out of nothing. \n\nI feel like the mature thing to do is talk to him and explain why that comment hurt but I feel so... violated. Is it really so unreasonable to expect a friend doesn't say shit like this? Why is the burden to explain *always* on me*?* Why do I have to explain how fucked up the justice system is? Oh and now I have this new fear that if I share my abuse with a partner in the future, he will have the same reaction, which kind of really really breaks my heart. \n\nI just want to block him and never speak to him again with no explanation but I worry I'm just triggered and not thinking rationally.",

And started having children shortly thereafter they're all in their upper 40s now some of them even have children older than me. I'm the baby of the family I'm 26M I came along as a surprise. \n\nEvery holiday it seems like or my birthday frankly almost any time I talk to them I get the dreaded when are you going to get married when are you going to have kids. Are you seeing anybody?\n\nI'm in a unique situation because I've had a few long-term relationships I just don't disclose them to my family. I date significantly older women and I know they would sincerely take issue with that. They wouldn't understand that there is an ability for people with significant age gaps to love each whether they would just see it as a sexual taboo and not necessarily for the real purpose of it being about an emotional and intellectual Bond.\n\nHonestly children aren't really a priority for me it's not something I aspire to. I don't subscribe to this ideal of a nuclear family of oh my God I have to be married and pop out children to have value in my life.\n\n\nI hinted that I really don't want children I haven't right out said no I'm never going to have mostly say something along the lines of oh I'm not ready for kids or well maybe I'll find somebody. So like should I just disclose to my family it's not going to happen and move on from there or keep them in the dark?\n\nWould like to hear from religious women mostly because I think their input best reflects the mindset of my family.",

        "text": "There is something I have been curious about. Take anyone who marries for the first time. What are the chances from that point on that said person will have sex with someone other than their spouse at least once? All the variables involved would include those who eventually divorce, separate, commit infidelity, perform consensual non-monogamy, lose a spouse to death, and mental health issues. Any other variables that would fit? Maybe look at different generations, as well. Add up all of those that are mutually exclusive, and what do the numbers add up to?\n\nWithout so much of a deep dive into the numbers, a quick assumption would be: Divorce- ~40% for first time marriages. This is likely more related to the baby boomer generation. For the millennial generation, currently less than 40%. Maybe 25%. This will increase as millennials age. Separation- ~5-10%. Infidelity- Oof. Numbers are all over the place. Given I am looking at those who only commit infidelity, but do not divorce or separate, I would guess the number is smaller. Maybe 5%, at most. Consensual non-monogamy- 5% currently perform, around 20% have attempted. Exclusive to itself, I would guess around 5% at most. Death of spouse, mental illness, etc- 5%? This is more for the baby boomer generation, likely. My generation, millennials, would have lower rates of divorce, separation and infidelity, but higher rates of CNM. All of those rates will increase as we age, as well.\n\nThere will be a number who divorce, separate, perform CNM or lose a spouse to death that do not have sex with other people.\n\nMy guess is that, for any generation, at least a little over half of those who marry for the first time will eventually have sex with someone other than their spouse at least once. At most, 80%. So...55%-75%. Large range, but, there aren't really any studies I have found that specifically look into this. That's just my number, though. I want to know other's thoughts on this.\n\nFor reference, I am an unmarried aspie man with a science and analytical background who just enjoys studying up on romantic structures :).",

I fled to a hotel after a particularly awful argument and he followed me in a car, it was dangerous. I left him in 2020 but he persuaded me to take him back a few months later as he had extensive daily therapy to treat his OCD. My Mum got ill from cancer and died in November last year at her home. He was supportive through all of that while I helped care for her. \n\nI have truly seen a change in him but I don't feel the same way. I am repulsed by his touch. I've decided I need to leave but I'm having strong self-doubt.\n\nI have only two friends who live abroad. All our socialising for 12 years has been with his friends. I never made effort to make any while I battled with depression. We live 2 minutes walk from his parents in an isolated rural area who are very wealthy. I spent Christmas with them and they showered me with gifts and it was overwhelming. I sound ungrateful but they do nothing for charity and are greedy and materialistic. They don't give a shit about the environment when I'm an environmental worker. Generate a tonne of personal waste and fly all the time and never walk anywhere and always drive even to restaurants like 10 minutes from their house (this is more weird in the UK than US). If we go out for a meal all they do is bitch about the service. They never ask much about me and his Dad makes weird bullying jokes about people that aren't funny. They have low class tbh sort of never grew out of 80s yuppiedom.  \n\nSome suffice to say I find their values difficult and I'm suffocated by the codependent relationship my partner has with them. He sees them everyday though they often bicker together everytime. It's just a weird atmosphere. One of the main reasons I want to leave is because of his parents. I couldn't bear the thought of having to help look after them in their old age as I don't like them. But I know my partner would leave room for nothing else if they got ill. \n\nI've had an offer accepted on a house (my partner owns our house) and I do work so can afford to leave. But I'm so terrified of being alone. I wanted kids but accept now that's unlikely so I avoid people my age with young happy families as it is triggering. I think I could still be happy though as I fantasise about healing my mind and body and having plastic free house etc etc. But I'm so worried about being completely alone and getting ill and having no one who cares. \n\nWhen I was younger I was a lot braver, even did a research project alone leading staff in Indonesia. Now I'm such a pussy. I just wish I had some faith it will be ok.",

I have a reputation for being professional, responsible, quick at learning, and driven, so bosses and colleagues mostly liked me. My big break came when a charismatic high flyer in his mid-30s joined the department, and poached me into his team for my work ethic. He drove me hard, and we produced stellar work, and got to work on big projects. We had great camaraderie. My team and I loved him for his charisma, and how he got the team together. Because I was the youngest in the team, he seemed to take better care of me.  He took especial interest in our work and personal lives, and coached us to live up to potential. Colleague’s marriage falling apart – he was there to offer support; colleague needed time to take care of kids – he was understanding; I was unsure of how to do my work – he stayed back after work to coach me. Whenever he went out with other colleagues for after work drinks and get togethers, he made sure to bring me along. Being young and new to the workforce, I saw him being a role model I looked up to. \n\nAs I grew up in the workplace though, I noticed something more sinister. He seemed to like to play us off each other, such that we’d blame each other for faults, but all love him. I realized only when my colleague and I corroborated our stories with each other, and found that he had trashed the other person with one of us. The first time I confronted him about something he’d said about me, he apologized, then said he’d never do it again. But we loved him anyway. We often worked together till late at night on projects to rush deadlines, and I sometimes wondered how I’d feel as his wife (whom he usually left at home to hang out with us, or work with us), but I put it behind me, thinking that this was the military life anyway. I always toed a professional line with him and made sure he knew I saw him as a role model, and at best, a big brother.\n\nWe worked together for five years. When he got promoted and left the team, we were devastated. But he continued to ask each of us out individually one by one, to catch up. He also texted me almost daily to ask for updates about my life. He was more friendly, and got much more personal. He’d ask me out each weekend. I was going through a huge crisis at work, so he became a pillar of support, dispensing work and life advice, and being there. I thanked him for being a dependable big brother. He started to whisk me away to stay out later and later at night, and trying to persuade me to ditch my parents (who always called me around midnight to demand my whereabouts). I told him that my parents were just concerned, and then said I couldn’t stay out that late anymore. He then tried to teach me tricks to get my parents to be accustomed to staying out with him. When I went on vacation, he texted me daily for updates. And when he went on one with his wife, he asked after me and sent me updates daily. Looking back, I definitely felt uncomfortable. I began asking after his wife every time we met up, and also reminded him during vacation of spending more romantic alone time with her. I began thinking that our relationship was weird. \n\nBut it didn’t strike me till recently. I told him I was changing jobs and quitting the military. He got very angry at me, vilifying my character, discouraging me from shifting out, demeaning my skills, challenging my assumption that the next workplace would be better. It was harsh, bordering abusive. And he glared at me the entire time. We were in a public restaurant, and the whole thing was so utterly unexpected and mean, I started tearing up halfway. He left in a huff. I was left shaken. My friends had all been so happy for me on this job shift. He was the one I’d been counting on to be happiest, but his response had been totally unexpected - neither supportive, nor kind. \n\nI pondered over whether he was in a bad mood and happened to take it out on me, but didn't find it right. And as I came home to think about it, the behaviour seemed borderline controlling, almost possessive. I wondered if he was angry I was about to slip out of his grasp if I was no longer in the military. Now I want to put distance between us, but am afraid he might sabotage my next work opportunity (he knows who the employer and supervisors are because I revealed them.). What else can I do to better protect myself? Did I read this situation wrong? What type of behaviour is this even? Any advice would be appreciated.",

For instance if I say I'm feeling bad he'll say \"if it makes you feel better I'm feeling awesome\". And last night his godparents were showing us pics of their flooded/destroyed house from hurricane Ian. And while he said that sucks he also told them we spent the hurricane at our house (2 hrs away) and were disappointed by how tame it was. I'm not sure if these are supposed to be jokes. Or if he just doesn't know how to empathize. \n\nHis parents tell me I've help their son \"open up\" And that he's been way less distant since we've been together. His dad often says \"I saved\" his son. But I feel like he's still plenty closed off and aloof? \n\nLike we've been trying to get pregnant for almost a year and it's one of the hardest things I've been through. We've had 2 early losses and I get down whenever my cycle starts and have a lot of anxiety leading up to it. I've had a direct convo with him 2 cycles ago -- I cried (which I don't do often) and said I need more emotional support. He said he understood. Okay cool. Fast forward to the next cycle, I tell him I'm not pregnant (via text since he was out playing golf) and when he gets home he gives zero mention of it, no hug, no anything. And he's surprised I didn't want me to go with him to a family gift exchange that same day. He leaves for the event just completely aloof? I stay home and basically cry all day feeling so alone (we haven't shared with anyone our struggles to conceive). I had another conversation with him. And he's surprised I'm upset? He said he was disappointed we weren't pregnant but he guesses he's just more optimistic than me?\n\nTldr; My fiancé is not great at providing emotional support to others. And my question is it fair to want him to change? Or should I accept this is just who he is?",

        "text": "I (40F) am on vacation with my family - husband and kids - on a tropical island. It was very nice, until Day 3 when we spent the afternoon at the beach. I was so intimidated and self-conscious in my bikini that I couldn't stop comparing myself to all these women in thong bikinis with perfect bodies and what seemed like 0% cellulite and no body fat. Some of them look like they don't even work out - they are just naturally skinny and cellulite-free.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I was anorexic. I was a ballet dancer. I ran 3 miles every morning, danced 2 hours a day, and hit the gym at night. I looked amazing. I had walked this same beach 20 years ago in my bikini and felt like a rock star. But it wasn't healthy or sustainable.\n\nNow, 20 years later, after multiple kids, I have cellulite on my thighs. My ass is flabbier than I want. I have always been pear-shaped, but I could hide it well back then, with all of my exercise, high heels, and protein-bar diet. I loved how I looked. But I knew it wasn't sustainable. I knew I couldn't eat this way with kids. I didn't want my children seeing their mom starving herself and working out like a maniac. Plus, the guys I met when I looked this way weren't great. I hated dating gym bros who were even more vain than I was.\n\nIt took a year, but I recovered from anorexia and quit ballet. Due to years of joint stress, I now have bad hips and knees and can no longer run. I later met my husband who doesn't give a damn what anyone looks like. He fell in love with me after I had gained ten pounds.\n\nI am now 125lbs at 5'4\" and look pretty good except for the cellulite. I couldn't work out for two years due to a severe medical issue, but now I'm back and workout 30 mins a day on the elliptical plus I lift weights. I like my shape overall, except for the cellulite and leg and ass fat.\n\nBut damn if I couldn't shake my insecurities on this vacation. I thought I was over this, but those demons came right back into my head the moment I saw my legs compared to the other beautiful beach bodies out there. My husband says I'm still super sexy and yes I am actually in better shape than when I met him (although with more cellulite). \n\nI want the beach to be a place where everyone feels comfortable, no matter their body type. So why can't I extend this same grace to myself? Who am I trying to impress? Random strangers, I guess? Other women? I'm not trying to pick up men. When I was younger, I thrived off the compliments of strangers. People stopped me in the street to tell me how amazing I looked. I miss that. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or words of encouragement I'd love to hear it. Thanks y'all.",

My mom wanted to do hot chocolate so I brought some with me, but she didn’t want any after all. I’m not mad at her, but what was the point? My parents chain-smoke inside the house making it unbearable to stay. My sister moved away and has started her own family and will never come home to visit. All grandparents are deceased. I have cousins on both sides, but both of my parents never made any effort to celebrate anything with them my whole life. They just sit there day in and day out. \n\nI’m talking to a few men right now and while I’m not devastated about my lack of family closeness, they just seem spooked or sad for me that I don’t travel to see family, have no family parties, have no traditions, etc. I am a little envious that they all have parents that have made efforts to bring family together and have fun. Although I consider myself a well-rounded and interesting person without a big family, sometimes I fear that it just makes me seem lonely or less desirable. Like I come from a broken home or am damaged somehow. I’m 33, there’s nothing I can really do about this. \n\nDoes anyone else under where I am coming from?",

        "text": "\n\nMet a guy off a dating app in 2020. I realized he was playing me because he was still talking to other people even though he asked me to be his gf. Instead of leaving the relationship I continued &amp; we had sex then after about a month he dumped me after valentines day.  I cried and tried to get over it. Started a new relationship and a year later he messaged me on facebook. I tried to ignore it and move on but i realized I still wanted him. I broke off the relationship I had to be with him. \n\n He ended up pushing me for raw sex and anal &amp; for a long time I said no. I just wanted to be responsible and use protection. He kept pushing. He me to be in a relationship with him and we started going out on dates. I caved yesterday and now hes telling me \" I just see us as friends and I dont want to rush into anything\".\n\nIm crying rn I just feel so bad and stupid. I know people say learn from your mistakes but I just feel so empty inside wondering what I did to deserve this",
