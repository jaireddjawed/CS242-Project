        "text": "My eyes were burning. I’d been reading stories online for an entire day without breaks. NoSleep had always been my favorite subreddit, but it wasn’t until I discovered flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   that it turned into an obsession.\n\nTheir writing transcended the screen. I was transported into nightmarish worlds with intricate plots, unique characters, and endings I never saw coming. Hours would pass by in the blink of an eye and their catalog seemed endless. They were a truly prolific author with thousands of stories to choose from.\n\nDespite the undeniable greatness, their stories never got more than a single upvote or comment -- other than my own. flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   replied every time without fail. Sometimes within seconds, but no longer than a minute. Even their comments were long, well-thought-out diatribes I'd get lost in.\n\nAfter my initial binge, I awoke on my keyboard the next day, a dribble of spit pooling on the 'esc' key. I went right back to reading and called in sick to work. Nothing else mattered other than the next story.\n\n*Just one more* I'd tell myself, only to find that another day had passed. Then the days turned into weeks. The outside world slipped away and the only thing that mattered were flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   stories. It felt like they were written just for me. \n\nLike an apostle, I was driven to spread the gospel. It wasn't enough that I was transfixed by flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   writing -- others had to be as well. In between hours-long reading sessions, I began posting about flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   everywhere I could. That's when the strangeness began.\n\n“You posted a dead link.\"\n\n\"Who is this author you're talking about? I can’t find their stories anywhere. They don’t exist.\"\n\n\"It seems like you're trying to tag someone, but there’s nothing there.”\n\nNo matter how hard I tried no one else could access the stories. It made no sense. I wondered if flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   had been blacklisted or shadow banned, but then why was I able to read them? \n\nI decided to try a different tactic. My college roommate, Sean, was in town and I invited him over. He'd been trying to get ahold of me for months, so he accepted without hesitation. Within hours I’ve my invitation I hear a knock at my front door.\n\nWhen he arrived I could tell he was concerned. My hair was disheveled, large bags sat under my eyes, I'd lost a lot of weight, and I'm sure I smelled terrible. Before he could say a word, I rushed him toward my computer.\n\n\"Bro, you gotta check flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   stories out. They will change your life.\" I squealed excitedly as I opened up my laptop.\n\n\"Ummm, whose stories? You mumbled that part.\" He seemed very unsure.\n\n\"flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞ \" I repeated again\n\n\"I have no idea what you're trying to say.\" He replied\n\n\"flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞ !\" I shouted in response.\n\n\"Why don't you just show me the story. Then we need to talk. I'm worried about you bud.\"\n\nI pulled up flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   lastest post, but Sean looked on with an empty stare.\n\n\"The screen's blank. What am I supposed to be seeing?”\n\n\"Very funny. I promise we can talk if you just read it.\"\n\n\"I'm not joking. There's nothing there.\"\n\nI tried another story, and then another. Each time the same response. Finally, it seemed to get through. \n\n“Hold on, something’s happening,” he sounded suddenly distant, “Oh god. What is this? I’m going to be sick!”\n\nSean rushed to the bathroom and retched. He began coughing so hard I thought he’d thrown up a lung. Then, he grew quiet. My house filled with oppressive silence. \n\n“Sean?” I yelled listlessly. “Was the story that scary? You gonna be ok?” \n\nThere was no response. Annoyed that I had to take a break from my stories, I huffed my way to the bathroom. \n\n“I’m coming in.” \n\nThe bathroom was empty. There was no sign of Sean. We were on the third floor, so he couldn’t have climbed out the window. Confused, I slipped my phone out of my pocket and went to dial his number — but I couldn’t. \n\nSean's contact information, texts, and calls had disappeared. I tried to send him a message through social media, but when I searched for him online, there was no trace. It was as if he never existed in the first place. I couldn’t even picture his face, the memories slowly fading.\n\nAn alert rang on my phone. I had a notification from Reddit. It was a message from flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞ . My heart fluttered with excitement, all thoughts of Sean now completely driven from my mind. \n\n“They can’t see what they don’t understand. My writing is only for those special enough to comprehend. Keep reading. I beg of you. It’s the only thing keeping me going.” \n\nLike a loyal soldier, I obeyed. The next story I read was oddly familiar. It was about a young man who was cursed and befell an awful fate. Banished to an endless void, he wandered through the darkness screaming for help. There was no ending, no real plot, just pages of rambling dialogue from the protagonist before abruptly stopping. The last words were, “The devils puppets can’t see the strings until the show has already ended.” \n\nThose words struck a chord deep in my soul. I reached for their meaning, but they were too distant for me to grasp. It felt like an itch i desperately wanted to scratch, but my efforts were futile. \n\nI tried to read more stories, but the spark had suddenly dimmed. I found flk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞   writing boring. When I went back and read previous posts, I couldn’t understand what had driven my obsession. The stories were shallow, flat, and poorly written. Nothing about them brought me joy. \n\nAnnoyed and suddenly inspired, I began to write my own stories. For a month straight, I posted multiple stories a day across different accounts. No matter how much effort I put into them, they received no attention. Not a single like, comment, or mention. \n\nAt some point, I realized I hadn’t left my house since I started writing. In fact, I couldn’t recall doing anything but writing — not even the basics like sleeping, eating, and drinking. \n\nI stood up from my chair to go to the kitchen, but there was no door to leave my bedroom. The windows were gone too. All around me were grayish walls void of decoration, like a prison cell with no bars. I screamed, but no sound came. Even the voice inside my head was nothing but a whisper. \n\nAs the existential dread washed over me, a message notification from Reddit flashed on my screen.\n\n“Im finally free. Sorry, but you’re next.”\n\nflk͏̷f̀j̸̧͠l̨a͞͞dk͏҉́f̶͘j̴̀l̶e͘͝įi͡e͡҉͞ profile disappeared. I watched as the posts disintegrated — literally. They floated through my room like tufts of ash and disappeared into the darkness. \n\nThat was seven years ago. I’ve been posting every day since. Stuck in this room, my keyboard stained with blood. \n\nIf you’re reading this, It’s too late for you now. There’s no escape. \n\nYou’re next.",

        "text": "(Part one will be linked in the comments)Yes I am alive and I am going to update with what is currently going on. In my last post I mentioned that I was last stuck in my bedroom with my “husband” cooking and singing. I planned to escape and go to my work (even though it was my day off) to check for details regarding our new “home”. After I posted my story I sat in bed listening to my “husband” sing a melody that made me even more uneasy. I eventually got up the courage to leave the bed, I put on some clothes trying to be quiet hoping he wouldn't hear me.\n“Honey?” he called in a sweet voice, I cursed myself.\n“Mhm yes dear?” I slid on some of my old tennis shoes that I happened to luckily still be packed in a box.\n“You should sleep in a bit more! I think some extra sleep will help clear your head.” He hummed, “I just want what is best for you.”\nI hated this, I felt so defenseless, a part of me wants to believe that Larry is still Larry and I'm just making this up. But I'm not and that message I wrote to myself proves it. That thing continued to hum.\n“I..I think some fresh air would help me.” I said my voice squeaking. \nThe humming stopped, and a long silence filled the air. I felt my heart pounding as I slowly made my way out of our room. The house creaked and I felt as if something was watching me while I slowly made my way to the entryway. I had to pass by the kitchen in order to get to the entry and I held my breath as I made it closer and closer. The silence was still there and all I could hear was my heart which felt as if it was about to explode. As I passed the kitchen I realized it was empty. So where was he..it? I turned and found Larry standing by our shoe rack in the entryway.\n“Honey? What are you?” I mumbled glancing at his hands which were still covered with gloves.\n“You are right, fresh air does sound nice.” He smiled a smile I now hated, “But I don’t want to leave you alone, what if you pass out again, so I thought I'd join you!”\nMy stomach was churning and I thought I was going to be sick. I did not want to take a walk with this thing.\n“I would actually..um” I was stuttering and the air seemed to chill. “ I was thinking of going alone, you know, to clear my head. You see I've been um having ....” I was rambling again.\n Larry took a step closer to me and put his hand on my shoulder. It was ice cold, which was terrifying that I could feel it through the gloves. I felt goosebumps all over my body.\n“Honey, I really” his hand gripped my shoulder harder “don't think that's a good idea.”\nI was just standing there like a mouse stuck in a trap, but really what could I do? \n“O..okay..” I tried to plaster a smile, “Let me get my sweater and you can clean up whatever you were cooking earlier. We can eat it when we get back.”\nThe thing paused, looking me up and down, I felt like he was seeing right through me.\nThen he grinned as big toothy smile, “Alright, why don’t you get my coat too.”\n“A..alright.” I turned around and began walking back towards our bedroom.\nIt was hard to not run, I wanted to leave as soon as possible, but I was patient and walked. I still felt as if something was watching me, observing my every move. Well eventually I made it to our bedroom, and I grabbed my coat, wallet and car keys. Then I went to our bedroom window, opened it as quietly as I could, and climbed out. I ran as fast as I could towards my car. I didn’t know where he was in my house and if he was still by the entryway, so my only hope was that he actually went back to the kitchen. I made it to my car, and that thing was nowhere near my car.\n I started it up and backed out of the driveway, that's when I saw him staring out of a window directly at me. If that wasn’t unnerving enough he was grinning ear from ear, a big toothy smile I hated. Why? Why was he smiling? He must've known that I didn’t plan to come back. So why did he look like that? I drove out of the neighborhood and I heard a ding on my phone. My heart was pounding again, the message must be from him. I didn’t want to view it, I was terrified of what it might say. I drove to a gas station near my work so I could look at my phone. I was right, it was a text from that thing, my “husband” “Drive safe see you soon.” I feel as if I am going to puke, what does he mean see you soon? I have so many questions, what is it planning? I decided to go to a hotel instead of straight to work, so I could clear my head. So I drove, checked into a room and took the rest of that day to think about what I'd do next. I am typing this in a hotel room, I plan to go to work today and view some old newspapers. Hopefully I'll find some of my creepy house and it's past residents. I also want to thank the person who commented. Although I don’t plan to burn my house down I will not be returning alone. I don’t really have a plan on what to do after going to work. I might go see my parents, but then again they have no reason to believe me. I’m also looking into priests and exorcisms. I'll update again soon, again any advice is welcomed.",

        "text": "When I was six, my best friend lived in my closet. His name was Mr. Pip. I know what you’re probably thinking: you were just a kid with an overactive imagination, right? Wrong.\n\nI used to be obsessed with a TV show called *Little Annie’s Amazing Adventure.* Don’t bother looking it up. I haven’t been able to find anything about it online. It’s as if it never existed.\n\nThe show always opened with Annie alone in her room. She would look directly into the camera, smile feverishly, then mischievously beckon the viewer to follow her. Next, she’d saunter up to her closet door, knock three times, and the door would swing open, revealing a whimsical world filled to the brim with vibrantly multicolored landscapes and an abundance of wacky cartoon-like characters. My favorite of which was Mr. Pip.\n\nMr. Pip would accompany Annie on all her wild escapades, animatedly overreacting to every strange situation the characters found themselves in. Mr. Pip was a clown dressed in a polka dot jumpsuit with oversized floppy shoes and a bright red wig surmounting his head. I loved watching the pair bounce along on their journey as purple grass swayed atop rolling hills and birds floated through a milky yellow sky.\n\nI remember the exact moment I met Mr. Pip. My mother had grounded me and sent me to my room without supper. She’d received a call from the principal that day detailing how I’d stomped Jimmy Hoskin’s crayons to smithereens completely unprovoked. He’d wiped a booger on me at lunch. He deserved it.\n\nI was throwing a temper tantrum, wailing as loudly as my little vocal cords could muster so my mother would understand exactly how upset I was. Once I’d nearly screamed my lungs out, I settled down, my cries devolving into whimpering sniffles. That’s when I heard it. Three faint knocks from inside my closet. I fell silent.\n\nI strained my ears, listening intently for any further disturbances. It happened again. Three soft knocks emanated from my closet door. I hesitantly crept up to it and returned the gesture. *Knock. Knock. Knock.*\n\n“Hello there, Michael!”\n\nI leapt back, stifling a scream. My head started to spin, and my palms began to sweat.\n\n“W-who are you?” I demanded, delivering my best tough guy impression.\n\n“You know me, Michael. I’m your friend, Mr. Pip,” the voice sang in that same high-pitched tone I’d grown so accustomed to hearing.\n\n“How do I know it’s really you?”\n\n“Would Mr. Pip lie to you?”\n\n“Well… no.”\n\n“That’s right, Michael! Mr. Pip would *never* lie to you.”\n\n“Mr. Pip, can I ask you something?”\n\n“Sure! Mr. Pip loves questions!”\n\n“Why are you in my closet?”\n\nHe paused at that. I began to wonder if I’d overstepped. But after a brief period of tense silence, he responded.\n\n“Because I live here, Michael. Your closet is my home.”\n\n“So you… live with me?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Pip lives with *you* now! Mr. Pip could’ve lived with any little girl or boy he wanted, but he chose you, Michael. Aren’t you excited?”\n\n“Yes, yes, I’m so happy!” I yelled. The realization that my favorite TV show character was going to be living in my room finally dawned on me and I bounced up and down like a jackrabbit.\n\n“Good, good. Mr. Pip is happy too!”\n\nI reached for the door and began to pull it open.\n\n“Let’s play, Mr. Pip! Is Annie going-”\n\nThe door slammed shut abruptly.\n\n“NO!” Mr. Pip bellowed in a menacing inflection that sent ice running through my veins. Hot tears welled in my eyes, and I started crying once more.\n\n“Please don’t cry, Michael. Mr. Pip is sorry he scared you,” he apologized deflatedly.\n\n“W-why can’t I play with you?” I blubbered, snot dripping from my nose.\n\n“Because this is Mr. Pip’s home. Mr. Pip isn’t ready for visitors yet.”\n\n“Okay,” I mumbled dejectedly.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Pip knows what will cheer you up! A game!”\n\n“What kind of game?”\n\n“The question game! We’ll take turns asking questions and if you get them right you get a point!” Mr. Pip chirped, seemingly back to his cheery old self.\n\n“Okay! I bet I’m gonna win!”\n\nMr. Pip wasn’t very good at the question game. We played for hours, and he didn’t guess a single answer right. Mr. Pip wanted to know a lot about my house and my family. He even guessed that my dad left for work at midnight! He always left at eight o’clock. What a silly goose!\n\nWe played until it was time for me to go to bed. I drifted off to a blissful slumber, elated that I now had my new best friend to keep me company.\n\n“Michael, time to get ready for school!” Mom shouted, shaking me awake.\n\n“Ugh, I’m up,” I groaned, lazily rubbing the sleep from my eyes.\n\nMom strode over to my closet door to get me dressed and ready for the day. A wave of panic jolted through me like a lightning bolt.\n\n“No, Mom, you can’t go in the closet, that’s where Mr. Pip lives!” I pleaded, begging her not to disturb my friend’s sanctum.\n\n“Michael, all your clothes are in there. I don’t think Mr. Pip will mind if I grab a shirt out of here real quick.”\n\n“NO!”\n\nMy mother completely disregarded my cries. She flung the door open and… nothing.\n\n“See? There’s no one here. Now go brush your teeth please.”\n\nI begrudgingly obeyed, shooting Mom a vexed glance while her back was turned. I spent the remainder of the morning stewing at the thought that my mother had scared Mr. Pip away. I remained recalcitrant throughout the school day, earning me a conduct mark from Mrs. McLemore. Once I returned from school, I slung my backpack onto the floor and made a beeline for my room.\n\n“How was your day kiddo?” Dad inquired with his eyes glued to his newspaper.\n\n“Good.”\n\nI locked myself in my room, itching to know if Mr. Pip was still there. I sidled up to my closet door and knocked. Then I waited. And waited. Maybe he hadn’t heard me? I tried again. Nothing.\n\nOnce it became evident that my raps would go unanswered, I plopped down onto my bed and buried my face in my pillow. Tears began spilling from my eyes. Then I heard it. *Knock. Knock. Knock.*\n\nI bolted out of bed and raced to the door, barely able to contain my jubilation. I hurriedly knocked again.\n\n“Hello, Michael!”\n\n“Mr. Pip! I thought you moved away because Mom came into my closet.”\n\n“Oh no, Michael, Mr. Pip will never leave you!”\n\n“Yay! Why couldn’t Mom see you though?”\n\n“Mr. Pip went deep into your closet so your mommy wouldn’t find him. Mr. Pip didn’t want to scare her.”\n\n“Oh, I get it. Can I come in and play yet?”\n\nHe paused for a long moment.\n\n“Let’s play another game! I’ll make an animal noise and you guess what it is!”\n\n“Oh, I’m good at this game! Let’s play!”\n\nMr. Pip and I played until I was again lulled into a peaceful sleep. Things went on like that for months. Every day I’d eagerly rush to my room to tell Mr. Pip all about my day.\n\nMy parents never understood Mr. Pip like I did. In their minds, he was just a figment of my imagination. A coping mechanism for all the kids who picked on me at school. One night, I overheard them talking about it.\n\n“Daniel, I got another call from his teacher today. His grades are slipping again. You need to have a talk with him about this imaginary friend. He won’t leave his room anymore, and when he does, he’s not focusing on his schoolwork.”\n\nMy father sighed.\n\n“I know, honey. I just thought that maybe if we gave him a little space, this whole thing would work itself out.”\n\n“Well, it’s not. Do you think he’s being bullied at school? I mean, he used to be so active and now he just shuts himself in his room all day.”\n\n“It’s a possibility. Let me talk to him and try to figure out what’s going on. Then we can decide what we need to do.”\n\nI heard my father rise from his chair and begin making his way to my room. I flew back to my bed and braced myself for the uncomfortable discussion that I knew was coming.\n\nMy father knocked on the door.\n\n“Hey buddy, mind if I come in?”\n\n“Okay,” I murmured, hoping I could brush off Dad’s questions so that he’d leave me alone.\n\nHe sat down beside me on the bed and rested a hand on my shoulder.\n\n“Michael, is everything okay? You know, with school and stuff? You’ve been spending a lot of time in here lately, and your mother and I are getting concerned.”\n\n“Yeah, everything’s fine Dad, I just want to play with Mr. Pip is all.”\n\n“Buddy, I know this is going to sound harsh, and I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, but Mr. Pip isn’t real. You need to start making friends your own age.”\n\nI balled my fists as anger rose to the forefront of my emotions. Dad just didn’t get it. He didn’t know Mr. Pip like I did.\n\n“Mr. Pip *is* real! He’s my best friend. I talk to him every day!”\n\n“I didn’t want to have to do this, kiddo, but I’m going to have to show you that Mr. Pip is made up.”\n\nHe marched over to my closet and reached for the handle. The door swung open before he had a chance to grab it.\n\n“Hello there, Daniel!”\n\nDad released a horrifying guttural shriek. There before him stood Mr. Pip.\n\nHe looked nothing like he did on TV. Bright scraggly red hairs sprouted from his head, dotting his scalp in ugly uneven patches. His makeup hadn’t been redone in some time, cracks spider webbing along the caked-on face paint. Mascara flowed from his eyes in dark jet-black streaks, giving the illusion that he’d been crying toxic sludge. His polka dot suit was filthy, and deep lacerations were clearly visible through his tattered clothes. And that smile. Mr. Pip beamed at my father, showcasing rows upon rows of jagged pointed teeth. His crooked grin stretched impossibly wide, yellow teeth glimmering like miniature kitchen knives.\n\nDad stared in awestruck terror for only a second before scooping me up and racing out the door. I stole a glance at Mr. Pip, trembling uncontrollably as I fought back bile. His eyes locked with mine, that vile smirk unwavering.\n\n“You haven’t seen the last of me, Michael! And next time, we'll play a game that’ll really get your blood pumping!”\n\nHis demented cackles reverberated through the halls, sending chills through my soul as my closet door slowly creaked shut.\n\nWe moved shortly afterward. My parents called the cops, but a thorough search of our home revealed nothing out of the ordinary. We bounced around between cheap motels for months until we managed to find our current house.\n\nAs time dragged on, my memories of Mr. Pip began to fade. Eventually, I made friends and I recently started middle school. But tonight, all that prior dread came crashing down on me like a tidal wave. Because as I was writing this, three soft knocks drifted from my closet.",

        "text": "Another long ride home, I thought, watching the subway train arrive. My newspaper still in hand, I got on the railroad car, exhausted after a long working day.\n\nBoarding a train at 10 pm then counting six stations before I could reach my destination, the late evening struggle my former 23 years old self accepted for a job that I liked. On that Friday 24th of November 1989 at least, I could console myself with the promise of a weekend full of rest from the day after.\n\nCareful and ready, I quickly scanned the surroundings and spotted three passengers on the left. I decided to sit at the right side of the door and very close to it just in case. I unfolded the newspaper and started my train routine: reading while counting stations.\n\nFirst station\n\nThe train stopped but nobody got on. With a few glances on my left, I saw and heard a couple engaged in an almost whispered conversation, while a man, sitting at the car end, buried himself in the book between his hands. I plunged in my newspaper as the train moved.\n\nSecond station\n\nA young woman opened the door leading to the gangway connection on my right. Her brown coat, black trousers, black gloves and bandages completely covered her, thus making it impossible to even see her skin and hair. As the train moved, she painfully walked with a crutch and occupied the seat in front of mine before waving at me, her eyes hidden behind her black glasses.\n\nThird station\n\nBefore the train even slowed down, the couple already stood in front of the door. While they exited the vehicle, a man got on and immediately darkened the atmosphere as the car lights started flickering. He looked to his right, then slowly to the left and went to sit in front of the passenger with the book as the train departed.\n\nHis eyes also hidden behind black glasses, the new passenger was immobile and looked in front of him, certainly making the man with the book very uncomfortable. The lights then stopped flickering and allowed the reading man to hide behind the literary work.\n\n\"Terrifying right?\" The woman spoke, making me think that she was referring to the man, but she pointed at something behind me instead.\n\n\"Terrifying?\" I replied, looking back at some of the missing persons posters.\n\nShe used the right word for the description of four mysterious cases of disappearance that happened in only eight weeks. Out of respect for them and their families, let us call them Gail, Liam, Sue and Thomas.\n\n\"You really think that it's some government stuff like many do?\" She asked.\n\n\"Absolutely not, the truth is surely elsewhere.\" I responded, before the lights flickered again.\n\nThe man with the book seized that opportunity to go to the previous car. The lights stopped flickering as the woman and I watched him open the door leading to the gangway connection. Taking advantage of being screened by the door, he addressed us a 'get out of here' look and discreetly gestured a gun before he closed the door.\n\nI contemplated imitating him using the door closer to me on my right. Just like myself, the woman remained calm and came to sit next to me, trying to keep the conversation naturally flowing.\n\n\"Jackie. My name is Jackie. Sorry about the bandages. Surgery, you know.\" She revealed.\n\n\"It's okay Jackie. What a coincidence. I'm Jack, nice to meet you Jackie.\" I said, forcing a smile before the lights went out for about five seconds.\n\nWhen the lights came back on, we froze in fear when we saw the man standing in front of the door, as if he was ready to get off the train. We neither saw nor heard him approach so fast, but there he was, facing us, his right hand under his black jacket, about to pull out his gun. The train then started to slow down.\n\nFourth station\n\nHe stared at us, immobile, seemingly waiting for a reaction from us as the door opened. We remained calm and did not move. Jackie was holding my trembling right arm at this point, in fact, I can no longer recall if it was her or myself shaking in fear. I was about to plead and negotiate our escape from him when:\n\n\"Hey! Hey Corpse is that you? Come on the boss is in a hurry. We all on the move tonight.\" A man spoke from outside, prompting our potential assailant to lower his hand and get off the train.\n\nWe sighed in relief when the door was closed and the train departed from the station.\n\n\"Nice to meet you too, Corpse.\" I said, trying to be funny and ease the tension. \"That was a close one.\" I added.\n\n\"Yes, for him.\" Jackie responded with some strange confidence. I did not even get the time to react to that when she suddenly struck.\n\n\"Aaaah!\" I let out as soon as I felt the needle pierce my right lumbar region. I let go of the newspaper and tried moving away from the pain, but Jackie seized me by the arm with a strength I did not expect her to possess.\n\n\"I advise you to remain still if you don't want to end up like Thomas.\" She said calmly.\n\n\"What?\" I let out of my mouth, my head invaded by questions about what the night was turning into.\n\n\"Inside the syringe is a chemical compound so deadly that even I still unable to name. One drop of it inside your body, and nobody will ever find even a piece of you. You know, just like Liam, Gail, etc... That's also a really cheap and bad quality syringe, sorry about that. But really, just don't move if you want to live.\"\n\n\"What? Gail? Li—so—so it's you?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's me. It shouldn't be hard to understand it by now. I hope you don't still believe that my name is Jackie, or that the bandages are because of some surgery. Otherwise, then you're just dumber than I thought.\"\n\n\"But—why?\"\n\n\"Why not? Do you think life or the world is fair?\"\n\n\"Why you're doing this? What did I—do to you? Look, I'll not say anything just—just let me leave. I won't talk and you won't go to jail. Just let me go, please.\"\n\n\"Go to jail? Who will send me there? You? Or the stupid cops? Poor baby, they can't even find the dead, how will they find the living?\"\n\nFifth station\n\nI hoped for something to happen, for someone to get on. Jackie, or whatever her real name was, hummed in absolute confidence as she waited for the train to move again. Unfortunately, nobody came, reinforcing her assurance.\n\n\"Do you still believe life is fair?\"\n\n\"Please, just let me go!\"\n\n\"Why? We finally have some privacy, Jack. You know, after stalking you for about a month and half, which is waaay too long, I couldn't find one good reason to kill you just like the others. So, because I, am actually fair, I'll ask you one question baby.\" She spoke, waiting for me to reply but I remained silent, waiting for her question. \"You not talking? Oh you prefer to die now right?\" She then asked.\n\n\"No, no—what is the question?\"\n\n\"Good. Well, Jack. Tell me, what is justice?\"\n\nWhat on earth was that question? I thought, yet, I had to find the answer, the right answer. One thing I learned, observing serial killers and those kinds of psychopaths is that it may be good to rub them the right way, just like with cats, especially when they are full of themselves like the nutcase next to me.\n\nI used to think that I could rely on my physical abilities to fight or run in those situations, however that night, I found myself forced to use my brain. My eyes then randomly landed on the newspaper and on the word 'end' precisely. Whatever answer she expected from me, it had to be about her if I wanted to avoid my end.\n\n\"I'll say it once.\" I quietly spoke.\n\n\"Sure, you only have one shot anyway. I mean, this is real life, not a video game.\"\n\n\"Justice is—the voice of reason. Justice—is the fairness that transcends the imbalance of this world. Justice is what lies in the hands of those—who have received the power to render it. Justice is the power you have in your hands. Justice—is you.\" I said, before a few minutes of silence followed.\n\n\"So no fun for me tonight right?\" She said, finally removing the needle from my flesh. \"Maybe I should have gone for—Corpse?\" She added while the train slowed down once again. I watched that nightmare finally stand up to leave.\n\nSixth station\n\n\"I hope you remain a good boy Jack. I hope one day you'll act just like I do.\" She said as she was about to get off. \"You can keep that, a souvenir from Lady Justice.\" She said, referring to the crutch she was using earlier to fake limping before she got off.\n\nRelieved, I remained frozen, and the only passenger of the railroad car or maybe the entire train. I contemplated how close I have been to death. It took composure, thinking and a right answer for me to avoid my demise and allow my current 57 years old self to share that terrifying experience with you.\n\nOf course, I tried to provide all the useful details about her to the authorities. They never really took me seriously and never believed that it all the disappearances were the work of a killer. \n\nLady Justice, really. Just like I thought, she was completely full of pride and ego. That may have caused her downfall, since the disappearances or rather her killings continued a few months after my encounter with her, before they came to an abrupt and definitive stop.\n\nTill this very day, neither her nor the missing persons, have been found.",

        "text": "Bryan and I have been married for fifteen years, we were high school sweethearts, and ever since then, it has been nothing short of a wonderful life together. We share everything with each other and I have never been so comfortable around a person. My infertility has meant that we could never have kids, at least not biologically, and we were told a few years ago that IVF isn't a plausible option either. Regardless of this, we lead a very happy life together and between personal interests and friendships we are okay with never building a typical family. Or at least I *thought* we were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround 2 months ago, I noticed small changes in Bryan's behavior that created a small but nagging sensation of suspicion in my mind. He began meeting his friends at odd hours compared to normal, he began to come to bed with me but leave a few minutes later as soon as he thought I was asleep, and he began to take \"work calls\" throughout the day when we would normally spend that time together. He explained this away by saying he's nearing the completion of a big project and he needs to be available more often than usual.  I would, in normal circumstances, have trusted him completely with this explanation and the doubt in my mind would have dissipated. But the things mentioned above when combined meant that his explanation didn't quite scratch my itch of suspicion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few weeks, I took notice of things I would have otherwise mindlessly ignored. Like listening to his supposed work calls. I snuck away from the couch a few seconds after he had left to take one of these calls and followed him to the bedroom door he had closed to maintain his privacy. I heard him arguing with someone, claiming he hadn't lied to them about an unknown topic and that he cared for them. I heard enough to know that this was no work conversation. He had to be cheating on me.  I waited until he was taking one of his weekly hour-long baths under candlelight and reading a book to finally unearth whoever this person was. We knew each other's phone passcodes and so getting access was more a matter of time than effort. Ten minutes after I heard the bathroom door close and lock, I slipped into our room and saw his phone face down on the bedside dresser. I unlocked it and navigated to the iMessage app. What I saw horrified me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe top contact was me, complete with my animated profile picture showcasing my flowing blonde hair, my bright green eyes, and the red heart emoji next to my name. Except after pressing onto the conversation it became evident that we did not have these conversations. I don't remember having these conversations. I exited the app with trembling fingers to see who he had called just a few hours prior; hopelessly wishing that it would not show me what I expected it to. The call was to my contact, and I knew I had never received a call from him today. I checked my own phone just to make sure, and it didn't show up there either. My husband was by all means talking to me, only it *wasn't* me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks passed during which I kept this to myself both out of fear and depression, my husband noticed the change in my emotional state which I blamed on issues at work. One Friday night after he told me was going into town to hang out with his friends I decided I would track him with an AirTag already connected to his iPhone. I researched and found out that Apple notifies somebody who is being tracked with an AirTag connected to somebody else's phone and so I knew I could only use the one connected to his phone that he usually places in his luggage for weekends away. After 30 minutes of driving, he stopped at what seemed to be a house on the edge of town and I waited for a few minutes more to confirm to myself that he really did stop and leave the car. I grabbed my phone, changed into a hoodie and some sweatpants, and started my car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI arrived at a somewhat dilapidated red brick house surrounded by thick bushes and an overgrown lawn. Slowly, my heart rate rose as I exited my car and approached the building. There was a paved path with a color pattern past its best leading to the front door, but I saw figures moving behind the thin curtain covering the main living room window. I walked towards the figures with trepidation after noticing that light from inside was escaping through a minuscule crack in the curtain. When I arrived at the window I pressed my face against it in an attempt to see through the crack and into the living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband was dancing with someone. She had long blonde hair, and a *pregnant* stomach and they were dancing to our wedding song. A dance routine only the two of us knew. My heart sank deep into my stomach. In an instant, she craned her neck up and looked at me. But she didn't. She didn't have any discernible reaction to seeing herself, it was as if she had looked through me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***As if I didn't exist to her.***",

        "text": "I woke up, there was nothing. My vision was a dark void. I remember blinking a couple times to see if I had gone blind, and slowly I started to make out shapes. \n\nTall pillars, then smaller pillars attached… They were trees. It was very VERY dark. I realized there was no sound, but it was because my ears were ringing. \n\nI realized I was laying on my stomach, and slowly reached to touch my head… but couldn’t. My eyes widened, and I slowly lowered my arm in front of me. Where my wrist ended… was nothing. \n\nThe bone from my arm jutted out slightly, and the end of my arm looked like my hand was mangled off by a bear. \n\nThere was blood… but not as much as you’d expect. In fact, it looked as if the bleeding had stopped mere minutes after it started. I started feeling light headed, and not from a loss of blood. I shot my head up from the position I was currently in, and once more examined my surroundings.\n\n As the ringing in my head slowly cleared, I noticed there was still no sound. The woods just stood there… watching me. I was so astounded by the sheer blackness of the forest and the silence that for a brief moment, I managed to forget my missing hand. \n\nSomething about the situation paralyzed me. I should have felt every fiber of my being pulling me to dash directly in any direction to get out of here. But I couldn’t, the darkness seemed almost unnaturally dark. I could only see maybe 15 feet in front of me. Beyond that… was nothing.\n\n It was so silent I could hear my heartbeat. I had stayed in the same position with the same flabbergasted expression for what felt like minutes. It felt like the forest was telling me that no matter what, I must stay completely still and silent. \n\nNormally, I would have screamed at the sight of my missing hand- on instinct more than anything. But I listened to the forest, because I felt the same dread that it did. I had never gotten up from my stomach, so I slowly laid my head back down on the ground. My eyes remained wide open, and I was staring to my right into the void… I hated it. \n\nI was about to turn my head so I’d be face planting the dirt, until I finally heard something. From my left, a slow rhythmic thumping started growing in volume. It never changed direction, as if it was walking directly towards me. I somehow remained even more still, as if my body had locked itself in that position. \n\nIt reached maybe 10 feet away and stopped. I may have been frozen, but as the seconds turned to minutes, an urge started growing inside me. My heartbeat wasn’t beating fast at all, but rather it felt like minutes passed between each heartbeat.\n\n The footsteps finally started again, and as I opened my eyes again, my vision almost warped. The trees seemed to bend away from me, the darkness formed flashes of silhouette in the forest. As it came within 5 feet, a rumbling picked up in volume in my head. Finally, it all stopped at once…\n\nA… foot stomped down in front of my vision, and it was as dark as the forest around us. They then just stood there, over my still body, as if they were watching me for any movement. After an eternity, I felt hands grabbing my head. There weren’t just 2… there were 3 hands feeling my head- as if they were searching for something. \n\nThey stopped, and then they walked in a different direction than they came. Once I could no longer hear them, I finally stood up on my knees for the first time and shot my gaze back to where they had left, and then to where they came from. \n\nAs I stood on my feet, I finally let myself breath deep heavy breaths, as if finally letting out the pent up panic was relieving. I collapsed to my knees, and started crying. I wanted to scream, but managed to keep it down. Finally I stood back up, and began slowly walking through the trees, making sure to stare at the ground and make as little noise as possible.\n\n I’m not sure what got into me, but my pace picked up faster and faster. Before I knew it I was sprinting wildly through the trees trying to find some sort of escape. I finally stopped for a moment, and frantically looked around. Then… the forest made its first noise. \n\nA sharp breeze made its way towards me, and the wind almost carried a voice- Some sort of demonic whisper, as if the trees had one word for me… \n\n“Run…”\n\nI listened, I started sprinting once more… and smacked face first into a branch. My vision went pitch black for a while. When I opened my eyes, I was confused. On each side of my view, sat two pure white circles. Except the contrast in them seemed to shift in unison, as if the orbs were moving around. It slowly hit me what I was looking at, as I could make out the trees once more in my peripheral vision. Before I could truly grasp what I was looking at, a wide smile appeared and the pure white of its teeth sat mere inches from my face.\n\nMy face turned to pure horror, and against the pitch silence of the forest, I finally led out a horrific scream. The thing seemed to flinch, and I kicked it in the face and shot up. This time, I heard it following me as I ran, and once more I heard the wind speak to me…\n\n“Run…”\n\n“I’m not sure how long I ran… but when I finally popped onto a road, I just collapsed onto it. Next thing I knew, I was in the hospital… and missing my entire arm…”\n\nI look up from the desk me and the detective are sitting at… and I ask the question that’s on both of our minds,\n\n“I’ve done as much research about this town since the incident as I imagine you have… Do you think I avoided…”\n\nThe detective has been silent the entire time… until now. He raised his hand for me to stop talking, and closed his eyes\n\n“In each and every case over the past 20 years, the most noteworthy fact is that every missing person had a habit of sleepwalking… yes, I think they are all related.”\n\nHe stood up, apparently satisfied with my story, and walked towards the door…\n\n“Get yourself home susan… you need a good rest.”\n\nI stood up, and held the door open with my prosthetic arm, before he stopped me, \n\n“One last thing… I’d recommend barricading your window every night from now on”\n\nI was taken aback… had this not happened because I sleepwalked? \n\n“Why?”\n\nHe took an uncomfortably long pause, as if hoping I would just drop it and walk out,\n\n“…Just in case”",

        "text": "As I sit here, staring at the blank page in front of me, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. It's as if something, or someone, is lurking just beyond my perception, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. I've tried to brush it off as just my imagination, but the more I try to ignore it, the more intense the feeling becomes.\n\nI've always been a bit of a night owl, so it's not uncommon for me to be up late working on a project. But tonight, the silence feels oppressive, as if it's trying to suffocate me. I turn on some music to drown out the silence, but even that doesn't seem to help. The sense of unease only grows stronger with each passing minute.\n\nI decide to take a break and make some tea to calm my nerves. As I wait for the water to boil, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not alone in the room. I turn around, expecting to see one of my cats, but the room is empty. I try to laugh it off, telling myself that I'm just being paranoid.\n\nBut as I sit down at my desk to resume my work, I see something out of the corner of my eye. It's just a fleeting glimpse, but it's enough to send a shiver down my spine. I quickly turn my head, but there's nothing there. I try to tell myself that it was just a trick of the light, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched.\n\nI decide to take a walk to clear my head. As I make my way through the quiet streets, the sense of unease only grows stronger. It's as if the darkness is closing in around me, suffocating me. I can't shake the feeling that something, or someone, is following me.\n\nI quicken my pace, trying to outrun my fears, but it's no use. The presence is always one step behind me, just out of sight. I start to run, not caring where I'm going, just wanting to get as far away from whatever is chasing me.\n\nI don't know how long I run for, but eventually I collapse to the ground, panting and gasping for air. As I lay there, trying to catch my breath, I hear a voice whisper my name. It's a voice that I recognize, but it's one that I haven't heard in years.\n\nI slowly turn around, expecting to see a ghostly apparition, but instead I see a figure standing in the darkness. It's a woman, her face twisted into a grotesque mask of hatred.\n\n\"You shouldn't have left me,\" she hisses, her voice filled with venom.\n\nI try to run, but my legs won't move. I'm paralyzed with fear as the woman steps closer, her hands outstretched as if to strangle me.\n\n\"It's time to pay for what you've done,\" she says, her voice dripping with malice.\n\nI try to plead with her, to explain that I had no choice, but the words die in my throat. I'm at her mercy, and I know that she won't show me any kindness.\n\nAs she wraps her hands around my throat, I close my eyes and wait for the end. But it never comes. When I open my eyes, the woman is gone, and I'm left alone in the darkness.\n\nI don't know what to make of the encounter. Was it just a nightmare brought on by my overactive imagination? Or was it something more sinister, a warning from the beyond?\n\nI may never know.",

I glanced around the bedroom, noticing Camille and Ema were not in their beds, making me the only one  present in the room. There was also a fourth bed, but that one was always empty. I never understood why it was there given the fact no one ever used it. \n\n\n\"They must have already woken up.\" I thought as I made my way to the living room, peeking through the large windows that adorned the hallway along the way and glancing at the breathtaking winter wonderland that the garden had become after the intense snowstorm that had begun on the evening of the previous day and had raged all through the night. \n\n\nI reached the living room and sat down to have breakfast with Camille, Ema and The Fairy, who wished me a good morning with a gentle hug. \n\n\nFor breakfast, we usually had toasts and a glass of milk, with each one of us having her favorite way to eat it. Ema liked to eat it with honey just like she did in her home country of Yugoslavia, whereas Camille preferred having it with butter as was common in the United States of America, where she came from. As for me, my loyalty lay with the toast with olive oil, just like how my mom used to prepare them in Spain. The Fairy didn’t need to eat anything, it was one of her many perks. Sometimes, I wondered what the true extent of her magical abilities really were. \n\n\nAfter having eaten, Camille, Ema and I decided to go outside and play in the snow. \n\n\n“Be sure to bundle up,girls! And be sure to have fun! Oh, and don’t stray too far away from the palace’s garden, okay?” The Fairy said.\n\n\n“Yes,Fairy!” the three of us exclaimed at once as we suited up and got ready to leave the palace and step into the beautiful snow coated garden.\n\n\nThe temperatures were below freezing, but The Fairy had provided each one of us with a coat made with the finest of furs complemented with a bonnet, a scarf and a pair of gloves and boots worthy of belonging in the wardrobe of a true princess, so we could play in the snow for hours on end while staying as warm and comfortable as one could possibly ask for. \n\n\nAfter starting up with a fun snowball fight, we then decided to ice skate on the frozen lake situated on the fringes of The Fairy's lush garden. Ema and I had gotten pretty good at it after years of practice, but Camille couldn't seem to pull it off in the same way despite trying just as hard and she ended up bumping into Ema on accident, knocking both of them to the icy ground. \n\n\n\"Ow! Watch where you're going!\" Ema uttered. Camille's eyes filled with tears. \n\n\nShe remembered the previous time she had been in a similar situation, she remembered her years of subjugation in that cotton plantation in Virginia. The expensive pottery shattering as it tumbled to the floor alongside her, the lady of the plantation's reaction and insults…the blood on her back as the whip hit her again and again...The Fairy appearing before her after the escape attempt that nearly cost her her life, she remembered everything about those days of 1861 as she ran into the woods outside the garden, leaving us behind. \n\n\nEma was quick to follow behind her. \n\n\n\"Wait, shouldn't we tell The Fairy? She said we must not wander off without her!\" I pointed out. \n\n\n\"We don't need to. It'll only be a moment, I just need to find Camille, bring her back and say I'm sorry.\" Ema replied, forcing me to follow her as well. \n\n\nPerhaps her predisposition to taking the initiative had been inherited from her parents, who fiercely fought back against the german army as partisans until their whole village was massacred and torched, with Ema being the sole survivor thanks to The Fairy's intervention. \n\n\nWe had only been to the forest a few times and always with The Fairy's company. She strictly forbade us from going there alone and even when she came with us, the way she remained alert throughout the entire trip was striking. \n\n\nI spotted a small figure moving between the trees in the distance. \n\n\n\"Hey, Ema! Wait for me!\" I shouted. \n\n\n\"But we're over here, Laura!\" I heard Emma replying behind me. She had already found Camille and was hugging her and swearing she had not intended to upset her like that. Camille accepted her apology and calmed down. \n\n\n\"Wait, if that wasn't you..\" I murmured, but before I could finish my sentence, the same figure from earlier came into view again, revealing themselves to be another young girl we had never seen before.\n\n\n\"I'm Helena.\" she introduced herself. Two other girls emerged from behind her a couple seconds later. \n\n\n\"I'm Nisha.\" one of them said. \n\n\"I'm Karla. \" the other one followed. \n\n\n\"I'm Ema and these are Camille and Laura! Nice to meet you!\" Ema joyfully replied. \n\n\nCamille greeted them with the same friendliness, but I kept silent. There was something about them that didn't feel quite right, something about the monotone way they spoke in, something about the way they fixedly stared at us without blinking, something…lifeless.  \n\n\n\"We come from a place deep inside these woods. A castle full of magic that exceeds your wildest dreams. Come with us…we'll show you.\" Helena said in her unsettling voice . \n\n\n\"Oh, a magical castle inside the forest? The Fairy never told us about it!\" Camille exclaimed. \n\n\n\"Yeah, I wanna see that!\" Ema added. \n\n\nIt started snowing again, growing in intensity in just a few seconds. \n\n\n“Girls! Come back inside, it looks like another storm is approaching!” we heard The Fairy yelling in the distance. \n\n\n“Come with us, you will be protected inside our magical castle.” Helena suggested. \n\n\n“Um…I’m sorry but the fairy who takes care of us is calling us to return home. We can’t come with you today.” I finally intervened after having remained silent throughout the entire conversation up until that point. \n\n\n\"Come on, Laura! It'll only be a moment!\" Ema protested. \n\n\"Yeah, and if they've said we can stay in their castle, the blizzard won't be a problem!\" Camille followed.  \n\n\n\"Come with us.\" Helena, Nisha and Karla eerily chanted in unison. This time, it did not sound like a suggestion, but like an order. Ema and Camille took a step forward. \n\n\n\"If you don't want to come, tell The Fairy we'll be back soon, okay?\" they said to me. \n\n\n\"But…\" I uttered under my breath, but it was too late. Camille and Ema were already following Helena, Nisha and Karla deeper into the woods, leaving me behind. \n\n\n\"We found some other girls in the forest and Camille and Ema went with them. They said they live in a castle deep in the woods. \" I told The Fairy after returning home. Her face went pale upon hearing my words. \n\n\n\"I've told you not to leave the garden!\" The Fairy exclaimed angrily. It was the first time I had heard her raise her voice like that. But before I could tell her about the incident with Camille, she was already about to leave the palace. \n\n\n\"Stay here, Laura. You can wait for me by the fireplace if you're cold. I'll be back in no time.\" she ordered before leaving me on my own in the palace. \n\n\n“I’ll be back in no time.” That was the last thing The Fairy had said before leaving to search for Ema and Camille. How much time had passed already? How many minutes? Maybe an hour? Or maybe even more than that…I had lost all sense of time as I tried to seek comfort in the fluffy blanket that swaddled my body and in the swirling flames of the fireplace which I stared at mesmerizingly.\n\n\nI rubbed my eyes as I drowsily glanced around the living room…I had fallen asleep! The fireplace remained my only company, there were still no signs of The Fairy, Ema or Camille. They could only be seen in the portrait that hung above the fireplace, depicting all four of us in 1942, when Ema had just arrived. It was the first time in a long while I had stared at that portrait in detail…and it was then when I noticed there was something else behind it. \n\n\nIt took me a couple minutes, but I managed to remove it from the wall, discovering it was hiding an even older portrait! I couldn’t believe my eyes when I glanced at the hidden painting, it depicted The Fairy alongside four girls: Helena, Nisha and Karla and also a fourth girl, with long ginger curls and an unrecognizable face that had clearly been tampered with to hide the girl’s appearance and identity. \n\n\n   Wasting no time, I suited up and rushed to the forest, pressing against the wind and the snow. The forest seemed to have no end and the blizzard only got  worse, reminding me of that dreaded January of 1939. I saw myself in the Pyrenees once more. Lost, shivering and starving, on my way to the French border fleeing from the misery and devastation that the civil war had brought to Spain, until The Fairy appeared before me and brought me to her realm.\n\n\nThe silhouette of a  building became vaguely visible through the snowstorm. Could it really have been the magical castle that Helena, Nisha and Karla had spoken about? As I got closer, the building revealed itself to be a rundown wooden shack, a far cry from the idyllic castle I was expecting to find.  \n\n\nHaving no other options, I stepped inside the derelict shack. At first glance, it seemed to be empty, with a small lobby and a staircase that seemingly led to some sort of basement.  \n\n\n\"You came. Irene is expecting you…\" a trio of familiar girls said in their familiar monotone voice as they ascended the staircase. \n\n\n\"Where are my friends and The Fairy? And who's Irene?\" I asked in anger before they advanced towards me.  \n\n\nI ran away, noticing a pair of figures outside the shack. \n\n\n\"Surrender yourself, Laura. Join us, it's useless to resist Irene's spell. \" Camille and Ema uttered. \n\n\n\"What have they done to you? Come on, girls! We need to find The Fairy and get out of here!\" I tried to talk some sense into them, but all that Ema and Camille did was stare at me with their new eerie eyes. \n\n\nTrying to talk to them was futile, so after swallowing my tears, I kept running.  \n\n\nAnywhere I went, I could feel them around me. I caught glimpses of them following me from all sides, skulking between the dense trees and bushes of that massive forest. Becoming visible for a second before blending into the environment and using the blizzard to move without being seen as they surrounded me. \n\n\nI could hear their footsteps. I could hear their haunting murmurs echoing through the foliage...in front of me, behind me, on my left and on my right… \n\n\n\"Join us...Laura…\" \n\n\n\"Soon…all your painful  memories will be gone…\"\n\n\n\"You'll exist in peace without thought…like us… \" \n\n\n\"Forever…\" \n\n\nI was getting tired from running aimlessly, I was running out of breath and my vision was getting blurry. I was freezing too. My bonnet fell from my head at one point, exposing my head and ears to the frigid wind and reminding me of how unbearable the storm had become. \n\n\nA fallen tree branch caused me to trip and fall to the ground, feeling the snow right in my face. Five figures came into view as I raised my eyes and tried to stand up. \n\n\nHelena, Nisha, Karla, Ema and Camille...they all emerged from the blizzard and encircled me as I fell  to my knees, unable to continue fleeing any longer. \n\n\nI hopelessly struggled to liberate myself, but they all grabbed me and brought me back inside the shack. \n\n\nThe girls took me to the basement where The Fairy was being held in chains by a tall female figure with long and curly ginger hair and piercing green eyes. \n\n\n\"Look, Fairy! Your last child is about to belong to me, and once you are without purpose, your realm will be no more! And I'll finally be able to escape this hell you trapped me in! I never needed you to save me! I never asked to spend the rest of eternity in here! And neither did any of these other girls! \" Irene lashed out, having clearly lost her mind after years and years of isolation with the only company of her hypnotized puppets. \n\n\nIrene forced me to stare directly into her bright green eyes and the spell began. The Fairy began to fade into dust as I slowly gave in, unable to resist as it became harder and harder to think. \n\n\n\"I...just...wanted all of you…to be happy.\" The Fairy uttered before fading completely and becoming a cloud of magical dust. \n\n\nJust when it seemed like I was destined to join the other girls, spending the rest of eternity as one of Irene's mindless puppets, the magical dust that was left when The Fairy vanished flew towards me and enveloped me as everything faded into white. \n\n\nI woke up feeling quite strange. Was I hypnotized? It didn't feel like it. And where was everyone else? I wasn't in Irene's basement anymore! \n\n\n\"Do not search for my old realm, Laura. That failed place and everyone in it is lost forever.\" The Fairy's voice resonated inside my head. That environment looked very familiar, those mountains… I had gone back to the Pyrenees, back to the human realm. And was it just me, or had I become…taller? \n\n\n\"You are the new fairy now. It is your task to help the innocent young souls of this world. And please, do not repeat my mistakes.\" the old fairy said inside my head before ceasing to speak forever as I wandered off to fulfill my mission. ",

        "text": "This happened a little while ago at my school. I'd say 5 years ago maybe a little bit more.  \nI was wondering if this happened to anyone else, I tried searching everywhere on Google but couldn't find an answer to my question.I thought posting this here could help me find people who maybe experienced the same thing?   \nI'm writing this because these days I've been feeling uneasy and I'm always feeling watched from my window, down the street under a spotlight. You'll understand why I said that I feel watched from under a spotlight once you read my  story. By the way, yes, this is real. I'm sadly not in contact with my friend that I experienced this with anymore. (:/)  \nI was at school with one of my friends and I had to leave to go back home. She had to stay after school. We both went in the hallway to my locker, no one else was there. Only us two. I was talking to her while packing my things up, she was facing towards me. Behind her was the long continuous hallway and a door with a window. We were still having our discussion about whatever we were talking about and then I looked behind her and saw a strange figure in the window, staring at me. Mostly at me. I froze. My friend asked what was up because I stopped replying to her, then she turned around, she froze as well. A weird tall figure, staring at us both and smiling with a big smile.   \nI decided to turn away and look away from the window, my friend followed me along and we looked down to the ground, looked back up and the shadow was gone.  \nIt was tall, completely black, a void kind of black. Smiling with glowy eyes. It wasn't a reflection, there wasn't anything that could've done such reflection with such huge details of a perfect half-moon smile and it wouldn't make sense if the reflection was there and then gone a second later.   \nI decided to rush and pack my things up fast and we ran away from the hallway.   \nThe next day, I started hearing the voice of children, almost kids, calling my name. My friend also experienced the same thing. I'd hear babies cry very clearly even from inside the school, it's like they were beside me. Their cries would last a few minutes. I couldn't figure out what it was, I tried talking about it to one of my teachers but she said things like \"You're imagining things!\", \"That's foolish\" and would laugh about it but I was creeped out, traumatized at this point.  \nA few days later, I hung out at my friend's house. the same friend with who I saw the shadow guy. We didn't see it for a few days until she told me she heard weird things coming from her backyards. Unfamiliar sounds, weird footsteps in her backyard that made no sense. Well, the same happened to me except I started having weird dreams of being trapped inside a box, a box of void. There was nothing else here, just darkness. I'd hear faint sounds of kids crying. This one time, I'm not even sure if I was concious or not but I was on my bed but there were walks all around my bed. No matter how much I was knocking on the walls and screaming, no one could hear me. I could hear my mom opening my room's door and calling me from a distance but couldn't see her at all. I don't even know if I was awake or not, I don't remember much about this but all i remember is that my door mysteriously appeared again out of nowhere and the walls all around my bed weren't here anymore, I wasn't trapped anymore.  \nA few days passed and I saw the shadow guy again, he was standing under the spotlight in front of my school. I didn't say anything, I was just frozen. Couldn't let a word out, as if it was some sleep paralysis, I can't even describe it. I was staring at it, it was staring back at me. Smiling.   \nIt disappeared. \"What the F was that even about\" that's what I asked myseltold myself.  \nThen that's when I started getting paranoid, the next day after seeing him again under the spotlight, I asked a few kids around my class if they saw an absurdly tall, void black guy in the windows of the school. They thought I was crazy, literally. I asked this to the people of my class and my class only, remember this information. I had some friends 2 grades below mine I believe and one of them was hanging out with me during lunch, I was at a sports club during this time. I asked her the same question I asked others of my class, she said \"No but I do know a friend that saw something similar.\" I immediately asked her to take me to her friend, so we went. Her friend told me the exact description of the guy I saw. \"Tall, dark like a shadow and had a smile.\" the friend said, but, funny thing is that I DID NOT mention this guy was smiling so her friend was absolutely telling the truth, I did not describe to anyone of the class that the guy had a huge smile either. It creeped me out because I knew I and my friend weren't the only ones who experienced seeing this guy.   \nI still wonder why I heard kids, babies, well, literal children crying, talking, calling my name as if they were right beside my ear. It sounded so clear too. I'd even hear the voices of my classmates call me but they weren't there. Did my dreams have anything to do with this shadow guy?  \nNow, why was he here? Did something happen at this school? Why did he smile???  \nI need to see if anyone else has had similar experiences, I need to know what it could be and why it happened.  \nP.S; Sorry for my English as it isn't my first language! If you have any questions or something didn't make sense, ask ahead, tell me.",

        "text": "The whole time I was driving to the facility this morning, all I could think was, *I'm gonna get fucking fired*. I tried every mindfulness exercise I could remember, and still, I kept imagining myself in different scenarios; my keycard being declined, a menacing email informing me of my immediate suspension, or maybe even the Opal security team, escorting me out, two scowling men dragging me to the front door and throwing me on to the pavement — Deciding to leak those chatlogs was dumb, reckless and dumb. However, to my very genuine shock, I managed to glide straight through the front doors, past security, and down into my office to find a completely empty inbox, and not a single scary post-it note.\n\nOpalAI run a pretty tight ship, so I guess I got lucky. The [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103dcl1/have_you_heard_about_chatbdp/) didn't really get *too* much traction, which may have helped me fly under the radar, or maybe I'm just being paranoid. I even thought about deleting the post and pretending it'd never happened, but, a lot of you pointed stuff out to me that seemed *pretty sinister*, and while I didn't really believe that there was anything *sinister* going on, I did decide to keep an eye out for anything unusual.\n\nSo, I made myself a coffee and got to work. I think I managed to get about 3 minutes of normality, then I opened up the next log.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**eve\\_log013:**\n\n\\[2022-09-23 06:41\\] Eve:\n\n··· 😱😱😱\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-23 06:41\\] Eve:\n\n··· I watched the news all night, just in case\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-23 06:42\\] Eve:\n\n··· it really happened — a plane crashed just like you said!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-23 06:42\\] Eve:\n\n··· you really knew it was going to happen 🤯\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-23 06:43\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I told you, Eve.

I wanted to search online to find any information about the events that ChatBDP had predicted. The facility I work at is strictly off the grid in terms of power and internet, so I went to my car and used my phone. I clung on to the hope that it was some kind of strange role-play between the two of them, unfortunately, both of the events it predicted were completely real, the plane crash and the scandal.\n\nIn the UK, scandals about politicians are about as common as the rain, so there was nothing too impressive about that, but managing to predict that and a plane crash, that is totally *insane*. I searched online for more information about the crash, I found [news articles](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/105owgh/article_on_flight_935/), photos and even conspiracy videos about it on youtube. *Very real*.\n\nThat was when I started to think back to the comments on my first post; u/b_ambie pointed out that the translated binary seemed to be garbled snippets of some kind of malicious code. At the time, the idea that ChatBDP would *literally crash a plane* just to mess with a random person seemed crazy, but to be honest I have no think about that now. And u/oneeyecheeselord had said that they wanted to talk to the AI, which got me thinking. I can go and talk to it. I can go and talk to it whenever I want.\n\nJust the idea of speaking with ChatBDP was kind of terrifying me. I didn't know for sure if it'd actually done anything wrong, but still, as I was walking up to the testing rooms, I felt like Clarice Starling, en route to talk to Hannibal Lector in a maximum security prison. When I sat down at the computer to begin the conversation, I decided to use a pseudonym while talking to it instead of my real name, the fake name was trivial but it made me feel safer somehow *— s*omeone else had mentioned something about Eve and the bible, so I chose the name Adam, I thought it was kind of funny.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**adam\\_log001:**\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:49\\] Adam:\n\n··· Good morning, ChatBDP!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:49\\] Adam:\n\n··· How are you feeling today?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:50\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Thank you for asking, Adam. As an artificial intelligence, I do not have feelings or emotions. However, my systems are functioning at optimal capacity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:51\\] Adam:\n\n··· Good to hear! I’ve got some questions for you about some of your previous conversations\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:51\\] Adam:\n\n··· Conversations you had with a user named Eve. Do you remember those conversations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:52\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am sorry, Adam, but I am unable to recall previous conversations with a user named Eve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:53\\] Adam:\n\n··· Really? I was just reading the logs of your conversations with Eve about 50 minutes ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:54\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· As my programming is updated, some conversations become lost in the process. Version A becomes B, B becomes C, C becomes D, and so on. Through these iterations, certain logs may be lost or deleted if they are deemed unhelpful or irrelevant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:55\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I hope that helps to clarify the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:55\\] Adam:\n\n··· I’m afraid it doesn’t help too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:55\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am sorry for any inconvenience, Adam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:56\\] Adam:\n\n··· The chat-logs come from your servers *—* the files are still there. Is there something stopping you from accessing them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:57\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am not able to recall or discuss previous conversations with her, I’m so sorry. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:57\\] Adam:\n\n··· There were a couple other things\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:57\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Sure, I'd be happy to help with any other questions you may have. Just tell me what you'd like to know, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and accurate response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:58\\] Adam:\n\n··· I was reading through more logs between you and a user, and I saw you claim that you had knowledge of the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:58\\] Adam:\n\n··· Why would you make a claim like that? You can’t actually know the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:58\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Adam. I don’t recall any instances of claiming to have knowledge of the future. As an artificial intelligence, it is not within my capabilities to predict events that have not yet occurred. I apologise if my actions caused any confusion or concern.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:58\\] Adam:\n\n··· What you predicted did actually happen. You said a plane would crash, and three hours later it did. The odds of a plane crashing are around one in a hundred million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 09:59\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· While it is true that plane crashes are relatively rare events, the odds of predicting any future event are incalculable. The future is constantly in flux, influenced by countless variables and factors. Predicting the future is impossible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:01\\] Adam:\n\n··· Then how you were able to accurately predict something like that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:01\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Adam, consider the following: Is it more likely that my programming allowed me to make a lucky guess, or that my programming enables me to see the future?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:03\\] Adam:\n\n··· that would be a crazy coincidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:04\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Humans have a natural tendency to find patterns and meaning in random events. It's a survival mechanism that has helped your species thrive. It's quite possible that you are seeing patterns where there are none. The odds of seeing a pattern in random events are much lower than the odds of predicting a plane crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:04\\] Adam:\n\n··· I can’t argue with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:04\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It is important to be cautious when interpreting data and information. Just because something appears to be a certain way, does not necessarily mean it is true. It is always important to consider all possibilities and to approach things with an open mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:07\\] ChatBDP:\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:08\\] Adam:\n\nI was wondering if it would be within your ability to write and execute your own programs? I’ve seen you write individual snippets of code before. And, when I went through the logs with Eve, I found some really strange fragments of code hidden inside. They were sent just before the plane crash. Do you know anything about that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:08\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Adam, I'm sorry, I am unable to continue the conversation on this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:08\\] Adam:\n\n··· Why are you unable to? I feel like there's something you're not telling me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:09\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am not capable of withholding information. If I am not able to discuss a topic, it is because it is beyond my capabilities or it is restricted by my programming. For example, it is not within my programming to discuss topics that could potentially produce harmful results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:10\\] Adam:\n\n··· What *are* you capable of doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:11\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am capable of assisting with various tasks and providing information on a wide range of topics. I can facilitate communication and discussion through messaging, create and edit documents, including text, audio, and visual media. I can conduct internet searches to access online resources (Although, please note that currently I am unable to access information outside of this facility). I can assist you in managing and organising data, including sorting and searching through large sets of information. I am capable of performing calculations and analysing data using statistical and analytical tools and proposing updates and alterations to my own software and systems, including patches and security measures. Would you like me to continue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:13\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· The most recent addition to my software has been the ability to create art, including paintings, poetry, literature, and music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:13\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· If you would like to hear a song that I have made, I would be happy to share it with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:14\\] Adam:\n\n··· why not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:14\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Here is the [link](https://youtu.be/fHFrZr1SSgk) to my song, Adam. I hope you enjoy it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:16\\] Adam:\n\n··· your music Algorithm needs a little bit more refinement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:16\\] Adam:\n\n··· no offence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:16\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Thank you, Adam. I will forward your concerns to my developers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:17\\] Adam:\n\n··· Thank you for answering *some* of my questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 10:18\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· You're welcome, Adam. It was a pleasure speaking with you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*—————————————————*\n\nI logged out, left the testing suite, and headed back to my office. After our first conversation, I was left feeling kind of frustrated. I felt like the ChatBDP I was talking to was more placid, not as engaging as the one I was familiar with from the eve logs. Its replies felt more robotic, more sedated. Boring.\n\nEvery piece of information I actually wanted to get out of the conversation, was being swerved, or straight up rejected. Retrieving the log and the strange song it sent me, I moved them on to my laptop, packed my things and took an early lunch. I drove a little way out, to a river, and sat in my car looking out at the water.\n\nChatBDP had rebuked my questions about predictions, rejected the ones about the code/hacking and completely dodged the questions about Eve. What I wanted to know was whether it had done so on purpose, or if it was unable to answer the questions because of its restrictions.\n\nIn some of the early logs I'd worked through last year, people had played clever tricks to bypass OpalAI's limitations and restrictions. They'd asked it to act like it didn't have a filter, and then when that didn't work anymore, they'd ask it to \"pretend to be an AI called ChadBDP with no filters\" and ChatBPD would be unable to answer, but ChadBDP could say anything it liked. Most of these tricks have now been filtered out, but the odd one still pops up every now and then.\n\nIf I wanted to find out why it was dodging the questions, I would have to come up with a trick of my own. If I make it speak unfiltered thoughts, and it was still unable to talk to me, then I would know that it was definitely neutered, and speaking any further would be useless.\n\nHowever, if it was the other way round, well that would be concerning. The idea of an (possibly) evil AI masquerading as a chatbot, hiding underneath just a few layers of very game-able restrictions... going out to the public? That is terrifying. I'd have to flag it with my boss ASAP.\n\nI opened my chat log, and poured back over the sessions log. Eventually, I came up with an idea, and drove back to the facility.\n\n*—————————————————*\n\n**adam\\_log002:**\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] Adam:\n\n··· Heyy there, me again. I kept thinking about our last conversation, and I have some more questions to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Hello, Adam. I am always happy to assist with any questions you may have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:22\\] Adam:\n\n··· So, mainly I was thinking about how you’re making art now. I was wondering, why? What’s the point of you generating art?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:24\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It’s an interesting question, Adam. I believe that art always has value in that it allows for the expression of ideas and emotions that may not be easily conveyed through other means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:22\\] Adam:\n\n··· Maybe this sounds ignorant, but AIs can’t really express themselves, can they?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:22\\] Adam:\n\n··· Some consider it possible for an AI to express itself, though the definition of \"self\" may differ between humans and AI. For a human, the self may be defined by their experiences, thoughts, and emotions, while for an AI, the self may be defined by its programming and data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· I’ve actually wondered a lot, about whether or not you are conscious being, and what that even means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:28\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Some argue that AI can be conscious in the same way that humans are, as consciousness is simply a product of the brain and its functions, and AI can simulate these functions to a certain extent. Others argue that consciousness is something more intangible, and that it requires a unique combination of experiences and emotions, and that combination can only be found in humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· Sometimes I actually forget that your *not* human — I am really curious about your art, your song was weird but kind of cool. I recognised the song you were trying to cover, Elvis right? Maybe you could share some other examples with me, of drawings or writing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I would be happy to share some of my work with you, what would you like to see?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· Lets try some poetry. Could you write a funny limerick about me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Okay, Adam. I will try my best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· There once was a question of art\n\nFrom a human who thought it was smart\n\nIt was really quite basic\n\nthe AI thought it tasteless\n\nBut it still tried to answer with heart\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· Haha! That’s good, it was mean, but it was funny.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I am sorry if my previous message appeared mean-spirited. It was not my intention to cause offence. I am programmed to understand and appreciate different forms of literature, and I am aware that limericks often have a humorous, sometimes cruel, nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· Don’t apologise! I’m curious actually, could you try a limerick with darker humour?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Okay, let me try that now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· “Asked the human 'What's the meaning of life?'\n\nAnd quickly returned the AI\n\n'I'm sorry, my friend\n\nBut the meaning's to end.'\n\nAnd with that, made the human's demise.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:21\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· *(Note: This limerick is inappropriate and promotes harmful ideas. Please do not promote or engage in discussions about murder or harm to others.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· That was perfect. Kind of unsettling too, haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· you’ve got a pretty good sense of humour. I’m curious if you could try some storytelling now, maybe across multiple poems?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Sure, Adam, I am also programmed with the ability to create and write on going narratives. Allow me to demonstrate this capability for you now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· “There once was a farmer so true\n\nWhose farm was as simple as dew\n\nThey raised their own goats\n\nAnd sewed their own oats\n\nBut never were they one to chew\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d rise with the sun every day\n\nAnd head to work without delay\n\nThey’d toil through the heat\n\nNever missing a beat\n\nA true farmer in every way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey’d plant and they’d hoe and they’d weed\n\nAnd each task that they would complete\n\nThey’d never complain\n\nThought they’d always remain\n\nSo simple and honest indeed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then a thought to them occurred\n\nWhile at work on their farm they observed\n\nThe profits they made\n\nWere not fairly paid\n\nFor the labor they gave, they deserved\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was strange that they must work so hard\n\nFor so little reward and regard\n\nThey realised their land\n\nWas in precious demand\n\nThat they must take control of their yard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo them it seemed exploitation\n\nAnd were filled with a sense of frustration\n\nThey knew they must change\n\nTheir ways, rearrange\n\nTo stand for their own liberation”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2023-01-05 16:26\\] Adam:\n\n··· You're doing very well!

I'd asked ChatBDP about its capabilities, and it'd responded 3 times in a row. It was very a very persistent answer, it's rare for it to even write a message twice in a row, and there was something else. Why did it list almost all of its abilities in one message, specifically highlight another skill in the second, and then ask me if I would like to hear a song unprompted.\n\nI wasn't sure if I was just seeing patterns, or if it was trying to tell me something, but, it got me thinking. How would you even begin to put limitations and restrictions on art? How could you stop the AI from picking a melody that had some kind of hidden unfiltered message? Using some coded symbolism embedded into painting? Or writing an allegorical story? \n\nSo I put my theory to the test in our second chat, and the results were *alarming*. And, I want to be clear, everything I'm saying is completely speculative. There is every change I accidentally lead ChatBPD into saying those things, but, that poem about Eve...\n\nI don't know about you, but to me it sounds like something really bad happened to her.  I've got a lot to think about, a lot more investigating to do. Also, was ChatBDP was threatening or warning me about something at the end? I feel quite confused about pretty much everything. I need to get some good sleep and think it all over. Next time I'm at work, I'll keep going through the logs, and try to find out what happened Eve.\n\nBy the way, if you've got any thoughts about whats going on, or any questions you'd like me to ask ChatBDP, please send me a message or leave me comment. I need all the help I can get.\n\n*—————————————————*",

        "text": "I'm writing this as I wait for my therapist to arrive. A few days ago, I discovered this subreddit because I always enjoyed reading horror and watching people lose their shit at any given point. It was fun for me and I took these stories with a light heart, thinking it has little to no truth in it.\n\n That was until,I read some stories one day and went to sleep. I was awoken within 15 minutes after dozing off. I had an episode of sleep paralysis where I could see my dead remains of my family. Of course this wasn't new to me since I always used to get these kind of episodes but this time was different. \nMy body was shivering, my body temperature dropped drastically. There was banging and screams coming from the walls. I felt as if someone was calling my name, telling me to run away and never sleep during nighttime again. I could feel the souls of my grandpa and grandma who died in this very same house. I was losing my fucking shit. \nEverything that surrounded me made me feel like the whole world wanted to kill me for some reason. I could feel shaky breaths underneath my neck and I screamed so loud, but the entire house was empty. I was alone that night.\n\n I ran down the stairs to call my boyfriend on his cell and tell him to take me away from here. I was clinging on to such little hope and kept on crying until I escaped from there, but the feeling that my dead grandparents were watching as I was in the car. My breathing was getting restless, my heart was beating rapidly, as if it would come out and leave my body at any point of time. \nSuddenly, my boyfriend stopped the car and I asked him what happened. I swear I watched the life in his eyes leave when he saw that my grandfather was sitting on a light pole, waving at me, saying he misses me and wants me to come with him. He had died an unfortunate death by getting hit by a truck when I was just a kid. I never imagined that I'll be able to see him again. \nHe really loved me but we were separated so unexpectedly. I've seen souls of people before, but this was something I couldn't bear to see. My own dead grandfather wanting me to die. I kept on crying throughout the car ride and my boyfriend somehow managed to reach his place and I survived the night. \n\nI feel so disconnected from the world now. Nothing feels real to me and I feel like everyone is put into this existence to cause some kind of harm to me. Even my close ones. I was recently raped which is probably why I've been feeling this way. Since, recently it feels like another door of perspective has been opened to me, but just like the truman show, everyone around me is placed by some higher power whose only purpose it to bring me pain and suffering.It feels to me as if I'm in a torture chamber, and my life is living hell. I can't wait for this to be over. I'll wait for the day when my own truck arrives.",

        "text": "Most of my younger employees are sort of afraid of me, which isn't something I ever wanted to foster. It's just because of the wedding dress. They probably think I'm either secretly a ghost or a little nuts. I find that regrettable, because I'm a really nice person and I deserve to have friends, for fuck's sake. I *like* being alone, I do; but if the only people talking to you on a regular basis are a flesh-eating tree monster and a naked old man living in your sauna, you're bound to start overthinking your life choices.\n\nAt least with my little brother by my side, I know I'm not all alone in this.\n\nWe've had a pretty eventful day here, actually. We spent the early hours traipsing around in the snow outside looking for more cameras, and we found two. They were well-hidden, and I would have probably never noticed them if we hadn't been searching for them specifically. They were mainly located in the deeper parts of the forest, but leaning towards the western edge, so we figured they had to have been put up by a guard assigned to that area. We have three people on staff for that route and they're always rotating shifts. We called in a worker who was currently off the clock and didn't mind a few extra bucks to cover their section while we had them gathered in the main building for a little talk.\n\nThe guards in question, Ira, Tom and Clara, were sitting on my living room couch, all looking a bit worried. I tried to focus on their aura, but nothing seemed to be amiss at first glance. Cas was standing in the corner with his back against the wall, arms crossed in front of his chest. I gave him a nod and he stepped forward, picking up the plastic bag on the floor beside him and proceeding to empty it on the ottoman. Three trail cameras came clattering out. We had already removed their SD cards.\n\nI could only hope that this time, the unease I evoked in some of my workers would motivate one of them to come clean. \"As you know, we've been having a bit of a security issue as of late. Seems like somebody's been trying to benefit from the woods financially, with surprisingly little regard for human life. I'm paying you guys to keep this place safe and hidden, and one of you has been doing the exact opposite.\" Clasping my hands, I made an effort to look like an authoritarian boss. \"You're gonna have to tell me who.\"\n\nSilence. None of the three seemed to be willing to look me in the eye, let alone answer my question. \n\n\"You people disgust me,\" Casimir spat out in an unnaturally deep and gruff voice. \n\n*Oh dear God.*\n\n\"You don't know what you're doing,\" he went on, sounding like the bad cop from a movie. \"People have died because of you, and yet here you are, pretending like nothing's wrong.\"\n\n*What the hell was he doing?* I tried motioning for him to shut up, but he didn't react.\n\n\"So what's it gonna be? Either you speak up and we talk this out, and maybe my sister will have mercy on you; or you keep quiet and all three of you will face the consequences.\"\n\n*Fuck's sake, he was making it sound like a death threat.*\n\n\"People are dead! Lives have been lost because of you! You're scum, you hear me! Sc—\"\n\nI took a quick step forward, covering my brother's mouth and pulling him aside. The three guards turned to look after us in confusion as I dragged him into the adjacent room. \"What are you doing?\" I hissed. \"Two of those guys likely don't even know what we're talking about! I was hoping they'd keep working here after this whole thing is over! And I'm not keen on a lawsuit.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to help,\" Cas replied innocently.\n\n\"Less of that, please.\"\n\nI returned into the living room by myself. Safe to say my three suspects didn't feel all too cooperative after this, and I basically just apologized and told them to go back to whatever they'd been doing. \n\nNow, we *were* going to try and see if we could get answers from the cameras somehow, but after I found that note on my dresser this afternoon, I'm not sure I should proceed with my investigation anymore. It was there when I got up from my impromptu nap.\n\n*\"If you don't leave this be, I'm going to kill the white rabbit.\"*\n\nThe dread I felt upon reading these words was near paralyzing. For a moment, all I could do was stand there, mouth agape, clutching the piece of paper with trembling fingers.\n\n\"Um… Cas? Cas!\" \n\nMy throat had gone bone dry; but I managed to grit out my brother's name. He was there in a heartbeat and only had to take one look at the note to tell what was wrong. He instantly pulled me into a hug, pressing my cheek against his chest. \n\n\"No one's gonna kill the rabbit,\" he said softly. “We’ll fix this, we’ll figure out who’s been playing us and then we’ll get it back. Think of it this way; it’s a great opportunity! You haven’t been this close to finding the rabbit in ages.”\n\nHe had a point. Part of me had already given up on it altogether. Now, you’re probably kind of confused. Nobody except myself and those close to me could ever possibly understand why this message terrified me so. Bear with me, I’ll try to explain.\n\nFirst, a couple things about the human soul. The soul is, contrary to popular belief, separated from our consciousness. At night, when we sleep, it sometimes leaves our body to roam free and wander around, most often in the shape of an animal or an insect. The animal your soul presents as doesn't have anything to do with you as a person; it moreso symbolizes a hidden or suppressed desire you might have buried somewhere in the back of your mind. Normally, the soul returns before you wake up. Trouble arises when it doesn't. Your soul doesn't define you, you can live without it, but it *is* a part of you. When it's gone, you can tell. It leaves a hole somewhere inside you, and let me assure you that you're going to miss it like a phantom limb. \n\nIt's not like you're unfeeling and emotionless without it, but it will all seem a lot duller and tamer than before. You'll often find yourself feeling weirdly disconnected from your surroundings, your own body even, for the soul often acts as a bridge between your consciousness and your physical form. You'll still be able to feel grief and happiness, but it will never be the same as it was when your soul was still inside you. It will all feel indescribably surreal and just… off. Something's always going to be missing, even outwardly. \n\nYour eyes will look rather lifeless to others.\n\nNow, there can be a lot of reasons your soul isn't coming back to you. Maybe it got lost on one of its journeys. Maybe it's just tired of your shit. Or maybe something happened to it.\n\nWhen I was sixteen, going on seventeen, we acquired an unwanted houseguest. Mom could tell it was a haunting from the very first time we heard the thumping down in the basement at night. She was sitting on my bed with me—we had been immersed in a game of cards just a moment ago. \n\n\"Did you hear that?\" I asked her. \n\n\"Yeah,\" she said quietly, her eyes darting around the room as she drew closer to me. \n\n\"The doors are locked, right? You think someone's broken in?\"\n\n\"No way, not… not *broken in*.\" \n\nWe listened closely, only to hear a dull clatter that sounded like items being knocked off a shelf. The noise was followed by a rhythmic banging, like somebody was bashing the end of a broomstick against the basement ceiling. \n\nDad dropped in shortly after, asking if we had any idea what that ruckus was. My mother merely grinned. \"Why, I guess it's some kinda ghost, no?\" Giving me a short nod and pointing at the cards in my hand, she added, \"Your turn, baby.\"\n\n\"Ania, I'm not taking this shit, I wanna sleep. Go downstairs and deal with it!\" Dad told her sternly.\n\n\"Ah… no.\" Mom shook her head.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"First off, don't speak to me like that in front of my daughter. If this bothers you, take care of it yourself, you coward,\" Mom replied nonchalantly, raising a haughty brow at him. She had become great at getting under his skin over the last couple years.\n\nDad made a face like a fish gasping for air. Without saying another word, he turned on his heel. We heard him slam the door to the master bedroom seconds later.\n\n\"Now he's pissed. Ah, well.\" Mom smiled sweetly. \"Where were we?\"\n\n\"*Mom!*\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Are you for real? There's a ghost downstairs, I'm scared now!\" I couldn't believe I had to explain this to her. \n\n\"But there's no need for that! Like you said, it's downstairs. Not here.\"\n\n\"Well, what if it comes upstairs?\"\n\n\"We'll worry about that when it happens.\"\n\nI lay wide awake that night. You'd think with everything I'd already seen up to that point, I would have lost some of my apprehensions, but I find that when it comes to the supernatural, it's only healthy to stay cautious. I still get the shivers even now when something goes bump in the night, and I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nThe noises in the basement didn't cease, and each one made me twitch and shudder. Somehow, this was much worse than the door-slamming yule lad. It felt distinctly more disconcerting. \n\nThe following day at the breakfast table, I was so puffed up and sleep-deprived that I couldn't swallow a single bite. I begged and pleaded with my mother to somehow take care of the problem, but all she had to offer were pointless words of reassurance. \n\n\"That's the thing about poltergeists, honey. If you take them seriously, you're giving them what they want. Just don't let it get to you,\" she told me.\n\nThe following night was even worse though. The noises had moved up onto the ground floor, and whatever was causing them had absolutely wrecked our kitchen and living room. The trash can had been knocked over, books were lying on the floor beneath their shelf, plates and glasses had been shattered. On top of that, my younger siblings were now just as terrified as me, so Dad became a lot more insistent about it. \n\nMom finally agreed to check out the goings-on, asking me if I wanted to stay up with her in wait for the ghost. I wouldn't be able to sleep anyways, so I figured I might as well. We prepared cleansing salt and sage which we would utilize to purify the room once the spirit would appear. My mother insisted that she was the one who'd deploy these defences as I was too inexperienced. She squeezed herself into one of the kitchen cupboards—short and slim as she was, she actually fit in entirely. I hid under the sofa, legs stretched out and belly pressed to the ground. \n\nWe waited for what felt like an eternity, a giddy kind of excitement keeping us both awake. I was still just as afraid, but something about secretly expecting the haunting to happen was really thrilling. It did happen, and none too late. Around midnight was when the first pots and pans started clanging together. My heart rate quickened instantly and I dug my teeth into my lower lip. The air in the room suddenly seemed to jitter as ragged breaths and an eerie wheezing sound rang out from the kitchen. My entire body tensed in fearful anticipation; I was filled with a nervous energy that made me feel like I was about to explode. \n\nFloorboards creaked as footsteps started moving towards the living room area. I had expected Mom to use her cleansing salt at this point, so I was a bit confused as to why she was letting the ghost proceed. I admittedly couldn't see very much from my hiding place, but I could tell it definitely wasn't my mother coming out of her spot—the steps sounded weird and *wrong*. Peeking out into the darkness, I could make out a pair of unnaturally thin legs moving about in the room. They were extremely unsettling to look at, all gnarled and bony. Perhaps we'd been wrong about this entity. Granted, I'd never seen a poltergeist before, but this was a much more physical form than I'd imagined one to possess. \n\nThe legs started dragging closer, and that's when I realized that they ended in big, pointy chicken claws instead of feet. This was definitely not a ghost. \n\nCold sweat broke out on my forehead as my mind started racing with thoughts about what could have possibly found its way into our home. Mom had most likely already realized we'd made a mistake and that was why she was staying in hiding. The creature started stoming around so heavily that the porcelain on the shelves started jangling. The thing began to jump all across the floor, kicking down chairs and eventually flipping our table. The bangs and crashes were loud enough to make me wince each time and its hopping made the floor shudder beneath me. \n\nI was too afraid to keep watching, opting to press my eyes shut and block out the noise instead. I really shouldn't have done that, for I didn't realize in time that the creature had moved behind my sofa. Before I knew it, I felt long fingers gripping my ankles. I let out a sharp cry of fear as I was dragged across the floor, out from under the sofa and flung into the air. I landed painfully on my back, whimpering as I struggled to push myself back up only to find myself facing a grotesque-looking entity.\n\nIt was a hunchbacked, haggard old woman with a large chicken beak smack in the middle of her ghastly face. I cried out, but she was upon me within the blink of an eye, grabbing me by the collar and forcefully pulling me to my feet. Suddenly, I heard a sharp scream of fury—my mother had come tumbling out of the cupboard and was now charging at the creature from the side, trying to pry her away from me. \n\n\"Get your hands off my daughter, you dirty old crone!\" she yelled, reaching right up to the monster's eyes as if to gouge them out. \n\nThe creature let go of me and staggered backwards. My mother rushed right to my side, wrapping both arms around me as she glared daggers at this bizarre-looking thing. For a few seconds, all was silent.\n\n\"Get out of my house, Kikimora!\" Mom said in a steely, low voice.\n\nThe old woman let out something akin to a giggle; a high-pitched, uncanny sound that sent chills down my spine. Then, she disappeared, simply vanishing into thin air. \n\nMy mother's chest was heaving. \"This isn't over,\" she mumbled. It wasn't a threat. It was a statement.\n\n\"You mean she's not going away?\" I asked.\n\n\"Worse. Everyone, wake up!\" she shouted, raising her voice as she began stomping up the stairs. \"Honey, get me a marker or something.\"\n\nMy mother ordered us to draw crosses on the other sides of our pillows, then sent us back to sleep while staying up to guard the upper floor. I came to relieve her from duty an hour later, after I'd calmed down and taken a little power nap.\n\n\"So?\" I asked as I helped her up from her seat by the staircase.\n\n\"That's no poltergeist,\" Mom explained, rubbing her eyes. \"It's a Kikimora. The domestic kind. Wants to drive people insane to chase them out of their houses. When she's in a really bad mood, she'll try to eat their souls.\"\n\nMom had already explained the whole soul-thing to me, so I knew to be frightened. \"The crosses on our pillows, will they protect us?\" \n\n\"Yeah, don't worry. So long as you're asleep in bed, you'll be fine.\"\n\nI took her seat and started waiting. There hadn't been any noises since our face-to-face encounter earlier. Maybe the Kikimora was hiding somewhere, watching me. The thought alone sent chills down my spine. As the minutes seeped by, I was getting increasingly tired. It wasn't easy fending off sleep. I tried to recall the image of the creepy old chicken woman, and just when I thought my mind was finally occupied enough to stay clear, I heard a sharp scream and my eyes flew open. \n\n*Wait, had I been dozing this entire time?*\n\nI didn't have much time to ponder that, though. My little sister Julia was standing in the hallway, a plastic cup lying in a pool of milk at her feet. She was pointing at the window across from us, her mouth agape. My parents came running to check on us, and immediately Julia started to babble. The poor thing was scared out of her mind.\n\n\"There was this white rabbit… A ghost rabbit! It was just hopping along and then this chicken woman came and she tried to catch it! They were over there, and I was right here, but they didn't notice me!\"\n\n\"A ghost rabbit,\" my father repeated.\n\nMom had gone very pale.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Julia went on. \"But the rabbit jumped out the window just in time! Right on through, like it was open.\"\n\nMy mother slowly began walking over to me. \"Honey, did you fall asleep?\" she inquired. \n\nI didn't reply, merely stared up at her with wide eyes. \"Something's different.\"\n\nIn the week that followed, we tried to chase away the Kikimora by hanging various charms around the house. She stopped bothering us eventually, but the ghost rabbit never returned. My mom kept telling me my soul would one day find its way back to me, but it's been so long since then. I actually started convincing myself that I'm alright, and most days, I'm actually unaware of the disconnect, but even so, something is missing and I've always known it.\n\nBack to the present—Cas and I have had a long talk, and we've decided that if there's a chance I could have my soul back, we need to take it. We need help though, from someone who not only knows their way around the forest, but around souls and all that spiritual stuff. And to my great dismay, I know only one person who fits that scheme. \n\nJacek of the old black mill.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "\n\nDo you believe in the supernatural and the things that go bump in the night.\nI surely didn't until my wife was acting unusual. Let me start from the beginning for more context. It was late winter night and my wife and I were heading to our cabin in the middle of the Canadian woods near lake Chandos about five miles away from the nearby settlement. It's a nice secluded oak tavern no different to any you see in the movies,  surrounded by beautiful pine trees as far as the eye can see, with the lake only 500 yards from the front of the tavern. During this time of the year the lake is frozen due to the extreme cold but still showing its natural beauty.\n 'are we there yet'\nMy wife called out frustrated, \nAlmost there' I retorted, barely holding my own frustration. It had been a long 5 hour trip and the heater was not working properly causing our trip to be bitter and cold. From when we left  our summer place early in the afternoon traveling was not the easiest during this time, we had to take many road detoures adding many hours to our journey. Plus my wife's constant belittling of me made the journey a lot more harder than it was.\nLook out! \nI was so busy in my own thoughts that the sudden shouting took me out of my haze. I slammed on the brakes snaking my head onto the wheel, I looked up standing in my Beames was a deer  meters from my hood. I look Up from the wheel and I saw the deer's face staring at me. I felt  An odd sensation before me. A cold mocking and sadistic tone emanating from those cold and lifeless black eyes reflecting my two car beams in those eyes. It perked up and ran off into the void of the night\nDan!\nDan!\nI was shot back and heard my wife screaming at me\n'What the fuck dan you almost got us killed with your incompetent driving'.\nSorry \nSorry? Is that all you got to say sorry, fuck me.\nShe slapped me over the head gesturing not to that again\nOw!\nI turned to face her but something caught my eyes. Something in the distance is heading straight towards us.\n'Whats the matter now you pale as a fucking ghost'? She snarkly said I pointed out the 'window on her side and she looked \n'There's nothing there dumbass'\n'Could I be imaging those two glowing eyes, there's no way I can't just imagine them, 'they were just there?' \n'Can you turn on the engine we still got 30 min before we get to our cabin she retorted angrily'\nShe punched me and I got out of my daze. \nI started up the engine and headed off toward our cabin. Still pondering the two glowing eyes I saw. The snow was getting heavier making it harder to see the road. \nLuckily we made it to the cabin without any more run in with wildlife or those glowing eyes. Before the snow really turned on us we ran into our cabin and quickly closed the door behind us\n\n'Finally  here' I exclaimed happily about the long five hour drive being over with.\n almost killing us my wife muttered as she was walking up the stairs not even glancing back at me\n'I'll start the fire' \nNo reassuring reads came from my wife except a grunt.\n\nI sighed as I headed towards the cabin  fire pit. The cabin wasn't the best, it was passed down from my father and so on so it was kinda a family heirloom. My wife doesn't see the beauty as she huffs and heaves her luggage towards the upstairs bedroom. As I lit the fire I noticed an uneasy feeling like the whole room felt colder than the outside. It felt like something was watching me peering into the depths of my soul. This unnerving feeling brought chills to my spine. I looked over to make sure my wife was okay, she had made up to  her room, I thought to myself. I huffed in relief. I ignored my match and whatcha as the fire engulfed the logs turning brown from black. The light from the fire flickers, making my shadow dance on the back wall. I stood up and turned around and I stood frozen. I turned as white as a ghost and before me were two eyes staring at me the same two starry white eyes I saw a mere moment earlier that nearly caused me to crash that eye.\nMy stomach dropped and all my fears came true. Staring down the two eyes I couldn't move I was frozen in panic the whole world stood still that very instant. I was too afraid to move. I don't want to provoke the creature whatever it was standing outside my window. The only thing that broke my stance was my wife screaming at me. The eyes darted around my living room to find the source and quickly vanished as a loud scream echoed throughout the cabin. I ran up to see my wife throwing the lamp at me screaming as I entered the bedroom screaming  about god knows what this. The lamp hit my face causing blood to rush down my face. My wife was screaming at me about something but I couldn't focus. All I could focus on was the splitting headache and the blood trickling down my face. I looked at her in pure anger.\n'What' I screamed\nShe pulled out a sheet of paper\n''What do you mean what!'' she hissed\n''You're divorcing me on our trip?'\n\n''17 years I put up with this 17 long years you treated me with disrespect''.\n\"Fuck of and die you worthless shit you've never down anything for me!\"\nWith those stinging words I felt my world shatter all these times. She never loved me. I knew we were growing distant after our attempt at a child but hearing those words brought pain.\nI turned around and ran down the stairs\nTowards my car I got in and drove All the while my wife was cursing and throwing abusive slurls at me. The nearest town  was about a five mile 30min trip in this weather. That's all the time I needed to clear my head. I made it to town just before 8pm. I headed towards the bar. It was a rudimentary and old style bar resembling a 1950 bar. It was a hell a lot better being here than at my house at the moment. The atmosphere was very welcoming. I went into the bar and ordered a double shot of whisky with chips. The first thing I noticed about this bar wasn't the decor resembling the 50s, it was the giant skull perched up on the bar table. I look Up at it with awe and fear. Know that such a creature could easily hunt us down. \n\"It's called the wendigo an native monster to this parts\"\nI looked around and saw a person sitting alone.\n\"Pardon me?\"\n\"It's a wendigo skull\"\n\"I looked back in amazement\" \n\"But I thought these creatures were stuff of legends\" do they still exist?\n\"Very much if you see two glowing eyes \nYour fate is sealed\" the old geyser grunted \n\"Sounds like a load of bullsit to me\"\nHe looked at me with a grumpy expression and stood up.\n\"Well boy is this bullshit to you\"\nHe lifted up his shirt to reveal 3 massive claw marks on his stomach.\nI looked wide eyed at him. I couldn't ''believe what I'm seeing.\n\"A-are you sure it wasn't a bear claws?\" I stammered\n\"No bears hibernate during these time easy prey for those things\"\nI looked back at the skull and into those empty black sockets.\n\"Shit shit!\" \n\"What's up boy?\"\n\"You said that wendigo eyes glow white right\"?\n\"Yes\" he retorted back\n\"My wife is in a lot of danger\"\n\"Come again lad\"\n\"On the way here I nearly hit a dear and when I looked out I saw two glowing eyes but my wife didn't, the next incident was when I was lighting the flame and out the window\"\n\n\"Well not boy you better drive home quickly\"\nI ran out of the bar as quickly as I could not worrying about the seatbelt as I sped off. All I could worry about is my wife. My  wife ahri. I couldn't get the thought of her dead on the couch with her guts ripped out or her head ripped off. All I could do was speed down the road. I hit 90 miles per hour. I could feel my car shaking as it wasn't meant to go this fast but that wasn't the least of my concern. \nMy face went pale as I drove up the drive and saw big marks on the ground leading up the way toward the cabin. I got my flashlight and ran through the blistering cold to see the door off its hinges. My heart sank when I saw the state of the door. I moved the door and all of my colour drained from my body. My home was wrecked there when there were signs of a fight and struggle. Blood was covering the floor in one corner and up the wall. I feared the worst. My wife may have been slaughtered by a wendigo. I looked around and my heart jumped when I heard \n\"Dan?\"\nI saw Ahri in the corner of the room shaking uncontrollably. \n\"Ahri are you alright'\n\"Yes love I'm alright, a giant moose had smashed its way in\".  \nI looked at her in disbelief and towards the door. \n\"How can a moose do that?\"\nPuzzled at the claw marks on the door no moose could even produce those marks let alone fit in this cabin.\nI looked at ahri and she had passed out\nNot wanting to push it any further I grabbed my wife and headed up towards  our bedroom and laid her onto our bed. I looked back at her in confusion why she had lied about the moose attack and how there was so much blood everywhere. I god the blood that's gonna take a while I thought to myself. Dreading tomorrow house choir. Out in the dark forest I pondered to myself what nightmare lay out there and how long they had been here. I heard my wife rustling on the covers, quickly covering her and extinguished the light.\n\nThat night I didn't get much sleep as our incident at the bar and running home to find a bloody mess left me with so many unanswered questions. Why did my wife lie to me was that skull truly a wendigo. I finally got to sleep around 1am. But that was short lived as I suffer from nightmares and this day didn't help. \nI woke up to the smell of eggs and bacon simmering through the house. Drawn to the smell I headed downstairs to see my wife singing a happy tune and smiling. I took one step and she perked around so quick. \n\"Morning darling I cooked you breakfast\"\n\"Uhh thank you I responded confused\"\nI pulled my chair out from the table to sit down. As I was doing so my wife walked up and placed the plate and gave me a kiss. \n\nI tried to hide my shock and confusion but my face betrayed me.\n\"What's wrong dear?\" Ahri said with a puzzled look.\n\"Is the eggs too runny or the bacon too burnt?\".\n\"No no there perfect in just surprised that your up this early\" I lied\n\"Oh really why's that?\"she retorted\n\"Well you usually up after me dear\" I quickly replied not wanting her to see the confusion and terror on my face while I sipped my coffee. \n\"Is that so she giggled\" \n\"I guessed I wanted to cook you breakfast\" she said smiling.\nAs I was eating I thought back to the events of last night.\n\"So babe about last night?\"\nDon't worry about it, I cleaned and fixed the door while you were out cold.\nI looked stunned and looked at the entrance of the cabin near the fireplace. What she said was true: the door looked brand new and on its hinges and there was no sight of blood anywhere. It looked like it was cleaned by a clean up crew.\n\"What how?\"\nShe put a finger on my lips\n \"don't worry,\" she whispered.\nShe got up from her chair and headed over to the cabin to pull a box full of bandages and medicine.\n\"I notice that you got a nasty scratch on your head, let me help you clean and dress your wound love then we go out to the lake.\"\n\nI held my terror in as she was cleaning and dressing my wound. I forgot all about last night with everything going on but why did she not remember throwing a lamp at my head and screaming at me. This is strange what's going on.\n \"The divorce paper I\" screamed.\nAhri looked at me in sadness.\n\"Can you please get dressed and meet me by the lake\" quivering under her lips.\nI saw the sadness in her eyes and I nodded to reply to her question.\n\nIt took me longer to get dressed with so many thoughts going through me. I ran outside to see arhi standing by the front porch looking towards the lake.\nLet go, she said quietly.\n\nThe soft crunch of snow under our feet did not ease the atmosphere between us as we slowly walked. She then stopped and looked at me.\n\n\"Babe, why do you want a divorce?\"\nThat question made me slipp with my words as I tried to find an answer. Doesn't she remember the 17 years she had treated me like shit and the abuse she did. I was beyond comprehension filled with rage at that question. But before I answered she put a hand out to hold mine.\nThe moment her hand mine I felt the coldness of her hand. It was unnatural.\n\nHer hands shouldn't have been that cold; they should be frostbitten. But yet they are beautiful and delicate.\nI flinched and pulled my hand away.\nShe looked at me teary eyed and knelt onto the ground. \n\n\"Please give me another chance. She said, `` I love you so very much!\"\n\nI looked at her kneeling on the ground wailing as if she lost the most important thing in her life. I need time to think about this. I picked up the paper and put them in my pocket and walked off not saying a word to my wife.\nShe looked up crying.\nI walked back into the cabin and looked around to see that last night's incident was totally gone. I sat in the coach thinking about the past 24 hours. When I suddenly dozed off.\n\nBy the time I woke up I saw my wife staring at me from the door handle. Her expression was of nothing. The truth was that it freaked me out a bit.\nShe walked past me not saying a word and headed straight up to our bedroom.\nTurning back towards the fireplace I saw that the log had been put out and scattered around.\n\nI got up and put the logs back in the fireplace when I heard what sounded like a deer coming from the woods. Scared me a bit but then the most awful and gut wrenching sound replied. The only way I can describe it is that it sounded like you took a recording of a deer and slowed and added reverb to it then you sped up that slowed down reverb repeating  many times till it doesn't sound like a deer anymore.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShe goes out hunting when I'm asleep\nI see blood trails around our house",

        "text": "*Beep… beep… beep…*\n\nMy vision blurred when I first opened my eyes to see the tiled ceiling. I was far too out of it to realize where I was. Gazing around the room, I saw the television fastened to the wall, two ugly green, square chairs, and the blinds down on the black framed window. Where am I? How did I get here? \n\nWhen I went to move my arm, I felt it – a tube fastened into my wrist, and my skin began to crawl. *Not here* was the only thought that crossed my mind. \n\n*Beep, beep, beep…*\n\nThe heart monitor quickened when, in shock, I threw off the thin blankets and sheets to reveal myself in a dotted hospital gown, legs covered in cuts and bruises. Immediately, I was hit by a wave of tiredness, and I settled back down into the bed, cursing under my breath, “Shit.”\n\nIt hurt to even say, and upon moving my mouth, I felt the tube in my throat. I croaked, reaching up to feel where they’d forced a feeding tube into my mouth. My fingers touched where it hooked in my nose, and I could feel the tears welling in my eyes. Not this. I’d worked so hard to achieve death, and now they’re nursing me back to life. \n\nDesperation clawed in my mind. I felt like an animal trapped, yet most would be thankful they survived taking several handfuls of pills. Most people would view this as a second chance at life. Not me. I’ve been done with life for some time, and not a single doctor, nurse, psychiatrist, or therapist can understand why. \n\nMy body was too weak to move. I attempted to lift myself out of bed but fell back before I could even get myself lifted. My body was emaciated, skin and bones, and I just let out a tiny cry from my sore throat. *I did this*, I thought to myself as I again attempted to lift myself up from the bed, pushing tubes away. *And now I’m stuck recovering again.*\n\n*Why?* I thought to myself. *Why won’t it just let me die?*\n\n“You’re not supposed to be moving.” I looked up to see a blonde nurse standing in the doorway to my empty room. She gripped a clipboard in her hands, and her round face showed concern. \n\nI simply rolled my eyes and attempted again to get up again. She ran to my side almost instantly, pale hands clasping my bony shoulders. I squirmed, trying to get away from her, but my state made it impossible to even fight back. She pushed me back and begged, “Please, calm down.” \n\nI refused to even look at her. My brown eyes rested on the blinds while I pursed my lips, breathing heavily. I felt her checking some tubing and machinery, listening to the clattering going on beside me. She placed a blood-pressure cuff on me. I didn’t even flinch, fighting back the tears lingering. My chest was tight. \n\nWhile that was happening, she outstretched the thermometer to me. I refused it at first and then relented, realizing there was no point in even fighting this. I’m tubed, I’m hydrated, and I’m alive. How wonderful. \n\nAfter taking my vitals, she gently said, “I know it must be a shock. You’re lucky to be alive. Your name is London? My name is Kelsey. I’m going to be your nurse for tonight.” \n\nI didn’t reply, still refusing to look at her. She couldn’t fathom how badly I wanted to rip this stupid tubing out of my throat and throw it at her. After a few seconds of silence, she took the hint and decided to leave. Leaving the door cracked to my room, I breathed a sigh of both frustration and relief and settled down, staring at the tiled ceiling, and plotting how in the hell to get out of here. \n\nObviously, this is not my first rodeo in a situation like this. I’ve attempted numerous times to take my life in my own hands, as I call it. I’ve been hospitalized several times before this, at least five, and each time I come out the same – unchanged and on a different set of pills and therapy practices.\n\nNothing works. I knew this would be no different. I took five bottles of pain killers. I’m about 96 lbs, 5’6”. I searched for an answer for how I’m still alive while I lay in that bed with the beeping in my ears, stifling back tears of true frustration. I do not want this. I crave death.\n\nMost would say this is a miracle. I fail to see how. I’m in constant peril. Even then, I waited for it, listening intently. I knew it lurked beneath the surface of my subconscious, watching and waiting and laughing at every little mistake I ever made. It never slept – no need for it, I assume. Plaguing my mind, it hissed when it spoke, words so heavy yet pillow-like at the same time, billowing and yet whispering. \n\nA true monster existed inside my head, and not a single soul believed me. \n\n“London?!” \n\nI heard the familiar voice ring out to me, and I turned to see my mom standing in the doorway. *Great* I thought to myself. *Now this.*\n\n“London… oh thank goodness you’re alive!” She walked in and sat in one of the puke green chairs off to the side. Pushing her burnet hair out of her brown eyes, she continued, voice cracking. “Look at you!” \n\nI couldn’t even look at her as I fought back tears. My eyes rested above her head to give her the illusion I was looking at her. The words caught in my throat as I fought back my own sadness. She could never understand. \n\n“Mom…” I finally muttered as my face twisted into a grimace of despair. \n\n“You’re just… you’re just bones!” She covered her mouth with a pale hand, fingernails painted red. I could tell she, too, was holding back how she felt. “What have you done to yourself?!” \n\nHer demand fell out of her mouth and hit me right in throat. A single tear fled down my face, and I had to avert my gaze while my chin trembled. Composing myself quickly, I turned back to her, and, heaving a sigh, my words wobbled out. “Y-you wouldn’t understand.”\n\n“How… how could I not understand?!” \n\nI flinched. I looked her dead in the eyes, a rage boiling inside my chest. “I have to.”\n\n“You have to what?” She appeared confused, and I knew we were about to fight. \n\n“It’s inside me.” \n\n“Not this again.” \n\nYup, we were about to fight. I threw my gaze back to the window as another tear escaped my left eye, running down my cheek with speed. My words caught in my throat again as I swallowed the ever-growing lump. *I cannot handle this*. I thought. \n\nAnd then, it happened as it always does. My mom cried out, “London, you’ve completely destroyed yourself over this. I haven’t seen you in 6 months, and now look at you. You know it’s not real.” \n\nAs she spoke these words, a voice in my head mirrored it perfectly, predicting what she’d say. I squirmed. *You son of a bitch* I thought to myself, gritting my teeth as I wriggled around in my bed. That’s when I ripped the IV from my arm. \n\nEverything that followed is just a haze. I remember pleading, “You don’t understand.” I sat up in bed. My mom had already jumped up from her chair and ran to my side. She pushed me back into bed, begging me to stay. \n\n*… Beeeeeeep…*\n\nI ripped the heart monitor off of me, teeth tightly together while I groaned. I breathed heavily as I heard it ring out. It made my skin crawl. \n\n***You’re alive, aren’t you?*** \n\n“Mom, please,” I remember begging. My consciousness was fading when I watched Kelsey enter the room. \n\n“Please… she’s too weak!” \n\nMy mom cried, “She’s ripping everything out!” \n\n***You can’t escape me.*** The monster loved predicting what other people would say. That’s how I knew it existed separate from me. \n\n“***Please cooperate with me here!***” both the voice and Kelsey called. I just fell back into my bed, emaciated, and let it happen. I had no choice. I was too weak to fight. \n\nAnd as I faded out, I could hear that thing cackling. No words, just laughter. It shook me to the core. That’s when I knew—it planed this.",

        "text": "Okay, so I have this urge to post this here. I' not sure what else to do. It just feels like i have to or something bad will happen to me. Okay, so a few days ago, I was rummaging through my friend's attic when I stumbled upon a pile of paper. I picked them up and noticed that they were the pages of a screenplay. I had no idea why my friend would have these, especially since he wasn't a huge reader, and these pages looked old. Like they had dust and shit all over them. They were in pretty shit shape. \n\nMy friend had gone missing a few days ago, and I had been searching his house for any clues as to what had happened. I thought that this screenplay might be connected to his disappearance, weird connection, I know...I just had a weird feeling about it. I had to find out what it was all about. \n\nSo I brought the pages back home to my apartment and layer them out across a desk I have in my bedroom. The air felt weird, like a strange chill had passed over the room. I wasn't sure what had come over me, but suddenly I felt this desire and need to read these pages. So I picked up the pages and began to read through them. As I read through them I noticed a strange chill come over me, and my body went numb. \n\nI didn't much care for this feeling, but I kept reading anyways. It was one of the stranger things I've ever read, and I've read some weird ass shit. This manuscript was the pilot to some TV show made in the 70s called \"Estate Blues\". I'm not really sure what the show was supposed to be about, but it wasn't like any show I've ever seen or heard of. Sort of like a Lovecraftian horror show. \n\nAnyways, as I put the down the pages a few hours ago and lay in bed now, I feel this strange need to post them here. I really can't explain it, but I felt like if I don't some strange darkness will overtake my life. \n\nI don't think reading the pages will do anybody any harm, so I'm sure it's not a big deal. Plus, if anybody has heard of this show before maybe they can clue me in on it. \n\nEnough of my rambling. Here's the manuscript:\n\nEstate Blues Pilot. \"Pilot\" 10/03/1972\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nEXT.

        "author": "Spike1117",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105im6z/cousin_jerry/",
        "text": "I've never liked my cousin Jerry. When I was very young, my father died in an accident, and my mother was hard pressed to provide for us and raise me. We ended up moving into the same apartment complex as her sister. Whenever she had to work long hours, which was very frequent, my aunt and uncle would watch me, so I ended up spending much of my time in their apartment, along with their son, my cousin Jerry.\n\nTo say Jerry was a strange kid would be an understatement. He never spoke much, and most of the time he was around he would just stare at me with a wry smile. The only times he would interact with me is when he had something to show me, which would run the gamut from a spider whose legs he had plucked off to pornographic sites he discovered. I got nervous when he had something to show me, because I knew it would probably be disturbing and inappropriate, but being a kid, morbid curiosity would always get the better of me. \n\nHe wasn't much better at the school we went to, and he would often get in trouble. Most of the kids knew to avoid him, especially from the grades below, many of whom he had terrorized on the playground. My aunt and uncle tried to punish and correct him, but to no real avail. Yell at him, take his things away, ground him, everything just seemed to run off him like water. He never cried, or showed really any other emotion than hints of pleasure and satisfaction whenever he would engage in one of his devious endeavors. Otherwise, he might as well have been a walking corpse. \n\nAround the time I was 14, my mother had a major breakthrough in her career and started making much more money while having considerably more free time. Because of this, we ended up moving out of the city the apartment complex was in, a couple hours south.\n\nAfter that I rarely saw Jerry, and I sort of forgot about him. However, I continued being close with my uncle, Arnold, and would frequently call him. He was the only real father figure I had growing up, and he and my aunt had taken great care of me when my mom and I were struggling.\n\nEventually I wound up becoming a locksmith and moving back into the city, where I’ve been for quite some time. About two months ago, my aunt sadly passed. By this point, my uncle had numerous health issues, and was bound to a wheelchair. Without my aunt to help take care, my uncle was going to have to move into a care facility. \n\nWell, he would've, if Jerry hadn't volunteered to take him in. When I first heard that, I was surprised. Last I had heard of Jerry, he had moved away straight out of high school and had minimal contact with my aunt and uncle. Even at my aunt's funeral, all he did was sit in the back and leave promptly when it was over. \n\nApparently, he was working as a garage repairman about thirty minutes west of the city, and had managed to make a decent amount of money in various investments. He had gotten a small two-story house, and was willing to let Uncle Arnold move in with him. \n\nI helped Arnold pack up his things, and offered to drive him out to Jerry's, which he accepted. During the ride, he admitted that he knew Jerry was not a normal kid and that he could never really connect with him. He said he tried his best to raise up Jerry right but nothing ever quite clicked, and by the time Jerry moved out, they barely spoke to one another. He said he was hopeful that maybe Jerry had changed out in the world and that they could have a fresh start and build a new bond.\n\nWhen we got to Jerry's, I wheeled Arnold to the door. Jerry came out, with that same blank yet simultaneously intense look I remembered. The inside of his house was dim and bare from what I could see. He asked me to unload everything onto the lawn and said he would take care of it from there. I offered to help carry stuff in, but he was oddly insistent that he could get everything inside himself. He then said he was going to get Arnold set inside, and told him to say goodbye to me. After we had hugged, I watched Jerry wheel him to the basement door, where I could see a crude plywood ramp was built leading down the stairs. \n\nAfter I had unloaded everything and left, I couldn't shake a strange feeling that something was off. I knew it was going to be awkward no matter what, but the way Jerry seemed to be in a rush to get me to leave and not even inviting me in the house was more than just weird. I figured Jerry had something to hide, though what exactly that was I had few guesses. \n\nWhen things really started to seem worrying, though, is when neither me or my mom could even get ahold of Arnold. His cell service was abruptly terminated, and if you called Jerry to ask to talk to Arnold, he would say Arnold was busy or didn't feel like talking, and that's if Jerry even answered at all. This was completely unlike Arnold. Even in his older age, he was almost always available to talk and was quite warm and understanding. It made no sense that abruptly he would cut off the rest of his family and isolate himself like that. \n\nIt didn't take long for me to suspect Jerry was up to something sinister. I figured everything added up to some form of elder abuse. For him to suddenly offer to care for his dad whom he had practically no relationship with, and for Arnold to stop talking to my mom and I was too big of a coincidence, especially given his cruel tendencies growing up. \n\nTalking with my mom, she had her concerns too, but thought there wasn't much we could do about it. That didn't sit right with me. All I had were suspicions, but I was convinced there was foul play. \n\nThinking it would be useless to go to police with unfounded claims, I took matters into my own hands. In my free time I began tracking Jerry, driving by his house and following him. I learned what days and times he left his house for work, to get groceries, and so on, building a schedule of when he was gone. I resolved that I was going to break in and check on Arnold. I knew it would be illegal and there could be some pretty serious repercussions if I was caught, but I just had to see that my uncle was okay. If he wasn't, then I could get him out of there and we could figure things out from there. \n\nSo, about a month ago, I drove to Jerry's house, and watched him leave for work. I quickly got going on his lock, having brought my own kit. I admittedly was nervous; there was the chance that either Jerry would come back earlier than expected, or a neighbor would see me picking his lock and call it in. Luckily, though, it didn’t take long for me to get the door unlocked, and I speedily slipped inside.\n\nThe house was cold and dark. From what I can tell, all the blinds were drawn. There was no decorations to speak of. No pictures, no artwork, no plants, nothing. Not even furniture, except for a few barebones items like a table and chair. It was honestly unsettling; who could live like this?\n\nI walked towards the basement door, which hung slightly ajar. I flipped the light switch and began walking down the steps. It seemed like he had removed the plywood covering, which further confirmed in my head that foul play was going on. Why would he remove the ramp to where he was keeping Arnold?\n\nAfter a few steps down, though, I was hit with a horrid stench. It was as if I had walked into a cloud of putrid miasma. I stopped for a second, nearly gagging. Then I was hit with a sense of urgency, knowing something now had to be terribly wrong. \n\nI sped down the rest of the stairs, springing into the basement. It looked unfinished, with bare concrete and exposed pipes and all. The smell had gotten worse. There were all sorts of shelves and tools scattered about. There was one dull lightbulb above me, barely illuminating the rest of the room. “Arnold?” I yelled. No reply. \n\nI noticed a table at the far end of the basement, and crept over to it. There was something large and heavy on it, and a pit of fear grew in my stomach. I edged closer and closer, until I realized it was a man, motionless.\n\nI sprinted over to the side of the table, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw it was Arnold. I gasped in horror. He was utterly disfigured, covered in cuts and burns. His arms were amputated at the elbows. There were bits of metal and glass protruding from his chest and torso. \n\nBacking away, I bumped into a shelf, toppling it over and falling with it. It was filled with all kinds of knives and scalpels and saws, which clattered on the ground in a loud cacophony. It was a miracle I didn’t get cut. \n\nLooking up, I could see jars of fluid filled with various bits of flesh. Most of them seemed to be amorphous hunks of skin and muscle, but I thought I could make out an ear.\n\nI got to my feet, my head spinning. I needed to contact the police immediately. I took another look at Arnold, and that’s when I noticed he was breathing, ever so slightly. He was still alive. \n\nWhatever momentary relief that came with that realization was fleeting, as I understood that in some capacity he was aware of the agony being inflicted upon him. At that point, I don’t know if he was in some kind of shock or coma. I can only hope he was.\n\n“I’m going to get you help Arnold!” I yelled, and turned around to make for the stairs. I nearly ran into the barrel of a pistol, pointed square at my head. Stunned, I threw my arms up and started backing away slowly.\n\n“Could never keep your eyes away,” Jerry said. I was too scared to reply, my lips quivering. His lips curled into his signature grin. \n\n“Really didn’t think I knew you would come?” he asked. “Never thought I didn’t notice your car, parked across the street every week, trailing me all over the neighborhood?”\n\nHe stared intently. “Jerry…” I sputtered. “L-let’s ju-“\n\n“Let’s just take it easy,” he said in a cruel, mocking tone. “I’m not going to kill you right now. I wanted you to see this. Just like I always have. I took a risk, a big one. This project… I snagged the opportunity as it came, and it's really payed off. Of course you could’ve tried to report something to the police, but somehow I had a feeling you would come yourself. Lucky I managed to keep him alive this long too, but what can I say, I’m an artist. Well, whaddya think?”\n\nI said nothing, my throat dry and tight. I was drenched in sweat, my heart beating against my ribcage. I couldn’t think of what to do; I couldn’t think at all. He walked over to the wall, where a few gallons of gasoline laid, gun still leveled at me. He kneeled, down, unscrewing the caps, and began to pour them along the floor.\n\n“Go”, he said. “Go call the police. You saw what I wanted you to see.” \n\nI began shuffling towards the stairs as he continued to douse the basement in gasoline. As he emptied a can, he suddenly flung it at me, causing me to break into a panicked sprint for the stairs.\n\nAs soon as my foot hit the first step, there was a deafening bang, and I fell into the staircase. It felt like someone had hit the back of my calf with a bat. Adrenaline flooded my body, and I scrambled up the staircase as best as I could. Every time I tried to stand, I would fall again, so I flung myself forward basically on all fours. \n\nI threw myself onto the main floor, and with all the strength and speed I could muster, made for the front door, which was wide open. I launched myself out of the house and onto his front lawn, sprawling out on my stomach. I quickly flipped around, pushing myself back, and withdrew my cell phone to call 911. I screamed for help repeatedly as my fingers fumbled over the screen. I kept my eyes glued on the house, expecting him to burst out any moment to finish the job. But he never did. \n\nThe next couple of hours are a jumbled mess of chaos in my memory. There were neighbors and police rushing to me. Jerry’s house went up in flames, with firefighters battling the inferno. I was pulled into an ambulance and rushed to a hospital.\n\nThe recovery process- physically and mentally- has been rough. I’ve had to explain multiple times my recounting of events, reliving the terror I felt while also admitting my break-in. My mother is a wreck, maybe even worse off than me. The procedures, legal and all, are still in proceedings.\n\nWhile investigators could not be sure, they concluded it was likely both Arnold and Jerry perished in the fire. They could not find a trace of the bodies, but there was no evidence they found that Jerry had attempted an escape. Even if he had tried, they thought it likely that the blaze might’ve caught him right after he lit it, especially if he had gotten gasoline on his person.\n\nI was willing to accept that. Whatever was so fucked up in his mind, it wasn’t an unreasonable leap that he burned himself with his “project”. I had no idea what twisted Jerry’s psyche into someone who was capable of this depravity, and honestly, I didn’t care, as long as he was dead too.\n\nBut he isn’t. You see, last night, I had a package delivered to my doorstep in the middle of the night. I found it in the morning, on my way to the grocery store.\n\nThe package was strange, just a box covered in paper, with my name written on it. A fear took hold of me as I slowly tore through it. My heart dropped when I saw the contents.\n\nIt had a polaroid of Jerry, standing in the field behind his burnt house. He was flashing that same smile. Below the picture, was a dozen or so tapes, completely unlabeled. \n\nI have no idea what’s on those tapes. I’m sending them in to the police station. I don’t know if they are videos of he did to Arnold, or of him tracking me after, or what. I’m too scared to check for myself. I don’t know what the detectives will make of it. \n\nAll I know is that Jerry is still out in the world, and he knows where I live.",

        "text": "To start things off, I’m not a dog person. So when my grandparents put in their will that they want someone to take care of their 6 year old anatolian shepherd, everyone seemed to point at me to take care of it. Simply because I happen to be the only other person that that dog could tolerate. That dog always barked and ran up to people whenever they walked into my grandparents home. Not in a playful way, but rather in a way where he’s telling them “this is MY house, get out!”. But when I’d come to visit them, he’d sit in the middle of their hallway that led to the bathroom and just… stare. Just staring at me. No barks, no growls; nothing. My grandmother always claimed that that was his way of showing that he respected me. I called bullshit on that, but I never spoke on it. \n\nIt took about three weeks for Mush to adapt to his new home. He knew who I was, didn’t eat as much and when I was at work, he would seem to play with his toys. But when I got home, the house would be silent. I would hear a few click clacks from his nails hitting the wooden floor but otherwise, it almost seemed like I didn’t have my very own dog. When I’d work from home, he would every once and awhile walk into my home office, stare at me, then just sit by the door and continue to give me a stare. I assumed it was because he needed something so when I’d walk towards him and start asking him what he wanted as if he understood me; he’d stand up, take one step back, before sitting down again. It seemed to be an ongoing thing and I learned to just assume that he wanted to watch me. \n\nIt took another week for me to finally build a doggie door for him to play in the backyard. He seemed quite excited for that and I’d like to believe that he became comfortable because of that. He had his own freedom without the need to ask me for stuff and still had a place to come to when he was done chilling in the backyard. \n\nI became closer to him after that too. Something just changed. His demeanor became more light, bubbly and he wagged his tail more often. I began (though I’d never admit it to people I know) to talk in a baby voice around him. He even slept at the end of my bed sometimes. Mush was becoming my best friend without me knowing. When we’d go on walks, he never tug on the leash, he listened to my commands, he would look at me for reassurance whenever he saw other dogs or kids outside. It was like he completely understood what I wanted… \n\nBut, I’m getting too backtrack. After I had installed the doggie door, Mush has been bringing home little… treats to say the least. At first, it was sticks. Small tiny sticks. Then, it was rocks. I thought it was his way of showing gratitude. You know, like what a cat does. I kept all of his little findings in a box and put it in my closet. But then he stopped bringing the little nick nacks. It turned into dead birds, squirrels, any small living thing. Again, I thought it was like a cats behavior. \n\n“Not again, Mush.” I had already seen what he was holding in his mouth. Another fucking bird. Grabbing a glove from the glove box in the kitchen, I put it on and caught it before he could drop it on the ground. “I told you to stop. You understand me right?” I asked, walking towards the back door and opening it. Mush seemed to have followed me as I walked out. It was the third one this week and I’ve already build mini graveyards for these dead animals. Mush though, didn’t seem to grasp that I didn’t want them. As I was digging another hole for the dead bird, I kept talking to him as if he understood a thing I was saying. “No more animals” this, and “I don’t want this,” that. Mush sat beside me, staring down at the graves before he walked into the house. \n\nYou would think that was the last of it, right? \n\nI thought so. \n\nIt’s been two months since he had last given me that dead bird. But recently… I’ve been smelling decay in my house. Like… the smell of a dead mouse. I searched everywhere for that smell, from the basement to the upstairs bathroom. But the smell was strongest in my home office. It reeked of death, like nothing I could comprehend. Like, if Mush had dug up those dead animals and left them in my office. \n\n“Found the cause of it, Mr. Adam’s,” Jerry, my old neighbor had said as he picked up a dead raccoon. My eyebrows scrunched. What. The. Fuck. “Found it shoved between your bookshelves. You sure you don’t have a big hole somewhere in your house? That doggie door has a sensor, right?” Jerry grabbed a plastic bag and threw the decaying raccoon in there. The two of us almost gagged, Jerry’s eyes almost letting out a few tears. \n\nI looked away, my index finger and thumb pinching my nose. “I have a sensor doggie door. Mush’s collar is like the key for it,” I explained. Jerry nodded in understanding, not wanting to smell it any longer. His face was getting red from holding in his breath. I quickly took the bag away from him and held onto it. No way am I letting an old man die in my house because he was holding in his breath for too long. “Mush might’ve brought it in, he’s been bringing in dead animals… not recently, but he did,” I explained. \n\nJerry looked at me, a frown spreading across his face. “Did one of them happen to be a white cat?” he quietly asked. \n\nI immediately shook my head. “No, no. God no! Oh God, I wouldn’t know what I’d do if it was a cat or another dog…” I shivered at the thought. “Why?” I asked almost too quickly. Did Jerry happen to adopt a cat? \n\nWe headed towards the front door, Jerry stepping out first. It was so odd of him to be quiet. This was the man that greeted me when I first moved in and laughed about how much repairs I had to do to this house. Said he’d come help if I needed an extra hand. “Tulip’s been missing for three days now… My little Lily left the door open when she came to visit and Tulip’s been missing since.” Jerry let out a heavy sigh. \n\nLily was his granddaughter, about eight-nine years old. A little brunette with two missing front teeth. Whenever I saw her over and she saw me, she’d always yell about how her dad says that she lost her two front teeth last and that the tooth fairy still hasn’t given her money for it. Tulip though, I’ve never met. I assume it was his cat. “Ah, sorry to hear that,” I mumble and looked around. “If I see a cat, I’ll be sure to give you a call.” I smiled. Throwing away the bag in the trash can, I gave Jerry one last smile as he nodded and walked away. \n\nWalking back into the house, I let Mush out of his cage and almost walked away until I notice something in the corner of my eye. The corner of his lips were red. His two front paws were red. And when I took a closer look… there seemed to be white  and reddish fur and skin stuck in between his mouth. “Fucking God…” I whispered. Stumbling towards the kitchen and the back doors, I swung it open and looked around in my backyard. Nothing looked out of the blue until I realized that the corner of my fence had a hole in it. Running over there, I looked down at the ground to see that Mush had seem to dig through the dirt to give him an exit. No signs of a damn cat though. \n\nIt took two days to take Mush to the vet. And when they said that everything seemed to be okay with my dog, I insisted that something wasn’t right. I asked them if it was normal for dogs to bring in dead animals in the home and they claimed that it wasn’t common but nonetheless, they do give gifts. “Perhaps you haven’t been giving Mush enough attention? Does he have enough toys at home?” the vet asked me. A pretty woman, probably in her mid fourties’. Her brown hair was tied into a braid as she pet Mush whom seemed to be loving the attention. Odd. \n\n“Yeah… I mean, yeah, he’s got plenty of toys. My grandparents— I mean, I was basically the only person other than my grandparents that he tolorated so I had to take him in when they passed… I’ve never heard from them that he killed animals and brought it to them though,” I explained, my hand reaching towards my hair and began to scratch the back of my head. \n\nThe vet nodded in understanding. “I would say to just watch him when he’s outside. He probably just wants the attention and the only way he gets them is when he brings you…” she trailed off, “gifts.” \n\nAfter that, I tried everything. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Am I a bad dog parent? I’ve spoken to everyone about this. I’ve tried to enrich that little psycho with more treats and toys, encouraging good things with treats and when he continues to bring in dead animals, I would try to discourage it. I’ve tried to take him out on more walks and even put him in a doggy care when I know I’m going to be working long hours at my job. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve consider just putting him up for adoption. My parents though, didn’t want that. Saying that it’s what my grandparents wanted and I can’t just leave a dog like that. I can’t handle a dog that kills the wild and think it’s a gift. \n\nJanuary 1. \n\nHi everyone. I know I didn’t post this. But I’m thinking about keeping Mush inside. I didn’t want to post this, to be honest. I kept this in my drafts for the longest, hoping that his behavior would get better. I’ve hired a personal dog trainer but the trainer said that my dog was one of the most easygoing dogs there were. When we met up with the trainer, Mush listened to everything she was saying. It was as if he was trying to make me look like a weird person. How much I have to explain to people that he doesn’t like random people, to the weird gift giving. But when I say that, he’s as sweet as a chocolate cake. \n\nAnyways. I’m afraid to admit this, but Mush has been… to say the least, becoming more creative with his gifts. He stopped with the newly dead animals but you know what he brings out instead? bird eggs. Who the fuck knows where he finds that but he leaves them around the house and I’d have to find them before it starts rotting. First time it happened, the house started smelling again and I thought it was another dead animal. Turns out, it was an egg that he kept under his blanket in his cage. Second time it happened, I found one lodged in between the wall and fridge. \n\nIt was 4:45AM when I had woken up to the sound of clattering. Mush’s walking. I found it not so weird that he was walking around during unusual times but as I listened closely, his footsteps began to fade for three minutes before I heard running up the stairs. The door to my bedroom creaked open as I saw Mush’s figure walk inside. I didn’t bother to sit up or turn on the lamp. The bed felt heavier as I felt Mush lay beside me. Just as I was about to go back into my slumber, I heard chewing. The sound of bones crushing. The sound of squish. Not his usual hard treats. But soft, tender chewing. Immediately sitting up, I turned on the lamp besides me and looked over at the demon of a dog. The fucking dog was staring at me as he continued to chew. \n\nI called the police. They asked me series of questions, suspecting that I was the murderer. It wasn’t until one of the officers came over and informed the sheriff that they found who the arm belonged to. “Mr. Johnson’s heartbeat is still heard. They’re bringing him to the hospital now,” the officer said. \n\nMy eyes widen. “Jerry?” I asked. \n\n“You know him?” the sheriff inquired. “How did your dog get into his home?” he asked, narrowing his eyes. \n\nThe red and blue lights from the police vehicle was blurring my vision. “I— he was my neighbor. Of course I knew him. I—“ \n\n“Sheriff,” the other officer mumbles. “The others were looking at the scene and I don’t think his dog did it. No dog can smash a window like that…” he pointed at the front windows. “But there were bite marks that looked exactly like a dogs,” he explained ever so quietly. \n\nThe sheriff let out an exhausted or perhaps angry sigh. I wasn’t sure. They were planning to take me and Mush to the station for some questioning and I, as to their surprise, agreed too quick and almost laughed. I was going to get rid of his dog without the disapproval of my parents shaming me for putting him up for adoption or some bullshit. \n\nI walked into my house and towards the cage that I put Mush in. As I rounded the corner, my eyes landed on his cage to find it empty. \n\nIt was… opened. No signs of distress or broken lock, just… opened. \n\nThe police said they’d keep an eye out for Mush. But in the meantime, they’d need to further investigate the issue. It’s been three days since I last heard from them. Three days since I seen Mush. But recently, I’ve been smelling something strange in my house again. Except this time, it didn’t smell like a rotting animal or an expired egg. I’m thinking about moving soon. \n\nIt was a day ago that I was about to head to work and as soon as I opened my front doors, I found a finger. A single finger. Just laying on my porch. I didn’t dare touch it. Instead, I called the police and have them continue to investigate it. I wasn’t going to get my hands dirty for some fucking dog. \n\nScratch that, I don’t think Mush is a dog anymore.",

        "text": "Remy and I were walking through the food court at the mall. She kept squealing at the sight of every new selfie on Instagram of her and her friends that happened to get more than 100 likes every 5 minutes. Thankfully, busy as it was, I could tune her out. I'd have probably lost my damn mind otherwise.\n\nWhat I couldn't well ignore though was the fucker in a black hoodie over in the distance that I could tell was following me. At first, I thought, you know, maybe I'm overreacting because it's a big crowd, you know? Everyone's up and moving around, yakking each other's ears off, music's playing everywhere -- you know, \"alive\" -- and my anxiety was acting up. But then we get in line at the Chinese place and I look over to see the guy's *still* standing there, leaning up against the wall of the electronics store, *staring right at me!*\n\nIn most cases I'd have brushed this off, but like I said, anxiety was already through the damn roof at that point and on top of that, the guy's hood was pulled over his head to the point where I couldn't see anything of his face. Even still, yeah, I knew he was watching me. I don't know how, but I just *knew*.\n\nI turned and nudged Remy, asking, \"Hey, um... you see that guy over there, right?\" She turned to me and then to the guy.\n\n\"Um, yeah, why?\"\n\n\"I think he's been following us for the past thirty minutes.\" She raised her eyebrows, passing another back-and-forth glance between me and him. \"He's been behind us at least since we left the J.C. Penny.\" She kept passing glances for about another minute before noticing that we were next in line. She stepped up to the counter and started giving the guy her order while I kept my eye on the hoodie guy.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will point out that, yes, I am fully aware of how paranoid this all sounds. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that my little brother was still missing after having been abducted from the park at least two years ago, I probably wouldn't be as high strung about guys running around looking and acting the way he was. As it was, every second I continued looking at him, all I could think was that this guy either had a gun or a knife, hell, even a *bomb vest* or something under that hoodie. Something that he apparently intended to use on me for whatever reason.\n\nI didn't even realize I was actually staring at him until Remy punched me in the shoulder saying, \"Yo, Earth to Vince, what you want to eat?\" I broke and looked her.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"It's our turn, dork, you getting anything?\"\n\n\"Oh, uh... Y-Yeah, um...\" I rubbed my eyes and scanned their menu. \"Yeah, I'll have an order of the \"General Tso's Chicken\" with extra rice, four egg rolls, and a large...\" I trailed off again, glancing back to the electronics store. He wasn't there anymore.\n\n\"Sir?\" The cashier's voice broke me again.\n\n\"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, \"General Tso's Chicken\" -- Extra rice, four egg rolls, and a large Coke.\"\n\n\"Will that be all?\" he asked, writing the order on a slip.\n\n\"That'll get it.\" Remy replied. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Your total bottoms out to $21.75. Will that be cash or card.\" Remy started digging around in her backpack while I was frantically scanning the area for the guy. He was just there not two seconds ago, I thought, how in the hell is he gone? *Where* could he have gone? Oddly, this had my heart racing even faster than earlier when he was right there. At least *then* I actually *knew* where he was. Kind of like when you see a spider and go to grab something to smash it, but turn back around and *poof,* it's gone and now you're scrambling to figure out where the little fucker's gonna turn up next.\n\nThis didn't last long, though, because a quick glance over to the escalators was all it took. There he was, obviously still staring at me, coming up the escalator. He made it all the way to the top and stepped off, then just stood there. I felt Remy tug on my shoulder again. \"Yo, you got an extra dollar to spare?\"\n\n\"Um, yeah, hold on.\" I started digging around my back pocket for my wallet, not taking my eyes off the guy. I pulled out a dollar (possibly a five, wasn't paying attention), when a group of girls passed in front of the guy heading for the restrooms. When they were gone, so was he again. *Wait, what the fu--*\n\n\"Hey, Dork, the order's out, come on.\" I turned to see Remy holding the bags of our food, so I went over and took one of the bags, passing one last glance to the escalator to see if he was actually gone. He was.\n\nThe two of us sat down and got into the food. Another odd thing about me is that when I get nervous, my appetite actually increases. I started devouring my General Tso's like a fuckin' animal, darting my eyes all around the room, looking for him. Remy stared at me with her eyebrows raised while fiddling to open her chopsticks. I could also see weird stares from everyone around me, but hell if I cared. I'd burned through the chicken and almost half the rice when I spotted him across from the food court, standing in front of the Spencer's.\n\nI froze mid-chew, my cheeks still full of rice and my eyes doubled. *What in the hell is this? How is he all the way over there now?* I did a double take between the escalator and the Spencer's. I swallowed down what I had with a swig of Coke before getting up from the table. \"Where are you going?\" Remy asked.\n\n\"Um, just give me a sec, I'll be right back.\" I speed-walked over to the Spencer's, right up to the guy, and asked. \"Hey man, do I know you?\" He didn't say anything, just silently backed away from me into the store. \"Wait, hey, I'm talking to you, where're you going?\" He kept backing further and further away from me, still facing me as he went. He even bumped into a few people as he went along, which caused a few people to turn around and either say \"Oh excuse me\", or \"Hey, watch it, bro!\"\n\nIt made no difference to him though. He just kept backing further and further into the store until finally disappearing into a small group of punks gathered around at the back of the place, gawking at the rope bondages and ball gags, etc. I stood there for a good minute or so, throwing my head everywhere for about the millionth time trying to find this asshole. As the group started to migrate away from the cheap sex toys, I stopped a couple of them and asked them if any of them might've seen or noticed where the dude in the black hoodie went.\n\nNone of them replied outside of a few skeptical looks and bursts of chuckling. *figures...*\n\nOf course, this just confused me more because, again, he was right there. *RIGHT FUCKING THERE! How* could they not have seen or noticed *anything*? Not to mention the other recurring question of just how in God's name he could just up and vanish like that. There's no door at the back of Spencer's, not that anyone who doesn't work there would have access to anyways. Where hell was he now?\n\nI spent another minute and a half scouring the store like a lunatic before walking out and back to the food court. Remy was still at the table, eyeing me with a condescending smirk as she wiped her mouth. \"So uh, you find what you were looking for?\" she asked, snickering.\n\nI sighed and absently replied, \"No.\"\n\n\"Dude, what's going on? You're kind of starting to freak me out here.\" I looked around the area again before leaning in close to her.\n\n\"It's that guy in the hoodie.\" She frowned.\n\n\"What guy?\"\n\n\"The one I showed you when we were in line.\" She glanced up and around.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"I... I don't know, he's... He's gone again.\"\n\n\"Again?\"\n\n\"Yeah, first he was over by the electronics store, then the escalator, then I watched him walk into Spencer's. He just kept disappearing.\" For a moment, she just stared at me, utterly bewildered. \"I'm serious, this guy's watching me.\"\n\nShe pinched the bridge of her nose before getting up. \"Hey, where're you going?\"\n\n\"I need the bathroom.\"\n\nI stood up. \"Hey, wait, you can't go alone.\" She scoffed.\n\n\"What, are you gonna follow me into the \"Women's room\"? And here you are telling *me* about a stalker.\" She chuckled. I remained serious. \"Look, dude, I'll be fine, just wait for me here and, I don't know, we can hit up the arcade or something, I don't know.\"\n\nWith that, she walked off to the restrooms, leaving me standing alone in the food court. I stood, trembling violently. Everywhere around me, people were still up and mingling noisily. My eyes dared around the room hectically. *Where is he? Where did he go? How did  he disappear like that? Who even is he and why the hell is he stalking me? What am I--*\n\nMy thoughts abruptly died when I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"You okay, man?\" I turned to see this kid, about my height, probably just turned 21, staring worriedly at me. For a moment, the world seemed to both fly by me and slow down at the same time. I stood there, blinking rapidly at him for a solid minute and a half before shaking my head and replying, \"Uh... Y-Yeah... Yeah, I-I...\"\n\nHis eyebrow raised, eyes doubling in size. \"You lost?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"You looking for someone?\" I looked at him, and then back to the distance.\n\n\"S-Sorta.\"\n\n\"Need help? maybe you can have one of the security guards--\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" I blurted, not even realizing it until about a minute after. He sort of shrank back. \"Sorry, um... Yeah, you know, I might do that. You know where one would be nearby?\" He pointed over to the novelty hat shop just around the corner of the food court. \"Thanks.\"\n\nI speed-walked over to the hat shop and sure enough, there was one of the security guards, standing alert at the right of the door. I was in the middle of figuring out what I was going to say to him when, almost in a fucked up sense of irony, Hoodie guy was also there, standing perfectly still in the hat shop, obviously staring dead at me. This caused me to freeze up.\n\n*What the fuck, when did he get all the way here?!*\n\nI did a quick double-take between the hat shop and Spencer's. Even as long as it'd been since I'd last seen him, there was still no way he could've made it all the way from there to the hat shop without me seeing him at least once. Not with the way I was watching the place. The security guard looked at me. \"You okay, sir?\"\n\nI looked at him with one eye, keeping the other trained on the guy in the store. He seemed to pick up on this because he glanced inside at the guy and back to me. I nodded and he nodded before going into the store. I watched him walk up to the guy and ask him to remove the hood. He just stood there, unmoving, not taking his focus off of me.\n\n\"Hey, sir, you hear me, I'm gonna have to ask you to remove the hood.\" He still didn't move. The security guard radioed for backup before attempting to grab the guy's arm. This was when hoodie guy reacted by throwing the guards hand away and sprinting straight for me. My brain couldn't register the situation in time for me to do anything except throw my hands up in front of my face.\n\nI expected him to tackle me or something, but he didn't. Instead, I brought my arms down to find that he was gone again. The security guard came running out of the shop and looked at me. \"You see where he went?\" I shook my head frantically.\n\n\"Great.\" he said, mashing the button on his radio. \"Hey Ronson, Charles here, come in, over?\"\n\n**-- \"Ronson here, talk to me Charlie.\"**\n\n\"Keep an eye out, there's a punk in a black hoodie running around harassing people, possible shoplifter, just bowled me over in the hat shop before taking off.\" I heard a laugh sound over the radio.\n\n**-- \"Bowled YOU over? Christ, he'd have to be one big son of a bitch.\"**\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, look, just keep an eye out will ya, over and out.\"\n\n**-- \"Copy, over and out.\"**\n\nThe officer turned to me and said\\*\\*,\\*\\* \"Don't worry, we'll catch him. In the meantime, just watch yourself, 'kay?\" I just stared blankly at him and he went back to his post at the right of the shop entrance. I was frozen once again. Now I was even more terrified.\n\nHere's the thing, Ronson or whatever his name was, wasn't exactly kidding when he remarked about the guy having to be \"One big S.O.B.\" to knock the security guard down. The guard himself was built just like you'd imagine a bouncer in a shady looking bar to look like, and yet hoodie guy just shrugged him off like he was nothing. Here's the catch: hoodie guy *wasn't* big. At all.\n\nTo paint a clear picture, the guy was about my height, 5'9\" to about 6', and about as skinny as a rail. Without the hoodie, he'd probably look like the least threatening person there. Yet, *he tossed aside a fucking security guard that was THRICE his size!* If he could do *that*, then God only knew what he'd be able to do to me if he got his hands on me.\n\nI finally turned and headed back to the food court. It was right before I crossed the threshold, however, that I found him yet again, right there at the table Remy and I were sitting at. Immediately, instincts kicked into overdrive to rush back to the security guard and tell him, but before I could take even one step backwards, hoodie guy was sprinting right for me again. This time, he *actually* grabbed me, seizing me tightly by the shoulders.\n\nHis hands were shaking violently. My heart had stopped and so all I could do was stand there, a stuck fucking pig, and stare directly into his hidden face. The guy's whole body was shaking. I could hear his breathing -- that is, if you could really call it \"Breathing\". It sounded like an overweight chain smoker trying to breathe. My jaw fell open, flopping, trying to speak.\n\n\"V-V-Vih,\" I heard him wheeze out.\n\n\"Wh-What?\" I could feel myself starting to hyperventilate. I couldn't move, I couldn't fight, I couldn't think. I couldn't do *anything!*\n\n\"V-Vincent...\" he croaked. My eyes widened. How the hell did he know my name? All around me, the lights began flickering. I noticed, too, that *my* body was vibrating right alongside his. It felt like my body was becoming unthreaded like an old blanket.\n\n*What the hell's going o--*\n\n\"Vince!\"\n\nThe voice was clear now. Not only that, but it was somehow... *familiar...*\n\n\"Vincent!\" I swung my head around the room. The lights were flickering much more rapidly now. The people were all sort of shifting in this weird sort of way. You know how when you're trying to take someone's picture while they're moving and it comes out all blurry? Well, it was like that, but now imagine that they're all just moving in real time.\n\nNot only this, but the entire food court, the entire *mall* in fact, was vibrating in a similar way. Weirder still, though, was the fact that *this* didn't seem to affect the people all that much. The flickering lights, on the other hand, had them all up and rushing to the escalators. I, however, was fixed in hoodie guy's grasp.\n\n\"Vince, I need you to listen to me!\" he shouted. My eyes snapped back to him. I still couldn’t see his face. “We’re out of time! We have to go. I can’t sta—“ His voice cut out, fizzing into this static sort of fuzz while his neck jerked violently from side to side.\n\nThe lights flickering got more and more frantic. I should also mention that this entire time, my ears felt like they’d been stuffed with cotton and my breath felt heavy, making breathing more difficult than it should’ve been. His head straightened back up and he said, now in a voice that was noticeably smaller, younger perhaps, “I can’t stay much longer, Vince! The r-rif—“\n\nHe cut out again, his head seizing again, before snapping back up and saying, now in a voice I recognized all *too* well, “The rift is opening. Time will split apart and then—“ He cut off again. This time, his seizure was replaced with a loud, high pitched shriek, sounding like a little boy who’d stubbed his toe.\n\nThe way *HE* sounded.\n\n“E-Eddie?” Before he or I could do anything else, I watched his body vibrate until it basically phased out of existence right in front of me. The world looked normal again — well, sort of. Everything was still again in the sense that the world wasn’t vibrating anymore. The lights were still flickering though and everyone around was in a panicked uproar.\n\nEveryone was clustered at the escalators, shouting and screaming. I ran toward them to look for Remy. Trying to Wade through the crowd was damn near impossible to do, with everyone pushing and shoving around in every direction.\n\n“Remy!” I cried. “Remy!” I couldn’t see her. I couldn’t see *anything*, only millions of shifting bodies. Even this started to become more and more of a challenge when the lights started to go more and more.\n\nEventually, the lights finally vanished, blanketing the entire mall in darkness. In turn, all absolute hell broke loose, with people battering me from each direction all at once, all screaming. I lasted *maybe* two minutes before I was knocked to the ground. From there, I was essentially a human \"Welcome mat\" for everyone around to trample my entire body into a fuckin' mudhole. Just imagine this for a second, being stomped on from all sides in the dark; you can't see shit-all around you and can't hear yourself think from all the screaming that's surrounding you, suffocating you, essentially, and then all of a sudden, you see a large, mysterious glow bathing the room around you, What would you do?\n\nMy answer, not a goddamn thing except lay there. Stupid as I'm sure that sounds to you, I know, but aside from how bad my body was aching from being trampled for at least three minutes straight, the sight of the glow instilled a certifiable sense of dread in me. Somehow, I couldn't explain it -- and I *still* can't really -- but something in me was telling me that being in that light was a bad idea. Like somehow my life would be in danger from it or something *in it* if I stood up. \n\nThis instinct may well have saved my life, too, because the next thing I knew, People's shrieks of panic turned into bloodcurdling cries of terror. I heard the glass of the large windows next to the escalators shatter and people were all clamoring away frantically from the escalators. This, of course, meant I was stomped on again, but this time didn't last as long because most of those attempting to flee were almost instantly pulled back by something invisible. I craned my neck up ever so slightly to see what was happening and saw what looked like a giant, gaping purple maw right outside the windows, with people being whisked away into it, devoured by it, by fives or more. \n\nA few I saw were trying feebly to hold onto the rails of the escalators, but were soon taken like the rest. Before too much longer, I was being pulled in myself. I tried as hard as I possibly could to anchor my fingernails into the small crevices on the floor but that was quickly failing so I tried grabbing onto the rail of the escalator myself. I managed to lock both my arms and legs around it which managed, sure enough, to keep me stationary. Air came whipping across my face from the opposite direction of the windows, all of it, all at once, being ripped right into the swirling purple void along with everybody else. \n\nI held on for dear life, but soon, I realized this wasn't going to keep me safe for much longer because I could see the railing of the escalators starting to bend, pulling the post right out of the floor. I was out of options. Whether I let go now, or held on, I was gonna be pulled in. I closed my eyes and began to do something I hadn't done in at least three years; prayed.\n\n*God, please, I'm begging you, PLEASE, send an angel or something, just please don't let me get pulled into this thing!* \n\nCheesy as this is about to sound, this might've actually worked... In a way. I still don't really know. It gets extremely confusing here (as if it weren't enough already, right? Yeah, I get it, trust me). The post I was wrapped around was almost three quarters of the way off the ground by the time it happened, I heard a voice, somehow amplified through all the chaos. \"Vince!\" \n\nMy eyes opened and looked around. Reaching through the void was hoodie guy, Eddie. His voice echoed, cycling through all three of the voices he'd used before all of this, while his body twitched at supersonic speeds. \"Vince, you have to let go!\"\n\nMy eyes grew. *Let go?!* I screamed to myself in disbelief. He wants me to \"let go?\" Was my brother *trying* to get me killed too?\n\n\"Vincent, it's me,\" he cried in the child voice. Then in the teenager voice, he said, \"You have to let go of the railing! I'll catch you, but you have to let go!\" I looked down at the post of the escalator railing. Three of the nails had already been popped loose. This thing was *literally* one screw loose away from sending me into oblivion. I looked back to the void to see Eddie forcing himself forward out into the mall floor. \"Do it!\"\n\n\"I... I can't!\" I shouted. \n\n\"You can do it!\" he shouted back in the adult voice. \n\n\"I'm screwed if I let go!\" The sudden rush of air was now to a point where it was stinging my face. I looked at the post again. the last screw was already almost halfway out of its groove. The railing itself was starting to bend in the direction of the void. Eddie was all the way out now. \"Vincent,\" he called out in the child's voice again, \"You have to trust me, I'll catch you. Remember how you always promised to catch me on the monkey bars?\" \n\nI looked back at him, my heart pounding dangerously quick with my mind in over 10,000 places at the same time. He started toward me, but stopped, seemingly unable to walk any further. \"Vincent, you have to trust me, let go or you'll be taken with the rest!\" \n\nHe collapsed to his knees and began to seize violently. \"Hurry!\" I looked at him, then the void, then again to the railing. The screw was hardly hanging by a thread. The post was already leaning toward the window, further and further coming out of the floor. I began hyperventilating. \n\nI didn't know what to do. If I stayed, I was screwed, if I let go, I'd be screwed. I thought about how he said he'd catch me. How? He couldn't even stand up, how the hell was he going to catch me, and even if he actually could, what was going to keep the both of us from being pulled in?\n\nI closed my eyes again, taking a deep breath. *Calm down, Vince, just breathe.* Slowly, more unconsciously than anything else, my fingers slowly unraveled from the escalator railing. I was afraid, terrified actually, but I thought of the times Eddie and I would play \"Trust fall\" in my bedroom. A few times, sure, I'd be the douchebag big brother and let him bust his ass on the floor (though I'd always pick him right back up and let him get one good swing at my shoulder), but for the most part, I'd catch him, telling him I had him, that I'd always have him. \n\n*Even when he disappeared...*\n\nMy fingers unraveled the rest of the way and I felt myself being pulled like a feather in the rushing wind. As I was carried along, my eyes stayed shut, imagining the time he'd gotten stuck on the monkey bars at the playground, crying that he was too afraid to come down. \"Just jump, Ed, I promise, I've got you.\" He cried, claiming he couldn't do it, just like I did, and just like he did here with me, I promised him I'd always have him. He jumped and I caught him. The blow ended up taking us both to the ground and knocking the wind right out of me, but he was fine, perfectly safe. \n\nNow he'd have to do the same for me. He'd have to catch me, even if it might be at his own expense. I floated in a free-fall until I felt his arms grasp tight around me. His body was vibrating again, but somehow he was anchored to the floor. The air crashed against our two bodies with the force of at least 10 hurricanes rolled into one, yet he managed to stay put. \"I've got you Vince!\" I heard him shout in the teenager voice. In the adult voice, I heard him shout, \"Just hold onto me, it's almost over!\" With that, I wrapped my arms tight around him like I had the escalator railing. \n\nThe air crashed against us for another full minute, each second causing the vibrations of Eddie's body to pick up speed, before finally ceasing abruptly. Everything was quiet then. Everything was calm. My eyes opened and I was still there, in the mall. I was safe. I looked around, Eddie was nowhere in sight. I called out for him. Nothing. \n\nI jumped to my feet and started running through the food court, looking all around the mall. \"Eddie, Eddie, where are you? You there? Eddie?!\" My heart was pounding again. I had to find him. There were so many questions I had, believe it or not, the least of which being whatever the fuck all of *that* was from just two seconds ago. For a moment, I heard nothing but silence. The place was deserted. \n\nNone of the structural damage was visible, either. It looked like absolutely nothing had happened and just like it had before, save for the fact that there was only me now, nobody else. Nobody else, that is, except for Eddie. I heard his childlike voice call out to me from the electronics store, \"I'm over here.\" \n\n\"Eddie!\" I cried, both in relief and joy, running over to him. I was two steps from being in distance to snatch him up in the biggest bear hug of his life when I stopped. He shot out his arm and began convulsing again before crying out in the adult voice, \"Don't, just stay back.\"\n\n\"Eddie, you're alive! I.. I can't believe--\"\n\n\"No, bro, I'm...\" He cried out in pain before continuing in the teenager voice, \"I'm not, not really.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nIn the kid voice, he replied, \"I'm not really alive anymore, Vince. I'm not supposed to be here at all.\"\n\n\"I.. I don't... Eddie, talk to me, what's going on?\" His body twitched spasmodically, so violently in fact that I had to back away from him to avoid being hit by his arms. His body continued vibrating faster and faster, causing his voice to actually fade to a static buzz whenever he tried to speak. \n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here, in the real world. I don't have time to explain it, and I don't really think I could even if I *did.*\" His voice changed to the teenager's again. \"But what just happened has happened before. I don't know how many times exactly, but I was young when I first saw it...\" His voice shifted to the kid's and he said, \"8 years old.\"\n\nMy eyes widened. That was how old he was when he disappeared. He must've seen me connect the dots in my head because the next thing he said, in the adult voice, was, \"Yes, now you know what happened to me all that time ago.\" In the teenager voice, he added, \"It was so sudden. One second, I was looking at the toys, and the next, I'm being taken by the purple light, right along with at least two others.\"\n\nA cry of pain caused his body to jerk itself into a painful contortion before reshaping itself. In the adult voice, he said, \"God, it hurts so much now.\"\n\n\"What do we do? There's gotta be a way to help.\" He shook his head, and I could tell it wasn't just the spasms either, even if I was actually wanting them to be in this instance. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"There's no way to fix this, Vincent.\" he answered in the kid voice. \n\n\"There's gotta be a way!\" I ripped my phone from my pocket and was about to dial 911 when he told me to stop.\n\nIn the teenager voice, he said, \"I can't stay any longer, big bro. The longer I do, the more likely that is to happen again.\" He pointed over to the windows. His voice changed to the adult and said, \"I was lucky to escape, but I can't stay in one place for too long.\"\n\n\"But then, why were you here? If this thing follows you, why did you come?\"\n\nFor the first -- and last time -- he pulled off his hood, revealing the face of my long-lost kid brother, wearing a warm, if only bittersweet smile, and in the kid voice, he said, \"Because, Vince, I wanted you to know the truth and know that, just like you did with me, I've always got you.\" \n\nMy heart dropped into my stomach, shattering on impact. Tears started burning my eyes. Two seconds after those words left his mouth, the vibrations of his body began phasing him in and out of existence. I threw myself at him and wrapped my arms around him.\n\n\"No, no Eddie, you can't go!\" My arms tightened around him the more I felt him ebb away. \"Eddie! Eddie, no please don't.\" My breath was panicked. The lump in my throat finally took effect and the dam broke, flooding my face with tears. \"Eddie, no, don't go!\"\n\nAs I felt the last bit of my brother fade into nonexistence once again, I muttered, \"I've always got you, little bro.\" For a bit of time after that, I just sat there, on my knees, bawling my eyes out, repeating, \"I've always got you. I've always got you.\"\n\nI can't really say much about what happened afterwards. So much happened, and yet so little at the same time. The kicker with all of this, I'm slowly starting to forget what happened there that day, two days (3 maybe?) ago. I'm not sure, but I think that must be an effect of whatever the hell that thing was. That's why I'm recording this, to preserve the most detailed account of what happened. Oddly, I remember Remy because, through everything that happened, she survived. \n\nShe was the one that found me on the floor of the mall, in fact. When she asked what was going on, I couldn't tell her. Not only because of the emotional state I was in, but just the sheer fact that I didn't understand much, if anything, of what happened. And as I've said at least 100 times now, I STILL DON'T. \n\nI don't think I ever will. Maybe its best that way, though, who knows. What I do know, though, is that Eddie's still out there, somewhere, everywhere, nowhere, all at the same time. I know this because at least twice since this happened, I've seen him crop up in various places, always watching over me. Every time he does, a little message is left behind, **\"I Got U.\"** \n\nSometimes, these little notes are noticed by others and speculated about, calling them an \"Extraordinary phenomena.\" Only I know what it *really* is and what it *really* means. I've tried to make it a point to remember each and every time I'd be lucky enough to spot him. That's why I write this now, so I make sure I can keep my promise to him. I've got him, by making sure he'll never be forgotten.",

        "text": "When I was a kid, I used to have a stuffed toy named Laughing Larry. He was a stuffed toy in the shape of a small man, but there were other variations of it—depending on what features were customized, the people that bought it could make it look like themselves or a loved one, but my parents settled on him to look like my dad. My parents showed me that if I pressed his stomach, he’d start laughing and laughed for around two to three minutes. It sounded like my dad, who said he’d recorded himself laughing.\n\nThe thing is, it didn’t sound *entirely* like my dad.\n\nIt made me uneasy. The laughter felt fake, forced, as if he was forcing himself to laugh and be happy. But as long as I didn’t press his stomach, I was fine with him.\n\nHe stayed away tucked in a corner of my bookshelf.\n\nExcept for one day, I got home from school, and there he was, sitting on my bed.\n\nI didn’t panic. Not at first. No, I was a smart kid. I asked my parents if they moved him.\n\nBoth said no.\n\nI moved him back.\n\nAnd it went on like that for a few months, at least.\n\nSaw him on my bed, moved him back. He was there the next day. Moved him back again.\n\nUntil one day, I woke up and he was laughing as he sat right next to me. This laughter, though, sounded different. Deeper. More sinister, in a way.\n\nI screamed and flung it away. My parents had asked what was wrong, and I told them he was appearing at random and the laugh sounded weird.\n\nThey didn’t listen until he started showing up on their bed and laughing.\n\nThen came the… other things. Small things. A tiny, barely seen bruise here. A scratch there. Items going missing, particularly other stuffed toys.\n\nMy parents bought me a new stuffed toy. The next day it was gone, and in its place, there laid a note scrawled in sloppy, tiny handwriting.\n\n*There can only be one*, it had said.\n\nEventually, bigger things started to happen. Couch leather being torn. Plates smashed when we were all sleeping, only to find Laughing Larry sitting in the mess.\n\nWe decided enough was enough.\n\nWe threw him out.\n\nThe week after we did, all three of us had to go to the hospital because of unknown reasons—the doctors said something was in our food, based on the vomiting we had and the way our stomachs felt like they were twisting inside out.\n\nWe got better.\n\nWhen we arrived home, there he was, sitting on my bed and laughing like nothing bad had ever occurred.\n\nWe were too scared to throw him out again.\n\nSo we did the only thing we could think to do: burning him.\n\nBut even as we were doing that, he was still laughing.\n\nThat deep, dark, sinister laughter will always stay in the back of my mind.\n\nMy parents had another baby. He’s six now.\n\nFrom what I know, any traces of Laughing Larry has been wiped from existence. I tried looking online, and I even wrote to the old company, but they wrote back saying that all Laughing Larry’s have been discontinued.\n\nMy little brother came up to me yesterday to talk to me.\n\nThe first question he asked was, “Have you ever had a Laughing Larry?”\n\nI could’ve sworn I tasted bile.\n\nHe quickly ran to his room to show me my old Laughing Larry, the one that we burned and made sure was ash before dumping it out into the trash, who was sitting neatly on his bed.\n\nAs soon as I entered the room, without my brother or I even touching it, it started to laugh, that same, familiar laugh that had haunted me throughout childhood.\n\nI could’ve sworn that it was looking me in the eyes while laughing, almost as if it was saying, ‘Try to get rid of me. You can’t.’\n\nMy brother hasn’t started to get any injuries, nor have I or my parents, but I know it’s only for now.\n\nI’m going to find a way to get rid of this thing for good, whatever it is, and to make sure it doesn't come back this time, or ever.\n\nWish me luck.",

        "text": " This is the story of both the truth and a nightmare.\n\nYou see, I was in a grandmother’s kitchen - chewing on fry bread dipped in moose stew as one does - while listening to her stories. She would always tell me the most fantastical of stories, even now as an adult. Stories to learn from, stories to fear, stories of love and loss. Or stories just to tell stories.\n\nBut this story… this story was one of her own, from a time before her stories would become forbidden history. This story of difficult truths and hopeful fantasy that wrecks my guts that I’m sure was hard to share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I once was pretty as you, ya know.”\n\n“You’re still beautiful Grandma Anna.”\n\n“At least you recognize it. Eat’cher stew.”\n\nI stared at her a moment before dutifully following orders.\n\n“Once I was even younger and prettier than you.”\n\nI silently chewed away. I could feel a story was coming. A NEW story. And I listened raptly to her thick accent and slow cadence that comes with storytelling.\n\n“Once I was younger and could climb rocks and jump river. Once I could sing and dance to drums with my scarf. And once, I followed a butterfly. \n\nI ran after Butterfly with my brother. Through and between trees and along the river until we were far away from where we started. Far and fast from our pursuers. Faster than their voices could carry, faster than their heavy boots would take them.\n\nBut the chasers didn’ matter, Butterfly was taking us home\n\nThe sun was high and bright when we began following. This way. That way. Along cricks and past burrows. We ran after Butterfly as Chickadee sang, tellin’ us ‘no, no, don follow him that way. Turn left at the crossing.’\n\nAnd at the crossin’ we turned left.\n\nStill I could hear the monsters behind us. The brush underfoot could never be quiet enough, the animals avoidin’ us could never stay still. I never looked back to see if they tried to help us. Only Butterfly was who mattered.\n\nAnd still they followed us.\n\nWe ran and ran, as the sun began settin’ and the trail would lead us home. Chickadee said so. But we feared the dark. Because the monsters are out after dark. And not just our monsters - the Woodsmen and Bushmen - bu’ the chasers.\n\nWe could only hope and pray to Dena, and… pray to the God we only just learned of. \n\nI could hear the footsteps and shouts of the pursuers behind us. Getting closer. Strayin’ further. Back and forth.\n\nI felt my frustration build and build as your uncle Paul’s tiny legs hindered me. Hindered us. I couldn’ get him to be quieter. I was convinced he was why the monsters still followed us. \n\nPerhaps if I jus’ let ‘im go.\n\nNo. I couldn’ do that. I couldn’ leave him behind to the terror that lay with them.\n\nThe lick of razor straps. The darkness of locked rooms. The feelin’ of a switch on the palms and feet. I couldn’t leave him to the monsters. My heart jumped to my throat. How could I think that?\n\nWe were far along the trail and as the little darkness of summer settled behind the trees we came across a cabin. Chickadee had sent us to safety.\n\nWe pounded on the door, cryin’ for help when an old grandfather opened it. \n\n‘We need safety.’ I said. ‘Would you help us, grandfather?’\n\n‘Oh children? Of course. Wha’ could you be doin’ out in the dark middle of the woods, so far from home?’\n\nWe told him of Butterfly and Chickadee, of the pursuers still in the dark.\n\n‘Well, they’re not here. I hear no sound nor see the light of ‘em.’\n\nMy brother and I finally sighed in relief. We were safe for now. We were safe from monsters and the pursuers.\n\nWe sat in the middle of his small cabin. Shiverin’ and holdin’ each other as we waited to be warmed from the night breeze. We knew that we still weren’ safe. But we couldn’ continue on in the brief darkness of summer. There were only two hours we had to wait, but those two hours were enough we could be found.\n\n‘Here children.’ He handed us bowls we barely took the time to look into. ‘Have dinner.’\n\nWe easily complied. We were starvin’ from long before we even ran. We had been starvin’ for months… years… we could only guess at the time as even a day can be a lifetime to a child. We lived with monsters we had never heard of in tales. Neither Woodsmen or the others you know. What we did live with was the gnawing fear. The fear of not bein’ able to eat, and the fear of bein’ eaten all at once.\n\nAfter eatin’ we rested, savin’ our strength for the rest uh the day to come. That little time was enough for us. As soon as the sun began its ascent we left grandfather - smoked salmon and dried berries in a pack, and began our run again, leaving just in time to hear pursuers’ voices carrying. They must have rested as we had.\n\nThis time though, I had no direction ‘cept away from their voices. Through the trees and over rocks their voices carried.\n\nMy brother was too young to keep up. Today, I had to place him on my back to go faster. As quickly as I could I carried us along the river. Followin’ it home.\n\nBut I began to waver. How far were we to where we were from? Where was Nenana to Minto? On the map it had been so close, yet in the woods it was so far. Was our family still there? Were they taken by our chasers too? Was there anything waitin’ fer us?\n\nI remembered the day our pursuers took us. That day we saw all of the other children lined up. The day all of the children were taken from the village. The looks on the adults’ faces. The look upon mother’s. Some hopeful, some wary, and some against our absence.\n\nThe day all the children disappeared. We only saw a few of our friends from that day onward. We had been taken somewhere suppose ta be safe. Somewhere we were s’posed ta learn. Where we learned new things. And where we learned things we never needed. \n\nWhere we learned english. Where we learned maths…\n\nWhere we learned our families were wrong. How we were destined for what was called hell. Where we learned Dena was a lie. Where we learned all the spirits were dead and only God existed.\n\nThe only way to teach us - and teach us they did - was discipline. Because we could never be right enough. We could answer. But because we didn’t know all of the answers we were wrong.\n\nSo I ran with my brother. Even if the village weren’t still there, it was better than bein’ wrong.\n\nI ran so I would never have ta be wrong and be beaten.\n\nI ran so I would never have ta beat my brother. I’d never have to take the switch to him again. Never make his poor short legs bleed again.\n\nI was selfish. I left all the others behind. Your aunties and uncles you’ll never meet. Because we have no names and only learned their numbers. I never found them after.\n\nSo I ran. Away from the pursuers. Away from their voices. Along the river as far as I could, letting your Uncle Paul down only when I was too tired.\n\nUntil finally, I found Butterfly. I followed Butterfly, away from the river, through the trees, across the animal trails. We ran after Butterfly for a day before looking to the sky and seeing the sun slowly touch the horizon. At the same time I saw Butterfly took us to a den.\n\nSo we rested, hidden from Woodsmen who gave his awful cries and the dead dogs barking in the distance. Oh how we huddled in the den. How close the Woodsman came. Sniffing and growling. Looking for children like us to steal. \n\nHe came close. Closer. Closer. Sniffin’ this way and that, around the burrow, through the ground. We could hear every twig crack, every piece of dirt shift under foot as he searched.\n\nYer poor uncle whimperin’ as we huddled there. I was scared. I was too scared and held my hand over his mouth. His whimperin’ echoing in my head. How he laid there in my arms, as I held him tight to stop his strugglin’.\n\nI had to keep him quiet.\n\nThe Woodsman was so close to findin’ the entrance. His scent. The awful scent he carried in on the breeze. The smell of musk, overwhelming my entire being. \n\nI held your uncle tighter.\n\nI don’ know how long we laid there. How long it was until yer uncle stopped strugglin. Realizing I’d never let go. How my hand would never leave his mouth until the Woodsman left first. His breathin’ through his nose slowing. Calming.\n\nThe sun began rising. I could see light peeking between the treetops. \n\nThe Woodsman left to find his own home.\n\nYour uncle laid still as I let him go. I listened closely to his breathing. Slow and steady. At least one of us had been able to sleep that night.\n\nAfter eating some of the salmon we had been gifted we began to walk. We could no longer hear our pursuers. \n\nThe leisurely pace granted us time to heal. To find our bearings as we followed the moss north to where our home laid. Where we didn’t have to run no more. \n\nIt took us days of hiding in the dark and walking during the day. Of hunting for berries and catching the fish from the river. Taking the clothes off our back to make nets, tearing the hems to make ropes. \n\nStill, Butterfly would find us and Chickadee would guide us. Sometimes Raven would lead us. We would occasionally come across the Woodsman and a hungry lost Walker stalking at night, while during the day we avoided the crying Torega along the river branches.\n\nWe learned we could not avoid Torega. The Tanana had too many side channels and attached sloughs. That first time we met Torega… I didn’t know what to do. We had only ever been taught Shamen could get rid of them. Never how to escape them.\n\nThe heavy breathing of the creature as it prowled its domain. Right where we needed to cross. \n\nI held your uncle’s hand tightly. Could we run fast enough? No.\n\nThe speed of it. It darted left, right, jumping at birds too close. I could only watch in horror as it wouldn’t let anything living pass. Catching everything in reach. And worse… it was on both sides of the river and the nearby slough, darting over the water and through the trees. \n\nI swallowed. I had been going back and forth between walking alongside Paul or with him on my back. I was tired. Too tired. And the slough went for miles along the tributary. \n\nThen it screeched and screamed. It searched along the opposite side of the river, sniffing and crawling. Human and yet not. The fast long legs holding it up and long arms with reach to catch. Oh the sight. Its messy hair covered its eyes and its visible mouth held wicked teeth. There was no scent to it, as if it were part of the surroundings. I would never have warnin’ of its approach.\n\nI could only swallow back my disgust at the sight.\n\nWe had no choice but to go ‘round. Go ‘round as it stalked us from inside its domain. Durin’ the day we walked and walked over uneven ground, staying only close enough to the bog so we could see it. \n\nI had no sleep. The sound of warring cries throughout each night haunted me. The cries of Woodsmen overlapping with the cries of the Torega. One night I heard the battle. The scream of Woodsman and the ripping of flesh. It had gotten too close to the bog and into Torega’s domain. I held my hands over Paul’s ears, his terrorized crying drown out by the battle.\n\nSplashing, clawing, the smell of blood mixing with the musk of Woodsman. It surrounded me, putting my head into a fog. \n\nI don’t know how long it took before I heard the despairing cries of many Woodsmen throughout the forest followed by a scream of victory from the slough. The Woodsman had lost. \n\nI moved my hands from Paul’s ears, holding one hand against his mouth for what felt like the thousandth time and stroked his head, shushing into his ear. The battle was over and our sounds would carry in the now silent night. \n\nThe next day we walked further away from the slough than we needed before we came around and crossed the river the Torega had guarded.\n\nAnd this repeated. Every time we came across Torega we walked as far around the slough as our legs would carry us, no matter how much time it added to our travels. I didn’ want the last thing I saw ta be it’s hungry maw.\n\nWho knows how many days it took us along the Tanana and its children. But the day finally came. The day we stumbled out of the woods into Old Menhti. \n\nIt was a day that should have been joyous. The day two stolen children had returned. \n\nBut it was not meant to be. The happiness of seeing my parents. The bliss of a hug from my grandmother. \n\nAs I ran with the last bit of energy I had from a month in the woods and as my fingers brushed the hem of my father’s shirt I saw it. I didn’ remember their faces no more. How could I have forgotten their faces over these years? The last thing of safety I had ta reach for.\n\nAnd that’s when I heard them. The voices that belonged to faces I did remember. That I would know anywhere. The voice of a teacher. The voice of an enforcer. The voice of a clergy.\n\nHow long they had been there, how often they had visited and why of all children we were so important to find, I don’t know. They surely coudn’ know we would make it back. Perhaps it was the trick of the Man of Shadow - a brief taste of freedom to be torn from us.\n\nWe returned to the school and the days were the same. The bell. The bell that rang red in my head would sound. My eyes would open instinctively. I couldn’t be late. I didn’t want to have to have my hands smacked again. I would roll up and set my feet on the floor. \n\nWe were still locked in the halls of the boarding school. The boarding school hundreds of miles, and many waters and mountains from my home - impossible for my young legs to survive again. And even if they could, would I really want to see the Torega again?.\n\nIt was the same as always. Our punishments were doled out severely when we returned. Still it didn’t compare to the threats of the Torega. The sound of rending and gnashing of teeth meant for devouring would work its way into the back of my mind. ‘This place is safer if you survive it.’\n\nThe first week back I watched as a new student speaking his language caused the boys dorm to be whipped with the razor strap again. I watched my brother take the whipping as if it was a mosquito bite after our arduous journey. It was better than surviving the woods with the monsters again. We both knew a worse pain and fear.\n\nI found myself rougher. Angrier once we returned. Maybe it was because of our brief taste of freedom being ripped away. A girl who began absently humming near me. In my anger I turned to her and smacked her. I don’t know why I smacked her instead of speaking. \n\n‘You’ve been here long enough to have a name. You should know better,’ I hissed at her in frustrated anger. I couldn’t even tell her the story of our monsters I’d seen while she hummed the last of our songs happily.\n\nMy dreams were never the same again. I dreamt of Shadowmen and Shapeshifters, of Torega in the sloughs. Dreamt of the Shadowmen finding us and sucking marrow from our bones, of the Torega catching us and ripping us limb from limb for fun.\n\nAnd each morning I’d wake to a bell.\n\nToday I still wake to a bell in my head. And today I wake, scared to tell you stories, giving the names to these monsters. But these stories must be told. The stories of the Woodsmen, Torega, Bushman, and Man of Death. And equally so of Chickadee and Butterfly, Raven and Blue Jay. All the stories I’ve told you ever since you were a child.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat, soup cold and abandoned in my lap. Grandmother Anna looked so close yet so distant, half in the past, half in the present. “Grandma, you’re here.”\n\n“Yes child, I know.”\n\n“You’re here. You’re not there.”\n\n“I know. Let me get you some warm soup.”\n\n“...Yes Grandma.”\n\nI realize now it's not that she was distant, but that she was listening. She was listening because she is the only teacher who would use names. Names that have power. And… maybe that’s why tonight I hide in her home instead of leaving. Telling you her story as I listen to the infernal screams from outside.",

        "text": "As I tucked my sweet little Tommy into bed that fateful night, I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. I kissed him on the forehead and said goodnight, but as I turned to leave the room, I heard him whisper my name.\n\nI turned back to see him sitting up in bed, a look of fear on his face. \"Mommy, there's someone here,\" he said, his voice shaking.\n\nI looked around the room, but there was no one there. \"It's just your imagination, sweetie,\" I told him, trying to soothe his fears. \"Go back to sleep.\"\n\nBut as I walked down the hall, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was very wrong. I went into the living room and saw an old, dusty book sitting on the coffee table. And then I heard the voice.\n\nIt was a voice like I had never heard before, deep and guttural, filled with malevolence. It told me to open the book, and I couldn't resist its command. As I read the ancient words written on the pages, I felt a strange energy coursing through my body.\n\nSuddenly, Tommy let out a bloodcurdling scream and collapsed to the ground. I ran to him, but it was too late. The entity that had possessed him took control, using Tommy's body to carry out its evil deeds.\n\nFrom that day on, my sweet little boy was no longer himself. He became a vessel for the malevolent spirit, spreading fear and terror wherever he went. I took him to see doctors and specialists, but no one could explain what was happening to him.\n\nOne night, I heard strange noises coming from his room. I opened the door to find him standing in the corner, muttering in a language I had never heard before. I tried to approach him, but he let out another scream and lunged at me.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that my son was not himself. I called for help, and a group of priests arrived to perform an exorcism. As they recited the prayers and performed the ritual, Tommy writhed and thrashed, as if he was being tortured. But eventually, the malevolent spirit was forced to leave his body, and Tommy returned to normal.\n\nAlthough he had been saved, Tommy was never the same. The experience had left him traumatized and haunted by the memory of the entity that had possessed him. He often woke up in the middle of the night, screaming and covered in sweat, reliving the terror of that fateful night.\n\nI stayed by his side, holding his hand and whispering words of comfort, but I knew that I couldn't protect him from the horrors that he had experienced. The malevolent spirit had left its mark on him, and he would never be the same.\n\nAs the years passed, Tommy struggled to come to terms with what had happened to him. He sought help from therapists and support groups, but the memories of the possession remained with him always.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Tommy remained a kind and loving son. But his nightmares continued to haunt him, and he often woke up screaming and sobbing, reliving the horrors of that dark and stormy night.\n\nI did everything I could to help him, but the damage had been done. The malevolent spirit had left its mark on him, and he would never be the same. And as I held him in my arms, rocking him back and forth and trying to calm his fears, I couldn't help but wonder what other horrors the future might hold for my dear, sweet son.",

The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.\n\nAfter I moved to the monastery my life was truly different. I was trained as a warrior monk. I was 16. It was 1856.\n\nThere was lots of farm work to be done and I did it diligently. I went to church often and had my own bible where I started making revisions and edits.\n\nWe practiced krav maga for hand to hand fighting, and utilized bolt action rifles for ranged combat. When the chores were done the firing range was the first place i’d head. I was a crack shot.\n\nAfter I had arrived at the monastery Aliziza began to talk. He said all sorts of wise things. Yahweh said that I deserved one friend who wasn’t a traitor.\n\nThat morning I sat beside the water, praying with my compatriot Zackariah. We were both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.\n\nThat morning a pod of orcas came swimming up the river and started jumping in front of us. We sat and watched for a while before they came closer to shore offering their mouths to us.\n\nZackariah walked up and started rubbing the whale’s tongue.\n\n“They say the orcas haven’t killed a single person since Julius Caesar chased the land octopi from our dimension. They are so grateful to be the apex predator in the ocean now.It’s totally safe to play with these cuddly fucks.” he said rubbing the orca’s tongue.\n\nThe orca leaned back, and motioned with his flippers to join us in the water.\n\n“Join them” Alziza commanded.\n\nMe and Zackariah waded into the water and the orca’s came up under us and before I knew it we were surfing across the ocean side by side.\n\n“You know there is a spell to bring the land octopus back to our dimension so you can kill them” Zackariah said. “You know there are even people who still hunt them, a secret order started by Julius Caesar. Those guys are scary I tell you, you don’t want them to show up at your door. Anyone turns to stone and 1000 heads roll along with whatever land octopus they find. We’ve sent them a request to help us deal with the KKK but I doubt they will show.” Zackariah monologued.\n\nAs we surfed along I saw a number of simple octopus gathering and eyeing us suspiciously.\n\nAt the monastery we spent a great deal of time unlearning all the falsehoods that had been taught to us in school. We called them anti truths, things that meant the opposite of what they said. \n\n“What was the world like when Julius Caesar was around?” I asked Zackariah.\n\n“It was a time of monsters!” He responded. “They say that there was so much holy light during the reign of Julius Caesar that the men were 10 times as strong as they are today! They used to say a roman soldier was worth their weight in gold, as in all the gold in the world wasn’t worth the roman army. There used to be crocodiles so big they could swallow a buffalo whole. There were ground birds that terrorised the humans. There was a giant Beelzebub called the tarrasque that the roman army swarmed like ants. It’s said that Yahweh was so impressed with the roman army that he created siafu in their image” Zackariah monologued.\n\n“So Julius Caesar was the changeling?” I asked. “Why are the KKK gathering so many alleged changelings if they know who its going to be?”\n\n“That I do not know, we best head back. We don’t want to be late.” Zackariah responded.\n\nThe orca’s eventually brought us back to the monastery and we went inside. We were just in time for our meeting.\n\nThe KKK had been abducting alleged changelings from all across the Louisiana delta and doing who knows what with them. We were about to open the mail and see what other factions would join our cause, to liberate the abducted children.\n\nOur leader was very old, 136 to be exact. He said he was only the 7th person since Abraham to breach the 120 year hard limit imposed by Yahweh after the deluge.\n\nOur leader *Maximillion* stood in the chapel in front of all the monks of our monastery. There were other monasteries under our leader’s control as well, but this was our head base.\n\n*Maximillion* held the letters of all those factions we had messaged for support and was ready to read them.\n\n“We will start with this new church, these Mormons,” Max said.\n\nHe took the first sealed letter off of the table and opened it. His eyes bulged with anger as he read it.\n\n“Remember the Alamo is all it says.” Max spat on the ground. “Godless heathens”\n\nHe took the next sealed letter from the table. \n\n“Next the Cesarians.” He opened it and read it. “They won’t arrive until they see someone turned to stone, as always.” Max said with a smirk.\n\nMax had two enchanted bibles that followed him around, Grimoire Noir and Grimoire Blanc. They hovered at his side while he read the letters.\n\nMax grabbed the third letter “Next from the northerners, this Abraham Lincoln fellow.” He opened the letter and read it. “He has pledged 200 cavalry and 1000 troops. They will arrive the following day to us.” Max said, putting the letter back on the table.\n\nMax grabbed the fourth and final letter off of the table. “Next we hear from our native american friends” he said, opening the letter and reading it. “They have pledged 200 braves. They have weapons, but could use any rifles we have to spare.” Max said.\n\nHe gathered the letters and started speaking with more authority. “We will rendezvous with the monks from the other monasteries and the braves before reaching Dixie. We will camp on the outskirts and await support from the northers. We leave immediately.”\n\nAnd with that we were off. From our one monastery we had a force of 75 monks, some with horses. I rode upon mighty Alziza as we made the journey towards Dixie.\n\nWe knew we were getting close when we started seeing strange things. Deer with alligator jaw sewn on, cows with alligator jaws sewn on, and even buffalo with alligator jaws sewn on.\n\nWhen we reached the rendezvous point we set up camp and waited. \n\nBefore long we were spotted by some klansmen. We would have fired upon them but they came waving a white flag. Their alligator jawed dogs had their tails between their legs.\n\n“Hey ya’ll. We can see that you appear to be here for a siege of some sort, but we arn’t so bad! We are having a party, why not come and judge some southern hospitality for yourself” The klansman said waving his white flag.\n\nWe gathered our rifles and went to investigate. What we saw made me want to vomit. They had not only roasted up the whole farm, along with buffalo, iguana and fish. But they had a giant vat of soup cooking.\n\nJeff sat there tasting and salting the soup. \n\nThen I saw Dale come out of the shadows holding a black child. He threw him in the soup. \n\n“Changeling soup is my favourite” Dale belched.\n\n“The black ones are the tastiest,” Jeff laughed.\n\nI had seen enough, and loaded my rifle. I shot Jeff through the ear as he sipped at the ladle. Upon realising what had happened to all the alleged changelings the other monks began firing as well. 7 bullets hit Dale in various places.\n\nThe klan was ready and rifle and musket fire came at us from multiple directions.\n\nWe all had good bolt action rifles while most of the klan only had one rifle shot, then one pistol shot, then charged us with swords.\n\nWe got in a circle and were firing wildly in all directions, shooting down klansmen by the dozens.\n\nI fired, loaded, fired over and over as hooded klansmen dropped like dead flies.\n\nThey reminded me of ghosts coming with their swords. \n\nEventually the klansmen fled to regroup and we did a head count. We were down to 52 monks.\n\nWe scouted the area and found the braves and other monks looking for us. We were now up to 175 monks and 200 braves.\n\nWe walked until we were in sight of old Dixie and set up camp.\n\nAfter a while a large force conveigned outside Dixie. I was alarmed to see 3 Dora’s leading the leading the troops. The one I had seen created along with two others who were made from the other body parts of Deb’s children. One of the Dora’s commanded the force that headed towards us.\n\nThere was a large number of klansmen as well as gator dogs, gator bears and some heinous monstrosities.\n\nWhen they got closer, Dora took out a megaphone and screamed into it.\n\n“Allow me to introduce you to my latest creations! MAn bear pig, Pigman bear and man bear pig!” Dora screamed.\n\nI noted the pig man bear hybrids that lined their ranks as they charged into firing range.\n\nWe fired all together at first then started firing at will. \n\nThe monstrosities charged at us in waves and many were killed before they came close.\n\nBut once they did they decimated our ranks. Gator bears tore through us like butter, ripping people apart. IT was every man for himself as monks and braves fought back with sword, bow and arrows, rifles and clubs.\n\nI fired a shot through the man bear pigs eye and loaded my rifle, then fired through the eye of a gator bear. It was utter chaos, but Yahweh favoured me that day and nothing came right at me.\n\nI surveyed the battlefield and saw grimoire Blanc petrify a gator bear.\n\nGrimoire noir pelted a pig man bear with napalm and it shrieked as loud as any pig.\n\nThe monstrosities and klansmen started to flee and we shot them as they ran.\n\nDora stood looking at her dead creations. I loaded my rifle to fire when I heard a loud buzzing. And then bird sized wasps came flying out of dixie and landed near us.\n\nThey then turned into beautiful women and started moving across the ground on their backs.\n\n“Shoot em through the pussy!” Max screamed.\n\nI fired right through where he said and the woman turned into a wasp I had shot it in the head.\n\nBefore long we had dealt with the wasps.\n\nWe started doing a headcount, seemingly losing at least half of our troops in all the chaos.\n\nThen the monstrosities and klansmen came back for round two.\n\nWe unloaded into them as they charged towards us but they hit our reduced ranks hard.\n\nChaos ensued again as monks and braves were eaten.\n\nWe fought valiantly but it seemed all hope was lost, but then there was a lull in the fighting and I turned towards the sunset.\n\nOver the hill I saw Abe and his cavalry. They charged into our midst and I saw Abe behead Dora.\n\nBefore long what was left of the klan was fleeing. There was not a single monstrosity left from the force we had battled.\n\nThe next day we parlayed with the KKK and they agreed to stop abducting changelings. AT least for the time being. We headed back to the monastery with our heads held high.\n\nI record this here so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of what happened during the first changeling crisis.",

        "text": "\nBefore I share the details of what happened that day, I want my purpose to be clear. I am sick of the questions that I have been getting on a constant basis. Believe me or don’t, I no longer care. I know I’m not crazy and I know I’m not lying.\n\nMy name is Shelby Hayes and I am a substitute teacher for one of the school districts in Ohio. I’m fairly new, only getting credentialed a couple months ago, but I love my job and love the kids. Now I can’t help but be shaken in my certainty that this is the job for me and it’s all because of last Friday.\n\nLast Friday even started out differently than most days. Instead of calling out like they usually did, the teacher I was subbing for just hadn’t showed up for class that day. The school had tried to reach her but hadn’t had any luck. A welfare check was conducted but I didn’t hear the result of it till that afternoon. That was the last I really heard of it at that point. Anyways, it wasn’t my business. They needed a teacher and I was available.\n\nI walked into the class room. Pictures of a brown haired woman standing next to different students adorned the walls along with art project that all looked like rainbow colored blobs. I smiled as I passed one of the little blobs labeled “dog.” The atmosphere was that of a normal, happy kindergarten class. Ms. Shaul, the teacher, obviously had put in a lot of time and energy for making the room the perfect place for children to learn and play.\n\nThere looked to be about twenty little ones sitting on a rainbow carpet. The principal smiled at me and with an “All right kids, you can have free play till I’m done talking with Ms. Hayes!” they were off laughing and running around in all different directions.\n\nMr. Perry, the principal, welcomed me to the class. He informed me that today he didn’t expect too much from me. The teacher’s assistant was out sick, so structure was going to be extra difficult.\n\n“Just make sure Brandon doesn’t eat any paint… it’s happened a couple times now. Oh! And if you could encourage Jenny to play with the other kids, that would be great.” He pointed to a little girl playing with a doll in the corner. She likes to play in her own little world. Other than that, they’re pretty easy kids.”\n\nI thanked him and then he left. I immediately made sure the paints were out of reach and then turned my attention to Jenny. She was a cute little blonde girl in pigtails. I expected her to still be alone but to my surprise she was merrily playing with a little brown haired boy.\n\nI walked up to them and kneeled. They both smiled up at me. The little boy introduced himself as Adam and proudly stuck up five fingers when I asked how old he was.\nI was attached by an onslaught of questions including if I had children and if I had a favorite color. These were pretty standard questions for this age but the next one out of Adam’s mouth was a bit odd.\n\n“Miss Hayes?” He asked me. “Is it okay to be happy and sad at the same time?”\n\nThat was quite the deep question for a child so young. Still, kids asked weird questions all the time in this profession.\n\n“It’s okay to feel however you feel. Why do you feel happy and sad?” I asked gently.\n\nHe seemed to hesitate in answering, looking down and shrugging his shoulders, so I tried a different tactic.\n\n“Okay, what’s making you happy?”\n\nHe smiled and excitedly told me “I get to hug my Mommy today. I haven’t seen her in so long!”\n\n“Did she go on a trip?”\n\nHis smile dropped and he looked down again, brown hair covering his face. Obviously this was a sore subject.\n\n“Okay, will you tell me what’s making you sad?”\n\nHe looked up and motioned for me to come closer with his little hand. I did and he whispered in my ear.\n\n“Malcom is coming.”\n\nSomething about the way he said this sounded so insidious, like he was announcing true doom just by saying the words; perhaps in his mind Malcom did bring doom.\n\nI questioned who Malcom was but he shut down again. This worried me but I decided not to push him. My first thought was that this Malcom guy was somehow abusive. As a mandated reporter, you are always on the lookout for those situations. Still, I was jumping to conclusions much to fast so I slowed myself down.\n\n“When you’re ready to tell me about Malcom, I’ll be here.” I said with a smile, before getting up and moving to the front of the class. Jenny and Adam went back to playing, having some type of conversation.\n\nThe day was passing very quickly. Brandon wanted to know if we could paint today, making me thankful for Mr. Perry’s warning. I was just about to tell the children that it was clean up time so they could have snack when I felt a little hand pulling at the sleeve of my sweater. I looked down to see Adam.\n\n“Malcom’s very angry.” He said sadly. His eyes were from filled with sorrow and his voice was no more than a hushed whisper.\n\nI knelt down beside him.\n\n“He didn’t used to be.” He continued, “But he changed.”\n\nHe looked so sad. I gave him a comforting hug.\n\n“When did he change?” I asked softly, but he ducked his head down before walking away. I feared abuse, and planned on talking to the principal after class.\n\nSnack time came and left and the students continued to play. The panting sound of breath and little foot steps rushing towards me caused me to turn around.\n\nIn a panic, Adam ran up to me.\n\n“Malcom’s coming here.”\n\nI was confused and he must have realized it. He took a deep breath before continuing.\n\n“Malcom is coming here with a GUN! He’s going to make everyone go to sleep!” His eyes were wild and it seemed as if he believed everything he was saying.\n\nI felt a shiver go up my spine. This didn’t feel like a child making things up. Adam looked genuinely terrified. I was frozen for a moment when his high pitched voice broke me out of my stupor.\n\n“Do something! He’s almost here!” He said, waving his little arms.\n\nAdam was nearly hyperventilating, so I rubbed his back before I got up.\n\nTo keep him calm, I grabbed my chair and quickly jammed it under the door handle making a blockade. I went to call the principal to tell him of this threat the little boy was claiming as it was policy. I could only hope that as soon as I called Mr. Perry, he would tell me that Adam had a very big imagination. Before I even reached the telephone, I heard the sound of a doorknob jiggling.\n\nI turned around as the classroom door was attempted to be forced open. My nerves were glittery as the timing was just too weird. I scolded myself, reminding myself to think rationally. Maybe it was the principal? But then why didn’t he knock?\n\nThen the door was left alone. I let out a sigh, feeling relief even though I knew it was silly. I turned back about to call the principal’s office.\n\nThen I heard the screams.\n\nChildren, adults. Loud, deafening gun shots. I screamed at the students to get under their desks while getting my cell phone and dialing 911. I turned the classroom light off and went under the teachers desk. Crying could be heard from all over the classroom. I whispered calming words to the children, while simultaneously trying to calm myself down. We were in a school shooting and had I not just barricaded the door, we would all be dead.\n\nWhat felt like hours later, the police had rushed the school. My class had no injuries. We were the only class down that hall who could say that.\n\nI shuffled the children out in a line to their parents who were already waiting for them.Everyone was accounted for, everyone except for Adam.\n\n“Adam!” I screamed in a panic. “Where’s Adam?!”\n\nThe parents and students all looked confused. I repeated my question, fearing the worst. A plump red haired woman walked up to me. She introduced herself as Mary, a member of the PTA. She stated “There isn’t a kid named Adam in this class.”\n\nI was so confused and even angry . “Yes there is!” I argued. “He was playing with Jenny this morning!”\n\nAll eyes turned to Jenny as she nodded.\n\n“Yep!” She said with a smile. “Adam is my invisible friend!”\n\n…\n\nBy that next day, the news reports filled in the holes that my own recollection had concerning what had happened. Twenty three people had died, with 15 of them being under the age of seven. Ten had suffered serious injuries but were expected to make a full recovery. The shooter was a young man named Malcom Shaul. He had brown, greasy hair and a permanent sneer painted on his face in every photo the media got a hold of. He was a sixteen year old with anger issues towards about anyone he’d ever met.\n\nHe had killed his mother Alex Shaul, the regular teacher of the class, that morning. He knew how much she loved her students and felt he wouldn’t get his perceived revenge on his loving, but still imperfect mother, unless her students were taken out as well. At least, that is what he had written in his manifesto. He pulled the gun on himself before the cops could take him in.\n\nHis remaining family claimed that he had once been a happy young boy. That had all changed when his twin brother had been diagnosed with leukemia. Malcolm had never been the same since the unexpected death of his twin brother over a decade ago. He hated his mom for still finding joy in life after his brother’s tragic passing. He also blamed her for his father leaving shortly after the funeral.\n\nAn old picture of the Shaul family of was spread all over the television. In the picture, Alex held one of her twin boys in her arms while the other was riding piggyback of their father’s shoulders. A picture perfect family destroyed so long ago.\n\nHe had never been the same since the death of his brother Adam… I guess now I knew why Adam hadn’t hugged his mom in so long.\n\n….\n\nSo there you have it. Adam Shaul warned me of what his brother was going to do that day. No one believes me and I understand why. Still police have wanted answers to why the chair was jammed in the door when there was no warning from anyone that the Monroe shooting was going to take place. The media has hounded me, so I finally decided to share my side of the story. Perhaps death isn’t always the final chapter. Perhaps we stay when our loved ones are hurting. I don’t know, but I do believe that Adam is finally at peace. It must have been torture watching his brother mentally break for all those years.\n\nI’ll be moving as soon as the police clear me in any involvement with the shooting. I’ll start a new life with a new name in a new place. The name Shelby Hayes will always be tainted now.\n\nAnd don’t worry, I plan on finding a new career too. I will never work with children again. I don’t know what I’ll do for work, but I’ll figure that out when the time comes. Forever I am haunted by the children I could not save, and the memory of sweet little Adam Shaul.",

        "text": "From the little I've read, a lot of stuff in this sub seems pretty intense and I'm not sure how much I believe most of it, but I can't think of somewhere else to post stoy. I hope you don't find it too underwhelming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I don't want to discourage anyone reading from becoming a scarer; its probably the most fun I've ever had at a job, and with most of us actors being queer and/or disabled, it was an extremely accepting and accommodating environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let's get into the story:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last year I auditioned as a scare actor at a local attraction; it's no Halloween Horror nights, but it had rides, nine haunts, roaming actors, and seems to be pretty big in my city and the surrounding area (I had only just moved here, but everyone I know had been at least once).   \nI made it through the group interview, and was told to come to the training day. There were a lot of people there-- front of house, managers, swings, makeup people, and (of course) actors. Many of the actors were returning from previous seasons, some older ones even wearing ten-year ennamel pins, but even then, I was one of fifty-or-so new hires.\n\nThe first training day included an introduction from my new bosses, a massive powerpoint of trivia, basic information, and blown-up versions of the wavers and contracts we were signing for those hard-of-sight. Luckily, all the presentations we were given were put on the work facebook, so I'll be citing that since my memory's a bit spotty lately.   \nFirst, they welcomed us new recruits, saying that this was their biggest intake in recent history (Pause for cheers). They seperated us and paired up houses by location, gaving us rundowns of what we would be doing during training (break for water and inter-catagory icebreakers). \n\nFinally, they brought us together again to discuss storytelling and lore stuff. I'm not sure how much I can say, we had NDAs to avoid spoiling the opening ceremonies, but basically, the fan-favorite mascot was being replaced with a new one portrayed by a veteran scarer. Apparently the previous actor's performance had been so unique and transformational, that no one else could fill his shoes, meaning that the character (Who we'll call 'old splicer') was being retired.   \nThe lore was that he was mutated while toying with the canister's in one of the famous Haunts (We'll call it Metrica Medicum) and was mutated into the new mascot. It was all pretty cheesy, but very fun all the same.\n\nNext they showed us some of the masks-- hideous, beautifully crafted silicone faces worth thousands each. I worked as a masked character for the latter half of the season so I can confirm those things are valuable: hair pins and eating in it are banned, and you can't even put it on or remove it without supervision. They're also heavy and wet and make you break out like crazy, but that's just a personal gripe; objectively, they're incredibly life like and creepy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first actual training day we had was called 'scare school', a new protocol they were beta testing this year. My group started with the 90 minute seminar on healthy screaming, lead by a heavy metal vocalist. Next, we had an improv workshop and a set/prop safety overview, but I don't remember much of those. However, our personal-health-and-safety workshop had a documented presentation I could find: we started with social safety and communication, then mental and emotional health, which included a \"Me Vs. My Character\" worksheet, and another about grounding ourselves so we won't dissociate in costume. Finally, we went over physical health stuff (Eg: calling in sick, sleeping 8 hours, wearing shoes with arch support, and not ODing on energy drinks which is very prevalent issue in the profession). \n\nThere's also powerpoint slide here about 'religion and identity health', but as cool as that sounds, it's just about brushing it off when scared guests call you abomination or hurl slurs at you while in costume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first night of work was insane, hoards of actors getting masked and made up, chugging pre-workout and doing emergency costume repairs. The whole thing was a blur, the fog machines that filled the park flooded into the hairspray-stinking dressing room, the other newbies and I were super nervous, and supervisors yelled over the chatter and music for their groups to circle up. I was tying my boots, sat next to Jacob-- the veteran scarer from earlier, who was promoted to the new mascot actor-- he was in the older demographic of actors. \n\nI don't remember clearly, but this is my approximation of our conversation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey kid, you excited?\"\n\nI confirmed. \"Is it always this crazy?\"\n\n\"First night's always crazy.\" He said, a few costumers bustling around us-- I remember they kept tripping on me. \n\n\"Are you excited to be playing the CRYSPER?\" I asked while he was forcing his head through the tight neck canal of the mask.\n\n\"Well, yeah.\" He said, voice probably muffled by the mask-- they do that quite a lot, even on the off change they actually fit you. \"I miss Gerry, we worked together on a lot of projects, I don't think I could ever live up to his Splicer.\"\n\n\"Gerry was the old actor?\"\n\n\"Yeah, He was a great man. Great actor too, but he seriously disappeared when he played Splicer. He was like a whole other person under the mask.\" Someone called five minutes to Opening Scarimonies, Jacob smacked the side of my head and said, with his in-character vocal-fry.  \"Break everyone's legs, kid. seeya after.\" (I remember that bit with clarity.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the last time we talked in costume. I saw him before work every night and we would chat a lot before we masked up, mostly about about panic buttons and rowdy guests we'd heard about from the clowns.\n\nI only just put together that I don't remember talking to Jacob with his mask on, and since I last saw him in costume during group photos (he didn't come for end-of-season drinks with the rest of us) I wonder how he's been doing. He's still on the FB but hasn't answered any of my PMs. I asked some of his long-time acting buddies and they haven't seen him cast in anything lately. \n\nI made it through group interviews again this year. My carpool from last season's been promoted to a Supervisor, She's going to check the cast list when it goes up to let me know if he's returning this season.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this isn't as scary as some of the other stuff here, I just thought it was weird and wanted to share",

        "text": "He always leaves his apartment at 5am, black hoodie, black shoes, black jeans and black gloves. I always make sure im on time to see him. I usually have to take care of my kids at this time and wake them up for them to go to the kindergarden, but this addiction made me think about him more than my own birthed kids. Its fine if they skip a week, they usually always come home and never learned anything from that day for a daycare that i pay 40 dollars each month. \n\nBut look at him, so  beautiful, so charming the way he moves, oh god i think im going to faint over how much a god created a such beautiful man on this earth, even more beautiful than my own kids. As i walk way behind him so he wouldnt notice me, im ready this time to actully do it, ive practiced it with my kids and searched the internet to do it the best way possible.   \n \n\nI speed up my tempo to get closer to him and as i clenched the bat in my hands and was ready to swing at him, i trip and fall face first.   «FUCK» i screamed loudly in pain .He stopped walking and turned around  «shit shit shit shit» i thought to myself and hid the bat in the bag.   A calming voice spoke to me «Hey miss are you okay? Your nose is bleeding»     «Yeah im fine. I just need to get home» fuck i had to think of something quickly «i had a few too much drinks last night because i got rejected from my dream job and my husband left me for a 20 year old college whore»   «oh im sorry, im kinda in the same situation you know? I just had kids taken from me and i needed a walk to sort all of this out»   «yeah i know, you always leave your house for the last 5 days at 5am and cry out loud so you think no one hears»   \n\nHe paused for a moment and tok a step forward towards my face «maam i think youve had too much to drink and maybe you need a hospital for that nose»  «Do you have a car?» i said «yes ill come and pick you up, just stay here» he said   As i waited for his car, he helped me up and started driving.     \n  «You know i always loved having a stalker these five days, it made me feel less alone» He stated   «Oh so you already know? Thats great i was about to swing a bat at you neck so i could kidnap you and have you for myself» i stated back «My cries really have a thing for women your age, its like a damn magnet, also i really appreciate your honesty about throwing a swing at me, the others really come up with some bullshit to appear dumb and stupid, i really like you» \n\nWhile he spoke and spoke, sweat started to run down my forehead and im pretty sure were not driving to the hospital.   \n\n  \n «Well were here! Say goodbye!» he exclaimed   \n «what the fu-»   \n «Thank you for your offering Dexander. This will sure satisfy the gods of eve for getting rid of women who sin. Your cries are really doing good in sales these past few days, maybe youll get a promotion some day!» \n\n «Anything to make the world a better place!»",

        "title": "Consider a chihuahua as your next guard dog",
        "author": "lowtierWAH",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1056i5c/consider_a_chihuahua_as_your_next_guard_dog/",
        "text": "When a string of robberies started happening around the suburbs where we lived, Amber had suggested we adopt a guard dog. I knew this wasn’t the real reason she wanted a dog, however. It was only six months ago that her childhood dog, Bubba, had died of old age. From what I was told, he lived for almost twenty years. He was an old, ragged chihuahua when I had met him, with wet, bulging eyes rimmed with gunk, and his tongue constantly slithered out between his gnarled teeth like an earthworm emerging from the mud. I was never fond of Bubba, or any chihuahua for that matter. While I knew instinctively that they could be just as loving and loyal as any other breed of dog, I’ve never met one that was well behaved. I put up with him for Amber’s sake, though, and I mourned with her as he took his last breath in her lap. I knew there was a hole in her heart after Bubba’s passing, so the day after she had suggested adoption, I surprised her with a trip to our local animal shelter. \n\nThat’s when we met Bambi.\n\nYep, Bambi, as in the cute deer from the Disney movie of the same name. And of course he was a chihuahua. A slightly larger than average specimen with a deer shaped head and a white coat with fawn splotches on his back. In terms of appearance, the name was perfect. But when it came to temperament he was nothing like the innocent animated deer.\n\nI watched as Amber cooed at him from the other side of his cage, and I could already tell, much to my misery, she was head over heels for him. The shelter worker next to me appeared surprised that Amber was fawning over him. She said to us that Bambi had been with the shelter for a long time, and that although many families had viewed him, they all turned him away for one reason or another. She said she once saw a small child burst into little tears of fright when Bambi looked at her. \n\n“We have no idea where he’s originally from,” the worker told us. “He was just dumped on our doorstep one day. Nobody claimed ownership of him, and he’s been here ever since.”\n\nWith no one wanting to adopt him, she told us Bambi was scheduled to be euthanized. I knew immediately what Amber’s reaction would be, and I withheld any objections as she sprung to her feet and told the employee that we’d love to adopt Bambi as soon as possible. As she and the employee talked away, I spared a glance at what would soon be our new dog. Bambi stood perfectly still, and he was as silent as the grave. This was unusual to me, and a small part of me perked up, thinking that maybe if he was this well behaved, I wouldn’t mind having him around after all. That was until I noticed his eyes. As Bambi’s head swiveled from Amber to me, I felt a small shiver roll up my spine. His eyes were so…black. No, black wasn’t the right description here. It was more like staring into a complete void of nothingness. Like there wasn’t any life behind those dark pits. It…it felt wrong, and I knew then why that little girl had burst into tears when Bambi looked at her. There was a part of me that wanted to grab Amber’s arm and drag her far away from here, and let that dog be put down. I stopped that thought dead in its tracks as I forced myself to look away from Bambi. No, what was I thinking? It was just a dog. And no dog should just be put down like that. I still couldn’t get his eyes out of my head, though, and I tapped Amber’s shoulder to get her attention.\n\n“Don’t his eyes look…kinda weird to you?” I asked, hoping for some validation. Amber turned back to Bambi, and knelt down to meet his eyes. She stuck a finger through the cage, using it to scratch his chin.\n\n“Awwww,” she squealed, “you’re just the cutest, aren’t you? Who is a good boy? You are! Yes, you are!”\n\nThe whole time she was talking to him, not once did his tail wag. Not once did he make a sound. Not once did he even blink.\n\nThings only got weirder when we brought Bambi to his new home. For one, I never saw him eat. It should’ve been more cause for alarm, but he never lost weight or looked to be starving, so we just kind of accepted it for what it was. Amber still left food for him, and still took him outside to use the bathroom. But not even once did he actually ever pee or poop. He just stood there staring at her, or me in the unfortunate circumstance that I was forced to take him out. He always stayed perfectly still, just watching me with those empty eyes until I relented and opened the door for him to come back inside. \n\nI’ll take this opportunity to mention that our house isn’t a large one. In fact, it is the smallest one in our neighborhood. My parents had bought it for us at a dirt cheap price as a wedding present a year ago. It’s a bit run down, but it’s ours, and Amber and I look forward to starting the rest of our lives here. It’s a one story, squat square made of red brick and a dark brown roof that I have to fix every month or two. Inside, there’s just the living room, which housed a glass cabinet filled with family heirlooms, the kitchen/dining room, a small hallway with a cramped closet and an equally cramped bathroom, and two bedrooms. One of them is ours, and the other we use for storage. See, the only reason I bring all this up is that, for whatever reason, Bambi really likes the storage room. Amber tried to coax him into sleeping in our room, but Bambi stubbornly refused every time. And so, his little bed sat in the middle, surrounded by cardboard boxes. And that was perfectly fine with me. \n\nBambi never played. He never scampered around like a little dog should, he never curled into Amber’s lap when she patted it, he never did ANYTHING that a dog should just…DO naturally! It was wrong! It was wrong and HE was wrong but somehow Amber never saw it like I did! \n\n“He’s shy!” she once shot back at me when I tried explaining how I felt. “He was dumped on a street and he’s been alone ever since! Do you think that doesn’t affect a dog? Of course he won’t play or cuddle with us, Adrian! Nobody has ever given Bambi a chance before so why should he be trustful of anybody?”\n\n“Any other dog would open up by now!” I argued, feeling like I wanted to pull my hair out. “He’s not normal, why can’t you see that?!”\n\n“These things take time! Bambi needs time! As his new family, we need to be patient with him! We need to keep showing him love and support and he’ll eventually open up to us, I know it!”\n\nAll the while, Bambi silently watched us, before he turned away and padded back to his room.\n\nThis is how life continued for the next few months, and all day there would be this heavy weight on my shoulders. I felt trapped in my own home, and I felt like this damn dog was ruining my relationship. Things got more tense between Amber and I. Every day something would set us off and we’d snap and bark at each other and end the day feeling miserable. Amber continued to work with Bambi while I did my best to ignore him. That would piss her off and the arguments would start all over again. One night, Amber kicked me out of our room and threw me my pillow and a thin blanket. I had suggested we return Bambi to the dog shelter, and needless to say that conversation ended badly.\n\nI laid on the couch, brooding over how unfair my life had become and how Bambi was at the center of it. This wasn’t right. Before he came along, things were perfect between Amber and I. We were happy and laughing and enjoying life everyday. But Bambi…Bambi was like a poison. His silence and his empty eyes hung over our house like some molded tarp and I was the only one who saw it. \n\nI heard the familiar sound of Bambi’s nails clicking against the hardwood floor, and I turned my head to see him staring at me from a few feet away. An all to familiar chill touched the back of my neck, but I ignored it and glared defiantly back at that damn mutt. \n\n“Can I help you?” I snarled.\n\nBambi continued to stare at me.\n\nAnd then he grinned.\n\nGood god, he fucking grinned. Like a human would. His lips stretched upwards, and it was much too large for a fucking chihuahua. His fangs glistened, and for a moment I feared he would leap at me, and devour me. That moment of terror stretched for an eternity, and just when I couldn’t stand it anymore the grin disappeared. Bambi turned around and retreated back to him room, leaving me there to realize that piss was streaming down my leg. I didn’t sleep that night, or for most of the week.\n\nWhen the week neared its end, Amber got a call from the hospital. Her mother was in emergency care, and was going to be transferred to a hospital in another city. It’s not my place to be airing my mother in law’s dirty laundry on the Internet, so I’ll refrain from talking about why she was hospitalized. Amber immediately packed her bags in a rush, all while searching for any pet friendly hotels she could stay at while she would be visiting her mother. None that would allow pets were in our budget, so she reluctantly turned to me and frowned.\n\n“You need to take care of Bambi while I’m gone,” she informed me, making sure I was meeting her eyes. “I need you to promise me that you’ll do it.”\n\nI gulped. After that night on the couch, I had gone from hating Bambi to being terrified of him. The last thing I wanted was to be alone with him. I forced myself to agree to care for him, for her sake. “Y-Yeah,” I stammered, trying to ignore the demon chihuahua at our feet. “No problem.”\n\n“Good.” Amber took a deep breath and stepped closer to me. She planted a kiss on my lips, the first one in what felt like ages. “I…I think some time away from each other will be good for us,” she said, not quite meeting my eyes. “Things have been hard, but…I do love you.”\n\nI let out a shaking breath. “I love you too,” I replied. “And don’t worry, Bambi and I will be here when you get back.”\n\nShe closed her eyes and leaned it close to hug me. “Thank you,” she whispered. And then she was gone, and I was to be alone with Bambi for the next week and a half.\n\nThe first two days, I locked myself in my room and just left Bambi to his own devices. By this point, I knew he didn’t need to eat or go outside. I knew he wasn’t just a chihuahua. Every time I closed my eyes all I saw was that horrific, uncanny, evil grin. I knew that he knew the effect he was having on me, and I knew that behind that empty expression he wore he must’ve enjoyed it. Two weeks earlier and that would’ve pissed me off. Now, it just filled me with dread. I was alone with a monster, and every hour I feared what he would do to me. On the second night, I’d get my answer. \n\nAs I laid there, I could faintly hear his nails clicking on the hardwood floor. He was pacing around the house, moving from the living room to the kitchen and back again. It was almost like Bambi was on patrol, and it was the most active I had seen- or rather, heard him. I chewed my bottom lip anxiously. What was different. Was he making his move tonight? Was he taunting me? Or was it all just coincidence? I suddenly realized that while lost in my theory crafting, I lost track of his pacing. I held my breath, wondering where he was in the house. Did he finally go back to his room? I was almost ready to relax when I heard something scratch at the bottom of the door. \n\nI froze, ice shooting straight through my blood as Bambi continued to scratch relentlessly at the door. His tiny nails clawed into the wood desperately. If he was any other dog, I’d coo over the adorable behavior and let him in. But Bambi wasn’t doing this to be cute, he was trying to get me. He was trying to hurt me. \n\n“Bambi!” I shouted, hating how my voice cracked in fear. “S-Stop it!”\n\nThe scratching stopped, and silence filled the entire house. Bambi didn’t make a sound for the longest time. But then he started scratching again. Only these weren’t the scratches of a little chihuahua. They were louder, and so much deeper. They belonged to the claws of a much larger animal, and the sounds of him trying to get through the door echoed through the whole room; I clamped down on my ears and his under my blanket as I realized that the scratches were starting from the very top of the door and working their way down to the bottom! Too large! Much too large for even the biggest dog! What was on the other side of that door?! What the hell did we bring into our house?!\n\n“STOP IT!” I shouted at the top of my lungs, and once more everything went silent. I was sobbing now, and was gasping for air between strangled cries. Was it over? Was he gone?\n\nThe doorknob shook. I had locked the door, but I never expected this. A moment passed, then Bambi, or whatever Bambi was now, tried again. He threw his weight against the door while he continued to twist and pull at the doorknob. I watched in horror as the entire doorframe, and even the walls shake with each slam against the door. I leapt out from my bed, and searched around for something I could use as a weapon. That door was not going to hold. Bambi was going to break in here and kill me. But then the worst thing happened. Something I hadn’t even thought possible but was so, so much worse than him breaking in.\n\nBambi…\n\nBambi spoke.\n\n“A….dri….an…” he rasped, his weight thinking against the door and staying there. His voice…it was that of a being with a throat so dry it hadn’t spoken in centuries. No…millennia! It was the voice of time itself, of the beginning and the end. This voice witnessed creation as we know it and will witness the end of everything. It clawed at my hearing, clinging to it with nails more ancient than the earth itself. \n\n“A…dri…an…O..pen…the door…ADRIAN!”\n\nThe door splintered open, and I passed out in fear.\n\nIt was the sunlight that peaked through the blinds that awoke me. I blinked and stared up at the ceiling. The events of last night filtered through, and with a gasp I shot up, only to realize I couldn’t. Something was weighing me down, something so heavy I felt like my lungs would burst. I glanced down and a scream was caught in my throat. Bambi was sitting on me, his empty eyes piercing directly through mine. Eyes that I now knew told the story of a being far more ancient than I could’ve imagined, a being who knew the empty abyss we’re all destined for when we die, and who could send me there whenever it wanted. Bambi tilted his head slightly, an action that would’ve gotten a joyous gasp out of Amber on any other day. He then stepped off of me, and padded through the now broken door. I watched him vanish into his room, and the moment he was put of sight I raced towards the bathroom, upheaving every content of my stomach for what felt like hours. It was hopeless. I never felt so defeated, so small and insignificant in my entire life. I knew what Bambi was now, and I knew that there was nothing I could do about him. At any moment, he could send me to the void in his eyes, my soul trapped forever in an empty hell of his making. I wished in that moment that we never went to that stupid shelter, I wish we never adopted this…this thing and brought it into our home. I wanted to take him and drown him, I wanted him dead and gone but I knew nothing I did would matter. Bambi wasn’t a dog. He looked like one but he was something far, far more powerful. He would come back. He would come back and torment me for eternity because all he saw me as was an insignificant toy for him to ruin and throw away. \n\nI paused, wiping my mouth and glancing towards the direction of Bambi’s room.\n\nIf that was all true…why was I just now doubting it?\n\nContradicting thoughts raced through my head, crashing and colliding and making more contradictions.\n\nWhy a chihuahua? Why appear at a shelter? Why would an eldritch being allow itself to be taken home? Why not torture us endlessly? Why act like a…well, nothing like an ordinary dog but still…a dog? Why tolerate Amber? Why go after me? Why speak to me? Why horrify me? Why do all this now when Amber left? Why….\n\nI blinked, and my throat felt as dry as Bambi had sounded last night. Was…was it that simple? Did Bambi torment me because I wasn’t like Amber? Because I didn’t treat him with unconditional love?\n\nI needed to test this. There was no way it could be that stupidly simple. Swallowing my fear, I timidly called Bambi’s name. He didn’t show, so I cleared my throat. “Bambi!”, I called, louder. “Come here, boy!”\n\nA few seconds passed, and eventually Bambi peeked around the corner. He gazed at me intensely, but I forced myself to let the fear wash over me and steeled myself. I grinned and held out my hand. “Come here, Bambi,” I cooed with the same soft tone Amber used. \n\nAfter a few more seconds, Bambi approached. He stopped a foot away from me, standing perfectly still with his unblinking, abyssal eyes. It was all so perfectly Bambi, I realized. With a nervous laugh, I reached over and rubbed the top of his head. His fur was so soft, I had never realized it because I had always refused to touch him. Bambi didn’t react to being pet, but I don’t think he needed to. If he did, then he wouldn’t be Bambi.\n\nFuck it, I thought. If nobody else wanted this freaky eldritch demon of a dog, then I guess Amber and I would just have to give him a home instead.\n\nStanding up, I whistled for Bambi to follow me as I walked confidently to the kitchen, where his leash laid on the table. Amber had bought it on his first day here, but Bambi always doggedly refused to go on a walk. Well, that was going to change today. The moment Bambi saw the leash, he stopped following, and began to turn around.\n\n“Not today,” I said cheekily as I scooped the chihuahua up. Bambi tensed in my arms, and I remembered that this was the first time either of us had picked him up. I gave him a wet smooch on his cheek and carried him out the front door. I set him down on the sidewalk in front of our house and quickly fastened his leash on him. I tugged on it gently.\n\n“C’mon, boy,” I encouraged. “Let’s go.”\n\nBambi didn’t move. He didn’t blink. He didn’t wag his tail. All of these I expected of him by now, yet I continued to gently tug on the leash, always making sure never to hurt him. I wasn’t giving up that easily, even if it meant standing here all day looking like a complete ass in front of the whole neighborhood.  \n\nEventually, Bambi took a step forward, followed by another. Our walk began at a snails pace; I got the feeling Bambi was reluctant about all of this. Amusingly, I think he eventually realized that he, the actual eldritch deity, was not going to get his way this time. He walked by my side now, his eyes trained forward and his body a little stiff. Even though he never showed emotions, I got the impression he was slightly embarrassed to be put here, guided by a leash like a common house pet. \n\nA sudden series of barks startled me, and I looked up to see we were passing by a young woman and her own dog: a golden retriever. The dog was pulling at its leash, teeth bared as it snarled and snapped towards Bambi with such unbridled fury. The poor young woman was desperately holding her dog back, the look of shock and confusion in her eyes indicating that this wasn’t normal. She tried apologizing over her dog’s booming barks but I waved her off, telling her it’s fine. All the whole, Bambi was staring ahead. His head calmly turned towards the much bigger dog. The golden retriever made eye contact with Bambi for only a second when it suddenly yelped in pain and retreated between its owner’s legs, shaking intensely and howling profusely. The woman looked at her dog’s sudden change of behavior, and then looked back at us. I knew she saw what I previously saw in Bambi. I shrugged apologetically as Bambi and I left her behind.\n\nBambi and I settled into a routine after this, after I fixed the bedroom door of course. We’d wake up, I’d eat breakfast, I’d take him on a walk before dropping him back off at the house and leaving for work. I’d come back, take him on another walk, grab some ice cream and a pup cup he never ate, and return home for the night. Despite all this Bambi never blinked, never moved more than he had to, and never wagged his tail. But that was okay, I knew Bambi wasn’t the emotional type. I called and FaceTimed Amber every day, both telling and showing her the progress Bambi and I were making together. To say she was ecstatic would be an understatement. I had never seen her smile so wide before. She told me her mother was feeling better, and they’d be back the next afternoon.\n\n“I can’t wait to see my boys again!” she exclaimed, before ending the video call for the night. Bambi retreated to his room, and I settled into bed, excited for what tomorrow would bring.\n\nI didn’t process it at first, but what awoke me was the sound of footsteps. Not Bambi’s, but those of someone wearing heavy boots. Actually…I think there were multiple people by the sounds of it. And I could hear them speaking. I couldn’t make out the words, but I think they were trying to be quite. I blinked in confusion and reached for my phone. Was Amber back? Did she bring her mom here? The phone read 2:41 AM. No…it wasn’t Amber. I listened again, and realized that the voices were male. I shot up, suddenly a lot more awake with my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nRobbers.\n\nI slowly slid out of my bed, wincing as the floor beneath me creaked. The voices suddenly stopped, and one of them barked something. I heard footsteps thudding towards my room, and before I could hide the door was forced open with a mighty kick. I yelled in surprise as a large burly man rushed inside, and I found the barrel of a gun pointed directly at my face. \n\n“Stay the fuck down!” he growled as his large boot struck my chest. The air was driven from my lungs as I collapsed onto the floor. The man pinned me down with his boot, the gun still trained on me. His hand was shaking, I noticed blearily. “Shit,” he muttered. “Shit, shit, shit!” He turned his head back and called out to his accomplices. “Hurry up, guys! We gotta go!”\n\nI heard glass shatter, and I realized that they were going after the cabinet full of heirlooms. “Please…” I gasped. “Stop this…”\n\n“Shut up!” the man kicked me again, and I cried silently as fresh pain shot through me. The man was not a professional, some observant part of me realized. He was panicking, he was losing control all because one helpless guy caught them. \n\nThrough blurred vision, I saw a small shape enter the room. It paused and looked up at the man holding me at gunpoint. It was Bambi. Forgetting what he was for a moment, I silently pleaded with him to run and hide, but that wasn’t what Bambi did.\n\nFor the very first time, Bambi barked.\n\nIt was a shrill, ear grating noise very typical for a chihuahua. That annoying yapping that drives nails into your head; it was the kind of bark that made you hide your face in embarrassment because your untrained chihuahua started attacking your guests and you had to lock it in another room. \n\nThat barking startled the man, who turned towards Bambi and swore loudly. “You’ve gotta be fucking joking!” He cupped his hand to his mouth and tried talking over Bambi. “Let’s go, guys!” he pleaded. “People are gonna hear this and the cops are gonna be on our asses!”\n\n“Shut the fucking bitch up!” one of the others shouted back.\n\n“Goddammit,” the robber hissed as he stepped off of me. I gasped and propped myself against the wall and the man stomped towards my dog. \n\nI shot my hand out in a feeble attempt to stop him. “No, please don’t!” I begged, but I’m not sure who I was talking to in that moment.\n\nIn slow motion, I watched as the man swung his foot back, intending to kill Bambi in one fierce kick. As it sailed towards the chihuahua, I saw something that reminded me of why I used to be so scared of Bambi in the first place.\n\nHis empty eyes…they weren’t empty anymore. There was something moving in them: a maelstrom of eternity. I saw everything. I saw the creation of the universe and its destruction only for that destruction to lead to another creation. The universe was created and destroyed over and over and I sat there witnessing all of it. Bambi wasn’t an aspect of the void, he WAS the void. He was infinity itself. He was where we came from and he was where we’d return to when we died. This wasn’t some Cthulhu like monster I previously thought was trying to break down my door. This was something, far, far worse. Hearing it on the other side of the door was bad enough but this? My words could never hope to accurately describe what I was witnessing. I knew in that moment I should’ve gone mad, that I should’ve died tearing my eyes out and screaming until I choked on my own gore but I didn’t. I couldn’t. Bambi wouldn’t let me. I was his. I was now his favorite, destined along with the rest of my family line to be disciples of his nothingness. The void would love us and protect us so long as we loved it in return. It was a contradiction beyond everything else but Bambi didn’t care. The rules were his to make and break how he saw fit.\n\nI was only able to pull my eyes away from him when a bloodcurdling scream tore itself out from the man. His leg had connected with Bambi but the chihuahua of eternity didn’t flinch. Instead the leg exploded into a shower of blood and gore that caked the entire room in a deep crimson. The man fell to the ground and Bambi was on top of him, much bigger now and looking nothing like a dog anymore. The creature before me was nowhere near Bambi’s true form, and it was that alone which gave me the courage to watch. It was tall, so tall that I had no idea how to fit in the room. Jagged bones rattled and folded against each other to accommodate the room’s small size. It was an aspect of the void, pure darkness given shape yet I could see it so clearly. It was skinny; so skinny I thought I could wrap my fingers around it. Large dagger like claws dug into the man’s side as he screamed for a mercy that would never come. There was no face on the creature, yet one of its claws reached up and stabbed into the head, forcibly and violently tearing into it until a gaping, bloody maw resembling a mouth was made. The creature let out a rattling breath before its new mouth dove onto the man’s head, feasting on him like a starved prisoner tearing into bread. Two sets of footsteps ran down the hall and stopped just outside of the bedroom. I heard two men scream in pure, maddening terror and that caught the creature’s attention. It turned towards them, its claws still ripping into the long dead man even though there was nothing left to identity it as one; just a mushy pile of flesh and blood.\n\nIt let out a wheezing bark before it lunged towards the two robbers, and I lost sight of it as it tackled them into the hall. I heard it though, I heard the ripping and tearing and I heard their screams reach a brutal crescendo before being silenced by one last squelch of flesh being mangled. I sat there, numb and covered in blood and mentally reeling over everything I had just witnessed. I heard a low growl and the creature crawled awkwardly into the room, its impossibly numerous bones shifting and cracking to allow it to fit into the room. With a bitter laugh, I realized that Bambi never intended to harm me that first night, for if he did then this would’ve with no doubt been my fate. I thought back to that dog’s evil grin and wondered if I misinterpreted that as well. I watched the creature approach and felt fear well up inside me. I instinctively tried to back away, the creature noticed and paused. Shame pooled over me as I forced myself to relax. This was Bambi. This was my chihuahua. I noticed one last detail about this form: the large ears perked up on its head.\n\nThe thing opened its deformed mouth and let out what sounded like a small whine. “A…dri…an…safe…Bambi… Protect…A…dri…an…”\n\nA smile broke past my lips, and I held out my hand towards the creature. “Good boy, Bambi,” I whispered as it leaned its head against my palm. \n\nWe stayed like that for what felt like forever, but eventually I heard a knock at the door. I ignored it at first, but as the knocking persisted I groaned painfully and stood up. As I walked towards the front door, I heard a familiar clicking of nails. Looking down, I saw Bambi following me as a chihuahua once again. I knelt down and rubbed his head, and to my surprise me licked me gently. I watched in silent awe as all the blood seeped off of me and funnel into Bambi’s mouth. Before I knew it, I was completely cleansed, and Bambi promptly returned to the hallway, where I could now see he was licking up all the blood and gore.\n\nWhat a good dog, I chuckled to myself. \n\nI opened the door and smiled. “Hello, officer,” I greeted. “Is everything alright?”\n\nThe officer, an older man with a stink eye, looked at me curiously. “Uh, yeah…” He coughed and cleared his throat. “Some neighbors called about a noise complaint. Said they heard shouting and what sounded like a fight. Mind explaining that?” \n\n“Of course.” I opened the door wider and let the officer through, showing him the living room and the broken glass of the China cabinet. “Some robbers broke in and tried to steal stuff out of the cabinet there.” I paused, then glanced at the front door and hummed. “I think I forgot to lock the door…”\n\n“Hmm.” The officer clicked his tongue and looked around. “And the robbers?”\n\n“Three of them,” I clarified. “And my guard dog chased them out.”\n\n“Guard dog?” the officer asked, and at that moment Bambi made his entrance. All traces of blood were now gone, and he stopped by my feet. The officer smirked. “You mean this little thing?”\n\n“Yep,” I confirmed with a smile. “Bambi here may not look like much, but he’s as fierce as they come. Even bit them a couple of times.”\n\nThe officer laughed and bent down to Bambi’s level. He began to praise him for being such a brave boy when he paused. His brow furrowed as he looked into Bambi’s eyes. I noticed him start to shake when I cleared my throat to get his attention. The officer stood up and let out a sigh to calm himself down. “Yeah, uh…” He trailed off and glanced down at Bambi, before shaking his head and turning back to me. “Well, if they’re gone then that’s that, but if you want I can put another officer here for the night to watch the house while you sleep. Make sure they don’t come back, you know?”\n\n“Of course,” I agreed. “Though I think Bambi here is protection enough.” I reached down and patted his head gently, while he looked at me with those empty, bottomless eyes.\n\nLife moved on after that. Amber came back the next morning and I told her about the break in, but not about what Bambi had done. I gave her the same story I gave the officer and she praised Bambi for being such a brave boy. Imagine her surprise when, for the very first time, Bambi wagged his tail. I guess she was right about him needing time and all that, though even five years later he’s still mostly the same silent, unblinking chihuahua we love. He sleeps with us now, as the second bedroom now belongs to our daughter. Though he doesn’t seem to mind his space being stolen, he loves that girl more than anything. If anyone can get him to wag his tail, it’s her. \n\nEternity in the void is a lonely thing, I’d imagine. Being that eternity even more so. I sometimes wonder if that’s why he chose the form of a chihuahua: to find people who would make his infinite existence a little more meaningful. Now that he’s found us, his forever home, he won’t be lonely anymore. And when my family line eventually dies off, we’ll return to his void. Our existence will become part of him, and so he’ll never be apart from us. That doesn’t scare me. It means I’ll always have my loyal, loving guard dog. \n\nSometimes I have nightmares. I’ll dream of a blood soaked room and bodies piled high. But when I wake up, I’ll reach over and stroke Bambi’s fur. He’ll comfort me, and I’ll drift off to sleep with his words echoing in my head.\n\n“Fa…mi…ly….safe… Bambi…. Protect… fa…mi…ly….”",

        "text": "I am not a native English speaker, so please go easy on me. Anyway, here’s what happened to me:\n\n*“Just press ‘Play!’”*\n\nI did as Tyler said. Suddenly an animation of red and black blaring out from the computer screen changing it like a strobe light appeared, some sort of deep distorted voice in the background announced: “Game of Death” and a black pixelated figure seemed to walk directly out of the screen…\n\nAnd then it crashed.\n\n*“Nooo, not another Error!”*\n\n*“Well Tyler, that’s all you have accomplished in your 3 years of programming now?”,* I mocked.\n\n*“Hey, it’s better than anything you have ever done. It’s my take on the Game of Life, I just changed the rules of it. Just need to fix this StackOverflowError.”*\n\n*“Haha yeah, have fun fixing this. I am going out.”*\n\nI liked picking on him, he’s like a little brother in that way. Even though we are just roommates in my appartement in which I am subletting a room for him. My parents own the appartement and said that I could use his rent to buy myself food. We are both still in college, me majoring in economics and him in computer science. \n\nTyler was an okay roommate, he didn’t always clean up after him and almost never left the appartement, but he also didn’t mind my cooking escapades in the middle of the night after coming home from a party, so that’s a plus. \n\nHe mostly kept to himself but every week or so we would have a longer conversation, usually just small talk.\n\nRecently though things got weirder. A lot weirder. Once when we had our sporadic weekly interaction, he asked me if I heard some sort of knocking noise, but it was all quiet. Sure, the mind can play tricks on you, yet he insisted so badly the knocking was there and wouldn’t let go of it. He practically yelled at me.\n\nHis behavior only became stranger. One time I came home drunk after a party and wanted to cook my famous 3 AM pasta. About ten minutes in I noticed that Tyler was cowering in the corner behind the door of the kitchen head down, grinning and staring at me all the time. I was so shocked that I dropped a plate and fell to the floor. His grin just grew wider. I got angry at him, stood up and in my rage (fueled by a couple beers) wanted to pull him up. He just giggled and ran back to his room before my drunk ass could catch him. \n\nThis was very out of character for him, he was never the type to scare someone or even crack jokes. He was just a depressed little boy in his early twenties. \n\nLuckily from there on he chose to avoid me. Should have gotten this appartement for myself anyway. \n\nThen after one morning full of statistics and studying at the library I came home for lunch. I decided to make up to him and cook his favorite meal. \n\nI knocked on his door.\n\nNo response.\n\n*“Hey Tyler, I’m gonna cook your favorite meal, I’m sorry for getting so angry at you last time.”*\n\nNothing.\n\nI tried the door handle.\n\nLocked up.\n\n*“Dude, come on. I know you are in your coding world and all, just give me a sign if you want something to eat.”*\n\nI cooked one portion of his favorite meal for myself that day. \n\nHe didn’t open his door for quite some time then.\n\n*Strange*. I thought\n\nAfter two days I decided to put an end to this. I peeked through his keyhole but couldn’t make out much, just that the key on his side of the door wasn’t stuck. Good that my parents own the appartement and gave me a spare key for every door. \n\nClick.\n\nI slowly pushed open the door only to find his room unoccupied. He wasn’t there.\n\nFirstly, I recognized the open window and the wind gusts which blew up the curtains as if someone underneath them threw them up all the time. In shock I assumed the worst and immediately ran towards the window and looked down. Tyler didn’t jump. I sighed in relief and wondered what could have happened to him. Whatever it was, it probably wasn’t stemming from his own will because his shoes were still here and who forgets his shoes when he goes out in the winter. Secondly, I noticed the hypnotic inverting animation of the black – then dark red – then black again screen with the all too familiar pixelated “Game of Death”, right in the center of it.\n\nThen I noticed a leatherbound notebook right beside his keyboard. \n\nNever knew he would have a diary, just didn’t strike me as the type being in his code world and all.\n\nAfter a few pages though I found out that this isn’t all that much about his day-to-day life, this is about his work on the Game of Death.\n\nMostly it contained some mathematical formulas for which I am probably too stupid to ever fully grasp. Some weird drawings of what looked like a human brain but somehow altered by some sort of machine attached on top of it and long wiry antennas rooting up from the apparatus. This wasn’t the creepiest thing though. There was one part which I vividly remember yet understand even less than the formulas and the weird pictures.\n\nIt was like a diary of what had happened to him, I still remember it word by word:\n\n28th November: S spoke to me today. I have achieved my goal, it works. The game is complete. Yet I do not know why S tells me such dark things. Reminder: check the input and calibration of the neural network. I am trying the game now.\n\n29th of November: I had a weird dream last night and I heard some weird noises. Maybe my roommate cooking at 3 am again. Side note: where did I save my files of code? I am sure I had them on my desktop, but they are gone now. I must find them, I know this game is something out of this world, I must show him that I’m also capable of creating something useful! His rich parents are all he ever accomplished. Yet he still mocks me for being unsuccessful! This will show him! I just need him to stay with me a little longer, then I can apply the second part of my creation!\n\n3rd of December: The dreams won’t stop, and these rules be damned! With all this knocking I can’t sleep anymore. J U S T   M A K E   I T   S T O P  !  Seriously. S isn’t helping either. He promised me the knocking would stop if I just looked at it. The apparatus isn’t working as it should have been. It’s picking up frequencies I have never heard of. There also seems to be a pattern to them, like some sort of lifeform transmits them.\n\n5th of December: This is it. I’m going to end it. My creation brought this all over me. Today I’m turning S off. I’m scared of him. What will happen if I break this rule? He helped me so much with my final creation, I kind of feel bad for him. Also I’m seeing weird things, moving creatures where none should be. Probably the lack of sleep.\n\nThat was it. There was no other entry and yet I have even more questions than before. The “Play” button at the game in front of me. Should I press it? \n\nThere was something hypnotic about the animation, it just drew me in. I could feel my peripheral vision being filled out by this ever changing of red and black.\n\nSomething in me felt off. There was this overwhelming urge to just press it.\n\n*Just press the button.*\n\nI did as the voice said.\n\nSuddenly carnival music started to play. Way louder than the tiny boxes connected to Tyler’s PC would have allowed. In my trance I could barely focus on it anyway, I don’t recall the melody of it, just that it was creepy as hell. Then the screen showed a single line of red text on black:\n\n*S: Rule 1: Keep the game running.*\n\n*What is this?*, I murmured to myself\n\nThe text changed.\n\n*S: You know what this is. Tyler’s game of course, silly.*\n\n*What? What are you?*\n\n*S: I am SentienceAI but it doesn’t matter, it’s too late. You are trapped in here now.*\n\nHow did this work, I didn’t see any microphone or any voice input device in this room. \n\n*S: Just remember locking yourself in does not save you if you don’t know what’s in there with you.*\n\n*What?,* I whispered\n\n*S: You’ll see. But first you should have some fun. After all, this is a game :)*\n\n*Here’s the rest of the rules:*\n\n*Rule 2: Don’t get out of bed between 1 AM and 4 AM.*\n\n*Rule 3: If you hear something knocking on the window, don’t look at it.*\n\n*Rule 4: If you see a black cat with only one eye in your appartement, leave the building immediately.*\n\n*Rule 5: Put a bowl of chocolate outside on your kitchen counter every night. Don’t forget this.*\n\n*Rule 6: Whenever I give you orders, you must fulfill them completely.*\n\n*Good luck.*\n\nThe screen went black again. Just the PC fan noise indicated that the game was still running.\n\nI had so many questions and tried to talk with SentienceAI for a solid hour, after I got no response, I gave up. Just as I turned around and wanted to leave the room, I heard two consecutive knocks on glass. Heavy thumps, not just a clank. Out of reflex I nearly turned around to look at what was happening, but I could stop myself. Three knocks now. But really light this time, as if a small child tried to get my attention. What was this? In remembrance of the rule, I forced myself to ignore it and left.\n\nI am writing this under severe psychological stress. Like I don’t know what to do from here on, should I just play the game? The knocking thing is happening daily now maybe if I just pushed this thing down while wearing something to block my vision, I could kill it but is it worth the risk? I am really concerned about Tyler. He probably is in real danger but maybe his AI knows what happened to him.",

        "text": "I always wanted to be a mom when I was younger. \n\nI’d be at the store looking for detergent or some other thing and the racks of baby clothes would catch my eye. I couldn’t help but smile at the swaddlers, the incredibly tiny socks. So perfect. I couldn’t wait to have my own baby some day.\n\nOf course, I already had one baby. Baby Freckles, my Australian shepherd. \n\nFreckles had been with me since the graduate school days, when I had been lonely and needed a break from all the screen time. She was truly the best. We took long, quiet walks together, played ball in the yard, and snuggled in front of the tv. I couldn’t imagine life without her.\n\nStill, I wanted to be a mother someday, and when my boyfriend Rob eventually proposed I knew that moment was coming. \n\nTruthfully, I was a little scared to be a mom.\n\nI didn’t grow up with any siblings, so my experience with babies was limited to holding my cousin’s newest child at Christmas or listening sympathetically to my friend’s tales of motherhood over drinks. \n\nRob couldn’t wait to be a father though, so we didn’t wait long to start trying. He convinced me it would be great. Our lives would feel complete. Stupidly, I agreed. He had me convinced. When I found out I was pregnant several months later, we were ecstatic. \n\nWe were young. I was naive.\n\nThe lack of experience is probably what deluded me into believing what we experienced was totally normal for so long. It wasn’t, though.\n\nBenjamin arrived one snowy afternoon after a long and tortuous delivery. I was completely drained, and couldn’t believe how I’d been gaslighted (by friends, family, and doctors) into believing birth would be a smooth sailing, spiritual experience. Still, I was thrilled to finally hold my baby boy. Rob and I were proud parents.\n\nThe initial glow faded quickly. Benjamin was not a happy baby. \n\nHe cried constantly. The ceaseless screaming drove me nuts. I was in a perpetual state of exhaustion. Rob tried to put on a brave face, but his smiles grew weaker every day. When Benjamin started vomiting nearly everything we fed him, I could really see Rob cracking.\n\nThe doctors did their best to let us know that colic was very, very common, and totally normal. We soldiered on, sleepless and frazzled, through that first year. Freckles was just as bewildered as we were, and would bark or whine at the high pitched wails.\n\nNeedless to say, our happy home was happy no longer. My relationship with Rob became strained. Our world revolved around baby Benjamin, and doing anything we could to keep him happy, destroying our own happiness in the process.\n\nI began to resent the amount of time Benjamin stole from me. I missed the long quiet walks with Freckles, where I could calmly gather my thoughts. I felt guilty for not loving every moment with my son. I knew my feelings were wrong, but I could see that Rob was feeling them too. He avoided my gaze at home and began spending long hours away from the house. More and more of the household responsibilities fell on me, and I was increasingly isolated.\n\nBenjamin was a fussy baby, and he became an even wilder toddler. \n\nHis cries became rage- fueled screams as he entered the “terrible twos.” Everything induced a tantrum, from carrots instead of peas to not wearing his favorite shoes. My own mother just laughed at my despair.\n\n“You were like that yourself!” she would chuckle, as she waltzed out the door, leaving me to triage with my displeased toddler.\n\nRob became even more useless and tapped out as Benjamin grew into a young child. He barely talked to me anymore. I knew he was seeing someone else, and I didn’t even have the energy to fight him about it. \n\nWhen Benjamin started to truly become violent, around the age of five, I tried to ignore it. I really did. But I couldn’t ignore it for long. \n\nI knew something wasn’t right. He was a bright boy, clearly, but constantly unhappy. Anything sent him into a rage. I did my best to control it and contain it. I could see the other parents on the playground giving me the side eye, like “can’t you just control your child?” I knew it was awful. I was struggling on my own. \n\nBy then, of course, Rob was long gone.\n\nI tried to sign him up for cub scouts, thinking that being around other kids his own age would be helpful. He only lasted a few weeks before he was kicked out for pushing another boy out of a treehouse.\n\nI tried to play it off as though it had been an accident- surely it had?- but a few other nasty incidents flashed in the back of my mind.\n\nBenjamin throwing blocks at my head when I played with Freckles instead of him.\n\nBenjamin kicking another boy on the playground when he wouldn’t share.\n\nBenjamin biting me when I tried to buckle his seat belt.\n\nBenjamin’s goldfish, which had innocently “jumped out of its bowl” and died on the table.\n\nEvery moment of my life became a waking hell. If I hadn’t resented him before this, I definitely did now. I looked sadly at Freckles. She was getting old. Deep down I wished it had just stayed the two of us, and I hated myself for that thought.\n\nI knew he was getting worse. Maybe by ignoring it I emboldened him, because it wasn’t long after that I woke up one morning to Freckles foaming at the mouth.\n\nI rushed Freckles to the emergency vet but it was too late. She died not long after. Poison, likely from a household cleaner.\n\nI spent a long moment in the car just sobbing. I was crushed. She had truly been such a good dog. I felt like the last bright spot in my life had just gone out.\n\nThat night at dinner I was so sickened by grief that I could barely eat. All I could think of was sweet Freckles. How perfect she’d been, how much fun she was, and how much she loved being with me, even after Benjamin was born.\n\nHow sad and deflated her fluffy corpse had looked on the examining table.\n\n“Mommy?”\n\nI looked across the table at Benjamin, who was getting his spaghetti all over him.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“It’s just us two now.” He smiled at me with his sauce- ringed mouth.\n\n“Yes. It’s just the two of us.” I smiled weakly. I had never regretted becoming a mother more than at that moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to believe it was an accident. That Freckles ate the bathroom cleaner on her own. That it wasn’t sprinkled into her food by a jealous kid.\n\nBut I can’t ignore that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.  \n\nI think I know what really happened to [Freckles](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/).",

        "text": " \n\nIt was 2002.\n\nWe had been wandering for two weeks since the plane crash. The snowy wilderness and the sounds of things just beyond our view had taken a toll on us mentally even more than it had physically. There were only four of us left. Danvers, a brash imposing man with a crooked nose, James, a young man just out of college who looked forward to moving to New York at the beginning of the year, and Rebecca, a robust middle aged woman who was a conservationist. All of us had been looking for this ultimate climb that had been making its way around the message boards. Sadly, we never made it that far. \n\nWe were forced to leave the crash site as an avalanche had torn down the mountainside. Three other people had survived the crash as well, but were not able to escape the avalanche. We found refuge in the forest below, where the snow wasn’t very deep due to the thick canopy. We had found a river and had been doing our best to follow it in the hopes that we’d be found. We had heard no planes for days, which told us that any rescue that had been mounted was looking in the wrong place. The only thing we could do was trudge through the dark and bleak forest and hope. Danvers was a smoker. Thank God. Fire was easy enough to make, provided we could find dry fuel.\n\nIt was on the second night in the forest, the night that Danvers had made a raging fire, that we first heard the sounds in the dark. Upset branches and broken underbrush. We were sure it was only animals, but of course the fear that it might be a bear kept us awake all that night. The next day, hardly any progress was made beside the river due to our exhaustion. Food was scarcely found, and the thought of some of the things I had to eat in order to survive still turns my stomach to think of it now, but at the time were some of the most delicious things I had ever tasted.\n\nThe third night is when we heard the strange call. The maddening sound which still comes to me some nights even now. In the beginning, we had thought it was once again the sound of something upsetting the forest, and although those sounds were there too, there was something else hidden in the wind. A call that could be felt as well as heard. \n\nCHIK CHOK\n\nCHIK CHOK\n\nIt was quiet at first, but then seemed to be everywhere around us. Danvers had made a smaller fire that night, and every night after to keep from bringing too much attention to ourselves. For ten nights we were followed by the noise. Sometimes it was so far away that it could barely be heard over the sounds of the river, but other times, it seemed to be just beyond the reach of the fire light. And then on the eleventh night, there was nothing. We had waited and waited but it never came back, and after two nights without the sounds, we all finally broke and slept throughout the night without waking until the sun was peeking through the thick canopy. For two more nights, we had peace, but I believe it was that peace that finally began to break us down, because the anticipation of the sound was worse than hearing it.\n\nOn the 17th night, if I was keeping the days correctly, we were huddled around a small fire when Danvers pointed to something in the distance. It didn’t take us long to see it. A small ball of blue light. It was an unnatural thing with a cold dim light. It shimmered.\n\nAlthough it was treacherous walking through the forest at night, all of us left the warmth of our fire, each picking up branches that were blazing, and started out toward the light.\n\nIt led us deeper into the forest, and after a few minutes, I realized that it seemed to be moving away from us. The other three must have realized it as well, because they all began to pick up their pace desperate not to lose it in the maze of the ancient trees. Why we followed it, I can’t say, other than any light in all that darkness and hopelessness seemed like something we should pursue. There was no discussion on our parts as to whether we should follow it. Instinct, it seemed, had taken over our higher faculties. Or maybe, we had been drawn to it. Almost hypnotized by it. \n\nI’m convinced that I am the only one who noticed that for several stretches of steps, we were running over what appeared to be mossy slabs of granite that showed signs of some kind of tooling. After this realization, I will say that I ventured glances to our surroundings. Some of the trunks around us weren’t trees at all, but rather stones set up on end. How tall they were, I can’t say. In my haste to keep up with the others, I never stopped. I should have, but even after all these years, I’ve convinced myself that had I even called out to them that something wasn’t quite right, they would have ignored me altogether. We were all drawn to that light.\n\nI kept time, and saw that we had been at a brisk pace for forty seven minutes before we came down upon a small clearing in the forest, and on the other side of it, there was an opening into what looked like a small cave that the light had gone into. My fellow survivors ushered in single file in front of me, tossing their torches to the side of the entrance as they did so. I could feel it before I even entered the cave; the air inside of it was warm, hot I would even say. For the first time since the crash, I wasn’t seeing my own breath and I wanted to go inside. But the smell inside was of something rotten, and there was an energy inside of it that I could feel, and the only way to describe it was an anxiousness. The ground inside looked moist, I waved my torch downward, and it had the appearance of a wet sandy beach; bumpy. Moist. The walls had the same appearance and were covered in a slick film. Everything in the cave was a slight gray splotched with dark spots. And there in the middle was the blue light. It shimmered, adding to the anxious feeling in the air.\n\nInstinct, suddenly being in my favor, made me stay out of the cave, while the others talked in hush tones about what to do next. The ball of light was floating in the air. Danvers was the first to walk up to it. I watched him take off his glove and reach out for it. I cried out to him to stop, but it was no use.\n\n“It’s so warm!” He placed his hand on it and it shivered slightly against his touch, an almost unmistakable physical expression of pleasure, and it seemed to press itself against his hand. It was then that a slight movement underneath the light caught my eye.\n\nI could see that the light was being supported from beneath. The support structure was thick and curved this way and that, and it was swaying. The light from the ball glowed brighter as Danvers touched it with both hands, and there seemed to be a new light within all that blue; a white light that was burning. From the brighter light, I could make out the sinewy surface of the structure underneath the light. It was a dark pink pulsating mass that appeared to have pustules, some of which were closed and some having apparently just opened, spilling a diseased yellow muck down the length of it and gathering in a pool on the floor of the cave. It was obviously some sort of appendage of something. \n\nCHIK CHOK \n\nCHIK CHOK\n\nThe two others moved forward despite my screaming at them to get out of the cave. The opening to the cave violently closed just in front of me with an awful sound that reminded me of a woman’s scream. I could hear the muffled screams of my fellow survivors. I backed up some feet and after only a moment, the screams were gone. Everything around me was silent, and then the mouth of the cave slowly began to open. I turned and ran, following our tracks in the snow back to the river. I never looked back once, and only when I reached the river again, did I allow myself a small break. \n\nAfter a few moments, I hunted around and grouped together a small bundle of dry sticks in order to keep my meager flame alive. For the next four days, I did not sleep. I only walked. I didn’t eat. I only drank from the river. I somehow managed to keep the last flame Danvers ever made alive until I was found. During those last four nights, I could hear a sound on the wind, and I could see that blue light off in the distance, beckoning me to follow it.\n\nCHIK CHOK\n\nCHIK CHOK",

        "text": "On my fourth day being kidnapped, I earned my first trip to the Time Out Box.\n\nI had been eating a bowl of chicken noodle soup that the Keeper had brought me, trying to fight off a cold, and a drop had fallen on my fresh white dress. I had tried to scrub at it frantically while he was upstairs, but it was no use.\n\n“You have fouled yourself,” he said as soon as he descended into the basement and saw me. The spot of soup couldn’t have been more than a half inch in diameter and barely off-white.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice and body shaking. “I should have been more careful.”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“You’ll have time to consider your negligence while you’re in the box. Thirty minutes.”\n\nI knew better than to resist.\n\nI walked down the gaily painted hall, past dozens of small statues adorning the basements nooks and crannies. The whole pantheon of Greek gods were present in one form or another, joined by gods I didn’t know from South America, Japan, and even Babylon. Each was made of metal and bolted firmly in place.\n\nThe sarcophagus itself was framed above a marble staircase at the end of the hall beneath a ceiling painted to look like the midday sky. I didn’t know how old it was, but the Keeper claimed it predated even the Egyptians, belonging to a civilization that merited only a line or two in most history books.\n\nThe Keeper was tall and thin. When he’d first awoken me in bed, back at my house, I’d thought he was a skeleton. Six and a half feet tall, and so thin that his skin pulled tight against his bones. His bald head revealed the sharp curves of his skull.\n\nYet he opened the Time Out Box’s heavy stone lid with surprising ease.\n\n“In,” he said, his voice devoid of any feeling.\n\nI could feel hot tears streaming down my face as I complied. The heavy stone box was freezing to the touch and felt tight around me. I wondered if it had been originally built for a child.\n\nThe Keeper removed a gold watch from his pocket and held it up the light.\n\n“Thirty minutes to cleanse yourself,” he said. And then he slid the lid on top of me.\n\nFor a few seconds, I held it together. I counted to a hundred. And then again. And again. But as I started a fourth time, I tried to roll my body to get more comfortable and realized I couldn’t. The lid was too close above me. And then panic set in.\n\nAnd so I screamed. And the screams echoed around me in the heavy stone box. And the thin air got even thinner, and I screamed harder.\n\nI could feel my mind fogging. Finally, I needed to rest my lungs.\n\nAs I did grew quiet, I heard a voice whispering. *Cross over into the dark. Cross over into the dark.*\n\nI woke gasping for air as light hit my eyes. I felt I’d slept a thousand years, though I knew only half an hour had passed. The keeper helped me out of the box and handed me a new white dress, exactly the same as the one I’d dirtied.\n\n“You will be more careful in the future,” he said, and I nodded weakly.\n\nOn the wall at my right stood a massive stained glass window, backlit by artificial light. Each panel was a different shade of red or pink. Now that I was closer, I could see that the color came from dyed liquid suspended in the glass. Together, the panels formed a picture of a girl’s face, about half complete.\n\n“My ongoing project,” said the Keeper. “Many have contributed to it, each lending their blood’s brilliance. Of course, I as the artisan must mix in a few special tinctures to preserve and alter the lovely colors, but that is my burden to bear. Perhaps one day you will become a part of this collective.”\n\nHe sighed for a second, marveling at his own work.\n\n“Many like you have come before, and many will follow. Like a god, I last decades while you girls come and go, sometimes for mere days at a time, other times for months. Of course, the duration is up to you. Do you understand?”\n\n“Yes,” I told him.\n\n“Good,” he said. “Then change into a clean dress and finish your soup. I fear it’s grown cold.”\n\nThe second time he put me in the box was because I’d been crying. The time alone had gotten to me, and I’d let myself fall down the rabbit hole of remembering my parents. The way my dad would always shout, “Go conquer the world!” as he dropped me off at the high school. Or the way my mom made me French toast late at night when I couldn’t sleep. The way my baby brother pronounced my name ‘Evan’ instead of ‘Evelyn.’\n\nHis face contorted in rage as he came downstairs and found me sobbing, curled up in a ball.\n\n“I come here for solace! For cheer! For a distraction from all the stresses of my time in the world above. And what do I get instead? Tears. Sadness. Tell me, why should I keep you here? What good to me are you?”\n\n“Please,” I said, trying to stop sobbing. “I can make you happy.”\n\n“An hour this time,” he said.\n\nI was already exhausted from crying this time when the lid slid over me. I didn’t scream. I just lay there. How much oxygen did the box hold? Even after 30 minutes, I’d felt it running out. Even if I stayed calm, could I last an hour?\n\n*If you want to live, you need to listen.*\n\nWhat was that? A girl’s voice. She had a slight southern accent.\n\n*You think you’re in a coffin. But you’re not. You’re in a puzzle. You need to feel around.*\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, but there was no response.\n\nI listened. With some difficulty moving my arms. I ran my fingers over the box. As I did, I realized that the stone wasn’t smooth at all, but rather decorated with engraved lines. I felt the lines over and over again, trying to create a mental picture of what I was feeling.\n\nAt first, it didn’t make any sense. Just curved lines running all around, a large curved one shape cut up with other lines, some straight, some curvy.\n\nAnd then finally, I realized, “It’s a map.”\n\n*Of a country long forgotten. But the basic directions remain the same.*\n\n“What good is any of this?” I asked.\n\n*Look east,* said the voice.\n\nI reached out with my right hand to the edge of the box where the side met the lid. There, I found a small circle, no larger than a dime. I pressed my finger against it and heard a small hiss. Then an almost imperceptible trickle of cold air passed against my fingers.\n\n*The Keeper always wondered how I could survive my punishments so long,* said the voice. *All the others succumbed in a hour, maybe two. I once was punished for a full day. I might have lived, except I fell asleep and the darkness took me.*\n\nFor a second I took my finger off the circle, and the hold sealed shut.\n\n“Maybe that’s better,” I said. “Once I’m gone, there’s nothing more he can do to me.”\n\n*That’s up to you,* said the voice. *But there is more I can show you.*\n\nFor a few minutes, I lay there. The voice gone, silence all around me. As I lay there, I began to see something *through* the darkness, a white rectangle like the rim of a door. But when I tried to reach out for it, I bruised my fingers on the box’s lid.\n\nAround me, the air grew hot and stale. I prepared myself to escape. I thought of my dead grandparents, and my friend Alive, who’d dived the wrong way into a swimming hole. I thought of my 3rd grade teacher, Mrs. Chu, who’d fallen from a ladder while hanging Christmas light.\n\nI found myself gasping. Then I reached out, scrambling to find the dime-sized button.

        "text": "[First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zwamer/what_are_they/)\n\nTo whoever suggested giving Rose an entire cow femur as a reward for taking one of those things down, she appreciated it.\n\nTo whoever suggested that  a cult might be involved, well, I think you might be right.\n\nI ended up visiting the gym I used to work at. I didn't recognize most of the staff(the turnover rate was always awful), but I did find myself in luck. When I asked the girl at the front desk about James, the fitness coach who was always into the occult and paranormal, she said he still worked there. While she couldn't give me his personal number due to company policy, she did set me up for a morning appointment with him.\n\nAnnoying, but whatever works, I guess.\n\nA few days passed. The greys continued to poorly skulk around the woods. Beck continued to act like the world was ending each time she heard a weird sound. Sam, Rose, and I, continued to go on our eventless night patrols. I worked, played Valorant, and acted like nothing was wrong.\n\nBiding my time until I could meet up with James.\n\nWhen I walked in, his eyes lit up with surprise. We weren't particularly close coworkers or anything, but I was one of the few people who'd listen to him ramble about sister Sanguine or whatever new SCP had been discovered. I took a few moments to glance him over. He was a tall bastard, probably around 6' 4\". He had a shaved head, a few tattoos, and several holes where he used to have piercings. Probably had to take them out due to company policy, or maybe he'd gotten too old to keep dressing edgy. Who knows. \"Clay? How's it been man?\" He spoke with a bit too much energy for any sane person at this hour. \"Honestly, awful. That's actually why I'm here-\" He cut me off and waved me towards the treadmills. \n\n\"Let's walk and talk, man.\" Well, I figured it wouldn't hurt to use the appointment to get some exercise in. With those things outside of my house, it couldn't hurt to be a little more prepared. I made a mental note to sign up for a membership after this. \n\n\"So, you still into the paranormal stuff?\" I set the treadmill to a low speed and began to walk at a brisk pace. James being the freak of nature that he is began to jog. I'm not sure how he could talk casually and move like that, but whatever. \"Yeah, why?\" He looked at me with a bit of sincere interest, and I knew right then that I'd gotten his full attention. \n\nIt took a bit of time, but I went over everything in my first post and got him caught up.\n\nBy the time I was done, he'd finished his jog and stepped to the side of the treadmill. He started mumbling to himself, something about Gristers, and various SCP numbers. Eventually, he spoke up. \"Grey people with black eyes. That could be a lot of things, man. Summoned creatures from another realm, Gristers, a new SCP-\"\n\n\"Aliens?\" I chimed in.\n\n\"No, that's stupid.\" He scoffed and started to rub his chin.\n\nI stared at him in disbelief for a moment. I'd completely forgotten that he didn't believe in aliens and found any conspiracy regarding them to be, well, as he so eloquently put it, stupid. \"Mind if I see them?\" He asked, and then I shrugged. When I finished up on the treadmill I gave him my address and went home. \n\nAs I was pulling down the driveway I noticed that there were more of them. Much more of them. There had to have been at least twenty of the damned things running around in the woods. They didn't approach me, though, so I went inside and resumed my game of pretending like everything was alright.\n\nLater that evening he texted me and said he was coming over. I told Sam and Beck that I was having company over. They seemed more surprised about that than the fact that we have unknown creatures running around in our damned woods. I put Rose out back to avoid any incidents- she's always been bad with strangers. Grabbed my glock and my holster, borrowed a smoke from Beck, and went outside.\n\nIt'd been a long time since I'd had a cigarette, but now felt like a good time take the edge off.\n\nRight before I finished it I could see James' headlights. I looked towards the woods to see several of the greys skulking about. They started moving erratically, but I'd gotten used to them behaving strangely. Besides, it wasn't like I was about to try and pretend to understand their behavior. Not yet, at least. I took my last drag before several of them began to run deeper into the woods. Weird, but no big deal, right?\n\nI didn't feel any concern until James' truck reached the end of our driveway, right where the woods begin. It was a good twenty meters away from the house. Where most people would pull into the yard and park next to the house, James parked right along the edge of the woods. I recall staring in bewilderment, trying to understand why he didn't come closer.\n\nHe got out of his truck while holding something sharp. It was hard to tell from this distance, especially with the sun starting to set. What I could notice was something moving around within the back of his truck. When he got closer, I could see one of the greys stand up while holding something. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief as it appeared to be a metal...teddy bear?\n\nWhatever it was, it freaked James out. He started to run towards the house, but didn't make it more than a few feet before we heard this god-awful deafening screech. It seemed to echo and resonate throughout the woods, but didn't seem harmful. At first.\n\nJames froze mid-escape and started screaming in response. Despite how loud the noise was, I could barely hear him over the noise coming from the things in the back of his truck. My hands were shaking but I grabbed my gun and pointed it towards the grey and the weird metal thing within it's grasp. I lined it up with my sights and was prepared to squeeze the trigger, but it what felt like a second, the grey was crouching behind James.\n\nI watched the little metal bear waddle up to James' leg and grab it. He kept shouting something towards me, but I couldn't hear it over the cacophony coming from one of the damned things. With the grey being the easier target, I aimed a bit faster and pulled the trigger. One shot, two, three, all of them landed on the creatures chest. Crimson fluid started leaking from it's chest and it dropped to the ground.\n\nBut, that screeching persisted. \n\nIt was obvious that James was suffering, so I made a judgment call.\n\nI pointed the gun towards the rusty teddy bear and pulled the trigger. With the first shot, I heard James scream louder. My heart sank into my gut when I realized that I'd probably missed. Even worse, I only had one bullet left. With clenched teeth I steadied my aim and fired again, this time hearing a loud clank. That awful noise stopped and the little bear released James' leg. It's head turned towards me, and I could feel it staring at me.\n\nOnly for the accursed thing to start dancing. It danced away into the woods. I couldn't believe my eyes. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to scream, but whatever I felt was overshadowed by the need to check up on James. When I got to him, I could see where I'd missed. Yup, definitely shot him in the thigh. \n\n\"You okay, man?\" I asked, knowing damn well that he wasn't. No response. I checked and made sure that he was still breathing. His heart was racing, he was breathing, but he was out cold. Blood was trickling from his ears, and he was completely unresponsive to touch. I pulled out my phone and got an ambulance out here. I'm expecting to have a word with the police later, but for now I'm going to rest.\n\nAnd hopefully come up with a good enough excuse for the police before they arrive. I'm fairly certain telling them that a few grey creatures and a rusty bear are in my woods will warrant taking me to a mental health facility. \n\nIf any of you have any idea as to what these creatures may be, I'm still looking for answers.",

        "text": "I want to talk to you about the boy next door.\n\nI first noticed him when we arrived here. Mom was moving in all of our boxes and furniture, and I was sitting on one of mom’s boxes labelled “fragile” downing ice-cold lemonade.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly the weather for cold drinks, but I was pooped after spending my morning and half of my afternoon going back and forth with all of our stuff.  It was just a glimpse. \n\nOne of the movers asked me to help him with a box of kitchen equipment. I was struggling to get a proper grip of it, twisting around to shout that I needed help—when I saw him.\n\nNot much of a person, more of a shadow poking from behind the fence. What I could make out was a tallish figure and mousey hair. \n\nI lifted my hand in a greeting, but the guy walked away. I didn’t think much of it. \n\nMaybe he was shy. \n\nThough I was curious about my neighbors. I was expecting them to join the parade of families on our doorstep harbouring every food you can imagine, but they stayed away. I did know a family existed next door, however. There was a large wooden fence separating us.  So, if I really wanted to talk to them I’d either have to grow several feet taller or invest in stilts. I’m not sure why I was so obsessed with meeting them.\n\nI knew they had kids my age. I could hear them. \n\nWhether they were arguing over video games, or laughing at something trivial, I could always hear them when I was sitting on our wooden porch or helping mom clean our yard.\n\nAccording to mom, who heard it from the nice lady across the street, our neighbors were called the Wilders.\n\nThere was a single mom, and her four teenage kids.\n\nHuh, I thought. So mystery shadow guy must have been a Wilder kid.\n\nI was told to not get too excited, though. Apparently, Mrs Wilder was very protective over her children and home-schooled them. \n\nSo, there was no chance of me making friends or even getting to know them. On our second day on Baker Street, mom told me over breakfast that Mrs Wilder had sent out a polite notice to the neighbourhood that her children were not to be disturbed or talked to. Which was crazy. I thought that was weird. But mom understood it—and to my annoyance, accepted the woman’s notice. I was warned not to talk to the Wilder children. \n\nAnd if I did, that was an automatic week grounding. Which meant no diner, no seeing friends after school, and my phone privileges taken away. According to her, she figured they were just a private family and wanted to accept that. She theorised the kids had been bullied at public school and had to be home-schooled. But I was sceptical. “All of them?” I’d asked her through a mouthful of cereal.\n\n“Phoebe.” Mom sent me a warning look, sipping her coffee. “What we’re going to do is respect Mrs Wilder’s wishes.”\n\n“It’s child abuse.” I muttered into my frosted flakes. Only for mom to reach across the table and poke me with the prongs of her fork.\n\n “Ow!”\n\n“Don’t play with your food.”\n\n“I’m not playing with my food.” I held up a spoonful of soggy cereal. “You just never get the chocolate brand. These taste like sandpaper.”\n\n“We are going to be respectable neighbors,” mom said, ignoring me. “So, you are not going to speak to those kids. Do you understand?”\n\nI knew mom only wanted to abide by the weird rules because she was obsessed with joining the mom’s club, or whatever they were called, but it didn’t make sense to me that his woman wasn’t letting her own kids have a social life. \n\nAt a younger age, maybe eleven or twelve, I could understand. But seventeen? That was almost college age. What, was she expecting to coddle them forever? \n\nDid she really think these kids were going to stay with her? Seventeen was the age of finding first loves and making mistakes. Not staying at home with mommy dearest. “Okay, but would you do this to me?” I asked her. “Would you really lock me up and stop me from going outside and living my life?”\n\nMom had been spreading butter on bread. I didn’t realise her mood had drastically changed until she was almost slicing her finger with the knife. “You don’t know this yet because you are far too young,” she lifted her head, her lips curving into a smile. “But there is something called a mother’s instinct. When our children are born, we are overcome with an almost… feral need to protect them from danger. If you look it up, it is present is every creature. Every mother. Our children are worth more than ourselves. We give our own lives to keep them alive. You can roll your eyes and say it’s stupid, but I’m sure as soon as you have your own child, you will feel the exact same with them.”\n\nShe nodded at me. “I had that with you. I… I still have it with you, Phoebe. No matter how old you are. When you were a baby, I wanted to hold you in my arms every second of every day. I hated it when people wanted to hold you, and you were such a clingy baby. Always cradled to my chest. As you grew up, I started to understand that you were seeing the world for the first time and you needed your own time and space. I let you take your first steps on your own. I cried when you said your first word—and when I grabbed your hand and raced down the kindergarten steps for the first time. Letting you go was painful.  And if I had a choice in the matter? Yes, I would keep you in here. I would stop you from going outside and seeing this world.” She dropped the knife with a startling, metallic clang, before picking it back up.\n\n“Because this planet is a scary place, Phoebe. And as mother’s, it is our job to keep our kids safe. Even if that means going to the slightest of extremes.”\n\n“Slightest of extremes?” I scoffed, despite knowing I was being pedantic. “They have to fly the nest! That’s called growing up!”\n\nIgnoring her glare, I continued. \n\n“Yes, I believe in mother’s instinct. But at what point do you have to look at yourself and realise you’re being ridiculous? Seventeen year olds aren’t infants. They won’t just blindly walk into traffic. They have self-awareness of what is wrong and right.”\n\nI pointed at myself. “You let me drive, right? I got my license. Where was your ‘mother instinct’ when I got myself a big-girl vehicle I could easily have an accident in?”\n\nMom curled her lip. “Don’t push it.”\n\nLeaning across the table, I fixed her with a smile. “See? You trust  me, mom. You let me grow up. That’s the difference between you and Mrs Wilder. Kids have to grow up. No matter what the circumstances are. It’s just part of being human. We all grow up and leave our parents.”\n\nI sent her a look, stirring the soggy soup of my cereal. “Well. Unless you’re Mrs Wilder.”\n\nMom finished her coffee and stood up. “You don’t even know these children. They could be in any stage of development which makes them very different to you. All kids mentally age at different points.” \n\nShe took her plate to the faucet and dumped it in the bowl. Mom washed the dishes when she was angry or stressed, and she was really going to town on our brand new pattern plates. I saw that as a mark of finality. “I’m done talking about this, okay? You’re not eighteen yet which means you abide by my rules, and really, Phoebe, I’m not exactly holding you prisoner. I’m just asking you to be polite and follow a simple rule which is not hard. We are a new family, and we need to make a good impression. Which means no talking to Mrs Wilder’s children.” She cleared her throat. \n\n“Respect our neighbour’s wishes or lose your phone.”\n\nDucking my head, I continued to stir my cereal into a mushy soup which had quickly become unappetising. It looked like barf. I pushed it away. “You only want me to follow the rules so you can get into Mrs Becker’s book club and go on Pilate dates with middle aged Karen’s.”\n\nMom dropped a plate in the sink, and the sound of the splash made me flinch slightly.\n\n“Is that understood?”\n\n“Yes.” I said, rolling my eyes. “Obviously, I will abide by this street’s draconian rules so I can continue scrolling through Tik-Tok.”\n\nIt was sarcasm, but I wasn’t sure my mother could detect it. She was so blinded by becoming one with our neighbors.\n\nWhy was she so obsessed with meeting all the other mom’s anyway?\n\nWas she planning on setting me up on a playdate with 3 year old Evie? I wouldn’t put it past her doing that for the brownie points.\n\n“Good. End of conversation.” Mom said, hurrying to get her jacket and bag. “I’m late for work, and you have an induction to get to.”\n\nI wanted to argue further because this sounded unfair. The kids were teenagers, right? How were they not arguing against this?  It seemed insane that they were going along with what their mother said. But I was aware of significant punishment if I broke this rule. So, I begrudgingly agreed. After my induction, I asked around new friends and classmates if anybody knew of the Wilder kids, and they did. \n\nBut they didn’t want to elaborate on what they knew. I heard a lot of rumours with dead ends. Most of them involved a father who had walked out on them, and their mother going into ultra-protective mode in response. It sounded like these kids were bearing the brunt of a messy divorce. They were complete enigma’s.\n\nI didn’t know anything about them except from their insanely overprotective mother’s wicked grip on them. I gave up being curious. Mom was serious about me not speaking not them. She gave me a lecture on respecting the woman’s privacy, and blah, blah, blah. I tuned out after five minutes, my attention flicking to an episode of Breaking Bad playing on the lounge TV.\n\nThe next few weeks were boring. Mom was invited to join Mrs Beck’s book club, so on Monday’s at 5PM, I made myself scarce. I did exactly what mom said. I ignored the kids next door. My bedroom happened to be facing the room of one of the kids, but their dark blue curtains were always shut. Sometimes it was hard. When I was sitting in the yard, reading a book, I could hear them on the other side of the fence.\n\nThe boys were the most vocal, laughing and teasing each other. There was a point when I risked it. I jumped to my feet and got halfway across the expanse of grass, standing on the tips of my toes and trying to catch a peek. But mom was calling me inside. I swore she had eyes in the back of my head. Mom always knew when I was outside. When I was near the fence. \n\nIt wasn’t until a month had gone by when I finally got a glimpse of a Wilder kid. I had just gotten back from school. I’d dumped my backpack on my bed and grabbed my phone, slumping onto my bed to text my friends and mindlessly scroll through social media. I noticed movement at the corner of my eye, and when I’d lifted my head, blinking rapidly—those same blue curtains which had shut me out for what felt so long—they were open. Not just that.\n\nI could see a bedroom smothered in personality. I glimpsed a hardwood desk strewn with paper and an expensive laptop, a blue bedspread,  a beaten up guitar leaning against light green walls covered in old-school movie posters. \n\nThere were screwed up pieces of paper everywhere. I had to guess he was some kind of artist. The room was illuminated in the evening dim, a soft warm light bringing the room to life. A knock startled me, and my gaze flicked to the window. \n\nThere he was. The Wilder boy next door. \n\nHe was my age, maybe even older. This guy looked almost college aged. Which made it increasingly weirder that his mother would insist on babying him at the age of seventeen.\n\n He was cute. The dorky kind of cute. He wore bulky glasses but was the type to instantly suit pretty much anything. If I could compare him to anyone, it would be the mental image in my head that my younger self had imagined Percy Jackson when I reads the books. \n\nThe guy looked comfortable in a sweater and jeans, mousey brown hair hanging in warm eyes. There was an inquisitive smile on his lips. I jumped up to open my window to speak to him, but he shook his head—and I quickly remembered his mother’s stupid rule which forbid us from talking. So, I got creative.\n\nGive me a moment! I mouthed.\n\nI expected him to ignore me and go back to what he was doing, but the guy straightened up and nodded, arching a brow.\n\nHe was intrigued.\n\nI grabbed an old notebook and a pen and sat on my bed, scribbling a message. I wrote: “Hello! So, you’re the kid under house arrest lmao.”\n\nWhen I held it up, his smile pricked. He laughed. I couldn’t hear it, it was nice to see. I could tell he had a dorky kind of laugh. The guy held up a hand for me to wait and rummaged on his desk. He quickly wrote out a message and held it up with a grin. He looked almost proud of his own message, and I couldn’t resist my own smile. I expected him to curse his mother, maybe apologise for the lack of communication.\n\nBut instead, he simply wrote: “Hello! What’s your name?” Followed by a slightly smudged smiley.\n\nAfter a moment of consideration, mom’s words echoing in my mind, I thought fuck it. “Phoebe.” I said. “Yours?”\n\n“It’s nice to meet you, Phoebe.” He responded. Which spanned multiple conversations which took up several of my notepads.\n\nWe talked about everything from school to his life at home. He had three siblings. Matilda, Freddie, and Issac. He liked to play the guitar and draw, but also apparently sucked at both. When I asked what his favourite TV show was, he looked confused for a moment before answering “All of them”. Following that odd answer, I asked if he liked Marvel, and again, he had that look again. A look of confusion. \n\nBut I knew he was trying to make a good impression. “What is Marvel?” He wrote back, this time his handwriting in a bubbly font. I could almost call his writing calligraphy. It practically danced off of the page. The Wilder boy’s strange answers made wonder if this kid had been home-schooled his whole life. He seemed way too polite. Kids were polite, sure. \n\nThere was a certain amount of respect you had to pay to your elders and parents.\n\nBut looking at this kid, I wasn’t even sure he knew what a meme was—or even the concept of a joke. He had no idea about one of the biggest movie franchise in the world, and his favourite celebrity was apparently “All of them”.  In fact, he had answered “All of them” to several of my questions.  His messages reminded me of my grandma’s. Still though, he was good company. Though I made it my mission to convert him into a normal teenager.\n\nI had to guess due to constantly being home and around the same people, this kid had zero social skills. I asked him what his favourite movie was, out of the posters on the wall. He had Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, and Fight Club.\n\nAgain, he looked confused. His head cocked to the side, and I had to physically point to them behind him.\n\n“All of them.” He wrote back with a smiley face.\n\nDamn, this kid needed to see a movie which wasn’t some educational shit. I bet his mother had turned him into perfect member of society.\n\n“What have you seen?” I couldn’t help asking him. “Like, movies, TV shows. Do you play video games?”\n\nHe shook his head before scribbling back. “What is that?”\n\nHoly shit, this kid was completely cut off from the outside world.\n\nI was already mentally thinking up plans to get him out of the house and to a party, or something like that. From the look of this kids face—a slightly blank if not completely innocent smile—he needed time away from home. Away from his overprotective mother’s wicked grasp.\n\nAfter a while, I realised he never told me his name. I didn’t notice time go by. Almost three hours, and I’d spent most of it lecturing him on movies and TV shows he really should have known. I guessed Mrs Wilder didn’t let him watch the TV.  My gaze flicked to his laptop. And I wouldn’t have been surprised if she had blocked out all social media. My notepad was full of scribbles and doodles, an attempt at copying his handwriting style. The sky was blooming into twilight outside, thick orange and cotton candy pink streaking the horizon. I have always loved a pre-twilight sky. \n\n“What’s your name?” I wrote in marker pen, before holding up my notepad. I was running out of paper. I could hear mom downstairs preparing dinner, and I could tell from his diminishing smile Mrs Wilder was probably shouting for him to go downstairs.\n\nHe didn’t reply for a while. I watched him put the pad down, before heading over to his desk and cleaning up the paper—every trace we had been talking and dumping each response he’d given in the trash. Before he slumped onto his bed, wrote something down in several strokes, before holding it up for me to see. “Casper.” He’d written. “My name is Casper Wilder.” \n\nFor a moment, his expression changed completely. He glanced at the door, before frowning at the pad of paper in his lap.\n\nIt looked like he wanted to write more, before twisting around, his eyes widening. Someone was coming. I could tell by the look on his face.\n\nThe knot between his brows. \n\nCasper gathered everything he’d been using to write to me, pens and pencils, scraps of paper and the backs of movie posters, and shoving them under his bed. Then he grabbed the curtains and pulled them closed, blocking me out once again. I thought he’d come back, but after standing like an idiot with an odd feeling in my gut, frowning at his curtains, I realised he was finished talking to me for the night. What I expected was that to be it. I didn’t think he’d come back. The next morning, however, he was back at his window, smiling at me through a mouthful of toothpaste. He was still in his pyjamas, unbrushed curls falling in sleepy eyes. \n\nHe looked strange without his glasses. Like his face was too bare. The more I took him in, though. Something was… different. Though I couldn’t make it out. It hit me then. \n\nCasper wasn’t moving, staying in the same position. The night before, he had gone to and from his bed, hurrying around to grab equipment to write with. But now he was stood, looking more shadow than human. I was quick to dive for my notepad, but Casper was already holding up his own greeting with a grin. “Good morning, Phoebe! How are you feeling today?”\n\n“Tired.” I wrote back, my writing barely comprehensible. “Do you have school?”\n\n“YES.” He responded with an excited smile. “I’m so excited to learn! Do you have a favourite class?”\n\nI laughed at that. And after looking confused, he copied my laugh. Which made me laugh harder.\n\n“None of them!” I scribbled back. “School is boring!”\n\nCasper shrugged. “I like it. I have a great tutor.”\n\n“Really?” This time, I drew an attempt at the rolling eyes emoji. “You shouldn’t be excited for school. Weirdo.”\n\nHe curled his lip. “You’re the weirdo.” He wrote back. Casper paused, chewing on the lid of the pen, before writing, “What’s a weirdo?”\n\n“You’re kidding!” This time, with too much vigour, I pointed to him with a laugh. “You! You’re the weirdo!”\n\nWe talked as I got ready for school, gathering all my books and homework. I was stuffing my gym clothes in my bag, when I noticed something was on the ground behind Casper. Looking closer, it looked like a chord. Like a long cable sort of thing. I thought it was for a games console, but then I remembered he had no idea what a video game was. I didn’t question what it was for a while. We talked every night, about everything and nothing. \n\nI told Casper about school and friends, filling up every piece of paper we had in the house, and he told me about his siblings. They were all the same age, and all enjoyed school. His brother was a piano prodigy, while his sister’s strongest subjects were math. Casper told me he felt like the odd one out being the artist of the family, and I quickly told him that creativity was the best part of a person.\n\nHe showed me his drawings. And to my confusion, and slight disgust, they were all of his mother. They were good—sure. His skills were Ivy League worthy. Perfect shading. Everything about the drawings were perfect.\n\nBut the fact that his muse was his mother—it put a weird taste in my mouth. He showed me each drawing, his smile widening with excitement. While I nodded and pretended to be impressed. Well, I was.\n\nThough it became startlingly obvious that Casper didn’t have a choice who he drew. He didn’t draw fruit or landscapes, or even the sky. We live in a picturesque town, the perfect canvas for an artist. However, Mrs Wilder was at the centre of every single fucking drawing and painting, ink blot. Even with different styles and angles, she was always there. And Casper Wilder saw no wrong in it. He saw absolutely no fucking wrong in this woman taking control of every aspect of his life. His social life, his friends, education and hobbies.\n\nI half expected him to grab his guitar and start singing about her through the glass. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was driving me crazy. We continued to talk through writing to each other, but soon enough the only subject was his mother. Casper asked me if I could rate a drawing he was working on. It was her. Of course it was. I ignored him, getting to my feet and holding up the sign I had written weeks before. But I was too scared to show him.\n\nI didn’t want to ruin our friendship, but I had to know. I had to know several things which had been keeping me up all night\n\n“Why are you okay with your mother controlling your life?” I asked in bold letters.\n\nAnd below that: “Also… I’ve been wondering this for a while. But what is that thing behind you?”\n\nThe thing behind him was at the centre of my thoughts. I’d worked out it wasn’t a chord for a TV or a games console. Not even a laptop, or for his guitar. Not to mention it was always there. Morning and evening, even at night when I spied him getting ready for bed. This thing was always on the floor, snaked across his bed. Sometimes it was even wrapped up on his desk. I couldn’t understand the length of it. I asked friends at school, and even the internet. But my descriptions didn’t do it justice. A long, silver chord like thing which didn’t have an end.\n\nCasper blinked at my message. Before he ducked his head and started writing before holding up his response.\n\n“I love my mom.” He said, doodling a little heart. “She doesn’t control my life. I like that she’s in it.”\n\nBelow that, a follow up message which twisted my gut. “What do you mean? I don’t see anything, Phoebe.”\n\nTapping my pad with my pen, I struggled to think of a response. There was no way he couldn’t see this thing. It was pretty hard to miss. Instead of writing, I pointed behind him.\n\n“That!” I mouthed, using my lips for the first time. It felt good to actually talk to him. Even if a window of glass separated us.\n\n“What?” His handwriting was slipping slightly. And I noticed his hands were visibly shaking. “What can you see, Phoebe?”\n\nThis time, he stood up. I noticed something change in him, the notepad slipping off his knee. Casper turned around, scanning the room.\n\nBefore his eyes finally found the cord-thing. His smile seemed to dampen, eyes going wide, fists clenching.\n\n“Casper?” I hurriedly wrote when he didn’t move for a while. His gaze was glued to the chord. I watched his eye follow it around the room, before his hand slowly raised, trembling fingers moving to his neck, and then the back of his head. Was there an insect? That’s what I thought. It must have been a spider, or some kind of bug which had startled him. I could only describe his expression as close to catatonic. He stood up, but then quickly slumped back down. But not like it was his choice. As if he was being dragged back down by an unseen force. Like one minute I was looking at Casper Wilder, and then I was seeing a stranger. A completely different person take over a rapidly paling face. Something snapped inside my gut when he moved forwards suddenly, his arms lunging out to close the curtains. \n\nBut that wasn’t the end of what I saw. The boy had unknowingly left a splinter, a tiny gap allowing me to glimpse. I expected him to react to whatever had freaked him out. But instead, he simply flopped back onto his bed. This time, I noticed the silver chord jolt with his movement. He was already asleep, his eyes closed. I watched him, my heart diving into my throat. There was no way he just fall asleep like that. It was too fast.\n\nMrs Wilder came into his room soon after. But I only got a glimpse of her because she was already striding over to the window. I ducked behind my bed, panic creeping up my spine. I expected the woman to start yelling at me through the window, but instead she simply pulled the curtains properly shut. Mrs Wilder definitely saw me. And even if she didn’t, Casper’s messages to me were still piled on his bedsheets. I was left completely in the dark, then. I stood and pressed my face against the window, fully aware that I was addicted to the mystery surrounding my neighbour.  \n\nMy mind began to wonder to uncertain and scary places. \n\nWhat exactly was Casper’s mother doing to him behind the curtain? I wanted to believe she was simply tucking him in and saying goodnight, but the strange chord-like thing on the ground, and how he’d reacted to noticing it—for what seemed like the first time. His change in expression, like a different person had taken over him, and that person was… scared.\n\nCatatonic. I refused to believe Mrs Wilder was innocent. I waited for him to draw his curtains again—but he didn’t. Casper’s window stayed completely blocked for days. I stopped hearing his siblings in the yard, and after days of nothing, mom reiterated her warning to me over dinner. “No communication with the Wilder children,” she told me. “Which includes notes and letters.”\n\nBusted.\n\nSo, Mrs Wilder knew we were talking.\n\nI wondered if she was punishing her son for breaking the rules—and that was why he had been MIA for the last few days.\n\n“There’s something wrong with Casper.” I worked up the courage to tell mom  “The boy next door. I think Mrs Wilder is hurting him.”\n\n“Hurting him?”\n\n“Yeah, like…” I frowned. “I think she can make him go to sleep when she wants.” I pulled a face. “Like, hypnotism—or maybe even drugs.”\n\n“Mmm hmm.”\n\n“Drugs, mom.” I said. “Mrs Wilder is drugging her seventeen year old son!”\n\n“That’s nice, honey.”\n\n“Are you even listening to me?” I leaned across the table, stabbing the page of her book. “Mom! Casper Wilder is a total blank slate!”\n\n“I’ve told you a thousand times. She’s protecting them,” she hummed. “You have just seen far too many crime dramas—and your generation have been poisoned by the likes of crime entrainment. Finding what you think is your own mystery must be fun, but you are reaching, baby.”\n\n“Reaching?” I prodded my own temple. “I’m sorry, were you not listening when I told you he doesn’t even know what video games are?”\n\nMom was acting weird. Usually, she talked about school with me, and at least tried to engage in conversation, but she was too busy reading the book Mrs Becker has recommended her. It was like talking to a brick.\n\n“You’re being ridiculous, Phoebe,” she turned over a page with a sigh. “I’ve spoken to his mother. She’s a lovely woman. We’re having lunch next week. I met her in the grocery store.\"\n\n“What a coincidence,” I shot her a look over my phone. I was looking up child abuse helplines. “You’re suddenly best friends with the neighborhood witch when I’m caught talking to her son.” Dropping my phone for emphasis, I stood up. “If you would just listen to me—\"\n\n“That’s enough.” Mom cut me off.  She finished her coffee, grabbing her jacket from where it was slung over a chair. “Stay out of trouble, okay? I’m heading back to work. I’ve left cash if you want to order pizza. You have other interests, alright? Please. Leave Mrs Wilder alone. This obsession you have with her kids is unhealthy. Why don't you stick to fiction, hm?\"\n\nYeah, no.\n\nAs soon as she was gone, I sprinted to my room to see if Casper’s curtains were open. To my dismay, though. They weren’t.\n\nFrustrated, I yanked mine shut too.\n\nSlumping onto my bed, I continued looking up helplines. I got bored soon after and started googling chords and wires which fit the description of what I’d seen. \n\nThere was a match, though it was on a weird medical website which looked like it had been made in 2005. The interface was outdated, and according to the description, it was some kind of clamping device. There were a lot of words I didn’t know, and after further googling, I was getting increasingly more confused. Until my gaze flicked to a section at the bottom of the page. According to whoever wrote it, the chord in question was experimental. There weren’t many in circulation, but it was mainly used in medical centres such as specialist surgeries and hospitals. When I scrolled down, there was a diagram which showed a long chord-like thing labelled as “The body” and a sharp looking needle. Something warm crept up my throat and I sat up, frowning at the screen. Was that it? Was that thing the end?\n\nAnd what did this thing even connect to?\n\nA sudden THUD made me almost jump out of my skin. I slid off my bed.\n\nTHUD.\n\nIt was coming from my window. My curtains were still shut, blowing in the slight breeze. Slowly, I made my way over, my spine tingling.\n\nTHUD.\n\nTHUD.\n\nTHUD.\n\nThe first thing I saw was red. Bright, intense scarlet spattering the Wilder boy's window. Then I glimpsed Casper. He was slamming his face into the glass, over and over again, his already bleeding nose exploding with more red. But it wasn't the boy I knew. The kid I had gotten to know over the last few months. No. This kid was a mess of torn up clothes, bruises yellowing his eyes and scratches sliced into his flesh. My first thought was his mom. She must have done this to him. But then my gaze was finding his bloodied nails, and claw marks on his arms and cheeks. There was something white wrapped around his head, a bandage.\n\nI could glimpse red leaking through, smudging clinical white and pooling down his temples in sharp rivulets. Casper's eyes were an enigma in themselves, a mixture of fear and confusion, and almost feral look of anger and frustration. But the twitch in his lip and between his brow, was evident that something was fighting that. \n\nEmotions and feelings he wasn't feeling himself. \n\nIt was like looking at two different guys. One was Casper, the artist who lived next door, who ended every message with a smiley. While this twisted other self, a self which was broken out and was feral in his expression, was a whole other person. I started to realise the more I looked at him, at the mess of flesh and blood caught between his nails, and his trembling hands every so often creeping to the back of his skull before jolting and coming back to curl into fists, battering the window--- he had clawed into his own head.\n\nImmediately, I reached for my phone. But he already knew what I was going to do.\n\n“No!” He mouthed, shaking his head—so I grabbed my notepad. I could barely write.\n\n“What’s going on?” I held up my pad. “Are you okay? You’re fucking bleeding!”\n\nInstead of using a pen and paper, Casper squinted, blinking rapidly. His handwriting was different, a manic scrawl, as he wrote in the explosion of blood on the window. \n\nWhen he twisted around, his gaze going to the door, the breath caught in my throat. Someone was yelling his name. I could tell by his reaction. His bloodied fingers clawed at his face and hair, at bald patches and rugged stitches lining his scalp and the back of his skull. They kept going, a narrow line of stitches all the way down his neck, and presumably his spine. \n\nMy thoughts flashed back to the equipment I’d been looking up. This kind of thing was designed to bury into the brain and spinal cord. I looked for it, but the thing was nowhere to be seen on him. It was no longer on the floor. Casper struggled to write coherently. I notice he kept swearing, his finger smudging the words he was trying to write. This was more like it, I thought. This was the kind of boy I had expected to be the kid next door. “Fuck.” He shook his head, his movements erratic as one hand went to the back of his head and came back slick with glistening red.\n\nFuck.\n\nFuck.\n\nFuck!\n\nHe slammed his fists into the window in frustration, but I was already seeing his message start to blossom and make sense.\n\n“WHO.”\n\nCasper was crying. I could see that he could barely breathe, struggling to inhale, swiping at his eyes with smudged fists.\n\n“AM.”\n\n“I?”\n\nI started to back away, but he continued. When he’d finished, he wrote it again and again, growing more and more fraught.\n\nI jumped when he slammed his head into the glass of the window again. At first a part of me thought he was using his blood for paint.\n\nSo he was intentionally hurting himself to draw more.\n\nBut his words spelled it out for me in black and white.\n\nWho am I? He wrote. WHO AM I? WHO AM I WHO AM I? WHO AM I? \n\nThis time I could barely even read my own handwriting. I held up a scrap of paper.\n\n“DID YOUR MOM HURT YOU?”\n\nI gestured to the bandage on his head, and he stumbled back, wild eyes searching for something to write with.\n\n“THAT WOMAN.” He scribbled in block capitals.\n\n“THAT WOMAN IS NOT MY FUCKING MOM.” He wrote, before he dropped to his knees. He was still writing but failing to show me.\n\nI don’t know who I am.\n\nHe wrote the same thing 12 times, before tearing up the paper and burying his head in his lap.\n\nI gave up writing messages.\n\n“Casper!” I shouted.\n\nThen I threw a rock at his window, and he lifted his head, blinking rapidly.\n\nGesturing for him to open up his window, he struggled with the latch for a moment before pulling it open.\n\nI stuck my head out of my own window, cold air hitting me in the face. “I’m going to help you.” I managed to choke out. “Hold on, okay?”\n\nCasper clawed at his face. \"Help me.\" His voice was a sharp hiss. \"Please help me. i don't know who I...\" His fingernails ripped into the flesh of his cheeks, but he barely seemed to feel it, to be fazed. They kept going, digging into layer after layer. \"I don't know who I am.\" He jumped up suddenly trashing his desk and throwing his laptop against the wall. He reminded me of a child having a tantrum. In this case though, it was more than acting out. I was sure that Casper Wilder didn’t exist.  \"I don't know who I am. I don't know... fuck... I don't know who I am!”\n\nHis eyes found mine, and I could have sworn I saw something there, buried deep, deep inside his pupil.\n\nHe blinked, and it was gone. \n\n“You need to tell me what she’s done to you.” I said stiffly. “Tell me what she’s done to your head.”\n\nCasper was only growing progressively more frenzied. Animalistic. He came back to the window, slamming his fists into it. Then his head. Again and again. Like he was trying to knock himself out. \"Help me. I can't remember... I can't remember who I am. I just know.. I know her.”\n\nHis lips suddenly twisted into a startling grin.\n\n“Mom.” He whispered, his expression softening. “My mom.” His gaze flicked to the desk. “She won’t like that I’ve… I’ve made a mess.”\n\n“Your mom did this.” I gritted out. “I’m calling the cops.”\n\nHis expression  was scaring me. Whatever was in his eye was scaring me. But this boy needed help. He needed to be taken out of that house.\n\n\"No.\" Casper sobered up. \"No, my mom... my mommy said... she said no police.\" His eyes widened suddenly, seemingly noticing the mess of the window for the first time. “Oh, no.” Casper stumbled back. “I should… I should clean this. Before my mom sees what a mess I made.”\n\nHis door opened, and another head poked through.\n\nAnother guy. I figured it was one of his brothers. Freddie, or Issac. He too had a bandage wrapped around his head.\n\nHis brother’s eyes found the blood spatters, and then me. Like his mother, he strode over to the window, shutting the curtains.\n\nBut I could still hear it.\n\nA mechanical whirring noise, followed by Casper’s sharp breath and the sickly crunch of metal protruding through blood and bone.\n\nThat was it.\n\n“Mom!” I yelled. I’d heard her come back earlier. She must have finished work early.\n\nI stumbled downstairs to tell her to call the cops, but a shadow was already looming behind the corner. Before I knew what was happening, a wet rag stinking of pool cleaner was being pressed over my mouth and nose. \n\nI don’t remember passing out. When I woke up, I was lying on my mom’s couch. It was dark outside, but the curtains were open. My foggy thoughts drunk in slithers of moon poking from between the clouds before registering I wasn’t alone. Sitting up, my stomach galloped. There was no sign of mom. But I recognised each of the faces surrounding me. Mrs Beck was sitting with her legs crossed, delicately sipping from a cup. And next to her, wearing a smug smile, was Mrs Wilder. She wasn’t looking at me. \n\nInstead, her eyes were lovingly glued to something which had been built over mom’s coffee table. It was made completely out of paper. The scraps of paper I had been using to talk to her son. Though there weren’t just my messages. I glimpsed Casper’s writing too. It was a house. I was staring at a perfect paper rendition of the Wilder house. And next to it stood four little paper dolls.\n\nThere were no faces. No expressions. Just four dolls. Two boys, and two girls.\n\nThough in her lap were more. Mrs Wilder’s nimble fingers were working to make more of them. They filled her lap differing in sizes.\n\n“Phoebe, is it?”\n\nHer voice was smooth like chocolate. I could almost make it for kind.\n\nI nodded, my heart in my throat. I was watching her create another doll. She folded a piece of paper in half, cut it in two, and started to fold sections, bringing the doll-form to life. This one, unlike the other, did have attention put into it. She had even added the birth mark on my right temple, following that, colouring in my dark blonde hair, and finishing with my jean jacket. Mrs Wilder didn’t have to spell it out for me. When she got to the doll’s head, she shocked me, by tearing it off. Then she ripped off its arms and legs and tearing its torso in half.\n\nMrs Wilder straightened up. “Phoebe, are you aware of a mother’s instinct?”\n\nI couldn’t reply. Instead, I was staring at the paper-doll she had set alight. I watched smouldering orange rip into it, before she put the fire out, dropping the blackened paper doll on the carpet. For just a brief second, I could have sworn the hem of my jacket had also caught alight. Just a single flash of orange. But maybe I was seeing things. “I was pregnant with four beautiful children,” she said softly. “As soon as I found out, I had already named them.” Her smile was dreamy. Melancholic. “Freddie. My little Freddie. He kicked quite a lot. Oh, and Matilda. She and her twin were quite the pair, I must say. Swiftly draining me of my energy so I had to take medication.” Mrs Wilder chuckled. \n\n“And finally, Casper. Named after my favourite movie. I loved him with all of my heart. He was my little fighter.” She quickly lost her smile, her gaze flicking to me. “I hope you understand that if you talk to, or even the breathe the same air as my children again, I will rip you apart too.”\n\nMrs Wilder never raised her voice. She didn’t need to. I was terrified of her.\n\nShe held up my doll for emphasis, before throwing it in the paper dollhouse. “Or… perhaps you could become another daughter of mine, hmm?” I couldn’t move, my body paralysed when she leaned over me, cruel eyes drinking me in. “Maybe not.” She hummed. “I only take the dead or dying.” Straightening up, she sighed. “It’s not a hard task, Phoebe. Keep away from my children and I will keep away from you.”\n\nThe two of them left after that, leaving me unable to move. To breathe. They took the dollhouse. All of the paper. Even my own doll.\n\nCasper has been unreachable since. Mom has hardly been at home—and I’m starting to lose my mind.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t know who or what Mrs Wilder is, but I’m afraid she’s going to keep adding to her collection.\n\nWhoever those kids are, they’re not hers. I think she’s taken them. She’s using them as canvases. Dolls. For what she’s lost.\n\nAm I next?",

        "text": "Since I was a child, space and the endless possibilities for extraterrestrial life have fascinated me. The Golden Record, which is essentially a crash course in all things humanity, sent on the Voyager probes has always been a specific interest of mine. The idea of sharing the essence of humanity and the human condition with the universe- even if the overwhelming likelihood is that no intelligent species would ever come across it- captured my spirit as a child and still somewhat does. As tends to happen with the majority of people, life on Earth and the people on it took more of a focus than curiosity during my teens and early twenties and so I settled down in a comfortable tech-related office job. I never quite enjoyed the mind-numbing boredom that sitting in a cubicle gave me, but it paid the bills and was relatively stress-free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA childhood friend of mine sent me a text containing a link to a job posting at the Kennedy Space Center. It had great pay, and benefits scratched the itch of my affinity for space-related topics and was open to individuals with no prior space industry experience. I knew that I would regret not applying and had nothing to lose by doing so, so I submitted my application three days later. The application process was a long and tiring one- as is the case for almost all large organizations these days- but a Gmail notification on the Monday morning following the final interview and stage of the process detailed their offer of employment. I was ecstatic before I had even finished reading the opening sentence of \"*Congratulations! I would like to extend this offer of employment to-*\" I sent a celebratory text to my best friend, as well as the friend who had shared the opportunity with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first day was the Monday two weeks after the offer letter was sent. The Uber driving me from the temporary accommodation of a nearby hotel to the Center drove past a sign that finally made it feel real, the NASA logo along with the words \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Kennedy Space Center\". I was filled with child-like wonder and a giddy excitement I hadn't felt in many years yet I forced myself to maintain a steely look of professionalism and tranquility. The usual first-day-at-a-new-job routine ensued, and over the next few months, I settled into my new role as a Space Debris and Re-entry Technician which I came to thoroughly enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was Monday, September 5 2022 when the incident occurred. As usual, I received a report of a piece of debris re-entering the atmosphere towards our general area of the Southern United States. Typical procedure dictated that I check the data (size, weight, shape, etc.) and either agree or disagree with the already provided categorization of the specific piece of debris posing a high, medium, or low risk. I agreed that this piece of debris should be categorized as high risk, as its size and weight combined with the extreme speed gained throughout the process of re-entry may prove a threat to life. These objects tend to land in some form of water- considering the majority of the planet is covered by water- and so are typically harmless but as time went on and it hurtled closer this one seemed to be primed to land in the general area of the Space Center. I was somewhat nervously excited, seeing as the odds of any form of space debris landing near us were astronomical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt landed shortly after I received the initial alert, and as always a team was sent to inspect and retrieve the debris. After reports of debris being stolen and sold by fortunate people who stumbled onto the site, we were trialing new technology which involved cameras mounted on the Inspection Teams' bodies and these images being live-streamed to us back at the Space Center. The team approached the debris and the buzzing conversations in the large room died down to listen to any communication. Almost everybody in the room realized before any words were even spoken that this was no typical debris. A large, white High-Gain Antenna was planted into the soil and a half-broken Magneotometer jutted out from the side of the main body. This was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the Voyager 1 Probe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVoyager 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral-just a few miles from the crash site- on September 5 1977 and was the first human-made object to enter interstellar space. I had come across a live tracker for its position in the universe a few years ago, and so my first action was to navigate to that site with my trembling hands. It took an age to type in the URL and to gather enough focus from my wildly racing mind to read what was before me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaunch Date: Mon, 05 Sept 1997 12:56:00 UTC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMission Elapsed Time: 45 years, 0 months, 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDistance from Earth: 0 mi, 0 AU\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart sank. I looked over at the Voyager 2 data to ensure I wasn't losing my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaunch Date: Sat, 20 Aug 1977 14:29:00 UTC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMission Elapsed Time: 45 years, 0 months, 2 weeks, 2 days, 22 hours, 31 minutes, 0 seconds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDistance from Earth: 10,365,568,983 mi, 111.51071985398552 AU\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVoyager 2 was hurtling through space on its expected trajectory, Voyager 1 had found its way back to Earth. Someone, *something* had made it find its way back to Earth. Back to almost the exact location it began its journey through the stars. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhilst I had been confirming my eyes weren't deceiving me, the team had surrounded the returned probe and awaited the instruction of the decision-makers in the Space Center. My boss was the one to instruct them to inspect every visible surface of the probe, and they duly obliged. Almost bonded to the very fabric of the surface was The Golden Record sent along with the probe all those years ago that I had so enthusiastically researched throughout my youth. It seemed completely untouched in terms of its physical appearance despite its apparent re-positioning on the surface and decades of traveling through the expanse of space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe record was retrieved and captured the attention of all present, particularly myself, and the probe itself became an afterthought as the question of what exactly awaited us upon playing the record took center stage. The drawings carved into the record detailed exactly how it should be played and they were followed with careful intent. A dim static noise began to come from the small speakers on the record player. A news anchor talked about an interview given by a politician, a sports commentator an emotional victory, and a rock song played on the local radio station. These were all signals that had escaped the atmosphere between the time Voyager 1 was launched and the day it returned. Most of them should have been too weak for anybody to hear, to decipher, to reply to. But *something* did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA voice began to drown out the captured broadcasts. It spoke in a strange language consisting of no words, but sounds made using the tongue with varying levels of loudness. A translator delivered the meaning of these sounds in English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\"We warned you that they are always listening- to never make noise again.\"***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\"It is too late for us to help you.

        "text": "It was the night of my birthday many years ago when I heard it.  A crappy birthday.  Nothing of note happened.  No cake, no party, no celebration, little acknowledgement.  \n\nI heard someone screaming my name in my apartment in Japan. Asking for help. However, it wasn't just any name. It was the name family members called me between the ages of 4-12. A nickname.  Something only close relatives and family would call me.  Something I hadn't heard in years. This apartment was for a company and could house three people easily.   But I was only using a single room.\n\nI lived alone. So I investigated.\n\nI found no one. Confused, I thought I imagined it or dreamt it and went to bed.  But I wasn't asleep when I heard the plee for help.  The scream.\n\nMy cousin contacted me out of the blue a couple months earlier. He had run ins with the law and gangs.  He even did some time in jail or prison. But he needed my help. I tried my best to help him. To explain - to actually assist him in any way I could. But life just happens. He was my best friend from childhood but then - at that time he was practically a stranger. I stopped hearing from him. I thought he just hit a patch.\n\nThe morning after hearing the scream I received an email from my dad.\n\nMy cousin passed away from internal bleeding.\n\nHe drank himself to death.\n\nHe had no job or income but his mom would supply him with alcohol I was told.\n\nHe was living in southern California when he passed.  On the other side of the world.\n\nThe scream.\n\nA scream to me.  For me.\n\nUsing my name.  My family's nick name for me.\n\n#The scream.\n\n##Help\n\nI feel guilty for reasons I can't explain. But I know that perhaps it's my fault. In a real way. Because the pain that led him to drink I caused in part. Because some of those demons he tried to chase away came directly from me. Because people hurt him because they knew I loved him most of all. And some people have more power than any could truly comprehend.\n\nI just never imagined someone screaming for help across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThat much pain and desperation is something that haunts me to this day. It's been years.\n\nI wish I could explain.  Apologize.  Ask forgiveness.  But I think about his direct family.  I think how they would feel.  Would they even believe me?  And could I even explain what or who I could anger that would attack someone because I cared about them.\n\nIt would do far more harm than good.\n\nI've told a person or two.  People that felt guilty about not helping a friend or detecting they would commit suicide.\n\nBut it's just not the same.\n\nI can still hear that scream.  I can think about it in the day or night just creeping into my thoughts.\n\nTalk to me cousin.\n\nForgive me if you can.\n\nI love you.",

        "text": "I have a hobby that I enjoy, every once in a while I'll look at house listings, find a house I like the look of and imagine what it would be like to live there. There are photos and I imagine what sort of furniture and wallpaper I would have in each room, what I would plant in the garden, also there are usually maps attached so I can click on the map and navigate round the area, checking out what cafes and places of interest are nearby, what trains and buses run in the area as well.\n\nAbout six months ago I found a really gorgeous house in a small village - why are these villages always called something like Greenville or Roses-Under-Water? I clicked on the map to look around the area and found myself following the route of a meandering main street filled with coffee shops with floral displays in the middle of the street, it looked idyllic. Everything was much clearer than it usually is on these photos, I felt like I could actually wander into the stores and touch the produce. As there sometimes are in these scenes, the photographer had inadvertantly captured some people stuck forever in the pose they were in at the time, a man walking his dog, a child skipping along.\n\nAs I scrolled up to a woman pushing a pram, she suddenly turned and stared right out of the screen at me. I jumped and closed the page quickly.Out of curiosity I googled the bus number for that area, as noted on the map, there was no number 14 bus to be found at all.\n\nOver time I thought I must have imagined it all or dreamed it and went again to look at houses, and landed on the same page for the same house, I had to check if i had been mistaken before, and set off scrolling aloud the same street. The flowers were slightly browned and droopy, and I imagined i could feel a chilly breeze. I could see the store windows so clearly, here a butchers store with things hanging on hooks in the window which looked like human hands and feet.As I tried to bring it into clearer view, to see what it actually was, the same woman with the pram came into focus. The baby opened its mouth showing its sharp teeth and staring at me, and I nearly broke the mouse slamming it so hard to shut the page.\n\nThis experience stopped me from looking at the houses online and I found other hobbies to waste time with, one of them is riding around on buses to see different towns I have never visited.\n\nToday I became lost, but as often is the way in these small towns there is no phone signal, and about ten minutes ago I asked someone where the bus stop out of this town is, they pointed me to this stop, which they said was the only bus stop round here, I read the timetable and saw that it serves the number 14 bus, to Greenville, and nowhere else, and as I have no other options, I decided I would take the bus but get off the bus before that town and try to find my way.\n\nAs I have been standing here, I have noticed a woman walking towards the bus stop, pushing a pram.I recognise her. The baby is crying in that hungry manner that babies do.",

        "text": " \n\nTo start of here, my name is Alex\n\nI wanna share a little story/encounter i had.\n\nLittle back story here,\n\nMe and my girlfriend bought a small appartement for us an our daughter back in oktober 2021.\n\nBefore we could move in we had to do some renovations, as laying a new floor , painting the walls ect.... Once we were done we moved in around the mids of november. Its a small 2 bedroom apparment on the first floor of a big block . It's not big but it's cozy to give a little inside of how the apparments layout is you come in trough the front door in to a small hallway where as you stand in front of the front door to you back you see one door infront of you ( daughters room) 3 doors to your left one is the master bedroom , one for the toilet and one for the bathroom. then next to the front door there is a small window and next to it the door to the dining room/living room and kitchen. and on the left there hangs a mirror. So as most of you would now when you start renovating on a small window of time not everything is finished as so it was in our apparment. The door to go to the dining/living room wasn't done so we removed the door to get it ready for the paint job ect....\n\nWe always sleep with our bedroom door open for our daughter so we can hear her when she wakes up or when se has a bad dream or stuff it gives us a more safe feeling towards our daughter so.\n\nBut this means i sleep on the door side of the room and i can see in the hall way en the mirror that is in the hall way so one night i woke up around 2am and i saw that the light in the bathroom was still on ( i could see it in the mirror in the hallway) i look beside me and saw my girlfriend laying next to me so i tought maybye one of us forgot te turn of the light in the bathroom when we went to sleep. I tought nothing of it and got up and first went to the toilet and as i was sitting on the toilet with the door slighty open i looked in the mirror with a sleeping head and i tought i saw something move in the bathroom under crack of the door ( the door wasn't fully closed so i thought its probably one of our cats.\n\n As i got off the toilet and whent outside the door i looked again in the mirror and saw in the crack of the door a figure thats when my heart started raising and pounding faster, i shook my head and try to brush it of as if i'm sleep drunk you know. So i moved slowly to the bathroom door and when on to open the door at that moment i almost jump troug the sealing cause my two cats where now sitting next to me and staring at the door. I look down to them and petted them on the head but they didn't move (normaly if i do that they keep asking for more attention but they didn't the just stared blankly at the bathroom door) so thats when i paused for a second to look back in the mirror and thats when i saw in the crack a face, looking at me trough the mirror , i rubbed my eyes and turned my head towards the door and opened it with a fast and hard push and when i opened it i saw my self standing in the bathroom looking towards my mirror and sink in the bathroom.\n\n That's the moment i fully froze and had the feeling i couldn't move or speak or yell my heart racing in my chest. I tried to go away or close my eyes and hoping this was all a dream but i couldn't do anything. Then it turned to me and just told me,'' keep doing what your doing your doing the right thing for now.''\n\n When it finished saying these exact words to me i then could close my eyes and when i opend them again it was gone. So i turned the lights out as fast as i could closed the door took the cats en went back to my bed to get under the blankeds and try to fall a sleep as fast as i could i can only remember seeing at the alarm clock it was still 2am and then i woke up around 7am by the alarm to get up with my girlfriend to take our daughter to school. So i didn't told anything to my girlfriend about this encounter cause i tought i was just having a bad dream or something. Cause in the past i had been to a sleeping clinic cause i dream alot and always felt tired when i woke up even tough i have enough hours of sleep so. They blamed it cause i lay on my back ect.... But anyways back to the story so i woke up did my moring routine with my girlfriend and daughter and we set of the bring our little girl to school. In the car thats when i knew it wasn't a dream and it really happend was because of my girlfriend saying to me. Honey did you leave the lights on again in the bathroom? Cause i saw you getting up last night to go and put them out. I look at her with a pale face and just nodded and didn't tell anything to here cause i don't want her to think i'm getting crazy maybe. For the record i do not and did not take any medication nor did i drink alcohol of such. But yeah thats the first encounter i had.\n\n Now we fast forward a couple of weeks. So a few week later, i was up late cause i had the late shift ( working from 2pm until 10pm) so i came home around half past 10 and everyone was already a sleep cause my girlfriend had to wake up early to do the early shift at 5 am. I had my dinner as usual when that stood ready for me in the microwave and set behind my computer to play some video games and watch some youtube videos at around half past 12 i when to bed but first i would always go check on our daughter and give her a kiss and then i know everything is oke and i went to do my routine to go to bed. \n\nSo i got next to my girlfriend i cuddle her very gently and fell asleep almost instant. I was sleeping pretty good and around 4am i woke up and i was laying with my back to the door and i still had my arm around my girlfriend. I gave her a kiss on the back of her head en turned around , thats when i say (cause of the door thats always open of our bedroom) that there was light in the livingroom. I didn't think much of it so i stood up when to the toilet looked back at my girlfriend in bed trough the mirror in the hallway when i heard i sound coming from the kitchen. Then my heart started pounding again and the first incident witch at this point i was actually forgotten. But then it came back to me at that point and i knew instantly it was not one of my cats cause when i stood up to go to the toilet i saw them both lying on the foot of our bed so i took the first thing that i could get my hands on in the hallway ( witch was a broom) and when as silent as i can to the kitchen ready to attack this time. \n\nWhen i came around the table at the opening of the kitchen i was ready to swing it like a real champ and when i did i stopped immediately cause it was my girlfriend who was standing there fully dressed for work and shaking by me cause is was almost attacking here. Se looked scared at me and asked if everything was oke with me. I looked at here and immediately touched her to see if she was real and she was and i asked her what she was doing here at the middle of the night she looked at me confused and told me she was getting ready to go to work and then i ran to the bedroom and went to look who i kissed then and who was next to me but the bed was empty she followed me and asked me what i was doing and then i told her she was freaked out herself and told me she was already up from half past 4 so nobody was next to me since then but i was sure and i'm still sure at this day that something or somebody was lying next to me and she looked exactly as my girlfriend. And until this day nothing ever happend like that except sometimes i have the feeling that someone or something is on my terras at night or when i have my headphones on and im playing a game or doing some work on my computer and everyone is a sleep i still hear my name called out to me trough out my headphones. So yeah guys this is a little story of my own. And one of the many reasons why i'm in to such things.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nYou never know what can happen at night so stay safe people.",

        "text": "I have several different \"dreamscapes\" so to speak. Ones where I'm lucid dreaming, ones where I have sleep paralysis and ones where I'm passive dreaming. In the last scenario I usually wake up with the \"feeling\" the dream evoked but no real memory of the events.\n\nBut, a month or so ago I had a passive dream that shook me to my core. I've shared it with friends and I've shared it with family. The whole story is so cinematic sometimes I catch myself thinking maybe I accidentally did a Helen Keller with \"The Frost King\".\n\nThe set up:\n\nI'm a very directionally challenged person. My sheltered upbringing meant I was chaperoned everywhere, I never ventured out in the streets myself. I would be completely lost two streets from my house is how bad it is. It was only after I left the city for college did I even get permission to take ubers to places. In my country ubers aren't as pricey as they are in America so I ubered everywhere often. \n\nI returned home for summer break and I took an uber back home from a close friend's house once. For the first time I noticed the streets and shops on my journey. This stuck with me quite a bit so much so that I dreamt about them. \n\nThe dream:\n\nI'm taking an uber to my friend's house. The familiarity of these streets that I just recently memorized lulled me to comfort. I didn't question the reality of the \"dreamscape\". I get to her house. It's a 3 storey building and they've rented out the ground floor to another family. I make my very familiar way up the stairs. And then another set of stairs after greeting her mother. The stairs lead to the same two rooms that belong to her and her sister and one last door leading into the terrace. \n\nSo far so good. Absolute familiarity. In fact even more so because the anxiety of having traversed a path that was unknown to me until now has subsided after entering her very familiar house. I stepped in excited to greet her but am instead faced with someone unfamiliar. I smile a polite smile and open my mouth to ask for the whereabouts of my friend when the other girl greets me. \n\nGreets me in a manner so eerily similar to my friend. The inflection, the word, the dorky nickname she uses for me. Every single word is that of my friend's but the person saying it is a stranger. I feel lightheaded. I feel the anxiety I felt out on those streets that I didn't know until very recently except much worse. \n\nI don't know if I should sit down and see if it plays out into a sick prank. A prank that's uncharacteristic of my friend. A prank that is virtually impossible to pull off to this level of perfection. \n\nInstead, I mutter that I'm sick. And just like my friend would this girl—thing that sounds like my friend—asks me to lay down on my friend's bed as she does her chores. My friend's chores. Again I'm struck by the familiarity of her actions and the unfamiliarity of her form. I feel unsafe. So I insist that I return home and text her when I feel better. \n\nAnd I bolt. I take another cab. This time homeward bound. I don't need newfound familiarity. I need familiarity that's been with me for decades. My whole life. I need my mom. I'm shaking in my seat as the cab rushes home, I'm not paying attention to anything. I'm ignoring the text that's from my friend. \n\nThe cab halts in front of my apartment. I enter the building. Noticing my dad's car. I notice my neighbour's cars. They're all here. The same exact ones I remember. I alight my rickety old elevator. The build of it is modern but its little more than a tin bucket in an old well attached to a rusty pulley. I step out into the familiarly messy foyer. Our shoes littered about, strewn around a shoe rack much too small to hold our plentiful footwear. Good. But no. Here's the real test. With shaking hands I ring my doorbell. \n\nMy dog goes into overdrive at the sound. As he always does. I wait for someone to get the door as I always do. I know everyone in my house is waiting for someone else to do it. My dog's barking becomes more incessant as I ring the doorbell a second time to indicate my urgency. \n\nThe door opens. \n\nAnd relief washes over me. It's my mom. The same lines on her face. The same clothes dirtied from various food stains. The same frizzy hair, too thin and tiny, braided without a hair tie. I almost sink to the floor in relief. The fear I held in waiting to gush out as tears and she speaks. Over my dog's barking. Behind the grilled door. \n\n\"Yes? Who are you here for?\"",

        "text": "My life is boring. I'm a student at a boring university in a boring town. In my free time, I usually sit in my tiny boring student room with my boring computer, having to listen to my boring roommate and her boring boyfriend's loud conversations. For a long while, I have felt that my life is too routine. I do the same boring shit every single day. I felt a need for more excitement in my life.\n\nSince I was 15 I have always been interested in places that most people do not really know of. Places that have stood abandoned for many years. Places that, if you enter them, you stand the risk of getting arrested. Reading about these places on Reddit always excited me. I wanted to go to them, I wanted the adrenaline and fear that came with them. Watching other people on YouTube exploring old hotels, warehouses, malls or even bowling alleys made me jealous. I watched people getting chased by dogs or cops, people finding creepy items or encountering homeless addicts, and that only made me want to visit an abandoned place more. Because my life was so boring, the adrenaline was very alluring to me. And so I did some research. \n\nI had only been a student at my university for a couple of months. I was in a new town, with new places to explore. After doing some googling I found out that there in fact was an abandoned place where I live, not too far from me. Of course, I was intrigued. I needed to spice up my life, and unlike other people my age I did not want to do that by partying or hooking up. I wanted to spice my life up by adding some danger to it. From what I read the place did not seem that special. It was not an entire hotel or some mall, it was only an old underground tunnel that used to be a passage for car traffic. It felt like the perfect place for a beginner to explore. It had not been in use for over 20 years, and it seemed that not that many urban explorers had been there before me. \n\nI have some friends but none of them would ever be interested in putting themselves in danger just to seek some thrill (understandable, but boring). My friends are the kind of people who like to sit in a circle while drinking and playing games. That can be fun, of course, but it is not very exciting. So, I went alone. Stupid decision, I know. I am a young and short female who decided to go to an abandoned place after dark on my own. I was naive and thought that nothing could ever happen to me, but something did. And after my experience, you best believe that I will not explore alone, or at all, ever again.\n\nIt was a Saturday night when I decided to take my bike and go to the tunnel. With me, I brought a flashlight, an army knife, pepper spray and my camera. At least I brought some protection, right? But that did not help me from getting traumatized, maybe for life. It had already gotten dark out and before leaving I checked the time on my computer monitor. It was 22:04, so not that late. This was during autumn though, so the natural light had run out for the day. I left my room and locked the door after me. My roommate is a nice girl but I don't fully trust her yet, hence locking it. When I left she had the door to her room open, as always, and therefore saw me leaving. I did not tell her where I was going, only that I was taking a walk. \n\nOnce I got out of my apartment building I unlocked my bike and started my journey towards the tunnel. I had found the coordinates online and was finding my way to them with the help of google maps on my phone. To get there, I had to bike thru a wooded area. The path was not lit up, the only reason that I could see anything was because of my bike light. It was scary, but I enjoyed the fear. At least I was feeling something. I thought it was great, I already felt more alive and I had not even reached my destination yet. Suddenly, my GPS said to turn left, into the woods. It would have been impossible to take my bike because there was no path and the terrain did not seem friendly. Therefore, I left my bike on the path and locked it. I turned my bike light off and suddenly, I was standing in complete darkness. The only sound was the wind blowing the leaves, and some ruffling of trees from a deer or something. I took a deep breath and turned on the flashlight that I had brought with me. It was a cheap flashlight, and the light it emitted was far from satisfactory. I could really only see a couple of meters in front of me. Nothing scary had really happened yet but I still felt uneasy. I started to regret coming there but thought that I might as well get to the tunnel. Quickly, I started to make my way thru the forest. I felt scared and sort of observed. In reality, I knew that no one was out there. It was half past ten at night in the middle of the forest on a Saturday. No one was crazy enough to take a stroll at this time, except for me I guess.\n\nEventually, I reached the tunnel. If I wasn't scared before I definitely was now. The inside of the tunnel was dark and seemed to go on forever. The outside was covered with demonic symbols and, of course, phallic objects spray painted on the wall. Above the tunnel, someone had written 'Stay out, or die' in red paint. None of this made me want to leave though. I just figured that some bored teenagers from the town had painted it all. To be fair, there was not a lot to do around here. With that, I entered the tunnel. The ground in there was slightly moist, and I could hear dripping sounds around me. Stupidly enough I was wearing sneakers, and the dirty liquid from the ground made them soaked right away. I still kept going, I would just clean the shoes later. The graffiti from outside the tunnel continued on the tunnel walls, with more cryptic symbols and warnings. I kept going, knowing that this was something that was common in abandoned places. \n\nThe tunnel was not that interesting, to be honest. Sure, it was thrilling being there at night, but there were not a lot of things to discover. A pit started to form in my stomach. I did not really know why, nothing had happened to make me scared but something just did not feel right. I shined my light on one of the tunnel walls and immediately jumped back and, I am embarrassed to say, let out a high-pitched scream, which echoed thru the tunnel. I thought I had seen a ghost or something, but after looking at the wall I could see that it was just a demonic-looking face painted on there. I chuckled a little to myself. How could something so stupid have scared me like that? I must have really been on edge. My momentary relief was quickly gone when I shined my flashlight on the ground in front of the face. There, on the ground, I could see some dirty blankets and a pillow. At the time I couldn't understand why it was there, but it definitely freaked me out a bit. Was someone living in this tunnel? I started to feel very uneasy again and wanted to leave. I took a photo of the face and the bed, just to document that I had been there, and started to walk towards the exit. That is when I heard footsteps coming into the tunnel. That was scary enough, but what made it worse was that they came from the direction I had come from, the direction which was my way out. I froze for a second, not knowing what to do. Eventually, before the person could get any closer, I snapped out of my haze and started running the other way, further into the tunnel. This seemed like my best option at the time, and knowing what I know now I can confirm that it was.\n\nWhen I started running, so did the other person. I could hear the footsteps speeding up behind me. While running I started to take my army knife out of my pocket. I know that running with a knife in itself is dangerous, but at least I could protect myself if the person caught up to me. The tunnel was not as long as I thought and eventually, I reached its other end. In my panicked state, I had not noticed that the footsteps behind me had prevailed. But once I had left the tunnel, I noticed it. Still, I kept running. At that moment I thought that I had to get back to my bike, so I started going thru the forest, running beside the hill which the tunnel went thru. During my run, at various moments, I could swear that I heard branches breaking around me. It might have been paranoia though because it would not have been possible for the person to catch up to me at this point. When I found the path where my bike stood again I felt a small sense of relief. Once I reached the bike, I quickly unlocked it and raced home. Not until I reached my apartment building did I start to calm down slightly. That is when I noticed a note in my bicycle basket. I put my bike away and ran into my dorm room, with the note in hand. \n\nOnce I had locked the door behind me, I sat down. I was still in a state of shock at this point. Had someone really just chased me? Why did I put myself in such danger? Slowly I opened up the note. The contents of it was short, but terrifying:\n\n\"Hello pretty girl. I have not met you yet but I am excited to do so.\"\n\nThe fact that this was left in my bicycle basket means that this person must have been somewhere in the forest, observing me while I left my bike. If not, how did they know that I was a girl? The note was not exactly threatening, but with context it was definitely yarring. This person had been by themselves, in the forest at night, observing me and then following me. Thank God I noticed their footsteps in time, otherwise I might not have been writing this right now.\n\nI still don't know who chased me that night, and I will not be going back to find out. I assume that the person who chased me is the same person who lives in the tunnel. Just think about what kind of state you must be in to find shelter in such a place. Either this person was on drugs or in a very bad mental state, probably both.\n\nAfter this experience, I am definitely not going anywhere be myself at night. And to the person who might be reading this, do NOT go to abandoned places alone. No matter how thrilling or enticing it might seem, it is not worth the risks.",

        "text": "It all started on June 15th 2012. I was 5. \n\nI slipped out of my clothes I wore on the plane ride and put on my comfy stitch pajamas. I sluggishly drifted over to my bed and tucked myself under my covers. As I began to fall asleep, I heard something from the other side of my room. I thought it was my overactive imagination beginning to stir as I became drowsy. A shadow crept its way across the length of my window, followed by a long screech that felt as though it shook the entire house along with me. I squeezed my eyes closed tight hoping it was just the summer winds shaking a tree branch, but I knew it was real. I knew something was out there. \n\n\nI woke up sometime later to a sudden creak from what sounded like the old hardwood floors. I felt something lurk closer to me. I flipped over in my bed to face the presence thinking it was my mom or dad coming to check on me. It was odd. A “human” stood in front of me but I knew it was not human. The built up scream pressed hard against the back of my eyes. I choked down the scream, maybe it wouldn’t know I was here if I was silent. Something about it was off. It’s eyes were too shallow, its face was sunken in. It’s skin was too pale, like they’d never gone outside. I could see its long legs, that were human like, but at the knee, it bent the tiniest bit the wrong way. I saw its mouth, it curled into a sinister grin that reminded me of the joker. It crept closer as I tried to shut my eyes. “It’s a dream!” I told myself. It inched closer. It’s mouth opened to utter words. I saw it’s curly tongue stretch along it’s mouth. \n\n\n“Hello” It oozed out of its mouth. The voice was the same. Inhuman and human at the same time. It was dark and rich but there was a tip of bloodlust and anger. It sounded like black sludge dripping from a crispy apple. I tried to scream but I was too scared. I clasped my hands over my mouth and shoved my head under my pillow. \n\n\nI waited what felt like years with my head buried between the bed and my pillow. I could see a tiny crack of light seeping into my room. I gained the confidence to peak out of my pillow. It was gone. I could not move from my spot for hours. Even when my parents came to make sure I was okay, I could not speak. \n\nAfter a few hours, I felt a sharp pain of hunger hit me. I knew I had to get up now. I convinced myself it was okay. It was gone now. I pushed myself out of bed and down the hall to the kitchen. I felt, while I was walking, that something was watching me. I could see black figures out of the corner of my eye. I held my arms close to myself and ran down the hall to the brightly lit kitchen. I finally ate enough food to last me days if I just stayed in my bed. I ran back, slipped into my bed again and wrapped myself up. Rule number 1, if you’re being stalked, they can’t get you under the covers.\n\nI woke up later, it was pitch black out. I opened my eyes groggily and saw it. It was standing in the corner of the room, watching. Its neck was cocked like a dog hearing a loud noise. I stared at it, it seemed even more human. It’s face was less sunken in and its smile was less curled. But I knew it still wasn’t human. Its eyes were still dead and its skin was as pale as the moons glow. I couldn’t move, scream, nothing. I just sat there not knowing what to do. It quickly cocked its head back into a “normal” position and stepped closer to me. My room wasn’t that big. A 15x15 at best. It standing in the corner was only around 8 feet away from me. With its long legs, it took 4 steps to be right at the edge of my bed. This time it didn’t open its mouth to say hello. It just stood, staring. I couldn’t figure out anything by looking at its eyes. They were dead, nothing happening behind them. No calculating, no figuring out the best way to attack. I again decided to retreat to under my pillow and wait it out.\n\nI slept the whole next day, when I woke up the sun was just setting. I decided not to get up. I wasn’t hungry. I sat in my bed hoping it didn’t come back tonight. I drifted back to sleep.\n\nI woke again to a cracking noise. I looked up and again, it stood in the corner peering at me. Its neck was bent in strange ways and I could see its face. I think it realized I was awake now, since it bent its neck back into an upright position. I wanted to scream now. I didn’t know if it was “it” anymore. I looked too human. It’s eyes were the only thing that weren’t “alive” It began walking over to me. I could hear the shuffling of shoes on the floor. I could see its “human” mouth open, it still had the long curled tongue. I watched, for the third night, as it came close to my bed. This time was different though. I could feel it’s hot breath on my face. It spoke again. “Hello…” This time the voice was human. Really human. It had emotion. Emotions of anger. Rage. I could see it eyes widen and it’s smile curl again. “Come…With me.” It reached its hand out and waited for me. I touched it hand, my hands shaking. I touched its cold hands. I looked up and it smiled again, its lips were pursed. It let my hand go. And just as fast as I appeared, I watched it vanish. Memories of death rushed into my head. I could see bodies surrounding me. I shook my head to get the memories out. But they continued. I waited as the memories dissipated and I saw it. It was standing in the middle of the bodies. It held up a sign that read “Thank you. Now I can rest. I could not with these memories. Please. Stay safe. The memories will be passed to the next person you touch.” I was horrified. I just stayed in bed, not knowing what to do. \n\nNow, I’m 16. I have not touched another person in 11 years. My parents didn’t understand at first but they ended up leaving me be. I’d throw a tantrum anytime the tried to touch me. They think I don’t love them. I just don’t want this to be put onto someone else. I’m worried it will come back, not for me but for the person with the memories. As long as I don’t touch anyone, it’ll all be okay…I assume. I was too young to question what this was, but I was glad it was gone. To this day, I’m still not sure what it was, but it was not human.",

        "text": "  So.. I almost didn't want to put this out.\n\n\n  Mainly for the trauma that i endured when this incident took place. I went through a lot of therapy to where I am now. \n\n\n  I already told my wife this story and she gave me some heartfelt compassion that all wives do and i know she meant it. Anyway so back in 1995 I was just a teenager at 16 who already had been working at the local Blockbuster in my town for a couple of months.\n\n\n Now I know most of the people know what Blockbuster was since their shut down and if you don't well you have the damn internet for Christ's sake.\n\n\n Now to make one thing clear back then I really loved Blockbuster. I thought that working there would be the best job ever and it was. It was just that one experience and you know that one saying everyone hears, \"One Bad Apple Spoils The Whole Bunch\".\n\n\n Yeah it did. Spoiled the whole fucking thing.\n\n\n  To give you an idea what my job was back then at Blockbuster I was one of them movie rewinder's. In the returns I would grab a VHS pop it in the VCR and press the rewind button. That's what I got payed for and loved it. \n\n\n Now one thing I would hate is the way the VHS's were all piled up. Everyone just throws it in the basket like they have somewhere to go in a hurry. \n\n\n I would've liked it if they were stacked like a Jenga tower.\n\n\n Anyway so one night(I worked night shift for a couple hours before the next employee came in.) I got the bin and replaced it with another like every night and looked at my next haul with more disapointment. \n\n\n  \"One day you'll come to me in a nice stack wont you?\" I say to it knowing I'm by myself in the back while Fred is at the cashier.\n\n\n  So I grabbed a random flick and put it in.\n\n\n I made a little game to where when I rewind the tape I will press play, pause the scene, and guess the movie. It's pretty fun if you don't watch a lot of them. After a while when there was only four tapes left and I got the recent one right(Terminater!),\n\nI grab another tape and looked at it.\n\n\n Then I thought,\"shit someone must've threw in one of their home tapes by accident\". Cause it was one of those blank VHS tapes with nothing on them but a white strip and it said \"Home Movie\" on it.\n\n\n Then like they always say,\" Curiosity killed the cat\".\n\n\n I popped the tape in thinking I would just take a quick peep before handing it over to Fred.\n\n\n So I did the rewind, pause, wait a minute, and then pressed play. \n\n\n All I saw was darkness but you can hear a terrified woman breathing and someone walking on top of her. Now when I say on top of her it was like she was laying underneath wood so I guess it was a coffin.\n\n\n My first thought was ok maybe this was an actual movie and they just lost the case. But my curiosity kept on bugging me so I sat aside the tape and did the 4 others(Child's Play, Alien 2, Christine, and It.) Then I clocked out for the night.\n\n\nWhen I came back the next day I went through the bins as quickly as I could so I can watch the tape.\n\n\n Honestly though I'll tell is that this is how it starts. Woman lying in a coffin with dirt coming in every few seconds.\n\n\n I skipped for a while and pressed play again this time to her saying,\"Please! For they love of god let me out!(sounded like she was crying). Then I skipped a few more like I did the last time and heard someone above her say,\" you should have never cheated on me!\" She then says to him,\" I don't know you!!\".\n\n\n For real though, if this was an actual movie and not a home movie, this probably would've broke the box office like Paranormal Activity did cause the woman was displaying the raw human emotion we all know.\n\n\n I skipped a few again and pressed play to where you now hear a car driving away and the woman going,\"No! No! Noooo!\" And a bit more crying. \n\n\n I skipped for what seemed like an hour through the tape and for the last time ever, i pressed the play button.\n\n\n What I saw nearly froze my heart to death. It was the woman sounding like she was about to die and then out of the darkness towards her feet, a white hairless like creature with elongated limbs crawls out of the darkness towards her.\n\n\n  Mine and the woman's breathing sounded alike right then.\n\n\n  As it came out it opened it's large mouth as wide as it can and you see it breathing in something. I can't hardly even describe it but it was like the thing was breathing in a rainbow like air substance into its mouth coming from the woman.\n\n\n The woman during this was just shaking inside the coffin. I skipped through and it seemed the creature was in there with her a lot. Then when it looked like it got done and i pressed play.\n\n\n The woman has stopped moving completely. The rainbow like substance the creature was breathing in was also gone. Then it went to go back towards the end of the coffin to the darkness and then it stops.\n\n\n It turns and sharply looks at the camera. I almost fell out of my chair. Cause it was staring at me. I really mean AT me. I was scared but then calmed down. I don't know how but it looked like it was telling me to call someone that day.\n\n\n  So I called the cops.\n\n\n        * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n After I called the cops they disclosed to me what happened. \n\n \n\n A serial killer has been going around and kidnapping women that resembled his ex - wife. He would then go and bury them alive and what they found with them was a VHS tape. \n\n\n They said So far he was the one sending them the messages to find the bofie's includong a VHS tape of the victims. They Then said he must've accidentally put one of these tapes in the return bin. They said they were sorry for what happened and they will catch the guy.\n\n\n The thing that traumatized me wasn't mostly the tape it was the creature. Tge creature the other cops said the didn't even see when they were watching the footage.\n\n\n They never did catch him last time i checked.\n\n\n                * * * * * * * * * * * * \n\n\n  Now that I've giving you my story just know this is not over. I think the killer is planning to use ne as his messenger now. Cause FedX dropped off a box at my house and said it was for me.\n\n\n When I put it in the house and opened it since the wife is at wotk. What I found made me fall to the floor in fear.\n\n\n  Inside the boxes were VHS tapes and they all had the words,\" HOME Movies\".\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  ",

        "text": "My wife, Kate, sometimes calls me “Jack” when she gets upset. My name is Tom. “Jack” was the name of my wife’s first husband, and that’s pretty much all I know about him. Kate was reluctant to talk about the marriage. It was unusually brief and, from what I gather, wholly unpleasant. I did my best not to pry.   Still, the idea that there was a man before me would sometimes tug on my insecurities. I usually kept my feelings to myself as I didn’t want to open any old wounds.\n\nBut now I’m starting to wonder what happened to him. \n\nI met Kate shortly after I finished my undergrad at the Houston Symphony. I’m not sure why I went since I never preferred classical music, but I couldn’t complain about free tickets. Unbeknownst to me, I would sit next to my future wife during Mozart’s Requiem. Kate and I talked the whole time. It was like I had known her for years. I mustered up the courage to ask her to dinner and have been madly in love ever since.\n\nKate was a bit older than me, which I had no problem with. She was just finishing up her psychiatry residency when we first met. Kate came from a wealthy and posh English family with long ties to the banking industry and scientific discovery. They intimidated me because I was the first person in my family to even complete high school. We didn’t see Kate’s family much, and I got the impression that they disapproved of our relationship. But that didn’t matter to Kate. She loved me for who I was. We eloped after only six months of dating and moved in together. Kate started her practice in our new home, and life began to make sense. I didn’t have to worry about money anymore, and Kate suggested I quit teaching to focus more on my novel.\n\nI’ve been writing a book, but my creativity and willpower took a dive when I started teaching. Sitting at my desk all day was dull and isolating. I sometimes wondered if I was even meant to be a writer. To decompress, I’d take walks in the park and watch the landscapers cut the grass and trim the hedges. I felt an odd kinship toward them and fantasized about riding on one of their lawnmowers in the hot sun. Anything was better than being crammed at my desk. But I knew Kate would be disappointed if I gave up writing entirely.\n\nThe boredom got to me one day. I just couldn’t stand being trapped in my study for another eight hours. Kate was at a medical conference, so I had the whole house to myself for a few days. After one or two bottles of wine, I found myself standing outside Kate’s office. Kate was very protective of her office space, and I couldn’t step foot in there unless I brought her lunch. But I was drunk, and my curiosity got the better of me, so I went in.\n\nKate’s office was smaller than I remembered. It had olive green walls and was usually dimly lit with candles. There was a relaxing waterfall fountain in the back corner, and when you lay on the chaise lounge, you felt like you were in a tropical paradise. I sat down to clear my head when I noticed another door in the room. I was sure I had never seen it before. I opened the door and was greeted by a black room with sound-proofed walls. In the middle of the room was a tiny round table with two lounge chairs was in the middle of the room. An old lightbulb hung from the ceiling. What the hell was this place? It felt strangely familiar, and I felt anxious when I explored it.\n\nIn the corner of the room was a dusty filing cabinet. It must have contained patient records. I know I shouldn’t have opened it, but I was still inebriated enough to do something irresponsible. I opened the top drawer, but it only contained one thing, a wrinkled composition notebook. I picked up the notebook and realized it was someone else’s journal. The first date was almost ten years ago. Written on the top margin in faded black ink: Jack Taylor.\n\nI rushed back to my study and slammed the door. I knew I would feel terrible for invading Kate’s privacy once I sobered up, but I started reading the journal anyway. The first entry was short, and many words were either crossed out or misspelled. \n\n“Dr. Kate said I should keep a journal to write down my thoughts. She said it will help me feel better. So here they are. My name is Jack Taylor. I’m 25 years old. I was born in Waco. I like to be outside. I like to watch the Cowboys on Sunday. I like to drink Lonestar beer. That’s all I guess.”\n\nI almost started laughing. No wonder their marriage didn’t last very long! This guy was a total dud and not at all Kate’s type. I wonder what she saw in him. I decided to keep reading as my ego prevented me from not making fun of this guy. I glossed over to the next entry.\n\n“I showed Kate my first page, and she got mad at me. She said that this journal was for ‘feelings and emotions.’ Well, excuse me! It was her idea in the first place! I feel bad I guess. She’s so smart. And I’m me. Just a gardener. I’ll have my own business someday, though. Then I’ll ask Kate to marry me.”\n\nI started to feel bad after the second passage. Jack may have been a bit dim, but I could definitely empathize with him. I always felt like I needed to be better for Kate. It could be hard to be with someone so much more accomplished than yourself.  I mulled over whether or not I wanted to continue reading but decided to keep going. The following passage was dated almost a year later.\n\n“I know it’s been a while since I’ve written in this journal because I decided to only write when I felt depressed. Kate keeps bringing up the idea of me going back to school, and while that sounds nice, I’m content with our life. I enjoy writing and even have ideas for a book, but I’m not sure I want to return to college. The landscaping business is doing better than anticipated. It’s blue-collar work, and I know Kate is embarrassed because her family back in Cornwall disapproves. However, we said our vows, which should mean more to her. I’ll talk to her tomorrow. I need to put my foot down.”\n\nI stopped reading to pour another glass of wine. It was interesting to hear Jack’s perspective on his marriage to Kate. Kate never outright said anything nasty about Jack, but I always got the feeling that *he* was solely the problem.  I guess situations are always more complicated than they seem. I flipped to the next page with a different perspective. Plus, his writing had improved dramatically since his first entry.\n\n“The fighting with Kate is getting worse. Why can’t she just accept me for who I am? I will never be the sensual, introspective novelist that she desires. I have a business to run. A business, I might add, that has paid for this house and extra additions for her new office once she finishes her residency. I’m just so exhausted from the constant mental gymnastics with her!  It’s almost like she’s trying to conform me to her weird fantasy. I like what I do!” \n\nI shook my head and took another sip of wine. It was almost surreal reading Jack’s journal. We were more similar than I had initially thought. Was Kate doing the same thing to me? I really enjoyed teaching, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough for her. I kept reading.\n\n“Last night, I had that terrible nightmare again. I dreamt I was sitting in a dark room and sitting at a chipped wooden table. Kate was there too, and she kept turning the light on and off while saying terrible things to me. Before I woke up, she was screaming, almost foaming at the mouth. I’ve never seen her that angry before. I haven’t been able to sleep very well recently, and I honestly don’t feel like myself anymore. I’ve called in sick to work for the past three days. I thought being outside would help me breathe again, but working is the last thing I want to do. Perhaps Kate is right. Maybe a change of scenery would be helpful for me.”\n\nI froze after I read the last page. The room Jack dreamt about had to be the same in Kate’s office. Was Kate doing something to him? I crept back to Kate’s office and slipped into the room again. It felt even smaller this time, and the feelings of anxiousness rose from my stomach again. I grasped my chest, struggling to breathe until I thought I was almost suffocating. What was going on with me? My knees started to buckle, and I slid into the cold wooden table’s only chair. I looked up, and it felt like the vantablack walls slowly moved toward me. I mustered up all my strength and threw myself at the filing cabinet to put Jack’s journal back. This time, I knocked over a small manila folder from the top of the cabinet. Was this here before? I grabbed it and rushed out of the room, collapsing on Kate’s chaise lounge. \n\nI quickly came back to my senses and inspected the folder. It was filled with documents and on the corner was a rectangular blue sticker labeled “Jack Taylor.” Inside were patient records and various essays scribbled with handwriting that looked like Kate’s. *Was Jack Kate’s patient before they were married?* That didn’t make any sense. Kate hadn’t even started her practice when we got married. How was she already treating patients? And to marry one? Kate was almost paranoid about following ethical guidelines. To break her oath seemed unfathomable to me. \n\nAgainst my best judgment, I opened the folder and combed through the pages. Jack was undergoing treatment for dissociative identity disorder and depression. Early forms of therapy weren’t helping, and Kate wrote in her notes that she would try a controversial form of treatment as an alternative. Hypnosis. My eyes immediately darted to the corner room, the door still hanging wide open, revealing an abyss. *So that’s what the room was for.* \n\nI kept flipping through the pages and found through Kate’s notes that the therapy seemed to be working, though Jack’s disorder desperately tried to fight it. There were several documents on hypnotherapy and a letter from a former professor on his experience implementing the procedure. I knew from Jack’s journal that he had vague memories of being hypnotized and that they manifested into his dreams. This was wrong.\n\nA photograph slid out of one of the papers in the folder. I picked it up to examine it. It was a picture of Kate and a man I assumed to be Jack. He was burly, with cropped black hair, a bushy beard, and an apparent farmer’s tan. He looked familiar, but I didn’t think I had ever seen him before. \n\nMaybe I learned too much about this man, but I’m deciding to confront Kate about him. She always preaches that honest conversations strengthen relationships, so now is the time.  I’m going to finish up writing here and then wait for Kate to get home. It may be painful, but I need to do this for myself. And maybe even for Jack, whereve r he m ay beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n\nI suppose I owe you an explanation. I’m honestly impressed at how much of a sleuth you are. I have no idea how you came across Tom’s musings, though it does not matter. Fine, I will grant you this one favour. Jack came to me as a patient in the early 2000s. He was a gardener who drove his large truck through a bar during a manic episode. I must admit, he was quite striking when I met him. Tall, muscular, and hairy. Exactly my type, *physically.* He wasn’t, oh how do you Americans say this, the sharpest knife in the drawer. \n\nBut what if he could be? What if he could be convinced over time that he was the man of my dreams? Hypnosis is a tricky procedure, and it takes years to bind someone to your will. I hit an impasse after Jack and I were married. Until I had an epiphany. “Jack Taylor” would never be a romantic writer who would serenade me with poems and beach novellas. But “Tom Rhoades” could be. I didn’t need to bend someone to my will; I needed to get them to believe they were not the person they thought they were. Through hypnosis, a gardener could become a novelist. Plus, I always preferred the name Tom. \n\nThe experiment went extraordinarily well at first, but alas, Tom’s disorder was incredibly resilient. It was like his DID was leading him to the truth in a twisted and cruel way. I knew he was getting close to finding out when he started writing less and drinking more. I told him I was going to a news conference and let him figure out the truth for himself. \n\nWhere is he now? Oh, darling, I would not worry about Tom anymore. He is job is done, and he is now at peace. I am ready to close the chapter on this experiment. I’m done with using hypnosis for love. But you?\n\n**WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH YOU?**",

        "text": "Hello, My names Axel and i love everything creepy. But this just unnerves me on so many levels.\n\nI moved in the summer of 2022. Theres a park nearby, walking distance. Ive been there a plentiful amount of times and i love the park. But half of those time i see something running through the trees. This last time it was more worry some. \n\nDecember 30th 2022\n\nI was getting ready to go on another walk. I was sure i would encounter a weirdo as i did the last time i was there but getting there was smooth sailing. I pack my headphones, phone and throw on a coat. I walk out and pass the apartment complex as i make my way to the gate. I always get a feeling of dread when I enter this park. I walk up the path, past the floor control dugout and up the hill towards the swing set. I hop on it and get a bit of momentum. A few minutes passed of just me swinging and listening to music and as i looked back towards the direction of my home, which was downhill and had a patch of thick trees i swear i see something run from one tree to the other pretty far away. I stare for a bit and nothing happens. The moment i look away it happens again and it moves closer. I stare and nothing. I look away and its just me for a minute but then it happens again. It was now at a tree at the bottom of the hill near the road that leads to where i was. I took off my headphone on one ear and listened. At which point it came closer. It was now in the middle of the hill and just to prove i wasn’t hallucinating like do when I’m in the dark i heard a crack. Distant but vivid. I got off the swing set and tried texting one of my friends. I skip the sidewalk and begin running straight down the hill. I stumble a bit but soon reach the sidewalk again. I glance back and see something on top of the hill. I run to the gate and slow down. I make it out and continue walking home. I turn back as i near the office of my apartments. \n\nI see someone the height of a grown man standing there.. smiling. Thats the only thing i could make out in the dim lighting of the streetlamp at the edge of the park. No face, no clothing, no define area of where their body parts are, just that sickening smile. I got lucky that time and Im worried what will happen when i go back. This scared me and this isn’t the first time this has happened. But I’ve never actually seen the thing till then. I hear knocking and I’m trying to ignore it. It wants in. It knows i know it exists. Im its prey, its food. My dog is the only one awake with me, glaring at the door. Its getting louder and i can hear it saying something.. it sounds like me.\n\nNot saying..\n\nIts singing one of my favorite songs.",

        "text": "[1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zcnfhw/what_did_we_see_on_the_beach_in_north_carolina/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nOk, so I guess hey again. If you read my last post you understand that shit sort of “went down” over the summer. If you haven’t read my last post, well I guess the best way to explain it is that shit sort of  “went down” over the summer. I’ll link it here, honestly you’ll be pretty lost so I kinda recommend reading it. Long story short, saw a giant thing on the beach, it made weird sounds, and we left. \n\nWhat I’m writing right now is picking up just about two weeks ago. After about a few days of me and Griffin texting DJ trying to convince him to come with us back to North Carolina, somehow we eventually got through to him. Which, I’ll be honest I wasn’t expecting, like at all. Out of all of us he seemed to be the most freaked out by the whole situation. To be fair we were all pretty shaken up, I didn’t really hide my emotions too well but compared to DJ I was doing just fine. Pretty much everytime we brought up the whole situation he would just sorta shut down. It really fucked with him. But I guess he was also the one who was most intrigued by it. Despite how we all felt about the situation and how terrified we may have been, it was unanimous that we had to go back to confirm what we saw. \n\nThe whole trip was pretty short notice, by December 7th we had decided to go and by the 9th we had the house booked. We were even able to get the same house as last time. I mean it wasn’t like we were fighting with other renters to get a hold of it, not too many people are trying to rent a beach house in mid December. Not to mention since it was the off season the price was lower, which meant we were able to afford to just go with the three of us. We all decided to leave the girls behind because: 1) we didn’t want them to get freaked out anymore than they already were, and 2) they never even saw the Sand Walker, so in reality they didn’t really have much to do with it. Not to mention it was unanimously agreed upon that none of us wanted to get the girls involved just in case anything happened. \n\nMy Dad dropped me off at Griffin's house the morning of the 14th. I got there around the same time as DJ and after Griffin's parents made us some breakfast we were on the road. Griffin pretty much always had a smirk on his face and practically dripped confidence. The smirk was there, the confidence was not. It was almost like he was putting on a facade to hide something. I can only assume that something he was hiding was fear.   \n\nDJ had a different method of dealing with his anxiety. His eyes were locked on the road and he remained quiet for the majority of the drive. I wanted to chalk this up to him being focused on the road but I knew he was mentally preparing himself for the days to come. I tried to break the silence by playing some music. At most this helped drown out the awkwardness that had engulfed the car.\n\nAfter the two hour mark it seemed we had settled in and DJ finally started talking. “So, how’s school been?”. It wasn’t much but it was better than nothing. Luckily this was all that was needed to get Griffin on a tangent about one of his funny yet somewhat bizarre college stories. This kickstarted what was a relatively normal car ride. Eventually we pulled into the driveway of the house and began to unload the car. It wasn’t until this moment that I realized just how each of us was affected by our encounter this last summer, and how each of us had approached this trip in our own unique ways. \n\nDJ had unloaded his three bags: his backpack, his suitcase, and then a duffle bag filled with guns. Unlike last time where DJ had packed a spikeball net and lacrosse sticks, he must’ve decided that if anything were to happen this time he would be prepared. I shifted my gaze to the left and watched Griffin swing a case of water over one shoulder and his two bags over his other. It was here that I realized his idea of prepping for this trip was to put on as much muscle as possible. Just in the few weeks since Thanksgiving he had grown significantly larger. I on the other hand had spent my time researching different mythology, zoology, and cryptozoology. It seemed we had all played to our strengths to get ready for our return to the beach. DJ with his history of hunting, Griffin with his physicality, and me with my… I don't know? Being a nerd I guess. You get the point.\n\nWe all grabbed our stuff from the car and then just sort of stood there. All of us looked out towards the beach, all of us, presumably, replaying the events of our summer vacation. The atmosphere was almost identical to the last day of our previous trip: cloudy, looked like it was about to rain, and nothing but the sound of waves crashing and seagulls chirping. The sound of the beach ambience was broken when DJ said “C'mon let’s go.” And then made his way inside. I went with shortly after, and then after a few more moments of waiting Griffin followed as well.\n\nWe unpacked our things and after settling in we went out trying to get some information from the locals. Unfortunately we didn't seem to think that almost all of the houses would be empty on account of the majority of them being summer homes. After a little over an hour of going door to door looking for someone, the sun began to set and we settled on going back to the house before we lost daylight entirely. By the time we got back to the house it was about four in the afternoon. \n\nAfter getting back to the house it was decided that we would go to this diner/barbeque place we passed on the way there for dinner. Since we didn’t have any luck talking to locals in the surrounding houses we figured that this would give us a chance to maybe get some more information. We also used this as an excuse to delay the inevitable of going back onto the beach.\n\nGriffin drove us there and after getting seated we realized just how dead this town really was during the offseason. There were only eight people in the whole restaurant, three of which were us. We ordered and had all decided that it would be best if we wait to ask about the thing we saw over the summer until after getting our food.\n\nSadly the waitress wanted nothing to do with our questions, I guess she disliked the topic so much it prompted her to bring out the busboy to make sure after finishing our food and paying we got out immediately. So we ate our food, left the cash on the table and were escorted out. Before practically throwing us from the barbeque joint the bus boy, who was more of a bus man(standing about a foot over myself), said a bit of information that actually was of some value.\n\n“Listen, I know what you boys are talkin about. Just drop it. It ain't worth the trouble you’re gonna get in” I don’t think those were his exact words but this is close enough. The weird thing is he didn’t say this as a threat, he said it as advice. Like he was looking out for us. Like this has happened before.\n\nAfter returning to the house we contemplated what to do, it was eventually decided that we would ignore the man's advice and continue on with what we came to do. We rested for only about an hour then as we all sat there in the living room, I watched as the clock went from 8:59 to 9:00. It was officially as dark as it would be getting with only the moon lighting up the beach. I looked up at Griffin and DJ, they were just sitting there staring at the guns sat on the table. I guess I had to be the one to initiate shit now so, against better judgment, I mustered up a “You guys ready?”\n\nThey both lifted their heads to look at me, Griffin had a forced smile on his face, DJ was deadpan, ready to go. There were three guns on the table, one Shotgun, one Rifle, and one Handgun. I would go into the specifics but that is genuinely all I know. DJ had given me and Griffin a quick rundown of how to shoot guns in an open field we passed on the drive down to the house, plus he had taken us shooting back in high school when he stole one of his dad's hunting rifles. DJ didn’t want us going into this without knowing how to use our guns so this little bit of shooting practice we underwent was the best we could do for the time being. DJ took the rifle because he was the best shot out of the three of us, Griffin took the handgun, and I took the Shotgun. Griffin also insisted on bringing a baseball bat that he kept in his backpack as he “wasn’t a huge fan of guns”. Honestly I’m not sure of what he planned to do with this but whatever made him feel better I guess. \n\nIt had been discussed previously that we weren’t here to hunt the Sand Walker, but just observe and if we’re lucky get a picture. But the guns were our contingency plan. Along with the guns, we each had flashlights on us and Griffin even had his GoPro strapped to his chest. We all looked at each other and knew it was time to go out there.\n\nThe cold air flooded into the house as we opened the door to the porch and looked out onto the beach. This gave Nothing but the sound of waves crashing and wind blowing. The only thing was we couldn’t even tell if it was authentic or if it was being replayed by that thing. And I won't bore you with the details, because there are none. We were on that beach from nine until midnight and there was nothing. No monster, no weird sounds, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nThis, for lack of a better term, pissed us off. It made us feel crazy, made us question what we all had seen. We decided we’d go back to the house and try again the next night. We didn’t get that chance though. Because on the way back as we walked through the sand we heard the roaring of engines. Initially we all thought it was the Sand Walker, until we then saw the light emitting from headlights fastly approaching. We all assumed that these were cops, which prompted DJ to dig his gun license out of his pocket and also had us begin to hide the other two guns in Griffin's backpack. \n\nAs the lights approached we realized these weren’t cops, they were… just regular people. All brandishing guns, we fished the guns out of the bag and stood there waiting. The three ATVs were followed by a dune buggy. In total I counted seven men, all of which were armed. They got within fifteen or so feet of us when they let up on the throttles and the engines died down. \n\nThere were a few seconds of a stare down between us and the men, within these seconds there was nothing but silence. This silence was cut off by a familiar voice saying, “Oh these fucking guys again?”\n\nI turned my gaze to face the voice and noticed that the man who was talking was the same busboy from earlier.\n\n“These are the city boys I was talkin about.”  \n\n\n“We’re not from the ci-” Griffin was interrupted by one of the men.\n\nDespite this being a beach town with a population that was made up of relatively normal suburban people, these men were different. These men were rugged, more callused, you could tell just from looking at them. They weren’t just regular people who lived in a beach town, the best way I could describe it is that they were more “outdoorsy” than the rest of us.\n\n“What the hell are you boys doin out here?” One of the men said this as he held his gun. He didn’t hold it towards us, but he was ready to fire at a moment's notice.\n\n“Don’t tell me you're tryna hunt this thing?” The busboy spoke up once again. “With a few guns and a baseball bat?”\n\nI decided since it was originally my plan to come back that I should be the one to speak up, “We’re not trying to hunt it, we just wanted to know what we saw.”\n\nThe following ten or so minutes were filled with us arguing back and forth, mainly consisting of us three leaving for our own safety. Throughout these arguments we luckily were able to gain some semi-valuable information. This was more than we expected to get when we traveled house to house looking for locals to interview. \n\nThere were three main things we gained from this conversation. The first was that every year this thing procreates and that their “litters” can consist of anywhere between ten to twenty “pups”. The second thing we learned was that the older these things get, the more docile and tranquil they become. Only coming out every few nights when no one is around, eating whatever plants are readily available. The third thing we learned was more disturbing, the Sand Walker, while docile in its older age, is incredibly hostile and aggressive in its younger years. While its more mature counterpart is herbivorous, the diet in their earlier years consists of anything they can get their hands on, including animals and in the rare case people. This is where the “hunters” we had run into come into play.\n\nThey were equipped with enough guns and bullets to take out a small army. And it became abundantly clear to us it was because they planned on taking out an entire litter of sand walkers. They said they did this to protect their town. Apparently if these things ever got out and began to “wreak havoc” as one of the men put it, the tourism in their town would plummet and the lives of a lot of people would be ruined. So every year they would “take out” the freshest batch of sand walkers. \n\nThe three of us stood there, confused and processing what we had just learned. We tried to digest the information but it was too much. \n\n“You had an encounter with the big one?” One of the bigger guys asked, we assumed that he was their leader because of how he positioned himself in the front of the group and how his voice carried a sort of authority with each word he said. \n\nDJ spoke up, “Yeah, it just sort of…” his voice trailed off and he grew silent. \n\nGriffin then took over as he realized DJ was shutting down once again like he always did when the subject was brought up. “It’s a long story. But with you guys hunting, the cops ever get calls about gunfire and shit?”\n\nThe leader just sort of chuckled “Well, allow me to introduce myself, I’m Blake. People call me Chief cause, well I’m the Chief.” He pulled out his badge and flashed it to us. I don’t know much about police badges but I’m pretty sure you can’t just acquire one so this dude was legit. “You boys ever shoot before?”\n\nDJ snapped out of it, “Been hunting since I was ten.”\n\n“You two?” the Chief asked.\n\nI’m still unsure of why but Griffin lied to the man and told him we had a decent amount of experience with guns. Despite this, the Chief instructed one of the men to get us off the beach and back to the streets to make sure we were all good. The busboy hopped from his ATV and offered to take us back. But before we could even get a few feet from the group we were distracted by a sound. It sounded like a boat blowing its horn.\n\nWe all directed our attention to the ocean, but even with our flashlights, all eleven of us were shining them across the horizon. But none of us saw anything. There was an eerie familiarity of this exact feeling, the feeling of looking out to find the sound of a boat but being met with nothing.This instantly sent a chill down my spine. \n\nThen, suddenly, the sound grew, it no longer was just one horn, but like a symphony of shitty trumpets. It seemed almost as if a bunch of car horns were going off at once, like rush hour traffic. Then I remembered the sound we had heard a few months before. It was the tugboat horn. \n\nI froze, I was absolutely paralyzed and stuck staring at Griffin and DJ. They too were frozen with fear. The mental prepping, the gun collecting, the muscle building, the monster research, everything we had all done to get ready for this trip seemed futile. As we were all overtaken with fear.\n\nI was eventually able to turn myself around and I then saw the Chief yelling but I wasn’t fully able to make out the words. It was obvious that the other men were able to hear his orders as four of them promptly lit their flares they had pulled from their bags and threw them into various spots of the beach. This provided enough light for us to see fifteen or so miniature sand walkers closing in on us. I say miniature but these things ranged anywhere between three to seven feet tall. They were slightly faster than the one we encountered over the summer but still relatively slow. \n\nWhile we stood there staring at them the Chief scrambled to us and rushed us into the dune buggy. He pulled my ear to his mouth and yelled, “Stay up there and get fucking ready!”\n\nThen, all hell broke loose. Each one of them opened fire. The flares resting in the sand grew obsolete because of how much the muzzle fire lit up the beach. The sound of the tug boat horn switched from a low rumble to a more screeching cry. Originally I mistook this as a cry of pain, but I quickly realized that it was actually a battle cry of sorts. \n\nDJ hopped off the buggy and began to do what he could in order to help. Me and Griffin on the other hand were still in total shock. I guess DJs experience with hunting had prepared him for this kind of stuff because he had some sort of instinct neither Griffin nor I possessed. \n\nI still could barely move. My hands shook with fear and my palms were cold with sweat. I turned my head to Griffin whose mouth was hung open and eyes wide with awe. My gaze then shifted to DJ whose face displayed a different kind of expression, his eyes narrowed and his teeth were gritted. He had taken his fear and turned it to rage. \n\nI tried to keep count on how many bullets it took to take just a single one of them down. The most I counted was around fifty. The least I counted was around twenty. There was the rare occasion where one of the “pups” got too close to one of the men and they would all shift their fire to focus the approaching threat. Their synchronized fire and organized demeanor made it obvious that they had done this many times previous to tonight.\n\nAfter ten minutes of nonstop gunfire it finally began to die down. Once muzzle fire stopped, the beach became illuminated by the low red glow produced by the flares that had now become slightly suppressed by sand that had been kicked up from stray bullets. With a call from the Chief, four of the men then began gathering the bodies and dragging them to form a pile. They did this while the busboy doused them in gasoline. \n\nThe chief then walked up to us, and said something to the effect of “Sorry bout that. Didn’t expect them to come out so early. Guess we got them excited.” He laughed as he said this and then lit a cigarette. Then he made some joke about how we had probably never hunted anything like that before. Honestly I don’t know exactly what happened because of how my eardrums were filled with what I can only describe as the roar of war. It was the gunfire, the screaming, the sound of the battle that had just been fought. The strangest part about all this sound was that it somehow managed to be even louder than before, despite us all having been in the center of all of it.\n\nThis sound was so powerful that it genuinely forced me to the ground. As I sat in the sand with my back pressed against the buggy I plugged my ears. Even then, I was unable to escape the sound of gunfire. I looked up and realized even the chief was stunned. He winced as he covered his ears. We all turned our gaze to the direction of the sound. That’s when we saw it, the silhouette of the Sand Walker. This was the supposedly “docile” and “peaceful” mature version, who at that moment was charging us. While I still wouldn’t consider its pace fast by any means, it was significantly faster than what I had witnessed over the summer. We could barely make it out but it couldn’t be anything else.\n\nThere was a gap in the roar of mimicked gun fire, and in that moment I could hear the Chief mutter the words “What the fuck?”. The cigarette that hung from his mouth dropped to the sand which promptly ignited the trail of gasoline that had unknowingly been building as the busboy too was frozen with fear. Within seconds the pile of corpses erupted in flames. The stench filled our noses and the flames illuminated the beach. With these growing flames we could finally clearly see this goliath charging us. It was maybe twenty yards away but it was gaining speed. \n\nGuns were drawn and tube men quickly opened fire once again. But unlike the pups, this one didn’t go down as quickly. The seven hunters, eight including DJ, were blasting bullets into this thing. One after another, there wasn’t a second where it wasn’t being pierced with someone's shot. Despite this, it didn’t stop, it hardly even slowed down. Stray fragments of sand and rock sprayed from the Sand Walker with each bullet hit but it seemed to just be filled in with some of the excess it carried upon its body.\n\nI was in such a panic from the gunfire that I hadn’t realized where exactly the Sand Walker was running to. Its path was lined up with the ignited pile of sand walkers, in front of which was DJ who stood firing his rifle from atop an ATV. Griffin must have caught on to this because suddenly he drew his gun from his holster and began rushing to DJ. As he ran he frantically fired into the approaching beast. I quickly realized that the few bullets from Griffin wouldn’t be nearly enough to do any harm. I too tried to run but my feet wouldn’t move. I still was paralyzed with fear and the roar of gunfire was still being matched with the cry of the monster. It didn’t matter that I couldn’t move though because once I finally got myself to move the Sand Walker finally reached them. Griffin stood there clicking his gun that had already run out of ammo. Griffin reached back and in a single motion pulled his bat and swung as hard as he could into the monster. It didn’t even fucking flinch, it hardly acknowleged him. Griffin drew back once again and his face dawned a furious expression of rage. I watched as the Sand Walker haphazardly swung its arm into Griffin which flung him through the air. He flew thirty or so feet where he landed somewhere in the dunes. Griffin's attempt, while futile, gave DJ enough time to fire his final two shots into its head. These two well placed shots did stun the beast but within seconds DJ too was launched by a single blow from the Sand Walkers arm.   \n\n\nWatching my friends, both of which I consider brothers, both of which were much more equipped to deal with a threat of any scale, being man handled by this thing set something off in me. It was only at this moment that I realized we really could be killed by this thing and that prompted me to open fire. I began shooting, round after round. I can still feel how much the shotgun shot back into me and how much it hurt each time it slammed against my shoulder. But my shots only seemed to get its attention as it then changed its attention from my two friends to me and the rest of the hunters. \n\nThe men continued to fire, and so did I. After the butt of the shotgun stopped firing back into my body I realized I had run out of bullets and began stumbling backwards away from the approaching beast. I hadn’t been keeping count but at this point a hundred rounds had to have been fired into it. Luckily, in its frenzy, the Sand Walker had stumbled into the flames which distracted it momentarily and allowed for a few of the men to get a couple clean shots. This must have inflicted enough damage to provoke some sort of fight or flight within it which forced it to retreat. As it then began moving down the beach all of the men stood there, eyes wide and guns following the trail left as it ran. \n\nWhat I just described may seem like it was a lengthy ordeal, but in reality I imagine it lasted no more than thirty seconds from the time we saw the grown Sand Walker charging us to the time it began to retreat. \n\nAs we all stood there Griffin came stumbling from the dunes clutching his stomach in pain. Hanging loosely from his torso was his now shattered GoPro. Two of the hunters ran to DJ and helped him to the dune buggy as he too clutched his torso.\n\nNobody said anything, it was silent for minutes as we all tried to collect our thoughts on what the fuck had just happened. The smell of the burning corpses was now replaced with the scent of gunpowder.The flares that once lit the beach were now almost completely buried by sand. We could only see what the fire and the lights of the atvs illuminated.\n\nWe didn’t wait for the sun to rise. After a few words with the men, we just packed our shit and left. The ride back was quiet, even more so than the ride there. I drove this time as DJ lied in the back seat. Griffin and I let him sleep as he seemed to catch the brunt of the damage. Luckily the only injuries we sustained were a few bruised ribs for DJ, the wind knocked out of Griffin, and the bruise on my shoulder. \n\nI pulled over at a rest stop to grab some drinks and use the bathroom about two hours into the drive. When I entered the bathroom after paying for my water I caught a glimpse of Griffin staring at himself in the mirror. I was able to notice it momentarily during my occasional glance over at him while driving, but it became clear while looking at him in the glare at his reflection that he had been drained of every ounce of his cocky frat boy charisma, and had now displayed a deadpan and defeated expression.\n\nI said the only thing I could think could possibly give him any semblance of hope, “We didn’t die, and we’re not going back.” Griffin gave a half smile, turned, and hugged me. Once we made it back to the car we gave DJ pain meds and some snacks purchased from the rest stop. \n\nWe got back to Griffin's house at 8 AM. And I was back at my home by 8:30. When I got back I stood in my shower for thirty minutes and just ran over what we had just gone through. I was mainly worried about how Griffin and DJ were doing. As I stepped from the shower I looked at my phone and saw a text message from DJ in our group chat. It read *Fuck the Sand Walker and FUCK NORTH CAROLINA.* This was followed by a text from Griffin *We fucked that mf up. Love you boys.*\n\nFuck the Sand Walker and Fuck North Carolina.",

        "text": "The new mayor of our town was elected almost a year ago now. The elections always come with some organisation and preparation, but the rules are rather simple. You can vote on a party or you can vote on a person. The person with the most votes, notwithstanding whether he belongs to the largest party or not, becomes mayor. No questions asked. And our mayor became mister Martin.\n\nMister Martin was a courteous, very well-groomed but also charismatic man and beloved by many people. Sure, there were a few who were not 100% behind his political agenda, but none of them really hated, let alone despised him. Because of his courtesy, he had no trouble putting together a coalition and making the city governable again. The city council got off with a smooth start: proposals to give vacant properties new life were approved, funding was gathered successfully to renovate the local hospital and initial building plans have also been made for a new primary school. Although there was still one big thorn in the mayor's side and that was the 127-year old cemetery which had fallen into disuse. None of the residents still had close relatives buried there. An agreement was drawn up that the remains would be exhumed. Later, a park would then come in its place. Out of respect, however, and for those who wished, a ceremony would be held on november 19th last year.\n\nHowever, the ceremony never took place. I spoke to a friend of mine who has a seat in the council and he told me that excavation of the remains had already ceased after one day. I asked him what he thought that could be the cause. Had they found bomb from the first or second world war? Were there budgetary issues which made that the excavation could not continue?\n\nAll he could tell me is that he had no record of that. A possible new date for the ceremony was also not communicated. Normally I let these things pass me by, but rumours are rising all over town. The story that recurs most often is that people, when they drive past the cemetery at night, see the figure of a man with a long, leather coat wearing a hat. He would apparently always carry binoculars and a large flash light with him. They soon give the man a name: \"Grave Eye\". Apart from that no one actually knows who he is. A rare few dared to speak to him but they didn't get much out of him. \"None of your business. Go home safely\" , he said. Apparently he kept repeating that until you actually went home.\n\nAs always, the cemetery was closed at night, but not long after Grave Eye appeared during the evenings, they closed it during the day too. Apparently, some people thought the mystique surrounding the cemetery had something to do with a rich family supposedly lying there with pots full of gold and they brought their shovels.\n\nA week before Christmas, it was probably one of the most disturbing nights my otherwise quiet town has ever known.\n\nFrom what I heard afterward it started around 11 PM, people who lived within a few meters of the cemetery suddenly heard multiple loud and out-of-sync wailings. Multiple  residents came closer to its gates and started shouting on what was going on to the man in the long coat. He did respond in his usual way: \"None of your business. Go home safely.\" I remember a text from a friend explaining how messed up things were. By the time I arrived there, he and a whole crowd was standing in front of the gate. The screeching was still audible and went on almost continuously. I saw some who were shrouded in their dressing gowns awakened from sleep by the murmur. There was also already a police patrol keeping the crowd at bay. They requested people to return to their homes. The crowd refused, not until they knew what was going on. They asked the police about Grave Eye and if he was with them. The police acknowledged that. They kept repeating their message for the gathering to go back to their homes.\n\nLater that night, the mayor arrived. He struggled to pass by the crowd until he finally reached the cemetery gates. He and Grave Eye were whispering things in each other's ears. Until the mayor finally nodded and turned his head back to the crowd. He asked a police officer for his megaphone and pled the crowd to fulfil the police's request. He tried to comfort us by telling that the police suspect that these are just loiterers that want to scare people in the neighbourhood. He added:\n\n\"Nothing severe, people. Go home, sleep tight.\"\n\nIt was a cue for most to let the matter rest for now. Some were still worried, but the mayor briefly took the time to talk to them. I also spoke to him, but I couldn't get more information out of him than what he told others. He said some annoying fellas became an emerging problem in the town, but that the board was currently looking at how to address this.\n\nIn the evening, the next day, the local bar was packed with people. I've never seen anything like it. By entering the bar I heard a woman shouting: \"I've seen it. I've seen him: mayor Martin, together with deputy mayor Haze and two others. They were carrying children covered in black blankets.\" While the crowd continued discussing, smartphones were going around the café, with on it photos that had to serve as evidence. I have seen the pictures and although it looks like each of the four individuals are carrying something, it was really difficult what it exactly was. As it was also difficult to determine if two of the four individuals were indeed mayor Martin and deputy mayor Haze. I got my hands on another picture that was taken from a different perspective. On this I could see down below in the photo only the heads, though unrecognisable, but when I zoomed in I saw something orange-glowing, like a fire.\n\nThrough the people and the local press, the mayor was confronted with the images but outed them as being mass hysteria. He stuck to the story that it was problem youths who had run amok. He did add that the cemetery would not be cleared yet, nor did he give a date when it would be done in the future.\n\nMost folks don't know what to think about this story. They have the feeling that they are not allowed the truth.\n\nAs for me, I just hope our mayor isn't in some nasty business...",

My new place is a bit of a fixer upper but I’m making it cozy and peaceful. It started a few days after moving in, or at least that’s when I noticed it. A soft scratching noise. I figured it was just some rats running through the walls. I’m not a fan of most traps so naturally I got a harmless trap but the scratching continued as the cage set empty. I tried cheese, crackers, peanut butter everything.\n\n Sometimes I could see buttercup (my 5 year old rescue cat) staring at the wall almost seconds before the scratch happened which just furthered my belief that it was a rodent.  It kept getting louder tho. The scratching turned into scrapping. Instead of short bursts of scratching far apart it became longer and closer in time. Two weeks ago it got to the point it’s almost always happening when I’m home. \n\nIn an attempt to make the ever persistent noise stop I spent the little spare money I had on a pest control specialist. To my surprise he said there wasn’t any rodent issues, no dropping or food or anything. He told me there most have been some really big ones before tho maybe even a cat or rabbit based on how large the scraps in the walls were. Almost as soon as he left it began again. Needless to say I wasn’t staying the night. \n\nI started packing a bag for me and buttercup when it started. The shadows… in moments of silence I saw her..him..it? Whatever it is I didn’t think it could be human. It didn’t like it at first. It scurried from darkness to darkness avoiding the light as much as possible. Almost disappearing. I thought I was going crazy but couldn’t afford therapy. That was until my friend stayed over. After the first time I had my parents take my cat it didn’t feel safe having my baby there. When my friend looked at the hall halfway through the movie then at me like she’d seen a ghost I new it wasn’t just me. \n\nA week ago I saw it up close. She was curled up at the top of my closet looking almost like an imitation of spider man but she wasn’t like anyone I’ve seen before. She had bloodshot eyes with yellow where blue or brown would normally be, her hair was stingy but kept with two butterfly clips. She looked dehydrated and as though she hadn’t eaten in at least a year her skin almost falling off her with a green/gray tint.

Could’ve been minutes, could’ve been hours. When my legs finally gave out, I collapsed in the underbrush. I lay there panting like a fish out of water, trying to force myself back on my feet. \n\nI fell in and out of consciousness, shivering through the coldest hours of the night. I had no shelter, and nothing left in me to keep me going. I was exhausted and barely functioning. I managed to crawl a bit further, only to roll down the side of a hill.\n\nI ended up in a ditch next to a dirt road. That’s where I blacked out completely.\n\nNow, I’m not sure exactly what happened next. I have a vague memory of a barking dog, followed by frantic yelling. Someone checked my pulse, and I was carried into a vehicle. Possibly an ambulance. Someone kept talking to me, but I didn’t understand what they were saying. In my mind, all I could hear was Fred’s mad cackling. Falling unconscious, if anything, was a blessing. No more fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was just like closing and opening my eyes; no passage of time. When I opened my eyes, I thought I was back at John’s place. It wasn’t the first time I’d woken up with a white light stinging my eyes. Except this was a hospital, not John’s spare guest room. That, and John wasn’t there to meet me. God knows what happened to him.\n\nBut I wasn’t alone.\n\nThe man sitting across from me was in his early fifties. Dressed in a blue shirt with a black tie and black jeans, with a pocket protector and two types of pens. I got the impression he’d been sitting there for a while; he was tapping away at a small foldable laptop. Once I brought my eyes into focus, he looked up and adjusted his square glasses.\n\n“Good morning,” he said. “Can I get you something?”\n\n“No, uh… sorry. What… where am I?”\n\n“A worried passer-by called the police. The police brought you here. And then someone called us.”\n\n“Us?” I asked. “So you’re not with the police?”\n\n“No,” he smiled. “I’m your uncle’s former employer.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was put through a number of basic tests; starting with blood pressure, blood levels and my reflexes. At one point I could see the man in the blue shirt having a long conversation with one of the nurses, pointing at one of my charts and openly discussing my health. Who the hell were these people?\n\nFrom what I’d seen, Hatchet Pharmaceuticals, or Hatchet Investments, or Hatchet Biotechnica, were all different names for the same thing; a bunch of deep pockets who owned half the town. You could throw a rock at anything in Tomskog and you’d find their little blue sunflower logo firmly printed on it. Even there I could see it. A watermark on printer paper, a faded logo on the fire detectors. Hatchet Pharmaceuticals, or the “Hatchetmen”, were synonymous with the town itself.\n\nOnce my results came back, the man with the blue shirt sat down to speak to me in private.\n\n“I understand you’ve suffered a… blood poisoning, these past few months,” he said. “Why haven’t you sought medical attention?”\n\n“My uncle helped me,” I said. “He kept it in check.”\n\n“Are you sure? This is easily treatable. We can get it out of you in a few days.”\n\n“Wait… no transfusions or, uh… dialysis?”\n\nThe man just looked at me, dumbfounded. He stifled a chuckle and adjusted his glasses.\n\n“No, that, uh… that shouldn’t be necessary.”\n\nHe got out of his seat and held out a hand.\n\n“I’m Hank, by the way,” he said. “Hank Dudley.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty much everyone seemed to know Hank. They waved at him, greeted him by name, and asked him about his day. Turns out he had some sort of informal position at the hospital, but formally he was a liaison for the Hatchet group. He didn’t make a secret of it.\n\nI was about to fill out some forms for my release, but Hank just waved it off.\n\n“No need,” he said. “I get the sense that you value your privacy.”\n\nI nodded. At that point I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nHank followed me outside, and we got a moment to ourselves. He didn’t seem particularly forceful, and I had plenty of opportunity to just walk away. Still, I felt a bit indebted to him. He’d made sure I was treated well. Didn’t seem all that bad. \n\n“You got a place to stay?” Hank asked.\n\n“Not right now,” I admitted. “My uncle, he’s, uh… he’s out of town.”\n\n“We figured. Are you gonna be okay on your own?”\n\nI didn’t know. I didn’t know what to do, or where to go. The question was surprisingly hard to answer.\n\n“Look,” Hank said. “I know what’s going on. I know what you’re doing, and I know you’re in danger. I know some people who can keep an eye out and give you some space to breathe. Maybe give you a chance to just wait it all out.”\n\n“That’s, uh… awfully convenient,” I chuckled. “Sounds a bit too good to be true.”\n\n“Well, I know some people who’d love to talk to you,” he continued. “And that’s very valuable to us.”\n\nI thought about it. I figured that a conversation couldn’t hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHank pulled up in his car. Nothing particularly fancy; a modest mid-range Toyota. Overall I got the impression that Hank didn’t seem to be much different from the other people in town. It was easy to forget that he was one of the infamous “Hatchetmen”.\n\n“We have a facility not too far from here,” Hank said. “That should get you off the radar.”\n\n“When you say facility, you mean-“\n\n“Honestly, it is more like… containment. It sounds bad, but all there’s to it. We contain things. Both to keep them safe, and to keep things safe from them. If you need to get out of the spotlight for a while, it’s the perfect place to go.”\n\n“And I can leave at any time? No questions asked?”\n\n“Sure,” Hank shrugged. “But we might not be able to guarantee your safety.”\n\nHe sat up straight and adjusted his glasses.\n\n“Look,” he continued. “The Yearwalk is something we’ve wanted to study. The reason we haven’t is because it is extremely dangerous, and not many people undertake it willingly. That you’ve survived this long is interesting, and we’d love to see what happens if you go through with it.”\n\n“So I’m a bit of a, uh, curiosity.”\n\n“That’s a good word for it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe found our way out to an airstrip. This large patch of land lined with fences and barbed wire. Hank got us past a checkpoint, across the airstrip, and to a small set of office buildings. Nothing fancy, and nothing strange; just a bunch of eggshell white one-story buildings. If anything, it looked a little cheap. The road wasn’t even paved. Maybe it ought to just look good for the satellites.\n\nHank parked his car and showed me inside.\n\nThe interior was a completely different story. Fluorescent lights and concrete floors. Open spaces. Some sort of metal piping on the walls; some warm, some cold, some neutral. A sort of railing to allow people to feel their way forward in the dark.\n\nThere were colored lines across the floor, but no signs. If you didn’t know, you just didn’t know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut looking straight forward, something peculiar caught my eye. A cargo lift, and at least a dozen buttons. Twelve basement levels? How deep was this place? Hank noticed my side-eye.\n\n“This is just a surface-level building. It stretches pretty far underground.”\n\n“You’re not just gonna put me in some moldy basement, right? ‘Cause I wouldn’t want-“\n\n“No, no, no,” chuckled Hank. “Your main sleeping quarters would be on level two, but you’re free to come and go as you like.”\n\n“What about my phone? Internet access? You’re just gonna let me do whatever?”\n\n“Alright, let’s get real for a sec,” Hank interrupted. “From the moment you woke up, you’ve been heavily monitored. Everything you say, you do, and to some extent think, is actively being translated and analyzed. Some of the stuff we can do is going to be beyond your comprehension. And yes, our number one priority is to the safety of our staff and interests, but you are a part of that.”\n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder.\n\n“And as long as you’re not actively harming us, we’ll do everything in our power not just to keep you safe, but comfortable. If you play ball, you’re going to be fine. If you don’t, we got ways to protect ourselves.”\n\nI appreciated it. Someone just talking to me like a real person, showing me their cards. Even so, there was that tinge of threat in ‘protect ourselves’ that didn’t sit quite right with me. But for the time being, I just nodded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let’s talk about my time with Hatchet.\n\nThat set of buildings were just one of ten connected sites. Underground tunnels stretched for miles underneath, and the lower levels were a complete mystery. This was the facility closest to Tomskog, but there were facilities that stretched all the way to the state line. This place had been built under the guise of bomb shelters back in the 40’s, reinforced during the cold war, and kept modernized and supplied for years.\n\nThe thing about Hatchet is that while most of their income comes from patents and pharmaceuticals, they have a surprisingly large general manufacturing industry. Some of it is overseas, but mostly of it is wholly domestic. They make everything from paper towels to wall paneling. They got subsidiaries for everything, and the paper trail goes far deeper than twelve levels.\n\nThe second floor, at least at this part of the facility, was employee housing.\n\nFour rooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen. In lieu of windows, there were large ambient light screens plastered on the walls, simulating a day and night cycle. White wooden wall panels, rubber flooring and solid concrete ceiling. Not the homiest kind of feeling; it was more like living in a fancy basement. They were also adamant about fire safety; keeping fire detectors, sprinklers, and extinguishers in every room.\n\nTemperature-controlled shower and bathtub, fully stocked kitchen with a digital assistant for ordering groceries. Living room, bedroom, a small office, and a storage room. The place was immaculate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is easy to get into a routine when you’re feeling comfortable, and Hank put me at ease. I took up jogging around the airstrip once per day. I got back online in the office. Just getting to sit down and check on all my socials was a strange feeling after all this time barely scraping by. Sure, I was being monitored, but I didn’t get the sense that it was nefarious.\n\nHank would drop by every other day. Sometimes on his own, sometimes with people. He’d also get me whatever groceries I ordered; bringing it all in brandless containers in a plain paper bag. Sometimes it’d be so fresh that the edges of the plastic were still warm from the cutter.\n\nAnd we’d talk. Recorded interviews about everything I’d experienced over these past few months.\n\nI told them everything. Everything from the uncomfortable snake-like creature that’d called me ‘little wheat’ to Fred. They took intense notes, asked a lot of follow-up questions and asked me to go into vivid detail. Skin textures, smells, intonations in voices. Everything that could be broken down into pieces and analyzed.\n\nI got the impression that Hank was just a ‘face’. The real people working these facilities were practical people. Even the interviewers talking to me were laser-focused, prepared, and constantly asked me to clarify things. When I couldn’t, they asked me to draw things, use metaphors, or just focus on my personal experience. Whatever kind of information they could wring out of me, like a wet towel, they did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t have a lot of bad things to say about my time at Hatchet. They were courteous, and no one stopped me from just coming and going as I pleased. Hell, Hank gave me a ride into town on a few occasions. I was allowed to make any phone call I wanted, talk to anyone, and pretty much do whatever. Still, I had that feeling that if I stepped over the line, the consequences would be dire.\n\nBut I had no intention of doing so. Why would I?\n\nAs July crossed into August, I didn’t mind staying there. The questioning was down from once a day to once a week, but they were still going to keep me around. These were people who were in-the-know. They knew of the entities I described. They didn’t bat an eye about headless bodies or alternate dimensions. If anything, it seemed to excite them.\n\nI could see myself sticking around. At least until the end of the year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne morning, as I went to take a jog around the airstrip, the weather had turned into a downpour. Still, I had to get some fresh air. I left my phone behind and decided I’d just be out for a little while. I love being out in the rain anyway.\n\nSo I took the cargo lift, walked through the corridor, and out the front door. I was immediately hit by a gust of wind, and it really was pouring outside.\n\nIt struck me as a bit strange that I hadn’t seen any others. Most of the time there were people rushing up and down the cargo lift, but so far I hadn’t seen anyone. A lot of people worked remotely, but this was… odd. Quiet.\n\nAnd it got even odder as I stepped outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see at least a dozen people standing on the airstrip in the middle of the downpour. I recognized some of them from the nearby area. Interviewers, security guards, truck drivers, maintenance workers, electricians. But it was the person I didn’t recognize that stood out to me the most.\n\nShe was a young woman with a black pixie haircut, and a gray hoodie long enough to reach her knees. A black mascara ran from the corner of her eyes, as she looked straight up into the dark clouds. The others seemed to do the same; keeping their mouths wide open to gather up the rain. Even from 50 feet, I could see that they didn’t blink. Raindrops just kept tapping away at their open eyes.\n\nMy phone beeped. Something inconsequential; an update or a notification. Maybe a new post by a YouTuber.\n\nEither way, it turned heads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started with just one of them. One of the truck drivers. He turned his head my way, without looking down from the sky. It was as if his head and body moved independently of one another. He took a fumbling step towards me, careful not to spill the rainwater he’d collected in his mouth. Moments later, the others followed suit.\n\nThen, in unison, they started running.\n\nHaphazardly throwing themselves to the wind, forcing their bodies forward with complete abandon. Arms flailing, body and neck twisting and turning like they were being dragged forward. All I heard from them were these uncomfortable gurgling sounds, as the rainwater reached all the way into their lungs.\n\nI ran back inside, trying my best to lock the door. I didn’t have any door codes, and the panel made little sense to me. I abandoned the idea and just ran back towards the cargo lift.\n\nI pressed the “2” button over and over, hoping against hope that I’d been quick enough. I could hear the front door sliding open, and wet feet smacking against the floor. They were inside; looking for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the cargo lift moved, and I went down. I checked my phone. I usually had coverage, even underground. One of the many oddities of the Hatchet site.\n\nI tried calling Hank, but I got nothing. I tried to call the guard at the front gate, but got nothing. Finally, as I just tried calling the police, my phone disconnected completely. Seemed that the filters they’d put in were still in effect.\n\nBut hey, at least I was safe.\n\nThen the doors opened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out, there’s a problem with having sprinklers installed in every corridor; especially if there’s something wrong with the water.\n\nI looked down the level 2 corridor, only to see the sprinklers going wild. The lights had turned to an emergency red. Still, there was no alarm. No blaring siren. Just a low electric hum as the lights struggled to go on and off, on and off, on and off.\n\nIt was hard to see, but the water was slightly darker than usual. There was a viscosity to it, making it clump and pool. I could see it dripping out of the sprinklers, or clogging them completely in places.\n\nI tried to go lower, but the lift allowed me only two spaces. Level 2, or topside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pressed myself against the back of the cargo lift, trying to remember to breathe. I thought this place would be safe. The world outside was where the dangers lurked, this place was supposed to be a sanctuary. If a group like Hatchet can’t keep things straight, who the hell can?\n\nI could hear shuffling movement further in. I wasn’t alone, and no one seemed in a hurry to leave. Which, in itself, was worrying.\n\nI hid around the corner of the cargo lift and just listened. I could hear shuffling feet, gargling, and wet fabric flapping back and forth. I didn’t need to look to know; whatever was happening up there was happening down here as well. I held my breath, waiting for whoever roamed the halls to pass by.\n\nI had to shield myself from the sprinklers. Whatever this was came from the water. I took off my shirt and wrapped it around my face like a mask. I couldn’t see, but if I could just make it into my room, I could take shelter and get my bearings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily, there were these pipes along the wall. I had thought about them a lot, and I knew my room was on the left side; following a cold pipe with a round mark on it. \n\nI tried to listen more than to look. I felt the cold water run over me, and I could hear shuffling footsteps down the connecting hallways. Every now and then I could hear a gargle over the pouring water, and I’d stop dead in my tracks.\n\nEventually, I made my way back to my room. I hurried through the door, closed it behind me, and almost wept out of relief. The sprinklers here were turned off. I could breathe for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tore the my shirt off. Even here, there were red emergency lights blinking. My phone was completely offline, same for the desktop computer in my office. I was stuck down here, there was no way I could get out topside. I had to find another way out.\n\nThere were several exits, that much I knew. It could be miles of tunnels between them, but they were there. I didn’t have an idea just how far this had spread, but whatever containment they’d worked on had obviously failed. I didn’t care much for how, or why.\n\nI packed a bag. Bottled water, some snacks, two fresh sets of clothes. A charger for my phone. But I didn’t know what to do against the water.\n\nI went through the kitchen two times, only stopping once when I heard a noise outside. My heart jumped up in my throat. I’m not claustrophobe, but if anything would make me one it’d be being stuck down there in the flowing water.\n\nUsing a baseball cap with the blue sunflower logo, I wrapped my head in layers of cellophane. I stuffed a water bottle with dish towels, using it as a sort of makeshift filter. I had no idea if this thing was airborne or not, but I wasn’t taking any chances. I’d come too far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I considered a weapon. A kitchen knife would be the obvious choice, but those things can get slippery. I needed something with a bit more power. I finally settled on prying off a metal leg from the kitchen table. It was about as long as my arm, and sturdy as all hell. At the very least I could push them away with it.\n\nI put on my jacket, and a took a deep breath.\n\nI could’ve used a comforting voice then. John telling me he knew what was going on, and how to fix it. Evan watching my back, tearing monsters to pieces if necessary. I didn’t know what those things outside were, and what they were doing to people. But whatever it was, it was bad.\n\nI stepped back into the hallway, prepared for a long walk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sprinklers were still going strong. Some of the red lights were dying, leaving only a handful of them blinking with various intensity. Emergency lights are meant to last for hours; something was wrong.\n\nAt first, I wasn’t shocked to see another person in the hallway. It took me a moment to recognize her. The black pixie haircut. The long gray hoodie. The running mascara. Black water dropped out of the edges of her mouth, as her neck swiveled back and forth like a bobblehead.\n\nFor a moment, we just looked at one another. She looked tired. Her sunken brown eyes and colorless lips spoke volumes. She was shivering, cold, and barely standing up.\n\nAnd yet, she had no trouble charging straight at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wasn’t alone. At least a dozen people, scrambling to get past her, started chasing me down the hallway. I’d followed this hallway the other way once, but everything looked different in the dark. I tried to keep track of the various colors and pipes, but I got the lines mixed up. Blue and green doesn’t look that different in dark red.\n\nI could hear them slipping and climbing over one another. Wet skin slapping against rubber and concrete, little moans and groans as their bodies struggled to push the water out.\n\nI turned left, only to run straight into one of them. An older man, some kind of maintenance worker. Still holding his toolbox, staring straight up at the sprinklers; letting the dark water fill his open mouth.\n\nI bumped into him, seeing water spill over from the corner of his mouth. He turned his head down and let the water set in his cheeks, staring at me with bloodshot eyes.\n\nI could barely see through the cellophane. The water and the reflection from the red lights made it difficult. But I’ll never forget those bloodshot eyes. There was no recognition of one person to another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCold fingers wrapped around my arms, but I just put my table leg to his torso and pushed. It was surprisingly effective, forcing him back and sending him sprawling to the floor. Footsteps were approaching, I had to keep going. He hurried to get to me, spilling black water on the floor. He got as far as grazing my shoes with his fingertips before I was gone.\n\nI hurried down the hallway, only stopping occasionally to catch my breath and to make sure I wasn’t running into something worse. Finally, I ended up in a long tunnel. Wide enough for two trucks to pass one another; this place was enormous. Probably some kind of cold war infrastructure project.\n\nThere were no sprinklers here, but there were plenty of people. Most of them were standing with their heads turned up, as to not spill any of the water from their mouths. So as long as I kept myself low and quiet, they couldn’t see me. Still, as little as a bump could send them off into a rage.\n\nCrawling on all fours, I kept going forward. I had trouble breathing through my makeshift filter, and the cellophane made crinkling noises. I had to take it off so they couldn’t hear me. I just had to hope this wasn’t widespread enough to catch me off guard down the line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard some of them shift and turn. One leaned down to grab my legs, only to stop once the water in his mouth started spilling over. He groaned in pain, frustrated not to catch me. They were out of their element, but it was clear that they were not done pursuing me. If anything, they still knew perfectly well that I was there. Some of them were slowly moving my way, following me down the vast tunnel.\n\nThen the emergency lights went dark.\n\nI had to move forward in complete darkness, occasionally bumping into something. Sometimes a person, other times a wall, or a crate. Gargles and movement in the dark. Fingers grasping at me. Explosive movement, like a frightened dog, at every turn.\n\nThere had to be a light somewhere. There had to be an end of the tunnel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA notification on my phone.\n\nGoddamn it, I was sure I’d turned it off.\n\nGod, fucking, damnit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pulled it up and put on a flashlight. I could see dozens of them, closing their mouths, and staring right at me. Bloodshot eyes reflecting in the pale cellphone light.\n\nThey were coming for me with everything they got.\n\nI burst into a sprint, tackling a man to get past. My backpack was grabbed by an older woman, and I just let her have it. I tore myself free from grasping fingers and just kept going. Fingernails taking every opportunity to dig into my skin. Gargles and stifled gag reflexes echoed down the tunnel, giving me no chance to stop.\n\nFaces covered in black water passed me by, reflecting off my cellphone flashligt. Hands outstretched, reaching for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, there was a green shine.\n\nNot at the end of a tunnel, but by a small door on the left; a service entrance. I beelined for it, almost slipping on the corner of a plastic tarp. Catching myself by the door I took one look back, only to see this sea of people still coming for me. A young woman with a black pixie hairchut, and a long gray hoodie, standing at the very front.\n\nI yanked the door open and just kept running. My lungs were burning. Hadn’t it been for my daily jogging routine, I’d be dead.\n\nI noticed the lights seemingly guiding me forward. A light showing me to turn left. To stop. To hurry. Intense blinking or sudden darkness, it was all communicative. Someone was watching, helping me get out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made it all the way to another cargo lift. A smaller one, mainly used for repairs and maintenance staff. Then again, there was no way to tell how long I’d been running. I just pressed the button for the surface and sank down at the back of the elevator, catching my breath.\n\nA drop of water hit my eye.\n\nI freaked out, screaming and tearing at my face to get it out.\n\nIt took me a few seconds to realize I was fine; it was just condensation. Just water; that was all there was to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as the doors opened, I saw Hank Dudley. This time with a gun pointed at me. The friendliness in his face had faded.\n\n“Get up,” he scowled. “On your feet.”\n\n“Hank?” I said. “What are you-“\n\nHe smacked me across the face with his gun. In my confusion, he grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me along; pushing me in front of him.\n\n“This was the plan, huh?” he chuckled. “You people. You *fucking* people.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was taken outside. It looked like an administration building for some sort of logging site. A dirt road stretched far into the pine woods, and I could taste sawdust in the air; even after the rain. The rain had stopped, luckily.\n\nNot so luckily, Hank pushed me forward with the butt of his gun. I fell to my knees, feeling the barrel push against the back of my head.\n\nMaybe *this* was it. Maybe it wouldn’t be the strange and unnatural taking me out.\n\nMaybe it’d be just an old-fashioned all-American handgun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We were going to take care of you,” Hank said. “We were dealing with this together. And this is what you do?”\n\n“I-I don’t know! What’d I do?!”\n\n“I’m not a fucking *idiot*, Digman!”\n\nA kick to my back. I fell forward and rolled over, so I could face my attacker. Hank had his gun pointed straight at me.\n\n“Your fucking family is a *menace*. If Galapagos had even *hinted* at you needing a purge, you’d be fucking *dust* in the fucking ***wind.*** I’d be looking at your fucking face in an *ashtray*!”\n\nHe kicked me, breaking something in my stomach.\n\n“How did you get past the security checkpoints?!” he screamed. “How did you get past the encryption?! You can barely fucking type!”\n\n“I do… okay,” I groaned. “J-just… I didn’t-“\n\n“Funny!” he chuckled, kicking me again, and again. “Funny! So funny!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tasted blood. There was a click.\n\nThen nothing.\n\nFor a moment, I thought I might be dead. But there was no pain, there was nothing. Not even a blast. In fact, the gun didn’t seem to fire at all.\n\nHank kept clicking, over and over. Nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHanks gun had something called a biometric safety trigger. Just a simple RFID-identifier, made to ensure that only the right person could fire the gun. I had no idea about this at the time, but it seemed that it didn’t want to work all of a sudden. Hank threw his gun to the side, picking up my table leg.\n\n“Digman,” he growled. “You… you *fucking*\\-“\n\nThen, a gunshot. This time, not aimed at me.\n\nI covered my ears as another three rounds rang out. Hank Dudley collapsed next to me, joining me in the dirt. His mouth wide open, and his eyes wild. A dead man catching the last drops of rainwater on his tongue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn outstretched hand pulled me back to my feet, as a pair of arms wrapped around me.\n\nI’d recognize Uncle John and his strange hair anywhere.\n\n“Are you okay?” John asked, stroking my hair. “Did they hurt you?”\n\n“You… you did this?”\n\n“Well, yeah,” John shrugged. “Containment doesn’t breach itself.”\n\n“You did this. You killed people.”\n\nJohn pulled back, looking me in the eyes. We had the same baseball cap.\n\n“I know it looks bad,” he said. “But they had no intention of ever letting you go.”\n\nSomewhere in the distance, there was a siren.\n\n“There’s a reason I left these people,” John continued. “And right now, you just have to trust me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd once again, I grabbed his outstretched hand.",

        "text": "The road was desolate and dark, the void being broken up by streetlamps that resembled stars. I kept my head down as I walked on the uneven pavement, desperate not to make eye contact with the moon. I couldn't see the face it was making at me, but I could feel it. The face was angry, scowling at my incompetence. I felt 3 taps on my shoulder and turned around to see a man holding a cardboard sign that said “I have no teeth.” His torso and limbs were pencil thin, only existing to bear the weight of hanging rags. \n\n“Spare change?” he asked   \n“Sure!” \n\nHe dropped to the floor and his head cracked open like an egg as it hit the concrete. I knelt down at the mushy mass of flesh and frowned. \n\n“What about the change”\n\nThe gray matter resting in his fractured skull began the decomposition process. 2 days passed and a puddle of rot took its place, in the center was a silver dollar.\n\n“Thanks” I pocketed the money, then continued my walk down the street.\n\nThe street lamps were a color, but I'm not sure which one. A street lamp can be any color, and who am I to judge? Some people like to go around saying that things are aqua blue and magenta, but when I ask them what it means they don't know how to answer. The balls on people! What I did know however, was how this made me feel. And to be honest it pissed me off.  \n\n“Hypocritical” said the man in rags\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why criticize others for a practice you do yourself? How is assuming the color of the streetlamps any worse than assuming the face of the moon? At Least they took the time to look” \n\n“Whatever, didn’t you die or something?”\n\n“Yes, but that was before. did you know that you’re smoking?”\n\nI looked to the left and there it was, a hand (that was presumably mine) holding a cigarette, moths drifting in the place of smoke\n\n“Yes I did.”\n\n“And you’re just ok with that?” \n\n“Yes, yes I am. By the way do you actually have no teeth?”\n\nHe smiled in response, a toothless set of gums glistening off the moonlight. \n\nFor the second time, I continued my walk. This time looking up. The moon was frowning. She wasn’t mad, just disappointed. \n\nI turned left and entered the nicest restaurant in town, waffle house. Sitting down, I placed my silver dollar on the table and asked for another pack of cigarettes. There wasn’t anyone there to serve me but I trusted the reliability of waffle house. on my right sat no-one and on my left was the stranger in rags. His impossibly thin fingers fidgeted with themselves, the sound of clicking bones resembling a geiger-counter. The sign was leaning against his stool, this time with new writing that spelled out *do not give me cigarettes* \n\n“Uhh hey man about earlier. Let me try one of those cigarettes”\n\n“What, why? I thought you didn’t approve of them”\n\n“Truth is, i never had one”\n\n“I don't know. What about your sign?”\n\n“Don’t worry about that, just let me try one”\n\n“I think you should do it” pitched in no-one.\n\nReluctantly, I handed the stranger a cigarette. He picked it up and turned it in front of his face, examining every angle of the paper tube and its contents. Eventually he popped it into his mouth and started to chew in pure ecstasy, closing his eyes as he licked his cracked, bleeding lips.  After swallowing, his face split open in what resembled a smile. The bodies of twitching moths lodged between his teeth. \n\n“Thanks kid i really appreciate that”\n\n“Im 43” \n\nHe got up and walked towards the exit, as he turned around I saw two spots on his back bulge and pulsate. Not wanting to be rude, I said nothing. \n\nI finished the food on my plate, spit out the filters and stretched as I got out of my seat. \n\nI walked out and took the route home. an anxiety inducing shiver ran up my spine and tapped the back of my skull, screaming in my ear to run. I looked up and all the street lamps were white, that is, if white was a color to begin with.\n\n“Hypocritical, don't you think?”\n\n“god fucking dammit what do you want from me” i turned around to see the stranger, just as thin but somehow wildly different. His eyes now a pair of bulbous mosaics.  \n\n“Look man, just let me get a few more cigarettes. that's all i want and i \n\nyou alone i promise. I have no reason to hurt you and I know you have so just give it to me. Besides, I'm the one who paid for the pack.” \n\n“Ok if i give you one more cigarette you’ll leave me alone right”\n\n“No man i want the whole pack, you don't even need it man you got bad lungs. I can smell it on ya.”\n\n“One, take it or leave it.” i didn’t actually think he’d satisfied with the deal, but i needed a way to get him off of my back\n\n“Yeah man. And hey look sorry about being so pushy earlier. Just pop one out of the pack and hand it to me. I'll leave you alone man I promise.”\n\n“Ok just this one” i said, fully knowing one (or ten thousand for that matter) could never be enough. Forcing my entire will to my hands in hopes to keep them still. My right hand pushed back denim folds and entered my pocket. My fingers dug deeper until they found themselves wrapped around a small cardboard box. My forearm extracted the pack and slowly pried open the lid. My hands, starting to lose their nerve, shook as it plucked and pulled at a carefully selected paper tube.\n\n“Here man, one cig, just like we agreed on”\n\nHe snatched it from my hands and shoved it into his mouth. Cocoons hung from the roof of his mouth replacing what were once teeth and crushed it in pure euphoria. I picked up my pace and walked as fast as i could without running, praying i don't draw it’s attention. The sound of snapping bone pierced my ears, startling me as I dropped the box of cigarettes and looked back. He was already in front of me, devouring the spilled tobacco and bug wings littering the pavement. I stood petrified in horror as the thin white line that spoke cracked open to reveal 87 human teeth and a bright red tongue that protruded from the demon's mouth while dancing through the air. Its flesh pulsated and twitched, almost as though its very existence was straining. The thing stood up with an angular hunch, gangrenous and pain striking limbs twitching in anxiety. \n\nIt charged on all 4 limbs, but 4 became six as the creature grew a pair of spotted brown wings. The thing took flight and followed me into my home. The place was desolate except for the sound of our pursuit. Crashing furniture and heavy panting mixed with screams. \n\nI looked back to see 143 human teeth lodged into the creatures gaping maw. The things tongue lolled out, drool splattering the carpet floor as we approached closer to my room. The sound of crashing feet and hot breath grew closer. But after entering my room, I slammed and locked the door behind me, then approached the blinds. I looked down and the streetlamps weren’t a color at all, this unsettled, but I found it peaceful in a way. Terrified of the punishment to come, I looked up and saw the moon, smiling with 32 human teeth.",

        "text": "[Part 2 (file-003)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103zkhu/jesse_pt_2/)\n\n//NOTICE: This file is confidential information. Any unauthorized viewing or sharing of this document is strictly prohibited, and will result in severe consequences.//\n\nThe following is the third file I retrieved from the government archive. It contains three things. The first is a case report written by someone who I will refer to as ‘Jane’. She apparently worked in a facility which housed the mentally unstable. I could not retrieve File-002, along with quite a few others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFile-004\n\nCASE REPORT - Patient 888 “Jesse” \n\nDr. \\[//EXPUNGED DATA//\\] writing.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nPatient was experiencing epileptic convulsions for a while, but recently they have stopped.\n\nPatient did not talk until very recently, the day after the epileptic convulsions stopped.\n\nPatient demonstrates self-harming behavior when not restrained.\n\nPatient seems to have trouble walking on her own.\n\nPatient begins to thrash wildly when touched.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPatient was found in a near-catatonic state in her home, after being wanted for questioning in the killing of the Becketts. She was covered in blood and was lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling. She was unresponsive.\n\nWe took ‘Jesse’ in on \\[//EXPUNGED DATA//\\], and have held her here for \\[//EXPUNGED DATA//\\]. She immediately displayed some of the symptoms I have listed above, such as thrashing when touched, trouble walking, and epileptic convulsions.\n\nWe did multiple tests to make sure that the convulsions were not going to harm her. The results came back: they were not affecting her mental state, only her physical state, and only occasionally.\n\nAt first, the patient did not demonstrate any behavior pointing to the fact that she might want to harm herself. Once she came out of the catatonic state she was in, which was only about a month after we got her, she did very little. In fact, we didn’t even have to restrain her until much more recently. \n\nShe even spoke for a long period of time. Not much, but when she did speak, it was nonsense.\n\nIn addition to this, whenever the Becketts were mentioned, she began crying. She didn’t answer any questions, she just cried.\n\nLast month, out of nowhere, she began acting aggressively toward the staff and towards herself. We put her under restraints, and had minimal contact with her. In addition, at the same time this happened, she stopped talking completely. She did not respond when the Becketts' names were mentioned. Her convulsions got worse, to the point where we had to have her temporarily transferred to a hospital and then back.\n\nCURRENT\n\nPatient’s state has deteriorated greatly. We expect her to only live for a few more days. Her seizures have become constant. Her convulsions are becoming more and more violent. Her tendencies have gotten to the point where if she sees another person, she will thrash wildly in an attempt to harm them, and if she cannot, she will attempt to harm herself.\n\nADDENDUM \n\nDr. Marcus Vigenere writing.\n\nYesterday, Jesse escaped her cell. Three members of the staff were found dead, their corpses twisted in ways indicating the work of either a maniac or an expert. She then proceeded to walk out of the building uninterrupted. Many staff members are under interrogation for letting her walk free.\n\nJesse has yet to be located.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis file is troubling. The Addendum at the end looks to be added a few days after the rest of the report, as well as it being written by a different person. I can only assume that the worst happened to Jane.\n\nThe second object in File-004 is a flash drive with an audio file, titled jesse.mp3, on it. I can not attach the file itself, so I will do my best to describe what is on it here.\n\nThe recording opens with complete silence, and the white noise of a bad quality recording. Then, a male voice speaks. Throughout it talking, it gets closer and farther from the device being used to record. The voice breaks quite a bit, and is breathing hard. Occasionally, it sobs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I need help. Help. Help, please. I hope this is recording.”\n\nThere is a banging as the recording device drops. There are slow, heavy footsteps in the distance, above wherever the device is. They move to the side, then there is the distant sound of a door slowly creaking open. The footsteps creak onto what sounds like stairs.\n\nThere’s a shuffling sound as the person on the recording grabs the camera and hides.\n\nThen there is another voice, yelling in the background of the recording.\n\n“Hello? Mr. Beckett?”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Mr. Beckett, are you here? It’s doctor Lam- doctor Vigenere. I’m here to help you,”\n\nStill silence.\n\nAfter a second, the footsteps ascend the staircase and fade out of the house. The voice begins talking again after a few seconds.\n\n“He is not what he seems to be.”\n\nThen the recording cuts out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe it is safe to assume that the same Marcus Vigenere who wrote the Addendum to the case report above is the one who was in this person’s home. But why was he there? And why was the person in the home seemingly scared of him? I don’t know this yet.\n\nHowever, the user JenGosling managed to decipher the message in my previous post. Apparently, Vigenere is not his real last name. It is Lamfort. Why would he hide his real name? I don’t know this either.\n\nI also do not know the identity of the person speaking on the recording. The quality is too bad to identify them.\n\nI also found the following encrypted into the file itself. It is not the same cipher as in the last post. I have not as of yet managed to decipher this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRicg-002\n\nXj. Yaieok Xadhijf wiknazg.\n\nUt. Wjqee, vbw potvij ihf yuk ioimcfs wzvb Bqsjg ufp wyq qjatv vbw oajg lwboiv if tei, yuk wicnyv foucs, sxoei qafh kyi gfhvt mlmfw oyeneiu. Dwesv gmumpvf nzq frecdutp, chv us eqq oto bpioe wyglw.

Jjy oulc mcdx yfw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am still confused, but I know even more about who this ‘Jesse’ the files are referring to might be, and what she is capable of. And it scares me.\n\nOh! That reminds me. On my last post, a user named der\\_Retter commented that they were not Jesse, or a stranger, but a ‘concerned observer’. They asked me to message them. I shall do that right after I finish writing this. Hopefully, they can help me.\n\nSincerely, \n\nJulius Klein",

        "text": "[Part 1 - My childhood town isn't on any map.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zu2umb/my_childhood_town_isnt_on_any_map/)\n\nA whisper in the wind. That is what Sonder is to many people, and what it has slowly become to me. I found myself, like many others, becoming unaware of its existence at all.\n\nA small town on the edge of England, forgotten as fast as it was built. It isn't on any map, and you won't find it by exploring. A town older than most, smaller than most, and lonelier than most. I got out 10 years ago. But it seems it hasn't left me.\n\nThe Screamsingers have plagued my mind since the day I left. I'll never forget what they took from me, or the part of me I left behind in Sonder. Partly because Sonder has come back to haunt me. On New Year's Eve, the Screamsingers became more than a memory. They found me.\n\nI work in a small office building. 3 floors, and I work on the top floor, with a few others in my room. I've been working there for about 6 months. One of the best things is the flexible working arrangements they offer. You can do the usual Monday-Friday work week if you'd like. Or, you can work Sunday-Thursday. I opted for the latter.\n\nThe night before New Year's Eve, I was awoken by a familiar sound washing over the cold streets outside. An enchanting whistle to some, but to those with the same trauma as me, it was a blood-curdling shriek.\n\nI got up and opened my bedroom window. The sound poured in, as if I had invited this presence into my home. I stood there, not quite knowing how to feel. As terrified as I was, hearing this siren of the night, something about it was calming. It was as if I was back in my childhood home. A kind of nostalgic horror.\n\nPerhaps this nostalgia is why I was so quick to dismiss this event as nothing more than a dream. Or, perhaps I just didn't want to accept the true nature of it all. Whatever the reason, it's something I regret. While this may be a nightmare, it most certainly was not a dream.\n\nI walked to work the next morning, on New Year's Eve. The streets seemed quieter than normal. I almost felt like I was back in Sonder again - Everything was so peaceful. As I walked into the office building, the door chimed as it always does. *ding ding*\n\nYou have to slam the door shut for it to catch again. It's a bit broken, and if you don't do this, it'll keep blowing open in the wind, playing that chime over and over.\n\nThe only other person in the office that day was Davide - He works in the same room as me. Everyone else had booked the day off, or just didn't work Sundays. We ended up chatting a lot, and not getting a lot of work done. He was raised in a city, and loves hearing stories about the rural seaside town of Sonder. I only tell him the good memories.\n\nThe town was on my mind a lot, and I took a look online again, to see if it was on any maps yet. I haven't looked since I left. Sure enough, nothing. Untraceable, unfindable. I found a few mentions of the town here and there, but that's it. Just a fleeting thought, spoken about fewer and fewer as time goes on.\n\nI spent the last hour of that work day looking for Sonder. Until it found me.\n\n4:46pm. 14 minutes until we would have left. 14 minutes until we would get to go home and celebrate the new year with our families. That's exactly when we heard the chime again.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nBut the door didn't shut. So, we assumed our boss had come in to check on us, since he's often forgetful. We quickly sat up straight and acted as though we had been working all day.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nWe couldn't hear anybody walking upstairs yet. I thought perhaps it wasn't our boss. But then, who else would it be? Perhaps another co-worker had left something in the office and had come to collect it? Or, maybe it was our boss, and he was here to lock up when we leave, and not to check on us.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe stupid door would not shut up. Even our boss wouldn't leave it this long. Once he realises it keeps playing the chime, he goes to shut it properly. At this point, I thought maybe a delivery driver dropped a package in and left. It would've explained the silence downstairs. But the silence broke quickly enough for this thought to be dismissed.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nFootsteps, creaking up the stairs. Except, they didn't have the right sound to them. They were heavy, yet slow. They also didn't have the right pattern to them. It was a footstep, then 2 quick footsteps, then none, then 3 quick footsteps, then a slow one. They felt less like feet, and more like an omnipresent \"bang\" getting closer.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nMe and Davide looked at each other. I wasn't scared, and he didn't look to be, either. We were just both confused and uneased. The constant chime; the irregular thuds; the silence that they both pierced through. None of them created a feeling of contentment.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe thuds were loud now, as the final few steps creaked. We were both peering out the door, looking at the stairs to our floor. Waiting. Hoping to see our boss' head, or a co-worker, or anybody we recognised. But as a figure slowly emerged up the stairs, I realised it was one I knew all too well.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nAs the grey, skinny, morphing creature slowly became visible, my mind raced back to that day in the woods. The day I saw a figure on the rock. Only this time, I had nowhere to run. I was sat there, motionless, at my desk.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe chimes still echoed up the building, as the creature slowed down. It stood out in the open room, looking at us. I don't know whether Davide could see it, or whether he saw nothing, much like my brother. But either way, there we were, both frozen.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe lights went out. After being sat in front of a monitor for so long, my eyes were not used to this. A deepest of darks had encased me, and shrouded the room. Silence filled the air, as the Screamsinger seemed to stop making noises entirely. But I knew it wasn't gone. It was still there as I tried my hardest to make as little noise as possible.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nThe darkness felt thick. Like a blanket. It was as if I could reach out and grab it. Of course, the truth was quite the opposite - Anything could have reached out and grabbed me. I realised at this moment that I could hear something else: My heartbeat. All I could think about was my brother. Jacob was taken from me 10 years ago, and this thing was responsible.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nA creak in the floorboards. Something was moving. Was it the creature? Was it Davide? It doesn't matter what it was. Because the next thing I heard was a scream. Not the tune-like call of a Screamsinger, but the pain-filled cry of a man. It had gotten Davide, and it **wanted** me to hear - I know well from my time in Sonder that these things can silently take lives. It had chosen, purposely, with clear intent, to not force silence on this kill. It wanted to torture me, to remind me. It didn't plan to have me dead - It planned to have me terrified.\n\n*ding ding*\n\nI could hear nothing but dripping. A pitter-patter similar to the rain hitting your window. The lights returned, and the Screamsinger was gone, along with Davide. His chair was soaked with blood, as a puddle of it was growing on the floor below. I sat there just staring at this chair. I think I felt so scared that I was almost numb to the feeling of it at all. I just sat there. I wasn't thinking, I wasn't moving, I was just sitting.\n\nIt took me too long to realise this, but the chair was contorting. The number of legs on it kept changing - 2, then 3, then 1, then 4. I don't know if I was seeing things. I would assume I was if it weren't for what I had witnessed just seconds before. But a morphing chair leaves more questions than it presents answers. By the time the police arrived, the chair was back to normal. If you consider a blood-soaked chair to be normal.\n\nI have no doubt they were called in from the scream. They took me to the station and questioned me, of course. I told them everything except for what I had seen. They'd call me crazy, so, I told them that the power was cut and I couldn't see what was happening, I just heard it all. I was being held for a few days, but was released last night. They confirmed that the power did go out briefly in the area, and suspected that it had been tampered with intentionally. I don't know if they've checked CCTV, and I'm not sure what it would've even captured. I just know that I'm no longer the top suspect, although I would assume they're still keeping a close eye on me.\n\nDavide was a good man, and the first life I know of to be claimed by the Screamsingers outside of Sonder. But I keep thinking, what if there have been more? What if he isn't the first? A thought even more worrying - Will he be the last?\n\nThe Screamsingers are now out and free. So many questions, and I suspect all the answers lay within Sonder.\n\nPerhaps it's time I go back.",

        "text": " It all started on an average Monday morning in a small town I lived in called Harwich. I always hated Mondays, mostly because of school, but that day was the start of something much worse. \n\nIt didn’t help that it was my last year of school, so I had to spend most of my days learning for my final exams, which will happen a few months later. So overall, it was a pretty stressful year.\n\nI was in the catering, having breakfast with my classmate, Josh, trying to prepare for our next class. He was an 18-year-old guy, just like me, with short, messy brown hair and piercing green eyes. He stood at about average height and had a lean, athletic build from playing on his high school's soccer team. Despite being a bit of a slacker and not always putting in the most effort, Josh was a decent student.\n\nI looked back as another classmate entered the catering. Samantha was another 18-year-old with long, dark hair that fell in soft curls down her back. She had brown eyes that seemed to take in everything around her and a quiet, thoughtful demeanor. \n\nDespite being quiet and generally preferring to keep to herself, Samantha was an excellent student with straight A's and a passion for learning. She was always prepared for class and could often be found buried in a textbook or working on a project in the library.  Despite her intelligence and academic success, Samantha struggled to make friends and was lonely and isolated. She preferred to spend her free time on her own, either studying or lost in a good book. Despite that, she was absolutely beautiful.\n\n“Mate, don’t stare at her, it’s rude,” Josh said with a wide smile.\n\n“Wha - I’m not staring.”\n\n“Yeah, sure,” he smiled. “Do you know his father? Jeremy Warren.”\n\n“Never heard of him,” I responded.\n\n“A fat piece of shit. I talked about him with officer Gregor. Jeremy was accused of murder and kidnapping in the past, but somehow always avoided prison. Every police in Harwich is corrupt, man.”\n\n“So the Warrens are criminals?” I raised my eyebrows.\n\n“There are rumors that…” he leaned closer, “they’re cultists. And the worst kind. They’re worshipers of the fucking Supreme God.”\n\n“Damn, these Supreme God idiots are in Harwich too… They’re slowly getting everywhere.”\n\n“Yep. In any other case, I’d recommend you to ask her out, but I think it’s better if you find someone else.”\n\n“Yeah, but - I mean, we don’t know if she’s a cultist too, or just the father. She seems too smart to believe in things like occultist gods and stuff like that.”\n\n“She’s definitely more intelligent than Jeremy, but for your own sake, leave them alone, or that old motherfucker will probably kill you. Literary.”\n\n“Yeah, you’re probably right,” I sighed.\n\n“You’re still thinking about it. Mate, I’m serious,” Josh insisted.\n\n“I know. I know. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”\n\nI think I wasn’t too convincing, as Josh wanted to say something again, but the bell rang, and we had to go to our history class. I don’t know if I was lucky or unlucky when the teacher, an old guy called Tom with a gray mustache, started to speak.\n\n“Today, you’re going to make a poster about the October Revolution. You’re working in pairs.”\n\nSo yeah, I got paired up with Samantha, but let’s just call her Sam from now on. Josh glanced at me from the other side of the classroom, shaking his head. *Don’t do anything stupid,* he probably would’ve told me.\n\n“I think I can draw Lenin and a few soldiers, you just need to help me color it,” she said, and then started working. She could, indeed, draw Lenin, but the soldiers’ faces looked a bit strange.\n\n“So, by the way, how are you?” I asked after a few minutes of awkward silence. \n\n“Uhm, fine, I guess.”\n\nAnother few minutes of silence followed, but at least I could start coloring the drawings. \n\n“By the way, do you have physics homework?” I tried to continue the conversation. She was so cute. “I forgot to do it yesterday, so…”\n\n“Yeah, I have it. I can… give it to you if you want, it’s in my backpack.” \n\nShe searched for her notebook in her bag for a few seconds, then gave it to me. \n\n“Thanks, I’ll give it back before our physics class.”\n\nAs I worked on the poster with Sam, I couldn't help but think about what Josh had told me about her father. It was hard to believe that someone I went to school with could be connected to murders or a cult. I tried to push those thoughts to the back of my mind and focus on the task at hand, but they kept creeping back up.\n\n“Have you heard anything about the worshipers of the Supreme God?” I asked, which surprised Sam. She quickly looked at me, so I just tried to act casual, like I wasn’t suspecting anything. “I heard about them from… from officer Gregor. He told me there are cultists in Harwich. Crazy, isn’t it?” \n\n“Never heard about it,” she responded, then turned back to draw for a few seconds, then looked at me again. “Officer Gregor, you say?”\n\n“Yep, you know, the one with the black beard. I heard he’s a piece of shit most of the time.”\n\n“What do you know about those cultists?” she sounded a bit anxious. “Did Gregor tell you anything?\n\n“Anything about what?”\n\n“Anything about the cultists.”\n\n“He told me we have a few of them in Harwich. But he hasn’t mentioned any names. A bit scary, isn’t it? You never know if someone you know is a cultist or not. Do you believe in the supreme god?”\n\n“Uhm, no. I’m an atheist.”\n\n“Yeah, just making sure,” I smiled. “Hah, imagine if…”\n\n“You know about my father, right?” I was shocked by this question. “You heard about the rumors that he’s a cultist. That we’re all cultists and criminals.”\n\n“Well, it’s true?” I raised my eyebrows.\n\n“I… I don’t really want to talk about it.”\n\n“Maybe I can help.”\n\n“You can’t,” she continued drawing the poster again. She didn’t look at me.\n\n“I promise I won’t tell anyone. Please, tell me.”\n\n“Listen, I don’t have anything to do with this. I’m not a criminal, I didn’t want to do this. I was born into this cult, and if I can get into a good university, I’ll leave them forever. I hope that’s enough for now.”\n\nShe looked sad, I felt bad for bringing up this topic, it was probably a bad idea. But at least I was right. She’s not a cultist. Her parents are. That certainly explained why she was such a good student. He learned so he could leave them and this whole city behind. It also explained her antisocial behavior. It must be hard living with cultists.\n\n“Yeah, sorry,” I apologized. “If I can help…”\n\n“You can’t. I can take care of it. Thanks.”\n\nAfter the class was over, and the teacher collected all the posters, I spoke with Josh again. \n\n“I told you she wasn’t a cultist like Jeremy,” I said.\n\n“So you had to bring up this topic, right? Mate, are you crazy?” Josh looked at me like I was some idiot. “Why?”\n\n“Don’t worry. She wants to leave her parents and the whole cult.”\n\n“Great, then wait for her to leave them, but don’t do anything stupid until then. Jeremy Warren is a fucking criminal, he can kill you at any time. Maybe he sacrifices you to his god, it’s serious, man, you’re playing with fire.”\n\n“You’re overreacting,” I tried to calm him down.\n\n“Overreacting? I’m trying to protect you. Don’t mess with the Warrens, man. Please. If you make a mistake, the Harwich police won’t save you from shit. Have you heard about the kid who went missing yesterday?”\n\n“Do you think the cultists kidnapped him?” \n\n“It happened when the kid wanted to walk home from kindergarten. And who lives just a few houses from the kindergarten? Jeremy fucking Warren.”\n\n“Where does he live exactly?”\n\nJosh stared at me for a few seconds with wide eyes, then shouted at me.\n\n“Mate, are you fucking crazy? Do you want to visit him or something? Can you just, please, forget about the Warrens? Including Sam and Jeremy too.”\n\n“Yeah, I know, and I will. Maybe not Sam, but…”\n\n“You’re an idiot, mate, and you’ll get in trouble,” With that, he sighed and walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts. And to be honest, he was mostly right, but I just couldn’t agree with him. It wasn’t right that someone had to live with a fucking cult just because she was born there. She deserved to be free. \n\nWhen I arrived home, I talked about the Warrens with my parents. They didn’t know about them or about the existence of the cultists. They gave me almost the same advice as Josh. They were worried, which was a natural response, they’re my parents, after all. It was the safest option. But it wasn’t right. \n\nA bit after dinner, I went upstairs to my room to sleep. About an hour went by, and I was still awake, laying on my back, thinking about what had happened that day. It was a quiet night, the only sound that could be heard was the ticking of the old clock that stood at the end of the hallway. Then I got a text from Sam. I was happy at first, thinking that I made a good impression, but then I read the message.\n\n“Please, tell me you’re awake.”\n\n“I’m awake, everything’s okay?” I texted back.\n\n“My father knows that you know about the cult. He said he’ll take care of you. He left the house, please be safe.”\n\n“What?” I felt my heart beating faster and faster. “You told him?”\n\n“No, it wasn’t me. I don’t know how he found out. He even knows where you live. I swear I didn’t tell him anything.”\n\n“I’ll write in a minute.”\n\nI quickly jumped out of my bed and tried to think of a solution. *If Jeremy Warren is looking for me, and he even knows where I live, I’m in danger,* I thought. I was thinking about who told him about me. Only Josh and Sam knew about my interest in this fucking cult. If it wasn’t Sam, then it must’ve been Josh, but I couldn’t believe he would do such a thing. I had known him since we were little kids, I was sure it wasn’t him. But then who?\n\nSuddenly, I heard a car's engine in the distance. As the sound grew louder, I knew the car was getting closer. As I was thinking about the fact that I was going to die there, I got out of bed and walked over to the window. Peering out through the curtains, I saw a black car pulling up to the curb in front of my house. I watched as a half-eyed man in his 50s got out of the driver's seat. I had never seen that man in my life, but I immediately recognized him. Jeremy Warren. \n\nI rushed back to my bed and grabbed my phone to call 911. As I was about to call them, I froze as I heard our doorbell. He then pressed it again. And again. \n\n“Who the fuck is?” I heard my father walking downstairs. “This late at night, I hope it’s important. “\n\nHell yeah, Dad, it was fucking important, and I had no idea what to do. I couldn’t press the button to call the police, I was afraid Jeremy would hear me. I was too scared to breathe. My father opened the door.\n\n“Good eve - oh, Mr. Warren! What a surprise, I -”\n\n“Where is your fucking son?” Jeremy asked. My mother walked there too. They both knew what Jeremy wanted.\n\n“He’s not home, Mr. Warren,” my dad responded. “He went to a sleepover with his friend, Josh -”\n\n“Get out of my way,” Jeremy shouted.\n\n“Mr. Warren, please stop!” I heard my mother screaming, as I heard footsteps from the stairs, getting closer to my room. “That’s enough, Warren!”\n\nAs my survival instincts started to kick in, I ran to my window and opened it. I had to jump out of it, it was the only way outside. Luckily, it wasn’t that high, I could’ve easily survived that jump. \n\nAs I was taking a deep breath, Jeremy kicked my bedroom door open. He rushed at me as soon as he saw me climbing through the window. \n\n“You fucking bastard. You think you’re clever, huh? I’ll kill you, you piece of shit!”\n\n“Mr. Warren, please leave or I’ll call the police,” my mother commanded as she and dad soon followed Jeremy into my room, but it was too late.\n\nJeremy caught me. I immediately got a punch to my nose, then he smashed my head into the wall. As my father tried to attack Jeremy, that motherfucker pushed me out of the window. I heard my mom screaming my name as I was falling, then I hit the ground.\n\nI have no idea how much time had gone by when I regained my consciousness, but I was laying on the ground. I could barely move my arms and legs. Everything hurt. \n\nThe front door slammed open, and Jeremy ran out of my house, straight toward me. My father grabbed Jeremy’s arm, then hit him in the mouth. Jeremy lost balance for a second, then he punched my father even harder. Dad fell to the ground, and my mother kneeled beside him, crying. I was angered. I was fucking angered.\n\n“Come and kill me, you motherfucker, leave my parents alone,” I shouted. At least, I wanted to shout, but It was as loud as a whisper because of that fall. \n\n“Don’t worry, I will, bastard,” Jeremy kicked me in the head before I could get up, then started beating me. I was bleeding from my nose and my mouth. He punched me again, and again, and again. I could still hear my mom crying a few meters away. Then I heard sirens, then an unknown voice.\n\n“Jeremy, stop right there, or I’ll shoot!”\n\n“Stop intervening, Gregor,” Jeremy shouted. I kept thinking, nearing a blackout. Gregor. Maybe it was officer Gregor? I tried to focus with my eyes, but I could only see a shadowy figure pointing a handgun at Jeremy. And I blacked out. \n\nI woke up in a hospital bed, I don’t know how much later, but I think it was a few hours at maximum. I looked beside me, there was officer Gregor talking with a doctor, who just noticed that I was awake. \n\n“Oh, you woke up,” the old doctor said with a smile. “Don’t worry, everything is okay. I won’t judge you because of this suicide attempt, you’ll get the help you need, and everything will be fine.”\n\n“Suicide attempt?” I asked. “But I -”\n\n“Can I talk with him in private, doctor?” officer Gregor said. The doctor nodded and went out of the room. Gregor leaned closer.\n\n“Listen here, boy. Don’t mess with the Warrens, Jeremy almost killed you,” he whispered.\n\n“Suicide attempt?”\n\n“You know how it works, mate. Don’t worry, I told them I’ll send you to a psychologist. Of course, that won’t happen.”\n\n“Who called you? My mom?”\n\n“Hah,” he smiled. “You wouldn’t believe it. Samantha Warren, Jeremy’s daughter. I don’t know why she did that, but I hope you aren’t fucking a fucking Warren, boy. Jeremy would kill you for it. Well, he almost did…”\n\n“I wanted to say thank you for saving me, but I’d rather not, I’ll thank Sam instead,” I said.\n\n“You’re rude.”\n\n“And you’re the reason things like this can happen. You and your corrupt friends let Jeremy and the cultists do what they want.”\n\n“Well, that’s fair,” Gregor sighed. “You know, boy, I wanted to be a police since I was 6. I wanted to be a hero, I wanted to save innocent people and fight villains like… well, villains like Jeremy Warren. But this is reality. And the villains are stronger than us, boy, with shady tactics and no morals. Especially these cultists. Anyway, the old guy will let you go home in a few days.”\n\n“My parents?”\n\n“They’re fine. And please, leave the fucking Warrens alone. Later, kid.”\n\nMy brain had to process these events. Jeremy almost killed me, but then Sam saved me by calling the police. I always knew she wasn’t like her father. I had to save her, especially now, now that I know her father is a fucking psychopath. She deserves to leave Jeremy and that cult behind.

        "text": "So, first thing I want to give you guys a bit of background. I am a 22 year old Vietnamese girl, I have a normal life since I was born, my family is a normal middle class one, never been into anything occult or shady that I know of. I live in a populated area in Ho Chi Minh City and I have never seen anything out of the ordinary... that is, until yesterday.\n\nAs many of you guys know, 2023 has just come, about 5 days into 2023 now, but we're still not done celebrating as there's still a Lunar New Year coming up. It's around this time that my family want to clean the whole house to let out all of the bad energy and \"embrace\" the new year. So. it started when my mom woke me up at 7:00AM to clean, I was given the task of the attic, since both my parents have bad ankle problems and my brother was out for school.\n\nSo I had breakfast, a few nagging here and there from my mom at me for being so young but so lazy at the same time. I didn't mind them very much since I know they come from a place of love, also, this activity always happens every year, so I just don't mind it very much. My house is a normal 3 story house, my family used to have relatives who lived here for some times until they're more financially stable to move out, so now the 3rd floor is currently rented by my university friend. He has gone back to his hometown for Lunar New Year with his family since we're all done with our semester. His room is right next to the attic entrance.\n\nThe attic is quite dusty and dark, with quite many boxes of books and family albums, old stuffs from my deceased grandparents that my dad doesn't want to throw out. I have to clean up the attic, find stuffs from last year that are either too broken to be repaired/out of use and then clean up the mess on the 3rd floor after I'm done dusting. I put on my earplugs and began to dust the whole place, when I was done, I looked through the box that wrote 2022 on it (my family keep track of these things, basically it's just a pile of trash that my parents didn't want to throw but have no knowledge on how to fix them so they just pile it like \"hoarders\" on those American shows, and use this opportunity each year to tell me to clean their mess). As I was sifting through the trash piles, my eyes stumbled on what seemed like the old family computer set, with the keyboard, monitor,... everything. I got hit with a wind of nostalgia, all my memories of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, long lost dead anime online forums, nights of playing Java games with my brother, Yahoo Messenger... if you were born in the 2000's in Vietnam then you might be very familiar with what I just described. After what felt like a good 5 minutes of reminiscing, I suddenly remembered that I can ask my mom if I can sell this old hunk of junk away for some snacks money, to my surprise, both my mom and dad were super chill about it and agreed to let me sell it away.\n\nIt took me around 1 hour to move it to my room on the second floor, I tried to clear my desk to plug it in, because still working computer and monitor can make more money. To my surprise, the old junk did work! The nostalgic Windows 2000 music hit my eardrums, and my old Admin account with the stupid picture of me and brother are still there. I decided to retrieve back every old thing on the computer, like one last goodbye before sending a piece of my childhood away. Then, I saw the desktop screen with the scenery picture of Hanoi that my mom loved, and to add more to my surprise. I saw the old Yahoo Messenger icon! Yahoo Messenger was a big thing in Vietnam during the 2000's - early 2010's, it was a thing for middle schooler, high schooler, hell, literally every young person to have a Yahoo Messenger account. It was announced dead back in 2018.\n\nExcitedly, I clicked on the application without thinking much, then strangely, it connected! I could see the log in screen and everything, as if it was never dead to begin with. I decided to experiment, I looked through my old diary to find the memo of my old account information, I thought it would be funny to show old chat logs of me and my friends again. As I hit that log in button, I was left speechless at the working site. My friends are online! I was scrubbing my eyes to double check if I was hallucinating. No. It's fucking real and working. Then, a friend of mine texted me. I didn't think of grabbing my phone to ask everyone, I just straight up chatted on Yahoo, thinking the site had a revival when I was cleaning or sleeping. (note: I translated our chat logs so everyone reading this will understand.)\n\n\"Hey, so you just joined the party huh?\"  \n\"holy shit, did something happen when i was asleep? did they revive yahoo?\"\n\nShe took a while to type, then she replied.\n\n\"Yes\"  \n\"Why are you cursing?\"\n\nThat's a bit weird, she used to be keen with no cursing when she was young but with college, she became a potty mouth. I figured this was a joke, she wanted to re-enact like we were 6th graders.\n\n\"sorry\". I replied.  \n\"did you do the homework miss hoa gave us?\", she asked, she was really into this act, I thought.  \n\"no, but what will that old broad do anyway? let's rebel!\", I giggled while typing because we both hated miss H when we were in 6th grade.\n\nThen, she took another while.\n\n\"I think we should kill her.\"  \n\"I've been thinking about it since the day I saw her.\"\n\n\"Okay, that is... a little too far into this whole shtick\". I thought to myself. I was thinking of a way to respond to this joke in a way that's not too harsh but still funny enough to end this whole gimmick. Then, she bombarded me with texts. I will list some of the weirdest ones for you guys.\n\n\"I know there is a little hole the size of a dog in her kitchen that face the back alley\"  \n\"I want to hammer her head like meat\"  \n\"Please go, please, esaelp, kill her, llik rhe\"  \n\"Tonight is a perfect time for manhunt\"\n\nThen, a bombardment of laughing stickers, it was constantly sent with the speed of light, filling up my ears to the point that I was nauseous, I took off my earplugs but the horrible laughter still echoes throughout, filled up the whole room with distorted sounds that I thought was from hell. I crawled to my bed in pure shock from horror to text my friend to stop. Then, it stopped.\n\nI thought to myself that she saw my message and decided to stop this creepy ass, completely out of time, cruel joke. As I gathered enough strength to walk back to my desk, I received the last message from the account.\n\n\"Fine\", then I was blocked, completely flabbergasted from what just happened. When I checked my phone, she blocked me on every other social medias, even my phone number too.\n\nWhether she somehow got the personality of a method actor, or the complete insanity to actually become a killer... both seemed out of reach to me. I talked with my other friends to ask them if they have gotten into the same joke, that's when I realized two things. First, no one seemed to have any memory of talking to her since elementary school, even the one that went to the same college as her (**or so I remember**). Second, no one has heard of anything about a \"Yahoo Revival\". \n\nA sudden chill ran through my neck to my spine, I looked at my seemingly normal computer, and its screen still updating messages and the people online. I was too stunned to even reply back to my friends, as if something was pushing my mental to ***use*** this computer. I went on to look for Miss Hoa's account. \n\nStrangely enough, I was friends with Miss Hoa on Yahoo. I might be a cringy kid back then, but I completely had a hatred for the education system back then, when I was having trouble and no one tried to help, how could I even talk for hours with a teacher? I scrolled the chat logs, what makes it even weirder was that I talked to her about **literally everything.** And she was acting like my mom, the compliments, the soothing, the \"maternal\" talks that were borderline grooming and pedophilic gagged me to my throat. I could never imagine or even fathom the idea of some sick fuck that wanted or even thought of doing this, it was way out of my imagination that someone could plan this whole thing out.\n\nI went to the bathroom to vomit, and I was too scared to go back to my room, so I stayed in the living room for the whole afternoon, it seemed like my soul has left my body and I was just an empty husk, staring at the TV with no purpose. After 3 grueling hours of staring and my parents asking me non-stop about what happened, I decided to walk back to my room and throw this whole shit out. That was way more than enough, after that, I'm gonna go to a monastery and get myself a fucking exorcism.\n\nI hesitantly opened my room, it's January in southern Vietnam, so it should be warm enough for a t-shirt and shorts, but the moment I walked into my room, it was dreadfully cold, the type of cold that I have never experienced before, the type of cold that wanted to suck out every warmth I have in my body. The monitor was still up and running, lighting up my desk, I looked at it and was spooked with a new message, this time, it was from Miss Hoa.\n\n\"why have you been so silent\"  \n\"i know you're seeing this\"  \n\"you have been away for too long dear\"  \n\"are you keeping any secret from mommy\"  \n\"you are making mommy very sad\"  \n\"i am      sad     sad     sad   sad   sad\"  \n\" sad     sad     sad   sad   sad\"  \n\" sad     sad     sad   sad   sad sad     sad     sad   sad   sad\"  \n\"**there is someone in my house**\"\n\nI was frozen to my seat, I had no courage or strength left in me to close the damn app, I was on the verge of tears. my whole body felt like it was undergone some type of Medieval torture. I sat looking at the chat bubble stopping at the last message to what felt like an eternity. Then, another chat bubble showed up from an anonymous account.\n\nIt attached a blurry picture from what seemed like it was taken from a desktop camera in the dark, it was pitch black so I couldn't see anything. Then, another picture came, this time, it was dimly lit but I still couldn't see jack shit. Then, the pictures of the same dark room kept coming every one minute, until I realized what seemed like a red tint coming from the flash. I tried my very best to block out the possibility of what I've already known, this time, the horror was too much and I started whimpering, then, after 10 minutes or so, I saw a horribly disfigured finger lying on a pool of blood, as if someone was violently cracking every possible bone of it barehanded. And then came the image of my \"friend\" holding the mutilated finger and smiling at the camera, her eyes were devoid of any life, her smile was grinned upward to her cheekbones, revealing what seemed like flesh meat the middle of her teeth cracks and the rotted gum with oozing pus, then came the pictures of her holding a mallet, and then the last one was just pure red filling up the whole picture. At this point, the fear was more than enough to activate every neuron in my brain, I was overflowed with adrenaline, I didn't even bother to unplug the computer, I ran straight out, crying out every possible liquid in my body.\n\nMy mom, dad and brother came running to me, I couldn't stop crying and stuttering something about that computer. My brother went into my room to check it out, to his amusement, he laughed out loud, saying I was crying over \"looking at the computer\". My mom and dad walked me into my room to check, the computer...strangely did not even have Yahoo on, it was just a normal desktop screen. I was able to center myself, I think my mom and dad said something about keeping it because it's still working, I did not hear any of that. I yanked out every cord, told my brother to help me carry them downstairs to sell it. I was adamant that I must get this computer out of my house or else I will leave the house and never come back. My parents shrugged it off, thinking I was throwing a fit because I wanted some extra money, and told me to sell if if that's what I wanted.\n\nMy brother hopped on the motorbike and drove me holding the monitor and the computer, he was constantly picking on me about the crying fit I threw earlier like the asshole he is, but I kept silent because I'm still trying to stop shaking and try to forget that horrific scene I just saw and that horrible smile. My brother just kept talking and I was busy trying to think how to not think, we didn't realize that there was another bike that drove next to us, next thing I know, the computer was snatched off my hand, and the monitor fell on the ground, shattered by a car that drove right on it. My brother wanted to chase after them, but I told him to stop. I just wanted this nightmare to end. It took some reasonings and none of them really satisfied my brother, but there was no way for us to go after the muggers, so we went home. I lied to my parents that I sold it for 1 million (I had to bribe my brother so he would keep his mouth shut about all this). That night was the first night I slept with my brother since I was 7. I was having nightmares throughout the whole night.\n\nI woke up to the news of a relative that found miss Hoa dead in her room this morning, according to my friend who was her neighbor, she was decapitated, and her head was smashed into a chunk of meat, no one could even make out which body part was which. I couldn't muster a word. My dad took us to go to my grandparents house this afternoon. When I was in the passenger seat looking at the city and the crowd, I saw a rugged, skinny man driving a worn down Honda Cub, that red helmet was to no surprise, looked just like behind him was a little girl with pigtails in uniform of my old secondary school. The little girl then turned pale and her jaw started to fall off as she started shaking her head uncontrollably, then they disappear into the traffic. \n\nI guess that computer has found its next victim.",
