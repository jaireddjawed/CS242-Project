Do they always just replace them when servicing at regular intervals (3-5 years)? Part of the appeal of well-made watches for me includes retaining the same movement throughout the life of the watch. Personally I think it’s weird that the movement would just get 86’ed. I get it from a business perspective (cheaper than the man hours to service), but I think it’s pretty lame from a watch lover’s perspective. And it makes me think twice about buying a watch case, dial and hands with a disposable movement.",

However, the purchase won’t happen until this coming fall so I don’t need it atm. \n\nWife is fine with it, but want to make sure I’m not being stupid. \n\nThe watch is a little less than 1/2 our monthly take home after insurance and retirement.",

When I saw it first time  I didn't like it, but suddenly something snap inside of me and I tought I must have it. Maybe because my parents use to have old black plastic  Casios. \n\nLast one (Orient bambino) was bought because I wanted to have some nice dress watch for weddings, etc.\n\nI strongly believe that this is it for this year.\nWhat do you think about my collection?\nIn future I want to buy some swiss made watches, but it doesn't bother me.

It is a manually wound movement and I can pull out the crown and it moves freely.  I just don’t know if moving it in the wrong direction will damage it?  From what little I can find, the movement is removed from the front.  Will any watch repair be able to service it?  \n\nVietnam Era military issue. The first plastic cased military issue field watch. This one is dated July 1966.\n\nThe plastic bodies were issued I believe from 1964 to 1970. They are also stamped \"Non-maintainable\" meaning they were meant to be thrown away if they stopped working. Later versions included a stainless body.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dzz5ieel5na1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6166c54e50b1a92199567cee25cc427a91e49068",
