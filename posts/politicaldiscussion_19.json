Their top pick for an alternative? Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The GOP governor, who won a resounding reelection last month, enjoyed much stronger favorability ratings than Trump among Republicans, according to the CNN survey.\n\nWith Trump, it is always difficult to predict what he might do next, or when he is serious and when he is not. Is there a chance that if Trump for some reason does not get a nomination that he may actually decide to run as a third-party candidate? \n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/trump-posts-article-urging-him-ditch-gop-run-third-party-candidate-1770560](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-posts-article-urging-him-ditch-gop-run-third-party-candidate-1770560)",
