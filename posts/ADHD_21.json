For example, I would like to be able to under one area / topic, be able to include and organise website links, photos, reddit posts, my own thoughts etc.\n\nAs I know people in this sub will apprciate, I often spend alot of time researching things then forget the details or can't find where I read/saw something again, and I also often flit around topics. So something that can help me organise this would be great.\n\nThanks so much!",

However, I feel like it requires so much energy and mental discipline/diligence to maintain this current baseline and I just can‚Äôt help but wonder if it‚Äôs THISSS hard for those without ADHD?!?! Lol. I spoke to my psychiatrist about trying medication and took a genetic test that recommends different prescriptions based on my system. The only stimulants that were on the ‚Äúok‚Äù list were Adderall and Concerta. My Psych said he preferred that I try 40mg of Strattera first and see how I feel after 3 months.

It made me feel calm, more motivated, and helped with my mood, which I feel very thankful for. However, as usual, I am still taking extremely long on tasks which make my job difficult to keep up with. I am still taking 10 hours completing a task that would only take others 2 hours to complete, which means i have to be working many hours after the workday ends to stay on track. We have tried upping the dose but I haven't really noticed an effect in this area. \n\nObviously I will let my psychiatrist know at my next appointment, but I am just curious if this is pretty typical with ADHD meds.\n\nHave you had a similar experience, and if so did changing your medication help? Or is this something that you have worked on primarily through your therapy sessions?",

An UN- is someone who carries the title and power of a title. The UN- lurks in the shadows actually doing nothing and only communicating through underlings they control, or vague emails/texts that have a lot of words but says nothing and definitely doesn't answer the questions asked.\n\nThis UN-principal never replied to my first email and instead had the teacher I had already spoken to who did not have the answers call me back. When I managed to stop the UN-principal before she could flee after a school information session she looped the same information over and over without actually answering my question.\n\n Now the UN-principal is having an actual principal I don't know reply to me instead of herself. Yet this principal wrote pages of words and still doesn't answer my questions. Perhaps I have discovered a new tactic of the UN-, cooperating with each other to respond to each other's challengers when they have no choice but to respond! This will indeed be a fascinating new behavior to study! üßê",

I get extremely self-conscious about it and whenever my parents even imply coming in I get so nervous I start crying. I'm just really embarrassed about it and can't ever motivate myself to clean it in one session like everyone else can just because there's too much mess.\n\nWe're moving out in a few months, and putting the house on the market even sooner, so I need to get this done fast so I don't have a panic attack over people going in my room. I know the pressure of people going in motivates some people to clean their rooms faster but it makes me lose motivation and break down and just try to keep people out. My parents reminding me about cleaning it just makes me even more anxious too and then I try and come up with ways to make them forget about it so I don't have to clean. I'm that unmotivated.\n\nI've decided to get it done over spring break with each day having a couple hours dedicated to cleaning one area of my room since this strategy has worked better for me than other ones. Gonna put clothes I don't wear often and extra books into some moving boxes, throw away trash, etc. My main worry is I'm going to run out of steam after day 1 and wallow miserably with no motivation. What can I do to stay motivated and clean as fast as possible?",

But now, it seems the effect goes away in less than 2-3 hours and then I just feel fatigued. Tried Vyvanse, Rittalin XR, different doses, but it's all the same. I'm almost giving up. \n\nRecently, I found out that I have very poor sleep quality. Even when I sleep for 8+ hours I never feel rested; I'm always tired. Well, turns out that wasn't normal, so I went to a sleep doctor, and he thinks I might have sleep apnea. I also saw sleep apnea is quite common in ADHD.\n\nI'm gonna have a sleep study next month, and I'm quite curious whether the fact that my sleep might be being comprimised might be the reason why the meds are not kicking in as they should. Does anyone here has a similiar experience?",

Accept that you may not get the exact price, colour, feature, analogue/digital, brand, backlight type combination you want. Instead, bite the bullet on one that fits your budget and allows you to quickly set a timer. \r\n2. Buy. Get a watch that you can quickly / easily set a timer.\r\n3. Measure. The rest of the 3 weeks you would have spent deciding can be getting to know yourself better and better understanding how long it takes for you to complete tasks. It's quite eye-opening once you start measuring. I can almost guarantee tasks take you longer than you think at first. Much longer. The first time I did it I thought the task would take me 10 minutes. It took around 30.\r\n4. Improve. Repeat. By making it a habit, a routine.\r\n\r\nSome tips:\r\n* limit this technique to 20 or 30 minutes maximum **|---&gt;** longer than that can likely be broken into smaller tasks\r\n* use it for anything and everything **|---&gt;** taking out the trash, washing dishes, studying, writing, etc. \r\n* use the built-in timers in other things to multitask more effectively **|---&gt;** dishwasher, washing machine, microwave, for example, have their own timers, while they're running use your watch timer to smash out other tasks. \r\n* use this technique to also limit hyperfocusing or spending too much time on tasks that are just distractions, or that you're using to procrastinate.\r\n* **can't I just use my phone?** **|---&gt;** What are you reading this post on? Most likely you're phone, right? It's hard enough managing executive functioning with the many things we can't control. We should sometimes voluntarily \"opt-out\" of the many distractions in our control. Recognising these distractions can sometimes be very challenging, but not impossible.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Get a watch.

Turns out, it has greatly helped with my performance at work too and my lack of attention. I was assessed for ADHD earlier this year, and they said that I didn't tick enough boxes to be diagnosed with ADHD, despite my inattention having really affected several aspects of my life. \n\nSo yes, nortriptyline was working like a charm. The problem now is I have developed a constant unexplained tachycardia, my resting pulse is now 90-110 and a couple of weeks ago I had to go to the ED because my pulse wouldn't go below 130. Yesterday I had another similar episode, and I have a pulse of 125-145 for most part of the afternoon. I am having investigations, but so far everything has come back normal and I have no cardiac history. \n\nIt is quite scary and I have read that tachycardia is a known serios side effect of nortriptyline, and it could even cause atrial fibrillation. So I have decided I am going to start reducing my dose slowly.\n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience with nortriptyline? Am I right to think it could be causing my symptoms? \n\nAnd before you say it yes, I'm going to see a doctor, but I don't have the appointment for another two weeks and I'm quite worried. I also know that the nortriptyline has to be reduced slowly, thankfully I am only taking 20 mg. \n\nThanks in advance for your insights.",

This drug has benefited me in extraordinary ways; however, I am currently in a phase of my life where I am struggling to decide how much longer I would like to take this medication. I have never viewed this medication as a life-long solution but rather more of a band-aid for the low stage of my life I was in. Yet, doctors and peers seem to endorse ADHD medication, with joint statements surrounding the encouragement of taking it your entire life. However, as years have passed, I have concerns over its impact on my overall **energy levels** and **short-term memory**. Even with these concerns, I hesitate to come off my medication as there never seems to be a *good time to do so.* \n\nAs I view coming off this medication as a big decision, I am hoping to gain more knowledge and research on the long-term effects. It's been very hard to come across anything peer-reviewed, and I have significant doubts that consuming methylphenidate for 5+ years, let alone your entire life, is not negatively impacting the body and mind in one way or another. For instance, I am aware that more research is being done on the correlation between [stimulants and Parkinson's in adulthood.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8984208/)\n\nThank you in advance!",

Your ADHD and whatever difficulties it may bring are not justifications for your partner to berate, belittle, or otherwise insult your intelligence or worth as a person. You are not stupid, you are not dumb, you are not useless.\n\nEvery relationship has problems, and ADHD can make relationships more difficult in some aspects. But if your partner is attacking your character and making you question your value as a human being, it has gone beyond a simple conflict - you are being abused.\n\nI highly encourage anyone who's in a difficult relationship situation right now and is fearful that their ADHD makes them unlovable or difficult, to re-examine your relationship and consider that your partner may be using your diagnosis as an excuse to bully and hurt you.",

It keep me awake night after night, nothing helped with it. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-20s. It's only just occurred to me that I haven't suffered from restless legs since I started taking ADHD meds (3 years ago - first Concerta now steady on Elvanse for 2 years). \n\nI've suffered from plenty of sleepless nights in the past 3 years (my sleep improved dramatically after I started on meds, but I went through a traumatic experience last year and my sleep has been atrocious since then). But I don't have restless legs, I just cannot sleep because of flashbacks. \n\nIt's crazy to me that I don't have to suffer from this problem anymore! I hadn't even thought of restless legs for the longest time. My doctor prescribed sleeping meds last week and couldn't actually sleep because restless legs was a side effect (it was even mentioned in the pamphlet). That's what made me realise I just don't get restless legs anymore. I used to be kept awake by it nearly every day, it drove me insane and I thought I would suffer from it forever as there is no known treatment.",

I can never do anything anymore, and I just sit in my chair all day. It's obviously very frustrating, because I have a million things to do, and they keep piling up.\n\nI'm considering running into a wall full speed to knock myself out, and maybe wake up semi-functional (/s. unless...?).

What good timing for me to screw up.\n\nI'd been doing well for the past few months, but just in the last week or so I've felt so foggy and unfocused.

However, my psychiatrist wants to address all of my conditions except for ADHD until they are more manageable. \n\nDespite explaining that my ADHD contributes significantly to my anxiety and depression, my psychiatrist instructed me to complete several questionnaires and an observer evaluation, but at my latest appointment, she had not yet reviewed them, even though it had been three weeks.\nI have been struggling with these issues my entire life but only sought help recently. \n\nDuring my last appointment, I expressed feeling helpless, embarrassed, and defeated by my ADHD problems. I have been avoiding working with others for the past eight years until August, and I returned to school to pursue a Master's degree, but both have been overwhelmingly frustrating.\n\nMy psychiatrist has advised me to quit both work and school, but that is not a viable option for me. As someone who usually favors a holistic approach to diagnoses, I now feel lost and am willing to try anything. I am even considering seeking medication from another psychiatrist via an online appointment, which my current psychiatrist has refused to prescribe.\n\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice",
