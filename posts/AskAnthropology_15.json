Because of this, I am aspiring towards a career in my second passion: Neuropsychology. I am a little concerned with my path. I am in a multidisciplinary Anthropology program which includes 30 credit hours of Anthropology and 30 credit hours of a chosen field(s) which will all be Psychology related. My goal is to eventually earn a PhD in Neuroscience, Behavioral Neuroscience, Neuropsychology, or Clinical Psychology with a Neuroscience-related concentration.\n\nI know that this is strange, but I am hoping that by entering my current university's MA Psych program will be relatively easy since I am getting my BA here. With a MA in Psych, I am hoping another school will accept me for a PhD program in a related field.\n\n**I am wondering if anyone else has received a bachelors in Anthro and applied for another major in Grad successfully, or if I am really silly for thinking I could have the best of both worlds.** I want some experience in Anthro because I LOVE it, and I believe it's scholastically relevant to many disciplines, especially the social sciences. I don't want to give it up..\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, your ~~un~~friendly neighbourhood moderator here.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to welcome our newest addition to the mod team, /u/CommodoreCoCo! They have been working hard behind the scenes for a bit over a month now, and any improvement of our moderation is due to them.\n\nOn this note, we are still accepting more moderators to join us! The requirements are, as before:  \n\n* Being somewhat active in reddit  \n* Being able to use /r/toolbox and join our Slack workspace  \n* Being a flaired user is a big plus\n\n--------------\n\nHowever, this is not what this post is for. This post is for us to discuss a change in the subreddit's rules. We all know this has been long overdue ([a bit over three months, in fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/8cq8ev/upcoming_changes_in_the_subreddit/)), but with our mod team spreading ever thinner, and considering this is not the best time of the year regarding \"free time\" (June~September is conference season for many of us, as well as \"holidays\" that we are supposed to spend with our families and/or manuscripts, and ~~in my case it's when I get hired to do some odd jobs~~ so on), so reddit modding was left a bit behind, and I apologise for that.\n\nThat being said, we also realise that improving the subreddit's rules would make our job as moderators much easier -- as was the case in /r/Anthropology. Thus, we have written some (tentative) new rules, and would like for you, our userbase, to let us know what you think of them.  \nLike with /r/Anthropology, this is *not* an unilateral imposition of rules, and we would rather for these to be discussed and improved than being applied as-is.\n\nSo, without further ado, this is the mod team's suggestions for /r/AskAnthropology's new rules:\n\n\n&gt; 1. **Questions should be about anthropology**. Badly written questions will be deleted, but can be asked again if rewritten. No dinosaurs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. **Don't ask**: \n&gt; \n&gt;  1)\"What if\"/\"In the future\" questions  \n&gt;  2) \"Poll-type\" questions  \n&gt;  3) Homework questions (go to /r/HomeworkHelp)  \n&gt;  4) \"Change my view\" questions (go to /r/changemyview)  \n&gt;  5) \"Help me debunk\" questions (go to /r/Badanthropology)  \n&gt;  6) Career questions (ask them in our weekly career thread)  \n&gt;  7) Recommendation questions (ask them in our weekly recommendation thread)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. **Answers should be informed and in-depth**. Short, explicitly speculative answers will be removed.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Answers do not have to include citations but they are encouraged. **If asked for sources, commenters should provide them**.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. **\"Race realism\", \"human biodiversity\", conspiracy theories, and similar pseudoscience will be removed; as will any other content that is incorrect or not supported by reputable scholarship**. Asking questions *about* those is fine. If [JAQing](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions) is obvious, thread will be deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. **Be nice and civil**. If you are asking a question, don't be confrontational -- you are here to learn. If you are answering a question, don't be condescending -- no one was born knowing everything.\n\nAs you can see with rules 2.6 and 2.7, we also want to start hosting weekly career and recommendation threads. I was also considering -- based on /u/otherwisepain's [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/93467k/a_list_of_frequently_asked_questions_in_this_sub/) -- hosting a weekly \"highlights\" thread, where we would post good answers that could later on be added to [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/wiki/faq) (we do have one, it's just a work in slow progress) (if anyone wants to carry the FAQ work forward, send us a PM).\n\nSo yeah, that is the gist of it. Let us know what are your thoughts on all of this. This thread will be pinned and the rules will be left unchanged for the moment. In some weeks' time, after we have discussed and moved forward with the text, there's going to be a new announcement thread, so keep your eyes open.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nJust looking for a bit of advice. I graduated this past year from a US state university with a B. A. in anthropology and am now working full time at an anthropology-focused organization. \n\nI did a pretty decent mix of cultural anthropology and archaeology during my undergrad, but was never able to get an official field school in. I'm pretty sure now that I want to pursue archaeology professionally. I'd like to eventually get a PhD, either abroad or in the US, but I don't feel quite ready or qualified to commit to that yet.\n\nThe archaeology I did study in undergrad was regionally focused on Ireland, and I did a handful of independent studies on the region. I also spent a semester abroad in Ireland, so it's definitely the area I'd like to do research on. I have about a year of lab experience as well (refitting, analysis, cleaning, etc). \n\nSo--the actual question is, should I do a masters in archaeology in ireland? Do I have a chance of being admitted? Will it make a difference in applying for a PhD at some point? I'd really like to get back there, and be able to finally do some hands on research in the country, in addition to strengthening my background in archaeology as a whole. \n\nAnyway, any insight on your own experiences studying abroad for post-grad would be great!Thanks!

I thought it was a really good illustrated survey of Clovis, Pre-Clovis, and problematic sites; however, this is really the first book I've read concerning archaeology and anthropology. I know there has been some controversy concerning Clovis and Pre-Clovis finds. I understand from reading through r/anthropology and r/Archaeology after reading this book that the controversy was long brewing but Pre-Clovis is now accepted. I didn't think to come to reddit first for a book recommend. I wanted to know how respected these authors are and how their work is taken. I think they did a wonderful job of laying things out, but I wanted to know how well they did or how well they are respected in general.\n\nWhat further books would you recommend for furthering my understanding of prehistoric migration patterns or understanding what we know about early human societies? What authors should I stay away from in terms of authors pushing questionable genetic (supremacy) ideas?\n\nI love the idea of thinking about the ways in which we underestimate our ancestors. For instance, I love the idea of desert kites and the hunting corral found in 2014 under Lake Huron.",

To give some context: I'm a game developer with a fondness for business management and social simulation games. A while ago I was working on a pet project: an agent based business simulation with a focus on consumer behaviour. Partway through that project I happened to read Ernest Becker's Escape From Evil, and I was extremely intrigued by the notion that \"money is sacred\". The links Becker was drawing between trade, economics, spirituality, and political power made me consider whether I could increase the scope of my market simulation to make it into a broader social simulation where the market is but one aspect.\n\nI also realized that while the text of that book had piqued me curiosity and given me food for thought, I had no tangible idea on how to realistically model the inter-relations of those areas. So I'm hoping that someone knowledgeable in the field can point me to some good resources to read up on. I figure I should be looking for authors who fall smack in the middle of economic and political anthropology. I'd be partial to books/studies that do a good job of supporting theory with empirical evidence.\n\nTIA :)",

So populations thousands of years ago will share no genetic resemblance and only maybe show so some continuity. Why is that? I know that kids only get 50% of their parents's dna but is there a way to see how genetically similar some ancient populations were to the Modern ones? I tried to make a research about it but I'm so confused. I saw some models in a Eupedia forum saying what percentage of Mycenaean dna modern greeks have and what percentage of their dna is indo European but I can't understand were they got their information or if these are some short of speculations.

        "text": "I have a baby, an undergrad anthropology degree, and a nerdy husband who likes to talk about science with me. And this topic was both an interesting conversation and also a stumper for us. \n\nIf we assume that babies are a blank slate so to speak where acculturation and social norms are concerned, and we assume that kissing is probably not a biologically innate thing (OR IS IT?), what causes our baby to smile and coo when we kiss him?\n\nHas he already learned that when humans in our culture kiss, it's to show affection? Is it related to other kinds of touch babies tend to enjoy, like blowing raspberries on his belly? Is it a chain reaction because often we are holding him when he gets a kiss, and he likes being held? Does it just feel good?\n\nWe were contrasting it with hugs, which seem obvious and universal due to their connection with being held. It seems clear why a baby would be happy to be picked up and held by his parents. The question of why a baby would be happy to be kissed by his parents is less clear.\n\nEight months seems pretty key to us, where this question is concerned, because at this point he clearly perceives a lot of things and is able to cognitively draw a lot of connections that he obviously was not able to do 4-5 months ago. He also interacts with us much more than he did as a younger baby. We gave him kisses as a three month old, but he didn't seem to have any particular reaction then.",
