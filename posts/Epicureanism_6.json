        "text": "This is a translation of Statius' *Villa Tiburtina Manili Vopisci* translated by[ A. S. Kline.](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/StatiusSilvaeBkI.htm#anchor_Toc312943208)\n\nAt one who feels the cool air of eloquent Vopiscus’\n\nEstate at Tibur, and those twin mansions the Anio\n\nFlows between, or chances to know that commerce\n\nBetween mutual shores, where those halls compete\n\nTo each detain the owner, the burning dog-star fails\n\nTo howl, nor leafy Nemea’s lion cub, Leo, to frown.\n\nWinter so clings there, persistent cold so overcomes\n\nThe sun, the place never swelters in mid-summer heat.\n\nPleasure herself, her gentle hand, designed it with you,\n\nThen Venus bestowed Idalian unguents on its roofs,\n\nLaved them with her hair, and embellished them with\n\nGrace, forbidding her winged offspring to forsake it.\n\nO ever memorable day! What joys my mind recalls,\n\nWhat a host of wonders to weary the dazzled eyes?\n\nHow soft the landscape, what beauty of that fair site,\n\nBefore art touched it! Nowhere has Nature indulged\n\nHerself so freely. Tall woods overhang swift waters;\n\nThere an illusory image echoes the leafiness above,\n\nA selfsame shadow flees with the far-flowing wave.\n\nAnio itself (wonderful to tell!) full of rocks above\n\nAnd beneath, here calms its swollen rage, its roaring\n\nFoam, as if it were reluctant to disturb Vopiscus’s\n\nMuse-haunted hours, his slumbers filled with song.\n\nBoth shores are home, nor does the gentlest stream\n\nDivide them; and fine buildings occupy either bank,\n\nNo strangers to one another, not parted by the river:\n\nLet Fame boast of Sestos’ bay, those straits Leander\n\nCrossed, those dolphins that the brave lad out-swam!\n\nHere is eternal calm, her tempests have no power,\n\nNo waters seethe. Here sight and sound, and almost\n\nHands traverse; no tidal flood parts us from Chalcis,\n\nNor does Rhegium’s Bruttian shore gaze far across\n\nTo Sicilian Pelorus, separated from it by the deep.\n\nHow shall I start or move my song, how silent end it?\n\nShall I marvel at the gilded beams above Mauritanian\n\nCitrus-wood doorposts everywhere, or bright veined\n\nMarble, nymphean waters flowing in every bedroom?\n\nEyes draw me this way, and mind that. Shall I speak\n\nOf the venerable age of the trees? Or of the courtyard\n\nThat gazes on the river down below, or another court\n\nThat views the other side, towards the silent woods,\n\nWhere all is quiet for you, and the untroubled night,\n\nIs calm or mere murmurs invite to undisturbed sleep?\n\nOr of the steaming baths approached by a grassy ledge,\n\nWhere flames exert themselves against the chill shore,\n\nAnd the river united with a vaporous furnace mocks\n\nThose nymphs panting hard, despite the nearby waters.\n\nI saw works of art, antiques, metals variously crafted.\n\nIt would be wearisome to list the gold statues, ivories,\n\nThe gems fit for adorning fingers, all that the hands\n\nOf artists ever created, firstly in miniature, in silver\n\nOr bronze, and then in conceiving enormous colossi.\n\nAs I wandered, looking round, gazing at everything\n\nI stumbled unexpectedly on riches. Brightness fallen\n\nFrom above over mosaic tiles sending back their glow\n\nDisplayed the shining ground, whose floor delighted\n\nIn pictorial art, new forms beyond those of Pergamum.\n\nI trod fearfully. Why wonder now at mingled roofs\n\nOr those separated by many levels? Or at that tree left\n\nMid-hall, rising through doors and ceilings to emerge\n\nAbove, doomed to suffer the axe under another master?\n\nThough for now some fleeting Naiad or Hamadryad\n\nUnknown may have you to thank for unbroken years.\n\nWhy tell of tables opposite each other on twin shores,\n\nOf cold pools, and the springs in the water’s depths,\n\nOr the Marcian pipeline crossing beneath the river,\n\nIn its bold leaded channel, traversing the depths,\n\nLest Alpheus, that stream of Elis, alone be led beneath\n\nThe waters, on sweet Ionian course to Sicilian haven.\n\nHere Anio himself, leaving his cave and spring deep\n\nIn the night, discarding his grey-green cloak, moves\n\nThe fragile weed, spread across his chest, to and fro;\n\nOr plunges his mass in the stream, and as he swims\n\nSplashes up glassy water. In this shade Tiburnus lies,\n\nHere Albula would wish to lave her sulphurous hair.\n\nThis place might lure Egeria from her Arician grove,\n\nDeprive chill Taygetus of his choirs of dryads, might\n\nSummon Pan from the forests of Lycaeus. The sisters\n\nOf Praeneste might transfer here, should the temple\n\nOf Tyrinthian Hercules cease to grant its own oracles.\n\nWhy laud the twice-fruiting orchards of King Alcinous,\n\nThose boughs that stretched ever-burdened to the sky?\n\nLet Telegonian Tusculum’s and Turnus’s Laurentian\n\nAcres yield; those Lucrine villas, and blood-stained\n\nAntiphates’ Baiaean shore; and the treacherous ridge\n\nOf glassy Circeii, where Ulysses’ wolf-crew howled;\n\nTerracina’s proud citadel, Caieta that Aeneas’s nurse\n\nOwes to her Trojan charge; or even Antium’s shore\n\nThat calls to you when the light thins in rainy winter.\n\nSurely this life allows weighty matters be considered,\n\nHere fecund quiet’s concealed, grave virtue with brow\n\nSerene, sane elegance and pleasure free of indulgence,\n\nSo much so that old Epicurus would have preferred it,\n\nAnd, leaving Athens, have wished his Garden farewell.\n\nIt would have been worth enduring Aegean tempests\n\nTo reach here, braving Capella and the rainy Hyades,\n\nEven though his vessel would have had to pass Malea,\n\nAnd Messina’s straits. Why do we scorn delight nearby?\n\nHere your lyre pleasures Tibur’s fauns, Hercules himself,\n\nAnd Catillus, Tibur’s founder, whom a greater poet sang,\n\nWhether you decide to contest with Pindar’s plectrum,\n\nOr raise your instrument to the mighty deeds of heroes,\n\nOr brandish it darkly, livid with the black salt of satire,\n\nOr with no less care bestow splendour on your letters.\n\nWorthy of the all the wealth of Midas, Croesus, Persia,\n\nHail to your mind’s riches! Should not the golden flow\n\nOf Hermus traverse your flooded fields, and the Tagus\n\nWith its gleaming sands. May you so cultivate learned\n\nLeisure, I pray; every cloud on your heart so disperse,\n\nThat you pass beyond the limits set to Nestor’s old age.",

There is an article [here](http://mo.michelonfray.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/MAG1657_094-EPICURE.pdf) [PDF, in French] where he answers some questions on Epicurus. One of the answers which stood out for me I have translated below. The interviewer asks Onfray to discuss the Garden and how it is a sort of opposite version of Plato's Republic. Apologies for any mistakes in the translation...\n\n&gt;The Garden of Epicurus welcomed everyone: women, children, the young, the old, foreigners, Metics (resident aliens in Athens), and non-citizens. Epicurus thought one did not need to be a young man, a natural born citizen, to do philosophy; as opposed to Plato who selected his disciples to make men of power out of them. Epicurus wanted a happy philosophic community in the city, in part, as a microstate which resists an overly corrupt society. Plato wanted to transform the city in an aristocratic way to create a society in which the philosopher king is placed at the top, while the workers at the base feed the soldiers who prevent the people from bringing down its king… Epicurus is the basis of any future democracy, Plato any totalitarianism: Karl Popper shows in ‘The Open Society and its Enemies’ how the philosopher of the Republic laid the foundations of barbed-wire Socialism in the 20th century. Epicurus is the thinker who has the means to resist all possible totalitarianism… ",

        "text": "There's been a bit of an increase in the number of spam posts the sub is attracting. This could be because of our increased popularity and is perhaps why Epicurus told his followers to 'Live unknown.' To deal with it quickly and efficiently I've setup the automoderator to screen for a few things.\n\nFirst it will pick out submissions that feature certain words. It's a very short list and not of ones which I can imagine a serious post using. But if you have a topic of discussion which you find is getting removed message the mods and we'll approve it. Stoicism is not on the list of banned words.\n\nThe second rule the automod will screen for is that you must have at least 5 comment karma to be allowed to post. This is mostly to stop spammers who create accounts just to post one thing. If however you feel the need to make a throwaway account to post something here message the mods and we'll allow it.\n\nThanks for being so on the ball about reporting things that don't belong. If some spam hangs around too long it may be that we mods have not noticed (reports do not automatically send us notifications) so drop us a line.\n\nHope all's well, and feel free to make any suggestions below.\n\nEdit- The automod has already caught one for me, so unless the sub objects to the draconian tyranny I think it'll probably be kept.",
