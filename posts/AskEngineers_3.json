Currently, the product runs with subassembly arriving on a rolling cart and being pre-built on the cart, then moved to a build station directly beside it, then passing to testing in a sort of linear fashion.\n\nMy question is, what are some tips to look for in deciding a future state cell layout to improve this flow? I can't give specifics, but I am looking more for tips and advice on how to see what I cannot see just yet.\n\n(Also there's no flair for Industrial or anything related, so I was unsure and put it under discussion)",

Hydrogen can also be produced in processes that pollute the atmosphere.\n\nSo, specifically from an engineering standpoint and disregarding any sustainability concerns, why would we choose to use hydrogen over methane?

Could I work under an EE and have that count for my state's ME 4-year requirement needed to sit for the exam, or does it explicitly have to be someone in the same domain for which I am taking the test?\n2.

I'm trying to figure out how big/heavy it should be to work safely. \n\n[**Here's a diagram**](https://i.gyazo.com/892085cdabc27dc9c083364c62258a58.png)\n\nI already have the pole (2\" outer diameter) with mounts secured to it, and I'll be having the base custom made out of steel with a collar welded to it that the pole will be secured into. \n\nThe question is how big/heavy the base needs to be. Current design reflects an 18\"x12\" base that will come in at around 45 lbs with this thickness metal (3/4\"). \n\nWill this be sufficient?\n\nOther info:\n\n* The bottom bike will be around 22 lbs and the top around 16 lbs. I can try to always ensure that there is a bike on the bottom (i.e. when I take the bottom bike out, I'll temporarily put the top one to the bottom so it's not top heavy).\n* I do not want to (yet) secure the pole to the wall. I know this will be helpful, but I'm not 100% on location within the room so I can't secure it to a wall. It would be ideal for the freestanding weight to be sufficient for it to have good balance.\n* The heights of the racks on the pole are adjustable. I can have the bottom bike nearly touching the ground to keep the weight as low down as possible.\n\nI think that's all I've got for now! As the title states, any way to determine what the size/weight of the base should be for this to be sturdy? There will be no kids around, no dogs bumping into it. Stationary and left alone.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Half or more of American home energy consumption is used on heating and cooling (including stuff like a water heater and refrigeration). I calculated a 14cubic foot deep freezer filled with water and frozen could store ~45kWh of \"cold energy\" at minus 32F (80% of that energy is stored in the phase change at that temp). A similar ish volume of paraffin wax stored in a heat pump water heater -esque device could store about 30kWh of heat energy, with most of that energy stored at 150F in the phase change.\n\nA 13kWh Tesla powerwall costs ~$7k. I understand that with a good AC and heat pump you might could expect 4 times that amount of energy in cooling and heating, like 52kwh of cool/heat. But even if a deep freezer doesn't have a lot of power or that high of a COP, and a heat pump water heater has half the volume of the deep freezer. They're still only ~$200 for the deep freeze and ~$2k for the heat pump water heater (I assume it'd be relatively cheap to expand the volume) for the same equivalent heat &amp; cool capacity. If you just use those thermal batteries to heat your house and water, and cool your house and the area around your fridge. The loss in efficiency seems negligible if not nonexistent. The system also seems really cheap to expand, and could allow you to get away with battery storage half as small.\n\nI can't find anyone whose done something similar to this.

We are building a cart for a warehouse with a 250 lb capacity for a customer asking for the same tubing specified in two different types on two separate documents. They are asking for the structural tubing of the cart to be both AISI 1020 steel and now ASTM A500. \n\nThey said the A513 steel isn't load-bearing, so they need A500. From my searches, A500 is load-bearing for much heavier applications, such as pedestrian bridges, not 250 lb capacity carts. We were then told by a steel vendor that AISI 1020, which they call out as the material to use on their prints, is A513 and not A500.\n\nMy guess is that they googled A513 when we sent that note and saw it isn't \"load bearing,\" so they told us we needed A500 instead. The material they're now asking for, A500, has long lead times that the customer doesn't like, whereas the A513 we use regularly and have inventory on hand to get moving.\n\nAm I far off in my background? We are spending a lot of time and resources chasing down alternative vendors to seek a shorter lead time, and I now wonder if we have been wasting our time when A513 is more than sufficient.",

I didn't get a job due to multiple reasons-\n\n1. I lost interest in electrical engineering and can't imagine doing even 1 day of work in power sector. Most of the available electrical engineering jobs in my country are power sector jobs. I couldn't move to a better country with better job opportunities due to family problems.\n\n2. I want to get a software engineering job but I don't know what should I do. There are so many options, so many areas to specialise in to get a job but I don't know which one to pick. I only know basic c++ and java. I know it will also be difficult to land a job in software engineering with electrical engineering degree.\n\n3. I have chronic depression, cptsd and attempted suicide multiple times. I thought I would kill myself years ago but have failed. Last 2 years I spent watching tv shows on my laptop everyday. I spent some time searching jobs online and applied to like 30 places but no one called.\n\nI know my situation looks like probably the worst case you ever seen. You might ask why I am not on the streets homeless by now, I am still living with my parents and depend on them for everything. All I can feel is shame and guilt for being so helpless.\n\nI know how competitive the job market is and no one in this world wants someone like me when they can have a fresh graduate with much better skills than me. At this point I am completely lost. I have even given up applying because I don't know what to say if the interviewer asks about my 2 year gap. \n\nShould I just give up at this point? It's becoming humiliating to keep living with my parents anymore and without a job I might as well kill myself.",

I don't plan to risk my house and livelihood by recklessly overheated charging appliances.\n\nWhen I charge my car overnight, in a wall socket (240 V nominal, rated up to 16 A), my charger allows me to set the charge current to integer amp values between 5 and 13 amps, and the display shows the instant voltage across the wall plug.\n\nFor example, if I plug the car but do not charge, the voltage may sit around 235 V. When I start charging at 5 A, the voltage will drop to 232 V and stabilize. If I then raise the current to 8 A, then the voltage drops to 228 V.\n\nSince this is a thought experiment, let's assume all those readings and settings are exact and stable, and the power factor of my charger is 1.\n\nCan I interpret that, at 5 amps, the heat dissipated by the cables between breaker box and charger plug is (235 - 232) * 5 = 15 watts?\n\nAnd furthermore, if I raise the charging to 8 amps, the cables will dissipate an additional (232 - 228) * 8 = 32 W, for a total of 15 + 32 = 47 W?\n\nCan I also estimate the resistance of the house wiring to be around (235 - 228) V / 8 A = 0.875 Ω?\n\n(Things I do realize: * in the real world, there would be hot spots at the junctions, e.g. the plug itself would get hotter than the surrounding wire. * The power factor may not be exactly 1, leading to some additional current on the wires that my charger would not know about. * The Joule law would be the obvious way to calculate energy dissipated as heat via I²R.)",

It's got a copper heat spreader on top. Let's go ahead and assume all 10W is being transferred through that copper plate on top. The goal is to get a 80C temperature difference between ambient and that copper plate. Enter the TEC/Peltier.\n\nI've been looking at some beefy TEC datasheets. For example, the Sheetak  SKHC1-199-08-T100-SS-TF00-ALO on Digikey. What I'm confused about is in these performance curves:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/GBIxxoA](https://imgur.com/a/GBIxxoA)  \nWhat doesn't make sense to me is how the delta-T is calculated when you have a heat load. Don't you need to include the power consumed by the TEC when looking at Qc? For example, when there is 0 delta-T, if we look at the 8A current line, the voltage is 18V (bottom curve). So the TEC is pumping (18V\\*8A=144W) to maintain 0 delta-T, which seems to be confirmed by the top curve (the 8A curve at 0 delta-T looks to be at about 144W). But then as we increase delta-T, Qc drops. Wouldn't we need to be pumping MORE heat, in addition to the TEC's power consumption, to get a delta-T?\n\nOr does the Qc curve not include the power consumption of the TEC? So if I wanted to keep the cold side of the TEC at ambient, I could theoretically cool a \\~144W device?\n\nCan anyone help me clear up my confusion here? I know there's more to these calculations (thermal impedances between interfaces, heatsinks to air, etc) but I'm just trying to grasp the basics here.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/11ky89e/making_electrical_cable_neutrally_buoyant/",
        "text": "I have asked a similar question sometime ago on this subreddit, but back then it had conflicting and confusing requirements, so I simplified my use case a lot. Basically I am building an underwater exploration robot (ROV), and I need to make a cheap, neutrally-buoyant communications tether. The tether will be 100m long, and the ROV will descend down to \\~60 meters (6 bars). I have simplified the tether requirements by using PLC modules that allow me to use just a simple 2 wire untwisted pair cable (I tested it and it works). Specifically, I am using [H05RR-F 2x0.75mm\\^2](https://www.tme.eu/Document/92cf43669f9638e0c2132196e74fc922/H05RR-F-2X0.75-EN.pdf) cable, which is strong, flexible, water-resistant and quite cheap (60€ for 100m). It is the best I could get for this kind of money. The only issue is that it sinks in the water, and now I need to fix that. Here are specific requirements for adding flotation:\n\n1. Cable has to be neutrally buoyant (neither sink nor rise) at any water depth, regardless of pressure. Any buoyant material that gets crushed under pressure is a no-go. Changes in water temperature and water salinity are negligible, as their effect is minimal. **This is the most important requirement**. The cable cannot under any circumstances have positive buoyancy at shallow depths and neutral/negative buoyancy at deeper depths. It must be neutrally buoyant at **any** depth.\n2. Cable weights 61g per 1 meter, and has a volume of 30 ml, meaning I need an extra 30 ml of volume per meter to achieve neutral buoyancy.\n3. The cable has to be uniform and smooth throughout it's length - meaning, no spaced out floats. This is important to reduce drag as the cable is towed by the ROV, and to minimize risk of it getting caught on obstacles.\n4. Cable must remain reasonably resistant to scratching or tearing - it might drag along rocks or some debris. It should also remain as flexible as possible.\n5. I can spend as much as 50€ for this buoyancy solution.\n\nTo save your time, here are some usual suggestions which I already tried and found they don't work:\n\n1. Pipe foam insulation, pool noodles - gets crushed under pressures of around 2-3 bars and loses buoyancy, also absorbs water over time.\n2. EPDM foam - also gets crushed.\n3. Neoprene tubing - way too expensive, also difficult to get in just the right size to have just the right amount of buoyancy needed for this cable.\n4. Non-sinking polypropylene rope - turns out, it is mostly buoyant because of air bubbles trapped between rope strands, which get crushed under water pressure and lose buoyancy.\n5. Threading cable through a garden hose / aquarium PVC tube - I tested many different hoses and tubes, and found that ones that have walls thick enough to withstand pressure without imploding are to heavy and stiff. To achieve enough buoyancy the final diameter becomes unacceptably large.\n6. Using thin walled PVC tube or heat shrink tube over the cable, and replacing air with low-density oil to prevent implosion - requires even thicker tube to reach neutral buoyancy, so much that it becomes unacceptably stiff. Also, water pressure squeezes the parts of the tether which are deeper in the water, pushing the oil to the shallower part of the tether, where it bulges.\n\nSo basically I am looking for a cheap, low-density, flexible material that doesn't absorb water and doesn't get crushed under pressure, that can be attached to/over the cable along it's entire length.\n\nI would very much appreciate any additional suggestions. Sorry for a long post, just trying to save your time so you don't suggest something I already tried :)",

        "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI'm a mech eng student currently working on a plastic extrusion project and am trying to make a system for safe motor operation. I've attached my one line diagram [here](https://imgur.com/a/l16l8WE); not sure if I did the MCB and NC switch connection correctly so please advise if I'm wrong. I've included all the details for my setup including the amperage and cable calculations below. I would like to know whether all the wiring, chosen components, and calculated currents have been done correctly.   \n\n\nThe first item on the list is the motor. It is a 3 phase 0.1kW 200-220V geared motor purchased from [here](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/221000596555/?CategorySpec=00000125501%3a%3ab%09unitType%3a%3a1%0900000125503%3a%3a202210060455518211046787%0900000125509%3a%3ai%0900000125504%3a%3amig00000001569014&amp;list=PageCategory).  \nI have calculated the current consumption through I = W / (V x 0.7 x 1.73) = 0.41 Amps  \nWhere 0.7 is the assumed power factor (motor vendor did not provide datasheet). Cable going to the VFD was determined using this [table](https://imgur.com/a/L4BrcYb) (three 14 Gauge cables, about a meter long each). \n\nThe VFD itself is purchased from this [site](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/drives_-a-_soft_starters/ac_variable_frequency_drives_(vfd)/micro_vfds/cfw100a01p6s120g2). Datasheet states that the rated current is 1.6Amps so I chose to go with a 14 Gauge for this as well. \n\nThird component is the [MCB](https://ideallink.idealsupply.com/products/3SQM9F42315/description?cf=ChannelSight&amp;cstrackid=c53d8970-ba05-4232-907a-f53bd5898668). I calculated the total power consumption for the VFD and motor (0.28kW) and used the same equation above to get the total current consumption I = 1.93Amps. Multiplying by 6 to account for inrush current to get 12A. Choosing a 14 gauge cable once again, I calculated the percent voltage drop through  \n%Voltage\\_drop = 1.73 x Current x Cable\\_Length x 100 x [Cable\\_Impedance\\_per\\_ohm\\_meter)](https://imgur.com/a/asAp5lf)/Voltage\n\nand ended up getting a value much smaller than 3% hence concluding that a 14 gauge would do just fine. Note that I used 0.95 and 0.8 power factor which resulted in 0.14% and 0.2% respectively. \n\nLast on the list is the NC switch which I'm planning to buy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Baomain-Button-Switch-TBSP-330-Phase/dp/B01KLS09NI/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=three+phase+nc+switch&amp;qid=1678159477&amp;sprefix=%2Caps%2C65&amp;sr=8-14). \n\nOne final thing to note is that I'm situated in Canada but I've been told that our labs have sockets rated at 200V so input voltages won't be an issue. \n\nI think that covers everything, sorry if this was a long post. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this setup.",

        "text": "So my understanding had always been that there are ways to lighten a length of steel with minimal loss to it's stiffness but the heavier length containing more steel would always stiffer. For instance, an H-girder will have a more efficient stiffness-to-weight ratio than a heavier solid bar but the solid bar will itself be stiffer. However, I've just been speaking with someone who claims to have calculated that a hollow tube can be 0.3x the weight of a solid cylinder while also being 2.8 times stiffer. Is this calculation right?",
