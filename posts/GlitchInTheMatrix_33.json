        "text": "My grandfather had a farm, he lived there with my grandmother and uncle. During the school holidays as kids my sister, brother and myself would catch a 5 hour bus out to the country to spend time with them.\n\nThey had three sheep dogs and since there were three of us our grandfather would just tell us that we all had our own sheep dog. When sheep dogs would die from old age they were replaced before we ever came back so we never had to deal with the loss, the old dog would just be gone and replaced with a new puppy.\n\nAs they ran a farm they had a ute (utility vehicle). The dogs would jump into the back and, when prompted by my grandfather or uncle, jump off the flatbed and round up sheep. When we stopped into town after seeing the livestock we should clip the dogs collars to leads on the use so they wouldn't jump off.\n\nOne day when I was around 6 years old I remember that my particular sheep dog, Arch, was on the back of the ute when I went outsid.  I remember calling for him and he jumped off to greet me. \n\nTo my horror though, Arch had his collar clipped on and proceeded to hang himself off the side of the car. I tried to help but couldn't, screamed for my uncle who ran outside and unclipped the dog, saving his life.\n\nI'm 26 now and spoke to my uncle about all the past farm dogs and we spoke about Arch. My uncle told me that unfortunately Arch jumped off the ute and hung himself. I told him I remembered that and Arch was saved, by him.\n\nWe discussed the memory. The car was in the same place, the dog died the same way in the same spot. The weird part is that I wasn't even there. He was absolutely certain we didn't come down during that holiday as it was too busy a season to watch over us.\n\nStill have no idea why that memory is in my head but it never happened to me.\n\nTL;DR: my dog died while I wasn't there but I have a memory of it happening with a different ending of him being saved.",

I clearly remember getting there  after my nephew Julian was born. I remember sitting in the room on the far side of the bed watching the door talking to my sister her boyfriend and or older sister. Her boyfriends mother came in the room, she was dressed in scrubs and a gray hoodie. I remember her being really odd; staring my sister down and mumbling under her breath \"black trash\". I remember my sister was so tired and it took her half a second to realize what was said. She had had a C-Section and was still hooked up to an i.v. drip and some machines (she has MS) and I remember the look of shock and anger pass her face as she tried to pull up in the bed and stand. I remember grabbing her arm and her boyfriend grabbing his mother and yelling that she needed to get out of the room. I remember everyone trying to keep my sister calm and her boyfriend yelling at his mother in the hallway. I then remember making my way to the hallway to find her boyfriend pacing back and forth crying. I intentionally say remember several times in this because to this day, they swear I wasn't there when this happened. They all agree to the timeline. The people who were there including my wife (who was out of the room with my mother at the time) remember the event, yet every one of them claim that I was out of the room when this happened and none can say where I was in the Hospital when it went down. The only other person who remembers me in the room is the mother. And that bitch is crazy.",

I went to take a shower, and when I was done I took the jacket into my bedroom.\n\nSo I got into the bedroom, cleaned up a little bit, and then went to get my phone out of the jacket... Except it wasn't there. I was positive I hadn't moved it. I checked if it fell somewhere in my closet, on the bed, on my shelf. Nowhere. But I could have sworn it was in my jacket pocket- so I picked up the jacket again, and checked the pockets. Empty. I went and checked the bathroom. Nope. What the hell. I came back to my room, and put the jacket on to properly reach into the pockets- that is how confused I was. Still empty. Ugh, dammit. I took off the jacket and threw it on my bed.\n\nI looked around once again, but no luck. Apparently I spaced out and moved my phone somewhere. I picked up the jacket one more time, to throw it in my closet. I noticed it felt slightly heavier than it did a minute ago. But that's impossible, so I shrugged it off.\n\nI threw the jacket into the closet, and heard a loud thud when it hit the wall. WTF? I got the jacket back out, reached into the pocket... and pulled out my phone. It was really weird, and I have never had an explanation for it.",

I remember we were all talking about random stuff, classes, women, etc. We are just passing the workout complex and crossing a field to this old bridge that we have to cross to get to the store. As we are just about to the bridge, this old 70s era black truck pulls up to the walking path and stops. We keep walking, but something feels off. I try to see the driver but the windows are completely dark and that this driver isn't even on a road, it is just perpendicular to the path, waiting. My friends are still talking and I say \"should we wait for the truck to go by?\" They look at me and keep walking without responding. I follow my friends past the ruck as I stare intently at the glass, but could see no one. I keep walking about ten feet or so and turn around, but there is no truck or tire marks. Just the path. I run up to my friends and say \"where is the truck?\" They look at me and say \"what truck?\" I am freaking out a little bit now and half yelled \"the one we just passed down by the bridge\". They all look at me like I am crazy. I shook my head and went and got some snacks and approached my friends again and asked about it. No one saw a truck; just me. A black 70s era truck with obsidian black windows is my glitch in the matrix. I have no idea what it could have been or why it was there, but I never saw it again.",

Then, out of nowhere, a wedding portrait that my grandma had hanging up in her room just kinda jumped off the wall (there was a loud thump and we went in there and it wasn't on the wall anymore). More recently (probably like 3 or 4 years ago), the same sort of thing happened. Me and 2 of my brothers were home, and at this house, the walls were covered in pictures and framed drawings and stuff. I was standing in the kitchen making food and a picture of my sister jumped off of the wall by my door. It was a semi-open kitchen (no wall behind the sink and dishwasher), so I watched it happen. No one had been slamming doors or hitting the wall or anything in either situation. Are there any explanations for things like this?",

Upon landing, I realized that it was time to get my haircut, and a quick yelp search brought me to an eccentric little shop along Colfax ave.  It was a bit of a distance from the house I was staying in, but definitely worth the walk. As I was heading home along Colfax I stumbled into a huge record store, and as an ardent music nerd I decided to check it out.\nI came across a decent cassette rack and found a tape of Pod by The Breeders for $6, and decided to buy it. As I was walking home I popped it into my walkman and zoned out through the first 2 or 3 songs. Down Colfax was a long walk, and at one point I forgot where I was going, remembering vaguely that I needed to turn right on Josephine. Realizing I was a bit lost, I decreased in pace, stopping gradually at an intersection. As soon as I stopped, I found my tape ending on the third song, which faded out with feedback as well as some distant studio chatter. I managed to discern the words of one of the members who said \"Josephine, do you think you're going bald?\" And as I turned my head I realized I was standing right at the intersection of Colfax and Josephine. A weird and pointless coincidence, I took it as the universe helping me out. But it still strikes me as strange. Thought I'd share. Thanks for reading.",

No big deal, I thought, probably just meant for the previous tenant. I took it inside and left it on the kitchen table, intending to take it to the post office the next day to see if they wanted to forward it. It ended up getting buried under some paperwork, so I forgot about it.\n\nLast week, I was in a car crash. No one was hurt, fortunately, but still pretty jarring. (Also, I was not at fault)\n\nToday, I found the letter again while cleaning. I was curious if I could find the guy to send it to online, so I search his name. Nothing conclusive comes up, so I look into the return address. There was no name, so I just searched for the address. First (minor) surprise: the return address was an abandoned building in a business district, advertised for rent for the past few months. Second surprise: **the building was on the corner of the intersection where my car accident occured.**\n\n**EDIT:** Pretty boring conclusion, guys. I read the letter, and it was just a loan agency saying they were preparing to sell the guy's car that he left as collateral. ",

Her answer was somewhere along the lines of \"It's BerenstAin Bears, of course,\" followed by details about how she loved the books AND the show, yada yada. What was interesting though, at least to me, is that she said that when she was in elementary school she remembers everyone calling the bears by the BerenstEin last name, and was confused because she remembers it clearly being spelled BerenstAin. Further, she said there was a girl in her class with the last name \"Berenstain\" and she was convinced at this point that the Berenstain name was actually pronounced \"BerenstEin,\" and she would therefore pronounce this Berenstain girl's last name the wrong way, resulting in this girl getting annoyed and correcting her all the time.\n\n\nSo tl:dr, my girlfriend remembers it being spelled BerenstAin, while everyone around her misread and mispronounced it.\n\nEdit: words\n\nEdit #2: [link for those out of the loop](http://www.vice.com/read/the-berensteain-bears-conspiracy-theory-that-has-convinced-the-internet-there-are-parallel-universes)",

It definitely happened - not only I but my whole immediate family remember it very well.\n\nWe had just moved into a new house and both me and my mother had noticed that very quiet music seemed to be coming from the beds. So far as I know, this is not necessarily unusual in itself - some materials have been known to pick up radio waves. I did not recognise the music, but my mother did - she was absolutely certain that it was Pink Floyd. I had never listened to any Pink Floyd at the time.\n\nSeveral weeks after she told me this, during which time the music continued intermittently, we scraped off the old wallpaper in my brother's room to find, painted underneath it in foot-high letters, \"Pink Floyd.\" There may have also been a simple drawing of a whale, but I'm not sure about that. The music continued for some time afterwards, but did eventually stop.\n\nBest 'normal' explanation I can come up with is this - if the previous occupant was such a fan of Pink Flloyd as to paint their name on the wall, they presumably often played their music. Perhaps some materials are able to remember sounds and continue reproduce them. Any physics people know if this possible?",

I finally realized it was merely that this second kid just reminded me of the other one, same build, same Irish red-almost-blonde hair, same temperment, same personality. For all intents and purposes, in my mind, this was really the same person. \nIt goes beyond the sensation one might get from looking at a grouping of say, fraternity brothers. You might have a hard time telling fraternity-sweater-wearing-caucasian-20-year-old-who's-father-is-a-lawyer # 1 from fraternity-sweater-wearing-caucasian-20-year-old-who's-father-is-a-lawyer # 2, but something in the back of my head refuses to accept that these are two distinctly different people.\nIf anything in this world could ever convince me that it is some sort of simulation, this would be it. I can almost accept that there are only a certain number of \"real\" people in the world, and the rest are merely variations on a template, using the same procedural rules that say GTA V or the Sims might employ. \nI half-heartedly mentioned this to my significant other, who responded with joking about taking certain medications. She had no idea what I meant. That is, until the other day when we were driving through downtown, and saw two businessmen, same powder blue button up shirts, same black belt with silver belt buckle, same patent leather shoes, same sunglasses, standing next to each other on the curb. Now she is starting to see the same thing too. ",

        "text": "In 2008 me and my boyfriend had an awful argument that lasted all night, at around 5:30 in the morning we decided that we weren't getting anywhere and exhausted from the lack of sleep and the intense fighting we agreed to go and get some coffee and drink it in a near by beauty spot with a great view overlooking miles of beautiful patchwork fields.\n\n\nWe get the coffee and are heading to the spot, when we somehow take a wrong turn and end up on a gorgeous little street that neither of us knew existed and looked like it had come right out of TV show about the middle classes in the 40's, it was so lovely that we decided to park there to drink our coffee.\n\n\nMy boyfriend then comments that we are the only car on the whole street, I said it was probably because the drives of each house were at the top of a pretty steep bank and we just couldn't see their cars, he then said what he actually meant was there were no cars driving through the street, I hadn't given it much thought, but he was right.\n\n\n\na few moments later an old style milk cart came up the road and stopped, we watched a milk man wearing the old white hat and coat combo (something I've never seen in my time and I'm 30) get out and walk up a set of steps to a house, as he was up there two horses came galloping from the same direction as the milk cart and ran around the street as though that is perfectly normal.\n\n\nWe watched with out mouths wide open as the milk man came back down the steps and didn't even look twice at the horses. The whole thing was plain weird, each garden of each house was beautiful and filled with flowers and the doors of the houses looked clunky and old fashioned.\n\n\nWhat bothers us to this day is that we have lived here all our lives and never knew that place existed, we are both familiar with most streets in our city, having large families and lots of friends. We haven't been able to find that street since even though it was only just over a mile away from our house at the time and we just can't figure out what on earth happened.\n\n\n\nWe sat there for a whole 20 minutes, maybe more and we have tried to come up with a number of explanations, we were tired, maybe we never even went for coffee and fell asleep... but how does that explain dreaming or hallucinating the same street for 20 minutes! It still confuses us so much to this day. If anyone has any kind of explanation it would be more than welcome, for as long as we were there neither of us remembers seeing a street sign too so it's not as though we can just look on google maps.",

Once I get to the end of the street, I look both ways like any sane driver, and once I check and make sure its safe, I get ready to turn. Right after I start to press the gas, I hear a loud horn, and look and see a semi truck heading towards me (there's no way I could've missed it, because the street I was turning from was the only other way onto the street, besides an entrance about a half mile down).\n\nSo I slam on the brakes and give the driver a \"what the fuck\" look, and once he goes by, I make my turn. I see the truck turn at the end of the street, and I reach the corner about 5ish seconds after. And, the truck is nowhere to be seen. There's no vehicles larger than a van in front of me, and there's nowhere he could've turned into in such a short span of time.\n\nSo there's my glitch story. Not as glitchy as some other stories on here, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless.",

        "text": "Never really found a reasonable opportunity to talk about this experience before. So it's a bit of an old story that seems relevant now. It happened back in my first job; I was just wrapping up high school, so there was a little bit of juggling necessary for my work schedule (Not in the US; work hours down here can be less malleable) - What I managed to find at the time was a helper position in a supermarket chain, doing all of the minor busywork of packing clients' delivery orders and running errands for cashiers and basically being a clueless kid near the storefront.\n\nHere the work hours come into play - because I couldn't swap hours due to my school time (at night), I instead kept the same work hours and switched around teams. Instead of moving to the closing shift, I'd continue to work the opening shift with the other group. This is relevant because I spent 2 months in the opening shift and worked with just about all of the storefront staff for at least 1 week, minimum.\n\nCome my third month there, and one perfectly ordinary morning I was packing orders as usual. I glanced at the clock in the wall and saw it was about 9:10, turned back to my work and in a blink I was all the way on the other end of the store. I paused for a moment, looking around for anything out of place and saw nothing that stood out; a few blinks and inquisitive looks later I looked at the clock again and it was roughly around 9:25. So, glitch number 1 - hopping over 15 minutes.\n\nNow, for glitch number 2, I have to add a disclaimer that I don't know if I noticed it on the same day or on subsequent days - It's been a good few years after all. But certainly during the week after the time lapse I noticed my manager looked different. She was a tall blonde that could almost qualify for the adjective of slender; then suddenly there was a equally ranked manager that was a stocky brunette with a distinctive scar over her nose and mouth. This was odd, I had never seen the black haired one before - and remember, I had worked with everyone on that sector's crew. I spent a few days observing things and trying to locate an explanation, but I haven't found any. And the original assistant manager that handled things when the actual manager was with the other half of the crew was *still* there as usual. So, no one disappeared, for glitch 2 I only, somehow, spawned an extra boss.\n\nFor glitch 1, I can discard passing out or spacing out like a drooling zombie standing on the middle of the store. Those would have drawn attention and no one ever mentioned noticing anything odd at all that day. If they saw weirdness, it wasn't any higher than my usual weirdness. Therefore, I don't know how that time lapse came to pass. I may just have blanked out any memory of the period, or slipped into some form of trance or meditative state accidentally or all sorts of increasingly ... eccentric theories.\n\nFor glitch 2, I did my share of investigating the circumstances. There was no manager on sick leave or mid vacation. I did work with all teams, she hadn't been hired just then and was, to all intents and purposes, a longer time employee than I was. For all the eccentric theories I could come up with for this one, there's a fairly grounded one that could cover it in Jamais Vu. I can't be fully certain of what it actually was, though. \n\nI haven't really forgotten the experience, and I don't remember finding it disturbing or distressing. It just serves to show me that absolutely unexpected things can happen. And no, I haven't been able to replicate glitch 1 since then.",

The best way to do this I suppose is a quick Google search of both of them.

Not TOO strange, but it does make one take note; after all, 'Daniel' being a not uncommon name, but how many of them use the full name and not a shortened nickname (Dan, Danny, etc).\n\nThere is another man in the office named Jason; his counterpart in another office location is also named Jason. We have a travelling employee based out of our office also named Jason. Again, no nicknames - J, Jay, Jase, etc - all go by the full first name.\n\nWe hired a travelling employee named Larry, and within that week had calls about the job opening from two other men named Larry. All three were named specifically 'Larry', not a shortening of Lawrence.\n\nTwo women that I work on projects with, who are based in another location, are named Diane and Lyn. Lyn is a shortened version of a longer name, but she spells it specifically 'Lyn' and not 'Lynn', as is more common. Two women I worked on projects with at a previous position were named Diane and Lyn.

My cat was in my bed-drawer. Kinda weird. I have no idea how he got there. \n\n(Cat Story#2): the old townhouse I used to live in had a door, that also had a screen door in front of it. Well that same cat was lodged between the door and the screen door one day. How on earth he got there? nobody knows.\n\n(Cat Story#3): This one is important because my cat HATES the outdoors, hell when we moved houses and picked him up to put inside the car, he peed all over my mum cuz he was scared. Basically I was eating something in the kitchen and I hear my cat meowing like he just saw his family die. I look out the window and hes rubbing against it begging to come back inside.\n\n(TV story): now here's where it gets creepy. I had a small tv in my room that was completely flat on a table, no cat or gust of wind could've lifted this thing off the table. But when I got home, It was face down on my carpet on the floor. NOBODY was home, we were all out, and it's puzzled my brother and I ever since. weird stuff.",

        "text": "I have spent a good portion of time on this side of reddit,  freaking myself out over all the stories of unexplainable occurrences happening,  never once thinking it would happen to me and then what do you know.  This morning I experienced my very own glitch in the matrix.  So,  a couple of days ago my boyfriend and I got a new puppy. As you do with all new animals,  you take extra precautions and ive pretty much not taken my eye off this pup since we got her. This morning as my boyfriend and I were getting ready for work I noticed that I left our front door open.  Our front door is huge sliding glass door that fills out the front of our house.  I made sure little pup was right behind me when I closed the door,  keeping my foot in front of her so she couldn't run out.  Success.  Door closed,  pup inside.  Then,  about a couple of minutes later I was running about doing my business getting ready for work when I heard a huge bump and a shrill yelp.  I thought,  silly pup she must've thought the door was open and tried to run out but then when I looked over at her,  there she was standing still on the other side of the door,  outside with the door shut,  just as I left it.  I was frozen still staring at her with her staring back at me like we both couldn't believe what happened. My boyfriend heard the thump too and looked over,  also in disbelief.  I just wish I had an explanation for this to keep my mind at ease but literally I haven't been able to think of anything all day.  Well and truly freaked out. ",

I traveled to Austria for spring break with my German teacher and a few students so we could visit Vienna and Salzburg. While in Salzburg we did the Sound of Music tour. \n\nSo I'm sitting on the bus listening to the guide talking about the movie and the history of Salzburg. At one point he was explaining to all of us about one of the scenes in the movie. After talking for a minute or two he repeats word for word what he had just said. Confused I looked around to see if anyone else was reacting as I had, but everyone (about 25-30 people) were happily listening and taking pictures as if everything was normal. Nobody but me seemed to notice that the guide had literally said the exact same info not a minute earlier.\n\nIt was a weird moment and I tried to justify it by saying I was tired from traveling a lot, but after discovering this subreddit I'm not so sure anymore.",

DM is one of the few remaining elementary schools that still runs from k-6. MP however ran through k-5. One thing I remember is the 5 grade teachers at MP were Mrs. P and Mrs. M. I only remember seeing them once or twice during my time at MP. Until one time I got in trouble in 4 grade and got sent out to Mrs. M's classroom. In her room were 2, maybe more kids I'll later meet. One is a kid at DM, a sixth grader when i was a fifth grader I remember seeing in the hallways of DM. The other one was in my fitness class at the middle school most DM kids transfer to, who was an 8 grader while i was a 7 grader. Here's the part that really freaks me out. Mrs. M and Mrs. P will be the 6 grade teachers at DM. I'll later have Mrs. M for 6 grade. Mrs. M seemed to have more modern clothes, and seemingly weighed less at MP. Another weird thing is at MP they had 4 teachers for every grade, except 4 and 5. \nIn third grade, there were multiple kids that later go to DM, but for some reason I can only remember one. I never spoke to any of them at MP, except for one kid who I'll call Valentine. At MP I remember him distinctly saying \"Hi, I'm Valentine\" and that's it. All the time I see Valentine, and I talk to him quite frequently. But all the time I wonder who he is, who I am. Are there more kids that I've met but just don't remember? Valentine claims to have been at DM for all his life. If any of you know how to look up old class records I will gladly do it. And I don't remember if Mrs. M had been teaching there for long. Any help?\n\nEDIT: I forgot that one time when I was arriving back at DM Valentine introduced himself to me while we were hanging out with friends and I didn't remember his name. He said \"My names Vallentine, I think I told you but you just forgot\" Maybe he was referencing my k-2 years, but its still weird.",

My boyfriend and I then went to the basement of my grandmother's as the background was distinct (wooden walls all around), that part seemed very prevalent.\nThe next day on Wednesday I went to a friend of mine's home and on the kitchen counter a plate of mozzarella, tomato, and basil snacks were lying on a plate. Weird. My friends and I went to the basement of his home (it was my first time there) and it had the exact wooden walls in my dream?\nAnother instance was when I had a dream my friend called me and said that a friend of ours was having a party in Delaware.

        "text": "My best friend and I were both 16, driving around in the backwoods of Mississippi well after dark. We weren’t doing anything nefarious. No drinking, no drugs, just driving around recklessly like 16 year olds did in the late 90’s when gas was under $1.00. \n\nWe had made it our mission to drive every single inch of road in our entire county before we graduated high school. Not all in one night, but over the next 4 years, not a single stretch of federal, state, county or city road would be left untouched. \n\nOn this particular night, we were driving dirt roads in the county, and as 16 year olds tend to do, we were driving a little too fast. We were in his 1988 Ford Mustang listening to bad 90’s rap music (Ditty by Paperboy) we’d recorded on a cassette tape. We turned a corner and to our shock, the road came to an abrupt T. We were going way too fast to avoid blowing through the stop sign. Thick forest flanked every side of the road. There was no saving us, we were going to hit a thicket of trees and die. We left the dirt road, the car jostled about and abruptly died. Everything went black. No music, no headlights, no sound of his Mustang engine, just total silence.\n\n We sat there without saying a word for what seemed like half an hour. We finally looked at each other and my friend managed to stammer with total seriousness, “Did we just die?” I didn’t know how to answer because the last image I saw before the headlights went dark was a fast approaching grove of trees only a few feet in front of the hood. It felt like we should have died. \n\nI eventually asked him to try and crank the car or see if the lights would flip on. To our amazement, it cranked right up, the lights came on, and before us lay a road that followed a hill along a slight incline. At the top of the hill was a faint light. Instead of following the road, and the light, my friend threw the car in reverse and we drove away terrified. \n\nWhy were we still here? Why hadn’t we hit a tree? Why hadn’t we hit multiple trees? Why had we both seen the road end? Were we ghosts? Maybe we’d died and we were given the choice to either follow the faint light into the afterlife, or turn around and roam the earth as lonely desperate 16 year old ghosts for the rest of eternity. Before giving any of this much thought, we’d already left a trail of dust on our way back to civilization.\n\nWe drove around our small southern city for an hour before finally returning to my family’s house. This entire hour was marked with the constant question of “are we dead?” “are we ghosts?” “would we even want to know if we were dead?” “should we ask someone?” \n\nWe walked inside, sheepishly, and I managed to ask my dad with total seriousness “Can you guys see us?” My dad, a gruff, grounded type of guy looked back sharply and said “What the hell are you talking about?” \n\n“Dad I think we died.”\n“What the hell are you talking about?”\n“Dad we might be ghosts.” (by this point I knew we hadn’t died, but it was always fun to see my dad lose his cool at idiots, even if we were the idiots.)\n“What the hell are you talking about?”\n\nThis type of back and forth went on for a while as he grew increasingly frustrated. We told him the story and he got a little angry that we seriously considered at one point that we might have died.  We answered the cursory questions about drugs and alcohol with adamant “nos”. \n\nHe believed us and we went on our way, alive, but confused. The next night we drove out to the place of the incident. It looked exactly the same as the last time we had seen it. Instead of a coming a T, the road followed a hill along a slight incline. At the top of the hill was a faint light. \n\nThis time, since we knew we wouldn’t be following a light into the afterlife, we drove the hill to see what was at the top. Anticlimactically enough, it was just an old country house with a big red barn. It wasn’t a tunnel of white inviting us into whatever comes after you die in a car wreck at 16. \n\nI don’t know how to explain a road that appeared out of nowhere. This wasn’t some fever dream. This wasn’t a bad mutual acid trip by two 16 year old idiots. This actually happened. There were trees reaching out for our car. Our lives flashed before our eyes. There wasn’t a road, until there was. I don’t know how to explain any of this. \n\nTo this day we still occasionally joke around when we see each other. \n“Dude, do you remember that time we died?” \n“Do you remember that time we were ghosts?”\n",

        "text": "I'm going to try and make these as short as possible.\n\n1. This happened in high school. A friend of mine was grounded, but his parents had left to church. This gave us about two hours to hang out before they got back. He picked me up in his dad's van and we drove to the corner store to buy some beers. We were drinking in the van outside the store, when he spots his parent's car on the street. They were arriving earlier than expected. \"Oh shit they're going to see the van and come over here!\", my friend worried. All of a sudden, the lights at the corner store went out. We were covered in darkness. His parents drove right past us and as soon as they left our line of sight the lights came back on. My friend had the biggest grin on his face. We couldn't explain it, so we just laughed it off. It was weird because the lights only went out at the corner store and not at the other stores in the shopping center and we weren't drunk either, we both were drinking our first beer.\n\n2. I'm driving down the street smoking a joint (I'm an experienced smoker with a high tolerance, so no I wasn't just high). It has four lanes. Two on each side of a strip of grass or whatever you call that middle thing that separates ongoing from incoming traffic . I'm getting the munchies, so I turn back to stop at the Jack in the Box I just passed up. You can't do u-turns on that street, but I say fuck it. As I'm turning, I see a cop car coming my way in the opposite lane. I turn my headlights off. Then the weird shit happens, the street light goes off on my side of the road. I'm still turning, but I'm in the other lane now on the opposite side and almost on cue that street light goes off too. Like the incident mentioned before, I'm covered in darkness. I complete the turn and look in my rear view mirror and spot the cop. He's minding his own business. I got away once again. I cannot believe my luck. I might have not even gotten pulled over regardless of the street lights, but it was still an exhilarating moment. \n[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/aqcIkNp.png) a shitty map of the street in case you got confused. \n\n3. Shopping for my mom's Christmas gift at the mall. I decide to buy her a cool tea pot at this store called Teavana. I remember the atmosphere being real happy and joyful in there. Everyone had a big smile on their face including the gay guy who was helping me at the register. I also caught this cute girl dancing behind the counter and we both laughed when she found out I was looking. Like I said, it was a real cheerful atmosphere in there. So anyways, I'm paying for my teapot and the guy mentions that the register/computer just shut down out of nowhere. He said it's the first time it's happened. Nervous laughter ensues. After a few minutes pass by, the register starts up again, I pay, and get out of there not thinking much about the register shutting down until a couple days later. \n\n4. It's December, but I'm fiending for some ice cream. I go to Baskin Robbins and buy me a sweet strawberry cheesecake ice cream cone. As I'm paying for it, the register shuts down again.  This guy also mentions how it has never happened before. OK. Coincidence maybe? \n\n5. Couple weeks later. Go pick up some material for my fence company. I pay with credit and have to sign on one of those electronic signature pads. Give my signature when the salesman goes, \"Wow this thing has never worked this well before. I can see your name clearly. Usually, it's barely noticeable or it doesn't show at all.\" He was dumbfounded. He kept looking at the pad and the signature almost in astonishment. I found the whole thing slightly funny and thought like damn, am I carrying too much electricity or something?\n\n6. Last one. So it's February now and I have to go to court to pay a misdemeanor ticket. I get called up to the judge, sign some papers, and when they're about to print some sheet they were supposed to give me, their printer suddenly stops working. The secretary got the printer working again, but for some odd reason it didn't want to print my paperwork although it was still printing everyone else's papers just fine. They told me they would just send it in the mail. I was kind of hoping they would forget about it and I wouldn't have to do any community service, but that wasn't the case, unfortunately. \n\nI will note that during that period of time I was going through a lot of emotional stress. I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but anyways I just wanted to share the anecdotes with you guys and see what you all think. ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/3c0ken/collection_of_very_strange_glitches_throughout_my/",
        "text": "First, I'll stat off by saying I'm very glad I found a place where I can submit what I've encountered, and discover I'm not the only one to experience such things!\nNow, these are things VERY un-explainable to me, and I've tried debunking most of them for years. Anyway, here are the glitches that I can remember.\n\n1.Spongebob Episode, about 13 years ago: The first glitch I'm going to talk about is an episode of Spongebob. It was when I was a kid, and I remember it was being shown on Nick for the first time, as the commercials for it always said it was a a new episode. So, I watched it. It was the episode where Spongebob tried to make Gary take a bath or something. \nThe only problem?\nI remember seeing that episode like years before it aired that day. I SWEAR I remembered the episode, and I even remember the part where Spongebob dressed like a pirate to get Gary to bathe. It was so weird. Even as a kid this bothered the hell out of me. I remembered this glitch from reading the thread about the Embarrassing Christmas Party photo (which I too remember there being a photo a the end of the episode).\n\n2. Playstation Disc Glitch , about 4 years ago : So, this is the first time I had ever considered something a 'glitch', because it was so weird I never could explain it in any other way. So, I would play the game Resident Evil 4 on my PS2 Slim all the time a few years ago. I would also leave my PS2 on all day long for days at a time. It was just a system people could do it with without any repercussions. Basically how my room is set up, the PS2 was connected to a small TV sitting on one of my dressers. That dresser has a mirror attached to the back of it. Basically, I was standing looking into the mirror, close to my PS2. I remember just looking at the mirror while flipping a thing of deoderant in my hand, to see if I could flip it in the air and catch it upright while not looking at anything but my eyes in the mirror. I know, I was bored and I was in the middle of getting ready so I know how dumb it sounds lmao. But anyway, I dropped the deoderant eventually during a throw. I didnt see it happen, but I heard the deoderant smack the top of my PS2 slim. Anyone who has a PS2 knows how specifically they sound if they are moved around or hit.\nBasically, I heard that smack and was hoping that by the time I looked at the PS2 there wouldn't be crack in the lid (The PS2 was the model the had the disc reader's lid pop up as a thin lid to open it and put a disc in). By the time I looked over, I was baffled.\nInstad of any damage, I saw my resident evil game disc OUTSIDE of the PS2, SPINNING on top of the CLOSED DISC TRAY LID. What the fuck?How did the game get outside of the PS2? When you take a PS2 game out of a pS2, it usually leaves a frozen screenshot on the screen, with music still playing. It did that for me here too, and the game was spinning as if it just got popped right off the PS2 disc reader. It was as if the deoderant hit the PS2 so hard, the disc just evaporated through the top. This wouldnt be so weird had the lid just opened,but the the lid closed itself, with the disc directly ontop where it wouldve been inside the PS2. Any explanations? I specifically remember thinking after that jokingly to myself: \"Did I just see a glitch in real life?\".\n\n3. The endless 3 Way stop, A few weeks ago: A few weeks ago I was out in my car, driving around my neighborhood cruising a joint. Now let me just say, I know a lot of people will try to discredit my story because I was 'high', but let me be honest here. I am an experienced user with weed, so I wasn't extremely baked or anything. Besides, the effect of marijuana don't seem new or foreign to me, so I can guarantee that being under the influence had zero impact on what happened. Anyway Im cruising the joint, and I'd say about 300 feet ahead of where I was there is a three way stop, T-Bone intersection style. Im coming down the stem part of the T, if that makes sense. I see a truck on the right stop sign, with a young business-looking man inside. On the left I see and old woman driving an SUV, and then there was a car behind her with no one I can see clearly. Now it takes me at least 5 or 6 seconds to drive all the way to that stop signs, and the entire time I'm thinking \"Are these guys confused as to who has the right of way? Why isn't anyone turning?\". I finally get to the stop sign, where I wait an additional few seconds. I look up at both parties, assuming I'm going to see anger or confusion on their faces as to who  is supposed to go, but all I see is the business man looking forward, not moving. Then I look to the left at the grandma, looking forward, not moving. I wait a few more second really creeped out, and eventually, I just go and turn right, going passed the businessman. I look in my back mirror as I'm driving away, and no one is moving at the stop. I  give a second glance halfway down the street, and I see the business man start to move on his way. Either this was just a huge coincidence, or something really fucking weird happened.\n\nAnyway, those were my stories! Please discuss the huge treasure chests of stories I put together for you! And just so you know, none of these are fake. It was hard enough to get myself to type all this, and I DEFINITELY wouldn't do all of this for bullshit stories. Thanks for reading!",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/3bpbb9/seeing_an_imaginary_friend_as_an_adult/",
        "text": "Kinda long. So here's the TL;DR: Ran into my imaginary friend as an adult. I think he might actually be real, and possess supernatural abilities.\n\nI always had a very active imagination. My mom would go along with it, letting me eat breakfast on the moon, or inviting my imaginary friend to dinner.\n\nJohnny, my imaginary friend, was a pretty cool cat. For a while I thought he was real, but when I noticed no one ever laughed at his jokes or answered his questions, my budding mind concluded that he was magic.\n\nActually, magic isn't too far off. Johnny just knew things. He knew what I was getting for Christmas, or my birthday. He foresaw my parents' divorce and promised me that, when I moved to the next school, I'd meet a cool kid named Josh. As always, Johnny was right.\n\nAs I got older, I saw less and less of Johnny. I saw him standing at the back of my first middle school band concert. He wore a big grin, showing his admiration and acceptance. The next year, when I was 13, he emerged from a circle of students at a school dance, pointed at a girl, and gave me the thumbs up. After the dance, she ended up being one of my lifelong friends.\n\nI think the last time I actually spoke with Johnny, or interacted with him physically, I was 8 or 9. The last time I saw him was the day I started working at a fast food joint a few months before my sixteenth birthday. I caught a glimpse of him walking out the door. I didn't see his face, but I recognized his gait and that 90s denim jacket he always wore. My heart fell. I knew that now, I didn't need him around, and so he was going to move on. The way he walked out, without showing his face, was its own powerful goodbye.\n\nFast forward. I was twenty-one, living in Guatemala. I had a vivid dream about a part of the city I had never visited, and of knocking on a particular, distinctive, blue door. I knew I had to go there, today, and headed that way without even eating breakfast. Sure enough, the dream was true to life, and I \"recognized\" the street, even though I had never been there.\n\nIf you've never been to Central America, there are these little shops that people run out of their houses, called tiendas, all over the place. When no one answered the door, I turned around, looking for a place to buy some water. There was a tienda right behind me, and there, peering through the bars, was Johnny.\n\nIt took me a minute to place the face, because it was not Johnny's boyhood face. He looked about my age, still wearing the same denim jacket. He didn't say anything, but just watched me and grinned.\n\n\"Johnny?\" I asked, after I regained my bearings.\n\n\"Hey linchpyn,\" he said, and the old saunter was in his voice. \"Que pasa?\"\n\nThrough the bars of the tienda, we performed our secret handshake, and Johnny extracted a cold bottle of water from a refrigerator against the back wall.\n\nHe told me he was just there to check in on me. He congratulated me on what I had accomplished thus far. He made some predictions about how my life would turn out.\n\nI had forgotten that this was my imaginary friend, and started chatting with him like a real person. We bullshitted for a while. He told me about going to college. I asked why he was in Guatemala, and he told me that he had married \"the most beautiful girl in the world.\" She was a Guatemalan, and they were on vacation to visit her grandparents.\n\n\"Can I meet her?\" I asked.\n\n\"She's at the market. Just a second, I'll grab a picture.\" \n\nHe disappeared through a doorway at the back of the tienda. They're usually just a single room on someone's house, so you can walk back into a living room or kitchen or whatever. I knew it was goodbye, but I still called out to him. A Guatemalan woman shuffled through the doorway, responding to my call. She had never met Johnny.\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment, I noticed my wallet lying on the counter, forgotten in the morning's haste. I looked back and forth between the water bottle in my hand and the forgotten wallet on the counter. This seems obvious, but I'll spell it out: if I couldn't buy the water from the tienda, who had given it to me besides Johnny? I couldn't have reached the refrigerator through the bars. Did I just stand there, talking to empty space, for twenty minutes? How could I know what that street would look like, having never visited it before?\n\nEven more eerily, the predictions Johnny made about my future have come true. He told me my belief system would change immensely, and I have since left the religion of my upbringing. He told me I would get married in 2008, which I did. He said if I ever did divorce (he intimated that this could go either way), I would play in a relatively popular band, and even get to do some touring. After my divorce, I did play in a band that did some small tours in about a dozen states. He promised that my career would grow, and someday I would take a high position at a company. I'm a CTO, and am in high demand in my field. He said I would suffer dramatic physical injuries, but that these would not have a serious impact on my lifestyle. I've broken dozens of bones, and a few required surgery. After one of these, the surgeon, with sad eyes, informed me that I would never regain the use of my left hand, but it is 100% functional.\n\nOther predictions, like that I would live to old age, be the progenitor of a large and illustrious family, and publish a best-selling novel, could probably go either way. I have no idea what the future holds.\n\nI just want to see you again, Johnny. I want to catch up like we did that day. I still remember every word, can play back the whole scene like a movie in my mind's eye, but it's not enough. I know so much more now, and there are so many things I want to ask you.\n\nTake it easy out there, buddy.",

Some backstory:\nA few months ago my girlfriend had a dream in which she saw our two children (who do not yet exist), a girl aged 5 and a boy some years younger. Their faces were slightly blurry so she was unable to pinpoint details about their facial features. I found it creepy but didn't think too much of it.\n\nLast night I had a dream in which I saw our daughter (who does not yet exist) aged around 1,5/2 ish. She had curly dark blond hair. \n\nWhen I recounted this to my girlfriend her face turned pale and her jaw dropped. She said our daughter in her dream also had curly dark blond hair. We had a collective moment of \"WTF\" and got an eerie feeling. My girlfriend is not pregnant.\n\nDoes anyone here have similar experiences? In that case, did the details you saw match up? Thanks for replies in advance.",

I preface this by saying I'm a fairly normal dude living a fairly normal/boring life.  Nothing weird ever happens and anything remotely weird I can explain away with something logical and convincing no problem. \n\n**The Situation:**\n\nAnyhow, I get ready for work and as I'm getting dressed I go to my small closet and grab a pair of socks.  They were soaking wet.  Hmmm, strange.  Okay I grab another pair.  Soaking wet.  I go through the pile and sure enough all of my socks were wet and most of them were *soaked*.  I don't mean wet like \"oh you forgot to throw them in the dryer\" wet.  I mean soaked as in \"you take your socks and dunk them in a bucket of water\" wet.  How could this be?  I smelled the socks but I didn't really detect any 'odd' smell.  They don't smell like urine or greasy or anything.\n\n**The Closet:**\n\nLet me describe the layout of my closet briefly.  I keep my pile of socks on top of a little plastic, 3-drawer bin that sits in a small corner.  This bin sits underneath a bunch of hanging clothes.\n\n**The Weird:**\n\nGiven the location of my socks, one would think that water has somehow dripped down on them from above or something.  Okay fine, except all my hanging clothing above my socks were bone dry.  The walls were bone dry.  The ceiling was bone dry.  The floor was bone dry.  There was *no evidence* of any water anywhere else in my closet except for those dang socks.  I literally have no explanation for this.\n\n**The (partial) Rationalization:**\n\nSome other helpful information: I live alone.  I rent a place.  Given that I rent a place, maintenance is allowed to enter my residence without notification if time does not permit.  Okay fine.  So we know that someone *could* have accessed my place.  The closet has an access panel to the attic that I was told a maintenance person would potentially use should a situation require it.  Okay fine.  So we know of a rather reasonable scenario where someone could have come into my house without me knowing in a situation that would place them in the same spot where I keep my socks.\n\n**But that still doesn't explain the central question:  Why were all of my socks, and just my socks, wet??**\n\nI need help.  Please advise.",

I knew there wouldn't be anyone coming in to the restaurant and the thought crossed my mind to call in and see if I really had to go in since it was such a disaster outside. I would never actually do this though, when I have a job I don't make excuses, call in sick or anything like that, so I never actually called.\n\nI get to work and the bartender was there getting set up. She's like I can't believe you called and asked if you had to come in. It completely caught me off guard, I told her that I didn't actually call in and she said she talked to me on the phone and it was most definitely me. I checked my phone later on to see if there was an outgoing call, thought for a second that I might've been losing my mind but there was no outgoing call. ",

As I am walking casually to the nearby track I start to smell skunk, which is not unusual around my area, so I look around to see if I can find the road kill. I spot it about a block ahead in the middle of the road. This road is a few blocks off of the main road, so it's not very busy but does get some traffic. The houses around this area have large front lawns and very few cars parked near the curb. \n\nSo I see the dead skunk, no big deal, and continue onwards. I look down for no more than *two seconds* to skip a song on my phone, and as I look up again I see the skunk has disappeared. On the sidewalk adjacent from where the skunk had been, was an old and very overweight Indian lady wearing a traditional green sari. \n\n\"Whoa, wtf\" I think to myself looking back and forth between her and where the skunk was. She had nothing in her hands. No sign of road kill on the road. No garbage bag/can around for her to dispose of it and as her age/weight indicated...I didn't understand how she could get to the sidewalk -&gt; to the centre of the road -&gt; back to the sidewalk and dispose of the skunk all in under two seconds. \n\nI could not explain it so I gave her a smile and went on my way. \n\nThe glitchiest part was noticing the distinct pungent, lingering smell of skunk had completely disappeared along with the dead skunk. \n\n**tl;dr: Dead skunk in the middle of the road seemingly turned into an old Indian lady on the sidewalk. Smell suddenly disappeared.** ",

        "text": "When I was a junior in high school, my mom took me to the east coast to visit colleges. We were on the train to I believe Poughkeepsie one night and we were just standing, chatting with a couple local New Yorkers on their way home from work. \n\nWe were standing next to the bathroom, so we frequently had people standing with us just waiting to use it. One man, an average guy with a briefcase (not that that's unusual, it's just all I remember) entered the bathroom and shut the door with a *whoosh, click*. A minute later, a woman came over to use the bathroom and waited with us while the man was in there. Now if you've seen a train bathroom, the door is a) loud and b) facing one way. So this door was facing us. \n\nFive minutes pass, then ten, then we all start wondering aloud what's taking so long. The woman who was waiting asked if we were sure someone was in there, and about five of us said yes, we all saw him go in, and none of us saw or heard any sign of him leaving. Five or ten more minutes pass and we're starting to worry about the guy. Maybe he fell or had a heart attack or something. So one of the men who had seen him enter knocks on the door.\n\nNo answer. \n\nHe knocks again.\n\nNo answer. \n\nHe tries the handle. The door slides open despite having almost definitely been locked, and the bathroom is *completely empty*. No man. No briefcase. No sign anyone had been in there since we saw him go in. \n\nWe all took turns going into the bathroom, baffled, and looking for any sign he was there. There were no other doors, not even a window to the outside, and the only air vent was tiny. There was no way he could've gotten out without someone noticing. Eventually we just had to let it go and let the people waiting use the restroom. But the five or so of us who were standing there all agreed on what we'd seen and that there was absolutely no explanation for what just happened. \n\nIt feels like I turned a movie off right at the edge of a cliffhanger and the curiosity is KILLING me, even now, years later.",

I was sorting through some stuff in my room and needed another storage box to fit in some papers, so I went into our storeroom to get one. There were 3 boxes that were already folded (those are carboard boxes you have to fold yourself, consisting of the box and a lid) and one unfolded. One of the folded ones and the unfolded one had the same pattern. The folded boxes were lying around on a stack of random stuff while the unfolded one was lying on top of the unfolded lid in a shelf.\n\nSo here comes the glitch: I take two of the folded boxes (the ones that didn't have the same pattern as the unfolded one) with me, but later noticed I also would need a third one. My mother was going in our storeroom anyway, so I asked her if she could get me the unfolded box that was still in there. From the storeroom she said she couldn't find the unfolded box, so I looked for it myself, and she was right, it wasn't there, only the unfolded lid was still there. On top of that the lid from the folded box was missing aswell, so there was just the folded box and the unfolded lid left. I started looking through the whole room, but I couldn't find the missing box anywhere.\n\nSo, is this just my brain messing with my perception or a glitch in the matrix?",

I wanted a name for at least one of them, so, I picked the first name to come to mind, and thus, named this [hypothetical prisoner Dave who, with his cellmate, intend on breaking out of prison during the night by tunneling through the plumbing network underneath their cell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/38qawk/the_last_line_of_defence/crxiuy5) Wrote it, posted it.\n\n\nLittle did I know... 5 hours prior to my writing of the above story (and 2 hours before the news first reached the public), it was discovered that an [actual prisoner named Dave who, with his cellmate, had broken out of prison during the night by tunneling through the plumbing network underneath their cell.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/convicted-killers-escape-n-y-prison-article-1.2248902)    Even the way these pipes *look* have an uncanny resemblance in color &amp; size (assumptions of scale) to those in Prison Architect.\n\nNow, I've seen a boatload of weird coincidences in my life, but never until today has one thrown me for such a crazy loop as this one has.  I *instantly* understood why these are called \"glitches in the Matrix.\"  I always thought the term was *just* a fun play off The Matrix,\"  just a fun way to label real-life borderline paranormal/hyper-coincidental events.
