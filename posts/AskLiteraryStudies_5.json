Want to know how I perceive them now 40+ years later verses back then. I would like to find one short story I read back in early high school days but now can not find. Here is what I recall of the short story.\n\n* Told by a young boy from his view point.\n* It is he and his mother and I believe a younger sister.\n* The father had passed away and left them in desperate times financially and otherwise.\n* It was in the late fall and then into winter time.\n* The mother would weave baskets I think, then send the boy to town to sell them and buy very specific things off a list at the store and return home.\n* The winter passed and they survived. However the mother was pregnant (not disclosed before ) and gave birth to a new baby. The short story ends here I believe with the relief winter has passed, a new baby to the family, and the feeling the worse was over and they would survive.\n\nThat is the general line of the story, but I could have some details in error here.  I wish to re-read this, but my search so far has not found it. It was in a book of short stories we received in school so I assume someone here has to know it. \n\nThanks in advance.",

This perplexes me, because I can't know if I should go trying to find \"better excuses\" for studying literature, or learn to make do with loving to read, write, study and teach it.  For the former, it is sort-of useful for readers like me and for some authors; for the latter, it is immediately useful to me as it can render me happy and peaceful, but the question whether my work has any use outside of pleasing me would erode that happiness and peace quite quickly.\n\nI guess what I experience is probably somewhat common among our part of the humanities, so maybe you could help me sharing your thoughts or talking a bit of similar personal experience?

Probably there are three levels of consciousness. But in the writing, there are many more levels if the writing is any good, and this is where the reader starts reading his own book because the better the writer, the more he's sunk into his material, the more there are things in it that he's not aware of at the moment of writing.\" - The portion I'm interested in is the idea, which I've heard before but never gone into with depth, of the reader reading his own book. Can anyone point to a critic or writer who has explored this? Can anyone make sense of the experience? As in the work of art being that of the reader have no barrier - perhaps the end all be all experience of being in someone else's head. I don't mean the John Gardener \"continuous dream\" experience. I think in the Naipaul sense, he might mean that it's not an experience one is \"having\" --more what one is creating as the sentences enter one's brain, as the narrative or non-narrative accretes. A simultaneous experience - the book tracks and catalogues the readers life and they ingest it.",

The post was titled \"A not-so-veiled Metaphor\", and was a short story about a customer trying to purchase a TV. At the first store, the shopkeep does not advertise prices and insists that the customer place an offer on the desired TV to start negotiations. After some back and forth, the customer gets tired of negotiating and goes to another store to buy a TV for the advertised price.\n\nAfter posting, I received some rather unexpected backlash from a host of users insistent that my story was not a metaphor at all, but rather an analogy. I had expected some backlash based on the content, but I honestly never thought the metaphor vs analogy debate would be so controversial.\n\nI was told my story was not a metaphor because there needs to be a statement saying something is something else. I contended that implicit metaphors are perfectly valid, and that you see them everywhere (Animal Farm, The Road not Taken, etc.) The customer and shopkeeps were metaphors for fantasy football team-owners, trying to strike a deal to purchase a TV, which was a metaphor for an NFL player.\n\nI was then told my story was not a metaphor because metaphors are limited to words or phrases. I contended that extended metaphors were perfectly valid, and oftentimes stretch the comparison over a number of sentences or paragraphs. \n\nThe main argument for this being an analogy was that I was drawing a comparison for the purposes of explaining a concept. To which I replied that I had not drawn any comparison, I implied one with metaphors, but never once mentioned fantasy football.\n\nAfter many haughty words, I'm just genuinely curious who was right, and I'm curious where you guys land on the debate. \n\nPS.: I think the most proper term would have been allegory, but that was dismissed as well.",

The most I could gather from a bit of research was the omnipresence of triangles relating to femininity, and I feel like I barely scratched the surface. There are so many names that are references to historical/mythological figures, and all the use of poetry that I just don't get... I feel like there must be so many subtle intentional details that I'm missing. \n\nSo I guess what I'd like to read is a detailed breakdown of any themes or subtext or anything else about the lore of the game that isn't readily apparent, sort of the way one would analyze literature. Does anyone know of a resource like that? Maybe a blog by someone who analyzes modern media, where I could request this game? Or a Redditor who has played the game and wants to take a crack at it?",

        "text": "I have just started reading Georges Bataille's 'Literature and Evil'. In the first section he discussed Bronte and *Wuthering Heights* after establishing that 'literature is communication'. I follow (or at least I think I follow) his growing definition of Good and Evil and I sort of understand what is meant by literature being a 'return to childhood' in that it is the innocent and spontaneous and therefore incapable of Evil (which enjoys or pursues bad acts for their own pleasure/premeditation). What I am struggling with is what Bataille means by 'sovereignty'. Initially it seemed obvious that it was just a sort of synonym for an individual's separation from others that necessitated communication and therefore literature. However at the end of the section on Bronte he writes:\n\n \"An honourable human being loyally accepts the worst consequences of his challenge. Some-times he even goes out to meet them. The 'cursed share' is the gamble, the risk, the danger. It is also sovereignty, but sovereignty must be expiated. The world of *Wuthering Heights* is the world of a hostile sovereignty. It is also the world of expiation. Once the expiation has been accepted, the true smile of life appears.\"\n\nI was honestly stumped by 'sovereignty must be expiated', I know I could keep reading and suffer through the ambiguity but I'm worried that I am missing something really obvious/essential in his early discussion of Evil that would make sense of the last part of the chapter.  \nSorry in advance if this is a weirdly specific question, I have tried googling but have had little luck.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Is trying to empathize through literature racist? http://speculative.sunygeneseoenglish.org/2015/05/01/the-repressive-effects-of-empathy/ \"Saidiya Hartman’s discussion of empathy in “Innocent Amusements,” from her book Scenes of Subjection provides a really interesting lens through which to examine Lauren’s hyperempathy. Hartman studies the letters of an abolitionist named Rankin who endeavored to, “reenact […] The grotesqueries enumerated in documenting the injustice of slavery and intended to shock and to disrupt the comfortable remove of the reader/spectator,” in order to, “rouse the sensibility of those indifferent to slavery” (Hartman, 17, 18). Hartman cites Rankin’s explanation for the rhetorical moves that he makes: “We are naturally too callous to the sufferings of others, and consequently prone to look upon them with cold indifference, until, in imagination we identify ourselves with the sufferers” (Hartman, 18). Rankin’s theory is predicted on the idea that, “pain provides the common language of humanity; it extends humanity to the dispossessed and, in turn, remedies the indifference of the callous” (Hartman, 18). The really interesting move that Rankin makes is to, “literally narrat[e] an imagined scenario in which he, along with his wife and child, is enslaved” (Hartman, 18). Hartman claims this as a way in to seeing the, “difficulty and slipperiness of empathy” (Hartman, 18) Harman’s main concern is perhaps best highlighted in the following quote: “Rankin begins to feel for himself rather than for those whom this exercise in imagination presumably is designed to reach. Moreover, by exploiting the vulnerability of the captive body as a vessel for the uses, thoughts, and feelings of others, the humanity extended to the slave inadvertently confirms the expectations and desires definitive of the relations of chattel slavery. In other words, the ease of Rankin’s empathetic identification is as much due to his good intentions and heartfelt opposition to slavery as to the fungibility of the captive body.” (Hartman, 19) Hartman argues that such exercises in empathy reinforce the violence inherent in making black bodies into objects. She explains that this move, “fails to expand the space of the other but merely places the self in its stead” and she further problematizes a move which, “requires that the white body be positioned in the place of the black body in order to make this suffering visible and intelligible” (Hartman, 20, 19). Further, Hartman repeatedly refers to Rankin’s positioning as a “fantasy”—a term which not only identifies it as an imaginative process but is also rank with the implications of pleasure (Hartman, 18). Hartman claims that there is a certain aspect of, “sadistic pleasure to be derived from the spectacle of sufferance,” (Hartman, 21). Hartman repeatedly references the terrible violence of chattel slavery as a spectacle and points out the, “thin line between witness and spectator” (Hartman, 19).\"",

In the poem, after a series of questions and analogies, the poet concludes that his soul was stamped by a creative artisan, that it is a part of God. \n\nSo, chronologically, Naimy precedes Sophie's World by years, so it is possible that the book took the quote from that poem, but I don't really think so. Why? Because A) From the book, I don't get the feels that the Norwegian author is really that knowledgeable about Arabic culture, let alone a less-than-famous poem by Naimy. B) My intuition just can't accept this idea.\n\nWhat I want to ask is, to sum up, whether there is some common work that both Naimy and Sophie's World quote..

Additional readings on the mentioned topics are extremely welcome.\n\nSo anyway: In the 5th chapter of Portrait, Stephen begins to refer to his soul in a feminine context. Later in the chapter, Stephen claims that 3 things are needed for beauty in art: Integritas, Consonantia, and Claritas (Wholeness, Harmony, and Radiance), or rather, Aquinas claims that and Stephen agrees. Is it a coincidence that Joyce attributes the soul in feminine terms, and also defines beauty with 3 Latin words of female gender classifications? \n\nThis is where I am having some contradictory thoughts on the topic: Throughout Chapter 1, the binary nature of childhood is explicit: On/off, hot/cold, dead/alive, in/out. In fact, it seems that Stephen's entire childhood is expressed in binary terms. Later, in Chapter 4, Stephen defines religion in binary terms as well - You either have Grace, or you do not. You are either a Virgin, or you are not, Good/Evil, heaven/hell, etc. However, during the 'bird girl' epiphany, Stephen abandons the binary perspective for one significantly more gradient, which I understood as Stephen escaping the binary, restrictive nature of the Church.\n\nIn Chapter 5, Stephen's world view has expanded and matured. He no longer thinks of things in a binary, duelist way - except that Stephen's soul, and the souls of others are expressed in feminine terms. Then shortly after, he defines beauty in art in feminine vocabulary. Does anyone have any thoughts or insight on these passages?\n\nI'm also having trouble internalizing what Joyce is trying to say about the duelist, binary nature of his world. It's clear that Church and State can be reduced to binary functions - like virginity, one is either a patriot, or they are not. Another question I have is this: How does masculinity and femininity relate to the binary, duelist world that Joyce paints for the Church and the State? Is this binary nature of the universe something that is inescapable, even for Stephen? Are there any publications specifically about Joyce's binary descriptors in Portrait that I could read? \n\nIf this is simply too broad a topic for discussion, lets restrict it to just the 1st question I raised about the female Latin words used and Stephen's description of his soul in feminine terms.\n\nLong post, sorry.

Part of the reason, I think, is because the first-person narration is written in a way that feels like the narrator is a person I might have met at a bar that is telling me a story. I don't know how to explain it other than it feels less \"formal\" than many other books written in first-person that I have read. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for other books or short stories that are written in this... more \"intimate\" way?\n\nI should also mention that I really like Southern Gothic and Weird fiction (Thomas Ligotti, Lovecraft, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance!",

He says it is a Dark Lady. \n\nAlso... I completed a Queer reading on the poem in which I claim that the speaker takes a polyamorous view of his lover. My professor refutes this, saying that, since the subject of the poem is not a male, that the Queer reading is invalid. I'm actually not sure that he knows what \"Queer\" fully means, even though I attempted to explain. We live in a very conservative part of the country. Regardless, does this seem to be a reasonable interpretation? I'd be willing to share my full analysis, if needed.

I'm interested in the subjects we discuss, and work hard in class to get to understand them better. The feedback on an essay I wrote and on the seminar I led (by posing questions and guiding the class discussion) were both clear: my understanding of certain issues, especially the one of racial controversy, is not sophisticated enough. \n\nI figured that this is because my general knowledge of the United States at that time is lackluster. I don't know much about the time period, and I would like to get to know more. I have no clue where to start however. The amount of information out there is so big.. I feel like I'm not able to see the wood for the trees. Can anyone do me suggestions on what the best place to start would be? Also regarding the black-white controversy.. any good sources on that?\n\nI would also really appreciate it if someone wanted to look through my essay with me, in order to determine what exactly is lacking in my understanding of racial controversy. My professor pointed out what was wrong, but I feel like she did not really explain how I could improve on it.\nIf anyone wants to help with this, I'll send you the essay through PM.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated &lt;3\nConnor",

Part of my coursework entails writing a comparison between two texts and I have recently finished reading Goethe's Faust which I am fascinated by but not sure what to compare it with. We have to chose a particular angle and I'm interested in the philosophy/mythology side of things as well as how Faust is presented as a tragic hero.The play is obviously quite lengthy and densely packed so I would need something equally weighty so my essay is balanced. My teacher suggested I try Hamlet due to it's philosophical themes of suicide etc. I haven't read Hamlet yet (plan to!) but have read Macbeth and also think that their might be considerable potential for comparison (both involve a deal with black magic, men with tragic flaws etc). Anyway my question is whether anyone here thinks that Macbeth, Hamlet or any of Shakespeare's tragedies would be a good comparison. I think I'm good at being perceptive but I don't want my links to be contrived  If not \\- are there any other texts that spring to mind as an interesting comparison with Faust (I'm not afraid to get my teeth into something difficult)?Thoughts or suggestions for further critical reading would be much appreciated. \n\nThankyou :)",
