        "text": "So I went on 4 dates with this guy and cut things off after our last date. \n\nHe called me a b-tch (2 or 3 times) and a c-nt once, as a joke. I told him not to call me that but he just shrugged it off. After our date, he texted me and I explained to him that I was very disturbed by his jokes. He apologized but at that point I already ended things in my mind, and I felt that I was even being too nice by giving him some explanation before blocking him. See details below...\n\nSome things that struck me as being a red flag:\n\n- He was pushing for exclusive dating from the 2nd date, pushing for commitment by the 3rd date. Covertly though. I never slept with him. He made comments several times about me being \"guarded\". I told him repeatedly that I wanted to take things slowly and he seemed a little bit annoyed (once again, covertly) that I wanted to take things slow.\n\n- He said he usually dates 2 kinds of women, younger women who don't know who they are/what they want, and women his own age who are desperate for a relationship. He claimed both didn't interest him, yet he met me and by the 2nd date was pushing for exclusive dating. I found this to be a major red flag. I think it's a red flag when a guy makes broad disparaging statements about women when he is the common denominator.\n\n- On our 4th date, in the same hour or two that he called be a b-tch &amp; c-nt 3-4 times, he told me he was romantic and asked me if I was romantic. I found this behavior to be very Jekyl &amp; Hyde-esque. \n\n- I had gone on a hiking trip with my cousin the 2nd weekend after the week we met. Literally 5-6 days after we met. He brought that up on our 4th date and passive aggressively accused me of not actually having been on that trip. Covertly. He made it sound like a little joke. \n\n- Besides these few incidents and the innocuous push for commitment (because it's desperate for a woman to push for commitment so early, but when a man does it you're expected to feel flattered!) he was cordial the whole time. He even tried to keep paying for all of our dates, which I refused to let him do, because I didn't want anyone to feel they have some \"upper hand\" over me. Which is why I have to ask this question on Reddit, to make sure I'm not crazy or neurotic. Besides calling me names as a joke, everything he's said or done was very covert.\n\n- This one might be petty/me being paranoid... when he put his arm around my shoulders he was either throwing all of his weight onto me (or has a very heavy arm), or was purposely trying to be forceful. I found this a little frightening. I've gone out with muscular men before and no one ever made me that uncomfortable by putting his arm around my shoulder. \n\n- This last one might definitely be me being paranoid - he wanted to walk me home but I called an Uber. He even said \"what you don't want me to know where you live?\" as a joke - in fact, yes, I don't want you to know where I live. \n\nNeedless to say, I ended things after the 4th date and I'm creeped out enough by him/think he's inappropriate enough now that I felt the need to block his number. I saw small red flags since the 2nd date but almost all of this happened on the 4th date- strong hints for commitment, calling me degrading names as a joke, accusing me of lying, etc. I think he was getting impatient/his mask was falling and/or he was escalating with the goal of testing my boundaries.\n\n\n",

        "text": "For context, I'm 17, male, and trans (which lead to me getting kicked out by my mum about a year ago).\n\nBefore I left home, I was doing terribly; my grades were falling, I was depressed, constantly anxious, and overall wasn't coping at all. But when I got kicked out, after some minor turbulence (friends screwing me over, temporary homelessness, etc) I was doing fairly well. Now I'm living in a 'foster'-esque environment; a family has taken me in as their son, all I have to do is pay board and do my chores and stuff. But even though 80% of my issues have cleared up or at least lessened, I have major issues with my foster mum. I know shes a good person and would never hurt me, or anything, and she really cares about me, but I get really anxious around her. My guess is that she reminds me of my mum too much (50s, assertive, female, christian, not really keen on the whole gender thing*, etc) and it makes sense- I'm the same with pretty much anyone else who ticks a lot of those boxes. \n\n(* Despite not believing in gender dysphoria, she uses my preferred name and pronouns and everything, but shes really pushy with her 'your gender is caused by your trauma and how controlling your mother was' and I respect her opinion but she brings it up a lot and uses my 'sexism' as an excuse (I don't have any issues with people dressing how they're comfortable, but because my internalised transphobia is so bad apparently I'm a giant sexist because I don't feel comfortable wearing 'feminine' things and would rather be an ugly guy than an average looking girl) and seems convinced therapy is gonna make me cis/'god made you a girl for a reason')\n\nBut it's starting to be detrimental to her mental health; and I feel unbelievably guilty about it. I'm trying really hard to act more naturally around her, but usually I either:\na. shut down and externally become a blank slate\nb. turn into a crying mess\nand I need to stop. How can I learn to be comfortable around her, or at least act like I am? \n\n[TL;DR: guy has issues trusting foster mother because she reminds him of his nmum and wants advice]\n",

        "text": "I previously posted that my coworker has been verbally abusive and passive aggressive and creating a very hostile work environment. I had gone to my boss once and it continued but to a lesser degree. \n\nI had a longer talk with the boss and she is giving my coworker a second chance, which I don't agree with at all since my coworker so grossly violated hostile work environment laws and harassment. But I can't just up and quit, either, the job itself doesn't suck and I like everybody else, and I need the income for now. \n\nBut I realize that this in ways violates my boundaries, violates what is right, violates a lot of things. I told my boss that I don't know if I can stay much longer then, that I need to see true improvement from my coworker, that she can't just keep randomly attacking people, that is not even workplace appropriate and really has nothing to do with how I feel about it or how I'm affected by it. My boss accepts this new reality and I did not even get let go, she wishes I would choose to stay a long time instead! \n\nI also told her everything my coworker has said and done, because not only did it need to be said, but my coworker also apparently tried throwing me under the bus because I was supposedly slamming things. I laughed and asked my boss why, even if I did, is it okay for my coworker to repeatedly do these things but the second I do it, she's such a huge, supposed victim? I told my boss that I personally completely understand what her deal is (she's an N with double standards and her supposed SGs which she doesn't even really have are supposed to cower in fear in the corner), and it isn't in any way acceptable in any sort of way. \n\nI've worked with bad coworkers before in bad work environments and I used to actually cower with fear, then be afraid of reporting the abuse, because I would be afraid I'd be fired and retaliated against. Now I don't quite care. I care in the sense of how this violates things in a legal way. I care that I have the right to a safe workplace. But I don't care PERSONALLY what my coworker thinks about me, I think she's nuts and needs serious psychological help and doesn't have any business working at all right now, and while it would seriously suck if I DID lose my job I can find another one.

        "text": "I feel like my mother is becoming more unhinged with age. I barely see her anymore, just family events, holidays, things I can't really avoid her at but she acts pleasant and normal because other people are around. She can't even act normal at these events anymore. She was drunk in the middle of the day to visit my grandmother (her mother - in- law) last week, and couldn't stop making snide comments the whole 2 hours we were there. It doesn't really bother me. I suck it up every few months, bitch to my fiancé when I get home, she agrees she's insane, and that's that. \n\nI DO have to hear about her drunken antics, and random rage via my grandmother (her mother) and my sister on a nearly daily basis. I don't mind, I love them both, I feel sorry that my sister still has to live with her for now, and that my grandmother birthed such a rotten person. I can listen, I can sympathize, but I always give the same advice - cut her the fuck off. Stop doing her favors. Stop \"lending\" her money. Stop driving her places. Stop doing these things for someone who just never says thank you, and treats you like crap. My grandmother is terrified to say no to anyone, wants desperately to be useful and does this under the facade of being nice. (I love her to death, don't get me wrong.) \n\nSo, for nearly a year she's been ignoring my advice. Buying her a pack of cigarettes every day. Getting hung up on if my grandmother needs something, but then being readily available when my mother needs money. Anyway, my brother comes home recently.  Ex-GC turned addict, now recovered still SG brother. Comes home to visit, and my moms drunk the entire time. Ruins his first day back , ruins his trip. Which has finally led to my grandmother bawling her eyes out for hours to me, telling me \"I was right, she is an evil person.\" My heart was breaking for her, and for my brother of course, but my meek, scared to say no grandmother is weirdly empowered now. \n\nI weirdly feel bad for my mother, because I'm not the most stable or sane person around. I carry a lot of her with me, and I don't think I'll ever fully rid myself of that. I know what it's like to bawl your eyes out and just think \"Woe is me, everything is awful, everyone is out to get me, I'm the victim, I'll never have normal interpersonal relationships!!!\" But I feel good that I'm free of this. My grandpa called my dad and told him he needs to get my moms drinking under control. Like this isn't my shit to deal with anymore! Someone else sees this is a problem and is saying something! It only took 20+ years!",

        "text": "I don't want to give away too much detail since my N has so far not found my reddit account. Exact details about this could definitely pinpoint exactly who I am, so please excuse if this is a little generic. Right now I am just so pleased to realize I have actually made progress I just feel I want to share with folks who understand.\n\nI do not contact my N but because I have a family member in failing health in another state I have a number the N can leave me messages at. For simplicity I'll call this family member DFM for \"dear family member\".  DFM lives in the next state over from N and I, so I don't get to see DFM as often as I'd like. DFM's health issues have been snowballing of late so some things DFM used to do are no longer possible without special accommodation. \n\nThe N of course stalks me like its their job and somehow found out I was going to be visiting at the last moment. Of course the N felt it necessary to leave a long-winded message regarding all the details of DFM's health constraints with loads of commands on how I should handle every teensy aspect of our time together. I didn't bother to hear it all out before deleting but did happen to hear an admonition to not even mention a certain activity DFM always loved doing with me which was incredibly ironic given the plans I'd already hatched for the weekend.\n\nJust before my visit while talking directly with DFM's carer I had a sudden idea of a way to make it possible for DFM to enjoy that thing with me once again by renting some specialized medical equipment. My DFM is in a rural area without much available locally, but since I was driving through a couple of cities to get there I managed to track down equipment I could temporarily rent for a pretty hefty price. DFM went to a lot of trouble when I was young to take little me out of the N's clutches to do nice things on many occasions, so I considered it worth it. I cleared it with the carer who told me she was quite happy I'd come up with a viable plan and gave it her blessing.\n\nThe fun began when a couple of other relatives showed up for their regular scheduled visit to DFM while we were enjoying making use of the equipment I'd rented. I did not realize they had changed to visiting every Friday but wouldn't have changed my plans if I had. They were very happy to see DFM enjoying something that had once been such a part of their life and happily complimented me many times. The N is always on her best behavior when she's around wealthy relatives so these two are largely unaware of what my N is really capable of. One of them thought others of our family would be happy to see DFM enjoying this activity and posted a photo on facebook. I'll call the poster FBP for \"Facebook poster\" for clarity in telling the rest of this story.\n\n The N is always on her best behavior when she's around wealthy relatives so these two are largely unaware of what my N is really capable of. The N was so completely freaked out by seeing DFM appearing to do something N hadn't thought possible that the first several replies were just groups of letters and incoherent word sequences. I've never seen my N at a loss for words in any situation. FBP came up to me and asked was my N aware I had made these arrangements. I said I hadn't told anyone because I wasn't certain until I actually had the rental in hand it would happen whereupon FBP wordlessly showed me the N's incoherent comments. FBP looked concerned but didn't really comment.\n\nJust a few weeks ago even I would have been completely freaked out that my N was clearly completely pissed off at me. After a few moments FBP flashed the phone again which showed a one word comment from the N and that one word was my name. This time I just couldn't help busting out laughing. FBP quietly asked was I going to explain to N and I told her \"Nah, I'm already in trouble. It'll be fine.\" DFM is well aware of what N is capable of and was clearly pleased I wasn't immediately turning into a blob of misery at the first sign of N's displeasure. FBP seemed nonplussed by my reaction which was fine by DFM and I and we went on with what we were doing. \n\nAfter a bit it was time to pack it up and get DFM back inside after which I had to go get settled in my hotel. FBP pulled me aside to quietly assure me it was ok she'd explained to my N I had procured specialized equipment to make what we'd done completely safe for DFM. I was surprised to find I didn't really feel one way or another about that, but thanked FBP since it seemed like the polite thing to do. DFM pulled me aside to thank me and hugged me. During the hug DFM whispered they were sorry FBP felt it necessary to explain to the N and laughed.\n\nToday my N got a flying monkey to call me and ask where I'd procured the specialized equipment. I did not cave and spill the beans as I would have done in the past. I said the equipment was ungodly expensive because I had to procure it from far away which was completely true. Then I said I didn't want to talk about it because I didn't want to think about the extravagant expense. After another fifteen minutes or so of chit chat FM tried to bring the conversation back around to the specialized equipment so I said I had to go. I'm sure the N wanted the details so as to be able to more believably claim credit for the whole thing since it went well.\n\nI'm sure N is currently working to make me look like the bad guy somehow for what I did last weekend but it was worth it to see DFM so happy for once. Even nicer to realize I'm making progress. \n",

She never asked to see him.  She failed to acknowledge his birthdays.  She didn't care.   Typical. \n\n-  Interestingly, while we were NC she began counselling those suffering from \"Grandparent Alienation\"  \n\n- She presented me as \"alienating her as a grandparent\" to others.  (She chose to cut contact.  She never asked about her grandchild.  Simply blamed me.)\n\n- Upon re-connection, she suddenly wanted weekly visits. \n\n- I agreed to monthly visiting and suggested counseling until we resolved our conflicts. \n\n- She was pissed.  I maintained my boundaries  (thanks everyone!)\n\nNow she has moved - literally - to the other side of the world.   \n\nShe couldn't find the time to visit her grandchildren for two months before leaving.    \n\n**To all those who believed I \"alienated [NMOM] as a grandparent\" they finally can see for themselves her true colours as a grandparent**\n\nI never defended myself to others.    I maintained my boundaries.    I feel great.  \n\nOh, and NMOM and I had a pleasant visit before she left.  We parted on good terms.\n\nA new chapter of peace begins.

By the time I reported it as a teenager (on my own, no thanks to emom and efamily), the police couldn't press charges as there was no evidence. Technically my case is still open, 20 years later. \n\nI've been in therapy for years and found my own peace with the traumatic memories, this post isn't about that. This post is about my ndad getting a job as a janitor at a private elementary school.\n\nHe's been unemployed for years and has been verging homelessness until he landed this job. I do not give a shit about that, his financial decisions have had that long coming.  However, my GC brother and sister in law, and infant nephew bear the brunt of my ndads money sucking ways if he doesn't have a job. I don't care about GC, I do care about SIL &amp; infant nephew.\n\n I am confident if I sent an anonymous email with the police report I could get him fired and possibly keep some kids safe. He's never attacked a stranger that I know of though, focuses his victims within his family and women he dates. Charms everyone else, you know the deal. Very few people believed me yo begin with, but thankfully (?) He has domestic assault charges for fucking days that back up that he is at least violent.\n\nSince the \"accusation\" (me telling the truth to the police despite 4 panic attacks and the six tries it took to get the whole story out on paper), my ndad focuses on how he's actually the victim in all this. How my \"accusation\" makes it difficult for him to find work. \n\nIf I contact the school his victimhood will be solidified in the mind of my brother, and I will likely face fallout even if they don't find out it was me. It may also get my dad to focus his bullshit on me again (I'm 8 months pregnant, and can take no narc-y bullshit at the moment. I've enjoyed peace for 4 years).\n\nI was going to let it go and not get involved, but I recently found out a friends underprivileged son just got a full ride scholarship to this school hwhich is 20k a year) and it just got real to me. I just feel like I have an obligation to try and protect the kids with the information I have.\n\nBut if I turn him in he'll just try to get another habitual position. I can not go through life trying to protect potential victims, that's not healthy for me or my recovery.\n\nSo what do I do? Send a copy of some police reports to the PTA board and let them lead a campaign while facing potential fallout for me? Let it go and try to focus on my own kids and new narc free life?",

Told a friend I had said something nasty about him when I have no recollection of it whatsoever. This is something she does, at first I thought I was going crazy, I was the rude mean one who didn't listen to her properly and that I was a terrible person. She would make me think I had said things I had never said or that past events happened different to how I remember it. I started blaming my anxiety (because I'd read anxiety can make you forget things)\n\nEven now I question if I was the narcissist or if she was. I'm sad because I thought she was the one that understood me out of everyone else and now I know, she was collecting information to use against me. Every argument we had she would say things that would be very hurtful because she knew exactly what would hurt. She would use words to describe me that made me feel small, weak and unreasonable. She did something that really hurt me a few years ago, really rocked the foundation of our 'friendship' and when I couldn't let it go or forgive her I was told it was my fault for not getting over it. For not being able to move on and forgive like she has. \n\nI suppose I am writing this post because I feel quite alone in this, we share so many mutual friends. Our mutual friends make up most of my social group. I don't have many others outside this group and I'm trying to keep it neutral, to not say anything bad about her to them but I know she is trying to get them to think less of me and take her side. I feel powerless and like I need to exit the group but why should I when they are my friends too?\n\nI can't stop wondering if I'm the narcissist, the toxic person as she has told me I am. She knew me the best so what if she is telling me the truth and I'm just too set in my way",

        "text": "My parents are divorcing and things are tense. They are both absolutely horrible people, though mom is often the crueler one. I no longer live in the home, but 3 of my siblings still do. I am LC because I still want to have a relationship with my teenage siblings. I had my sister over for a night this past weekend and I found out some things about my dad which are disturbing to me. \n\n[trigger warning]\nHe choked out sister1. He keeps threatening to kill their pets (in graphic ways) and burn down the house. He attempted to poison the dogs with chocolate. He keeps urging brother to kill himself (who as GC is not taking the divorce well). He will come home drunk and slap sister2's butt (sexual in nature), to the point where she has to block her door with furniture to prevent him from entering her room. Sister1 found drugs in his room and he confessed to brother, about using drugs. Fortunately Dad has left for the month to stay with his new GF in another state; other than N-mom's routine non-physical abuse, the kids are not in immediate danger. \n\nIt feels like I can't escape the abuse. It sucks you in. My heart breaks for my siblings. I'm gone, but it feels like I will never really be free. I bought a lock for sister2's door, and fire alarms for each of their rooms (at their request) which I will be installing next week while they are on a road trip with mom. (Telling mom is a can of worms, I'd rather take the heat after the fact, because at least they'll have these simple protections.) I called CPS on my dad, and I fear for my safety if he ever finds out it was me. I've tried very hard to keep my address a secret: I think he knows where I live, which has been weighing on my mind heavily lately, but I'm not 100% sure. To make matters more stressful, my husband and I are having a reception next month to celebrate our recent marriage, and everyone (besides the GF) will be there.\n\nMy husband does not understand my fears or troubles, or previous suffering though he tries to be supportive. He doesn't understand that a parent could desire harm for their child. My dad is a psycho: if I push him too far, he will hurt me, hurt my husband, damage my property, kill my cat, or worse. I want to cry whenever I think about my wedding reception: It is becoming so incredibly stressful. I don't know how to help my siblings, and I don't know how to protect my life from this insanity. \n\nAny advice, comfort, support, extra-special self care tips, etc will be greatly appreciated. I'm already making a therapy appointment. Thanks for reading. \n\nTLDR: I called CPS on my dad for abusing my siblings. Fearing for my (and my husband's) safety if he finds out. Feeling mixed emotions about reporting him. Worried about the future. Feeling trapped and paralyzed by abuse.",

        "text": "I have been NC with both of my parents for about a month, a little more.  I believe that most of what has happened has been by my father and my mom has gone along with it.  I have cut all financial ties to them and will not be inviting them to our elopement. Due to life dream/goal changes I made with my fiance, my parents were outraged and refused to give us their support of our plans.  They supported us moving to their city and being in a career field neither of us wanted to be in but now that those plans have changed, they said things about me and my fiance they can never take back.  I have realized that I have been in a codependent relationship with my mother for 22 years and with this NC I have been able to slowly chip away at who I am as a person.  I no longer text or call for their advice or council and it feels great. They no longer are manipulating me with money or emotions because of the NC and financial freedom I have put into place.  HOWEVER...they have called all of the family to tell them to not support our plans.  I have communicated with family our side of the story and our side of the 8 page emails and they all are in support of us and are upset at how my parents have acted.  I hear from my moms sister who has been great support through this that my mother is coming into town without my father in a week.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I think this NC has been great and really I do not have anything to say to her. At the same time, she is my mother and I think most of this crap storm has been from my father.  But she hasn't contacted me to apologize or say she is not in agreement with him.  I am stuck--do I explain to my mother how I feel about our unhealthy relationship and explain this NC so maybe she can start helping herself and be aware of it too?  Or do I refuse to see her when she comes?  Ultimately I know that I am not responsible for her happiness and I know if met with her current emotional state, I will feel that pain.  I am positive anything that happens will go right to my father anyway...any suggestions/person experience/advice is welcome. Thanks guys.         ",

        "text": "This is the first time that I've openly talked about this online like this. \n\nA little backstory before I ask for advice - I went NC from my Nmum about 4 months ago now. Since then it has been a really crazy time. \n\nI originally went to stay with my dad and his partner, before running away from there too after I overheard his partner saying to him that she agreed with how my nmum treated me after we had gotten into an arguement where she had thrown several phrases that I had told her my mum had used in the past in my face.\n\nFrom there I was taken in by a friend and his family. They've accepted me and have given me a space as an extended member of their family. They have been nothing but friendly and I couldn't have wished for anything better.\n\nNow I'm waiting for support, it's going to be quite a lot of months away at the earliest. But some of the issues I have from living with my Nmum, and also an Nex are still rearing their head to this day and I don't know how to deal with some of them.\n\nSome of my biggest issues revolve around food. I either don't eat or I overeat to the point of making myself feel ill. This comes from my Nmom using food as a weapon against me. She had strict house rules that had to be followed and if they weren't followed her punishments would range from being shut in a room for times, being hit or not being allowed to eat. Even in the months before I left, if I put my dinner on before hers due to almost passing out she'll take it out and throw it in the bin. Or she'd run away to her room screaming about how she'll just starve if I put on something that she didn't like. \n\nAs a result of this I have very limited control on my food intake. I am always in fear over if this will be my last meal for quite a while or if someone will take it off me when I'm eating. No matter how much I try to combat this I still rush down all my food without pausing to taste, and if anyone tries to come near me when I'm eating I act like an animal protecting their food.\n\nBut on the flip side of that, if I'm left to my own devices then I just don't eat until I'm feeling ill (I get lightheaded and dizzy when I don't eat) and then only enough to satisfy myself. I can't even motivate or force myself into cooking anything nice for myself either as I often feel as though I don't deserve that nice meal or I just don't deserve food in general.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to get over this issue please?",

        "text": "Dear Mom,\n\nThis coming fall will be four years since we've stopped talking. In those four years, I am happy to say that much of the anger and pain resulting from our relationship seems to have dissipated. I occasionally suffer from the melancholy one would expect with the loss of blood-related family members in one's life. It's difficult to reconnect with the motivation I had to terminate our relationship, other than to know that it was necessary and the right thing to do. I know that my attempts to proactively address your negative behavior towards me was met with resentment, blatant dishonesty, gas-lighting and a general unwillingness to collaborate in the spirit of a loving relationship. Your attempts at collaboration amounted to manipulation, control tactics and power plays. I find it very telling that you refused to allow us to have a telephonic therapy session with your own therapist, likely because you feared my version of the story would overpower the narrative you carefully weaved and rip off your mask.\n\nIf I could have managed to keep you in my life while simultaneously overcoming my lifetime of pain and resentment from our relationship, I would have done so. The breaking point for me came down to the realization that I was beginning to repeat your mistakes in my own family relationships. A lot of my emotional chaos causing these mistakes originated from unresolved problems in the past, but a lot of the chaos originated from continuous problems in our present-day relationship. You proved unwilling to be a positive force in rectifying these problems, and seemed intent upon perpetuating them. My choice could not have been clearer. As for the kids, my daughter has begun asking about your absence and seems to grasp that I do not have a mother in my life (in having assigned me my mother-in-law as my new mom). For now, I have simply explained our situation as being due to you \"not talking\". My son is too young to grasp my lack of family, and certainly doesn't share the common history you shared with my daughter.\n\nI struggle daily to not repeat your mistakes as promised. Above all, I seek to not pretend I am a better person than you are (as you did with your own abuser). As you modeled to me, doing so is a grave mistake where it prevents truly deep reflection and occasionally offering recompense for mistakes that I've made. The last thing I want is to prevent myself from growing as a person due to delusions of moral superiority (all out of fear that I am not morally superior to you). I know that I am not, and that is a big, big difference between your belief system and my own. I am as vulnerable and raw and weak and selfish and perhaps as damaged as you, although assessing our relative damages is a difficult thing to know.\n\nDid you ever reach a point where you felt compassion towards your abuser, Mom? The further along I go, the more compassion I feel towards you. I know how much you have suffered in your life, and how the difficulties in our relationship have extended that suffering. I feel sad for what you have lost in your life, including the loss of our relationship and that of your grandchildren. I feel sad for how empty, isolated, angry and generally unhappy you have always been. These feelings of compassion did not arrive overnight, and were only able to develop with the relative peace I've acquired in the absence of our destructive relationship. Feeling compassion for you is a very strong indication that I made the right choice. I also thankfully feel compassion for myself, which is new territory for me. I more readily accept my flaws without feeling the need to beat myself up over them. I more willingly communicate feelings that would have previously required a massive amount of compensating with destructive, stupid and negative behaviors. More and more, I've begun feeling like I'm being the person that I want to be. I truly like myself, and enjoy who I am (imperfections and all). I am no longer ashamed of myself. I truly wish that you could have the same.",

I love my current job but I've been given more and more responsibilities with no pay increase over the last 3 years. My 21-year-old car finally bit the dust and car-pooling with the boyfriend isn't always easy because we work hectic schedules. But with my current pay, there's no way I can afford a car payment, let alone save for a car. So, I finally got fed up moping around about my situation and started applying for jobs.\n\nI got a call back for a job I REALLY want. It's a huge pay jump (10K in Salary before taxes) and it's something I would just really excel at and it's a huge step in the right direction for my career.\n\nOn my application, per some advice I received here earlier, I marked I did have a disability (OCD, Manic Depression, and PTSD were on the list all of which I have and maintain with therapy and medication.) \n\nDuring the interview, it was made clear to me that hyper organization was needed to excel in the roll I was applying for. So I took a deep breath and looked my Interviewer right in the eyes and said \"I'm going, to be honest with you. I know that I marked that I have a disability on my application.\"\n\nSo seemed a little surprised that I mentioned it and she said: \"Yes, I did notice that.\"\n\nI went on to say that the reason I marked YES is that I have OCD, Anxiety, and PTSD. I manage these things with medications, so they're not a real problem. But being that I do have OCD, being hyper organized is actually a non-issue for me.\n\nThe woman interviewing me smiled and said \"Well, in the case, how do you handle things when things change suddenly?\"\n\nI said that was a great question, and said that because I manage my disorders well, I have a lot of fluidity in my personality that maybe others with OCD and anxiety don't have. I gave an example where if I was planning an event for 80 people, and 3 days before the event I get a notice saying 100 extra people are coming, and the venue I picked out can only hold 150 people tops, I would actually do okay with that. Because that situation is something that can be fixed with a lot of hard work and maybe some ass kissing and begging. It's only when the bottom falls out of a situation and I can't catch it or fix it, that I struggle.\n\nThe woman interviewing me said that was pretty normal of anyone and seemed pleased I talked about it.\n\nI know it's hard to talk about this stuff. But I'm hoping being honest about it works in my favor and I am offered this amazing opportunity. ",

        "text": "&gt; When fearfulness infects you, neither avoid it nor let it recruit your mind. Don't give it a thought. Approach the infected areas with care. No antibiotic heroics, no psychosurgical wizardry, just ordinary everyday caring. Touch the infection with undivided attention, while letting the raw reality of it touch you, penetrate you, shake you more awake. Make contact, intimate contact, allowing it to breathe, allowing to it vibrate, sound off, even grieve. Stop treating it like an adversary or disease. When approached with sufﬁcient care, fearfulness helps fuel our entry into a quality of openness wherein we cannot be threatened.\n\n \\- Robert Augustus Masters\n\n&gt; Contempt is the weapon of the weak and a defense against one's own despised and unwanted feelings. And the fountainhead of all contempt, all discrimination, is the more or less conscious, uncontrolled, and secret exercise of power over the child by the adult, which is tolerated by society (except in the case of murder or serious bodily harm). What adults do to their child's spirit is entirely their own affair. For a child is regarded as the parents' property, in the same way that the citizens of a totalitarian state are the property of its government. Until we become sensitized to the child's suffering, this wielding of power by adults will continue to be a normal aspect of the human condition, for no one takes seriously what is regarded as trivial, since the victims are \"only children.\" But in twenty years' time these children will be adults who will pay it all back to their own children. They may then fight vigorously against cruelty \"in the world\" - and yet they will carry within themselves an experience of cruelty to which they have no access and which remains hidden behind their idealized picture of a happy childhood.\n\n \\- Alice Miller, *For Your Own Good*\n\n\n&gt; And then there are risks that are entirely internal. Before healing many people live in such denial of their true feelings that they don't even feel pain. They live in a numb bubble, which, although deadly, often feels pleasant. Opening up ancient wounds forces the eruption of buried feelings, which tend to be ugly, stinking, painful, and pressured. This is a great shock to a system which has long become accustomed to feeling little or nothing - just as eating healthy food can initially feel sickening and even deadly for a junk food addict or a starving person. Few enjoy the grieving process, few enjoy crying, few enjoy the prolonged miseries and anxieties and radical self-doubts and sleepless nights and even physical illnesses associated with deep emotional growth, but such is change. It has its costs, but for the few willing and able to undertake its true journey, the benefits, in the long-run, are wonderful.\n\n \\- Daniel Mackler, \"The Risks of Emotional Healing\"\n\n&gt; It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\n\n \\- Jiddu Krishnamurti",

I guess the purpose of this is twofold: shouting out for some support/wisdom and also wanting to say how truly worth it NC is to anyone considering it, even if it's not without its own pains.\n\nI've been NC with Nmom for about 16 months and in therapy for about as long. \n\nI'm doing and feeling SO SO much better than I ever have in my life. Seriously, in less than a year and a half I've gone from pretty debilitated by anxiety and depression to feeling creative and free and generally ok if not actually kinda happy most days of the week. I started a non-profit with one of my best friends that's actually already doing pretty well and is super exciting and fulfilling work. My artistic work is going really well and getting opportunities. I cut out a bunch of toxic friends and am left with a couple wonderful wonderful people who I actually love and trust and can depend on. I am having reasonable success at managing my anxiety through meditation and therapy. I'm in a new relationship with someone who is immensely kind, patient and understanding and who treats me in this beautiful way that old-me probably would have been too scared and self-hating to even accept.   \n\nThat all said, every once in a while Nmom still gets an email through to me and it still totally derails me. She even got my dad to text me on my birthday to encourage me to call her. She will \"never stop trying\". And is trying to guilt me into no contact by talking about how much she's apologized for everything (not true) and talking about how good \"forgiveness\" would be for both of us. She thinks I'm as miserable as she is, and probably can't even imagine how happy I am without her. But still, her schemes kind of work. I feel guilty, I feel ashamed. I blame myself for how bad I feel. I get angry and scared and hopeless. It triggers C-PTSD flashbacks. \n\nShe makes me doubt myself and doubt NC, though I'm committed to not breaking it.

Anyway I met this guy online and we just hit it off straight away, we just clicked and seemed to magnetize together. I met him and we did end up having sex, I didn't hold back because it felt right, and I missed being intimate with someone. I ended up staying the night, he was really nice always asking me if I was okay etc...anyway he texts me everyday asking me about my day, telling me about his, he told me all about his life, family life, friends life etc...went through so many photos etc...I feel embarrassed because I have no friends. I was stuck in an abusive relationship for 6 years but he has no idea, and I don't want to bring that negativity into the relationship with him. He seems to really like me beyond sex and called me to ask if I could go for lunch today etc...I feel ashamed that I have no social life or friends to introduce him to, but I also don't want to lose the connection we have. We have agreed to meet this week, and I am excited to spend time with him, but am terrified of falling for someone and being hurt, so I have my guard up even though he is very free and easy. \n\nI know the main thing I need to do is to work on making friends I think and myself, and I don't want to be with him out of insecurity but I have feelings for him. \n\nWhat should I do? should I continue this? what happens if he starts asking about friends etc? I also don't want it to be a distraction from doing my own work on myself. \n\nThanks.",

        "text": "[EDIT: POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING. EMOTIONAL AND NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE POST] \n\nYou ever just block stuff out because it's too hard to deal with? This is often a memory that just comes up for no good reason. Usually, it's spiked by 'baby shower invites'. Low and behold I got one. I was driving to work today when I had a flash back. I had a very violent miscarriage at about 2 months pregnant when I was 23. It was a blessing in disguise because the guy who was the father turned out to be an abusive fuckhole. But it was still extremely traumatic. I hemorrhaged, I was alone if I tried to move or get up blood shot out of me. By the time I crawled to my phone and called 911 and got to the hospital I had no blood pressure and no temperature. I vaguely remember the feeling of chest compressions. But I don't 'remember' getting them if that makes any sense. It's like I was in and out of consciousness and everything just went white.\n\nObviously, they got me back. I woke up in the hospital a few hours later to my (at the time) boyfriend (baby daddy). He had been out of town when it happened and flew back in when he got the news. I was staying with my mom when it happened and she was gone and out with her boyfriend.\n\nObviously, my mother found out about what happened seeing as how I had moved back in with her to try and save money to buy a house before I was pregnant. She acted concerned but not to the point that normal parents are when their child almost dies and it's kind of a miracle of modern medicine they didn't.\n\nA week later after the miscarriage, as I'm still recovering from it, she announces she's throwing a baby shower in our house for some church friend I never met. She ordered me to help her decorate or she would shove and scream at me that I was being selfish and rude. She ordered me to stay for the party to show everyone what a supportive and obedient daughter she has. I ended up breaking down in tears mid party and leaving. My mother shamed me for it for weeks on end. It was shortly after that whole ordeal I moved out of her house and went no contact. I haven't spoken to her since and I'm now 30.\n\nEvery time I think about reaching out to her, my PTSD reminds me of the heartless monster she really is.",

If I didn't, she'd get angry.\n\nEven at 35 yo I still felt like I had to ask her permission to do anything.\n\nIt's been 10 months since she passed away and I find it extremely difficult to commit to do anything, especially when it has anything to do with taking on responsibility, like watching over my cousin's kids.\n\nI always arrive at least 5 minutes late to work (it's a miracle they haven't fired me yet lol) and it's nearly impossible for me to mark anything in my schedule that isn't related to work or to dancing classes that I started to attend.\n\nThose take priority over anything else.\n\nI have a ton of chores to do at home, like laundry and dishes, but there's always a huge backlog because I never finish the task properly.\n\nI moved to a different apt. about two months ago and I still don't have a closet, I didn't hang anything on the walls, the TV's aren't connected to anything (well, I mostly stream anime online, but still).

        "text": "This is very interesting to me, because mainstream society has a lot of cartoonish ideas about what a narcissist looks and acts like. Always openly arrogant, obnoxious, making it obvious they are selfish and self-absorbed. My narcissist was nothing like this! \n\nMy narcissist (about a 1.5 year relationship, with periods where I'd try to escape/go NC but he'd keep hoovering) was covert and was excellent at hiding what he was. He was a master at breaking down my self-esteem and making me question my own sanity. Somewhere inside me, I knew he was very harmful to me, but I was also addicted to him and the rush of emotions I felt when I was with him. I was ignorant about NPD back then and thought my feelings were intense emotions, love, a connection, etc. Now I know that he was just manipulating me and shaping me to be a co-dependent forever, and that there was never any love or connection there, that it was all psychological warfare and him using me as fuel. But at the time, this \"addiction\" was so strong and so difficult to break free from, that it took extreme events for me to finally break free forever and go NC for good.\n\nI only saw his mask drop when 2 unusual, emotionally intense events occurred in my life within a short period of time. My best friend of 20 years died and I had a surgery, only 6 months later. My covert narcissist couldn't handle my emotional needs during either event. I remember when my friend died, immediately upon hearing the news, I was a mess and his response was \"I'm really busy with work right now\". I remember being so stunned by his complete lack of empathy, how he felt annoyed by me. I left him after and maintained a 3 month period of no contact, but wasn't strong enough to resist his hoovering and relapsed, got involved with him again for another couple of months, needed to have surgery, and once again his mask fell. I actually caught him cheating on me at the same EXACT time I was having surgery. \n\nThat last time I went NC and never looked back. I blocked him on all forms of communication/social media so he could never have the opportunity to hoover. I went to therapy and did 6-7 sessions, with the goal in mind to never get involved with another narcissist again. Narcissists can be so covert and manipulative that you have no idea what happened until a long time later. Most people don't know the signs for a covert narcissist. I believe they are one of the most dangerous types of people you can meet in this modern age. ",

Also posted this on /raisedbynarcissists FYI \n My nmom is a terrible decision-maker, ever since i was like 11 she attempted to move from our eastern european country to the UK various times. Dragging me along of course and coming back each time. She would also ask me make all major and even minor decisions for her.I noticed this trend and promised myself it would never affect me. But what do you know... Long story short I went to the UK for university, dropped out of two different courses now, re-applied for a third. got in where I wanted and where seems healthy for me(in terms of having support networks and etc):Only got the news yesterday since it was a late application and I also wrote to them explaining my circumstances. . After a brief moment of happiness, i started having doubts, thinking I should have chosen a 'lesser' university in the same city, that i can't handle this, that it will be too difficult and i wont like it again, maybe i should do a combined degree so that it will be easier/more varied..... LIKE SERIOUSLY. This has only started affecting me after my drop outs,which were mostly due to not dealing with the emotional baggage that my abusive parents left me with.But of course, after being told constantly that i will be a failure and dropping out i understand why these feelings of self-doubt have increased. I know that when I set my mind on something I can get it, i have proved to myself this various times and YET i am still extremely struggling to just be ok with a decision and carry on. I am exhausted of this trend. I want and NEED a degree but this crippling self doubt is killing me. Has anyone else dealt with this or something similar??? I just really want to be my old self again,who was full of hope and dreams,despite of my abuse, but i just cant seem to be able to get out of this circle of self-doubt.",

Like, a lot. But I'm just really excited about this new development...\n\nI actually believe that RBN folks (who are often \"ADD\") have a problem with **connecting feedback loops.** We don't connect the loops, and therefore end up making less than great choices and various other effects. I definitely labeled myself as such and really had a huge \"slacker period\" of about 15 years I've been emerging from lately. It started with my dance career, but the latest thing is I've been connecting loops--many just this week about how I use my time, and also cleaning!!!!! It feels so good!!!\n\nI'm a SAHM and on Monday I was brainstorming ways to use my time (now that I've weaned myself off the internet and other compulsive stuff) and I was like, \"hmm, grocery shopping......planning meals!?!!!\" Ha ha, funny I know!!!!! All that stuff I thought i didn't have time for......ha!!!! I mean, I always wanted to be a mom going to the supermarket at 1 pm.....yes!!!! Now I can be!!!!! :D\n\nThen, I cracked the whip on husband (also Acon) and came up with a *cleaning protocol,* since we have a 1 year old.....always wipe the highchair after feeding, sweep under it every night, dishes straight into machine, rinse or wash his spoon/fork EVERY time......We've been doing it all week, and it's aweSOME!!!!!!!!!! Then, I went big.....*I dared dream of becoming a person who wipes down all her kitchen counters before going to bed.* And I did it!!!!!!!!!!!!! That very night, omg!!!!!!!!!!!! i CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!! *I can't tell you what a huge accomplishment this is for me!!!!!!*\n\nAnyways, when you stop spending your time compulsively, you find you're \"free\" to do things you never thought were possible. I even wiped down some smudges on the cabinets I'd been eyeing for months now, while talking to a friend. you GUYS, it doesn't have to be this huge, daunting project!!!! you can get there!!!!!!!!\n\nJust wanted to share my news--maybe it will also help someone get some sort of insight. Hope y'all are well!!!! Love to you all....\n\n&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",

        "text": "Lately I've been thinking again about this passage from *The Drama of the Gifted Child*.\n\n&gt; It is like a miracle each time to see how much authenticity and integrity have survived behind dissimulation, denial, and self-alienation, and how they can reappear as soon as the patient finds access to the feelings. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to imply that there is a fully developed, true self consciously hidden behind the false self. The important point is that the child does not know what he is hiding. Karl, age forty-two, expressed this in the following way:\n&gt; \n&gt; 'I lived in a glass house into which my mother would look at any time. In a glass house, however, you cannot conceal anything without giving yourself away, except by hiding it under the ground. And then you cannot see it yourself, either.'\n\nThis rings true for me, maybe more so than any other part of the book, because the most reliable 'strategy' for surviving my childhood was hiding. By the time I was 8 years old I wasn't telling my parents anything about my life or my thoughts or feelings. I was so distrustful of them that I hated when they (especially my mother - my primary verbal-emotional abuser) tried to pull answers out of me. So I pretended to be devoid of anything interesting to them, anything they could narcissistically feed on. And after enough years of doing that I started to believe I really was empty.\n\nThe lie that I was empty of any narcissistic supply for my parents went hand in hand with the lie that I didn't have any needs of my own. In part because my older brother was developmentally disabled and required a lot of attention (but also because he was much easier to get supply out of) there was this dynamic that would often play out where my mother would hurriedly, almost distractedly check in with me about some fussy surface-level concern (\"are you cold?\" or \"are you thirsty?\") and of course I was thoroughly trained to say no I'm okay. Without looking directly at her. This served the purpose of letting my mother convince herself that she'd done her duty so she was free to go back to neglecting me for long periods of time. And I would feel relieved to be put back in the freezer drawer because at least there I'd be safe from unwanted scrutiny and criticism laced with contempt.\n\nTo this day I can't recall my parents ever giving me any genuine affection or even showing any real awareness much less concern that I was withering and becoming more schizoid. I still keep even my closest friends at arms' length. I learned to neglect myself, and I learned deeply ingrained habits of avoiding intimacy because I was convinced so early in my life that close contact with others meant damaging exposure to the worst and sickest sides of their personalities.\n\nHow do you un-learn self neglect and isolation? How do you dig up unmet needs and parts of yourself that got buried so long ago you don't remember where they were buried? ",

He has figured out how to get rid of me, but because our daughter doesn't want to spend time with him, he requested a conversation with her, and I can't be around to defend her. He wanted to know why she avoids him. So she told him - because he asked - and he just said all that same denial stuff and completely minimized what she said. She is 16 and she is very smart and self-aware. I am working SO HARD to get him out of my system. But now he is working on our daughter. Wants to win her back and is beginning to force \"parenting\" on her in the effort (i.e. making demands of her time and expecting her to talk to him about her whole life, which all feels like manipulation). Our 18 yo son sees his dad the same way the rest of us do, except he just handles it all differently. He just wants to accept his dad the way he is, not have to talk about any concerns, and just be friends with his dad (he tends to act like his dad when they are together, I assume, in an effort to gain his dad's friendship and approval). \n\nWe have a court date tomorrow, I HOPE to finalize the divorce. If the judge finds any reason not to grant, my head may come flying off. This marriage I once tried desperately to save, cannot be over fast enough for me now. \n\nSo back to my question; is all of their staggering denial of our concerns and experiences, and need for allegiance part of the \"abuse\"? As long as he minimizes how she feels but still expects her to talk to him, it chips away a little every time. Like being FORCED to live with your abuser. Am I over-thinking it all?

        "text": "I have no idea if a coworker of mine is a narcissist or just plain ol' crotchety. Some people just hate their lives and hate everybody around them because of that. She regularly shit-talks ALL of the other employees yet has acted like it is a godsend that I work here because I work hard, and she has ruined everything for herself today because...\n\n...out of NOWHERE she started being snippy and seriously passive-aggressive, basically telling me I'm doing my job wrong despite me being here 10 months and my boss praising me to the heavens. Then she blew up and became verbally abusive because of another incredibly minor thing. I've gone immediately to gray rocking and I also immediately talked to our boss, who agreed that my coworker is being inappropriate (and has rather ridiculous expectations). But the first thing I heard myself say to my boss, out of my own mouth is, \"I don't know what is up with (coworker) today, but I know it isn't me because I'm here just doing my job like always, apparently she has something going on but it still isn't okay.\" \n\nFor this to be as automatic as it was is a HUGE improvement, even recently. I would have blamed myself in a small way, thinking I was somehow to blame because why would another person just blow up? Or I would have become defensive and argumentative to totally protect myself and show that I'm NOT a problem. Today I just decided I'm not even responding. She has a work thing to discuss briefly, great. But otherwise, I'm just done. I have just focused on work, having entertaining conversations with other coworkers when I leave my desk, thinking about my future and planning this weekend, but the energy has been pulled entirely away from her. It's back in my bubble, within my own boundaries.\n\nI could not do this even weeks ago. I don't know why things have improved on my end. Even my conversation with my boss was not overly emotional on my end, just professional and of mild concern that it is going to become a bigger problem since my coworker can't seem to control her attitude today.",

This past weekend the argument was over her not telling me that she was going to the salon to cut and colour her hair (she said she'd told me last week and I'd had no memory of this, and I suppose it brought back flashes of gaslighting incidents from my Nmother). I've never viewed my wife as property or someone that I wanted to control...I don't know what my problem was, as I was yelling at her.  I felt as though I were watching myself from the inside, telling myself to STFU, and cheering her on as she put me in my place.  She doesn't tolerate that sh!te from me when I'm having those moments, and I'm all for that. It keeps me on my toes!\n\nBut I don't like that this part of me is there in the first place. How did this even happen?  I moved to a different country and had no contact with Nmother and keep-the-peace-by-letting-abuse-happen-father for over ten years. (Both are deceased...I found out about Nmother's death last week, actually.)\n\nI started seeing a counselor not long ago, after another argument in which I was an entitled gobshite. There are also loads of things that I know I'll need to address eventually...things that Nmother put me through that I haven't been able to make speakable all these years.  \n\nI feel like a terrible human being for feeling relief in her death, but there it is.  Perhaps now I can focus on being a healthier person for myself and my wife. She lost her mother last year and is coping with that still...she doesn't need my nonsense on top of that.\n",

They removed us from school, friends and social activities, they controlled what we watched, listened to, what clothes we wore, books we read and plunged us into a life of poverty (by quitting their jobs and \"living on faith\") and deep loneliness. \nThey claimed they were home schooling us but never did.\nWe weren't even allowed to walk down the street alone and no life skills were taught to us.  \nBasically our lives were devoid on structure,growth and life experience.    \nThis went on for 16 years until most of my siblings and myself finally separated ourselves from our father/step mother's toxic influence, in the beginning of the first year of freedom I struggled with PTSD and severe panic attacks but in spite of this I quickly came to blossom, I made many friends, I was happy and loved who I was and felt I was truly healing. \nThen it all went wrong..\n\nI fell in love and moved to another country for two years, during this time my friends lost interest in me, my the rest of my family fell apart for various reasons, I had relationship issues with my bf, trouble finding a job and I eventually collapsed into crippling depression,anxiety, self doubt and self hate. I experienced daily painful panic attacks and had multiple nightmares each night.\nAll of these issues I struggled with to this day. \n\nWhile in another county I experienced judgement and criticism from others for not \"being normal\", not having a decent education,not knowing how to drive, cook,pay taxes, having no work experience ect.\nI was also ridiculed for being too sweet and trusting.  \n\nThis year returned to my hometown for family reasons and I was desperate to reboot my life and with the hopes of reconnecting with friends and rebuilding my family with my siblings. \n\nI haven't been successful in any area yet but I'm still trying but \nI live in utter shame and hopeless, nothing I do seems to be the right choice and I feel cursed.\nEvery time I try to pull myself up and push forward in any positive direction, unlikely and unlucky circumstances and obstacles occur, which always push me further into depression. \n\nI have dreams and aspirations and I want to rebuilt my life and self worth. I want to have the life my parents denied me and stop this vicious cycle but I'm so lost and confused. \nI dont know where to start or how, I don't know how to pick myself up or to motivate myself anymore. \nI hate my life as it is now and I'm still struggling to find a decent job. I'm in my late twenties and I feel like the rest of the world is so far ahead of me and I'll never catch up.\n\nAlso I can't afford therapy, so that's not an option.\n\nI don't know if anything will come of this post but I thought I'd reach out. Any advise, helpful resources/links or even sharing your own experiences will be appreciated. \n\nThank you  ",

But I was in the first flush of nc, where I was finally able to tell myself the world was as not filled with psycho s as I had believed. I was trying to get out of my conditioned fearfulness. So when I was approached for my number, by someone who appeared to, inexplicably, want to be my friend , I told myself \" embrace the friendly world\" . I had the sense to give the number I keep for relations of my nmom, as a safety measure. This turned out to be a very wise plan as the guy had sent several texts in the next 24 hours, asking if it was ok that he asked for my number, if I minded him text and was i ok. he called too. I didn't get the messages as I rarely check that phone so of course didn't reply but this didn't dissuade him . it should have, shouldn't it? It was a repeat about a week later and now several months later ,he still texts on occasion, asking who this number belongs too and like he has forgotten where he got it. I think it proves he should be avoided , since he can't get the message, from me NEVER having replied and even if he suspects I have him a false number, why is he SO  curious to know who the number belongs to, that he is still trying to solve that mystery months later . Ive never seen him in person since by the way and don't expect to, he was moving hence the number exchange to keep in touch (with a very passing acquaintance). Anyway keep your narc-dar up guys, even after nc. I suspect there is a middling number of toxics out there,lurking....waiting for us to let those defences down.... fewer maybe than I had thought but more than I had hoped for.",

Everything does. \n\nMy siblings and I lived in an emotionally and physically abusive hell of my own mother's creation my whole life. When I was 18 I went away for college and those of us whom she hadn't edged out of her life blindly went no contact out of sheer desperation and self preservation. It was a horrible, horrible thing we went through and did and I am still coming to grips with what happened to us and how it has affected me.\n\nI recently discovered this sub and it's counterparts. So much of what's being talked about here resonates, it's overwhelming to realize that so many others have gone through this. To find that there are words for those experiences- that there are entire communities dedicated to talking about them and healing from them- makes me feel relieved, and sad, and angry, and not alone.\n\nI've struggled with substance abuse my entire adult life. I have made tremendous growth and done a lot of emotional work to improve my coping mechanisms and my relationship with alcohol. I have gotten better. But lately, I am getting worse. I'm under stress- good stress, from an amazing new job. I started smoking again. My alcohol use is creeping back up. Nowhere near past levels of consumption, but enough that I don't like it. I don't like the way I can't get enough once I've started. \n\nI don't want to have this thing in me, this thing that makes me unable to control myself and make good choices. Sometimes I feel so strong and healthy, so lucky and proud to have come this far and learned so much and made such positive changes in my life. And sometimes I feel just as weak and broken and fucked up as I did growing up.

        "text": "Backstory: I LOVE my current job. But it doesn't pay very much. But it's A GREAT opportunity and with no degree or certificates, I'm lucky to have it. But I need more money.\n\nI feel like all I've done is work from the time i was 14 to my now 30 age, and I have nothing to really show for it. I work a great job making 30K a year, but I live in an expensive city. I don't have a lot. I live minimally.  I drive a beat up old paid for car, eat at home 6 days a week, brown bag my lunches. You know, I'm not bad with money. But there's hardly ever enough. At 30, I wish I was making more. \n\nI would go get a 2nd job, but i can't because I'm in school. Have been for five years trying to get my undergrad degree. And I'm also getting tutored in mathematics so I can skip College Algebra so its one less class to take. My boyfriend makes good money, and I just hate I can't contribute more. I hate even more so that I live in a city where having a degree is so important. There's just not a lot out there for me  as a degreeless 30 year old.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is no matter how far I get, I always feel my narc parents stepping on my heels in some way. I'd like to believe if I had functional supportive parents i wouldn't be in this situation. But I also don't try and live in that headspace. I just keep my head down and keep working hard. It's all I can do.\n\nI am trying to seek out a 2nd job with my boyfriends boss who I know personally. See if I can come in on Saturdays and clean the offices and do administrative things for them. He knows my situation, so he's supportive. I already talked to him and asked him about it and he likes the idea. Just waiting for him to have a chance to discuss it in detail.\n\nI just feel stuck. And it sucks when none of your friends understand. They're just like \"Go get another job\" and i can't seem to get them to understand there's nothing out there that's gonna pay me more than I make for the experience i have. Trust me. I've looked.",

It was playing in slow motion. I instantly had to close it due to my mental and physical reaction, and my husband asked what was wrong.\n\nOf course, this relates to a narc. Days before my 16th birthday, I broke both bones in my forearm at basketball practice. E/ndad picked me up to take me to the emergency room in his rickety piece of shit jeep that exacerbated the extreme pain I was in, all the while acting as if I was a burden who should just suck it up. The whole thing was traumatic, from seeing my arm bend unnaturally and break to being tossed around like an object afterward. No warmth or asking if I was ok. Just get in the jeep, burden whom I owe nothing too.\n\nGah. I wish people would think in any case when it comes to posting stuff like that. Fat shaming a kid then using his traumatic injury to get pageviews :(",

One thing I've noticed is that several of my friendships have changed a lot as a result. In particular, I have 2 (girl) friends who I considered two of my best friends. I've always had a hard time where it felt like they mostly reached out when they had something to talk about / problems, but a lot of the time when I did, I was ignored (not always though!). Since I've started talking more about myself and stopped reaching out to them as much, it feels like nearly all of my texts to them are now ignored. \n\nHave you guys experienced similar things? Friendships kind of ending the healthier you get? It's hard because while they have made me feel bad about myself for a long time, I still consider them close friends so it does hurt a little and makes me feel a bit lonely and loser-ish. I don't know if I should give up on those friendships entirely or what.\n\nI'm also now questioning a lot of my friendships, and wondering whether my entire life I have unintentionally been pursuing friendships with people who remind me of my narcissistic parents.\n\nWould appreciate any stories or thoughts any of you have :) Thank you for reading!\n\nEDIT: I am so grateful for all of your sharing your experiences and thoughts!

So i pretty much gave up abd focused on doing other classes.\n\nI'm at a point in my schooling where i have to get over this math anixety. I told myself i can test OUT of college algebra with the help of a tutor.\n\nThe idea of being helped in math is panic attack inducing.

        "text": "I left the relationship 4 months ago, I got a place in counselling and I knew if I was going to grow I had to leave the abusive relationship behind. I was in a severe depression after making that choice. I became a shell of who I was. I had no strength left. I thought it would make me strong to make such a decision, and to choose myself, it was the toughest thing I had ever done. It was something I questioned if I had made a massive mistake for months, I wasn't prepared for the despair and loneliness I felt, it was crushing. It felt like someone had ripped my heart and soul out of me, and I was an empty shell, that looked human. I was barely able to drag myself out of the house to go to counseling once a week, I became unrecognizable. Never felt so lost and destroyed in my whole life. There were so many times I wished he would contact me so I could go back to living what I had known for 6 years. For some reason during it, it seemed to confirm what a worthless person I was. That the only person who would listen to me was a counselor, who had no idea who I was. The person I had given my heart to, who knew everything about me had run off with someone else a few weeks later.\n\n My counselor said what I had was an addiction, and I think she was right. About a month ago the fact I hadn't talked to him in 3 months was really getting to me, so I decided what the heck, I'll add him on fbook, and say hey why not be friends, I thought I had been over the worst and accepted that I was never going to be with him. What he said was that he wouldn't speak to me out of respect for his current gf, ( he refused to stop speaking to his ex when he was with me, saying I was controlling etc...) and to go bother some other poor soul, told me it is going to go back to the way it was of no contact and he defriended me. It made me regret ever contacting him, even though I wasn't with him or anywhere near him, he was still able to demean me and affect my feelings over a messenger. I will never contact him again. It hurt knowing he had more respect for someone he was with a few months over me for 6 years. My counselor compared it to an alcoholic who wants to hang around the pub and things they are fine there, when actually it is ruining their life. It was harsh to hear that, but she was right. \n\nMy heart is completely closed right now, and I have trouble feeling comfortable around people, but I am doing my best to get back into life. I have been sorting out student debt I have got myself into, and getting papers filled out, emailing, calling people etc...and just becoming a lot more productive. I wanted to work towards getting a job but after talking to my family they said I should go on social benefit for a bit cause it is my entitlement. So, I went up there this morning, nervous but proud of myself for doing something I am uncomfortable with, I am working on feeling so socially awkward, so I walk in, and say I want to sign on, I know I have been entitled to sign on for over a month, but have had a medical issue, she starts interrogating me, saying what issue, gets me to fill all these forms out, gives me a right talking to about something 2 years ago when I signed on for a few weeks but didn't collect payments, she brings up all these issues that didn't seem relevant. I told her I am looking for work now, and she keeps asking me am I working, have I been on holiday. Felt I was been interrogated by the police. She told me to come back tomorrow with a form filled out. I couldn't wait to leave the place. \n\nI am trying to sort my life out after being in an abusive relationship and in a depression for months, I finally have the courage, motivation, and strength to deal with these things, and it sucks realizing how crappy life seems to be. I felt like shouting I have come out of an abusive relationship, give me a damn break. I just think if I find that overwhelming, how the hell can I handle a job? I am trying to take steps, but it is harder than I thought. Before I used to have the relationship that gave me strength, I used to think I don't care what happens at least I have the person I love that is all that matters, it added so much meaning and color to my life and made everything seem worth it even the bad stuff with life. I would be thinking to myself I can't wait to spend time with the person I love later, I can't wait to see him. Strangers didn't affect me. I wasn't half as sensitive, and didn't really care what way people were or what they said, now everything affects me, I think about every little thing, I worry a lot! I miss all the lovely things he used to say to me, how he would be so excited to see me, how he would be loving towards me. Now I am all alone fighting all these battles alone, I have nobody to turn to at the end of the day, or week. I feel sad and not sure if I will ever be happy again at this point.\n",

        "text": "Having kept varying levels of LC/VLC/NC with nmom over the last 10 years, and now at 25 starting to understand what healthy adult interactions look like, it's been easy to slip into a kind of complacency about my childhood abuse and the impact it's had on me. I've been doing relatively well in my post-narc life, and between moving cities, finding an excellent therapist and nurturing a relationship with a wonderful man, I've been finding myself starting to wonder if perhaps it hadn't really been all that bad. My resolve on VLC had been starting to fade - maybe a visit over Christmas. Maybe if she had my address, it would be alright. Maybe I had been exaggerating. I'm starting to consider myself an adult, unsteady on my feet but getting there. \n\nThen, tonight, I accidentally broke a candle holder belonging to my housemate/landlord.\n\nI was immediately terrified. I mean absolute, pants-shitting, heart-pounding, terror. \n\nMy housemate is a reasonable guy. It was obviously not an expensive trinket. I can replace it. I'll just offer to do so and apologise. \n\nEven as those phrases ran through my mind, I picked up the shattered pieces of ceramic and hid them in my bathrobe. Carried them faux-casually from the bathroom to my room. Laid them out on the bed, trying to piece them back together. I was completely horrified at myself as I burst into tears, barely conscious of why I was so worried. \n\nI collected myself, and after a few minutes went to find him. I cannot imagine the look on my face as I went to him to confess, but it was enough for him to drop what he was doing and hug me, reassuring me that it wasn't important, as long as I wasn't hurt. \n\nIt wasn't until just now, curled up on my bed, no-harm-done-all-cried-out, that I realised how much of a visceral regression this was to my childhood spent in a house where there was no such thing as an accident. No such thing as genuine tears. No such thing as remorse. No amount of apologies would make up for something so utterly terrible as *accidentally dropping a trinket*. \n\nI suppose it's a timely reminder for me that I can grow and learn but there's no escaping the past. Trying not to be too hard on myself for being so undone by such a trivial thing. \n\nI guess I'm looking for some solidarity. Anyone else have a story like this? Help me not to feel like an absolute idiot. \n",

        "text": "(This is a personal reflection.  It has nothing to do with other people's feelings.) \n\nI wish God would one day free me from this hell. It pains me to believe that I was mistreated by grandmother when I was four. My mother was beaten by my grandmother every week. There will be marks left on my mother's arms, legs, and teachers and students will notice. It was pure evil that my grandmother has beaten up my mother like that. \n\nHowever, this doesn't make me hate my mother any less. That's right, I hate my grandmother, so do I hate my mother. As I looked into my mother's eyes, it was only the relentless coldness I can see in her eyes, when she criticize. It was like a no-tomorrow battle for me. I would struggle with my mother in series of ways. \n\nNeedless to say, every time I loose badly. There was no way I could beat her. She could always find a way to turn me back. Her arguments are like sharp razors.  I felt so powerless and at the same time stupid, for not refuting back to her. I blamed myself for not having enough knowledge, and not enough wit to say anything for defence. I learnt that I couldn't protect myself. No matter how hard I try, there is no way I could protect myself. \n\nThat's right, there was no way I could protect myself. I don't have superpowers. I was weak, I was soft that I couldn't endure any force put upon me. When the time I think this way, I am, however, already in her trap of thinking myself as useless. Sinking deeper and deeper... \n\nI don't have to make this battle. I wonder, why do I have to fight every time. What in the world have pushed me to fight so hard and so relentlessly? \n\nWhy do I, as a human being, have to suffer such great pain? \n\nIt has been too long since I have got in touch with the world outside. I have fogotten what people could really mean when they say anything with their words. I can only see through the sky with my own lenses. A different lens.... A ... skewed lens. Sometimes I wonder, what a normal brain's prefrontal cortex looks like. Do they function reasoning better in terms of social cues and convos? Perhaps. \n\nTo think that I have been criticized almost accumulate for million times, was ridiculous. No, it was ridiculous, sad, and unbelievable.  Maybe not a million times, but serval times a week was the norm. .. and by multiplying that for 10 years... well, that was actually a million times, approximately. I guess, I should gain a trophy for sure of this. \n\nIt was no doubt that my childhood was buried in soil. The happiest memories won't last more than 3 hours. The time when I go out and play with other children, were a minor, compared to how many hours of relentless criticism I got per day. Every night, when the dawn comes, it was the time of the judgment. Cruelty of all kinds naturally would take place. \n\nIt was a relief when my mother was leaving. The midst had left.... a bit. \n\nIt was no doubt that I lived a difficult childhood due to the two people I was living with. It was barely exposed and often times well-drafted in front of public. As an insider of this (so-called) 'family', I was not allowed to expose anything to anyone, especially teachers, friends, other adults. \n\nI was taught to be absolute silence. It knitted who I am today. When I see cruelty, how would I act? Silence. I didn't know what can I do, or should I do besides silence. Justice without mercy isn't real justice. A phrase that I used to dismiss, ignore, even despise came into mind. \n\nJustice without mercy isn't real justice. How could I be merciful? \n\nJune, 30th, 2017\n(This is a personal reflection.  It has nothing to do with other people's feelings.)\n\n Thank you (in advance) to whoever read this. Thank you to whoever being kind, caring, or even enlightening in comments.\n\nI progressed a lot from the last time I logged into this account. I want to give my greatest gratitude to RBN as a whole, guiding me since June 2014. Well ... it's been three years since then. I wonder how some of the users are doing now. ",

Or maybe they'd say something much harsher... Despite feeling compelled to be that way (probably because I was completely rejected at home and so rejected conventional thought in general), there was always a fair amount of guilt that went along with it - those little tapes of disapproval from the Nparents playing in my head.\n\nThat guilt kept me in check. Maybe that wasn't a good thing because that kind of control-through-abuse is bad for anyone. But since going through therapy and letting go of those tapes, there's nothing left to hold back that inner anarchist.\n\nThis has now become an issue...maybe. Thanks to therapy I'm now hyper aware of individual rights and autonomy...and will defend them to my last breath. Being a far-leftist in a far-right land, this comes up frequently.\n\nEvery time I get shut down in a room full of men, or someone says something inappropriate, or a person bullies someone weaker or less privileged, I turn into this defensive tornado and just *have* to right the injustice. It feels like a monster woke up inside.\n\nI've lost any tolerance for people who try to control or belittle others. Or maybe the tolerance never existed in the first place - everything was held in check by the stupid fear from the Nparents.  \n\nDid anyone else go through a phase like this? Did you ever manage to find a balance that allowed you to validate your opinions while not flying off the handle?\n\nMy therapist seems very intent on \"let it all out\" right now, which sounds like a healthy approach. But surely this phase will end at some point, right? It'll mellow a bit surely. Or not?",

        "text": "Throw away account and I am not sure if this is the correct sub reddit but I need advice on a new (at least new to me) form of torture in the narc arsenal of emotional abuse. Currently I am processing through the realization that I have dated a narcissist for three years and I have seen a host of behaviors that are egregious and have me convinced. Also I have gone NC before only to get sucked back in. This time I have blocked him.\n\nToday however he accused me of theft. This was unbelievable. He lost a phone a few months ago. We searched everywhere and he lost it while I was clearly with him so I would have had to have been magical to take it. I suspect he left it in the bathroom of the restaurant we were at and when he realized it was missing it was too late and had been pocketed.\n\nToday when I caught him texting another woman from a dating site (allegedly just a remnant from our latest break up), during the argument he accused me of stealing his phone saying that when I opened a drawer the other day he saw his phone in it. True I have several old Iphones in a drawer as well as an Ipod, but not his phone! I could not verify if his phone had somehow transported itself into my drawer because he claimed he confiscated it. I do have several phones, one being nearly identical to the one that went missing but it is indeed mine. I guess I can see someone assuming that if I stretch my imagination, but not just letting it go for weeks.\n\nMy question is why would he not bring this up to me the moment he thought I took his phone/supposedly spied it in a drawer? How could someone think another stole something from them and go on like nothing was amiss as he has done apparently for weeks?\n\nOn this I have noticed a trend in him bringing up pieces of information in a seamless ways peppered throughout conversations at odd times like he is alluding to some vulnerability or sensitive issue from my past. \n\nTL/DR; Is it typical for narcissist to wait for a prime time or unsuspecting time to blind side you or make a wild accusation?\n",

        "text": "I want to preface this by saying I am in no way judging stay at home Mom's or think you are less-than. In fact, you are some brave, strong individuals because I could never relinquish control and be dependent on anyone. I could never trust anyone that much. So you all are far braver than I.\n\nFor as long as I have been born my mother has pitted my sister and I against each other. All my life my sister and I have struggled to connect. She's always hated me as long as I can remember and never made a real effort to get to know me as a person. I was 13 when the divorce was finally finalized and just entering high school. She was 17 and already graduated. When she graduated she moved in with the guy she was seeing who had a paid for trailer (so no rent or mortgage) and made good money. They were able to save up pretty fast and buy a house. My sister stopped working, decided to not get a degree, and be a house wife. Which is her prerogative. \n\nFast forward to present day, I have Niece and Nephew (5 and 1 about to 6 and 2) that don't even know I exist. I was excessively angry at my shitty sister for a very long time because I often called her crying, begging, \"please come get me, she's going to kill me. There's no lock on my door she took it.\" And my sister always screamed and scoffed at me saying I was the reason our mother was acting the way she was.\n\nAt 17 I left and struck out on my own. Lived in a rent house with no heat in one of the coldest winters in history for my area until I could save to move into a townhome. I've been on my own ever since, no roommates at all, doing it myself, up until about 5 months ago when my boyfriend of 4 years finally moved in.\n\nI was so angry at my sister for SO long for SO many reasons....but I finally, through counseling and 10MG of Lexapro, just feel apathy towards her.\n\nI pray nothing ever happens to her now Husband and father of her kids. I pray he never leaves her, or passes away, because if she does, she's totally screwed. She has no real work experience that would warrant her a salary to keep up with their custom built home, two new cars,and two kids. She could maybe make 12 bucks an hour at an office job with what experience she has.\n\nShe has no formal education outside of high school, or any certificates. And she is not fluent in any other languages other than English.\n\nMy sister loathes my very existence because she never bothered to get past her preconceived notions of me to actually learn about who i am as a person. I hate her for a long time because I always believed she was a spoiled princess who at 34 has more growing up to do and healing to do than even she knows.\n\nBut now, I just feel bad for her. She trapped by her own circumstances and making many of the same mistakes our mother made- using her looks to bag a man with money. If her husband ever leaves or passes away, she is totally, and irrevocably, screwed.\n\nI may not have a fancy custom built house, a big wedding paid for by our shitty parents (I've yet to be engaged or married at 30 because I didn't want to settle), two fancy new cars, and live in a fancy part of town. But I have my freedom. My impressive resume, and my education.\n\nI hope nothing bad ever happens to her cash cow. And I do hope she's happy. But if I had to guess, I really don't think she is. Her and Ricky have had problems before, and she's tried to leave. But always ended back with him for the sake of security.\n\nSometimes I wonder if she hates me because I'm free.",
