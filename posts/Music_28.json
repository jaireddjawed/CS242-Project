Anything beyond that point I don't really listen to. I grew up on classic rock and my favorite band of all time is Pink Floyd. If I had to have a second, it might be Alice In Chains. But I've also listened to early blues like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters, my favorite of the genre being Stevie Ray Vaughan. \n\nNow, all that aside, I also feel like I'm missing out on today's stuff. Whether that be pop, electronic, etc. It just doesn't grab me like the older stuff does. Yet, I want to be able to connect with people from my generation who listen to modern music. \n\nAgain, I know this is a big ask, but I don't know how else to frame it. Anyone you can recommend, I'll look into.",

It was cool to see a major live act make conscious pauses for \"check in\" points to make sure everyone was good to go.

Particularly from 3:25 - 3:40 I know it's a BIG stretch because I heard this song on the radio in 2017 (George Fm in New Zealand) and still can't find it!!\n\nIt's house music if thats of any help. I'm so annoyed that I'll probably never find it hahaha",
