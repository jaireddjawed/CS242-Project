Fast forward, vyvanse was horrible for my depression and anxiety so I stopped taking any stimulants for awhile. However, I started taking Wellbutrin and adderall in winter 2021. Due to the adderall shortage, I switched to focalin and have been on it for a month or two. And I’ve noticed that I have had diarrhea pretty consistently even though my diet has not changed and it all started when I switched to focalin. Is this just a side effect? I talked to my psychiatrist abt it bc I was worried and she said it just happens but I am so tired of squishy shits. Have any of y’all experienced this? If so, what did you do to remedy it ?",

When this happens, sugar is my crux. I can put down a pint of Ben and Jerries nightly during these periods in addition to chocolate candy and just other crap foods. It ends up snowballing and I have to hit rock bottom to get back into eating good again. I probably should see a therapist about this because it’s been an ongoing struggle my whole adult life. \n\nAnyways, I’m in one of those times where I’ve had enough and will continue to eat sugar in healthy ways, like honey over my Greek yogurt with some granola, but I cut out anything I would consider dessert, so ice cream and candy mainly. Anything I feel my brain spikes with dopamine in response to super sweet foods. After a couple weeks of doing this, I feel an amazing clarity and suffer from no depression and a lot less moodiness than when I’m consuming all that sugar. \n\nI know this may seem to be pretty, “well, duh” information, but a lot of my symptoms, even medicated, are a result of what I interpret to be food induced dopamine spikes and removing those has helped so much with my ADHD. I feel so much more in control and motivated with my billion pursuits when I do this. \n\nI had a hemangioma removed from my left frontal lobe when I was a young teenager and I feel that has always caused issues with my sweet cravings and overall adhd. So feeling in control is nice.  Now if I can just continue with keeping “desserts” away, which I know is not really sustainable long term, I would be good. I went two or three months last time and it took one damn time to screw it all up and get me addicted again to sugar. Anyways, just throwing it out there as I’d thought it help others.",

However, since receiving my diagnosis and starting treatment, I have noticed a significant improvement in my ability to stay on task and complete my work efficiently.\n\nFor others who may be facing similar challenges, I would recommend breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks and utilizing tools like timers and reminders to stay on track. It is also essential to be kind to oneself and not be too hard when struggling with productivity issues.\n\nOverall, my ADHD diagnosis has helped me gain a better understanding of my tendencies and limitations, and I have discovered new strategies for maximizing my productivity and achieving my goals.",

It hit me hard. \n\nI had therapy immediately after and my therapist suggested telling my manager that I have ADHD and had been struggling lately but changed my medication dosage so I should be more on top of things. I never would have considered telling him and I really feel weird about it, especially since I'm a contractor and he could just end my employment anytime without a reason. \n\nI only have a couple months left on my contract so my therapist argued that I have nothing to lose and transparency might do more for me than secrecy and perhaps he'd be sympathetic and give me more time to prove myself (I had hoped to have my contract extended or converted but lately have been sending that neither is going to happen). \n\nWhat would you do? If you have told a boss about your ADHD diagnosis, did it help or hurt your situation at work and relationship with your manager?",

Adderall worked well for me but 'hit' a bit too hard but definitely improved both energy and focus. The energy side of things wasn't that important to me but the focus 100% was.. \n\nThe shortage got me to switch over to Vyvanse starting 5 days ago and started with a 50mg dose, that I take in the AM at the same time I used to take the XR. So far impressions are:  \n\n\n* Supply: Available at multiple local pharamacies vs the dial-and-fail cycle with Adderall\n* Slower ramp up, seems fully effective about 1-2 hours after taking it\n* Similar focus effects to Adderall\n* Less of the energy/juiced feeling, which is fine by me.\n* I've struggled with insomnia for a long time (fall asleep easy, wake up at 2-3AM and can't fall back asleep). Adderall made this worse for me at the start but gradually got better. Vyvanse kicked this back to the forefront of me only getting 4-5h of sleep over the last 6 days. Hopefully this improves. I do a bunch of stuff to help with this, Calm Magnesium before bed, bedtime routine, good sleep env, etc...\n* Headaches: This is the worst part, mild to severe headaches throughout the day. Had a bit of this with Adderall that went away over time after I got my hydration routine down but Vyvanse is kicking my ass right now. I'm going to re-focus on staying hydrated but wondering if others have struggled with headaches and Vyvanse?  \n\n\nKeen to hear if others have similar experiences or thoughts",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nSorry for the long post.\n\nI'm 21F and my doctor is going to increase my dose of biphentin (similar to ritalin for those who don't know) and I'm scared about the effets it will have on my mood. \n\nI was on 10mg for 3 years because I couldn't see my doctor (she was absent). When I got first diagnosed (8 years ago), I was on concerta, but it didn't help me concentrate enough, so my doctor prescribed my vyvance 30mg. I lost too much weight on it and I felt like I had no emotions. So, my doctor prescribed me biphentin. \n\nAt first, I had 20mg, but I had a \"low blood pressure episode\" I could say (saw black dots and felt weak) so she decided to put me on 10mg and gradually increase my dose until I have the right one. 3 years later, I saw her this morning and I'm now going on 20mg. She will increase my dose once per week. \n\nI'm scared that my personality will change and that I will feel like another person again. I'm scared that I will feel angry again like I felt on the 20mg at first. I'm mostly scared because me and my boyfriend get into arguments quite often and I'm scared that it will get worse. I could tell him that it's possible that my medication will make me feel agitated and/or angry but it's not an excuse and he shouldn't have to live with someone like that. It's stressing me out. \n\nMy doctor told me that we could go back on vyvance if I have too many side effects with biphentin but I don't know, I don't like medications that I know can alter my personnality and the way I am. I'm a fun person and those medications can make me feel like I have little to no emotions at all. It can have a positive effect to not be too energetic sometimes but I'm sacred.\n\nWhat was your experience with ritalin/biphantin/concerta/vyvance? Which one worked best for you? Do you feel angrier when you take your medication? Do you feel like yourself fully? Thank you for your answers!",

As I said in my first post, I got referred to a psychiatrist for depression, but he ruled it out immediately and suggested ADHD. Being old-school (old psychiatrist), he doesn't want to do any quizzes, questionnaires, tests with me, he just asked me questions about my life and childhood and decided to try it out immediately with a very low dose of ritalin for 8 days, monitoring my reaction).\n\nThe issue is, I have an appointment with a second psychiatrist, a young one this time, to get a second opinion, tomorrow. Next appointment with him is in May so I didn't have much choice. Now, I have this phobia that I am fooling the doctors into believing I have ADHD, which is low key what my close environment seems to think (that it's in my head and I'm looking too much into it). That's why I waited for the first psychiatrist to mention this by himself even though I already suspected it.  So, I really don't want to tell the second one that another psychiatrist has already sort of diagnosed me, I want to see his own unbiased opinion, cause I know that doctors have this tendency to not want to negate other doctor's diagnosis, it seems unprofessional to them? But, I can't *not* tell him I'm on medication either, it seems dishonest and stupid.\n\ntl;dr: I'm seeing a second psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis but I don't want to tell him I'm already on medication\n\nYeah it sounds kind of ridiculous now that I'm writing this down.",

Usually I'd just take 20 mg, which worked when I took 40 mg, and not experience an adderall crash.\n\nfor the last 2-3 weeks I've been having BAD adderall crashes when I get home from work.\nI work 7-3:30 for reference.\nIf I have to drive a longer distance after work (most of my friends and family live in the college town 30 mins away, so im often there after work) I can feel the crash while driving. Its distressing and sucky.\n\nRecap: The Full timeline:\n6 am: Takes an XR 30 mg\n1-2 pm: XR wears off, takes an IR (15 mg atm)\n3:30 pm: Leave work, IR starts to wear off, Adderall Crash.\n\nThe crashes make me tired and irritable, and I'm not really able to get any house stuff done after it starts (laundry, dishes, cleaning, etc.) I end up having to devote entire weekends for catching up with it.\n\ntaking another IR dose is a different kind of problem- heart rate increases, and I cant focus on anything else except my heart rate... Its a no-go\n\nThe TL;DR:\nDoes anyone take an IR tablet first thing and then an XR when it wears off? And does anyone who does this have a XR/IR dosage combo that works for them (even if its not 30 mg)? Of course I know all adhd situations are different, but it would give me a starting point that I can reference with 30 mg.",

Other than that though, I’m exhausted, which I expected (like nodding off sitting up exhausted), but when I’m awake, I’m famished. Like legitimately hungry for everything. I’m trying to keep it healthy, but I’ve already gained 6 lbs in a week. I used to be a mindless snacker, but this is like genuine hunger, my stomach is growling most of the day. Any tips? Has anyone gone through this and not gained 20lbs? Will it ever plateau back to a “normal” hunger cycle?",

This is a huge achievement for me because I have trouble getting myself to do anything due to the lack of motivation. I only started exercising since last Saturday. I’m hoping I continue exercising because knowing myself, there’s a chance of me eventually relapsing back to my old behavior. I have the tendency to do the task for like a whole month or maybe a week, but then after that, I end up relapsing which discourages me from ever trying again. I’m 20 years old, 5’6, weigh 229 pounds (Lost 2 pounds so far), and my BMI is already at 35. I’m still having a hard time getting myself motivated because all I’m doing is forcing myself to walk even if I don’t feel like it. It’s very hard for me to ignore my feelings, which is why I have a history of relapsing. Every time I force myself to do something I know I should be doing, it feels like if I was trying to overcome a smoking addiction by not smoking. That is why I eventually give in to my feelings and relapse. However, despite the the fact that I’m still struggling, I’m still at least proud that I managed to get myself to start exercising, and I really hope I don’t relapse like I always do. I’m a bit doubtful, yet hopeful at the same time. I might send an update next week just to show how much I progressed so far.",

It would be like a doctor being bored with science or human anatomy. I didn't think I would get bored. There are moments when the law truly is fascinating. But with my ADHD, I get really bored of a topic so easily. So the idea of focusing on one type of legal practice (or law generally) seems so scary in light of how easily I get bored with things. \n\nI was diagnosed while in law school, and looking back, it really makes a lot of sense. Anyway, looking at my career choice to be an attorney (or doing something related to the law), I have this impending anxiety that I have made a huge mistake. Maybe it is just normal to feel this way now that graduation is on the horizon. But how do people with ADHD have long, meaningful careers if they are like me: I need constant change or changes of scenery to feel stimulated. Otherwise, being somewhere for too long gets boring to me. I grow restless and it is frustrating. I've been in professional settings before, but for short periods of time. Which maybe explains why I never dealt with this \"bored\" feeling before. Even with school, you have so many classes but they are only ever a semster long. So change is always happening. I was never somewhere for too long to experience it. It now makes sense why I also undertook so many externships and internships while in law school to figure out what I liked. But perhaps I was just feeding the need to not be in one place for too long. \n\nLong story short: has anyone dealt with similar issues? If so, how have you managed? Am I overthinking? Any insight would be much appreciated.",

I started seeing a counsellor and someone who works with people with adhd and they cannot diagnose me however they’ve wrote a support letter to the doctor asking if I can please see a specialist it would help my life . I didn’t realise just how much adhd symptoms I’ve had and it’s been the story of my life.\n\nI have not been to the doctors much in years, just this week I  asked the doctor if they can speed it up and like the therapist encouraged me because I do not ask for help normally.\n\nThe doctor said they want me on high doses of SSRI to deal with my anxiety and they aren’t willing to even have me on a waiting list until then. This means I’m going to end up going my whole life undiagnosed at this rate, I want to complain I feel like I’m being treated unfairly but I don’t have any support apart from a therapist so I have no idea what I should be doing next, pretty frustrated but I am determined  to somehow deal with a life of these symptoms.",

        "text": "Hey all I’m a 40 year old male. I work at a desk all day and have alot of downtime. During the downtime I like work on myself using worksheets, journal entires, budget, plan stuff out etc. I recently went from adderall IR 10mg twice a day to 20mg twice a day. \n\nThe switch helped extremely but I noticed the past week it’s barely working. Not sure if I’m just tired or need a break. I basically do everything else besides my work. Like I can focus on texting people, playing games and scrolling but the work part I just put everything off and when I do get to I get anxious. \n\nI don’t want to up or change meds. I would really like to a break. I try everyday but my brain feels so foggy with out the adderall. \n\nThe last time I tried to take a break I was super anxious and throwing temper tantrum’s getting by at the bare minimum.\n\nI think most of struggle with trying to be better than average and with out the meds with I personally just feel worthless. \n\nSo any suggestions while taking a break from adderall while working at a desk job will do. \n\nI strongly believe that not caring as much might be the best effort but i dunno I have a pretty demanding job that can take a toll on my mental health. Please don’t tell me to switch jobs it was a lot of hard work to get to where I am at. \n\nThank you so much in advance",

        "text": "I'm on extended release so the shortage hasn't really affected me until now. My regular pharmacy has my prescription on back order, and luckily we found another pharmacy that's able to fill my script tomorrow, but I'm starting to get worried about what I'm going to do if I'm forced to go unmedicated. I'm at a slight advantage because I don't take my meds on days I don't go to school (but my prescription is technically for everyday), so my mom can try to get my prescription refilled a week or so ahead of when I actually need it, which might help with back orders. But assuming that that won't help me a lot, what are some things I should do to not fall behind *too* much if I end up unmedicated? My meds are the sole reason I'm able to get through the day and I know it'll be really difficult to be unmedicated, so I want to be prepared so I'm not completely stranded in case I can't get my prescription filled.",

        "text": "I tend to relate to many people with ADHD but I have not brought it up to anyone because I fear that I am just being dramatic and the reason for my struggles are due to laziness instead. I have always struggled with consistency and routine since I was a child. I both need and want a routine but can never keep up with it no matter how hard I try. This has even impacted my ability to keep up with personal hygiene and basic everyday tasks. I am often very easily distracted but also require constant noise or videos to do anything so I will avoid doing things that take away the stimulation. Speaking of distractions, I find it difficult to keep any sort of hobby other than watching Youtube videos. I have a wide variety of interest and will want to participate in them but don’t. By the time I get the energy to engage, the interest is normally gone and I have moved on to something else. I have talked about this in therapy and to a psych and they mostly attribute the lack of interest in things that you used to like to depression. I am currently taking Wellbutrin and have noticed a more stable mood but the interest thing has not changed at all which I why I think it might be due to something else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some more background, I had issues completing school work in middle and high school and often had teachers call my parents about it. In college I did fairly well but I didn’t have much of a social life so I focused a lot on school fill my time. I also struggle with impulse control, most of this is with food for me. When I was a kid I had to get poison control called many times because I would put everything that I thought smelled or felt good into my mouth and was also binge eating by 8 years old. The binge eating has continued into my adult life as well as some sensory issues with clothing and textures. My mom would struggle to get me to wear underwear, socks, or anything with tags but the sensory issues are much more manageable now than when I was a child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this is long I don’t really know what to do about this and would appreciate some input from those of you diagnosed.",

        "text": "Hi. I'm a college student. I've recently really been tanking in my grades and was referred to get tested for ADHD. I've always thought I was just lazy and not working hard enough, but recently I realized that I might be struggling with something else. Some of my behaviors include:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot being able to get up and do work even when I have to. I want to do it and get it done well, but I just feel like it's too much. \n\nGetting constantly distracted when I finally do sit down with things like snacks or cleaning. \n\nBrain fog. I feel like I haven't been 100% in my brain since high school and it gets worse. \n\nOverscheduling things because I am afraid of missing meetings and deadlines. But then not being able to keep up. \n\nWaiting until the last minute to do anything. \n\nGetting very tired out by noises and lights. \n\nConstantly feeling the need to fidget.\n\nConstantly forgetting small things like turning off the oven, where I put my keys (in the lock), leaving drinks in random places, food in the microwave, etc. \n\nNot being able to follow lectures because the words don't fully connect in my mind or I feel like the words fly past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I need to get help, but I can't help but feel like this is normal and if I just tried harder I would be able to function as well as anyone else. I don't know if this is ADHD, but with every person saying that they also feel the same things or I just need to stop sitting around and start working or I need to get off of social media and stop diagnosing myself, I just feel like I am lazy and blowing things out of proportion. If anyone could leave a comment on how ADHD feels for them or whether my feelings of needing to see a doctor are justified, it would be greatly appreciated.",
