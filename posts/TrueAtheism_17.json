If it were any other state, they could get ordained online at Universal Life Church or some other front to get around these things and it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut in Virginia (and I think Virginia alone), they refuse to accept an officiant that isn't in \"good standing with a recognized faith organization\".  How the hell is that allowed?!?  Religion already shouldn't have a place in marriage, but now they're telling me that we can't even choose who marries us?  That's bull shit!  They're effectively saying that atheists can't have have to get married by a complete stranger, and that's somehow \"better\" than someone you know and love.\n\nHas anyone ever seen precedent for something like this, or ways to get around it?  \n\nAgain, sorry if this is off topic.

The same goes for when it is said that death is like sleeping. I'm terrified of the fact that I will never again, for the rest of eternity, be able to feel/think/be.\n\nI've seen a lot of people say they are comforted by the fact that its like a big 'sleep' forever, but that's what scares me the most. I'd rather live in agonizing pain, or drift in a black void for eternity than die, just because I don't want to /never/ be able to experience again.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? And can anybody offer any advice about feeling better about this?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments everyone! A lot of them have been really helpful. ",

        "text": "Hey, y'all! I'll be brief.  \n\nI've done quite a bit of research on church structures over the past year. In particular, I've researched a lot of mega-churches, and I've noticed something about these churches: they seemingly all adhere to the same formulas. Lights show, bombastic worship sets, generic life lessons couched in terms of PG humor. I've also read quite a few accounts strongly asserting that some pastors and church leaders knowingly manipulate people for the benefit of a comfortable lifestyle.  \n\nI'll provide the example of my parents' church:  \n\n* The head pastor \"ran a highly successful business\" for ten years after college, which happened to be working as a comedian/magician for corporate clients. His career proved to be so successful that he also worked part-time as a waiter at a Mexican restaurant for 13 years concurrently.  \n* The head pastor then began a \"highly successful sales career\", marketing agricultural equipment to corporate clients, before pursuing his \"lifelong dream of entering ministry\" by completing a pastoral internship program at a local megachurch in his late 30's. He then took over a small church a year before its old senior pastor died.  \n* Not a single pastor at the church attended seminary. More than half obtained their college degrees in business. The lead pastor makes all hiring decisions and essentially runs the church as its CEO.  The head pastor is \"accountable to three oversight elders\", two of whom happen to be old college buddies of his. The identity of the third is unknown, as no formal list of elders is made available to the church.  \n* The finances of the church are completely closed off. I was subjected to personal character attacks for daring to question why financial information wasn't available to church members, and told by the student pastor, \"We would only ever reveal any financial information to someone who is a known tither and who has been dedicated to the vision of the church for many years.\" The lead pastor filmed a video for a stewardship company a year ago that stated one of his goals in ministry as \"unity with high-capacity givers.\"  \n\nI could go on, but I posted elsewhere on this account in more detail. To summarize, I've begun to suspect that the lead pastor could be manipulating people for his own gain, by building up a megachurch. The church just completed their third building campaign of the last 4 years to begin a $7 million construction project. It's a very strong accusation to assert that a pastor could be knowingly corrupt, but I've begun to genuinely wonder.  \n\n**My questions for this community**   \n1. I'm familiar with The Clergy Project. Are some pastors closet atheists who remain in ministry for their own benefit? If so, how prevalent is this issue?    \n2. How aware are most pastors of \"The Game\"? Surely some recognize, at least subliminally, that their churches' successes owe more to marketing, light shows, and coffee shops than the hand of God.  \n3. If you could ascertain for certain that a pastor were using his congregation, would you confront them or expose the issue? Obviously this would require serious evidence. I ask because my entire family is deeply involved in my church, as well as several friends, so I don't want to see people getting used by hucksters.",

        "text": "I had my brush with it earlier on in my deconversion process. After asking, why are biblical scholars theists? I received and also PM a few people from that thread. I decided to keep an open mind and delve into it some more. I thought maybe I miserunderstood it.\n\nTheology was explained more elaborately to me but still fell short of the sniff test.\n\nOne of the first things a theist told me was to pray and ask God to reveal himself to me. What? I never heard this in any field of academic study. Just complete bonkers. I made a point about experience not being a good measure for God. If experience is a good indicator of validity then we must take every form of testimony to be true. We as humans don't do that. I mean I'd like to believe my grandma saw zombies growing up in Haiti, but that's just pure mysticism..\n\nSecondly, theology operates on presupposition that God exists. As dinesh Sousa puts it, we all have consciousness but we can't empirically test that conscious exists or that our minds exist. We just know it to be true. That's our reality. As much I hate Sousa, I thought that was a intriguing point that Lawrence krauss, his atheist opposition left unanswered. Another redditor said we often have to question our reality. Is red, really red? We take faith in that regard because to colorblind people, certain colors may not exist. I again, had no real refutation to this. Even then so, it wouldn't lead me to God. It would just lead me to believing reality isn't what I thought it to be.\n\nTheology goes on to say God is a necessary being. \"I cannot imagine the universe being created without a God.\" Wow, I didn't know that is a good excuse to positively assert that god is real. I cannot believe in a reason that a god would be needed to create a universe. There. Is my worldview validated off that statement alone?\n\nLastly, most theologians  I've been listening to for the last few days suggest that God beamed divine truths in the heads in how to worship him, how to react with each other. Certain parts of the old testament are not meant to be taken literally and never have. They tell a truth behind the story.\n\nMy contention with this is..how is this different from literature at all? Did God beam divine truths into Shakespeare? Into Harry Potter? If so, why did he beam barbaric laws such as stoning people for adultery? Stoning kids for disobedience, treating women as property? Are book clubs churchs now since literature contains esoteric moral truths?\n\n\nThat being said I still do appreciate theology from an historic and even religious perspective.(some)  Theology allows believers to amend their religious worldviews to live in the world we live in now. Without theology , we probably would be stuck with religious dogma filled with monarchies and theocracies. pure fundamentalism and that's not good. \n\nEdit: Did you guys read my post before downvoting it? lol.",

However, even then, and as time went on, such organisations were used for humanitarian proposes- in Western Europe, monasteries and convents, for example, were sources of medical care for the local population. However, it has also been a cause of genocide and war- while the viaduct example given is the Crusades, in many ways the colonisation of the so-called 'New World's was fueled by Christian zealotry and partially encouraged by the pope. Perhaps more significant is the militant spread of Islam from the seventh century onwards by the various caliphs who claimed descent from Mohammed which destroyed many local cultures and lead to the creation of theocratic role over the Middle East, Persia and Iberia for millennia. The question is, has organised religion been an overall force for good, or has it had an overall negative impact?\n\nEDIT- sorted out the poor grammar of the last sentence.",

Using logic, reason, and real world examples may get their attention - but are always overridden by their interpretation of scripture.\n\nDuring the discussion I learned something about some of the people and suspected it about others.  These people suffered rape, abuse, drug addiction in their past.  They have lived openly gay (sinful) lifestyles before finding their faith.  They would mention episodes in their past of leaving the church, going back to their evil (gay) ways and then seeing the light again and going back to their religion.\n\nThere was also a lot of blurring the lines between trans people, homosexuals, pedophiles, in their eyes.  At first I thought that this was due to their interpretation of the scripture but then I thought it could be something else, something horrifying.\n\nThe abuse and rape that was described was terrible - and I can see how someone who experiences that as their first sexual experiences may grow up to have a twisted view on love and sex - and could even become a predator themselves!\n\nI also thought of how nobody hates an alcoholic more than a recovering alcoholic and also how people who lie themselves are the ones who are the most distrustful of others.  More dots started connecting in my mind.\n\nIn the beginning of the conversation I had been trying to show them that their beliefs were causing innocent (trans) people to be harmed and that is kinda against what Jesus taught.  \n\nTowards the end of the conversation I was convinced that their religion and their faith was probably one of the only things that kept these people from being sexual predators themselves.  \n\nI had spent hours trying to separate them from their faith thinking that it was the reason for their fear and hate for those who are different.  Instead I was separating them from the one thing that was keeping them from being predators themselves.  I feel like such an ass.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?\n\nTL;DR : Spent hours trying to challenge people's faith only to come away thinking their faith was what was keeping them from harming other people.\n\nUPDATE : Here was the end of the conversation : [End of Facebook Conversation about the Trans Bathroom Laws](http://i.imgur.com/ONM4qI1.png) - I had my first ever comment removed by Facebook for breaking community guidelines.  The comment was \"I love you &lt;OP's friend&gt; so much, even if you don't realize it.  I love you even if you don't love yourself\".

        "text": "Edit: Before you read this, My thesis is not \"Souls exist\". My thesis is \"How I shifted away from pure natural materialism\". I currently think there is more than just the natural and material. That is my thesis. Some folks are missing that, and I want to make it more clear. \n\nSomething I run into a lot being in the Secular Student Alliance is Secular Theism. People get rid of the religion mostly due to the \"hatred\" it spreads. The recent homosexuality issues in America, and abroad, have made a lot of youngsters angry at organized religion. Organized religions among the young is fading quickly, but what isn't fading quickly is the belief in \"Something out there.\"\n\nI see it All. The. Time. Now I would say the vast majority of these people just haven't thought through it all the way. Sometimes in life we get faced with hard problems that we don't know how to solve, but we cannot let these unsolvable problems keep us up at night; we have to live our lives. A lot of people, then, develop \"working answers\" to their problem in order to live with it. \n\nBut, then some years pass, and something brings that problem back up. You look at it with fresh more educated eyes and see the errors in your working answer. You develop a new one or actually answer the question instead of finding an answer you can live with. \n\nThis is where these secular theists come into play. They struggle with the problems of religion, but of course, no religion does not equal no god. They are two separate, though similar, questions. Some folks go religion shopping (Buddhism is hot right now), while others ditch the religions, and keep the god belief. As they enter into groups like the SSA, they are challenged again and realize maybe there is nothing else. Why does there have to be a higher power? a purpose? something else? \n\nI have found myself in kind of an opposite position. I am a pretty strong atheist.When I left religion, I left it ALL. I would have considered myself a natural materialist until my philosophy minor brought me to a lot of different ways of thinking. Ive since dropped the naturalist mindset (dont worry science is still an awesome truth finding tool, Im not crazy). Recently, I've been pondering questions of the soul, immortality, eternal etc etc. The one question that has really driven all of this comes from William Rowe's response to the Cosmological Argument. \n\nI am going to assume you are a seasoned atheist familiar with Aquinas's Third Way, give it a google if you are not, where Aquinas is trying to make a logical proof for the existence of a self-existent being, and this being would be the thing everyone calls God. Rowe directs his attention at this argument. \n\nThe problem Aquinas posits is that N can be explained by N+1 and that by N+2, but this cannot go on forever. There must be a first in the series. There must be a first cause. Rowe says no there does not. \n\nFor starters Aquinas gives no reason why there cannot be an infinite, but nevermind that. What Aquinas is really getting at is not there has to be a first cause. N can be explained easily by the one before it and the one before that, and in an infinite, all in the series would be accounted for. What is not accounted for however is the *series itself*? or in other words, ***Why is there something as opposed to nothing?*****\n\nThis question is said to have kept Rowe up at night trying to find an answer. He eventually just says, I dunno. Maybe there is no reason. Maybe it just is. \n\nThis of course is puzzling to me too. I am prepared to accept there may not be an answer, but boy does it strain the ol' noggin. I mean what the fuck IS existence? Is there anything outside of this? What was before? What comes after? What *is* **this?**\n\nThese question lead me to reexamine my position on spirituality, the soul etc. And these days I find myself leaning more toward the idea of a soul. Or at least something spiritual or supernatural at work in the universe. Now, I won't truly believe in this until further evidence, and I certainly won't preach it. Nonetheless, I'm somewhat of an atheist with some soul. ",

Of course they may be right on a macro-level (wars, terrorism, sowing division etc.), but for the individual, it does seem that religion may be such a deeply entrenched part of being human because it's of benefit to us, like many other deeply entrenched human behaviours.",

        "text": "I am currently a sophomore in a very small Christian private school located within Virginia, and I am looking for some advice regarding my current situations and experiences within this strictly religious school. \n\nI have been attending this school since my 2nd grade year, and I have been in a private schooling environment my whole life. Initially, I did not mind this as a young child, but I have a very strong desire to attend public school currently. I come from a family that is split religiously. My father and his side of the family are devout Christians, and pay the tuition for me to attend a private school. My mother's side of the family is nonreligious, but still agrees with sending me to a private school because of their past experiences with other children in private schools as a student. After their split, they still have me enrolled in a Christian private school. She also has me enrolled at this Christian school because of their college enrollment program. To elaborate, I am currently taking a religious philosophy course to earn college credits at a private college (that I don't plan on attending in the future).\n\nI have nothing against the church, and I have no problems with others holding religious beliefs. However, my problems arose when many teachers and students in my already small school discovered my lack of religious beliefs. Over the past several years, my experiences with the school declined rapidly. On many occasions other students would say in an aggressive manner that I was going to burn in hell, clearly not out of love but out of hate for me. Teachers have refused to act on these open attacks against me; they have actually agreed in some ways with the students that have made these attacks against me. Furthermore, I disagree with how they view evolution and the Big Bang Theory. I strongly believe that anything without proof does not belong in a scientific field, so I was always more inclined to believe in natural, secular explanation rather than God. As expected, the church disagrees with these points of view, but I believe that they should at least teach them as part of the science courses. There was one last action of the church that has spurred all this frustration. I was called down to the chapel by another student on one occasion. After I had arrived they guided me to the altar and prevented me from leaving the chapel. Students began to pray over me, hold my hands at the center of my palms, and openly asked for God to remove the 'demons' from me. This was highly offensive, as it implies my natural soul and characteristics are demonic in some way, when I am actually a very self-controlled person. \n\nI am just wondering what I could possibly do to convince my mother to remove me from my current school and allow me to attend a secular establishment. If this is not possible, I also ask that you suggest me with various ways to improve my stay for my remaining two years at the school. Any additional comments on my situation are also requested, as I would like other's viewpoints and opinions on the matter.",

Eventually, their arguments became more compelling, and I learned more about the world and such, so I stopped believing.  \n\nI haven't had any huge debates with Christians until relatively recently, but what I've noticed is the ones I've debated with (my parents and people involved in their fundie church) seem completely impervious to logic and reason.  I gave what I felt was a perfectly good argument, but they keep repeating the same things over and over, even when I've demonstrated they're wrong.  Or they'll bring up some point that is completely irrelevant.  I should note I have Aspergers, so I tend to think in black and white, etc and giving me an irrational, non-sequitur answer is like presenting a robot with a logical conundrum (\"does not compute!\").  I don't really know how to deal with it.\n\nI'm beginning to think they just say anything to drown out the sound of the \"still small voice\" of doubt in the back of their minds.  \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies.  I realise now my method of trying to beat them with facts isn't going to work.  I'll look into Street Epistemology, as it seems like it could be more effective.\n\nBtw, some of the arguments we had involved LGBT rights, etc rather than the existence of God.  Can techniques like Street Epistemology be used to help Christians become more accepting?  If people want to believe in magic sky fairies then that's fine but not if they use it as an excuse to discriminate.",

I mean I here the same logical mistakes and problematic arguments over and over, so at this point, its just a game. You say this, I say that and we're done here. \n\nRecently, we held our group's main Spring event, Ask an Atheist Day. Self explanatory event. The secretary and myself were using the campus resource room to make a nice sign for it. Had the word ATHEISTS in big bold letters on it. We were painting this in the middle of a fairly traffic heavy area. We had a lot of people come up as we often do with anything our group does. \n\nWe get some sympathizers and supporters, way more than you'd think. And we get christians. This one gentleman walks up, and he asks what this is. I tell him. He explains he is a christian. Ok. \"And now I don't want to start anything with you, but I just want you to know God loves you.\" \n\n\"Cool, how do you know.\" \n\n\"How what?\"\n\n\"How do you know God loves me?\"\n\n\"Well, I know God is real and I know he loves you. He loves all of us.\"\n\n\"Yea, I get that.

I mean is this for me or is this for you? 'Cause I don't believe in God, so telling me he love's me doesn't do much for me.\" \n\n\"I'm not trying to start anything.\"\n\n\"Ok, well hey great talking to you.\"\n\nI haven't gotten mad, or been this disrespectful in a long time.

        "text": "I am an ex-Muslim, and after looking through this sub and other Western dominated religious subs, I can't help but grin at the Christian arguments. For instance, there is currently a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/4izbym/how_do_we_know_jesusgod_arent_real/) in this sub where the Christian OP says:\n\n&gt;I believe there is a God. I don't know who or what or why or explain anything about it, I just believe there is one.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, this theist has come to the conclusion of Christianity. I am in a Arab country, and most people make no distinction between theism and Islam. If you believe in God, you *must* be Muslim. What else could you be? It's quite funny to see Christ-worshipers make the same leap.\n\nThis kind of logic really underpins every religion. There is never any real reason to believe, only \"I feel it in my heart,\" combined with an ample lack of perspective regrading all the other religious people who claim the same.\n\nBut what is most astounding is that this intellectual void extends to the 'great' apologists as well. As many of you (?) are former Christ-worshipers, I assume some of you are familiar with the story of Augustine of Hippo. Augustine rejected religion, but one day he was in a garden and thought he heard a voice which said \"read.\" He rushed to find a book, and the closest book was the Bible. He read a part of Romans, related to it, and interpreted this as \"proof\" of Christianity.\n\nWhen I first read this story, it immediately struck me as parallel to that of a prominent Muslim philosopher from the Medieval period, al-Ghazali. In his autobiography *Deliverance From Error,* al-Ghazali wrote:\n\n&gt;When [doubt] had occurred to me and penetrated my being, I tried to find some way of treating my unhealthy condition; but it was not easy. Such ideas can only be repelled by demonstration; but a demonstration requires a knowledge of first principles; since this is not admitted, however, it is impossible to make the demonstration. The disease was baffling, and lasted almost two months, during which I was a skeptic in fact though not in theory nor in outward expression. At length Allah cured me of the malady; my being was restored to health and an even balance; the necessary truths of the intellect became once more accepted, as I regained confidence in their certain and trustworthy character.\n\n&gt;This did not come about by systematic demonstration or marshaled argument, but by a light which Allah most high cast into my breast. That light is the key to the greater part of knowledge. Whoever thinks that the understanding of things Divine rests upon strict proofs has in his thought narrowed down the wideness of Allah’s mercy.\n\nAnd this sentiment is echoed in another apologist in the current era - William Lane Craig. In *Reasonable Faith,* Craig writes:\n\n&gt;The way in which I know Christianity is true is first and foremost on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit in my heart. And this gives me a self-authenticating means of knowing Christianity is true wholly apart from the evidence. And therefore, even if in some historically contingent circumstances the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity, I do not think that this controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit.\n\nCraig elsewhere asserts, as al-Ghazali did, that reason and evidence alone cannot support religion in anyway, and are best used as tools merely to solidify pre-determined belief.\n\nI do not know about the Christian world, but in the Middle East religion is assumed to have some sort of intellectual support. It is assumed that religion is true not only because of personal experience, but because of the logical arguments and proofs made by many great scholars. \n\nOne of the key things which made me abandon fantasy was my investigations into the scholars and apologists, and the realization that there is no reason, no logic, no method to their beliefs. Sure, there is a veneer of such. They conjure up attempted proofs by logic and similar games to try and trick the weak minded. But all these are reliant on a pre-existing decision to believe, a decision made in utter absence of logic.\n\nA decision made in intellectual void.\n\nAnd from this intellectual void, the dishonestly of the apologists is emanated, as the Greeks once argued existence emanates from a First Cause. The utter dishonestly of assuming a conclusion is true, and only then trying to support it. The level of oblivion one must seep themselves in to deny that their emotions are no better than those of other believers. \n\nThis ignorance is tolerable, perhaps even expected, from the average believer, but its prominent display in religious intellectuals never ceases to astound me.

Under cross-examination from prosecutors, Grimmet said Dear had an intact memory, appeared coherent and goal-oriented and familiar with facts of the case.\"\n\nFrom the New York Times article:\n\"Mr. Dear has described the Planned Parenthood clinic that he struck as the most evil place in the world.\n\nHe engaged in an hourslong standoff with the police before surrendering. He later told a detective that he had decided to surrender because he had flipped a card while he was in a back room of the Planned Parenthood building, pinned down by the police. He said he had taken it as a message from God.\"\n\nSo, am I alone in thinking that the majority of what the court is ruling \"delusion\" is his religious beliefs?  That thousands of babies are going to greet him in Heaven and thank him?  \n\nEvery article I've read has stated that he understand the charges brought against and wants to plead guilty.  And he has specifically railed against being declared incompetent because it would lead to him being medicated against his will.  \n\nI mean, he does have a lot of paranoid beliefs about government spying and the like, but I haven't read anything that was ludicrous.  It's not like he is saying sky lizards are invading his brain waves.\n\nIt just seems to me that every agency involved in this case is trying super, super hard not to say that he took his religious beliefs to what one could justify as their logical conclusions and acted upon them.  And, to be clear, while I don't personally consider religious belief itself to be a mental disorder, I do correlate the more extreme the adherence to a greater degree of mental derangement.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nAs an atheist, I was never satisfied by Plato's Allegory of the Cave. It seems to assume that we can escape this world to get to the pure, true, and real Form World, even during this life. Of course, as all you atheists know, that's not possible.\n\nI'm wondering what you think of this allegory:\n\nOn a large ocean is a boat. In the boat is a large family which has been at sea for as long as anyone can remember. Some are fishermen; others crew. Those who die are buried at sea, for there is no room in the boat.\n\nNow, some say there is Land out there somewhere. Others say there is no Land.\n\nThe first group points out that the family doesn't seem to be native solely to water; also, that the boat is made of materials not usually found flouting out at sea. They say the family needs to set a course to get to Land. Many agree that life on the boat is less important than setting a course for Land.\n\nThe second group point out that chroniclers can't find records of a time when the family was actually on Land. Some say the hopes of Land are projections of the imagination. Others say the claims of Land are merely stories made up by people who want to become Captain. Almost all of these agree that we must improve life on the boat rather than set a course through icebergs and other threats.\n\nMany fights have occurred between both groups, and within each group. Only one thing is agreed on by all: that some family members *seem* able to conjure Land out of thin air, to repair the boat once in a while. Everyone agrees that this is important, though they can't agree why or how it is.\n\nNow, the Sea is the Universe/Matter. The Land is God/Heaven. The boat is human nature. Those who seem able to conjure \"Land\" from thin air are the artists and others who gentle the human condition with beauty.\n\nTo me, this seems to be an accurate allegory of our search for meaning.",

        "text": "As a lifelong atheist, when I go to Church every week for Mass (my fiancee is a practicing Catholic) I decide to really get into it. In other words, I get into the head of a believer as best as I can and, when she prays (we pray together) I do the same. It's sort of like \"method acting\" and I really enjoy the head and feelings I get when in that state, so much that I actually look forward to going to Mass and praying with my fiancee. Needless to say, she loves it as much as I do, so it's a lot of fun for me.\n\nOf course my curiosity gets the better of me, so I've been reading a lot of literature about the meaning of the Mass and why people pray (even atheists do so, but not to a Christian concept of God, more along some nebulous \"higher self\" or something such). So now that I have a somewhat good idea of the meaning of the Mass and praying, it gives it all more emotional/intellectual significance to me. And, realizing that we humans share our humanity by definition I can find a lot of things that I can identify with in terms of the morals, hopes we all share, and lots more.\n\nThis has led me to do something I've never done before. Most of the literature I've read on these subjects (the Mass, praying, etc.) references sections of the Bible and the Catechism as the origins for these rituals. So, being the type of person I am, I like to go to the source of the investigation, so to speak. So, yea, I bought a Bible, after researching which one is the most accepted by scholars on the subject, and, though I do read the passages, I most enjoy reading the notes on the historical aspects of the words, etc. It's to the point, now, where I think I know more about my fiancee's religion than she does. So, now, along with my usual readings on cosmological and partical physics, I may enjoy reading my Bible. I sometimes laugh at the seeming incongruity of this. :)\n\nIt's all done in my never ending quest for knowledge. I'm an information sponge. Each time I've learned something it changes the way I look at our universe, people, etc. For me, knowing the make-up of something, whether it's a star and quantum physical realities or why someone believes what they do, just adds to my appreciation of everything else.\n\nSo, now, when I go to some event, in this case a religiously based or conceived function (wedding, funeral, etc.) I appreciate the customs in a more fundamental way that affects the whole of me, intellectual and emotional, and not only don't mind participating, but enjoy doing so because I'm able to get into that head in a more deeper way, through knowledge. As for God, now that I've learned about this very human phenomena, I have no problem believing, even if it's only for that moment of time and, yes, even though I'm an atheist.",

        "text": "Many theists have claimed Maydole's ontological argument from the the Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology has never been refuted, I am presenting a refutation based on and expanded from a discussion [here.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive255#Robert_Maydole.27s_Ontological_argument)\n\nMaydole's full presentation of the argument can be [read here;](https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/maydole-robert-22the-ontological-argument22.pdf) I would encourage everyone to do so, though I will summarize.\n\nMaydole's argument is a revision of Aquinas' third way. Maydole admits some of the premises are only possible and not necessary - that is, they are true in some possible world even if they are false in another. The rest he classifies as *necessary true,* that is, true is all possible realities. He argues that if there is some possible world in which T1 through T14 are all true, then a supreme being exists in all worlds, including this one.\n\nThe argument is:\n\nT1: Something presently exists.\n\nT2: Only finitely many things have existed to date.\n\nT3: Every temporally contingent being begins to exist at some time and ceases to exist at some time.\n\nT4: Everything that begins to exist at some time and ceases to exist at some time exists for a finite period of time.\n\nT5: If everything exists for only a finite period of time, and there have been only finitely many beings to date, then there was a time when nothing existed.\n\nT6: If there was a time when nothing existed, then nothing presently exists.\n\nT7: A being is temporally necessary if and only if it is not temporally contingent.\n\nT8: Everything has a sufficient reason for its existence.\n\nT9: Anything that has a sufficient reason for its existence also has a sufficient reason for its existence that is a sufficient reason for its own existence.\n\nT10: No temporally contingent being is a sufficient reason for the existence of a temporally necessary being.\n\nT11: Every temporally necessary being that is a sufficient reason for its own existence is a being without any limitations.\n\nT12: A being without any limitations is necessarily greater than any other being.\n\nT13: It is not possible for anything to be greater than itself.\n\nT14: It is necessarily the case that “greater than” is asymmetric.\n\nTherefore,\n\nT15: There exists a supreme being.\n\nIgnoring the problems with a proof by logic, and an ontological argument in general, we're going to look at some of these premises, especially T5.\n\nWe run into an assertion right away at T2, \"Only finitely many things have existed to date.\" This rests on the assumption of an A theory of time, and Maydole supports this using the same logic William Lane Craig uses to support al-Ghazali's kalaam; thus, the refutation the kalaam applies.\n\nT6, \"If there was a time when nothing existed, then nothing presently exists,\" is begging the question in the same way the first premise of al-Ghazali's kalaam, \"everything that begins to exist has a cause,\" does; it assumes the existence of an infinite being preceding temporal reality.\n\nT8, \"everything has a sufficient reason for its existence,\" is just an assertion, although Maydole argues it is a likely assertion. T9 and T10 follow from T8 and deal with \"sufficient reasons,\" these statements are internally valid, but, again, just assertions.\n\nMaydole's Thomasian background becomes apparent with T11; \"every temporally necessary being that is a sufficient reason for its own existence is a being without any limitations.\" This is a very similar concept to the \"self-intellectualizing, self-actualizing\" First Cause proposed by the Classical philosophers in their emanationist models, which were modified for the Abrahamic religions by the great thinkers al-Farabi, Augustine, Ibn Rushd, and, of course, Aquinas himself. Of course, the emanationist cosmological model has been replaced by modern cosmology, and so T11 seems to be another assertion.\n\nThe other premises are, for the most part, logically sound or at least *acceptable.* Maydole, recalling his classification of all of the premises as either possible or necessary, can dismiss the problems above since the premises in question are classified as merely possible (true in some worlds even if not true in all). However, it is important to note the unjustified nature of those premises regardless. We will now take a more in depth look at T5 specifically, which Maydole argues is necessary true (true in all cases).\n\nT5 states: \"If everything exists for only a finite period of time, and there have been only finitely many beings to date, then there was a time when nothing existed.\" Maydole argues this is necessarily true. T5 is necessary - either true in all worlds or in none - but it is actually necessarily false.\n\nLet us imagine a possible world in which time is circular, and thus the far future is equivalent to the far past. In this world, time is still finite, which means everything that exists will only exist for a finite time and there have only been finitely many things to exist - thus fitting with Maydole's other premises.\n\nIn this world, there is no reason to believe that there was a time in which nothing ever existed, as there could easily have been something existing at every moment of time. Hence, there is a reality in which T5 is false, and since T5 is necessarily, it is necessarily false. Thus, T6 - and the rest of the argument - collapse.\n\nShout out to r/exmuslim for any former or current Muslims reading this, come join us insh'allah :)",

        "text": "EDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for all of your responses. I will do my best to respond to people as quickly as I can... I am currently spending the day with my mother and she absolutely **hates** seeing me use my phone when we're supposed to be spending quality time together. I will get back to everyone very soon though!\n\n\nOkay, so this is kind of a long story, but I'll include a TL;DR at the end. If you do read everything though, thanks!\n\nSo I have this co-worker (nineteen, male, christian.) He started working at our job around the same time I did (twenty-one, female, atheist), so we became friends out of mutual new-person status. This was about six months ago. We get along well, but are friends solely at work. \n\nMaybe three months ago we started having some serious discussions involving a lot of our personal views, which are incredibly different. Things ranging from abortion rights, to spanking your kids, to evolution vs. creationism, and then almost always leading back to religious conversations. He is one of my only co-workers who outright knows that I'm an atheist... I'm cautious about discussing it after it caused some issues at my last job. Our conversations are always cordial, and rarely get heated, because we are both open minded and good at keeping a level head. Occasionally we get a little over-passionate about a subject, but no feelings are ever hurt and we both enjoy the intelligent conversation.\n\nNow the thing about this guy... He may be young but he is *really* smart. He seems to have a strong grasp on how the world works, and is mature way beyond his years. Probably even more so than I am in some ways, and I'm two years older than he is. This is why it has always been sort of baffling to me that he is such a loyal Christian. Not that there aren't intelligent Christians... I'm not saying that at all. But he seems to have never doubted, or even *questioned* it in the slightest.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I'm worried I might have gotten in his head a little. We were talking about how religion *initially* enters peoples lives, and he asked me what I meant when I said the word \"indoctrination\". I said to him to imagine he had been born in a middle eastern, primarily Muslim country. Exactly the same human, but born on a different continent with a different primary religion. I asked him if he would still be a christian. He then paused, for a long time. He half heartedly said \"Well, maybe.\" and then dropped the subject. It never occured to me that he wouldn't have ever even considered this notion, but he seemed genuinely perplexed by the idea that the only reason he is a christian is because he was born to other christians, in a country full of christians.\n\nThen, two nights ago, he was listening to a rap song that I don't know the artist of, and the musician was clearly non-religious based on what he was saying. Mind you, we had another co-worker in the office at the time, and my friend was showing this song to the random other guy. The song had some serious lyrics referring to being non-religious and I could not hide my shock to hear my friend listening to this song. I half-jokingly say to him that I know him well enough at this point to be very surprised to hear him listening to something like that. He didn't really respond specifically to that statement, but later refers to a quote in the song that says \"ignorance is bliss\". The entire conversation following this was very vague... I believe this is because there was an extra person in the room. He is aware that I don't advertise my atheism. He then proceeds to ask me if I believe that, and asks me if I believe that ignorance = innocence; I.e. if you are ignorant to a subject, does that automatically equate to an innocence or naivety? I was kind of floored, because in the context of the conversation, there was definitely a heavy implication there. I responded that I believe that ignorance  only qualifies as innocence if you are truly unaware of a piece of knowledge. I said that if you have been presented the chance to learn something enough times that you are aware that you are purposefully avoiding said knowledge, then you are definitely not innocent to it. Purposeful ignorance vs. natural ignorance, basically.\n\nI wish I remembered word for word the exchange a little better. But he basically asked me if it is okay to deny something that you fear to be true, out of an innocent desire to stay happy. It sounds like he is questioning his faith.\n\nAnd now I have absolutely no clue what to do. I'm scared that I set this off in him in some way. I don't want to pressure him at all, one way or the other. I don't believe that is my place. However, I know how incredibly hard it is to have to question your faith, faith that you're raised with. It's *hard* to consider the possibility that everything you've known might not be true. I was raised in an evangelical household. I fell into a year-long depression trying to come to terms with my quickly diminishing faith. It is very painful to accept that when you die, it's possible that nothing happens. That, maybe, every time you've prayed, it's been to nothingness. I don't know the extent to which he may be wavering, but if this is a result of something I said, I don't want to leave him hanging. I'm relatively sure that I am one of, if not *the only* atheist that he knows. But I also don't want to cross a professional boundary or risk freaking him out, or make him feel pressured. I have no idea how to handle this recent incident.\n\nI'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask about this. I wasn't entirely sure if their was an atheist-advice subreddit, or a specific area for stuff like this. I could really use some help though. Thank you!\n\nTL;DR:  Co-worker/friend is a christian. I am an atheist. A comment I made in a conversation about religion may have led to him questioning his faith, or aggitated a questioning he may have already had that I was unaware of. I don't want to leave him unsupported during what might be a very difficult struggle (that I myself have lived), but also don't want to overstep professional boundaries.",

The Bible is specific in forbidding homosexuality, but there is not a verse saying \"A man shalt not use a woman's chamber pot.\" Most of the verses cited by articles such as this one ( http://www.christianpost.com/news/what-does-the-bible-say-about-trans-gender-identity-105311/ ) have been construed in very odd ways to apply to transgender people.\n\nSome verses effectively say \"when God made you, he knew what he was doing,\" but that argument could be applied to forbid all kinds of things. Why circumcise, for example, if God intended man to be that way? Other verses that are cited by the article forbid male prostitution or homosexuality, but those are obviously different. One verse says something to the effect of \"A woman shalt not wear a man's clothes, and vice versa.\" But this would forbid a woman from wearing pants (by the standards of the time). Most modern Christians don't have a problem with that.\n\nAll of the arguments I've seen that use the Bible as the basis to forbid being transgender seem quite shaky. That leads me to wonder whether the intolerance that many (but not all) Christians show towards transgender people has anything to do with \"God,\" or instead a habit of intolerance that has been cultivated by a lifetime of religious conviction. Perhaps this is how many Christians can quote Leviticus while still wearing clothes of mixed fabrics? \n\nAm I missing something? Is there a way to explain why many Christians dislike transgender people through the text of the Bible, or are they just arbitrarily persecuting a group of people for being different?\n\nI can understand someone wanting to follow the text of an old book in the hopes of being granted immortal life. But if the Bible doesn't even forbid being transgender, then it seems to be a sad commentary on Christianity to see that so many people hold intolerances that aren't even explained by their holy book.

What is your view of the Bible? How do you react to the Christian belief that Jesus is the only way to God? Are there things you like about Christianity? Are there things you don't like? Are there any questions you have about Christian beliefs? How would you describe the role spirituality or religion plays in your life, if any? How would you describe the role a higher power plays in your life, if any? Would you describe yourself as having a relationship with a higher power? Do you think it makes a difference in a person's life if they give a high priority to a higher power and spirituality? What are some of the top values by which you live and why do you hold them? Are your life values and purpose at all related to your beliefs about a higher power and spirituality?",

        "text": "First time poster here... really enjoy reading the content from this community.\n\nMy catholic mother shared this \"sample lesson\" with me and I found it pretty interesting (and at times a little bold). Recently, I've been perceiving that Catholicism and it's beliefs are not nearly as \"out there\" as some of the other sects of Christianity, but some of the info in here is making me feel a little weird. I am curious to your thoughts as I will likely be having a civilized discussion about this in the future.\n\nhttp://www.wordonfire.org/wof-site/media/mystery-of-god---sample-lesson.pdf\n\nSpecifically *the argument from desire* (pg 10):\n\n&gt; **(1)** Every natural, innate desire is us corresponds to some real object that can satisfy that desire.\n\n&gt;  **(2)** But there exists in us a desire which nothing in time, nothin on earth, no creature can satisfy.\n\n&gt;**(3)** Therefore there must exist something more than time, earth, and creatures, which can satisfy this desire.\n\n&gt; **(4)** This something is what people call \"God\" and \"life with God forever\"\n\nHow does one go about making the claim for **(2)**? is this based in evidence or maybe it just comes down to what you believe?\n\nAlso this passage (pg 8):\n&gt; The world only exists because God exists, and it's impossible for God not to exist because he is existence. He just *is*. Now, that doesn't mean God is *identical* to the physical universe. That is a belief known as pantheism. Instead, God is *distinct* from a universe that both doesn't have to exist and only still exists because God wills that to be the case. That's why an atheist's demand that God's existence be proven scientifically is a non-starter. God is not a being in the universe that can be discovered through scientific investigation. He is instead Being itself, which sustains the universe, and his existence is demonstrated through philosophical reflection.&gt; \n\nI often times hear the claims that God is something.. God **is** existence, God **is** love almost to say that since those things exists, God must exist. But it's really hard to quantify what those things are (maybe that's just me trying to prove scientifically). What is existence and what is love? (baby don't hurt me)...",

To my atheist cousin, the bible may not be the word of God, but it does offer hidden allegorical details about how other savage races were.\n\nI had a discussion with my relative the other day and my relative is telling me about man being existence for trillions of years as one race before other races were genetically grafted. I asked them to provide evidence. How can man be older than the universe? \"We existed in another form(bullshit answer).  He then went on to discuss Our race having a superior conscious and spirituality level than other races. So I asked him, what is the process of measuring spirituality? How can you measure consciousness? What's the method being used here?\n\n\"Oh, the Egyptians had a way. Just because we don't have the method, doesn't mean they didn't.\" He said. In other words, The absence of evidence isn't the evidence of absence.\n\nIf you don't have a method and can't back up your claims, then what you are believing in is dogma, its religion. It's baseless unless you can provide the evidence for your empirical claims. \"Well, it makes common sense to me.\" If common sense was the ultimate measurement, we wouldn't *need* science.\n\nAs a person that values education, its disheartening to see members of my family fall into this pseudo-science racist theological trap.

Large sections of relatives know of my atheism, but we do not engage in dialogue or debate. I do not engage in the topic whatsoever with anyone from my past life, except those whom I have told personally that I am atheist and I know accept me and respect me for it regardless.\n\nHowever, I feel like I am cheating the very notion that brought me out of religion in the first place: confronting misinformation and arguing with those whom I disagree with. Ironically (as for many of us), my pursuit to defend the faith has turned me against it, but the search for truth and clear logic is a value that remains.\n\nSo, it seems I'm at a bit of an impasse. I would love to engage family members in respectful and meaningful conversation about this topic, obviously with the intention of convincing them that their religion is not an empirically strong stance. However, I also run the risk of ruining relationships I care about. Many of my relatives already avoid me a bit, especially a lot of the cousins that I love to see and hang out with, as their parents tell them to steer clear.\n\nLike I said, though: the same internal conflict that led to reveal my atheism to my parents is pushing me to engage in the debate and speak up. However, the cost can be high. \n\nIn addition to requesting input on my own personal position, could some perhaps comment on why it is necessary (or is not) to engage in personal debates when the increasing emphasis on empiricism and education is leading to ever-decreasing rates of religious belief in modernized countries, even now, the US? It is or is it not necessary to engage in the debate in our personal lives at the potential cost alienating people that can't engage in the topic without taking grave offense?",

        "text": "The more I learn about the origins, beliefs, what the Bible actually says, etc the more people who actually believe this stuff terrify me.\n\nFor example, I've started reading Forged, and the fact people actually devote their lives to the Bible, when we don't even know who wrote most of it, both confounds and frightens me.  The power of indoctrination is terrifying.  It feels like when I talk to Christians I'm talking to a pod person.  \n\nAnyone else feel this way? How do you deal with it?",

        "text": "He's read the first chapter, and more will come:\n\nhttps://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/the-end-of-faith-sessions-1\n\nThis gives voice, reason, and researched study to many of the intuitions that led many of us away from the religions of our birth. \n\nThis subreddit gets a lot of interest from people who are just starting their journey away from faith and Sam's work cuts through the dogma, tradition, and tribalism that has stifled human kind under the guise of benign belief.  If you want to know where the whole \"New Atheist\" thing started, this is it.\n\nHere is what Dawkins had to say about The End of Faith:\n\n&gt;*\"The End of Faith by Sam Harris is a genuinely frightening book about terrorism, and the central role played by religion in justifying and rewarding it. Others blame “extremists” who “distort” the “true” message of religion. Harris goes to the root of the problem: religion itself. Even moderate religion is a menace, because it leads us to respect and “cherish the idea that certain fantastic propositions can be believed without evidence”. Why do men like Bin Laden commit their hideous cruelties? The answer is that they “actually believe what they say they believe”. Read Sam Harris and wake up.\"* \n\nSam even mentions that his attack on moderates is what made this book most controversial. I've seen for years, as an adult living in Texas, that religious moderates give cover and support to extremists.  It's why our state schools regulator, The TEA, is riddled with Bible literalists who want ID and even YEC taught in Biology.  When elections become faith tests, only the ostensibly religious will be elected. \n\nI wouldn't normally post a podcast, but I'm a fan of this community and this is kindof a big deal and a great resource. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n",

They were not together at the time but they both report hearing a voice talking and speaking to them the exact same words. How can science explain this if they are not unstable.",

Are any of you kinda, disappointed in that? That you just stop existing, and you won't have any recollection of any of your family, friends, good moments, or well, ANYTHING. You don't know you're dead, you don't think, you just.... don't. I personally find this pretty disappointing, it could just be the kid in me but I'd like to hope that you'd get to spend forever doing WHATEVER with WHOEVER you want. My question is I guess \"do you really want things to be like this and if you could change it what would you want to happen instead?\".",

        "text": "Couldn't think of a good topic title.\n\nMy father does not believe in evolution.  Claims there is 0 science behind it.  He will quote constantly about scientists who faked their research to get grants and accolades.  Some of it true.  And how LUCY is a joke and they put fake knees, hands, feet on an ape and call it a human ancestor.  And he's also not wrong there.  There's too much controversy over LUCY to use it as a basis of evidence.  But none of that disproves the whole theory.  I've given him the [TalkOrigins List](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/) but he'll probably just argue that all the science is wrong.  So depending on some replies, I may argue with you like he would.\n\nI will never convince him that his God is fiction.  But I've already convinced him that Hell isn't real.  It's figurative and possibly just means \"Not with God\".  So us atheists just die, christians go to eternal bliss.  I have also convinced him that MAYBE the Earth is older than 10-20k years old.  I got a maybe there.  He won't bend on evolution.  I need some firepower, but I need it to be more logical and less scientific.  Got anything for me? =)\n\nEDIT:  To be clear.  My father believes in micro evolution.  Things change over time.  What he will argue is that macro evolution is not possible.  Even with 4billion years a dog can never evolve into a cat.  DNA does not allow things to change or mutate beyond their \"kinds\".  Yes he succombs to Ken Ham's \"kinds\".  *cringe*  I have explained that given a million years a dog may look and act so dramatically different that we are forced to reclassify its species.  He will just say there is no proof that can ever happen or ever has.  Even though I have pointed to such cases inside talkorigins for example.",

        "text": "This is just a thread I notice when talking with other atheists or seeing things posted online.\n\nWhy does my not wanting to be a part of an organized religion make people feel I have to substitute it with an organized anti-religion? What makes some atheists feel we are \"like-minded\" and have similar political demands just because we both happen to not believe in a deity? That is like one single thing. Atheism is a huge tent. There's all sorts of political ideologies, opinions on religion.  I think my atheism makes me more open and accepting of other people's personal religious views because of my journey into atheism.  Some people go the other way.  And that's fine I think.  I just really dislike any attempts at groups within atheism \"speaking for atheists\" or \"representing atheist views\", or groups outside of atheism trying to pigeonhole us all together, when those views are highly individualized.  We're not a group of non-believers.  We're individuals with a label, and not a very descriptive label at that.\n\nEdit: There are of course religious political groups out there fighting for some kind of theocratic-politcal system, and yes that's very troubling, but I don't think that battle necessarily should be fought on a religious vs. atheist front.  There are more than plenty religious people that know the dangers of subscribing to one political faith I hope. I would prefer to see just the basic forces of liberty and freedom of religion stand up against those intrusions. I mean, it's not like those things aren't supposedly built into American democracy.",
