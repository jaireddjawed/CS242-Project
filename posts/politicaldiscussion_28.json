The FBI executed a search warrant and seized the documents including classified ones, in August 2022. The Justice Department was investigating whether these [White House](https://www.c-span.org/organization/?929/White-House) documents were mishandled.

Judge Cannon in her original order noted that although there was no callous disregard of defendant's constitutional rights, she took into consideration the status of the defendant as a former president and also found irreparable harm to reputation.\n\nIn any event, as a matter of practice, however, the appropriate remedy is motion to suppress evidence, or other 4th Amendment violation one charges are filed.     \n\n[The 11th Circuit is poised to 'slam' Judge Aileen Cannon for protecting Trump: former prosecutor (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/the-11th-circuit-is-poised-to-slam-judge-aileen-cannon-for-protecting-trump-former-prosecutor/ar-AA14AgPw?ocid=msedgdhp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=05e2529bbe074ad4a16ce16bb0c1de72)\n\nOral arguments from November 22, 2022, can be heard below.\n\n[Federal Court Hears Case on Mar-a-Lago Seized Documents | C-SPAN.org   ](https://www.c-span.org/video/?524393-1/federal-court-hears-case-mar-lago-seized-dcouments&amp;live)   \n\nShould former presidents be entitled to additional deference or safeguards where there is no criminal pending case.
