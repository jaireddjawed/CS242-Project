The apt itself is fine and I can live with it especially as it’s incredibly cheap compared to a basement suite or actual apartment where I am BUT and for me this is a big but, I absolutely hate sharing a bathroom and shower.\n\nIf anyone has any insight on how I could somehow have my own toilet and shower in my apt I would greatly appreciate it; I want to stay in this apt to build up my credit score and rental history while saving for the down payment on a condo, with this place costing half of other rentals and having everything included I can save very quickly.",

This post is a bit rambling; I'm really just looking for any input/experiences with any of points in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI make \\~80k in the US and would like to keep my rent in the 20-25% of income range max.  This puts me around 1400-1600.  I really would like to save around half my income.  With using tax advantaged accounts, this means living on around 32k a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the main criteria I had were\n\n* Ability to accommodate WFH (enough space, maybe an extra room, relatively quiet)\n   * Generally speaking I want to prioritize mental well being, so that I can continue to perform and shoot for promotions at work\n* Ease of getting outside for a few 5 minute walks a day\n   * Getting a few walks in during the day is something I prioritize, but if it takes 5 minutes to get outside (for example in a high rise) - then it means I can't stretch my walk as long -&gt; wouldn't want to be AFK at work for spans of 10 minutes.\n* A roommate would be a slight positive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome options I'm thinking about are maybe splitting a townhouse rent with someone?  Or maybe \"house hacking\" and paying the mortgage for it while renting a bedroom out.  Has anyone signed a lease for a townhouse with a roommate?  I haven't found many posts about how I'd go about doing that.\n\nOr maybe I'm over idealizing having a relatively quiet place.  Maybe it would be worth looking into options where there are 3-4 people and the rent is significantly lower (\\~$900). Would having one room to sleep/WFH in be a huge drag?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts/resources/tangential info would be really helpful!",

        "text": "Are you tired of spending a fortune on groceries every month? Do you want to save money on your grocery bills without sacrificing the quality of your food? Look no further!\n\nI've compiled a list of the best tips and tricks for saving money on groceries, based on my own experiences and research. Whether you're a student, a family, or a single person, these tips will help you save money and eat well without breaking the bank.\n\n1. Make a list and stick to it. This might seem obvious, but it's amazing how many people go to the grocery store without a plan and end up buying things they don't need. By making a list and sticking to it, you can avoid impulse buys and save money.\n\n2. Buy in bulk. Buying non-perishable items in bulk can save you a lot of money in the long run. Just make sure you have enough storage space and that you'll actually use the items before they expire.\n\n3. Shop around. Don't just go to one grocery store. Check out different stores in your area and compare prices. Some stores have better prices on certain items, and by shopping around, you can save money on your overall grocery bill.\n\n4. Buy generic or store-brand items. Generic and store-brand items are often just as good as their name-brand counterparts, but they cost less. Give them a try and see if you can save money without sacrificing quality.\n\n5. Use coupons and discounts. Coupons and discounts can be a great way to save money on groceries. Look for coupons in newspapers and magazines, and check the websites of your favorite stores for special offers and discounts.\n\nBy following these tips, you can save money on groceries without sacrificing the quality of your food. Happy shopping!",

        "text": "Flatmate insisted on reducing our heating usage to 1-2  hours per day eventhough my flat has terrible insulation, so I decided to look for a cheaper alternative to get warmth. I have a very thick duvet then works really work in maintaining heat when im sleeping. The problem is waking up and embracing the change in temperature whenever I wake up, which has caused me to stay in bed for long hours and always just 1-2 mins on time to work (maybe thats more of a personal procrastination problem).   \n\n\nWould a heated vest be more useful? As I dont see really good one's on amazon thats relatively cheap &lt;£60. Electric blankets are decent but I would rather not wear it around the house and just in my room, compared to a heated vest which I can wear around and even wear it outside.",

        "text": "By law, you are allowed to ferment 500 gallons of beer or wine in your home for your personal use. I’m recently unexpectedly unemployed and have been a home wine fermenter for many years. Pre pandemic, I invested in a large amount of champagne yeast for home wine fermentation and several bags of sugar. \n\nI don’t get all fancy. My fermentation process relies on champagne yeast, sugar, fruit, water, gravity and time. From the thrift store, I bought several gallon glass containers with a spigot on the bottom ( the type used for sun tea) A lot of them come with a tin screwed on cap which I discarded as I feel there will be a problem with rusting. \n\nI put in my thawed fruit (around bag of frozen peaches) 4 thawed condensed apple juice frozen containers with a 1/2 pound of sugar. Add warm water to about 3 inches from top and add in two packets of champagne yeast with warm water from an empty frozen apple apple juice container. You can also use frozen fruit on its way out as a frugal means to stop food waste. \n\nI place a plate on top of glass container and let sit outside (if above freezing) for a month. You want to keep it above 40 degrees as freezing will kill yeast. \n\nThe bottom of container with have about an inch of spent yeast after 3 or 4 weeks. Drain fermented juice into a clean container with bottom spigot. Place clean plate on top. The plate will have enough weight to keep things out but will allow built up gas from fermentation process to escape. Discard 1 inch of juice from bottom with the spent yeast. \n\nFerment the juice until you cannot taste any sweetness. Champagne yeast will make alcohol up to 12%. Anything over 12% alcohol will start to kill yeast. \n\nTo my drinking glass I add 2 parts apple cider to 1 part sake and add Zergut Raspberry syrup to taste. \n\nThis week my fruit blend will contain thawed 2 lbs frozen cranberries, frozen pineapple and grapes and a pound of frozen peaches. To that I will add 1/2 sugar and two yeast packets with warm water and give it a good 1 1/2 months to ferment. \n\nThere are a lot of potato wine recipes on line. Next I’ll experiment with dehydrated unseasoned potatoes flakes in addition to the fruit (as I might not have any sugar). \n\nThese fermentation recipes are a good way to use up fruit that are going bad and a little of yeast and sugar. I have heard that bread yeast makes a fine brew but have never tried. \n\nThese are good recipes for a homesteader or someone like me that believes home brew is a frugal and nutritious approach to alcohol consumption. You could make the argument that buying a gallon of vodka is cheaper but in my experience that vodka is simply addictive rot guy.",

I profusely thanked them and then they asked me how old my smoke detector was.  Well, I didn't know, but I figured it was probably over ten years old, so they said they'd replace it for me too! \n    A couple of hours later they pulled up to my house in a huge firetruck &amp; 3 firemen jumped out and fixed me right up!!!",
