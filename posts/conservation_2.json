It runs about 4 miles and has a gate that is closed from March to October (opens in time for deer season).  It's called the Chinquapin Turkey Hunting Walk-in Area.   \n\nI'd like to talk to someone about seeing if it's possible to keep the gate closed year-round.   It's a stunningly beautiful area but it's getting damaged by ATVs and those side-by-side buggies.  My favorite little campsite that I love so much and try to protect is getting its trees hacked down, littered, and rutted up by these folks.  \n\nThis area is right on the border of a wilderness area and while it might be too difficult to extend the wilderness area to protect it, I think it might be far easier to petition Forestry to just keep the gate closed and leave it a walk-in area year-round.   \n\nI'm just curious if anyone has any ideas on who to talk to and if this is even a possibility.    I can't emphasize enough how much I love this area and it's breaking my heart to see people destroying it.",
