Cue employee \"that one is locked too! you'll need to be less lazy and go further down the cart bay to get one\" \nexcuse me?\n\nI did not have the nerves for her and her yelling just aggravated my headache more, so I told her \"you know what?

I didn't want to wait a long time for food, so I ended up just stopping at a fast food place. \n\nWhen I was at the drive-thru getting food, the workers there spoke a total of 4 words to me: \"yeah (said twice)\", \"okay\", and \"here\". Here's pretty much the conversation:\n\n&gt;Fast food worker1: Yeah?\n\n&gt;Me: Um, hello? \n\n&gt;Fast food worker1: Yeah?\n\n&gt;Me: Ok, I'll have a *food order* and that's it.\n\n&gt;FFW1: Okay. \n\nI drive up to the first window to pay\n\n&gt;Me: Hi\n\n&gt;Fast food worker2: *Grunts, takes my card, swipes it, hands it back, waves me away. No eye contact.*\n\nI pull forward to the second window. 30 seconds later, fast food worker3 comes up with the bag. I reach my arm out to take it, he all but chunks it at me (he didn't hand it to me, I had to catch it) and says, \"Here\" and slams the window closed.\n\nI know you get what you pay for at these places so I shouldn't expect outstanding service or to be treated like a princess or anything, but I left feeling like I should've been treated a little better than this. If nothing else, they could've at least *handed* me my dinner instead of throwing it. \n\nI don't really go to fast food places all too often so maybe this isn't that weird of an experience. They did get my order right, were pretty fast, and I did manage to catch the food, so I guess that's all that really matters.",

I'm Dutch, and at that moment in time I was attending American kindergarten so I would learn to speak fluent English early on. Now Dutch is the uglier, smokes two packs of cigarettes a day cousin of German.\n\n\nIt's Easter time, and my eye falls on a plush pink bunny that is twice as big as I am. I don't want it, I NEED it. So I grab the horrendously huge stuffed animal and put it with our stuff. Nobody would notice, or so I reasoned. Cue my screaming and flailing around the store when while at the cash register, I'm told I'm not getting it. Yeah, I was a pretty horrible kid. My parents are telling me off, getting quite angry at me, when suddenly, a loose tooth comes out. I'm bleeding over the floor, now in an absolute panic because I can't find the tooth. Blood is being smeared everywhere. However, this exchange is happening in Dutch. To the cashier, it looked like my parents assaulted me, because all of a sudden there's blood, and a crazy kid is going even more berserk than before. Plus, it's a six year old who sounds like she could very well be possessed because Dutch. She called the store manager, before I screech that yeah, she better be calling back up because I lost a tooth and without it, the tooth fairy wouldn't come.\n\nI'm bleeding all over the place still, going Saw on this franchise with quite the audience. My entire family is on their knees trying to find the tooth. The cashier joins. When the manager comes, he also joins. A person working the floor also entered the hunt for my tooth. I even got some customers joining in, that's how big of a scene I'm making. It is not to be found. At this point I'm sobbing dejectedly face down at a different cash register and I've smeared my blood everywhere. An old lady is trying to console me, telling me the Tooth Fairy had a special detective fairy she called for these cases to ensure that all teeth are collected and their owners would receive due compensation. Onlookers are nodding yes.\n\nThe store manager presented me with the small version of the pink bunny I wanted. Anything I guess, to get me to stop crying, screaming, and bleeding in his store. It worked. I hugged him, got snot on his trousers, and we went on our merry way. I got that upset because I was afraid I now wasn't going to get money from the American tooth fairy. The American tooth fairy would leave me a dollar bill, and every kid knows paper money is superior to coins that the Dutch tooth fairy would have given me.\n\nI still have the bunny. Ever since, I try quite hard not to be a crazy customer.\n\n",

        "text": "Last month, I decided to buy a car. I've been saving up for it and I finally had enough to put down a solid down payment. My SO and I went to the dealership on a Wednesday. Together, we test drove all the cars I'd researched online and I chose the one I liked. Our car salesman was kinda corny and slimy, but that's to be expected. He was being respectful, and that's all I cared about. I told the salesman I wanted to sleep on it and that I'd be back the next day. \n\nI came back the next day with my mom and the car salesman's treatment of me did a complete 180. Suddenly, now that he is speaking to two women, I guess, he wouldn't answer my questions. He danced around all my concerns and he kept trying to get my to write the check and sign the paperwork ***before*** he told me what my interest rate was on the loan. I was completely fed up and decided I needed to weigh my options. I told him I forgot my checkbook and that I'd be back the next day. On my way out, I watched as another salesman openly turned to look at my butt as I walked passed. \n\nI hit up a few other dealerships the next morning and realized that despite the salesman's treatment of me, theirs was honestly the best deal. I ended up taking my dad with me, and the car salesman was back to the respectful attitude he had when I first set foot on the lot. His manager was a different story. He treated me like I'm was idiot, insisting on explaining incredibly simple concepts like power steering and wiper fluid over and over again. I bought my car, feeling dirty, and got the fuck out of there. \n\nSince then, I've been back to the dealership and on the phone constantly to fix their mistakes. If I don't, I won't be able to drive legally. The first time was because they forgot to do an emissions test. Then, my temporary tag expired and I needed a new one until my licence plate comes in. I called four days in a row before someone finally emailed me my temp. tags. While I was waiting on the phone, the guy on their end set the phone down and I overheard one of the salesmen say \"Yeah, she called yesterday. She's being a real bitch about it.\" Excuse the fuck out of me for not wanting a ticket. \n\nI am so fed up. I just want my plate so I can get on with my life. These assholes are the embodiment of every slimy salesman sterotype. \n\nDid I make mistakes? Yeah, absolutely. This is my first car buying experience  (I'm 22, and I've been driving a hand-me-down since I was 16) but these guys were some of the  least professional people I've ever met. /rant",

On my next visit, I think September, we were talking and shooting the shit because my doctor's pretty cool.  All of a sudden he asks me, \"I already know the answer, but go ahead and tell me anyways - do you smoke?\"  My husband and I laugh, and respond that I do not smoke.  (I suppose this is the point that I tell you I am on supplemental oxygen because my lungs and rib cage suck, so I cannot smoke (goodbye, hookah), I can't take anything that depresses breathing (not even AdvilPM or Benadryl), not can I take something like Midol.  Lungs apparently are fucking delicate)  So you can see why we think this is funny.  The doctor says, \"yeah, that's what I thought.  The reason I ask is because we got your test results from your urinalysis, and they were...interesting...\"  \"Let's define \"interesting, Doc\"  He pulls out the lab work from March, and holy shit.  Apparently \"my urine\" tested OFF THE CHARTS for THC, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and amphetamines (not crystal meth).  \n\nThe lab screwed up.  They gave me results for urine that's not mine.  Soon after this, I start getting bills from the lab company.  $1900, folks, for the urinalysis.  Not kidding.  I submit my insurance paperwork, not putting two and two together (I don't know how I didn't, but oh well).  That brought it down to $150 that I owe.  I called them this week, after receiving more bills, telling them politely that there was no way on God's green earth I was going to pay for their fuck-up.  I told them if I actually did any of those drugs, I'd pay, but since I don't, I won't pay.\n\nThe lady on the phone said she'd \"review the case\" and \"call me back in a couple days\".  We shall see how this plays out.\n\nTLDR: Medical lab does testing, gives wholly inaccurate results, bills me for them, and I tell them I won't be paying for it.  Case under review.",

You pick out the item you want on the showroom, note the shelf location, then pick up the boxed item in the warehouse area. I found what I was looking for, loaded up and checked out. When I went through the check out, the cashier scanned one, hit quantity 2, checked me out and I was on my way.\n\nWhen I got home, before I’d even opened the boxes, I noticed that I’d accidentally grabbed one white and one black chair instead of 2 black chairs. Crap. My fault, but should be easily corrected. I double check the receipt and note that they had charged me for 2 black chairs, so this should be an easy fix. So I go back and go to the customer service area.\n\nI explain to the cashier what happened, and show her the receipt. I can see the blank look of confusion cross her face. \n\nCashier: This is a white chair.\n\nMe: Yeah, I grabbed the wrong one, I just need to swap it for a black one. \n\nCashier: The problem is I can’t put this into the system to return it, because it isn’t what’s on the receipt.\n\nMe: You don’t need to put it into the system, just put this back and grab me a black chair.\n\nCashier:  But you’re returning this, I have to enter it as a return.  And the numbers don’t match. The cashier who rang you up should have done them separately.\n\nMe: Probably so, but you don’t need to enter it as a return, or enter it at all. Your system thinks I have two black chairs. If you put this white one back on the shelf and give me a black one, I'll have two black chairs. Your system will be happy, I’ll be happy, and your inventory will be right. No need to enter anything. \n\nCashier: I need to get my manager. \n\nManager is found, and the exact same exchange ensues. Followed by the need to bring in yet another manager, who also fails to understand the logic of just sending me out the door with what my receipt already shows I have. In the end, they finally ended up with some convoluted process that involved ringing up the white chair, then returning it, then putting in back on the shelf and getting me the black chair. \n\n",

Expected delivery is within 2-3 days.\n\n- After 2 days, the shipment is \"on hold\", and still in the US.\n\n- I call the the international courier hotline in Switzerland, and ask them if there is anything I can do to make them release the parcel. They tell me that the package is on hold because they need more information from the sender\n\n- So I call the sender (electronics supplier), and they tell me that this seems very unlikely, but they will investigate further\n\n- The electronics supplier emails, telling me that all US pilots from that particular courier express are on strike, and this is why the package is \"on hold\". (So apparently, the international courier hotline customer service was unaware of that, and I only found out through the sender)\n\n- Fast forward a few days, I look at the tracking number by chance and it says \"The recipient has rejected the delivery (20 minutes ago)\". Which is weird, because I was at the office all day, and there was certainly no package being delivered.\n\n- I call the courier express hotline to inquire about the situation. Apparently, the driver did not find our address, which again is weird, because it's easily found on all maps and/or navigation softwares. I leave them my cell phone number and they will try to deliver again.\n\n- I get a call from somebody with a package. I tell them to meet me outside at the next Subway. That's how I hot my parcel in the end.\n\nBonus: they also did not find my home address for another shipment",

On mobile\n\nTldr: car repair place were supposed to fix my car, but they drove it into someone else's car instead.\n\nA tyre blew on my beautiful little Mini Cooper cabriolet yesterday.  Despite the fact that it is now 12 years old, I keep this car in perfect condition and I absolutely adore it.  It has never been in any collision and its bodywork is pristine.  \n\nI took it to the car repair place nearest to my house, where it has been many times before for its annual check, so that they could pop a new tyre on.  I left the car there for a couple of hours so they could fix it whilst I got on with doing my normal stuff.\n\nI rang two hours later to ask if it was ready to collect and they told me it was.  I went back to collect it and pay for the tyre.  As I was getting out my bank card to pay, the owner said: \"we need to tell you something pretty bad about your car,\"\n\nMy heart sank and lots of different scenarios played through my head - was it in really bad condition? Was it unsafe for me to use? Would I have have to part with it and buy a new one?\n\nThe guy then explained slowly and at length, (which I actually found irritating - just get to the point!) how he was moving my car, was reversing it and heard the reverse parking sensors beeping, but ignored the beeping.  He reversed it right into another car on his forecourt.  He took me to show me the damage.   There is a massive set of scratches and scuffs on the back of my car.\n\nTo his credit, he apologised and has arranged for it to be fixed.  He is obviously going to pay for the repair.  I expect he will have had the same conversation with the owner of the other vehicle.  He says he was absolutely mortified when it happened - I would have been too.\n\nAt least it's only superficial damage.  I thought the guy handled it well in the circumstances, so I was careful to not be angry with him or act like an asshole.  He clearly was having a shitty day. ",

        "text": "LTL;FTP; be gentle with formatting :)\n\nI live in a rural area so it's not uncommon that we have a very large garden. To make things easier we (my family+ grandparents) have an riding mower, which serves us like 10+ years well. \n\nWhile my family have a plane garden, my grandparents in the same village have a some sort of hilly garden. Even driving between the \"garage\" here and their garden is like 7 minutes, in which like half of the time the gradient is like pretty high (maybe like 20°).\n\nSo last year it was about time to change the brake pads. It was some sort of important to me, mainly because my little cousins (5-7 years) are often on the mower with me in the not so plane garden of my grandparents. The second reason is when i'm driving home i often put \"Neutral\" on the top of the \"hill\", lower the motor rpm (so its more quiet und less fuel consuming) and let it roll, only using the big \"handbrake\" to slow down.\n\nSo on and beyond last year we did load or riding mower on our little trailer and drive to the nearest riding mower service ($RMS) around half an hour away.\n\n**Dramatis personae:**\n\n\n$RMSguy1: The first guy of the riding mower service, writing the order offer\n\n$RMSguy2: The second guy of the riding mower service, writing the order offer (could be $RMSguy1, doesn't really matter)\n\n$Dad: My dad\n\n$ME: Well me :-) \n\n_\n\n\n$ME: \n\n&gt;We would like to have our brake pads changed cause our village is very hilly and it is about time.\n\nI really stressed it to be *changed* because last time they adjusted the brake pads only and in the new mowing season the brakes were as bad as before after five times driving between gardens.\n&gt;And the belt needs to be changed too, because we got sometimes hiccups at our hilly garden.\n\n\n$Dad: \n\n&gt;And since the mower is already here you can do mower service aswell.\n\n$RMSguy1:\n\n&gt;Alright, we will do this. We going to give you notice when the mower is ready to picked up.\n\nThey gave us notice like 2-3 (idk exactly) weeks later, the mower is ready to be picked up.\nBecause i got no time (i needed to work) my dad did pick up the mower.\n\nSo guess what some trainee at $RMS did: Mower service (cleaning, changing oil and stuff), belt changing and ...yeah adjusting brake pads \"cause the pads were good enough\". *sigh*\n\nWell i guess i need to drive very carefully another season, no \"Neutral\"-downhill driving. The brakes were as bad as before after two times driving between gardens.\n\nNotice: In \"Driving\" and \"Backwards\" the \"slowing down\", after lifting the foot of the gas pedal, works however nearly fine (guess that got something to do with \"enginge brake\", on lower rpm it slows down pretty hard).\n\nWell so this year, more exactly last month:\n$ME to $Dad: \n\n&gt;We need new brake pads and on one side of the mow casing a little roll needed to be welded, because it got loose. And maybe we can get a new ejection channel since it did bend a lot.\n\n\nAnd again we load or riding mower on our little trailer and drive to $RMS at Saturday morning.\n\n$ME: \n\n&gt;We really need the brake pads exchanged, because that was what we wanted last year, your trainee adjusted it only and the brakes were after two times mowing as bad as before. So please exchange them.\n\n$RMSguy2: \n\n&gt;ok\n\n$ME: \n\n&gt;Also one roll of the mow casing needs to be welded. \n\n&gt;and could you please look up the price of a new ejection channel.\n\nMy dad standing around 1m next to me, has heard the conversation.\n$Dad: \n\n&gt;What costs a new riding mower? (since ours is maybe too old to get new things and sometimes have starting problems)\n\n$RMSguy2: \n\n&gt;around xxxx $. \n\nlooking the price for the channel up \n&gt;The price for the channel is YY $.\n&gt;you could also do mower service and we can check engine and stuff.\n\n$Dad (in consent with me):\n\n&gt;Ok please get us a new ejection channel and look if you can find some problems with the engine.\n\nWhile unloading the mower, the order offer was printed and i check \"Exchange brake pads\" is on the list. $Dad signs it.\n\n$RMSguy2: \n\n&gt;The mower should be ready to be picked up on Friday. We will give you notice.\n\nAfter two weeks of waiting (we nearly forgot the mower is not in his winter quarters) my dad phones $RMS on last Friday.\n\n\"Its not ready because we are missing some special screws. We will call you when mower is ready...\"\n\n\nOn Tuesday we got the message on our answering machine the mower is ready.\n\nToday (Friday, nearly 3 weeks after the order) my dad picks up the mower. I was working at near city.\nSo guess what $RMS done: Welded the roll, added new ejection channel, sharpened the knives, exchanged the battery and...\n\n\n**ADJUSTED the brake pads**\n\n\nTL:DR Sometimes service guys thinking too much, doesn't improve the result\n\n* I'm a little bit mad at my dad, because the main reason we did go to $RMS this year was to get new brake pads. Since i forgot to remind him on the phone and today, i'm a little bit mad at me, too...\n\n\n* Some BONUS rant material: I strongly believe they exchanged the battery to make some $. The old one was only 4 years old and we did remove the battery every winter, loading it with an appropriate battery charger 2-3 times in that time.\n\n\n* Feel free to ask questions if something is not clear, english is only my second language\n\n\nedit: spelling and formatting and later TL:DR",

That operator revealed to me that their **billing system randomly selects a disconnect date** between 8 and 30 days after the past due date.\n\nAt least that was something.  Although I don't fully buy it, because what's the chance I would get 30 days every time (for various stretches over a 5 year period), then suddenly 25% less twice in a row?  No, there's a policy change hidden here.\n\nMe, the customer, learned that I can have no expectation regarding service interruption scheduling.  All so the company can surprise me and extract extra reconnection fees.\n\nThis isn't customer service, it's customer abuse, even if I am riding a fine line.  It's bad enough that I've spent that past 5.5 years paying for 4G that was never available to me, and never will be.",

L1 and L2 which were already included in $80/mo, L3 was $20/mo extra. \n\nI called and asked if I'm eligible for 2 free lines (total 5). The representative said yes. I only needed one line (it was pending I buy one anyways), but I also wanted to turn my 3rd line into a free line. \n\nThe representative was very kind in telling me I couldn't do that, BUT another workaround would be to open L4 and L5. Port L3's number to L5 and cancel L3. Sounds great! \n\nToday, L4 and L5 sim cards arrived. I called up the carrier. The representative who assisted me had a very thick accent, but it was okay. Now, I grew up in Ontario and California, so I don't have much of an accent. But she had much difficulty in assisting me. After she was telling me I couldn't cancel any lines (at all), I asked to be escalated. \n\nThe supervisor was where even more trouble came in. I had been calm and consistent this entire time, but she came in high volume.\n\nImmediately: \"Sir you cannot do that\". Not much way to introduce myself. She continued saying that if I continue to do what I'm doing, she will take my discount away. \n\nI said, the promotion calls for two lines paid, 2 lines free. I just wanted to do just that. Convert my paid line into a free one by means of the promo. \n\nShe didn't seem to understand what I wanted, but I didn't care at this point.

        "text": "So I preordered a 128GB Pixel XL back on October 12th of this year. The order was successful and this very large US-only cellular network and phone provider gave me a delivery date of October 20th.\n\nOctober 20th rolled around and what I received in the mail was a crushed piece of metal and glass that wouldn't power on. In disbelief I contacted their support team and they told me I couldn't print off a return label at my home and that I would have to go to their nearest brick and mortar store and have them print it off for me. I followed their instructions and returned the phone. I then got in contact with their support again and I was told they were out of the phone and that they would order me a new one at no additional cost. I was told that would be shipped by November 18th.\n\nNovember 18th comes around and I receive no shipping notification. So I contact their support chat on their website, again. I had a lengthy conversation with a very nice-seeming person who spoke with her boss and someone from this company's shipping department. They got back to me and *guaranteed* that they just put my phone in a box and that it was still shipping out on November 18th and that I shouldn't worry. I got out of the chat window happy and expecting an email soon with the shipping notification... That would never come.\n\nI contacted chat again today (November 21) where a new, less-nice support rep informed me that the people I spoke with on the 18th were lying to me to get me to shut up and that my new expected ship date is December 26th, a full 2 months and 6 days after I was supposed to get the phone that I ordered. I was upset, but I didn't want to take it out on the rep I was speaking to because it was not his fault. I then asked for his supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor calls me on my phone and tells me that I am out of luck until December 26th **at the earliest** and that I shouldn't expect the phone by that date either.\n\nSo now, due to absolutely no fault of my own (except that I decided to renew a contract with a company as bad as [insert one of the largest cellular service provider's in the US name here]), I am stuck with a 3+ year old phone for the indefinite future.\n\nAnd that company can do this too because they already have my money and they have me stuck in a 2 year contract. So they'll go out and sell hundreds of thousands of these phones on Black Friday and I'll be waiting with my thumb up my ass until next year some time.",

        "text": "Where to begin. I recently moved and tried to get cable installed at the new address. It did not start off well. I was willing to pay the $50 to have someone come out and professionally install the service to hopefully save on any future headaches. Boy was I wrong. The house had two lines coming to it externally, both were cut at the hook holding them to the house on the second floor. One was clearly coaxial cable. \n\nThe first installer showed up with no drill and had to leave for 40 minutes to go borrow one. When he came back he looked at the two lines and said “those are both AT&amp;T so we will need to schedule a bucket truck to run a new line. Those only come out during business hours.” I asked if he would mind testing to coaxial cable to see if it is [internet provider] since [internet provider] is the only cable provider in the area. He assured me it was AT&amp;T. \n\nI knew this was not the case, so I went and bought a ladder and my own roll of coaxial cable, ends, and a crimper. I hooked it up, and hooked up my modem. Not only was it an [internet provider] line, but it was still active. I ran the line through the door for the time being and set up call number two to have the service installed properly. The tech comes out and installs the service. It is working fine. \n\nAfter a while, the service starts going out. It is usually only for a few hours at a time but sometimes for a few days. I call and after significant attempts to troubleshoot they determine I need a tech to come out again. The tech comes out and because it was working at the time determines everything is ok. The service begins going out again. The woman on the customer service line assures me it is my modem and that I need a new one. I went and picked one up at Best Buy for $80. I hook it up and call the 800 number to register it. We get it up and running but the next day it is down again. I call the 800 number again. The woman who answers says it looks as if someone started setting up the new modem but stopped halfway through. She supposedly finishes the process and we get the service up and running. The next day, it is down again. I call the 800 number and they cant even connect to the modem because of the weak signal. They determine I need another tech. \n\nHe comes out while the signal is good. He notices the old modem is still set up as primary and calls to have the new modem made primary. Tests the signal and determines it is ok. A day or two later it goes down again for over one day. When I call, the signal is too weak to even connect to the modem to reset it from their end. They determine I need a tech. This is appointment number 5. My time window is between 5-7pm. I am heading home on the train and get a call around 4:30 pm saying “sorry we missed you” and offering to reschedule. The woman on the phone confirmed the time frame was 5-7 and the tech broke company policy by closing out the ticket before the time frame even started. When the woman at the 800 number reached out to local dispatch to see if the tech was still out she was informed he checked out for the day and they didn’t have anyone. This entire conversation is before 5 pm when the window started. I was supposed to be leaving that night (Friday) and coming back Sunday night to have thanksgiving with my family. I decided to leave Saturday morning to finally get [internet provider] taken care of. The tech missing the appointment meant I could not leave Friday\n\nThe woman on the phone was very helpful and took the time to email local dispatch with me on the phone explaining the problems I have been having. They assure her they will have a lead technician go out for the following appointment. She sets an appointment for 5-7 pm on Sunday. At this point I missed driving down to thanksgiving Friday because of [internet provider], now I am leaving early, because of [internet provider]. It is roughly a 4 hour drive. While driving home, around 3 pm, I get a call from the tech asking if he can come immediately. I told him nobody is there but there will be somebody by 5. He says I am the last call and there “might not be anyone around by then”. I get home at quarter to 5 and nobody is out front (I assumed they might be waiting since I was the last call). I call to get an estimate and the automated system says someone will be there between 6-630. Just after 6 I get an automated call that the tech is out front. I look out front, and even go outside, and there was nobody. He wasn’t parked in the wrong spot because I looked down the street and even went around the corner. There is nobody around. He either drove by to check in and close out the ticket or didn’t even bother to do that. After several reset attempts I get the internet working for the time being. \n\nSo now I have appointment number 7 set up for Tuesday. Seven appointments to get a working internet connection. And for obvious reasons I am not confident it will be fixed on that appointment either. AT&amp;T offers fiber to the premises where I live but I would have to take a day off of work for it to be installed. After I add up all the time I have taken off for 7 Comcast appointments I could have easily had it installed. \n\nTuesday is the big day, lets hope this tech at least knows that a coaxial cable does not belong to AT&amp;T.\n",

My father died a couple years ago while I was at his bedside, so I understand how this is an emotional time for her.\n\nSince this particular store has candies by the register, I asked if it would make her day a little better if I bought her a candy bar.  I'd already picked one up for myself, it was $2, and she was a sweet girl.  She was shocked, grinned, and said yes.\n\nPlease think of this story NOT as me patting myself on the back, but as a reminder that YOU can make someone's day for $2.  Retail is hard enough, especially this time of year, so if you can brighten someone's day for a small amount of money, please do it!",

        "text": "I try to be as kind as possible to retail workers, well, anyone but especially people who frequently probably deal with bad tempered people (Admittedly like myself at times.) \n\nSo the other day I met my friend at the mall for lunch. I was feeling a little grumpy for whatever reason which is something I'm kind of used to but I'm usually pretty good about stuffing it away. After we ate I wanted to go by \"heat subject\" to look at some stuff before I had to leave to pick up my sibling from work. \n\nWe went into the store and walked around. I found this hat I really liked but it was too high up so I went over to the desk to get the guy with the hook. \n\nThere was a woman at the desk and he was helping her so I patiently waited, and waited, and waited some more. \n\nWhen I went in there I had like 30 minutes until I had to leave, I waited 20 minutes behind one woman. I was feeling a little aggravated. I don't know if she was making a return or what. He would print out a receipt, do a bunch of stuff, print out another receipt. I think, to be honest, I was more angry at her than him but he just happened to be in my line of fire, Also why the hell is he the only one working? There's almost always two people in here at this time of day. \n\nFinally, the woman walked away. \n\nThe guy was like \"Can I help you?\" \n\nI think that made me angry because there was no, 'sorry for your wait' like, he knew I had been there forever. \n\n\"Yeah, there's a hat on the wall over there that I want and I can't reach it.\" \n\nHe grabbed the hook thing and headed over to get it. \n\nNow at this point I'm really really frustrated. I'm already in a bad mood and I just wasted all this time standing behind ONE person, not even to get an apology. I was boiling over. I made a comment something like, \"Yeah, I just wanted to get the hat I need to be out of here like 10 minutes ago.\" \n\nwhen that popped out of my mouth it was like turning on a faucet, more words just kept pouring out. \n\nHe said something like, \"Well I'm the only one working right now so..\"\n\nI spouted off \"Well it shouldn't have taken so long. Not everybody has time to stand around and wait.\" \n\nMy friend at this point realized I was losing it (she knows how I can get.) \n\nHe responded with \"Well, there's nothing I can do about it.\" \n\nNow thinking back to it I know that there was nothing he could do about it and I really wasn't late at all but I have my own issues (Anxiety mostly) and I immediately spun around and gave my friend a look. \n\nShe told me to calm down and I ranted off across the store (mostly mumbling to myself.) I got back to her and apologized for being such a psycho-bitch. She bought the hat for me and let me leave. \n\nI was just so furious, and it wasn't even at him. I felt so bad about reacting the way I did. The guilt was eating me away so I found this subreddit and let it all out here. \n\nDear \"Heat Subject\" guy,\n\nI'm truly sorry for making you deal with my pscho-self.\n\nsincerely,\n\nThat crazy hat lady.",

        "text": "A brown package delivery company sometimes has trouble finding our house. This is actually understandable since there is a street and house number exactly the same in the next town over… but the town and zip code are different, as is the name of the resident. Moreover, we have been receiving packages in this house for 25 years, plus Google Maps and Garmin GPS both find us fine.\n\nIf we have our regular driver, no problem. But if we have another driver, they will use the Brown mapping system that says we do not exist. \n\nThe most recent snafu is typical. Phone conversation follows:\n\n“We received an email that tells us package ### can’t be delivered because of an incorrect address, and lists the correct address. This has been a problem in the past, and I’m pretty sure your system is confused again. The address is correct. I can give directions, and supply a phone number for the driver to use if you want.”\n\n“I see here the address is incorrect. What is the corrected address?”\n\n“It’s the same as on the package, (address). The address is correct.”\n\n “But, as I just told you, that address is not correct.”\n\n“That is the correct address. I live here. I have lived in this house for 25 years, and I do know that the address is correct.”\n\n“Our system says that street is in a different city, with a different zip code. But it also says it’s an apartment, and there is no apartment number supplied. This address is unusable.”\n\n“It’s usable if you realize that the address is correct, including town and zip. If you look in the wrong city and wrong zip code you will find that there is a street of the same name. That is a different address. It doesn’t mean *our* address is wrong. It means that two cities have a street of the same name. Look in Google Maps, or use a GPS, or use the phone number on the package to get directions.”\n\n“We use our own mapping system which is much more detailed. It says this address is not valid.”\n\n“Then your mapping system contains an error. It’s had this error for several years. Our regular driver knows about this error and delivers to us three or four times a week. When our driver has a day off, they leave a note for the replacement driver, but some of these evidently can’t read and return the package to the warehouse when they discover the apartment building in the next town is not our house. Your system then emails us to tell us the address is incorrect, and we should contact you to correct the address. I will then try, as I am doing now, to convince you to deliver to the supplied address, which is indeed correct. I will offer to give directions, which you will transcribe into the notes, along with the phone number to call for more directions if required.  This will fail, as it has dozens of times over the last couple of years. Tomorrow I will call back after the package is again returned to the warehouse after one more round trip to the wrong town because the warehouse staff and driver KNOW the address is wrong. I will suggest that I drive to the warehouse and pick up the package in person. You will say this is discouraged because this warehouse does not have customer facing facilities, but you will make an exception. You will promise to submit a ticket to get the problem corrected, but nothing will ever come of this. Then in about a week, I will get a couple of postcards in the mail informing me that this package (which I picked up) cannot be delivered because the address, the same address to which the postcard was mailed and which postcard was delivered properly, is not a usable address. You will note that I recited this quickly. It’s because I have the entire thing written on a sticky note because I have to repeat it once or twice a month. How about we save some time, and I just pick up the package today?”\n\n“If you would supply a corrected address and we will re-attempt delivery. This warehouse does not have customer pick-up facilities.”\n",

        "text": "I originally thought it was just an oversight but I'm now I'm not sure.\n\nI order lunch from the same place often. Not every day, but usually once a week. They have good food. I place the order online through their website. They have a minimum price for delivery orders so I usually add water bottles to get the correct amount. The water bottles are pretty expensive at $1.25 per bottle, but I don't want any more food. My favorite sandwich costs well under the minimum price a delivery order must be so I usually have to add two water bottles to each order.\n\nAt the end of last month, I placed my usual lunch order and had to add the two water bottles to reach the minimum. When the driver arrived, he only gave me one water bottle. I didn't say anything since one water bottle isn't going to break me and I accepted the order.\n\nI ordered again earlier this month. Same order, two water bottles. The driver only gave me one. I brushed it off again since it's only about $2.50 now and I'm lucky to have a decent income. I took my order and scuttled off.\n\nLast week, I placed my usual order again, plus two water bottles. The driver came with one. I'm a little concerned at this point so this time, I asked him where my other water bottle was. He pointed at the handwritten carbon copy of my order that was stapled to the bag with my lunch in it and said that only one water bottle was put down. I would have to call the store to get it corrected. I could barely see what the receipt said but I know I added two water bottles since my order wouldn't have been eligible for delivery without them and I could see my order history on their website I order from.\n\nSo, I called the store. I was told that I had, indeed, ordered two water bottles and that they would send the missing one out to me shortly. Before I could say that I just wanted a credit, I was disconnected. Oh well. Another driver brought me the water.\n\nCut to yesterday. I ordered my usual plus two water bottles. Again. And the driver only brought me one. Again. I asked the driver where my second water was and after looking at the receipt, he told me my order only included one water bottle. So, I called the store and was assured my second water bottle would be delivered to me and it was.\n\nBut, this has happened four times in a little less than a month. I understand that mistakes happen and it's unusual for a customer to order two beverages. It just doesn't make sense to me since without the second water bottle, my order wouldn't meet the minimum cost for delivery so it should be obvious that something is missing. \n\nI really like the food at this place, but I don't know what to do about this forgotten water bottle business.

        "text": "So years and years ago, a well known UK catalogue store decided to go online at last. As I had been going to the stores for ages, and had a number of their catalogues at home, it seemed a no brainer, just type the number I would normally write onto a piece of paper in store, into the web, and wait for my delivery. No awful people interactions needed. \n\nSo, logged onto their site and tried to register for an account. Part of it was it wanted a UK phone number for something, I forget what. I enter my number in international format... +44 xxx xxx xxxx and its rejected. Fine, UK site, try again in local format (0xxx) xxx xxxx. And its rejected. Try again with out the brackets,  0xxx xxx xxxx. And its rejected. OH what the...! Try again as just a blob.... 0XXXXXXXXXX and it works. But I am pissed off now. Every number I entered should have worked, and that one long number blob is horrible. I cancel the registration, find the contact webmaster link, and email them with this story. Days later the reply comes... \"Sorry, we can't change it as all the developers have moved on, please register with the phone number as one long number.\" It has to be 10 years now, and I have not ever bought anything from them online, and now very rarely go in store to get the latest catalogue.\n\nThe second site is a well known US/UK weekly 4 snack in a box company from which I get the variety box for my mid morning snack. Last week I was trying to rate my last few boxes online but from the orders page, when I clicked love,like,bin, or try it would take me to the individual product page to rate, and then not take me back to the list of orders. Clicking back took me back to orders, but my place was lost. Irritating. Didn't want go though all this just to rate some boxes so emailed them with their online form. Explained the problem. An email reply came the next day... \"Sorry about this, that sounds like a bug so I have passed it on to the developers, in the mean time, here are the direct links to the boxes you wanted to rate where it does work correctly.\"  Logged on today, and the problem has been fixed. Which is what reminded me of the first site's awful service.\n\ntl;dr One site tells me to get lost, loses customer, one site does it right, weekly snack box order stays. ",

        "text": "I just discovered this subreddit as I'm new to Reddit so I hope I won't be the weird guy at the party.\n\nI used to go to this grocery store on the floor below my work to get my lunch and one day I get to the register of this very lazy, Asian girl who always seems to have a frown on her face. I have literally never seen her smiling nor heard her say Hi.\n\nI've been going to this store for 2 years and she usually does things very slowly. Like snail-pace slow.\n\nWhen I get to the register there are two women, in their late forties, dressed somewhat trashy/dirty. They both reek of alcohol and I can hear them mumbling to each other that their taxi is waiting outside. My country is ridiculously expensive and you pay an average hour of work worth of money in like 4-5 minutes (about $10), while waiting. \n\nI'm just minding my own not really paying attention to them until the sad, lazy Asian girl starts scanning in their 2 cups of ramen noodles and fetching a pack of cigarettes for them... literally slow mo-ing around like some kind of ameba. The two semi-drunk women become very agitated when they realize Ms. Slow-Asia does not give af about their time-crisis. They start telling her to \"get the fuck going you Asian twat\" and \"Don't you understand Icelandic you shit?\"(that's what we speak most of the time here in Iceland).\n\nAt this point, I became aware of my inner-everyday-superhero! At first, I was pretty thrown back about the insults, even though I understood that time was of the essence to get back to sucking a vodka bottle at the back of an expensive cab. But then I got just absolutely mad. I'm a pretty big and wide son of a gun and basically raised my voice to about 2 points from shouting: \"What the fuck are you saying to that poor girl. I really can't believe a grown up person would talk like that to a complete stranger. Don't you have any decency... etc\".\n\nAs I thundered on for about 15 seconds the whole store just stood dumbfounded and dead silence. Almost like Ms. Slowpoke had turned us all into slaves of time...\n\nWhen the two ladies realized what had happened and finally figured they had to answer for their inappropriate attitude they started saying they were really sorry and didn't know why they acted that way and they were in a hurry and all that... to me.\n\nWhen they finished I said: \"Yeah sounds good, now say it again to Ms. Sad Asia here (of course I didn't say that, but you know that...)\n\nWhen they had left and the Asian girl started scanning my products she gave me the smallest smile I've seen. It was probably the closest she has ever been to saying thank you, to anyone...\n\nA few days later the store manager greeted me and thanked me for standing up for her employee.\n\nPs. I haven't seen her smile since this happened.\n\nTL;DR - I schooled some alcoholic middle aged women in mannerism at the register in a convenience store.",

So i tried to reset my tv, mess around, nothing.  I called a couple of tv repairs and they tell me to call the brand. I jump online, go to customer support and start chatting with them, tell them the problems and then they get me to do the same tv reset and shit. Nothing works and then the guys says to give him a minute.\n\n5 minutes later he asks me for my details, name address, tv serial number. I give it to him. We are on chat so it's going pretty slow. Then he says: ok we will send someone to fix it for you. I tell him i cant afford big repairs then he says: its ok, we will handle it for you. \n\nThat was yesterday noon. Today at 10.00, someone came in, changed the wireless lan adapter, then he goes away. Free of charge. Within less than 24 hours, 4 years later the company fixed my tv for free. I feel so happy.",

        "text": "This happened last night and I warn you now it is going to be long story. My partner and kids headed out to get some fast food for dinner because we were feeling lazy. The kids wanted to go to one place and my husband and I wanted to go to another. We grab the kids' food first and then head over to where we wanted to go. We head inside and immediately I know we are in for a long wait. There are customers waiting around everywhere that are obviously frustrated and all the staff are running around like headless chickens. The drive thru timer is showing that the current car has been waiting 10 minutes. My partner and I consult and go back outside and notice that the place we just got the kids food at is now packed as well and not likely to be any better. I send the kids to the tables to go eat their food before it gets cold and I place my order and get ready to for the wait. \n\n5 minutes passes. The guy waiting beside me is all dressed in black and looks like he works at one restaurants nearby. He is playing with his phone and trying not to show how frustrated he is. We have a quick chat while we wait and I find out that he does work at a restaurant nearby, he has already been waiting for 10 minutes and is probably going to be late for work. \n\n10 minutes passes and the woman on my other side is clucking indignantly and keeps getting text messages. Of course because I am a social bastard we have a quick chat and I find out she has hungry teenagers at home that are blowing up her phone trying to find out when she will be getting home with their food. There is an elderly couple who give up and go sit down to wait for the food. By this time my kids have finished their food so I send them to go play in the playground. I start browsing reddit while I wait. Everybody is staying calm despite being hungry and a little frustrated. \n\nAt 15 minutes of waiting, I see through the glass doors that a cab pulls up. A guy hops out and swaggers into the store. He just looks like trouble. The cab remains waiting for him in the carpark. As he gets to the counter I warn him that we have all been waiting for at least 15 minutes and that he may not want to leave the cab waiting for him because I know the meter will be running. He brushes it off and places his order. I sign internally and go back to my phone\n\nAnother 10 minutes passes and the guy who was now certainly late for work has got his food and ran out the door and so has the woman with the hungry teenagers. The guy from the cab begins getting aggravated and attempts ranting to me about how he has a cab waiting and this is going to cost him a fortune. Wow this is horrible... if only someone had tried to warn him that this would happen. He goes up to the counter and tries to convince them that he needs his food now and gets nowhere with them. He struts back to waiting beside me and starts trying to rant to me again. I tell him that he can either go somewhere else or send the cab off and the fast food place will be happy to order another cab when he was done (I should explain I used to work at this store about 7 years ago and I know the customer orientated policies) or he can continue waiting. I notice that it looks like the staff are now starting to assemble my order so I perk up because I am starving. \n\nCab dude is now very worked up and starts again ranting to me yet again (I must have a sympathetic looking face) he should just jump the counter and what he planned to do after he jumped the counter, I am not sure. I don't remember because by this point I was enraged and starving. I warned him the wait would happen, he has already tried to get his food ahead of me because he is just that important and when finally they are getting my order, this dip shit wants to jump the counter and fuck them up. I lose it and tell him that I warned him this would happen and that if he jumps the counter then all of us will be waiting even longer as we wait for the Police to come get his dumb ass. Cab dude is surprised that I lost it (and so am I frankly, I am a quiet meek type but he has really pissed me off) but regains his cockiness quickly and says that he won't be here when the Police come. I laugh and point out that he paid by bank card, there are security cameras everywhere and that I have noted the cab number down. His cockiness vanishes again quickly and he shuts up. The woman finally calls out my order and I grab my food after 29 minutes of waiting and hustle my family out the door. \n\nTL;DR: guy thinks he's above the law after having to wait for food after being told that the wait would be long. Op tells them that that the guy would be caught easily if he did so.\n\nEdited to fix words and add suggested tl;dr\n",

The assistant manager came up and said, \"Oh, thanks\" then proceeded to turn and walk away.

        "text": "Setting is a coastal florida town in the middle of nowhere. I take a break from remodeling our house and go to [dollar store] for some essentials. Like they say, you can go to the dollar store no matter how grubby you are, and I've been doing under-the-house plumbing work in the FL heat - I'm pretty grubby.\n\nAs I got there I saw a couple of tourist kids looking over the stuff in the bins on the outside of the store – swim fins, little nets for catching crabs, Styrofoam boogey boards, etc. That’s how I knew they were tourists, I guess.\n\nI see behind them, sneaking by the edge of the parking lot (about 30 feet farther away than the corner of the store) headed towards the dumpster was a small (50 pounds?) young bear. He was glancing our way, clearly a bit nervous about the people, which is good. I stopped to watch before going in.\n\nAs he got out of sight around the edge of the store the wet bear smell hit us. It was drizzling, so he was pretty damp, was close, and thus smelled pretty strong. The two boys (about 8 and 10) looked up, and looked around trying to identify the smell… if you’ve ever smelled a damp ferret, it’s close.\n\nI said “That’s what a bear smells like.”\n\nOlder boy said “Really? A bear? Where?”\n\nI asked “Which way is the wind blowing from?”\n\nThey both looked in the correct direction. Older boy asks “How far away do you think?”\n\nI said “He’s just around the corner of the store, over near the fence. Don’t worry, he’s only about as big as a large dog. A baby.”\n\nRight about then their parents came out of the store \"MOM! DAD! This guy says a bear is coming from that direction (points) just from sniffing the air! He can even tell it’s a baby from how it smells!”\n\nMom and Dad look suspiciously at the filthy, scruffy guy who is talking to their two young boys. I suddenly realize this looks potentially bad, and wonder what to say to make them realize I'm not really a dirty old man. Well, I *am* dirty, and not a spring chicken, but not THAT kind of dirty old man!\n\nWhile I'm thinking, Mom comes to a decision, her face hardens, and she opens her mouth and takes a deep breath to say something to me that evidently was going to require a lot of air. \n\nRight on cue the bear comes back out from behind the store, sees us all looking at it, and runs away across the street. Kids go wild. Dad's mouth drops open as well. Mom's mouth closes. Opens and closes a couple of times with no sound emerging. \n\nI looked at mom, dad, and the awestruck kids and was torn between explaining, or taking one last sniff and telling them he had been eating acorns and palmetto hearts, or maybe that they ought to head inside because (sniff) mom was nearby and she smelled irritable. In the end I decided to just nod the nod of the wise old woodsman and go in the store.",

So, at $60 per ton tipping fee I owe $252.\n------------------\nThe county government here runs a trash collection center (AKA “the dump”). You drive over a scale on the way in and out. Charge is by weight: $60 a ton with a minimum charge of $7.50. \n\nI had removed a couple of full length mirrors and had a cardboard box containing about 30 pounds of razor-sharp glass shards. I thought of the many ways this could go wrong left out for the trash truck, and elected to take to the collection center. \n\nI drove on to the scale, got waved through, tossed the box into the dumpsters (not allowed to put mirrored glass in the recycle bin) and drove back to the scale.\n\nTrashGuy is TG. Cop and Me play ourselves.\n\nTG: “That will be $252.00 sir.”\n\nMe: “Um, I’m pretty sure you have me confused with someone else.  I should owe $7.50”\n\nTG checks his notes. “No, you owe $252 for 8,400 pounds.”\n\nMe: “That’s not possible. It was one cardboard box that I lifted myself”\n\nTG: “Sir, I have a photo of your car on the scale, with a time and weight. I have another photo of you on the scale now, with time and weight. The scale doesn’t lie.”\n\nMe: “Evidently it’s possible for it to make a mistake, though.”\n\nTG: “No, you weighed 12,300 pounds going in and 3,900 pounds going out. You’re gonna have to pay, or if you don’t have enough cash or check on you then we can have you sign the slip that you owe it and we bill you for the amount plus $35. If you don’t pay then we issue a summons for your arrest.”\n\nMe: “Surely you can just look at the weight and see there is a mistake. Is there a supervisor here? Can I see the photo?”\n\n“No supervisor. If you don’t pay and won’t sign, then I’m supposed to print out the photos as evidence and call the cops. As soon as I print it to show you, you owe the extra $35 just like we mailed it to you. If you leave without paying they arrest you.”\n\nTG: “I’m not paying $252.”\n\nCop is called, and thankfully shows up in about five minutes.\n\nTG: “He won’t pay the $252 dumping fee.”\n\nCop: “Why won’t you pay?”\n\nMe: “He says I owe for four tons of trash. I dumped one cardboard box, maybe 30 to 40 pounds. There is no way my car coming in weighed over 12,000 pounds.”\n\nCop: “What kind of truck are you driving?”\n\nMe: “No truck. A Kia. That one.” (point)\n\nCop: “OK, I agree there is no way that thing ever weighed 12,000 pounds. The scales were wrong.” (TG prints out my photos, and we all look at photo with weights and times.) “Hm. Ok, what vehicles were before him, and after him?”\n\nTG: (Pokes around on computer, pulls up on screen, no printout.) Before me was a pickup, owed $7.50 on 100 pounds of trash. After me was a dump truck. Dumped eleven tons of scrap metal, no charge for recycle.\n\nI point out that on the photo of my car he printed out, it looks like the dumptruck behind me has it’s front tires just on the scale. My “in” weight must be my car plus the front half of the dump truck. \n\nCop says I can go. \n\nTG: “But, he still owes at least $7.50!”\n\nCop: “No. You can’t prove that he actually dumped anything. You don’t have accurate weights.”\n\nI start to say I’ll pay the $7.50 minimum but the cop looks at me and says “Go. Now.”\n\nI go.\n",

I have had an iud for two years now. Recently I've been having some pain with it. So I visited a new gp in the hopes of a referral to a gyno or ultrasound, as the type of iud I have has been getting a lot of backlash from both consumers and doctors. I used a new gp  as as I have recently moved. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. We are both super commited and I dont belive that he would ever cheat. We are also high school sweethearts and the first for each other. \n\nthe conversation went like this after I described my sympoms and concerns ..\n\ndoc: are you sexually active? \n\nme: yes\n\ndoc: how many partners?\n \nme: one \n\ndoc: really? How old are you? \n\nme: 20 \n\ndoc: and you've only had one partner. \n\nme: yes, same partner for three years. \n\ndoc: really? seems a bit difficult to believe. \n\nme: well, ive had the same bf for three years. \n\nAt this point he continued to question me about this for about 2 minutes. I understand that people lie to docs but this was an entirely new level of prodding. \n\ndoc: well, i think we will do a chlamidya test. \n\nme: (done with his shit and wanted to get the hell out) fine, but when it comes back negative can I get a refferal to a gyno please. \n\ndoc: (scoffs) we can discuss that when it happens. \n\nI am literally fuming over this guys attitude towards me. It been three days since and I am still considering complaining to the right people. (Not sure if theres a board or something) But at this point I am going back to grab the negative saying youre a prick and driving the 45 mins to my regular GP.\n\nedit\nultrasound not mri\n\nUPDATE!! So I went back in today and the converstation went like this...\ndoc: (disbelief) so the test has come back normal....\nme: great, so now can I grab a refferal for an ultrasound?\ndoc: well, i dont really do that but I would like to retest for chlamydia.\nat this point i cracked it.\nme: actually no, im not going to do that. You've already tested for stis and I am not waiting another four days. Can I please have a print out of the negative test. (my mother always said if youre angry its fine but dont be rude it gets you nowhere.)\ndoc: why do you need that??\nme: becuase when i see another doctor i want to show them ive already had the tests and get straight to the ultrasound.\ndoc: Well i guess i can give you both.\nhe prints out and signs both the refferal and and test results a high tail it outta there. 100% getting the contact details of the right people+ so rude!!!",

She gives me a disgusted look and rudely says \"no!\" She then goes around me and to help an older couple and talks to them all sweetly and nice. \n\nSo I go off and find another employee a younger female and ask her the same question. She leads me to the area where all the sewing stuff is and looks around. She then told me \"it looks like we sold out of it. There will probably be more in a couple weeks\" I smile, thank her and go on my way to checkout at the same time looking other stuff.\n\nAs I waited in line I was behind a girl and her friend (male to female trans) they smile at me and I return it. Then Miss old crabby employee goes and opens a new checkout and helps all the older customers, but as the two girls go out of my lane and go to her lane. She suddenly closes it and leaves. (The lines were still long, but I noticed only filled with young adults) \n\nI let them go ahead of me since they didn't have a lot and the whole time the cashier that was checking me out was glaring at the old lady employee. I don't know if she was getting fired or something and she was spending her last days being rude to the young, but nice to the elder.

        "text": "This was one of my mom's horrible customer service exchanges, and I heard it from her and my brother. \n\nOne time my mom (who is a little bigger) went to a pharmacy store (The one that rhymes with \"all means\") to pick up some stuff. One of her items was a 2 liter of Coke. We were having sweet pork in the slow cooker so we use Coke in the recipe. \n\nWhen she got to the front, the guy took her Coke and other stuff and just offhandedly said \"You know Coke gives you diabetes.\" as he was ringing her up. My mom just kind of looked at him and said \"Okay, well, I am using this to cook tonight.\" He then said \"It doesn't matter if you cook it or not, and the way you're going you'll probably get diabetes in the next few years.\" He said it so matter-of-factly that my mom said she didn't know if he was serious or not. Then she said \"Okay thanks for the advice\" sarcastically, and he replied \"Anytime. I always am here to help people be healthier.\" So the douchebag WAS being serious! \n\nSo my mom goes home offended and tells me and my brother. She has been called plenty of fat names before and it pissed us off to hear this. Little did I know that he drove down a few minutes later to this store, went up the the front with a Coke, bought it without looking away once from the cashier, and then handed it to him after the sale. He just took it out of the bag and handed it to him. He said \"This is all for you. My mom with the future diabetes wanted you to have it. She said you really like Coke.\"\n\nMy brother is super outgoing and not scared of anyone, so I believe he said it. What a douchebag though, right?",

        "text": "This was one really bad experience I had as far as customer service. \n\nMy fiancee, my sister and I were driving home from college. We had been driving about 11 hours and were tired, were in the middle of nowhere, and still had a long ways to go. We decided to stop at a gas station and QUICKLY run in and grab some subs at a famous sub sandwich chain. This was THE ONLY place for a long time and we were hungry. \n\nSo my sister and I get in line while fiancee gets gas. The girl making the sandwiches is maybe 17, and looked very bored with her job. We watched as the girl made the person in front of us's sandwich. She SLOWLY peeled each individual slice of meat..... laid it on the bread. Then grabbed aNOTHER piece. laid it on the bread. Then grabbed a piece of cheese. She literally was yawning and looking around as if our time didn't matter. The lady seemed very impatient, and it took about 7-8 minutes to finish this chick's sandwich.\n\nWe stood there and watched as the girl walked to the back (we thought to grab bread or something) and didn't come back. For like 5 minutes. Finally she came back and asked for our order. We gave it to her, and it was just two easy foot long sandwiches. Just a Turkey sub and a Tuna sub. Easy. We didn't even want them toasted. \n\nReddit, I swear to you, we stood there for no less than TWENTY minutes while this imbecile made our two sandwiches. At first, my 17 yr old sister wouldn't let me say anything to her because she was embarrassed but i was starting to get pissed. I was starting to sigh loudly (to politely show my annoyance). Finally I very nicely said, \"Hey, you seem to be having a hard time making the sandwiches. Is there someone else working that could help you?\" She just replied \"No I'm fine\" and continued. Then I said \"Actually I was trying to be nice, but I meant that we are kind of in a hurry and have been here about 20 minutes, and you are going INCREDIBLY slow to make some pretty easy sandwiches.\" She literally just looked at me. \"If you want them then just wait. I'm making them\" was all she said. \n\nAt this point even my embarrassed sister had had enough. \"K well we have been in the car all day, and like you are LITERALLY peeling the meat and veggies so slowly...\" my sister then made the motions in an exaggerated way of her PEELING the food. The girl didn't even reply. Finally she finished, and there were a bunch of people in line behind us who were sighing too like I had been. I told her that I needed to talk to her manager. She gave me the number and we left, angrily.\n\nIn the car, we called up the manager. It was the voice of a JUST as annoyed sounding teenage girl. My fiancee talked and basically said \"hey, look we just wanted to let you know what was going on... and we wouldn't call unless this really had set us back on our trip, which it kind of did.\" She just said \"okay\" the whole time, no apology and nothing sounding like she cared.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be in a position where I will NEED to go back there, but if I am, I won't.

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago, but I was reminded about it today because my husband wanted to order pizza again, but I was still too mad to do it. \n\nHubby and I ordered pizza delivery one night, like ya do when you're feeling lazy and hungry. The way our front entrance is, we have a raised porch that you go up 3 steps, open a gate, and you're at our door. Most people stand at the top step and knock on the door without even opening the gate. If not, they'll come in the gate and close it behind them. Not this genius! He opened the gate and left it open. So when I opened the door, my two large Labradors shouldered their way out and decided to go exploring. \n\nNow these aren't just any old dogs. Pepper is my service dog, who I'd be an absolute mess without. Midas has epilepsy and if he misses even a single dose of medicine, he's guaranteed to have a cluster of seizures. Without human intervention (translation: a lot of drugs) he won't survive a cluster. \n\nI yell for my husband and grab my car keys (Midas loves car rides, we've gotten him back from an adventure by asking if he wants a car ride once before) and take off running after them, while idiot pizza guy says \"oh, are they runners? I have a dog who is a runner, too.\" Now, I don't expect him to help chase my dogs. He doesn't know my dogs and doesn't know they won't bite him or anything like that. But don't stand in my way, *gate still open*, and make comments. It took hubby and I about 10 heart-wrenching minutes to chase the dogs down, including Midas almost getting hit once, and we pay for our pizza and idiot leaves. No apology, nothing. *You know why you got zero tip.*\n\nHubby called the store as soon as he got his breath back to speak with the manager. Manager was pissed. Their policy is you shut any door or gate that was shut when you got to it, for exactly reasons like this. Manager said she was sending the driver home for the night as soon as he got back to the store, and she'd have a chat with all their drivers about this policy. Also gave us credit equal to what we ordered that night for next time. If she hadn't been so good about it, I would've insisted on a refund instead.",

(sidenote) It was this huge burger with grilled cheese buns and a steak knife through it, and if you finished it in like 10 minutes you got 3$ off your meal or something. I don't remember. \n\nSo this one time when we went:\n\nWhen the waiter brought us our drinks, I noticed that my cup had a lipstick stain on it. I waited for him to come back and he begrudgingly brought me a new cup. Strike 1. \n\nThen when the food came out, I opened my napkin (not a paper one, a fabric one) to get my fork and a piece of CHEWED gum was inside of it. It was half stuck to the handle of the fork so I didn't want to touch it. Asked the waiter for a new one because, ew. He took the napkin and fork and left for about 10 minutes. I was slightly annoyed (usually pretty understanding and nice about this stuff) just because I had to wait to eat my food while I waited for my new fork. Eventually he comes back. I open the napkin and THERE IS A PIECE OF GUM in it still. Literally this waiter took the folded up napkin, took out the gummed up fork and stuck another inside with the knife. I refused to even touch my food now just because of that. We saw the waiter walking and called him over. My friend is a lot more outspoken than I and basically asked the waiter why he didn't just give me a new napkin. We politely showed him the gum and he just said \"Oh, I thought you just wanted the clean fork\"\n\nUm... No douchebag I also would like a napkin without gum on it. \n\nUgh. Strikes 2 and 3. \n\nTo top it all off, we ordered two pieces of cheesecake to share at the table. We didn't get the cheesecake for 45 MINUTES. And the restaurant was far from full. Also, it was half frozen when we got it and felt like it had been microwaved (Some parts were melted some parts weren't). \n\nNeedless to say the guy got a $4 tip on our $75 bill. I don't tip well for bad service, and I never went back there again.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. This is unfortunately a story about bad customer service, and I’m sure some of you have similar ones. I’ve worked retail and have my own business, so I'm generally super forgiving with employees. A lot of times incidents aren't their fault, but this was one of the times where it was truly the employee. This is kind of long, so grab a snack and a cup of coffee.\n\nI get my prescriptions filled at a local pharmacy / gift shop that is just two miles from my home. I love the family who owns it and they only employ their own family members, with the exception of if the Pharmacist in the family gets sick for an extended period of time, then they would bring someone else in for a few days to fill prescriptions. The entire family is full of the loveliest, happiest, most helpful people and it is a joy to go there. \n\nImagine my surprise when I went in one day and was greeted at the prescription pickup counter by the most miserable woman on earth. I thought she was possibly just filling in for a family members who may have gotten sick and they were short handed, like they did with the Pharmacists. That sadly was not the case. I had multiple incidents with her over the span of nearly a year, but these are the worst four. \n\n*Incident One*\nI approached the counter and she immediately says, \"What do you want?\" I gave her my name, with the spelling of my last name, and she asks me if I'm sure I'm spelling my last name right. (I have an easy last name with a weird spelling, so I always give someone my name and then automatically spell my last name.) I thought she was joking at first, but she was not, and I quickly learned that her saying things like this and thinking it's a valid thing to say was just the hallmark of her personality. She did end up finding my medication and rung it up. When it came time to pay, she gave me my total and I pulled out a $20 bill and handed it to her.\n\nNow, what you have to know about the situation in order for it to make sense is that my bank and the pharmacy are right down the road from each other. I had just gone to the bank and gotten $20 out via someone at the counter handing me the money inside of the bank, so I had double checked that it was a $20 bill. I never carry cash on me unless it is necessary, but I always grab cash before going to this pharmacy, because they're a family owned pharmacy and I hate to run my card and have them get charged a fee for it when my prescriptions are typically between $1 and $5. However, the medication I was picking up on this day was one I had never had before, and every so often one will be $15 or so dollars, so I grabbed a $20 to be safe. \n\nWhen the employee handed me my money back, it was change for $5. I tell her I gave her a $20. She says I didn't and she doesn't even have a $20 in the drawer. I'm upset, because I know that I gave her a $20. It's the only cash I had on me - I didn't even have small change and I had the $20 stored in a separate compartment of my wallet all on its lonesome. I even show her my bank receipt stating that I was given a $20 not even five minutes earlier, and she still retains she has no $20s in her drawer. \n\nI thank her and tell her that, since they aren’t busy, I will just go and grab the owner and have her recount the drawer to be on the safe side, as that’s how sure I am that I gave her a $20. Around the same time, the pharmacist notices something is wrong and comes over. I think what may have tipped her off is that the woman is suddenly riffling through the drawer at a quick pace and trying to throw change at me to get me out of the store. I tell the pharmacist what's going on, she opens the drawer, holds up a $20 bill from the drawer so I can see it and the employee can see it, and then gives me $15 back in change. As I'm leaving, the pharmacist is pulling the employee aside to talk to her, and I think this is hopefully the end of the situation and pray that she is just filling in. \n\n*Incident Two*\nThe next time I go to pick up one of my medications, the same woman is there and is equally as rude. She hands me my medication and it rings up for much more money than it should be. I tell her that something can't be right, and without even pausing or checking, she tells me it is. I ask her to please double check. She refuses, insisting it's correct, and then adds that I should keep track of when my co-pays go up in price. The thing is, I do. Unlike the last medication I picked up, this is a medication I get consistently, so I do know the price and I know it hasn't gone up, especially not to the astronomical amount she is trying to charge me. \n\nI know something is wrong and I'm panicking internally because I can't afford what she's telling me it costs. I call the pharmacist over, who looks into it and tells me that the employee was supposed to run my insurance through the system, but it was never run through. So basically the employee was trying to sell me the medication at the full price, without insurance coverage. She claimed that my insurance information wasn't in their system - that was her excuse - but it was in their system. This is also when I learn that this woman is a pharmacy tech and not just a lady who checks people out at the pharmacy counter. I wanted to be like Sweet Sugar Brown and yell, “I didn’t grab my shoes or nothing, Lord Jesus. I just ran out.” \n\nThe pharmacist runs the insurance herself and my total comes to its normal price. All is well. The pharmacist directly takes my money, hands me my medication and I leave. Maybe this time things will change? \n\n*Incident 3*\nI went back a third time. The same woman was there, and once again, was instantly snippy with me. I give her my name and spelling, and she says there's no medication there for me. I ask her to please check and make sure they got the prescription, as the doctor's office should have sent it in earlier that morning and it was now late afternoon. I told her that if they didn't get it, I still had time to call my doctor's office and have the prescription resent. She gets into the system and tells me that I came in earlier to pick up my medication. The thing is, I didn't come in earlier to pick up my medication, and I'm not sure what's going on at this point. \n\nShe and I are going back and forth again, because she says her system is telling her that I picked up my medication earlier. She legit accuses me of trying to get the meds twice. They're antibiotics. Trust me, I don't want them twice. I'm just getting ready to call my insurance to see if the medication really was ran through their system earlier in the day to verify that the prescription was at least filled and there was a possibility of it somehow being picked up, because honestly, I didn't trust this employee. Just as take a few steps to the side of the counter to do this, a girl who looks absolutely nothing like me - different height, hair, everything - walks up the counter and sets a bag with medication in it onto it. \n\nThe girl proceeds to tell the employee that she was given someone else's medication. The employee says that she doesn't know who would do that, and the girl flat out tells her that she was the one who handed the medication over to her about twenty minutes before. I walk over to see if it's my medication, because I'm suspicious, and as soon as I look at the bag I see my own information, plus the medication information, stapled to the top of the paper bag it was in. They use the papers on the bag to scan the medication into the system when the medication is picked up, so it's not as if somehow my medication ended up inside a bag with her name on it, or visa versa. \n\nNow, why the girl didn't double check her medication and notice this before she left is beyond me. I personally check my medication before leaving the pharmacy to make sure there wasn't a mix up, but that's just me. From what I could ascertain from the heated conversation that followed was that the girl had the same first name as me and was also picking up one medication, but that was it. The employee at the counter didn't even check to make sure she was giving the girl the correct medication. She simply called the girl's first name, the girl came to the counter, paid, and she handed over the medication by placing the paper bag the medication was in inside of a plastic bag with the other items the girl had purchased while checking out at the pharmacy counter, so the girl never even saw the medication bag until she got home and was unpacking the bag. The employee never verified her full name, showed it to her, or anything before shoving the medication into her bag. \n\nNot only did this almost cause a huge issue for me, because my insurance had paid for a medication I hadn't gotten plus the script had already been filled, so I couldn't just easily get the medication filled again without a huge hassle, but now the girl who took my medication had all my personal information. This pharmacy puts everything on the paperwork that is stapled to the bag with the medication to assure there are no mixups, and every time I've been there they've always double checked at least my name, birthdate, and city in which I lived with me. However, the information on the bag includes my phone number, address and my insurance ID number, which is also my SSN.\n\nAfter all of this, the employee has the gal to tell me that she doesn't know how to fix it and I'm going to have to straighten this out with my insurance and doctor's office, because she can't just give me the script she had given to someone else. She then tells the other girl that she doesn't know how to refund her for the medication she already paid for, ie, my medication, but she can give her her other medication. Obviously this isn't acceptable, but by now the pharmacist hears the commotion and is over at the counter trying to figure out what's going on. It's only ever the pharmacist and one other employee in the pharmacy, since it is small and family owned. The pharmacist gets the story, reverses the initial transaction, refunds the girl who had my meds for what she paid for my meds and gives her the correct meds directly. \n\nAs she walks away to re-do my medication, as the girl before had admitted to opening it, the lady tries to shove the medication on me. I tell her that I cannot take it, as I don’t know if it has been tampered with, and she tells me that the girl ahead of me only admitted to opening it and I need to stop making a fuss and take it. The thing is, this is illegal in our state. If someone else leaves with a medication and admits to opening it, it has to be thrown out and refilled. The pharmacist swoops back in quickly with my refilled medication, has me pay my copay, and that's that. \n\nBefore I left, I did pull the lovely older woman who owns the pharmacy aside and told her that I can't come back to the pharmacy anymore, but would still buy some other items for them. I gave her the rundown of the prior incidents, plus the one today, and encouraged her to please talk to the pharmacist to verify this, as I've had to pull the pharmacist into the situation more than once. I expressed that after today I was worried not only for my safety, because she seemed to not be paying attention to what she was doing, but also my personal information. The owner apologized and said she was a family member they were helping get on her feet, and her son, who usually had her job, had moved away. \n\nTotally disheartening, but I continued to frequent the store after that for three plus months and never saw her there again. Therefore, I decided to give their pharmacy another chance. I shouldn’t have. \n\n*Incident 4*\n\nI kept this story on the sidelines and almost didn’t post it, because I hadn’t seen this same woman at the pharmacy in awhile. I went in yesterday for some medication and there she was again. While waiting in line, a man came up behind me and let go of a string of explicit words that basically amounted to him being quite upset he had to put up with the woman at the counter because she was incompetent, so clearly it’s not just me that has issues with her. \n\nI waited in line for twenty minutes while she waited on one man. His prescription came out to a lot more money than it should have. When she first handed him his change back, he thought she was purposely short changing him (Like she had done to me.) only to realize that he was never given the total, knew how much the medication should cost as it picks it up monthly, and finds that the total is way higher than it should be. \n\nHe argues with her over it only to find that she is stunned to find out the medication is actually eye drops. She thought it was cough syrup. This starts an entire conversation between the two regarding how she could possibly run the medication as the wrong medication when the name is printed on the script and the bottle. Somehow she did. She offers to only give him one bottle, since it will be cheaper. The guy’s eyes nearly popped out of his head as he spent time explaining to her that the prescription was for two bottles and he needed both. Her response was a continual, “But it’s cheaper to just get one and you’re complaining about the price.” Yes, she actually told him he was complaining.\n\nIn the end, he ended up having to get the actual pharmacist who was filling the prescriptions to step in, call his insurance, remove the fee for the cough medication and then get his actual prescription run through. Once he did, the woman at the counter refused to give him the difference in price back. He had to call the pharmacist over again, because counter lady could not figure out why she owed him money. \n\nFinally, it was my turn. I tell her my name. She can’t find medication for me, shrugs it off and tries to take the next customer. I refuse to move, as my prescription had been called in eight hours earlier, it was a medication that was pre-boxed with nothing to count, and I knew the pharmacist was quick, efficient and it was ready. Counter lady rolls her eyes at me and yells over to the pharmacist regarding my medication. The pharmacist yells back, “It’s been sitting in this box back here for hours waiting for you to come get it and sort it into the bins to hand to customers.” You could hear the disdain in her voice as she said it.\n\nNeedless to say, I’ve made it a point to change pharmacies today.

        "text": "I thought this story would give all of you a little chuckle. \n\nI own my own business where I hand make and sell items for cats and dogs. Therefore, I spend way more time than the average human in my local fabric store, so much so that the women working there have gotten to know me by name and genuinely ask about my life. \n\nI was minding my own business and picking out enough thread to verify my status as “Crazy Cat Lady Riding the Kitten Train to Meowville” when a woman and her child, who was about ten or so, came into the same aisle. The child was old enough to not be a monster, but that didn’t really stop him, however, after seeing how his mother acted, it was pretty apparent why he was how he was. \n\nThis kid was all over the place. He ran into an older gentlemen with a cane and didn’t apologize. He ran into several peoples’ buggies and didn’t apologize. He was loud and rude and would pull something out and not put it back. His mom laughed every single time he ran into someone and she didn’t apologize either, even when someone made eye contact with her. If he would pick something up and not put it back, his mom would immediately go and do the same thing and then say, “I’m just showing you how stupid you look when you do something like that.” She never bothered to put what she moved or what he moved away.\n\nThe longer I was in the aisle, the harder they came to ignore. The mother basically goaded him into doing everything he was doing, and was just as loud and obnoxious as he was, if not worse.  She was easily in her late 30’s to early 40’s, so she also knew better. He walked up and pushed me away from the thread and just stood there at one point, thinking he was being cute and blocking me. I completely pretended like he wasn’t there and just kept grabbing what I needed, which was luckily the kind of thread that was stored higher on the shelves than he was tall, and he eventually got bored with me and went back to his mother. They walked away before I did and I was happy to be rid of them.\n\nThen I got to the cutting counter, and guess who got there .2 seconds before me, took a number and managed to break the thing that you pull numbers out of while doing so? Yep. I stood back while the kid managed to run into more people to stay out of the line of fire, and when it was their turn, these two didn’t disappoint. Every time the young girl at the counter would start to cut a fabric, he would pull on it and then laugh. Immediately after, his mother would do the exact same thing and repeat, “I’m just showing you how stupid you look.” That’s not what’s happening, but okay. It took the poor girl twice as long to cut their fabric than it should have, to which the woman huffed and puffed as if it was her fault, before finally getting her fabric and leaving. \n\nI ended up having the same girl cut my fabric as had cut theirs, and once they were around the corner, I apologized for them and said, “I love every kid but those two.” \n\nShe looked me dead in the eye and said, “Since you're in here often and I feel like I can tell you this, I feel the same way.” \n\nTwo weeks later I was back at the same store. There was a child screaming in the aisle way for more than a half an hour. When I finally got to the cutting counter, the same woman looked at me and said, \"You know I wouldn't say this to anyone else, but do you perhaps have a puppy and espresso for that wonderfully vocal child? I have just ran out.\" These ladies make my day. ",

        "text": "Last week, the boyfriend and I had traveled to another town for a concert. We had booked a room in a small one story hotel. Post concert drunk munchies hit and we decided to order a pizza. It was 12:30pm.   \nThere was only pizza place that delivered that late so I placed an online order for pizza and bread sticks. Got an email with the eta being 1:30 am. That was fine, we were still amped up from the night.  \n1:30 came and went and no word from the pizza place. It was a saturday night so it was probably busy and we just kept waiting. I had selected to pay with cash btw.   \n2:15 hit and we turn out the lights and go to bed, angry amd hungry. 2:30 we get a call on the hotel phone. They went to the front desk and them call us instead of calling my phone or coming to the room.   \nThe boyfriend was pissed and unplugged the hotel phone. Couple minutes later teres LOUD knocking on our door. We ignore that as well. Then I got a call on my cellphone. Set it to silent.   \nThey finally left and we went back to sleep. Next day, I looked up reviews for the place, and there were at least 5 comments saying the same thing happened to them, with really late delivery, and also a few comments about moldy food. Was the worst pizza experience ever.",

He proceeded to pay by card, but was then told that the minimum to spend on eftpos was $10.\n\nSo, the man went back to look for something else to add to his shopping.\n\nSince I was the next in line, the old cashier lady motioned me over so she could ring me up. I already knew that my kind deed for the day would be to buy the guys mangoes.\nIt was $7, I had it spare and it wasn't hurting anyone or myself.\n\nShe rang me up, and I paid for my shopping, and then proceeded to ask her to let me pay for the mans mangoes as well, just so they wouldn't get mixed up in my shopping.\n\nShe got annoyed with me because I wanted to buy this mans mangoes. I asked her to please take my cash for his mangoes, so I can do something nice for the day. She hounded me with:\n\n**\"Do you know this man?\"..**\n\n\"Ahh No, but I just want to buy his mangoes for him and do something nice for the day\"..\n\n**\"Don't be silly! Don't buy his mangoes! He's a stranger!\"..**\n\n\"Um, Yes, and all I want to do is buy his mangoes for him\"..\n\n**\"You don't know him though so why would you do that? Put your money away\"..**\n\nA line had formed behind me with the guy who wanted to buy his mangoes right behind me, and I don't know if she was just a salty as lady or even if she heard me say that I wanted to do something nice, but after her rambling on about me \"buying a strangers mangoes\" because \"I didn't know him, that I'm silly\" and \"why would I do that?!\", I just looked at her one more time and told her sternly that \"**I just wanted to do something nice for someone else today**.\" I gave her a meek smile and I think she finally got it in her head that I was just doing something nice for a stranger.\n\nA few seconds turned into a few awkward minutes of trying to buy mangoes as a nice gesture. She finally silently took my cash, I proceeded to hand the man his mangoes, and I went on my way, definitely not looking back.\n\nThe guy did come up after me to thank me for buying his mangoes, in which I also told him it was just something nice I wanted to do that day and to enjoy them.\n\nI haven't been back.",

        "text": "I stumbled across this sub the other day and after reading a bunch of the stories here I think I have a pretty suitable story myself, happened about a week and a half ago.\n\nSo I was in the States for a sports tournament and there is this restaurant beside the hotel that specializes in the waitresses more than the food (I'd never heard of it but one of the US guys on the team had been to one in his home state and said it was good, was Celtic themed which seemed interesting). So we decide to go, calling ahead to make a reservation since there are 14 of us.\n\nWe get there and it's pretty packed, we have a big table in the back and after sitting down two of the waitresses come over and start talking with us. The usual deal for this type of restaurant is your service includes lots of flirting (don't really care for that myself, was super hungry after the games and just wanted some food), and the two waitresses decide to split up the table down the middle to make it easier, one taking each half.\n\nThe waitress on our half didn't really do much flirting (which I was happy for since I thought it would mean she was more into giving good service) and took our drink orders. I am a fan of ciders, so I order a raspberry craft cider that I had never heard of.\n\nDrinks come around and our waitress is giving out the drinks (only two of us on her half ordered, since the rest were under 21). As she is handing me my drink I read the label and it is for a pumpkin spiced beer by the same craft brewery. I politely point out that it is the wrong drink, and she takes it back to the bar saying it was a miscommunication. No big deal, I'm pretty easy going with this type of thing, I get that mistakes happen and don't really mind too much (also tend to apologize even when it's the other persons fault lol).\n\nAnyways, she takes it back to the bar, and comes back a little while later. She apologizes and again says it was a miscommunication (odd that she doesn't take responsibility). I apologize as well and take it from her, I see that it is a different label on the bottle so I assumed she had gotten the correct drink (didn’t look too closely as I was too busy apologizing, man sometimes I hate my national pastime). As I take it, she walks off and I turn the bottle around to look at the front of the label and lo and behold, it's the same shitty pumpkin beer. \n\nA little confused now, but still not mad (I had assumed that I had misheard her when she came back the second time) I patiently waited for her to come back (~15 minutes or so), without touching the beer.\n\nShe comes back to take our food orders and I ask her about the beer. She says that they are out of the cider that I asked and so she brought the pumpkin beer.\n\nOdd, but I apologize to her for not hearing her say that before (I don't think she did, but apologizing is kind of a national pastime for us), and ask her if I can get whatever cider is on tap. She's ok with that (also says something about it being a miscommunication again...) and leaves without taking the pumpkin beer.\n\nYou might see where this story is going, and I did at the time as well; I didn't touch the other beer until she came back with my new drink. It took a really long time for her to come back with my drink, really long as in the food was already coming out before she came back.\n\nAnyways, as she is giving me this drink I ask her if she wants the pumpkin beer back. She looks at it and says \"nah\" and walks off.\n\nAt this point I'm like ok, this is to make up for the shitty service so far (although it tasted like garbage so I ended up giving it to one of my buddies who drank it).\n\nFood is meh, but I knew what to expect from a place like this. The cider that they brought me is actually pretty good, but they brought it so late that I hadn't finished before we were all done, no big deal though, I didn't mind sitting around watching some of the sports on TV.\n\nThe receipts start coming out and our waitress hands them out, asks who got what to give them to the correct people, but then gives me mine while saying \"The on tap cider guy\". I'm the last one to get it and she walks off after giving me mine.\n\nI look at my receipt and as I thought might happen the pumpkin beer was added. Not only that though, they messed up my meal, charging me for 2 pounds of wings instead of the burger, ~$6 more expensive.\n\nSo I wait for the waitress to come back (cue another 15 minute wait) and let her know of the discrepancies. She takes the bill back and gets money for the other guys.\n\nAnother 20 minutes later she comes back with my bill (and change for the other guys) and says she can't take the beer off because I drank it. I tell her that that was why I specifically asked her if she wanted the beer back, and tell her I won't pay for it. So she says that she will talk to her manager about it.\n\nWhat happens next? You guessed it, 20 minutes of waiting. At this point I'm actually watching her to see what she does, which is taking care of other tables and flirting it up with them.\n\nEventually she does go and get the manager, who comes over to the table, asks me if I drank the beer, I tell him I asked her if she wanted it back and she said no, he asks me to clarify that she said I could keep it which I do. He was quite terse while talking to me, which I found odd since usually when managers come over they are apologetic and what not (unless the customer is an asshat).\n\nHe goes back to the register, comes back with my bill and offers a quick (read poor) apology for the trouble. I don't really care because I finally have my bill (half hour after everyone else has left, except one of them who stays with me).\n\nI check the bill and am rather confused. He handed me a bill that had been completed, with the price of the beer deducted off (so he took the price off of someone else’s already completed bill). I put on my coat, walk to the waitress, ask her if I'm good to go, she says yes offers a weak apology, and I leave.\n\nSo I'm still a little pissed off because I wasted 45 minutes or so dealing with their garbage service instead of going back to chill (was also very tired from the games), but due to their garbage service and apparent plethora of miscommunications I got a free meal (and one of my friends got some money taken off his meal lol). So I can't complain. Still not going to go there again.",

Now they never order drinks, usually because being Asian they're not that familiar with the names of things.

What happened was when the bill came there was a glass of wine, a regular nonalcoholic drink and a soda. When they spoke to their server she mumbled something and grabbed the bill to make changes. When she came back the wine and the nonalcoholic drink was taken off the bill, but the soda was still on there. Calling their server over again, they told her to take it off the bill; mumbling something she took and finally returned the correct bill. \n\nNow I've worked in the restaurant business before, I understand that mistakes happen. Once is a mistake, twice? Now that's just deliberate. \n\nWhen they told me, I was furious on their behalf. How dare people take advantage! Either people don't care to do their jobs properly, or it was done on purpose to try to pull one over these \"non-Americans\". Either way I'm furious. ",

        "text": "This happened a couple years ago and still pisses me off to this day.\n\nBoyfriend and I decide to go out to eat at this burger place named after a type of bird where they have unlimited fries. It's kinda out of our way, but we barely went out to eat and wanted to have a fun little date night. \n\nIt's pretty busy when we get there because it was a Friday night. We get seated after having to wait ten minutes for a table, but no biggie.\n\nFinally, after ten more minutes of waiting at our table, our server Joe appears. He immediately greets us by saying \"Wassup guys!\" Cringe inducing. He asks us if we've ever been to this restaurant before, boyfriend replies that we've been one other time but not to this location.\n\nJoe says \"Well we're the freaking best so all the other ones can suck it big time!\" \n\nMy boyfriend and I just look at each other wide eyed, and he takes our drink and appetizer orders. Ten minutes later, he drop off the drinks with no straws and no dipping sauce for the onion rings. He's nowhere to be found at all and ANOTHER ten minutes almost go by before a waitress nearby must have noticed me looking super pissed and asks if we need anything. She gets us our straws and dipping sauce for us even though we aren't in her section at all. That's when Joe decides to make an appearance.\n\nHe takes our burger orders and leaves again. Half hour goes by and still no food. Not a huge deal for me, it was a Friday night and they were packed, and I had eaten an app so I wasn't starving. Except Joe is sitting two tables away gabbing with some dude about the girls he banged over the summer.\n\nNo joke. That's what they were talking about. My boyfriend tries to wave at Joe to ask where the hell our food was and I see Joe glance over and... ignore us completely and keeps talking. I'm fuming at this point and tell my boyfriend I just want to leave. The lovely waitress comes by again and asks if everything is okay.\n\n\"No.\" I tell her. \"We've been waiting nearly 40 minutes now for our food and Joe is sitting over there talking.\"\n\nShe looks over to Joe, huffs, and tells me she'll be right back. SHE brings out our burgers and apologizes profusely, to which I smile and say \"Don't be, it's certainly not YOUR fault.\" She then walks over to Joe and words are exchanged, the only ones I could hear were her saying \"...now get off your ass and go serve your table\" before walking away to her section.\n\nOur burgers were cold at this point but I was so mad and hungry I just wanted to eat and leave. Mid chew, Joe walks over and asks us how things are. I say nothing because I'm angry as hell and my boyfriend asks for more fries. Joe gets them surprisingly fast, and says after setting them down, \"Wow, you eat a lot! How much can you eat in one sitting?!\" to my boyfriend.\n\nWe just stare at each other for another moment before I turn to Joe and say \"Excuse me?!\" My boyfriend is sitting there looking embarrassed because he is a little overweight and the comment was so unnecessary. \n\nHe then goes on to tell us about how once he won a pancake eating contest at Denny's. \n\nHe finally fucks off and we finish up. He comes back a few minutes later and asks if we want dessert and I reply with a short \"No.\" He says he'll be right back with the bill, so we wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait some more. \n\nAnd notice he's sitting again at that table ignoring us and talking to his friend.\n\nI spot the waitress who helped us and flag her down, apologize for bothering her but ask if she could please run our card for our bill because we'd been waiting 20 minutes. She looks at Joe, and says \"Unbelievable. I'll be right back.\"\n\nWe promptly have our card run, bill paid, and are ready to go. I reach into my wallet and pull out $13, find our waitress, and hand it to her, thanking her for taking care of us even though we weren't her table. She thanks us profusely. \n\nAs we were leaving I saw Joe immediately FINALLY get up and go to our table. My boyfriend didn't want to tip him, but I said leaving a small tip would prove a point. I left three pennies. \n\nI went home and immediately emailed the manager who I then spoke to on the phone the next day and he was appalled at Joe's behavior. I dunno if he ever got fired because I never went back.",

We don't get to eat out often, so it's pretty important for us to have a nice experience.\n\nDuring dinner my wife is holding an edamame bowl in one hand and using it to put the skins in. Suddenly the manager appears and starts pointing at us and yelling in Korean. We were wondering what the hell was happening when a server runs up and explains the situation. The manager mistakenly thought she had taken the bowl off the conveyor belt without also taking the plate underneath it. She had done no such thing, and we explained that she was just *holding the bowl.* Server apologizes, manager doesn't. Maybe he doesn't speak English?\n\nLater that same night the manager calls the cops on a guy whose card wasn't working. Manager wouldn't allow him to leave and come back from the ATM, saying \"it wasn't about the money.\" Funny, so he *does* speak English, but not to us, apparently.\n\nThe situation gets sorted. The guy with the non-working card tells the manager that if he has something to say, they can talk outside.\n\nWe leave. Manager follows right behind. He yells, \"Hey, you!\"\n\nNo way is this prick talking to me like that. I turn around and he says \"Not you.\" Apparently he was shouting to the guy.\n\nIs this the way you treat your guests? I'm about to tell this guy off but my wife is scared shitless by this guy now and she wants us to just leave. That we do, and never come back.\n\nAdvice for managers: Use basic courtesy towards people giving you money.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\n\n",

        "text": "So the ISP of my dorm has enabled AP isolation which makes it impossible to use my Chromecast. I called the ISP's tech support department and just told them my Chromecast wouldn't work (so they wouldn't have any preconceptions about the problem). They indicated that they'd implemented measures that prevent devices from communicating with each other on the network (AP isolation).\n\nAt this point it seemed like this guy knew what he was talking about. So I asked him if I could work around this by using my own router and what he told me next was just ridiculous. He told me that they do not allow users to use their own routers because they run on the same radio frequency as the access points they provide which would cause interference; thus, causing issues for other users.\n\nI said okay and hung up because I wasn't even going to try to talk to this guy. Let's dissect their reasoning and talk about why it's completely ridiculous. It doesn't actually take too much dissection.\n\n1. WiFi access points (including my router/AP and my ISP's APs) always run on the 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz frequencies\n2. Other wireless devices such as phones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, remote controlled cars, wireless mice/keyboards, and others run on these frequencies\n3. Even microwaves can cause interference with these wireless signals\n\nOkay, in my apartment I can count off the top of my head over 10 wireless devices that are always on. So, would adding 1 more wireless device cause any issues? NO. We have had 0 issues with the wireless network here besides those caused by the ISP.\n\nFurther argument for why this is ridiculous. Many wireless networks at schools, offices, and even some homes, use at least two wireless devices in their infrastructure in order to provide wireless access. They do this to provide wireless access throughout their location. If adding more wireless devices caused interference, there would be a gigantic fundamental issue with the world's networking infrastructures. But, clearly, there is no interference issue.\n\nI want to call support back and tell them why they're so dumb, but I know that it's a lost cause. Even if the tech does know this, which he should, it's probably just a canned response that fools most users.\n",

        "text": "So, a girl I know works at a women's clothing store in the mall. I understand that retail workers are not often treated with as much respect as they deserve, but when she posted a rant on Facebook recently about \"disrespectful customers,\" I was a little bit taken aback. Not because she dislikes disrespectful customers--that's reasonable. Her idea of what is disrespectful was what floored me.\n\nI personally tell retail workers that I'm \"just looking around\" all the time, because often I've been dragged to the mall by a friend and I'm not actively trying to find anything in particular myself.  According to this girl, saying that is ridiculously rude and it's our job, as the customer, to entertain her while she works.I get anxious about talking to strangers, and being told that I'm \"on my high horse\" for not making conversation is something I'm so over hearing. \n\nI'm honestly just curious as to what other people think of this. Is she in the right here? Is she batshit crazy? I want to know what other customers/retail workers think!\n\nHere's her rant:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/XgIO4",

        "text": "So I live in California where medical marijuana is the shit and life as a stoner couldn't be better. My favorite weed store is about 5 minuets away and I end up visiting them pretty darn often. A few trips ago, they had a rather unruly visitor while I waited in the lobby. I don't remember ever seeing an upset customer in a dispensary, especially not like I have in other stores where people completely lose their minds because they cant have their way. This was, however, one of those people, and at, no less, a dispensary.\n\nFirst of all, as far as they go, this dispensary is the most hippy run I've seen. All the employees like to talk about energy or love and they seriously pride themselves on their organic, naturally grown, good quality weed. Basically they are the Whole Foods of my towns legal pot market. They have always just been super helpful and awesome, and I would happily go out my of my way just to give them my business, if I had to.\n\nSo this one day, I was waiting my turn in the lobby when someone buzzed in at the door. I was lost in sudoku immediately upon sitting but it was difficult not to notice him. The man threw the door wide open and stormed toward the small check in window at the far end of the room. He took exaggerated, long strides and overly heavy, quick steps. The girl at the window was always very sweet, good at making small talk, pleasant, and patient, every time. He was jittery, and I instantly got the impression he must have been on something (other then weed), either that or coming down from something. He was tapping his foot almost uncontrollably as he leaned on the small counter, looking around quickly with his head low. He had bent down so his full weight was on the small shelf meant for patients to set their things or pass documents, and his voice was trembling from the rhythm in his leg. The nice girl never had a chance as the man asked immediately, \"is there a wait?\"\n\nIt was hard to hear the desk girl through the window and over the mans foot, vibrating on the floor, but I heard her say something about ID and recommendation, the standard materials for new patients. The man made a \"TSS-S-S\" noise and pulled out a wallet from his front pocket. He could have been trying to call her a something nasty in parseltongue but if so I don't think his inflection was right, probably due to the muggle drugs. He tossed his ID through the window, and as he did, said \"I come here all the time, you never ask for this. How long is the wait for returning?\" Just to explain \"returning patients\" need only provide valid California ID at check in as opposed to also providing your doctors note each time, it's literally the only benefit of \"returning\", anywhere you go. I've heard it's this whole crazy **law** that you have to present ID, every time you want some legal weed. He wasn't looking good already, and to top it off.. Don't you other working folk just LOVE the 'I know more about your job then you' type customers?\n\nWell a couple moments passed with the man, still very fidgety, bent over at the shelf of a counter. I heard the girl ask something and the man put his hands out, exasperated, and said \"YESSSSS!\", mocking her, or trying too. I think at any other shop he would have been kicked out right about here, but this place is different and that girl is maybe just a little to nice. This time I actually heard the girl say \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find you in our system Sir. Are you *sure* you visited us before?\" She still sounded as bright and genuine as always but again it was lost on the man who flipped his head back, snapped it back down aggressively and starts going off a bit.. He was getting louder then before and leaning down further so his face was practically all the way through the little window now. He started cursing all about how he knows what hes doing, this is bullshit, he's never had to do this the other times, he wants a manager (\"THE REAL MANAGER!\"), how \"a while\" wait is just retarded, then he makes the comment \"stupid bitches all just want fucking attention\"! \n\nHe had started to rock himself back and forth, moving his weight from one foot to the other and back again. The guy had his back to me and I was absolutely starring at him at this point, honestly getting a little uneasy. I could see through the window that there were several people gathering behind the girl in the back office now, obviously I was not alone in my unease. One of the men walking up behind the girl (a bigger guy, usually very quiet when I was in before), interrupted by shouting \"HEY! You need to back up out of our window man!!!\" Mr. Mary Crack Cocaine didn't like that, at all.\n\nHe did back off from the window, but he started yelling into the open window, for the long hall this time. He clapped a couple times randomly, and spewed more profanity, graduating now to calling the employees the \"n\" word and fags (except the longer versions). The girl backed up a bit and the other guy, once known as The Quiet One, moved forward and was yelling pointedly back at the man in short bursts. First asking him calm himself and then threatening to remove him. At one point the guy turned around to me, waved both hands at me and said waiting for my \"bitch ass\" to go in, before *he* can go in, would be ridiculous. He also rants that since I will be let in sooner, some how that also supported his theory that every one working here is a fag.. I think he was implying I was also a fag but I got a little lost a couple times, trying to follow his fast flowing, hate filled words. Side note; I'm legitimately gay, so technically he's right on a couple counts.. I suppose one could argue faggy-favoritism, **if not** for the delicate social standards of a thing called a LINE (or QUEUE)! Side, side note; I don't expect any one working there knows I'm gay mainly because its never come up. No one has really mentioned that whole \"fag\" part either which would have probably been the most offensive part (for me, at least). Which it wasn't all that offensive to me since frankly, I have no respect for a stranger or their opinions who is so blatantly not interested in earning it. Basically, that bitch ain't shit *snaps*.\n\nBack to it!\nTwo of the guys in the back suddenly moved away from behind the desk and flashed out of sight, pretty obviously coming around. Mr. Quiet was yelling back at the unstable man still, and had just made it clear he was no longer welcome but I think the man never intended to be all that welcome. Mr. Quiet began agreeing with the man, patronizingly so, saying, \"ya, we do expect you to wait\", \"no, a tie dye shirt wouldn't have helped\", \"no, I don't remember every customer\", \"yes, I do know the managers\", ect. Pretty soon though, Quiet Guy switched his tone, too many fucks given perhaps, with all the homophobia and racism too, he started addressing, that you know what terrible man? \"NO! Turns out we don't want your business!\", \"Ya, apparently we ARE turning away a vet!\" \"NO! It's really not that sad for us!\" and then finally, \"GET OUT!! NOW!!\". They continued to yell at each other but the man seemed in a hurry to leave. He was making his way to the entry, one long sideways step at a time, still leaning down to direct his obscenities through the window. Once, he burst forward back toward the counter in jagged steps like he had lost complete control of his feet. He made gestures like he was going to hit them as he advanced, swinging his elbows and fists into the palms of his opposite hands. \n\nQuiet Guy never quit, even egging him on, leaning his whole head and shoulder out the window. After one of the mans weak lunges and as he retreated once more, one foot sliding limply behind like a bad attempt a moon walk or gansta lean, Mr. Quiet said, \"yaya man, untuck that tail from between your legs long enough to get back over here and I'll put you down!\" Golden. The guy got half way out the door when the men finally made it out of the back office, just to my right. He shouted \"FUCK YOU [n-wordas]!\" and pointed to the men, \"I WONT BE BACK!\" and then \"FUCKIN FUCK YOU FAGS!!\" He tried to slam the door but the spring assist meant his hand faltered and slid off so that he hit himself in the thigh. More gold. He walked passed the tall windows in front, banging the middle finger of the same self abusing hand along the glass and shouting more \"fuck\"-ery. Shiny gold. I scoffed aloud, \"I wouldn't come back either after embarrassing myself like that,\" I thought.. Bronze, good one herpsen. He was still yelling in the parking lot, and I heard a couple more emphasized \"fuck\"s \"n\" words and even a \"Jew\", I think.\n\nThe back office came back together and were convening around the security camera display. Everyone was incredibly apologetic to me and the other couple customers that had been in the bud room, just off the lobby, with all the action but none of the show. The front desk lady, who was quiet for most of the ordeal, had retaken her place and called for me to go back after a minuet. She sighed as I went by and rolled her eyes with a smile and an apology. Mr. Quiet ended up being the one to help me out and he gave me a free edible for being a good sport, and especially \"since he called you a bitch,\" he said awkwardly. Again, I wasn't really all that bothered by the whole thing so I joked about it with him another bud tender who had been back there the whole time and had only audio references. I mentioned I was just stoked no one got hit which was more decent bronze material. I also thought it was cool how they all handled it.. Everybody jumping to action so quick. As soon as he made the comment about women wanting attention, everyone seemed on alert, worried for their college on the front lines.\n\nOverall my biggest take away was this;\n\nIf I had a nickle for every time I had to listen to an incoherent, moron, customer, making counterproductive points in attempt to justify an illogical thought process, SIMPLY because it \"was/is my job\", I could actually afforded the good weed. So with that in mind it's nice to see a group of professionals that aren't so worried about business that they are going to allow the abuse of their employees. Instead, it seemed they were all ready, willing and prepared to defend their little weed family! It has yet to come up in my visits since and I don't care nearly enough to ask if anything ever came of it. It seems apparent though nothing more has come to affect my favorite weed store at least, and I'm sure Mr. Mary Crack Cocaine is doing just fine.. fine enough.. for him.. Whatever honestly.\n\nTL;DR guy came into my local medical marijuana dispensary, either crazy, high as fuck, or low as fuck, and proceeds to lose his shit simply because, according to the records, he hadn't been there before.",

        "text": "Notice the title says \"ordered\" not \"received\".\n\nNormally I'm very patient at restaurants. I don't mind waiting a while for my food, and even more so if it's busy. Yesterday, I had the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nI came in, it was really slow because it was around 330 at that point. After 5 minutes of standing waiting for a table, a girl comes over and seats me. Everything is still going smooth.\n\nShe hands me a menu and says that my server will be right with me. There is maybe 2 other people in the restaurant.\n\nAnother couple minutes later my waitress comes by and asks me what I want to drink, I ask for water and also tell her I know what I want to order (a burger and fries). In the middle of me saying this, her coworker walks by and she turns and says something to her, I couldn't hear what it was. It messed up my flow a little but I was still ok.\n\nThis is the part where it went downhill. I was sitting at my table playing games on my phone and waiting for my water to come. It had been about 20 minutes and I was kind of thirsty. I start looking around for my waitress and I spot her behind the bar laughing and talking to her coworkers.\n\nI walk up to the bar and stand there awkwardly until one of the girls asks me what I need. I tell her that I'd just like a water. My waitress turns and says \"oh, here, I was gonna bring it over\".\n\nI took my water and walked back to my table. Another 20 minutes go by and I'm getting kind of annoyed waiting for my food and she hasn't come over. I look again and she's still standing there behind the bar not doing anything.\n\nI get up again and say \"hey sorry, just wondering if you know how long my food will be?\" She looks at me kinda weird for a sec and says \"it should be ready soon?\" And goes back to talking.\n\nI stand there for a couple seconds with a wtf look on my face and go sit down again.\n\nI wait another 15 minutes and she still hasn't moved. At this point I've had it so I just get my stuff together and head to the door. As I'm opening the door I hear her say \"Hey!! I said your food will be ready soon!!\"\n\nI just looked at her with the same wtf look and said \"Sorry I'm not going to wait anymore\" then the part that just put the icing on the cake was her saying \"well who's gonna pay for the food then?\"\n\nI just looked at her, shook my head and left. Honestly never had service that slow/bad in my life. I was hoping for opinions on this. Was my reaction appropriate? How could I have handled the situation better?",

        "text": "Sorry for my grammar and I tried my best at a title\n\nSo today I went to a brunch place with my friend. They had this sign that says please wait to be seated. Well while we waited to get seated a small Asian lady pushed my friend out of the way and pushes a couple (who were ahead of us waiting for their friends) out of the way. \n\nShe goes straight to a table and sits down. I would get if you were looking for a friend and you found them, but nope she just pushed everyone out the way and ignored the sign. Just to sit at a table that was empty and not ready yet.  \n\nThe servers all saw that and pretty much ignored her and went to the people who were waiting. We got a person who leads us to a table and then later leads the group to their table. They did serve the little Asian lady after leading the people who waited on the tables that were ready.\n\n",
