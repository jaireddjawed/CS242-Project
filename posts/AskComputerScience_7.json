So far I studied on my own, I know a little but not enough to get a job. \n\nDuring our monthly meeting my supervisor said he supports my idea of going from marketing to software development and will help me get there within the company. \n\nThey mentioned contacting the CS department and just talking to people there which to me is very odd so I was hoping to get some answers here :\n\nIs it possible to do what my supervisor suggests? it sounds too good to be true\n\nKnowing I have at best an intern level, what would talking to people there do? Wouldn't it be just annoying for them? \n\nAnd last, is there any \"easy\" tasks that I could start doing? Im sure its widely different depending on companies so my question is more general\n\nIm pretty excited about my supervisor idea but I guess I am not sure if it's very realistic.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "To be clear, I'm not asking about what assembly language instructions might be used or anything directly related to programming languages really.  Rather, to look at a really simple example, say the value “5” is encoded as a binary number on some sequence of registers and we want to copy that value unto some other sequence of registers elsewhere in the device. What actually makes this happen in terms of the hardware?  I know the exact mechanism will vary depending on the type of device, but I'd like to get some idea of what might happen in general.\n\nLike, I know all the bits are just voltages above and below some predetermined level with transistors acting as the “switches\". But how does that actually act to “load\" a value into a register (or, more likely, set of multiple registers)? I asked a similar question on Quora recently in regards to transferring a value encoded via a sequence of flipflops to another sequence of flipflops and a couple people responded that you could just physically connect the outputs of the first set of flips to the inputs of the second set, and that makes sense for a large circuit that's being manually manipulated.  But what about inside an actual modern device where obviously no one is going inside and manually moving around wires?  I think I learned how this works previously when I took a course in digital logic design that culminated in building a schematic for a relatively simple microprocessor (though it certainly didn't _feel_ simple at the time, looking at the very detailed schematic), but that qas several years ago and I don't remember the details very well.\n\nBackground knowledge: I'm an EE major, addition to the course in digital logic design I took a few years ago, I've had two semesters of circuit analysis (the second semester focused heavily on transistors and particularly MOSFET and CMOS circuits and other semiconductor devices like diodes an op-amps) and I'm currently taking a course in semiconductor physics.  I've also had an intro course on assembly code and computer architecture, and I recently completed an 8 month internship in firmware engineering, which was largely low-level c programming and running the code on a physical circuit I'd set up myself on a breadboard.",

Our software devs can implement these but need to see some examples of implementation (language doesn't matter, but flowchart would be nice).  What's most important is how to generate a secret key on both server and client programmatically, so server can verify the authenticity of the request and that it hasn't been ran more than 10 minutes before or after the timestamp the key was encoded with.\n\nI'm somewhat familiar with the concept and want to flesh out a reference doc for our software engineers, but don't know if it has a standard name, so i'm having a hard time looking for published articles/examples without getting a whole lot of unrelated results (many about cryptocurrency)",

I have been working on a project as a hobby for me and my friend t use that would allow us to talk with each other. Imagine this in your head if you will both screens would look the same  and would have a Alphabet Wall A to Z painted with lights hung above and around the letters with each letter having a light above. For me to send a message I would need to click on the message for example to say hello click the letters HELLO and then on the other screen the lights above HELLO would all light up in order. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would go back and forth, but also think would help if I could physically type HELLO besides just always clicking on the letters. I am doing this strictly for fun only. I have tons of others ideas and the right person to work on this with me would be willing to listen to me and know if my ideas are feasible or not. Some of those include being able to leave message on the page for your friend to read next time they come on, having a password feature for security, possible music and sound effects, etc. I would like the look and feel of it as if it came out of the world of Stranger Things. If anyone would like to help me out with this please contact me. Best way to reach me is pm to make sure I see your message. This is not a paid job just something I am doing for fun would love if you like Stranger Things as well.",

I'm currently working in Ocaml.\n\nThe two things I know I'm not following is the data structures involved and how they interact.  I'm also not following how using a set to create the partitions doesn't end up in quadratic time where, as far as I understand what I've read correctly, should be linear time instead.  I'm probably missing a lot more than just this though.  One thing I read suggested that Quicksort is a type of partition refinement algorithm, and I can sorta understand the view.\n\nSomething like pseudo code might be helpful.\n\nI apologise for not being more precise in my question, but I don't have enough of a mental model to know where my misunderstandings are or how to improve my question.",

        "text": " \n\nHello everyone I've never posted before so I may not know how a couple of things work but I've made a fairly basic BLE sketch where a central connects consecutively with 2 peripherals, checks the rssi with each of them, and then writes a value to the characteristic of the one with the most powerful rssi. My problem is that the bleCharacteristic.writeValue() function is not going through at all and to confirm this I made a while loop at the point where the value should be updated on the peripheral and the program stops there which means that the value is never written in the first place.

They could all be aligned in one row but then the DRAM chip would need a huge demultiplexer. With the array approach, the design can get by with one demultiplexer and one multiplexer of half the size\"\n\nThis seems to imply that the column/row layout means the number of selection lines on the demultiplexer is halved when compared to the number of selection lines on a RAM chip with a linear layout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**However, my confusion comes from the following:**\n\nIn the figure, it was clear that there were 4 column selection lines and 4 row selection lines. 4+4 = 8 so 8 total selection lines. If the same capacity RAM chip was laid out linearly we would have 16 selection lines, so the formula makes sense.\n\nBut if we take a ram chip with a capacity for 1024 addresses, in a linear layout it would require 1024 selection lines, but in a row/column layout, wouldn't we only need 32 rows and 32 columns (32 \\* 32 = 1024) and therefore only need 64 selection lines (which is much less than half of 1024).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs my understanding of a row/column layout wrong, or is this correct? Drepper did not provide any further examples of this, so I have no way of checking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thank you in advance!**",

If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)\n\nfor example if you had (a,b) --&gt; you should test them in all cases (note that you are not passing in a,b just using the instance variables you already have!)\n\nsumLimit(2, 3) → 5\n\nsumLimit(8, 3) → 8\n\nsumLimit(11, 39) → 50\n\nsumLimit(11, 99) → 11\n\nsumLimit(99, 1) → 99\n\nluckySum() --&gt; Given your 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is 13 then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.\n\nfor example if your 3 ints were in the order (a, b, c)\n\nluckySum(1, 2, 3) → 6\n\nluckySum(1, 2, 13) → 3\n\nluckySum(1, 13, 3) → 1\n\nComboString(String str) --&gt; Given a string, compare it to the String in your instance Variable and return the shorter of the 2 + the longer + the Shorter\n\nFor example if you had the following 2 strings, this is what it would return. Your method should only take in one String\n\ncomboString(\"Hello\", \"hi\") → \"hiHellohi\"\n\ncomboString(\"hi\", \"Hello\") → \"hiHellohi\"\n\ncomboString(\"aaa\", \"b\") → \"baaab\"",

The question is as follows:\n\nA system has 32-bit virtual addresses, 26-bit physical addresses, and a page size of 4kB. Each entry in the page table contains 4 bytes. The system can run a total of 16 processes simultaneously. The system also contains a two-level cache hierarchy. The first level contains an instruction and data cache and both are 64kB and have block sizes of 16B. The instruction cache is directly mapped while the data cache is 4-way set associative. The second level cache is shared between the first level instruction and data cache and is 1 MB. It is 8-way set associative and also has a block size of 16B. All caches support write-back for writes. The system also contains a TLB where each entry in addition to address translation contains a valid, dirty, and reference bit.\n\na) Calculate the size of the page table.\n\nb) Calculate the size of each block entry in the three different caches.\n\nc) Calculate the size of an entry in the TLB.\n\nNot particularly looking for solutions, just explanations about how translations and pages work in general.

I am okay with working on something I do not like or might make me miserable. What I bring in at this moment is knowledge and readiness to slog my ass off to finish the work. I would prefer working with a company as that will allow me to work on the company project and at the same time, gain some working experience.\n\nI have been applying through links and websites, but the process is taking too long, and time is of utmost importance to me right now. I will be happy to share my resume, show sample codes of my work, etc to people who would want to see it.

I do not mean to be rude here to anyone, but on seeing this people just downvote it because, I do not know, maybe they get offended, or they just do not like it.\n\nPlease don’t do it. I need the post to have a wider reach so that I have a chance of getting help and it is easy to comment something mean or make my post invisible sitting comfortably somewhere behind a screen. \n\nAt this point, a lot of money and time went behind my education. I know the moral grounds of it and that is why, my ONLY priority right now is finishing it on time, and I am ready to give it my all.

In order for my api to access the data (from e.g google ads platform) i have to give the api the access code of the user which is simple if it a single account, but when i have multiple users using the same api how should i handle it? How can i give the api the access code so it can pull the data (from e.g google ads) for each user? What is the name of the technology that needs to be considered here? \n2. How would i handle the data from multiple users when i got it? I am thinking of using an sql database. Should i give all rows a unique identifier for each user and send it under the same table or should i make a new table for each user?\n\nI am a built lost on the terminology of my questions which has given me a bit of a headache when trying to google them.  \n\nI am thinking of building this using node.js and next.js.\n\n:-)",

Here's some code to help explain what I'm asking (the setArray method would take two parameters: an index and a value):\n\n    public class Foo\n    {\n        public static void main(String[] args)\n        {\n            Bar bar = new Bar();\n            String[] arr;\n      \n            bar.set(3, \"New Value\") // This?\n            arr = bar.getArray();\n            arr[3] = \"New Value\"; // Or this?\n        }\n    }",
