Say I‚Äôve got 25kish in savings I can just lay low, enjoy a work free life for a while, maybe do small online side gig things for money. Has anyone here done this? Any tips for saving as much money as possible doing something like this? \nAppreciate any help. \nThanks",

        "text": "Hey everyone! \n\nIf you were hit with the winter storms like me, I'm sure you're in the same boat I am. Seasonal depression has finally kicked my butt and with the end of the holiday season, I'm ready to curl up and do nothing. \n\nIn the past, I've used this time to do nothing. That includes cooking. I usually find myself either creating unhealthy struggle meals or ordering out. Now that I'm actually üí´brokeüí´ I've found myself turning to one of my comfort foods that is quick, easy, and relatively healthy to make: Japanese Curry!\n\nTo do this, I find some golden curry (usually 3 dollars at Walmart, but there are even larger cheaper packs at your local Asian market) and fill a giant pot with canned or frozen veggies. My protein of choice is usually chickpea since I'm vegetarian, but if you use the flashfood app, you could find awesome half priced meat products near you to put into your pot! I usually go for a mix of peas, carrots, potatoes, corn, onion, and as noted chickpeas ‚ù§Ô∏è after heating the veggies and boiling the water, I pop in the curry stock and call it a day. While that finishes up, I'll usually make a big serving of jasmine rice. It usually lasts me 4 or 5 dinners. \n\nUnrelated, but if you need to spruce up your rice, my partner loves the lemon ginger rice from Hello Fresh. It's one of the few recipes I still follow from them and ginger holds + freezes great (look it up online and the recipe will be there!)\n\nAnyways, I figured I'd share my little \"meal prep\" with others who really struggle this time of year. I hope no matter what, you're finding ways to take care of yourself and eating your veggies ‚ù§Ô∏è have a great night, everyone!",

It is important to note that we barely eat any meat these days and I'm not recommending anyone do that. I also realize not everyone has time to cook or knows how to cook from scratch.\nBut if you are interested, this is how I do it.\n \nFor the most part I cook from scratch. I buy staples, in bulk if possible. Dry beans, rice, 25 lbs of flour and sugar at a time, pasta, oats, seasonings of all kinds, boullion, stuff like that. I have a pantry full of canned basics. I keep freezer bags full of a couple types of chopped meat, sometimes I throw a handful of ham or bacon into whatever I'm cooking. We don't buy much processed food except boxed macaroni and cheese because that stuff is good. \nI have chickens and a large garden. I save, freeze, preserve everything I can. \nWe do buy milk, cheese, bread and butter but not regularly. \nI feel like I'm leaving things out. We eat out about once a month.\n\nWe eat really well, have huge variety and never go without.",

I don't really know why this is, but I tend to do things at the last minute. I do things at the last minute, both at work and in life, and it causes me a lot of stress. So at the end of this year, I am thinking about a habit or two that I can introduce into my life in the coming year. \n\nWhat I'm doing now:\n-I have a monthly budget and more or less manage to stick to it, and manage to save and invest about 10-15% of my income.\n-I have prepared a grocery list of products that I always have at home so that my husband and I don't have to order food when we are in a hurry. I buy them regularly and the number of spontaneous food orders has decreased significantly.\n-Sometimes I cook on a Sunday - I peel and chop the vegetables to eat the following week, so cooking is very quick and efficient.\n-I also started to keep an eye on discounts at the local pharmacy to get the best price on vitamin D and omega3.\n\nSomething I would like to do, but I am not getting it right now:\n-Making gifts in time. This year I bought Christmas presents on 24 December because I had a lot of last-minute work to do at mu day job. Some last-minute work lead to other and it's like a vicious circle. Ideally, I would like to make my own presents because I know how to sew, crochet and knit, but I have never done it in time to prepare a present.\n-I would like to make a little snack for a party I'm attending or organising myself, instead of buying snacks again at the last minute.\n-I would like to plan my work and leisure schedule so that I can work and relax properly and sometimes even socialise.\n\nDo you have any easy-to-implement planning tips? I have tried some productivity courses but they worked for maybe a month but after that I felt drained and robotic.\n\nFor context: 30F, I work full time and do a lot of voluntary work. I don't have children and I live in an apartment, not a house.\n\nP.S. Sorry for broken english",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/zv5pu9/an_experiment_in_cutting_my_grocery_bill_buying/",
        "text": "Hey r/frugal,\n\nI recently conducted an experiment to see if I could cut my grocery bill by buying produce loose and packaging it myself. I've seen a lot of people recommend this trick as a way to save money, so I wanted to put it to the test and see if it really works.\n\nHere's what I found: buying produce loose and packaging it myself did indeed save me money. For example, I used to buy a bag of pre-cut carrots for $3.99. But when I started buying them loose and cutting them myself, I was able to get twice as many carrots for the same price. That's a savings of $3.99 every time I go to the grocery store!\n\nAnd it's not just carrots - I've found that this trick works for a lot of different types of produce. By buying loose and packaging it myself, I've been able to save anywhere from 20-50% on my grocery bill.\n\nNow, I know this might not work for everyone. Some people might not have the time or inclination to cut their own produce, and that's totally fine. But for those who are looking to save a little extra money on their grocery bill, this might be worth a try.\n\nThanks for reading, and happy shopping!",

On top of that they asked to borrow twenty dollars to put in said box then tried not give back to me. They were like ohhh well I paid shipping are you going to give me half on shipping. Luckily they sent me the twenty dollars ,but it‚Äôs not the money. It‚Äôs about the attempts to extort,gas light, and trying to focus me to pay for stuff on the back end which makes me feel unsafe. I‚Äôm saver and frugal because it‚Äôs empowering no surprises and allows me adjust my budget accordingly. Plus allows me to save for real emergency like I need a family law lawyer earlier this year without my vigorous budgeting I wouldn‚Äôt have been able too .Additionally, I need a car badly which what I‚Äôm saving for. No family or parent to help just me super unfortunate but getting there .The only issue is that they are spiteful now they are requesting I pay 60 dollars for adding me on there dental even though it‚Äôs was free before all this because I want boundaries regarding my spending and priorities. Also they pressured me to go half on a cake I didn‚Äôt even want. They ambushed me even though I tried to tell them no I don‚Äôt  want this cake why do I have go half. This has me wanting to cancel Christmas dinner now because for Thanksgiving dinner I was left paying the whole bill my parent cooked but between the crab,garlic noddles,and drink my parent paid for nothing when they were suppose to cover everything outside crab since that cost the most. \n\nNot to mention, my parent basically trying to say if I don‚Äôt buy them stuff I‚Äôm not showing appreciation for her. I‚Äôm like I can appreciate you and not buying you everything you want because your overspend all the time. I tried to say everything I said in the  forum in non judgemental reaffirming way non hostile but it triggered my parent anyway. I love the help I receive sometimes it‚Äôs convenient though my parent charges sometimes. For context, I have a toddler with ASD single parent live in HCOL in college part time job, this parent is the only help I get. Thank you for reading. Having boundaries is a huge part of being frugal when financial literacy is so low in USA.",

Am I wasting energy by having the basement vents open? It is quite cold down there with them closed but we really don‚Äôt use the space.

Exact reasons why it was so high are too long to get into right here but you can read about it in [this post](https://livepoordierich.com/index.php/2022/12/24/500-energy-bill-for-christmas/). \n\n**Energy saving options**  \nI was wondering how you can save some energy costs. Here is a list of measures to reduce your energy bill:\n\n*  Lowering the room temperature\n*  Wearing warm clothes.\n*  Off-peak hours\n*  Insulating your house \n*  Shorter showers \n*  Solar panels\n\n**Reccomendations by US department of energy**  \n[The US dept](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/reducing-electricity-use-and-costs) of energy also has some great recommendations on saving power:\n\n* energy-efficient appliances and electronics¬†\n* energy-efficient lighting¬†\n* energy-efficient space heating and cooling¬†\n* Electric water heating¬†\n* Reducing your ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù appliances.¬†¬†\n* Get rid of extra appliances you don‚Äôt need (extra refrigerators etc.)¬†\n\n**Travel hacking / arbitrage**  \nYou can also save money on electricity by planning your time off / vacation in the winter. Some retirees I know have done this (planned a trip to Asia). \n\nDo you guys have more ideas for saving on electricity to add to the list?",
