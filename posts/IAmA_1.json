Fast forward and my baby cousin coincidently is born in the month that my child was meant to be born .My baby cousin has my whole entire face its eerie , I remember my ex and I had a joke (before we actually got pregnant ) that he would get a DNA test if our child came out blonde because I'm mixed and my families children always come out looking crazy different .My baby cousin now is also turning blonde as he gets older.I never regretted my abortion until I met him , the love I have for him is insane and I always think .Is this the love I would have had for my child?It's weird because my mum loves my baby cousin so much too ,she always comments saying she doesnt understand why she has so much love for him in her heart but she just does .My cousin and I were never close and suddenly his kid was born and now him and my family are closer than ever before .To make things even weirder his girlfriend and him were together for the same time that my boyfriend and I were together when they got pregnant .It fills me with regret because I thought I would have been an awful mother because I didn't have a degree YET , I didn't have alot of money .But seeing my cousin who isn't rich , has a job as a nail tech but she still gets by .She looks so happy , im not any happier than I was .I think I've realised that it doesnt matter how much money I have , I wanted to give my child the perfect life and didn't want them to [suffer.So](https://suffer.So) I let them go and I kind of hate myself for it .",

        "text": "It‚Äôs possible that Reddit takes this post down, but I hope they don‚Äôt because I deserve to be heard. \n\nMy name is Jaime Rogozinski, and in 2012 I created r/wallstreetbets. For nearly a decade, I cultivated, cared for, participated in, and helped grow the community. In 2020, I wrote a book called WallStreetBets, planned a trading competition and filed for a WallStreetBets trademark. Reddit then kicked me out, opposed my registration and filed several WallStreetBets trademarks of its own. \n\nThree weeks ago, I sued them. \n\nI‚Äôd like to share as much as possible but due to this being an open legal matter, I‚Äôll hope you understand if I skip some questions or refer to the publicly available filings. I don‚Äôt pay my lawyers enough for this. \n\nReddit was [quick to point out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-sues-reddit-10fa1168) that I‚Äôve sued for personal gain, by having quietly waiting 3 years after being banned from WallStreetBets before suing. This is easy to clear up because there are currently *two open proceedings*, I didn‚Äôt just randomly decide to sue. I just got tired of being picked on:\n\n* Reddit vs. Jaime Rogozinski ‚Äì [Reddit initiated this against me three years ago](https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91264289&amp;pty=OPP) and is still ongoing. I chose to keep quiet in good faith effort to find a mutually agreeable solution, [despite having ample opportunity to speak out](https://jaimerogozinski.com/media). \n* Jaime Rogozinski vs. Reddit ‚Äì this is me having had enough and deciding fighting back. You can read the [full lawsuit here]( https://twitter.com/wallstreetbets/status/1626002704547053568?s=20).\n\nCrux of the argument ([or if you prefer a video recap](https://youtu.be/2BdXbbAlnsM)):\n\nReddit claims they kicked me out for monetizing WSB but this is a pretext. Tons of subreddits, users, and moderators monetize on Reddit, *including moderators from WSB before during and after I was removed*. You‚Äôre able to find examples by just randomly browsing Reddit, no need to single anyone out.\n\nReddit claims WSB moderators didn‚Äôt want me there, I get along fine with them (except for maybe one). They claim the community doesn‚Äôt want me [but that‚Äôs bullshit because they barely know me](https://youtu.be/2BdXbbAlnsM?t=396).\n\nThese arguments don‚Äôt make any sense. \n\nWhy was I kicked out for promoting my book on WSB, while my fellow mods who promoted merchandise remained unscathed? I spent far too long focusing on the pissing match I was having with said mods around the time of my removal and not noticing the timing of my trademark registration. I promoted my book--for two months--without complaints from the community, fellow mods, or Reddit. But after I filed for the trademark, it only took two weeks to get marked with the scarlet letter.\n\nMy real issue stemmed from trying to claim ownership over my creation. **Reddit systematically takes intellectual property from its users by registering trademarks** and I posed a threat to this. A quick search for Reddit‚Äôs trademarks shows the sorts of IP they‚Äôve taken: *Explain Like I‚Äôm Five*, *ShowerThoughts*, *Ask Me Anything*, *NoSleep*, *Today I Learned*, *Nature is Fucking Lit*, *Am I The Asshole?* And yes, they own *IAMA*. Which is insane to me considering today‚Äôs outrage on Reddit is limited to [‚Äúmoderators who work for free‚Äù]( https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11dqf9r/reddit_is_a_company_that_will_go_public_later/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), never mind forfeiting rights to their content. While there‚Äôs evidence of others having tried to put up resistance against Reddit on this, I appear to be the first degen to stand in front of them with both feet planted firmly on the ground. \n\nReddit has been draining my account for three years with legal fees, trying to wear me down and is now trying to paint me as an opportunist. They‚Äôre resorting to intimidation tactics I only thought belonged on TV shows like flooding everyone around me with subpoenas, serving court summons to disabled family members or in-laws whose only connection to this mess is a last name they married into. \n\nI‚Äôm here to say that I‚Äôm not backing down, I‚Äôm fighting for what‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm fighting for what‚Äôs mine, and I‚Äôm fighting for those who have been unable to fight for what is theirs. Reddit is welcome to serve my ex-girlfriends or dead relatives if they want but I won‚Äôt give up. I may be the first ape with enough testicular fortitude to take on this multi-billion-dollar conglomerate, but I know I‚Äôm not alone when it comes to content creators who have been taken advantage of by Reddit, or by extension social media platforms. \n\nI‚Äôm not staying quiet anymore. I have nothing to hide. Ask me anything. [proof](https://twitter.com/wallstreetbets)\n\n**tl;dr** Reddit. We build it, they take it.",

I've made music since I was 12 but only started taking it seriously in the last 6 months. My first song Constellations was featured on a couple of blogs and playlists. I've decided to take it seriously because the current market for CS majors is abysmal and there is no telling how much more volatile it'll become.\n\nOn the music side of things, I make indie/pop music to convey stories and experiences I've had. I just released a song yesterday called [Redhanded](https://open.spotify.com/album/0hqhDrCvVw2z0sn6Hsf3ST?si=HmnORtM-QrW-FCoooH0ytw). Honestly, Tiktok is such a hit-or-miss marketing channel that Reddit is my next best option. I used to be quite the Redditor back in the day but I made it a New Years resolution to minimize Reddit usage. Kind of ironic huh.\n\nHonestly, I'd say I'm a decently interesting person so ask away. \n\nLink to Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/album/0hqhDrCvVw2z0sn6Hsf3ST?si=HmnORtM-QrW-FCoooH0ytw](https://open.spotify.com/album/0hqhDrCvVw2z0sn6Hsf3ST?si=HmnORtM-QrW-FCoooH0ytw)\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/SkymistBlue/status/1631401382782566404](https://twitter.com/SkymistBlue/status/1631401382782566404)",

I worked at Meta for 8 years and most recently led the Digital Marketing Team. I know that making a career change can be daunting, but I'm here to tell you that it's possible ‚Äì and that it's worth it.\n\nBefore I became a marketer, I was an electrical engineer. I loved the work, but I found myself craving something more creative and dynamic. That's when I discovered digital marketing, and I haven't looked back since.\n\nOver the years, I've had the privilege of working with some amazing teams and companies, including Facebook. I've also written a book on the topic, 'The Ultimate Digital Marketing Guide', which I hope is a valuable resource for anyone looking to break into the field.\n\nSo whether you're a seasoned marketer looking for new insights, or someone considering a career switch, I'm here to help. I know that the industry can be complex and ever-changing, but I believe that with the right approach and mindset, anyone can succeed.\n\nSo, what do you want to know? Ask me anything about digital marketing, career transitions, or even about my own journey. I'm excited to connect with all of you and share what I've learned along the way.\n\n[Proof](https://ibb.co/XVBhdV7)",
