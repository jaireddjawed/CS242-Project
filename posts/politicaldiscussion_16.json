        "text": "Like the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Canada also has a bill of rights known as the [***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms). However, unlike the US Bill of Rights which are 100% absolute and inalienable insofar as how the judiciary interprets those rights, large parts of the Canadian Bill of Rights are subject to [**parliamentary supremacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty) In order to obtain the political support necessary to enact a new formal constitution in 1982, [**Section 33 of the** ***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_33_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms), also commonly known as the **notwithstanding clause**, authorizes Parliament or provincial legislatures to override sections 2 and 7 through 15 of the *Charter* with no legal limit. This means that by invoking this clause, they can freely enact any laws that violate the rights guaranteed in those sections and judicial review cannot stop them. All laws invoking this clause are only in force for up to five years but they could be renewed by their legislature any number of times.\n\nIn Canada, the rights that could legally be overridden include:\n\n* Section 2 (fundamental freedoms): freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and of other media of communication, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association\n* Section 7: right to life, liberty, and security of the person\n* Section 8: freedom from unreasonable search and seizure\n* Section 9: freedom from arbitrary detention or imprisonment\n* Section 10: right to legal counsel and the guarantee of habeas corpus\n* Section 11: rights in criminal and penal matters such as the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\n* Section 12: right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment\n* Section 13: rights against self-incrimination\n* Section 14: right to an interpreter in a court proceeding\n* Section 15: equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination\n\nAlthough the Canadian federal government has never invoked this clause, it has been used at the provincial level multiple times in the last 40 years especially by Quebec. For example, the Superior Court of Quebec stated that Quebec's [Bill 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_respecting_the_laicity_of_the_State) violates freedom of expression and freedom of religion but had to uphold it since the notwithstanding clause was explicitly invoked.\n\n**Should the US Constitution have its own notwithstanding clause?**",
