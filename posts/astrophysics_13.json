I understand that our current model of the Big Bang centers around what seems to be a null space, where at some point almost like the principles of vacuum energy yet without it happening in space time, there was a quantum fluctuation that initiated the big bang. \n\nNow first off - could this quantum fluctuation have been of a sub-atomic particle never seen? Such as one with an infinite energy potential that created the Universe we see by initiating some base reaction? \n\nBack to my question though and please explain if this isn't possible. I understand that the velocity of time was decided at the big bang, but couldn't space have existed before? Like....an analogy would be like this. Before you make bread, you have just flour, water, yeast and a little sugar. Why couldn't it be that space existed before the big bang and that the explosion initiated by a singularity existing within it ejected its contents in a certain 4 to 5 dimensional direction that projected a 3D area of mass that is currently 46.5 bn light years across? \n\nI mean, if space is truly infinite, but matter is not and is caused by the said quantum fluctuation creating an explosion in a certain direction, it would make sense? We wouldn't be able to see the other explosions or whatever else happened because of the 5 dimensional properties of space? Time being melded with space in the part of it we live in due to the reaction of the Singularity?\n\nI find this all so very interesting, I'm a complete noob and have no real grounding, it's just a bunch of pseudo-intellectual stuff I thought up so go easy on me. \n\nThank you.",

I have a kind of shitty undergrad GPA (3.0), but am currently sitting at a 4.0 for my masters (online at Columbus State University, so take GPA with a grain of salt).\n\nGiven that the army will pay for a PhD when I get out, and also provide me with a sizeable living stipend when I get out, I'm thinking about applying to a doctoral program in Astrophysics. I'm looking for any advice on this, especially given the change in topics. \n\nCurious about what I'll have to do differently because all my previous experience is in C.S., and also just about what to expect. I've taken a year of physics and a bunch of math, but still have a lot to catch up on physics wise.\n\nTL;DR: Have B.S. and will have M.S. in Computer Science, wanna get PhD in Astrophysics because it's awesome. Tell me stuff about things.",

I've seen the same article on many news websites where Hawking states that we need to leave Earth or we wont survive the next 1000 years. However, the news articles all say he's been saying this stuff for years, but I cant find any references, articles, or books that have him *talking* about it. \n\nHoping you all can help me out with this.",

Now, getting things back to the way they used to be is no easy task, so we are going to need a little help. I'm sure many of you are very involved in other subreddit communities and would love to put those skills to good use and lend a helping hand to help get ours back in order. We will be accepting applications and will be hiring two or three new mods in the next few days, so if you are interested, shoot us a message in the modmail. Love you all.",
