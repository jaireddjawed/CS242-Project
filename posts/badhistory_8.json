        "text": "Recently [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/8vD8U0B.jpg) sent by a friend had caught my attention, supposedly citing Gaius Julius Caesar's and Cicero's opinions on the inhabitants of Britain\n\nNow if we reverse image search the picture, it appears to have stemmed from 4chan's /pol/ board. \n\nThe problem with these quotes is that they are either woefully misinterpreted or perhaps don't even exist at all\n\n**Edit**: Also this picture is claiming Julius Caesar was an Emperor, classic badhistory.\n\n#Where did the quotes come from?\n\n   Starting off we need to know who exactly cited these quotes, googling Caesar's quote will lead us to [this author's book:  *The White Image in the Black Mind African-American Ideas about White People, 1830-1925*, Mia Bay.](https://books.google.lt/books?id=vk7kHPaKA_AC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22they+are+the+most+ignorant+people+I+have+ever+conquered%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s0fVw_UkZm&amp;sig=_sfyMLMHGylfTesaqeIQrmaxVYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5g5Xx87vYAhVTb5oKHcFEBX8Q6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22they%20are%20the%20most%20ignorant%20people%20I%20have%20ever%20conquered%22&amp;f=false)\n\nNow, fortunately, I managed to get a pdf copy on her book and we can trace her 57th footnote to this source:\n\n&gt;William Wells Brown, *The Black Man: His Antecedents, His Genius, and His Achievements* (Boston: James Redpath, 1863), 33–34.\n\nSurprisingly Mia Bay has used a very old book to get this quote from, even more interesting it is supposedly not even from Caesar or Cicero themselves.\n\n_________________\n\n##William's quote on Cicero\n\nWilliam's book is also available via pdf on archive.org, in which Mia has gained her information from this specific paragraph, page 34:\n\n&gt; Caesar, in writing home, said of the Britons, \" They are the most ignorant people I ever conquered. They cannot be taught music.\" Cicero, writing to his friend Atticus, advised him not to buy slaves from England, \" because,\" said he, \" they cannot be taught to read, and are the ugliest and most stupid race I ever saw.\" I am sorry that Mr. Lincoln came from such a low origin ; but he is not to blame. I only find fault with him for making mouths at me.\n\nWilliam does not provide a footnote himself on where he got these quotes from, however we can deduct that he got Cicero's quote from \"Letters to Atticus\".  The closest similarity I could find was in Cicero's *Letter to Atticus* book IV, chapter XVI:\n&gt; Here is the other news. From my brother's letters I hear that Caesar shows signs of extraordinary affection for me, and this is confirmed by a very cordial letter from Caesar himself. The result of the war in Britain is looked forward to with anxiety. For it is proved that the approach to the island is guarded with astonishing masses of rock, and it has been ascertained too that there is not a scrap of silver in the island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves ; but I don't fancy you will find any with literary or musical talents among them.\n\nNow Mr. Williams appears to have grossly exaggerated what Cicero meant, apparently we went from \"I doubt you will find any who are talented in the arts of literacy or music\" to claiming they are illiterate, ugly and the dumbest race he has ever seen, nor can I deduct how Cicero implied that he should not purchase slaves from England (although I guess the don't fancy could be seen as an implication).\n\n__________\n\n#Caesar\n\n**Sidenote:** Julius Caesar is an interesting fellow and his expedition to Britain is a very intriguing one that I highly recommend reading up on (Book IV and Book V of Caesar's  Commentaries on the Gallic War) or watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOCBWh5Iwm4) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrW6epBAz9Q) video.\n\nAnyways, I'm not going to dedicate as much on Caesar. I couldn't really find much on Caesar commenting on the people of Britain, so far Caesar commented on the people of Kent being the most civilized of the bunch in Line 14 of Book V of his \"Commentaries on the Gallic War\", claiming:\n\n&gt; Of all the Britons the inhabitants of Kent, an entirely maritime district, are by far the most civilised, differing but little from the Gallic manner of life. Of the inlanders most do not sow corn, but live on milk and flesh and clothe themselves in skins. All the Britons, indeed, dye themselves with woad, which produces a blue colour, and makes their appearance in battle more terrible. They wear long hair, and shave every part of the body save the head and the upper lip. Groups of ten or twelve men have wives together in common, and particularly brothers along with brothers, and fathers with sons ; but the children born of the unions are reckoned to belong to the particular house to which the maiden was first conducted.\n\nNow after this Caesar goes on the Briton way of combat via Chariots, and prior to this comment he basically explains the Geography of the British island, being of \"triangular shape\" and so on.\n\n## Also something to do with Caesar not actually conquering Britain\n\nBasic Wikipedia checking shows that Caesar didn't actually conquer Britain: \n\n&gt;No territory was conquered and held for Rome; instead, all Roman-occupied territory was restored to the allied Trinovantes, along with the promised tribute of the other tribes in what is now eastern England.\n\nAnd apparently the Province *Provincia Britannia* was established in 43 AD, long after Caesar's death certainly.\n\n# But couldn't William have meant conquered as in \"Defeated the British\"?\n\nMaybe, but William basically shows that he did assume Caesar was the ruler of Britain in the very next paragraph of Page 34 in his work:\n\n&gt; The Britons lost their nationality, became amalgamated with the Romans, Saxons, and Normans, and out of this conglomeration sprang the proud Anglo-Saxon of to-day. I once stood upon the walls of an English city, **built by enslaved Britons when Julius Caesar was their master**. \n\n_____________________\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion these quotes either appear to be fake or grossly exaggerated as shown by the very works and letters of the Romans Caesar and Cicero. Now I'm not sure why would William write this, or where did he get this information (perhaps it was outdated?), regardless it is badhistory and we ought to correct it.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\n**Sources**:\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero, E.O.

Credible research? or it's high benchmark for merit?  \n\nNo? \n\nWhy the hell not!?! \n\nAfter all, with catching headlines like  [\"Black man struck two women with aluminum bat and robbed them in Bucktown\"](https://rationalwiki.org/w/images/4/49/Capture_1d0f170ddac7b9f13db369c4ba4207f70e702b2a.png) and [\"Porn used by Zionists to destroy Christian values\"](https://rationalwiki.org/w/images/2/2a/Capture_01079b8d7b5486c4c7c8732bb633817a79d591d0.png) how can you *not* recognise it for the absolute bastion of truth it is?!?\n\nOh and here's an EU Times article from 2010 that discusses the [aliens set to arrive in 2012](http://www.eutimes.net/2010/12/three-giant-spaceships-to-attack-earth-in-2012/). \n\nA clip from the article:\n\n&gt; Three giant spaceships are heading towards Earth. The largest one of them is 240 kilometers wide. Two others are smaller. At present, the objects are beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n\n2012 was what... 5 years ago? I have yet to see **any** spaceship arrive, let alone ones that are 240 \"kilometers\" long. Oh well, I guess this *Quality News Organisation^tm* wasn't as factual as I originally thought, oh well! It still doesn't disprove the part where King Tut is Western European! \n\nSarcasm aside, here's how Carsten Pusc - the geneticist at Germany's University of Tubingen who unraveled the DNA taken from Tutankhamen's mummy - eloquently labels the notion of the Boy Pharaoh being \"western European\":\n\n&gt; [\"Simply impossible\"](https://www.livescience.com/15388-discovery-channel-tutankhamen-dna.html)\n\nAs for the r5 for r/CringeAnarchy, It's not to difficult to disprove. For one, even if it was true (that KT was Western European), it wouldn't say too much. Tutankhamen wasn't that all that impressive (no offence to any Tutankhamen's out there). He didn't have many historical achievements to his name and was horribly inbred. He had a cleft palate, a club foot, and possible hormone disorder. This was mostly due to the practice of brother-sister marriage that Egyptian dynasties practised for millennium. In fact, pretty much the only reason KT is remembered to this day was for having his tomb discovered by Howard Carter and Lord\n\nThe second reason that it's wrong is because Tutankhamen didn't construct any of Ancient Egypt's Great Pyramids. In fact the last one (Khendjer's Pyramid at Saqquara) was constructed centuries before he was even born.\n\n\nI'll analyse some of the comments which I can nitpick. For fun I guess?\n\n&gt; [MLK.

The FBI asserted that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) organization which King headed was controlled and funded by the Communist party and spent years trying to prove it, making King the target of an extensive surveillance program intended to gather evidence documenting ties between the SCLC and communists. But the Bureau was unable to uncover any credible evidence of active participation or funding between the Communist party and the SCLC, as David Garrow chronicled in his exhaustive study of Martin Luther King and the SCLC\n\nThe same goes for the \"adultery\" tidbit.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7ndccb/the_us_did_not_overthrow_iran_pm_mossadeq_the_cia/",
        "text": "**TL;DR: The US/British operation to overthrow Mossadeq failed in 1953, but three days later the clergy, bazaar merchants, with widening support of the middle and upper classes, overthrew Mossadeq successfully for their own reasons.**\n\nSo this has been a pet peeve of mine for a while. But I really can't blame anyone for this piece of bad history given how consistent it is, and how well it fits into the 'American Cold War narrative'. There are currently plenty of really bad Iranian history posts all across Reddit, including this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7n9502/i_keep_seeing_photos_from_iran_in_the_1950s_where/ds026pe/), which posits that Iran is \"unfree\" because of a [failed] coup attempt in 1953. This is of course a nonsensical order of events, the 1979 Iranian Revolution is so much more complicated, but is almost always summed up as: \"Mossadeq was overthrown in 1953 by the US, so angry Iranians overthrew the Shah and setup an Islamic Republic in 1979\"... suffice it to say, this line of thinking doesn't make sense when put to even a little bit of scrutiny. The Shah's regime was stable after 1953, and his overthrow in 1979 was never inevitable.\n\nBut I am here to put the record straight on the 1953 overthrow of Mossadeq, not the reasons for the 1979 Revolution which would require a much larger post. Specifically I will show that the overthrow of Mossadeq was precipitated by a quickly changing political situation in Iran, rather than the top-down American CIA achievement that it was clearly not but continues to be heralded as.\n\n**Source:**\n\nFor this I'm using Michael Axworthy book, *Revolutionary Iran: A History of the Islamic Republic* (2013). It remains the best and most up to date work by an Iran historian about the various upheavals in 20th century Iranian history. I highly recommend the book as a result. All the quotes here are from his book. \n\n**First Phase (1952-1953):**\n\nMossadeq is in power. During the \"July Crisis\" he faced down the Shah, and was able to choose the Minister of War that he wanted. He began to push for land reform and further nationalization of certain industries which threatened both conservative landowners (who had previously dominated Parliament) and *Bazaari* merchants. He then appointed \"secular-minded and anticlerical ministers\" to Parliament, turning the most senior Shi'ite ayatollah (the *Marja'*), Kashani, against him. What allowed Mossadeq to move with such speed was that he had taken on \"emergency powers\" in the parliament (*majles*), after the July Crisis, and was effectively ruling by decree. Having supported Mossadeq in July, Kashani and his followers began to express doubts about the government actions against the constitution. They also protested against plans to give women the vote and rescind a ban on the sale of alcohol. When Mossadeq asked for an extension of his emergency powers, clerical members of the Majles who supported Kashani left the National Front coalition and setup their own Islamic fraction. \n\nSo at this point in 1953 Mossadeq, who had once had the support of the Bazaari's and Shi'ite *'ulema* (clergy) in a grand 'National Front' coalition, now had lost their support, including that of rich landowners and of course the Shah and his entourage. \n\nAxworthy puts it like this:\n\n&gt;So although a referendum in July 1953 again showed huge support for Mossadeq, there were doubts about the fairness of the poll, and important leaders of the traditional middle class – the clergy and the bazaaris – had gone over to the conservative, monarchist side. (pg. 50)\n\nI think we need to see Mossadeq not as singular trend however, but as part of a larger post-WW2 Middle East trend towards \"secular reforming autocrats\", not as an exception to this. The difference is he came to power through parliament, rather than through military coup like Nasser, Gaddafi, Boumediene etc. But like the latter examples, he ended up ruling 'autocratically' (this being a relative term of course) during his short stay in power. His ultimate failure would be in presuming the public would remain on his side, and that he could rule autocratically without the support of any of the major power players in Iran. Nasser had the army to support him, while Mossadeq's legitimacy was isolated to public support for his emergency powers - a very flimsy base. \n\n**American [Failed] Coup Attempt:**\n\nThis is the story we all know (I will hence keep it brief). Mossadeq threatened British oil, the British cajoled the Americans into helping them overthrow Mossadeq as a result. The British called it \"Operation Boot\" and the Americans called it \"Operation Ajax\". The plan was to eject Mossadeq, and replace him with General Zahedi as Prime Minister.\n\nSo on the night of 15/16 August 1953, Colonel Nasiri of the Imperial Guard led an armoured column to Mossadeq's residence in Tehran, giving him a royal decree (*ferman*) that removed him from office. But the plotters plans had been leaked. Nasiri was intercepted on Mossadeq's doorstep by officers loyal to the elected government, commanded by General Riahi, the Chief of Staff. \n\n&gt;They arrested Nasiri and put him behind bars. In the morning Tehran Radio announced that a coup attempt had been foiled. Mossadeq himself came on air and named the Shah and unspecified foreigners as the instigators. Within minutes of the broadcast, taking only Soraya [Shah's wife], the pilot and one other companion with him, the Shah flew out of the country in a light aircraft, to Baghdad. From there he flew on to Rome. (pg. 53)\n\nThe Iranian ambassador in Rome actually ignored the Shah, showing that loyalty was with the Mossadeq government in Tehran. Reza Shah Pahlavi and his wife contemplated buying a farm in Italy somewhere. \n\nMost importantly: \n\n&gt;Back in Tehran, crowds went onto the streets to demonstrate for Mossadeq, and **Kermit Roosevelt sent a telegram to Washington to break the bad news that his coup attempt had failed.** (pg. 53)\n\n**Immediate Aftermath of the Failed Coup:**\n\nThis is where building a narrative of events gets tricky, and why the myth of CIA overthrow has been so persistent. I will rely heavily on Axworthy as a result. \n\nBut in the immediate aftermath of the failed CIA backed coup attempt, there was massive anti-Shah protests across Iran, with his statue being toppled everywhere. The American ambassador told Mossadeq that the Tudeh Party (Communist party) was growing in strength, and might seize the state. The Shi'ite clerics and Bazaar merchants, alarmed at the possibility of an atheistic communist regime, stepped in to intervene.\n\n&gt;Many if not most of the officers that Roosevelt had been dealing with had been arrested at Mossadeq’s orders, Zahedi himself was in hiding, and the CIA ’s ability to influence events must have been damaged, to say the least. The Imperial Guard had been disarmed (in the pre-coup planning the CIA assessment had been that most police and army units in the capital were loyal to Mossadeq in any case). Once again, Tudeh networks within the armed forces helped Mossadeq to do this effectively. There is evidence that most of the US actors in Tehran had given up the game; **in Washington, Eisenhower’s advisers were telling him that the CIA had failed, and it would now be necessary to ‘snuggle up’ to Mossadeq if the US were to retrieve anything from the situation.** (pg. 54)\n\n**The Real Overthrow of Mossadeq:**\n\n&gt;But the situation, and some loyalties, were shifting. On the afternoon of Monday 17 August, deciding that enough was enough, Mossadeq\ntold Tudeh to back down and authorized the police and army to use force to break up the Tudeh- led demonstrations if necessary. This they did the next day  – leaving the field open for anti-Mossadeq and pro-Shah demonstrations, which followed on 19 August. After their experience on the Tuesday, Tudeh kept their people at home, and a confrontation developed outside Mossadeq’s residence, in which a number of brawny members of bazaar *zur-khaneh* seem to have participated. This turned to violence as some troops arrived, including six Sherman tanks. There was an exchange of fire between these tanks and the soldiers guarding the house. The shooting continued for two hours, with many casualties, and three tanks that had been in position to defend the house were destroyed. Meanwhile, pro-Shah demonstrators took over the radio station and began broadcasting from there. Eventually, with General Riahi telling him the situation was\nhopeless, Mossadeq gave up, announced at about 5PM that the building would no longer be defended and left by a ladder over a back wall. He [Mossadeq] was arrested the following day. Zahedi came out of hiding to take control as the new prime minister, and the Shah flew back to Tehran on 22 August. At the airport a military honour guard turned out to welcome him, but was kept at a distance in case one of the soldiers made an assassination attempt. (pg. 55)\n\nMossadeq had been overthrown three days after the failed CIA attempt. According to Axworthy, the Eisenhower administration was \"dumbfounded\" by this reversal of fortune. But again, this was not because of American CIA operatives, but because of local political actors (the Shi'ite clergy, Bazaari's and others in the conservative upper and middle class).   \n\n**Why does the CIA coup myth persist?:**\n\n&gt;What had happened? Roosevelt and the CIA did their best to take the credit later, claiming the coup as one of their greatest successes against the Soviets in the Cold War. Among other things, they claimed that they passed $ 10,000 to Ayatollah Kashani, to pay mobs to turn out on the streets on 19 August. **But Kashani and other senior clergy did not need money to persuade them to act against Mossadeq, and their influence and connections were quite enough to bring crowds on to the streets without American cash. In fact, Kashani himself had created the conditions for the coup by turning against Mossadeq earlier in the year**. (pg. 55)\n\nIn summation, the Shi'ite clergy was more effective in turning out effective mobilizing action on the streets, than the CIA could ever have been. This was the not the first time the clergy had intervened in secular political life in the 20th century, nor would it be the last time. But it was indeed a rare show of force, of an institution that had traditionally been 'quietest' (aloof of secular politics). This is not the case of all Muslim countries, but in Shi'ite Iran, where the clergy was highly organized, the clergy could be an effective political force, and lever against 'secular oppression' [of their own definition]. So whereas in other Middle East countries, where the Muslim clergy had been co-opted (Saudi Arabia) or coerced (Egypt) by authoritarian leaders, religious inspired terrorism became one answer to perceived (and very real) 'oppression'. In Iran however the clergy was never subdued, and remained highly independent, despite many attempts by the Pahlavi's to thwart them*, and hence remained to be an outlet for 'anger' against any given regime.\n\n\n*In a sense I would 'liken' it to the role of the Catholic Church in 'balancing' the power of Mussolini in Italy. The Church was never subdued by Mussolini, and remained independent. Unlike for instance in neighbouring NSDAP Germany.\n\nThank you for reading, and happy New Year! \n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello badhistorians! This may be a bit of an unorthodox post on here, as instead of discussing a film, internet shitpost, or book, I'll be reviewing a toy for (man)children. \n\nI recently picked up a [Cobi Toys Panzer MkIV kit](https://cobi.pl/en/small-army-ww2/tanks-and-vehicles/pzkpfw-iv-ausf-f1gh,art,9730.html), which can be built as an ausf F1, G, or H. Putting aside my intense WWII nerd joy at discovering an entire line of what are essentially WWII lego sets, I decided to review the model for historical accuracy, because being a pedantic loser who nitpicks tiny details on toy tanks is fun. For reference, the variant that I chose to build is an Ausf H with the side armor skirts removed. Here are some [photos of the kit for reference](https://imgur.com/a/P2m9w).\n\nI'll preface with a brief overview of the Panzer IV and the three variants this kit builds. The Panzer IV (German ordnance inventory designation Sd.Kfz 161) was the workhorse of the German Army for much of WWII. Initially conceived in 1934 by Heinz Guderian as an infantry support tank, it evolved into Nazi Germany's most produced tank, with over 8800 produced in total; in fact it was the only German tank in continuous production during the entire war. It's primary weapon was a 75mm cannon, initially a short-barreled L/24 close support gun, but in mid-1942 that was replaced by a series of long-barreled high-velocity 75mm guns designed to deal with increasing numbers of well-armored Russian tanks, such as the KV1, which proved impervious to the old L/24. 10 production models existed, which are broadly classified as follows: Sd.Kfz 161 (Ausf A-F1, armed with the short L/24 gun), Sd.Kfz 161/1 (Ausf F2-G, armed with the long L/43 gun), and Sd.Kfz 161/2 (Ausf G-J, armed with the longer L/48 gun).\n\nSide note: when I say \"variants\", I am talking about the major versions of the tank itself, not any of it's various spin-offs such as the Jagdpanzer IV, Wirbelwind Flakpanzer, or StuG IV. \n\nThe Ausf F1 was the last of the short 75mm-armed PzIVs. This model first appeared in spring 1941 and featured thicker armor than previous models. Less than 500 were produced. \n\nThe Ausf G was a transitional variant, following the F2 (which was an F1 mounting a long 75mm L/43 gun). It appeared in early 1943 and featured thicker armor as well as brackets on the side hull for mounting spare road wheels and track links as improvised extra armor. \n\nThe Ausf H, appearing later in 1943, is generally considered to be the \"main\" version of the PzIV, equipped with the more powerful 75mm L/48 gun, and is probably the most iconic with it's distinctive side skirt armor plates (known as Schürzen) and spaced turret armor. These were designed to help defeat High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) munitions, causing them to detonate prematurely. The PzIVH remained in service for the rest of the war and saw no further variants aside from the Ausf J, which was a late-war model with some corners cut to help ease production.\n\nNow we'll discuss the model kit. Let's start with the most obvious things.\n\nFirst off, the [commander's hatch is 100% wrong.](https://i.imgur.com/xxEvkCL.jpg?1) All models of Panzer IV from the A to the J, featured a [distinctive raised commander's cupola](https://i.imgur.com/tHX1jPf.jpg?1), offset to the rear left of the turret. The commander's hatch is of particular interest. The single-piece hatch is more or less correct for an [ausf H](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/ef/73/25ef7324983eae553d4be454c35163de.jpg), but incorrect for earlier variants. I haven't been able to find any concrete data, but from what I've gathered the earlier (pre-1943) variants and some H and J variants had two-piece hatches. One suspects the introduction of the single-piece hatch had to do with simplifying production due to late-war material shortages. \n\nAlso of note is the pintle-mounted antiaircraft machinegun. On close inspection, this is definitely an MG34, and the kit designers did a good job modeling the weapon. On the other hand, the mount is completely wrong, and appears to be similar to the [rotating post mounts used on American tanks](https://i.imgur.com/bxoodCZ.jpg?1). German AFVs did not always include pintle-mounted machineguns, in fact only the H and J variants of the Panzer IV typically had one, and even that was not terribly common. After looking around I've only seen one or two [photos](http://www.geocities.ws/Pentagon/Quarters/4635/tanks/pz4/pz4h.jpg) depicting the AAMG. Another problem with the AAMG in this kit is that it appears to be feeding from a side-mounted box magazine, when the MG-34 was in fact [belt-fed from a pouch](http://www.ww2incolor.com/d/50451-4/ww2+mg34t).\n\nOther things missing from the turret (which in general seems to be somewhat too small) are the rectangular escape hatches on the side, and the large T-shaped stowage basket mounted to the back, both of which can be seen [here](https://padresteve.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/pz-iv-g.jpg). Another pedantic nitpick is the placement of the radio antenna, which the kit places on the rear hull for all variants, when in reality the antenna was located at the front-right hull next to the turret on all models prior to the H, as shown [here](http://wiki.gcdn.co/images/thumb/5/5d/PzKpfw_IV_Ausf_C.jpg/288px-PzKpfw_IV_Ausf_C.jpg). The side-mounted extra road wheels are just kind of chilling on the side of the hull rather than secured in a [bracket](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Medium_Tanks/Panzer-IV/panzer_IV_Ausf-H_35pzr4pzd.png). There is also a lack of accessories such as jerry cans and tool boxes, though there are a shovel and a comically large wrench, which the kit places on the front hull. I moved them to the rear hull, which seems to be a more common location for tool stowage. Finally, the rear drive wheel is a large solid wheel with no teeth, as opposed to a thin spoked sprocket, and the tracks in general are far too wide, much closer to those of a Panther or Tiger.\n\nLet's move on to the camouflage scheme, which on this model appears to be large angular sections of tan and olive drab, almost certainly representing dunkel gelb and oliv grun. While the classic color people think of when they think of German tanks is [panzer grey](http://hyperscale.com/images/DSC_3073.jpg) (dunkel grau), that base ceased use in early 1943, due to it's impracticality on the North African and Russian fronts. Army Memorandum No. 181, issued in February of 1943, standardized the overall basic color for all vehicles and equipment to a sand-yellow color, known as dunkel gelb. All newly-produced vehicles came from the factory in this color, with orders for units already in the field to re-paint when possible, though not all units were able to do so, leaving some vehicles in the original dunkel grau. In addition to mandating the dunkel gelb base paint, the memorandum also authorized the use of oliv grun (olive green) and rotbraun (red-brown) paint over the dunkel gelb as camouflage, the patterns of which were left in the hands of field commanders. In order to facilitate this, each vehicle was issued with a can of each of the new paint colors, though late-war supply and logistics problems meant not every vehicle got these. Moreover, the method in which the paint was diluted and applied could affect the tone of the color, causing further color variations. Because of this system, and the aforementioned logistics situation, there are few \"standard\" camouflage patterns for German AFVs post-1942, though some more elite formations such as the SS, and the tank destroyer formations with their famed [\"ambush pattern\"](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/5b/20/2f5b20fdb2ded789d68cb0084f7da695.png), seem to have made some attempt at uniformity within their own units. Long story short, you could probably fill an entire book discussing the different varieties of German vehicle camouflage and the reasons behind them.\n\nGoing back to the model kit, the large angular patches of oliv grun, while not by any means outside of the realm of possibility, does seem fairly atypical for German camouflage, which more often than not made use of [smaller rounded blotches](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Medium_Tanks/Panzer-IV/panzer_IV_Ausf-H_Kursk_HD.jpg), or [vertical wavy lines](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Medium_Tanks/Panzer-IV/Pzd-H_PzLehr_3c_1pzd.png). I'll give it a pass given the huge variety of pattern types used by the Germans, coupled with how much of a pain it is to produce non-angular camouflague patterns on a model made from monochrome blocks.\n\nNext up are the markings. The model features a typical three-digit tactical number on each side of the turret, in this case \"634\". Germany used this three-digit system, in which the first digit was the Company number, the second was the platoon, and the third was the vehicle. Thus my tank is the fourth vehicle, third platoon, sixth company, which is appropriate. On the flip side, the large multi-part stenciled digits are probably wrong. I can't be sure, because this is some fairly epic-level nitpicking, but I have found no evidence of that particular stenciled font being used by the Germans. Additionally, solid white was largely phased out by mid-war because they tended to stand out too much, giving Allied gunners a good aiming point. Most commonly, you would see red with a white outline, a white outline only, or black with a white outline. The number style depicted on the model, while possible, is not particularly probable. Behind the tactical number, we have a [unit marking](https://imgur.com/PfGSrT1) indicating that this tank belonged to the [2nd Panzer Battalion of Panzer Lehr Regiment 130](http://www.rtvmodeler.com/NormandyInsignias/ins-08.jpg), one of the units of the elite Panzer Lehr Division. Upon further google-fu, I found an image of this exact tank (Panzer 634, II. Panzer Abteilung, Panzer Lehr Regiment 130) [knocked the fuck out in Villers-Bocage in June 1944](http://www.axishistory.com/images/stories/p/panzer4-pzlehr-france1944.jpg). Interestingly, neither the F1 or the G variants this kit can build have any unit markings, which is some fairly nice attention to detail, ensuring that the H model depicted is an actual tank and not just made-up.\n\nLastly, let's discuss [the figures](https://i.imgur.com/dwZBd4n.jpg). The kit includes a tank commander and a foot soldier with Heer helmet insignia. Our foot soldier, who appears to be in the throes of intense bloodlust, is wearing the classic grey-green M43 uniform, with the shoulderboards of a Soldat (private) in the Infantry. However, his shoulderboards and collar tabs are black instead of the typical bottle green, which either makes him a combat engineer or a member of the Waffen-SS, I'm having a hard time figuring out which. The psychotic expressions says SS but the helmet markings say Wehrmacht. The tanker, meanwhile, is wearing the characteristic all-black panzer wrap and trousers. He is a badass, wearing a Panzerkampfabzeichen (panzer badge), which indicates he has taken part in at least 3 armored assaults, been wounded in an assault, or been decorated for bravery during an assault. Given that he is also wearing an Iron Cross, I'm going to assume the third option. His collar tabs and shoulder boards however, are a small disaster. His collar tabs indicate he is an [SS-Oberscharfuhrer](http://www.2ndss.net/images/Rankstructure.jpg), which is the SS meme version of a Feldwebel, or Senior Squad Leader, begging the question of what he doing commanding a tank in a Wehrmacht panzer division. Further confusing things, he is wearing the silver rank pips on both sides of his collar, instead of the rank on one side and the SS lightning bolts on the other, and his shoulder boards are bare, indicating a lower-enlisted (non-NCO) SS member. He has also apparently decided to remove all the insignia from his garrison cap, which by this point should have been phased out in favor of the M43 field cap anyway. Whoever this man is, he clearly ran out of fucks to give long ago, a theory reinforced by a prominent [Schmiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dueling_scar) on his face.\n\nOverall, this is a good kit, with good attention to detail on some features but some dropped balls on a few others. I appreciate the effort to depict authentic unit markings and the medals on the commander's uniform, as well as the provisions to build the kit as one of three variants. The only super glaring issues that stand out on cursory inspection are the commander's cupola and the strangely wide tracks.\n\nAnyway, that's about all I have to say on the topic. I hope you all enjoyed reading this epic nitpick festival directed at a toy tank. \n\nMain Sources Used:\n\n*D-Day To Berlin: Armour Camouflage and Markings of the United States, British, and German Armies, June 1944 to May 1945* by Terrence Wise\n\nhttp://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-iv.htm\n\nhttp://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Panzer_IV.php\n\nAdditional Sources:\n\nwww.feldgrau.com\n\nwww.worldwarphotos.info\n\nwww.wikipedia.org",

Aristotle took the future Alexander the Great under his wing and thought he had imbued him with the highest ideals of Greece’s Golden Age, along with a healthy dose of hatred for Greece’s perennial foe, the mighty Persian Empire. While Alexander did acquire a thin veneer of what would come to be known as Hellenistic culture, he remained a brutal soldier-conqueror at heart. And the more he conquered, the more tyrannical he became. By the time he had overrun the entire Persian Empire he decided that, like his Persian predecessors, he would set himself up as an omnipotent god-king. Aristotle gradually realized that, far from shaping a Platonic philosopher-king, he had created an imperial Frankenstein fashioned out of supposedly enlightened philosophical body parts but driven by a megalomaniac, barbarian brain.\n\nThe Shahanshah of Persia did not worship himself. They were Zoroastrians, which is a real religion [that still exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsi). To my knowledge, Alexander the Great didn't worship himself either. Many Greeks [did mistake the](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/proskynesis/?) traditional Persian gesture of proskynesis (bowing to a superior) as worship, so that (or 300) is probably where that mistake came from. Alexander apparently adopted this practice, but that doesn't mean he was setting himself up as a god.",

        "text": "What you have just read was said by Fernando Conde Torrens, a Spanish engineer who, according to him, spent 24 years doing research, which can be found in his book, \"Año 303. Inventan el Cristianismo\" (\"Year 303. Christianity is Invented\" in Spanish). He learnt Greek, Hebrew and Latin and analysed books on ancient Christianity and arrived to a conclusion: Christianity was invented between the years 303 and 313 by Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea by order of Constantine and Jesus never existed.\n\n&gt;Jesus Christ (...) is as real as Don Quixote, Superman or Luke Skywalker, he is a fictional character.\n\nMr. Conde, who has no degrees in history, claims that degrees and universities are not important, that what matters is if what he found is true or not. Hispanic media, which is VERY sensationalist, said that Conde [dismantled 2000 years of history with his book](https://ultimahora.es/noticias/cultura/2016/10/06/224142/conde-torrens-desmantela-000-anos-cristianismo-ano-303-inventan-cristianismo.html), though we all know that books like this one have been around for quite a while.\n\n[Here](http://www.naiz.eus/es/hemeroteca/gara/editions/2016-08-07/hemeroteca_articles/las-pruebas-sobre-la-falsedad-del-cristianismo-ya-son-irrefutables), he claims that the proofs he offers are irrefutable. One of those proofs is that he found the acrostic SIMON, which can be found in every chapter of the gospel of Mark, the gospel of John, in the Epistle of James, the three Epistles of John and in several other \"fake Christian documents\". The word SIMON means \"humbug\".\n\nOf course, he says that there were no Christians before the IV century, that the Testimonium Flavianum and other texts that mention Jesus or Christians are forgeries and, as I said before, Jesus never existed. He goes as far as saying that the Early Church Fathers (Justin Martyr, Origen and the others) never existed, they were invented by Lactantius and Eusebius in all the years they were active.\n\nSo far, no theologian, pastor or priest has responded to Fernando Conde Torrens. The only response I've found was written by Dr. Antonio Piñero, from the University of Madrid. He is an agnostic, so he does not have any religious bias.\n\nDr. Piñero had previously said that he wouldn't waste his time with Mr. Conde's book, so he (Conde), who responds to anyone who disagrees with him (much like Richard Carrier), got angry and asked Piñero for an apology. Here is Dr. Piñero's response, which can summarised as this:\n\n&gt;Inventing Christianity is absolutely impossible, because it took, at least, 420 years to be constituted. If you have read the New Testament in Greek, you will realise that it is impossible that it is a product from the year 303. So, a book that defends a hypothesis like that one does not deserve to be read. It is simply losing time when there are so many things to read.\n\n&gt;(...) I don't have any trouble to accept that Christianity was invented in the year 303, if the hypothesis that sustains such assertion is reasonable and explains the data. And I will mention just one: We have papyrus, from the New Testament, dated by atheist scientists, (...) which contain the New Testament around the year 200!!! (...)\n\n&gt;Mr. Fernando Conde Torrens hypothesis is absolutely impossible and I won't waste my time in reading his book.\n\nAlthough this response was quite enough (at least for me), Mr. Conde said that Papyrus P52 has not been dated using absolute methods and that the only time people dated it the results said that it was from between the years 240 and 320 (not the year 150, as scholars say), so it perfectly could have been written in the IV century.\n\nI contacted Dr. Piñero myself about this and, so far, he has not answered my email. I also contacted Christian New Testament scholar Michael Licona, but he has not answered yet. So, I decided to contact someone who answers his readers: Tim O'Neill, from [History For Atheists](https://historyforatheists.com/). He told me he has not heard about Mr. Conde, so I shared some information with him some hours ago. I'm still waiting for his answer.\n\nYesterday, I came across a forum where a user named Aletheia clashed with Conde and his fanboys (who behave in a similar way to Richard Carrier's fanboys), trying to explain them that the whole book was wrong, because Mr. Conde ignored a quote from Suetonius, which mentions Christians being taken to trial by Nero. Conde and several others tried several things to avoid being refuted. The engineer made historian did the same thing John Loftus does when he is cornered, that is, saying \"Read my book, you ignorant fool\".\n\n*NOTE: All the information I found about Fernando Conde Torrens and his book is in Spanish, so you will need Google Translate if you don't know a word of Spanish.*",

The story is set during the French and Indian War, where the British and their native allies defeated the French and their native allies in North America, essentially kicking the French off the continent for good. The game has three separate maps players can explore: The [North Atlantic](https://i.imgur.com/9P23qL2.jpg) (a somewhat downsized version of [the entire Gulf of St. Lawrence](http://fisherkingseafoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TheGulf.png)), the Appalachian River Valley, and New York City. \n\n**I’ll let you know I am not an expert so if there are any mistakes you see in my analysis I am happy to read any corrections.**\n\n**Ok, let’s take a look at the *somewhat* better parts of the uniforms of the [infantry](https://i.imgur.com/tkblx1Y.jpg) in the game, the lowest skilled enemy types.**\n\nThe French soldiers in the game are alright, they got blue cuffs with gold/yellow buttons, their coats are relatively white, as well as their belts, and their hats are black and lined with yellow. Here are some examples of F&amp;I War French soldiers, such as [these reenactors](http://www.reenactorforum.waszmann.de/public_html/yabbfiles/Attachments/royal_comtois.jpg), as well as [this illustration](http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/images/7/74/French_Infantry_Uniform.jpg). \n\nWhat I don’t understand is why the hell did the game designers decided to give them fucking *bicorn* hats and *epaulettes.* Anyways, they wear blue facings, which was virtually unseen across any French infantrymen in N. America (they wore simpler coats like in the images I linked above). They wear cross belts, which I’ve never seen in any other depictions of F&amp;I war French soldiers. It might be surprising that the French infantry (to some degree) wore blue breeches as seen on the in-game renders, we can see an example from [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jKaFvaG.jpg) from PBS’s *The War That Made America* which had decent uniforms the reenactors wore. \n\nThe in-game British infantry soldiers are a *little bit* better. They wear actual tricorn hats (but are not laced with any gold or silver coloring), they wear white belts (though British soldiers would’ve also worn light-brown belts). The in-game soldiers are wearing black gaiters and red breeches, something that was not uncommon. I’ll let you know, [these are 18th century gaiters](https://i.imgur.com/x0XUGBK.jpg?1). The facings on their coats are lime-green/yellow, but the cuffs aren’t the same color (facings and cuffs pretty much had to be the same color most of the time on 18th century military uniforms). Judging by all of this I’m assuming the renderings have been inspired by privates of the 44th Regiment of the foot, which participated in the Battle of the Monongahela in July 1755, the Battle of Carillon in July 1758, and the Battle of Fort Niagara in July 1759. All these battles were fought in July...coincidence? I think not. Anyways, here are some reenactors of the 44th, [here](https://i.imgur.com/2w3Zl9d.jpg) and [here](http://www.44theast-essex.com/wpimages/wp90d6af45_05_06.jpg). As we can see, the in-game renders look pretty similar to these reenactor outfits.\n\nThe one thing that stands out to me that seems anachronistic for the time period are the [shoulder “wings”](https://i.imgur.com/99mzEWH.jpg?1). These wouldn’t be worn by the British army in North America until the [Grenadier](https://i.imgur.com/orAO2Ea.jpg?1) and [Light infantry](https://i.imgur.com/fmgFMZP.jpg?1) companies started wearing them during the American Revolution.\n\n**Next, we’re gonna look at the so-called [“agiles](https://i.imgur.com/8ePhXuY.jpg)”**; or “officers” as these renders have been coined as “officers” in previous game titles like *Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag* (also when boarding enemy ships sometimes the objective is to *kill the officers* which are always these guys).\n\nLet’s take a look at the French one: I mean, at least they wear gorgets, crescent-shaped metal plates signifying the wearer is an officer and that he is on duty. Other than that, real-life officers would’ve worn white coats and tricorn hats, not have belts slung over their shoulders, and the *shoe buckle and strap **over** the gaiters* look questionable. An officer’s main melee weapons would’ve been a pike and/or small sword, NOT a goddamn knife as seen in the in-game render. [Here is an illustration of a French officer of *Le régiment de Languedoc* in full dress, 1758.](https://i.imgur.com/Yo5mcRm.jpg)\n\nNow let’s move on to the British one, where everything here is wrong: there’s no gorget, no tricorn hat, there’s some random black leather surrounding his collar and shoulders, the facings are the same color as the coat, the cuffs are brown and funny looking, and he’s wearing a shoulder-slung belt. The same melee weapon problems are also present. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/XuP5NIj.jpg?1) is a depiction of what a British senior officer would look like, for example. \n\n**Next, we’re gonna look at the [gunners](https://i.imgur.com/HxpEVmE.jpg)**, which for some reason they’re called that in-game, although they look like grenadiers. Grenadiers were the elite units of infantry battalions, conspicuous by their height which was augmented by the wearing of mitre caps (which is correctly seen on the British render). You can see here in Edward Penny's [The Death of General Wolfe](https://static.artuk.org/w800h800/ASH/ASH_ASHM_WA1845_38.jpg), painted in 1764 and depicting James Wolfe's death at Quebec in 1759 that the grenadier uniform looks somewhat similar to the in-game “gunners”.\n\nOther than that, I have yet to see any depictions of black cuffs, brown-black facings, and silver-plated bearskin mitre caps on 1750’s French grenadiers, but they’re pretty hard to find because they never actually wore any of that. The British “gunner” (or in this case, a grenadier by the looks of it) is a bit better, the mitre cap is pretty much on point, the facings are yellow, but for some reason the cuffs are black, and there are no turnbacks on the bottom ends of coat, instead they look like they’re lined with thick black leather. British grenadiers’ shoulder-slung belts would have actually been *yellow* or beige...or beige/yellow --however you see it!---as depicted in this illustration of the [31st, 32nd, and 33rd](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a1/e9/75/a1e975c9d6853d7d0f0c22098eea6278.jpg), and this depiction of grenadiers of the [34th, 35th and 36th regiments](http://www.militaryheritage.com/images/34th35th36thregiments.jpg) and the first few images of reenactors when you Google search [british grenadier french and indian war](https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=637&amp;ei=FfwRWuCCO8uWjwPVtrP4BQ&amp;q=british+grenadier+french+and+indian+war&amp;oq=brit&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.35i39k1l2j0l8.575.1020.0.2246.5.5.0.0.0.0.163.510.0j4.4.0....0...1.1.64.img..1.4.509.0...0.grWakEtZh7Q#imgrc=_). Swords would have also been equipped, as seen in the previous illustrations. \n\n**We’re gonna skim through [these bad boys](https://i.imgur.com/iMIUtLn.jpg) pretty quickly** because as badass as they look, they also look ridiculous. They are referred to as *bounty hunters* in-game, and from what I know, the British nor the French did not have any designated, specialized “bounty hunter” units throughout the war IRL. I’m getting some dragoon or light-infantry vibes by the looks of their helmets, which look anachronistic for the time period. \n\n**The British and French [“brutes”](https://i.imgur.com/ZVMajDb.jpg)** also have a similar (if not, the same) situation with the gunners I previously analyzed. For example, in *Assassin’s Creed III* the “grenadier” enemy archetypes were similar, as both were large, brutish soldiers that carried axes, so I’m assuming these guys are also supposed to be grenadiers, but they definitely are not as they also carry axes in-game. The only army units I know of that carried axes extensively were pioneers and sappers, but I couldn’t find anything about them operating the F&amp;I war. \n\n**We now have our [captains](https://i.imgur.com/RQ1ILHg.jpg ) to take a look at** and they look astonishingly inaccurate! What I can say is that a French captain definitely would not wear a slouch hat where one side of the brim was turned up and pinned to the side of the hat. Also, Ubisoft’s obsession with shoulder “semi-capes” is back again (but that’s because I’ve heard that apparently shoulder movements are hard to animate in video games, so they cover them up with armor and semi-capes). Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any depictions of French or British army *captains* specifically so I’ll show you guys what uniforms of higher ranks would’ve looked like. \n\n[This painting](http://www.lordnelsons.com/gallery/frontier/griffing/images/griffing_03l.jpg) by Robert Griffing (who has other fantastic paintings) depicts General Louis-Joseph Marquis de Montcalm (in the middle) as he meets with Indian allies near the French fortress *Carillon* on the shore of Lake Champlain. \n\nFor a British high-ranking officer, the only context of [this reenactor photo](https://i.imgur.com/cqjftMt.jpg) I could find is from an article from [mountvernon.org](http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/french-indian-war/washington-and-the-french-indian-war/#_ftnref22), and I’m assuming the person is dressed up as lieutenant-colonel, a rank George Washington was promoted to in 1754. I’m just going to further assume that the photo taken was a reenactment of one of the events of George Washington’s military career at the start of the F&amp;I war. Here, the yellow facings are similar to the in-game render, but that’s about it. \n\n**Let this sink in for a moment: all the renders you have seen are also on the naval ships you can fight, board, and capture.**\n\nFor the lowest-ranking enemies in the game (i.e. infantry) they were regular sailors on the ship, as they were the most numerous. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything for what French sailors would have specifically worn, but I’m assuming they would have worn clothing that were similar to British sailors, which we do have a lot of information on. \n\nThe clothes that British sailors wore would have been a variety of colors: jackets were red (though not redcoat red), blue and brown; the cuffs on jackets would have been slit cuffed, or [“slashed” (or, mariner) styled](https://i.imgur.com/HB9XFqb.jpg) which are, for some reason, of absence *anywhere* on the in-game enemy archetypes; breeches would have been brown, red (which we see in-game), white, and blue; petticoat trousers were commonly worn. They would have worn cocked (tricorn) and round hats, and also knit caps (or monmouth caps). Neckcloths would have been red, gray, blue, yellow, or white. And shoes would’ve been “oval-toed” or “pointed-toe” styled with oval or rectangular buckles worn over white stocks. \n\nFor the British “gunners”, I’m assuming they are, at least, *marines* on the ships. In this illustration titled [“British Resentment or the French fairly Coopt at Louisbourg”, Louis Pierre Boitard, 1755](https://i.imgur.com/cLrSdzA.jpg). At the bottom right there is [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/1EsY2qn.jpg?1), who I’m assuming is a British marine as many of them participated in the Siege of Louisbourg that would take place in 1758. This one is very different from the in-game render: he has blue cuffs and facings, a black cocked hat and cockade, a white shoulder-slung belt and waist belt, a sword (which looks more like a smallsword than a cutlass) and white stockings/gaiters. \n\nFor the French “gunners”, take a look at the uniforms of the [Compagnies Franches de la Marine](http://www.troupesdemarine.org/traditions/uniforme/pgs/un000017.htm), which were units attached to the French Royal Navy (French: marine royale) bound to serve both on land and sea. \n\nFor French officers, on [the left](http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/images/1/15/French_Navy_Officer_Small_Uniform.jpg) is what’s considered a ‘small uniform’ of an ensign that would be on a ship of the line, circa 1764.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find anything on British (commissioned) officers.\n\nFor our captains, [here](https://i.imgur.com/Znf7Rl9.jpg) is a painting of Captain Edward Knowles from 1762. Here, his coat is blue (of course it is), with mariner’s cuffs and gold trimmings, white facings, and a black cocked hat and cockade. \n\n[Here](http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/images/4/4c/French_Navy_Captain_Great_Uniform.jpg ) is a depiction of a French naval captain in a ‘great uniform’ circa. 1764. Now that is a year after the war ended, but it’s still pretty close. \n\nThe “brutes” would have just been common sailors wielding axes, nothing special.\n\n**Now let’s look at the ships! Specifically the British ships first**\n\nFor the British ships, the in-game models in *Rogue* are exact copies of those from Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. So to give you an idea of how they look like: a [gunboat](https://i.imgur.com/SSA8vvY.jpg), [schooner](https://i.imgur.com/XhZ2M6n.jpg), [frigate](https://i.imgur.com/o9Z040p.jpg), [brig and man o’ war](https://i.imgur.com/BC2v3eQ.jpg).\n\nRight off the bat, I can tell you that the St. George’s cross was never emblazoned onto the sails of Royal Navy ships. Instead, they would have been the regular, boring, plain white. (but because the game pretty much requires players to be able to spot ships from a distance, the ships have to be conspicuous, so I can’t really blame them).\n\nAlso, notice the generic yellow-dark blue bands streaking across the hulls of the ships? That is what’s considered [the Nelson Chequer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Chequer), (though black IRL instead of dark blue in-game, but pretty close) which--hence the name--was a color scheme adopted by vessels of the Royal Navy during the time of Admiral Horatio Nelson...decades after the game takes place. We can see it here on [HMS *Victory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Chequer#/media/File:Victory_starboard.JPG) and [this frigate on the bottom left](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Attack_on_Fort_Oswego_%28May_1914%29%2C_War_of_1812.jpg) in an illustration of the 1814 Battle of Fort Oswego. \n\nIf you want to see the actual color schemes of British warships in from the 1750s, take a look at the beautiful paintings of [John Cleveley the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleveley_the_Elder) (1712 – 1777). Listed below are some paintings of British warships that were made *in* the 1750s:\n\n* [naval brigantine, 1752](http://archive.attaches.forums.a0z.ru/cc/4c/cc4cec182654f75dc2652690dda46f79.jpg)\n\n* [28-gun 6th rate frigate, 1758](http://collections.rmg.co.uk/mediaLib/483/media-483247/large.jpg)\n\n* [3rd rate ship, 1752](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ldOHn7FlXCc/WCsvDL_2wXI/AAAAAAAAITU/vBo8KwkA0lgpEsvC3vuCz2A4CzHusmIowCLcB/s1600/Buckingham%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bstocks%2Bat%2BDeptford%252C%2BJohn%2BCleveley%2Bthe%2BElder%252C%2B1752%252C%2BNational%2BMaritime%2BMuseum.jpg)\n\n* [100-gun 1st rate ship of the line](http://img.anews.com/media/gallery/67685974/602195219.jpg)\n\nAs seen, they have a more orange hue to them. They also have white-bottomed hulls. Most of them also have both black and dark blue bands. \n\nNow, I don’t know why the developers termed the strongest ships in the game as *Man o’ Wars* (or, Men o’ war) because the term “man o’ war” [was actually the general term to refer to *any* warship in the Royal Navy in the 18th century](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5aetlh/what_was_the_difference_between_a_galleon_man_o/d9gf2o5/). Ships of this size would actually be termed as “ships of the line” (with 4th to 1st rates being classified as so) \n\nI can’t find the entry from the Assassin’s Creed wiki but I remember that it said that the in-game Man o’ War models are modeled after HMS *Victory*. [Here is a plan of the ship, as built in 1765](https://i.imgur.com/3njsMQE.png?1). Now, the game ends in 1760, just 5 years before *Victory* was built, so the in-game models are pretty much on point, other than the tremendous amount of bow cannons (for which *Victory* only had like, around 2 or 4).\n\n**The French ships**\n\nThe in-game models ([such as this frigate, brigs, and schooners](https://i.imgur.com/QD8O1Ul.png), [and this man o’ war 2](https://i.imgur.com/SnrSymf.jpg)) do look pretty. Their hulls are as blue as the sky and their sails are light blue, adorned with dark blue fleurs-de-lis...as expected this is all inaccurate (but, as I say again, because the game pretty much requires players to be able to spot ships from a distance, the ships have to be conspicuous, so I can’t really blame them).\n\nHonestly, sources are too scarce for any contemporary paintings of French ships from the 1750s (there is literally nothing). But if you want to see *anything at all* I can give you [this model of a French ship of the line](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Sans_Pareil-IMG_8602.jpg). For some context behind it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-Pareil-class_ship_of_the_line):\n\n&gt; The Sans-Pareil was a project to build a series of ships taking into account new improvements in ship design. The name was suggested twice to Louis XV; in 1751, the king preferred Océan, and in 1757, Royal-Louis, Médiateur, Majestueux, and Indomptable. Only Royal-Louis was actually built; due to the huge costs of construction, the three others were replaced with smaller-sized ships of the line.\n\n&gt; The Sans-Pareil only existed as a 1/30th model which is now kept at the Musée de la Marine in Paris. It is very likely to offer only very minor differences to what the Royal-Louis was like when she was launched in Brest in 1759\n\n&gt; The figurehead featured a lion. The ornaments of the aft were simplified, integrating the overall lines and structure of the ship.\n\nAlso from that Wikipedia link, there is [this source](http://mnm.webmuseo.com/ws/musee-national-marine/app/collection/record/8949) showing many more photos of this beautiful ship. According to this one, it was created in 1760.\n\nAlso as a side note, I'm kind of disappointed that there weren't any 74-gun ships in the game. Though the ships were copy+paste from the previous title, it would have been nice to add them. As IRL the British and French navies had many 74's during the Seven Years War. \n\nSo there you have it folks, I’m exhausted and blew all my steam out. Happy holidays everyone. \n\n\n",

        "author": "puabie",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7lcapq/twitter_history_and_hot_takes_why_christianity/",
        "text": "Yesterday morning, @JaleelSpeaQs saw a tweet by @theblackdetour about whether Christianity has made poor black people more okay with being second-class citizens. It's a worthy question: does belief in a perfect afterlife make people ignore their surroundings? Does it make the religious more likely to accept being oppressed? Huh. The tweet read: \"Has Christianity railroaded black people into believing it's okay to suffer on Earth because one day you will make it heaven?\"\n\nBut Jaleel had a different take. [He quoted the tweet and added his own interpretation](https://twitter.com/JaleelSpeaQs/status/943481900278206465), this time with stronger language, weaker logic and more all-caps:\n\n\"This is literally the ONLY reason that Christianity was introduced to black ppl in America. For that EXACT purpose.\"\n\nSince we all know that white people in the 17th century were all on the same page when it comes to slavery, it seems Jaleel has his facts straight. After all, the Bible sends a pretty clear message when it comes to enslaving other human beings, and everyone interpreted it the same way... wait a minute. That doesn't sound right.\n\nI did a little research.\n\nThe first source I found seemed to mostly confirm Jaleel's belief that Christianity was used by some people to justify slavery. Robert Croskery [writes in his thesis](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1925&amp;context=etd): \"Although many abolitionists believed Southern acceptance or advocacy of slavery undermined Southern morality, Confederate generals held opposing views. Many believed that since God had created slavery, He alone was responsible for eliminating it. Their duty was to practice Christian morality and obey God’s laws.\" I was interested in the first sentence, though. It seems Christians from outside the South thought their religion went *against* slavery. We were all taught about abolitionists in school - surely some of these individuals wanted to convert slaves and freemen to Christianity because they actually believed it and not because they wanted to subjugate them. Or maybe the abolitionists were really in on the secret White Plot, too. Who knows. Score: Jaleel 0, /u/Puabie 1.\n\nLet's check out a different source. Mark Noll writes in his book [*A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada*](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=christianity+to+slaves+america&amp;ots=2S-Rvl3MIh&amp;sig=rve5a243Tn3YkVP_XbTt7uNdj0k#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false): \"One of the strategies used by those who were concerned about offering Chirstianity to the slaves was the argument that Christian instruction made slaves better workers ... Some slave owners heeded this message, but others were not convinced, especially when **Christianity among slaves came to be associated with revolt**. Such was the case in South Carolina in 1725, when a group of slaves, inspired it seems by apocalyptic messages in the Bible, rose up against their masters.\" He also writes later: \"Blacks who attempted t form freed slaves into effective churches encountered obstructions from both Northern and Southern whites.\" Emphasis mine.\n\nInteresting - it seems that Christianity had a lot of unexpected effects on black Americans. Some whites tried to convert slaves but were surprised when the slaves used Christianity as a means of hope. Others were making up reasons to convert slaves and using them to convince slaveowners to introduce their religion to slaves. Does this negate the possibility that whites had a unified plan to hold black people back with Christianity? Probably, but I'm a nerd with nothing to do, so let's keep this train rolling. Jaleel 0, /u/Puabie 2.\n\n[In an address to slaves](http://www.ksassessments.org/sites/default/files/HGSS_Preview_Texts/Grade_8/Garnet's%20Call%20to%20Rebellion.pdf), Henry Highland Garnett, a black abolitionist, argued that any slaveowner keeping slaves *from* being converted was betraying God. \"If a band of heathen men should attempt to enslave a race of Christians, and to place their children under the influence of some false religion, surely, heaven would frown upon the men who would not resist such aggression, even to death. If, on the other hand, a band of Christians should attempt to enslave a race of heathen men and to entail slavery upon them, and to keep them in heathenism in the midst of Christianity, the God of heaven would smile upon every effort which the injured might make to disenthral themselves.\" Make it /u/Puabie 3.\n\nIt is not his view I am interested in. The fact that he, a black man, held this view in the latter half of the 19th century, when many voices still supported the institution of slavery, interests me.\n\nBut I haven't told you everything. Jaleel actually replied to himself and continued his rant in a thread. He later says that \"Christianity has been used as a weapon of oppression on Black people,\" which is true enough. In my first source, Robert Croskery says as much in the abstract: \"Confederate generals possessed religious convictions about slavery that enabled them to support or ignore the peculiar institution. Their understanding of Providence gave them confidence in the power of their armies, and in their petitions to God. Many Confederate generals performed their duty not only through a sense of civil obligation but also religious mission.\" Score: Jaleel 1, /u/Puabie 3.\n\nJaleel, not satisfied with scoring one point in a four-point match, goes on. But he stumbles. He says that Christianity itself is not wrong - which is an interesting departure from the original tweet, which was based on the idea that belief in an afterlife is the problem - and claims that the real problem was in how it was delivered to black Americans. Specifically, \"By giving enslaved black ppl Jesus, but not Black Jesus. By giving them the Bible but an abridged version that focuses on obeying your master &amp; 'suffer now, go to heaven later.'\"\n\nLet's not get into whether Jesus was black. He was dark and probably had curly black hair, but that's all we know. We certainly don't have any evidence that he looked like a black African, though, which sounds right since he was born in the Middle East, the home of Arabs, Kurds, Hebrews and Persians.\n\nMy main issue with Jaleel's claims are how absolutely *certain* he is and his total lack of specificity. He says in another tweet that Christianity \"has evolved ... to keep ppl oppressed, and the main method is by making ppl work to enjoy heaven after death instead of in life.\" But who is using this method? Why? He depends so much on passive sentences - this was done, Christianity was introduced, etc. - because he does not know who did those things. He doesn't care. He has a narrative backed up by a single screenshot of a page from Frederick Douglass's autobiography that doesn't even support his argument. \n\nI did not make this post to argue on the side of Christianity. Nor did I make it to argue on the side of white people. I gave a number of sources discussing Christianity as a tool of oppression and a way to rationalize slavery. Why? Because it was. But I also gave sources discussing Christianity as a tool of survival and revolution. Why? Because it was. I cited sources discussing Christianity as a neutral thing, used in different ways by different people for very different reasons. Why? Well, you know why.\n\nBecause religion is a product of human experience. And anything that comes from human experience is malleable and adaptable and forever changing. It can be used as both a foundation upon which to build a society and also a weapon with which to destroy lives. Christianity is - and has been, over and over again - both. Christianity justified slavery, burned dozens of Salem women alive and murdered thousands of innocent people in the Crusades. It also inspired slaves to rise up against their masters. What gives?\n\nTwitter cannot be the way the world learns. Even with 280 characters, it cannot be the sole source of truth. For anyone. That's why it angered me when his tweets got thousands of retweets - and certainly hundreds of thousands of views - portraying history as an endless battle between black and white, good and bad, rather than the uncomfortable, hopelessly complex reality. His harsh, uncompromising words might have caused hundreds of people to go about their days thinking about the world through the lens of us vs. them. I'm not about that.\n\nHave a great Christmas, Festivus and Kwanzaa, everyone. How was Hannukah, by the way?",

        "text": "This film irks me. As a movie I love it. The visuals, the costuming, the performances, the tragic symbolism of Japan literally slaughtering its own heritage and traditions with machineguns at the end, it's all absolutely wonderful. Too bad it's about as true to history as Braveheart. I've browsed around on here a bit and haven't seen any particularly detailed breakdowns of what the film gets wrong, and so have taken it upon myself to write out a lovely pedantic rant for your enjoyment. \n\nDISCLAIMER: this is my first ever attempt at an R5 so please be gentle. Also, most of my study is military-focused, so if you were hoping to see a rant about how Saigo's village isn't an accurate representation of life under samurai rule, look elsewhere (though I suspect that is probably the case).\n\nEarly in the film, depressed alcoholic Tom Cruise arrives in Tokyo as part of a group of US Army advisors helping train the new Imperial Army. First things first, the Japanese didn't use American advisors, they used European ones. The film also portrays the Imperial Army as being a rabble of conscripts with no training armed with 1861 Springfield rifled muskets. By the time the film is set (the 1870s), the Japanese had been using guns for over 300 years, and the young Imperial Army was already plenty experienced from the earlier Meiji Restoration and Boshin War. They were armed primarily with (at the time) modern breech-loading Snider-Enfield rifles obtained from Great Britain as well as Krupp field guns purchased from Prussia. \n\nIt's around this point that the dumbest, cringiest, weebiest line in the film is uttered. Peter Pettigrew tells Maverick \"Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself with guns\". U WOT M8? As I had said before, guns had been a staple of Japanese warfare for over 300 years by that point. Saigo Takamori, the actual samurai who led the Satsuma Rebellion, on whom Katsumoto is based, was a military modernist who was almost exclusively portrayed wearing a [western-style military uniform](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/SaigoTakamoriUniform.jpg), and who's army was equipped with Enfield rifled muskets as well as artillery. That said, near the end of the Rebellion, the rebels did make a final charge with swords, but only because at that point they had run out of ammunition after being hounded across the countryside by the larger and better-equipped Imperial Army. The actual samurai, and especially Saigo Takamori, were not idiots, and knew that stubbornly holding on to outdated weapons and tactics because MUH BUSHIDO gets you killed pointlessly.\n\nMini-side rant, why the hell does the army decide that a foggy forest is the ideal battlefield? They picked the one place that best nullifies their tactical advantages and favors the enemy, who without guns would otherwise stand little chance. That's more a question for /r/BadTactics though.\n\nThis is a good segway into the cause of the rebellion and what the Satsuma were actually fighting for. In the film, it's claimed that Katsumoto is rebelling against the increasing western influence over Japan and the threat it poses to Japanese culture and traditions, which is ironic as the real life Saigo Takamori as I said before preferred to be seen in a western uniform and led a western-style army. In reality, Takamori and the other rebel samurai rebelled because the modern Japanese military and society had no more use for a heavily privileged class of warrior aristocrats, and had begun curtailing their power and privileges. And honestly, it wasn't without reason. One thing the film glosses over is the fear and resentment the average commoners likely felt towards a class of people who among other things had a right to kill any commoner who offended their honor. The closest we get to this is when a group of Imperial soldiers accost one of the samurai and cut his topknot off, though the film doesn't give any context to this and basically makes it look like the soldiers are just dickheads all hopped up on Evil Western Influence. \n\nLater on in the film, while Jack Reacher is staying with Katsumoto and friends, a group of ninjas appears and attacks the village. This is highly stupid for a number of reasons, most notably that the ninja hadn't been a thing since the feudal era. Also, the ninjas are dressed as ninjas. In reality, a ninja, being a spy/assassin/agent, would dress as inconspicuously as possible in order to avoid notice. The concept of the ninja as being a dude clad in black \"ninja clothing\" originated from Japanese theater, in which the stagehands wore black masks and clothing so as to not distract the audience. In these plays, actors portraying ninjas would also dress like stagehands, so when they leapt onto stage it was a surprise for the viewers. Also for some reason, the ninjas attack en masse using stereotypical ninja weapons such as shurikens and straight-bladed ninjato swords (which were not a real thing), when they could have just behaved like proper assassins and poisoned Katsumoto's drink or murdered him in his sleep.\n\nAfter this, the gang travels back to Tokyo, where the Imperial Army has apparently researched the next level on the tech tree, because in the span of one winter they have magically upgraded from a bunch of scared, untrained, undisciplined peasants with muskets to a trained army with modern uniforms and model '71 Mauser rifles, which is HORRIBLY WRONG because in reality the Imperial Army at the time of the Satsuma Rebellion used breech-loading Snider-Enfield rifles, though they did get the Mausers later on, so I guess maybe I can forgive them. Not that it matters, because the heroes escape later while the soldiers with their state of the art rifles fail to hit them at close range.\n\nThe film climaxes with the Battle of Shiroyama, which doesn't make any particularly glaring errors beyond the omission of the Imperial Army basically building a wall of fortifications around the rebel positions, the Imperial Navy shelling the rebels, and the rebels having plenty of guns (but not plenty of ammo by that point). \n\nAll in all, The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, but I have to put it in a similar category as stuff like The Patriot and Braveheart, presenting a romanticized view of the samurai and making it about a clash of modernity and tradition rather than the dying gasp of a group of outmoded aristocrats. \n\nThanks for reading, hope you all enjoyed!\n\nPrimary source used: *Japan's Imperial Army: Its Rise and Fall, 1853-1945* by Edward Drea\n\nAdditional sources: wikipedia articles on the Satsuma Rebellion, the 1871 Mauser, and Ninjas, mostly to fill in the gaps in my primary source.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I mean... how do you even come to this conclusion?\n\nYes, France was devastated by WWI, they suffered horrible losses and much of the destruction of the Western Front was not only concentrated in French Territory but in an industrially significant region of France.  However it's ridiculous to say the entire war in Europe was fought \"Primarily on French Soil\" by just about any metric I can think of.\n\nBy casualties?  I'll generously give him the casualties incurred on Belgian soil as well leading to a figure of roughly 13 Million casualties incurred on French soil between both sides.  The total for the entire war is around 36 Million between both sides so by that metric about a third of the war was fought on French Soil.\n\nHow about by total number of soldiers deployed?  Again, counting Belgium as 'French Soil' we see roughly 29 Million soldiers deployed on French soil out of a total of roughly 62 Million so that's slightly better, that way a bit under half of the war was fought on French soil.\n\nIt's certainly not by actual depth of contested territory, Russia wins that category unless you go by percentage of pre-war territory in which case it's hard to beat Serbia sitting at a nice clean 100%.\n\nI assume what happened is that our friend heard somewhere, correctly, that the majority of the Western Front was fought on French soil and then somehow either didn't know that other fronts in Europe existed or just decided that Russia, Austro-Hungary, Serbia, Belgium, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Germany just aren't actually part of Europe.\n\nEdit: I realized after writing this that I stupidly included the casualties for non-European theaters and have adjusted the numbers to match.\n",

Now I know that the title can be interpeted in a couple of ways and the Sacred Band of Thebes where lovers coupled together. But the person in the /r/askreddit thread implied that gay people in the modern context as openly homosexual joined this force, or where picked out by the government. \n\nThey where selected lovers, not gay as we know it today. It was a more normal occurance in ancient Greece to have a male lover. The Sacred Band were soldiers coupled together and consisted of men around 20 to 30 years old.\n\n''According to Plutarch, the 300 hand-picked men were chosen by Gorgidas purely for ability and merit, regardless of social class.[18] It was composed of 150 male couples,[16] each pair consisting of an older erastês (ἐραστής, \"lover\") and a younger erômenos (ἐρώμενος, \"beloved\").[19] Athenaeus of Naucratis also records the Sacred Band as being composed of \"lovers and their favorites, thus indicating the dignity of the god Eros in that they embrace a glorious death in preference to a dishonorable and reprehensible life\";[10] while Polyaenus describes the Sacred Band as being composed of men \"devoted to each other by mutual obligations of love\".[8] The origin of the \"sacred\" appellation of the Sacred Band is unexplained by Dinarchus and other historians. But Plutarch claims that it was due to an exchange of sacred vows between lover and beloved at the shrine of Iolaus (one of the lovers of Hercules) at Thebes. He also tangentially mentions Plato's characterization of the lover as a \"friend inspired of God\".[18][19]''\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7jl1g0/straight_people_of_reddit_what_questions_do_you/dr7qb2s/\n\nSo the bad history of this is that they where not a elite gay force but picked out guys ranging from 20-30 and coupled together as lovers.",

        "text": "So I lied slightly. The first couple pieces of badhistory are in the title of the video under which the comment section resides: \"The Dark Ages - Sacred Medieval Chants (Album)\". I think we've had enough debunking of the myth of the Dark Ages on this sub, so I'll just casually mention that no, the \"Dark Ages\" were not really all that dark, especially for non-Europeans.  However, I do take more extensive issue with the phrase \"Sacred Medieval Chants\", as well as the inclusion of \"Album\". Dealing with first things first, songs in of themselves are not sacred to Christians, and implying otherwise is kind of ridiculous. Existing songs were modified and new songs were created all the time during the historical period the video claims to represent. These aren't even all songs dealing directly with things Christians actually define as sacred*! Secondly, since the idea of an album didn't exist till the late 19th century, far too late for this to be a medieval church choir's collected works, and as far as I can tell this video is not an album ripped from somewhere else and instead an original compilation, the word \"Album\" in the title is just a flat-out lie.\n\nBut the above paragraph was mostly a distraction from the juicy stuff - the comments. Let's start with\n&gt; Ahahahaha ! \"The dark ages\" !! That was in fact the higher point in Occident history ! From this point we are falling faster and faster ...﻿&gt; \n\nThis piece of wisdom was provided to us by \"france origine garantie fr\". This comment goes the opposite direction to most of the badhistory we see about the \"Dark Ages\", and claims that the period was the highest point in European history. I can't really know what criteria the subject is using for this judgement, but my best guess is the supremacy of the culture of honor mindset. This is a remarkably dumb way to measure high points in a region's history, but I'm not making the rules here, since \"highest point\" is an entirely subjective judgment. But even by his (or hers, lets not be making judgments here) own standard, france orignine is wrong. There is indeed plenty of examples of \"Dark Ages\" characters taking revenge for slights, real or imagined. A famous example would be Charlemagne's murder of one of his soldiers, in revenge for the smashing of a plundered artifact Charlemagne wished to return to its rightful owners. But the system of slights and revenge was largely motivated by pragmatism - English and French kings put up with slights by their nobles all the time, because the alternative was a showdown they were not confident of winning. It was in many ways similar to the sort of code of honor we see in modern gangs - its exists and persists because if people didn't follow it, there would be no disincentive to mess with other gang members, since appealing to the authorities is impossible. The only real difference is the reason why authorities can't be involved - during the medieval period, there weren't really any authorities to appeal to. In contrast, during the height of dueling enthusiasm in the early Renaissance period, thousands of French nobles killed each other for no logical reason at all. The French Crown was both smart enough to realize that letting its subordinate nobles fight was dangerous for a number of reasons, and powerful enough to enforce a peace between any of its subjects. A culture of honor perpetuated itself purely because the people participating in it wanted it to. This, I would argue, is a purer culture of honor than one imposed by the realities of the situation, and one more likely to be universal. France origine, therefore, should probably consider the early Renaissance the highest point in European history, and saying anything else should be considered bad history. \n\nThis concludes Part 1 of \"Dark Ages 2: Muscle-Powered Boogaloo\". If I have time tomorrow, I'll dissect another comment or two.\n \n*Well, at least one song - the song cited in the description - doesn't. Since he doesn't give a song list, and I don't speak Latin and am nowhere near familiar enough with this subject to recognize chants by ear, I'm forced to Google Translate the one title I have.\n\nSources\n\n*The Plantagenets* by Daniel Jones.\n\n*Spielvogel* (I have a older version, which is for the best, since the newer ones tend to be more inaccurate.)\n\nThe \"Album\" Wikipedia page.\n\n*Why Violence has Declined* by Steven Pinker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfwu6LVndGY&amp;ab_channel=ValedoMago The mine of bad history.\n\n\nEDIT: Embarrassingly, I appear to have confused Clovis with Charlemagne.

        "text": "The article: http://www.history.com/news/why-jews-and-muslims-both-have-religious-claims-on-jerusalem\n\nEdit: the article was updated since I started writing this. The old version: https://web.archive.org/web/20171210175407/http://www.history.com/news/why-jews-and-muslims-both-have-religious-claims-on-jerusalem\n\nI know anything dealing with Israel and Palestine inevitably gets close to Rule 2 territory. But let's give this a shot anyway as my first badhistory.\n\n&gt;Although Israel’s official capital is Tel Aviv, the country has long considered Jerusalem as its unofficial capital.\n\nIsrael moved its seat of government from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 1949 and has considered Jerusalem its capital ever since. Any possible ambiguity as to Israel's position was removed in 1980 with the Jerusalem Law.\n\n&gt;Jerusalem, which is one of the oldest cities in the world, has been formally divided between Israel and Palestine for nearly 70 years,\n\nWithout saying anything about the current political debate and the validity of competing claims, the Palestinian Authority or State of Palestine do not govern any part of Jerusalem and never have so it can definitely not be said to be *formally* divided between Israel and Palestine. Demographically, it's divided but there's nothing formal about that. It's status is viewed by most parties as subject to negotiations, even if most agree that East Jerusalem will be the capital of Palestine. The city was divided between Israel and Jordan until 1967 and that's the only formal division the city has seen since.\n\n&gt;Israel and Palestine’s dueling claims to the city are steeped in decades of conflict, during which Jewish settlers pushed Muslim Arabs out of their homes and established the state of Israel on their land in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nFor Jerusalem in particular, the city has had a Jewish majority since the mid 19th century. Arabs were not displaced by this process as the neighborhoods of what is now West Jerusalem were built from the ground up. Again, this happened a full one hundred years before the establishment of Israel and long before the middle of the 20th century. During the war in 1947-1949, East Jerusalem was ethnically cleansed of Jews and the Jewish Quarter of the Old City was destroyed. Similar events happened to Arabs in surrounding villages of Jerusalem like Deir Yassin, but even if one agrees broadly with the interpretation from the quoted text, to characterize the founding of Israel and the modern history of Jerusalem in one sentence and solely in terms of Jews kicking out Arabs is bad history.\n\n&gt;The city fell in and out of other hands during the next couple of millenia; particularly during the crusades, when Christian crusaders fought competing Christian and Muslim factions for control of the city.\n\nIf the author had just said that the crusaders fought against Muslims, I wouldn't be nitpicky. But the author mentioned crusaders fighting competing Christians when the city was politically controlled solely by Muslims. The Jews of Jerusalem fought alongside the Muslims against the crusaders as well and should have also been mentioned. In Haifa, Jews almost exclusively made up the garrison that defended against the crusaders so to leave them out of a description of the crusades while including \"competing Christians\" is bad history.\n\n&gt;Picture caption: Religious Jewish men praying at The Western Wall, Judaism’s holiest site, ahead of the Sabbath\n\nThis is more bad religion than bad history but I'll just point out that the Western Wall is not the holiest site in Judaism. That would be the Temple Mount above it where the Dome of the Rock is located. Specifically, the holiest site is the Holy of Holies, the exact location of which underneath the Temple Mount complex is not definitively known.\n\n",

        "text": "Hi. I wondered whether anyone writes master's theses or doctoral dissertations that are specifically written to debunk bad historical theories.\n\n(Or even if it *could* be done.)\n\nI'm curious about this question for a couple reasons:\n\n1) Bad historical theories flourish partly because nobody in academia has enough time to debunk them comprehensively. Most of the debunkings (e.g., of Jesus mythicism by Ehrman, Shakespeare authorship theories by Shapiro, ancient aliens by Heiser, Afrocentrism by Lefkowitz, Lipstadt with Holocaust denial...) are done at a popular level, often by experts who've only been dragged into a controversy because it personally annoyed them.\n\n2) Many theories that are outside mainstream secular history *do* become subjects of doctoral theses, like the several hybrid philosophy/history theses arguing for Jesus' Resurrection. So one would expect that if these non-standard issues could get in, debunkings also should be able to.\n\nOn the other hand, debunking an obviously stupid theory seems like shooting fish in a barrel. A graduate student asking to revisit long-turned-over ground might not get much interest from his or her thesis/dissertation adviser.\n\nSo, since I'm not a member of academia myself, I was very curious about the considerations involved in graduate students trying to work on refuting bad history theories.",

You can only make one nomination per category, but you can vote for as many as you like (the mods are exempt from this rule and will flesh out some categories if they're low on nominations, or have posts that they'll think deserve to be remembered).\n- If you had a nomination but someone else already posted it, just upvote that one and maybe add your 2 obols as to why you agree with that nomination and post a comment under their nomination.\n- Don't make a top level comment. The mods will be irritated with you for interrupting their hibernation and smite the comment. \n- Only post nominations as comments to a top level comment. You can chat under the nomination itself, or in the Peanut Gallery comment.\n\n###The Categories for this year are:###\n\n**Worst History** \n\nThe most horrible and heinous offences against history go here. The type of post that makes you despair for humanity and want to leave the planet. Posts that are questions, discussions, or requests are not allowed here.\n\n**Most Unusual**\n\nThe topic that surprised you, maybe because it was something you never expected to have bad history.

Some of things that jump out to me as I view this. \n\n1.) Modern English.  While it's pretty hard to determine exactly when the time period is supposed to be, they are all easily understandable to modern ears.  English didn't become the language of the English aristocracy till around the 100 Years War and even then would have been an older version.  I suppose you could say that it doesn't have to take place in England but the critique would still stand and I'm not really aware of any European courts that spoke English as a court language. \n\n2.) That's the drabbest looking hall I've ever seen.  I mean it's not impossible but the hall was supposed to be an impressive place to entertain guests with plenty of tapestries and paintings.  Medievals liked color too! It's like whenever you see a church from the middle ages and it's this barren ugly monstrosity instead of a hand made piece of art. Then again, they are drinking bud so maybe this was the best they could do. [Here](http://www.castlesandmanorhouses.com/life_01_rooms.htm#hall) is a nice collection of Great Halls for reference.\n\n3.)  Lots of torches instead of candles everywhere.  Kudos for a few candles on the tables though (though they are suspiciously big and modern looking). \n\n4.) Modern beer containers gives the impression of modern industrial practices which they just didn't have back then.  \n\n5.) Bud Light wasn't invented till 1982, it would not have been available centuries ago.  This has to be pretty embarrassing for whoever created this ad.  Real PR nightmare.  \n\n6.) You couldn't just throw someone in a pit. The Middle Ages inherited the concept of jury trials from the Romans and used them.  Manor trials were also communal affairs. Magna Carta was around since the 12th century.  \n\n7.) Mead would likely have been more in demand instead of beer giving the climate.  Though I'm also sure that \"barrell aged\" wasn't really popular till experiments done in the 60's though people did know that it made a difference. \n\n8.) How come no one announces who these people are?  And where is the butler, the guy literally in charge of the buttery (beer room)?  Seems like a real missed opportunity.  \n\n8.) Dilly  This is the one that gets me.  According to [this ](http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article181006346.html) article it's a reference to some slang from the 30's meaning delightful.  The etymology dictionary it could have been shorthand for a 19th century french stage coach.  Either way, it was not a word available in the middle ages. \n\nDon't get your history from a domestic beer commercial. ",

This era was the start of one of many party realignments in America, this one culminating in the 1932 election and the formation of the New Deal Coalition and the Democratic party we know today. In the 1920s, however, the Republican party was home to a variety of political viewpoints. Unlike what our author would lead you to believe, there was a strong progressive wing to be found in the West and Midwest, including notable Senators [Hiram Johnson of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Johnson), [Robert la Follette Sr. of Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette_Sr.) (and Jr - though he ran as an independent Progressive) and [William Borah of Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Borah). While it is true that many individuals would migrate over to the Democratic Party, these gentlemen served as isolationist, pro-inflationary Senators - and here we reach the major problem of this article, at least in my mind. \n\nThe author attempts to retroactively apply modern political labels and policy positions to historical figures - \"trickle-down\" didn't exist in 1929. Keynes was just starting to gain traction as a thinker and policymaker, and the country was still on the gold standard. Inflation and deflation were the primary economic issues of debate as almost nobody was rich enough to pay income tax, having only been permanently implemented in 1913. It is true Treasury Secretary Mellon lowered tax rates in the hope of spurring growth - but again these taxes were not nearly as widespread as they were today. \n\nI can keep going but I hope I've proven my point. For a \"depression historian\", this article is shockingly unacademic and lazy. Basic factual errors aside, it commits in my mind one of the biggest sins in academia - attempting to place modern political ideas in a historical context, ignoring the context of the original ideas, and lazily shoehorns in a political message.\n\nI hope I don't get into too much R2 territory here, but I completely agree that the GOP's tax plan is a terrible one. This, however, is exactly the *wrong* way to go about arguing against it. Flashy, disingenuous clickbait articles only serve to help the other side, no matter what the topic is. \n\nSources Consulted:\n\nKennedy, David. *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War 1929-1945* (New York 1999)\n\nDerber, Milton, and Young, Edwin (Eds.) *Labor and the New Deal* (Madison 1957)\n\n\n\n",

        "author": "Tiako",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7i72m0/far_cry_primal_is_a_far_cry_from_an_accurate/",
        "text": "Far Cry, for those who don’t know, is arguably (I would argue) the foremost B series in video games. Where your Fallout and your Final Fantasy aspire to a certain level of seriousness, Far Cry is pure, B-story schlock deeply rooted in the Boy’s Own Adventure tradition. Far Cry 3 had legitimately great characterization and an innovative gameplay loop, which confused people into thinking the series was somehow less than ridiculous, but it never was, and Primal makes that very clear.\n\nThe game is Far Cry in 10,000 BCE, with something of an excuse plot I will refrain from summarizing but [this will give you the gist of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reOLeLX0Q9U)\n\nThe first problem crops up with the date, 10,000 BCE, which is something of a stock choice for “caveman stories” but is actually a trifle inconvenient for the purposes of the setting. 10,000 BCE was during the Younger Dryas, a sharp millennium of cold caused by the flooding of glacial meltwater into the Atlantic (not by a comet, despite what certain charlatans claim) that briefly brought back the conditions of the Ice Age. 10,000 BCE is later in it (the Younger Dryas is conventionally dated to about 10,700 BCE to 9,500 BCE with [exceptionally sharp edges](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/The%20Younger%20Dryas), the end of it is characterized by temperature changes in Greenland of about ten degrees centigrade in a decade) but still certainly within it. The game, however, portrays a very distinctly Mesolithic environment: rather than the sub-Arctic tundra that characterized much of Europe during the Younger Dryas, the landscape is filled with the deciduous forest that colonized the landscape with warming temperatures. Really it looks a lot like western North American redwood forests, but leaving that aside, mid summer temperatures during the Younger Dryas for central Europe [was about 13 degrees celsius](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589498920233\n), roughly equivalent to northern Scandinavia, and this landscape does not look like northern Scandinavia.\n\nSo the opening cutscene starts with a shaman dude in an antler hat painting stuff on a cave wall. I’ll deal with these three problems in increasing inaccuracy: first off is shamanism, which honestly is not worth dealing wit because the ship containing any real meaning for that word sailed a good two hundred years ago. The term originated in Siberia and should have stayed there with a sort of circumpolar and central Asian addendum, but just glancing at the Wikipedia page will show that it now encompasses any sort of ecstatic ritual celebrant, from Congo to Kamchatka--well, not any. There is no meaningful way to exclude, say, Joel Olsteen from thsi category but you will never see him called a “shaman” because that term is reserved for primitives. Anyway. His antler hat is ripped off of the Star Carr site in northern England, a considerable distance from central Europe, and a bunch of other people wear antler hats that are similarly displaced but they look fly as fuck so I won’t complain.\n\nThe cave painting is a much bigger issue here. Cave paintings form a very important part of the aesthetic of the game, being used to track story moments, mark important spots, and provide setting flavor. There is only one problem: the cave painting tradition the game is using (primarily imitating Lascaux and Altamira) had been abandoned long before the game is set. The Lascaux paintings, for example, are generally put around 13,000 BCE, but more important than the matter of years, given how notoriously difficult precise dating that far back is, is dating on theme. As noted above, the setting is very distinctly Mesolithic while the cave painting tradition is distinctly Paleolithic. More importantly, your first enemies in the game, the Udam (cannibalistic Neanderthal who worship the Venus of Willendorf, which in a whole ‘nother thing) are portrayed as the Ice Age throwbacks who are dying out, when it was the “Ice Age” humans who made the cave paintings.\n\nPerhaps the greatest inaccuracy in the game, perhaps even more so than those regarding temperature if such a thing is possible, is that regarding language. The characters in the game all talk in a sort of me-Tarzan-you-Jane that basically makes anything like, you know, characterization or enjoyable dialogue to be impossible. But it is all for the setting! We can’t expect cavemen to have as complex a language as us, right? Wrong! Leaving aside the Neanderthal Udam, and seriously I don’t want to touch that, the characters in the game are homo sapiens and taken as a whole homo sapiens 12,000 years ago were biologically the same as homo sapiens today, and homo sapiens 50,000 years ago, and homo sapiens 100,000 years ago. Now to be fair, here is a certain debate about “anatomical modernity” and behavioral modernity”, which broadly speaking says that while homo sapiens anatomically identical to modern homo sapiens appeared about 200,000 years ago they did not exhibit the characteristics of higher level thinking, cultural, language, etc until much later. I personally think this is based on a rather poor reading of the evidence, but even if you take the most old school approach to this, “behavioral modernity” appears at least 50,000 years ago, much before the game’s setting. So we are dealing with humans, just as smart as modern humans, just as creative, with a cultural setting just as rich, and, relevant to this, a language just as complex and capable of expression. Now there is a debate in linguistics about whether all languages are actually of equal complexity that I won’t wade into, but it tends to focus on something marginal to what the game is doing. That is, the question is whether some languages are able to express equivalent meanings in simppler or more complex ways, not whether certain languages are not complex enough to express certain meanings only more complex languages can. [This is a good overview](http://www.languagesoftheworld.info/linguistic-typology/what-is-linguistic-complexity-and-how-to-measure-it.html). So, broadly speaking, not only does the writing style in this game actively lessen enjoyment by making any and all interactions kind of tedious, it is also linguistically misleading!\n\nSo, they takes us to the end of the opening cutscene, and the game begins, as it must, with a mammoth hunt! One character turns to us and solemnly says that if we don’t bring this mammoth down, we will starve! Which is wrong in a lot of ways, actually. While it is conceivable that there may have been a situation at one point in which one group of humans were saved from starvation by a mammoth hunt, that is certainly not characteristic of the Mesolithic setting of the game, in which the pattern of hunting changed from the large kills of the Ice Age tundra to smaller hunts of, particularly red deer. Mammoths have a lot of meat on them, but so do deer, and are considerably less hazardous to hunt. There are also, like, plants and stuff--outside of a few very specific cases like the Arctic plants provide the staple of hunter gatherer diets, which makes sense given that plants are everywhere and do not often run away. Fish, too. Also raps. All I am saying is that your tribe of hunter gatherers are shitty hunter gatherers and deserved to be killed by a tiger.\n\nThe hookshot on the other hand is 100% realistic.\n\nA book I am going through right now on this is Steven Mithen’s *After the Ice*, which is honestly one of the best history books I have ever read. Also good reads are *Cro-Magnon* by Brian Fagan and *The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe* ed Barry Cunliffe. All of these are pretty widely available and not super academic, because to be honest you don’t need to be for this game.\n",

        "text": "[This person](https://np.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/6gc5zv/in_the_70s_and_80s_japanese_technology_companies/dipm510/) typed up a long, two-part post based on \"personal research and conjecture,\" in which they claimed that Japan lost their competitiveness in the technology industry (with most Japanese tech companies being too risk-averse to adapt to things such as software development) because of \"collectivist Confucian values introduced early in Japan's history, which are inherently opposed to risk-taking and innovation,\" as opposed to the \"individualist values\" of the Enlightened West™.\n\n&gt;Anyway, despite Japan's westernization on the surface, society here continues to hold many parallels to the the caste system of the Edo/Tokugawa period, and it all has its roots in the Confucian values that the country kept, instead of adopting \"western\" ideals based in the Age of Enlightenment.\n\n&gt;There's a rigid, stratified social hierarchy based on seniority and age. Decision-making and communication is based on consensus, harmony, unspoken social rules, and a select few, tightly-knit relationships built up slowly over time. Things get done depending on relationships within the group. Social organization is based on top-down authority. Everything has its own time and place, rooted in the past; it's about slow, stable change and respecting traditions...\n\n&gt;...The pioneer mentality in the USA is led to the country leading the charge in entrepreneurship. With the rise of venture capital in the 1960s and 1970s, the country turned into an incubator for startups--people who were willing to take a chance on a bold idea, and turn that idea into a company. Reaganomics sowed the seeds for the age of private capital firms and [Mergers &amp; Acquisitions], and the [Venture Capitalist] ecosystem exploded.\n\n&gt;Japan went the completely opposite route. There is a pervasive fear of failure in Japanese culture, and I don't know what causes it. Perhaps it comes from the inherent cultural desires to stick with the steady, reliable, proven approach instead of taking a risk on the unknown. One reason why Japanese startups often struggle is because they have trouble convincing clients to abandon their trusted business connections and take a risk on a new startup. This is definitely less common in the west--if a larger company that has relied on SAP or Oracle years decides that Digital Ocean or Google Cloud's products are better, they'll often make the switch.\n\nI'm not sure about the accuracy of these statements, but I did find [a research paper](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/public/public01_200930_j.html) by Yokotaro Takano of the University of Tokyo stating that the idea that [\"Japan is inherently collectivist\"](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.u-tokyo.ac.jp%2Fpublic%2Fpublic01_200930_j.html&amp;edit-text=) (shitty translation warning) is wrong. Are there any other scholarly articles that either support or refute the assessment above, as I have a feeling that it is based on orientalist stereotypes. And if that turns out to be the case, what really is the primary reason for Japanese businesses in general being \"risk-averse\" and lagging in innovation?\n\n&gt; (shitty translation) Westerners, especially Americans, often use a label called \"individualism\" in a positive sense to describe themselves. It is estimated that when you encountered a Japanese who belongs to a different culture, you might have pasted negative labels called \"collectivism\" on the opposite side of that \"individualism\" in a descending manner. In other words, it can be thought that the \"Japanese = collectivism\" theory was established as a kind of orientalism.\n\n&gt; Reason why the \"Japanese = collectivism\" theory got widespread This common opinion is said to have spread to the world by the American anthropologist Ruth Benedict's book \"Chrysanthemums and Swords\" that was published shortly after the war. People who touched the allegation that \"Japanese are collectivistic\" at this time, brought back to the brain the collectiveistic actions the Japanese had taken during the war, and nodded this claim I guess.\n\n&gt;(original text) 欧米人、とくにアメリカ人は、自らを形容するために、ポジティヴな意味で「個人主義」というレッテルを使うことが多い。異文化に属する日本人に出遭ったとき、その「個人主義」の対極にある「集団主義」というネガティヴなレッテルを天下り的に貼りつけたのではないかと推定される。すなわち、「日本人 ＝ 集団主義」説は、オリエンタリズムの一種として成立したと考えることができる。\n \n\n&gt;「日本人 ＝ 集団主義」説が広まった理由\nこの通説は、戦後間もない時期に出版された、アメリカの人類学者ルース・ベネディクトの著書『菊と刀』によって世間に広まったと言われている。この時期、「日本人は集団主義的だ」という主張に接したひとびとは、戦時中に日本人がとった、見まがいようのない集団主義的な行動を脳裡に甦らせ、この主張に頷いたのであろう。",

        "text": "Recently I came across the following Facebook comment:\n&gt; Tito and his government deliberately drew the boundaries of Serbia smaller than the Serb population, to moderate the Serbs numerical preponderance. That is why there were sizeable Serb minorities in the other provinces, most problematically in Bosnia and Croatia.\n\nFirstly, I just want to get out of the way the inaccuracy of referring to Bosnia and Croatia as \"provinces\". They were *republics* - provinces were a different level of administrative unit in Titoist Yugoslavia, reserved for Kosovo and Vojvodina.\n\nSecondly, the main substance of this post. The comment repeats a popular assumption regarding the Yugoslav Wars that the boundaries between the republics and provinces drawn by Tito and Djilas during and after WW2 were \"arbitrary\", \"artificial\", drawn to favour/disadvantage Serbs/Croats (delete as applicable), etc. \n\nUnsurprisingly, it's a staple of Serb nationalist Lost Cause accounts, such as our old badhistory friend [Diana Johnstone](https://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/21/ukraine-and-yugoslavia/):\n&gt; Tito, a Croat, gave almost the whole Adriatic coastline of Yugoslavia to Croatia, and generally enforced administrative borders detrimental to the Serbs.\n\nBut more worrying than its adoption by fringe apologists is how much it's been accepted by more mainstream commentators. The memoirs of David Owen, one of the major international mediators in the Yugoslav Wars, is one contemporary example:\n&gt; \"the administrative boundaries of the republics and autonomous provinces within post-war Yugoslavia... were made quickly, 'during a march' without the fullest consideration, and were often arbitrary and driven by political expediency\" - *Balkan Odyssey*, p. 34.\n\nIt's also been seen more recently, such as in *Foreign Policy* [by James Stavridis](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/06/lessons-from-the-balkans-for-syria):\n&gt; There once was a country created by artificially drawn borders.... Yes, it sounds like Syria. But it was the Balkans in the 1990s.\n\nSo, what's the problem with this? Well, to illustrate my point, [here's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Scs_kingdom_provinces_1920_1922_en.png/800px-Scs_kingdom_provinces_1920_1922_en.png) a map of the internal divisions of Yugoslavia (or, strictly speaking, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as it was then) from just after its formation in 1918 until 1922. Then compare it to [the divisions under Tito](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/SocialistYugoslavia_en.svg/800px-SocialistYugoslavia_en.svg.png).\n\nYeah, it's different. But it's not *that* different. And indeed, the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, generally the biggest focus of the \"arbitrary\" charge, were left overwhelmingly unaltered, with only minor changes. Contrary to Johnstone's claims about Tito \"giving\" the Adriatic coast to Croatia, the new borders actually slightly expanded Montenegro's share of the coast at Dalmatia's expense. The northern border of \"Northern Serbia\" in the 1918 map is essentially the same as the boundary between Vojvodina and Serbia proper even today, even if Tito did transfer Syrmia from Croatia to Vojvodina. While Istria would still be Italian until 1945, the parts of the Slovenia-Croatia boundary that did exist in 1918 are identical to the current border.\n\nFurthermore, even those 1918 boundaries were virtually all based on pre-existing divisions. Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia and BiH had all existed, with the same borders, as lands of the Habsburg Empire (Vojvodina had too, though only from 1848-1860, and with different borders, while Slovenia was basically made up of all the former Habsburg lands annexed by Yugoslavia that were Northwest of Croatia). Montenegro retained the borders it had held as an independent state, while the distinction between Northern and Southern Serbia was basically where Serbia's borders had been before and after the 1912-13 Balkan Wars respectively. The borders between Dalmatia, Croatia-Slavonia and Bosnia had originated as those between Venice, the Habsburgs and the Ottomans respectively.\n\nThe major changes made by the Communists to that 1918 map were, essentially:\n\n* Merging Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia - hardly revolutionary, Croatian elites had been consistently demanding this at least since the Habsburgs had conquered Dalmatia back in 1797. Nor has anyone really disputed this union since 1945.\n\n* Merging Vojvodina into Serbia as an autonomous province - same again, Vojvodina as a distinct polity had originated in 1848 [as an entity explicitly identifying as \"Serbian\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Vojvodina), and it had been the main centre of Serbian Orthodox Christians in the Habsburg Empire since the 1690s. Aside from a handful of Hungarian irredentists like Jobbik, and not-really-serious claims by Croat nationalists since 1990 on some small bits of Syrmia, no-one has really disputed this since 1945 either.\n\n* Kosovo as an autonomous province - sort of new. Kosovo had been a province within the Ottoman Empire, but new boundaries had to be drawn because Ottoman Kosovo was much larger than modern Kosovo. \n\n* Macedonia - this was the only completely unprecedented innovation in the border-drawing. While the claims of some Greek nationalists that the modern Republic of Macedonia is a complete invention of Tito are untrue (a distinct Macedonian Slavic nationalist movement had first emerged at the end of the 19th Century), the actual existence of a distinct Slavic Macedonian political unit *was* something new. Yet, in comparison to the rest of the region since 1990, the Macedonia-Serbia border has proved pretty uncontroversial.\n\nTo summarise, far from inventing new and arbitrary borders, Tito, Djilas and co. largely accepted and affirmed long-established prior borders. The assumption that they should have drawn borders in accordance with the geographic distributions of Serbs/Croats/Bosniaks/etc would have been a far more unprecedented (not to mention idealistic and not really practical) move than the decisions they actually did go with.",

        "text": "Scrolling through Communism 101 I saw a question from someone asking how to \"debunk\" the rape of Berlin. The results are about as bad as you would expect, so I'll pick out some of the juicier ones.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/7gr06i/rape_of_berlin/\n\nThe first response, with 23 upvotes:\n\n&gt;Iirc Stalin gave the death penalty for rape, and Germans were to be treated like citizens. Of course, on the ground this was hard to enforce. Arguing against it is difficult, but it has nothing to do with communism: unfortunately it is a situation in almost every military conflict\n\nFirst of all, I have not seen anything to suggest that Stalin wanted the death penalty for the rape of German women. However, Yugoslavian politician Milovan Djilas did recall a conversation with Stalin after he and Tito protested the rape of Yugoslavian women to General Korneev of the Soviet Military. What did Stalin have to say about all of this: \"And such an Army was insulted by no one else but Djilas! Djilas, of whom I could least have expected such a thing, a man whom I received so well! And an Army which did not spare its blood for you! Does Djilas, who is himself a writer, not know what human suffering and the human heart are? Can't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?\" Is this the attitude of a person who would want the death penalty for the rape of German women, considering his reaction to the rape of Yugoslavian women?\n\nSecondly, any order to treat the Germans as \"citizens\" was not followed through by the Soviet leadership. According to a female telephone operator: \"When we occupied every town, we had first three days for looting and ... [rapes]. That was unofficial of course. But after three days one could be court-martialed for doing this.\" Naimark wrote that it was after the summer of 1945 that Soviet troops were punished for rape. According to Anthony Beevor, the NKVD was aware of the mass rape by Soviet Troops in Germany, but did not act on it. I'd question, considering this information, why the existence of an order that was not followed, nor considering Stalin's comments made in good faith, is a defense of Soviet actions.\n\nThe second response, with 5 upvotes:\n\n&gt;It can be both true and at the same time irrelevant to debates about Communism (both as an economic system and as an actual regime form). Rape is unfortunately one of the more common war crimes, performed by almost every army to some extent and the behaviour of those soldiers did very little to do with the ideology from which they came, but can be associated with:\n\n&gt; * Coming from the country that has suffered the worst [as a country] under the hands of the Germans, including mass-massacres, hunger, whole villages plundered/burnt down, people were taken as slave workers and/or just killed and of course - women raped massively. Not being \"rape apologetic\" here of course, but think of the mentality of a simple soldier from somewhere in the Ukraine or Belarus who knows what his sister(s) [literal and figuratively] have suffered, and goes into Berlin; some of them have also liberated Concentration Camps and have seen Nazi bestiality in its worst.\n\n &gt; * Simply the \"power of numbers\", there were many more Red Army soldiers into Germany in the first days as other Allied soldiers and indeed, recent research indicates that rapes were also massive in the other occupation zones, this was unfortunately true to Brits/Americans as well.\n\n&gt; * A third issue is a bit more complicated, which is: possible rape/massacre at the hands of the \"Soviet beasts\" was repeatedly pfeatured in Nazi propaganda, so when things like that happened, they were a confirmation of what people have envisioned as the alleged bestiality of the Soviets and perhaps even a reason (relatively) more women spoke about it, as it was \"expected\" and less of a taboo to talk about it as about rape by the \"good saviours\" from the UK / US\n\nThe first point regarding revenge is ignorant of the mass rape of women outside of Germany, including Soviet women liberated from Concentration Camps. Why would a Soviet soldier angered by the rape of Soviet women rape Soviet women liberated from a Concentration Camp? \n\nThe second point implies that there were more rapes by Soviet troops then Western troops simply because there were more Soviet troops in Germany. Yet the number of Soviet troops against Western troops (6 million on the Eastern front vs 4.5 million invading Germany from the West) compared to the amount of rapes committed in Germany (1.5 million by Soviet troops according to Beevor, vs a much small number from the Western allies) does not seem to support the hypothesis that the greater number of rapes by Soviet troops was simply due to their larger numbers, but rather a stronger inclination towards rape then their Western counterparts.\n\nThe third point on Nazi propaganda does not come with any evidence for such a claim. Considering much of the rape of Berlin, alongside other areas occupied by the Soviets, happened after the fall of the Nazi regime, I fail to see how those crimes were simply made up by the Nazis (nor the countless accounts of victims or perpetrators.) For these claims to have been Nazi propaganda, the Nazi propaganda department would have had to have lived on long after the regime.\n\nThe final comment I'll touch on, with 3 upvotes:\n\n&gt;i did a lot of research in this topic, ill try to find some sources for you. but from what ive found the rape of berlin is heavily over exaggerated. mostly due to the work of joseph goebbels, the lead propagandist for nazi germany. as the red army started to march into germany, they started a massive campaign stating how the reds would rape the purity out of your daughters and wives. indeed some rapes did happen, but in 1944 i believe orders came down directly from stalin stating that red army soldiers cannot harm german citizens, from that moment on you could be shot for raping.\n\n&gt;after the war, the US needed something to discredit the ussr, so they just used goebbels work, and now it is upheld as history. interesting thing is the americans and british raped tons of germans as well, but you never hear about that.\n\nOnce again, they begin with the claim that the Rape of Berlin was Nazi Propaganda, created by Goebbels. This was presumably after his death, considering the occupation of Berlin was after Goebbels death. There is also mention of how Stalin supposedly stated that Soviet troops cannot harm German citizens, despite his own views of rape by Soviet troops and the lack of enforcement of any such order by the Soviet regime.\n\nFinally, there's the odd claim that the US have specifically pushed the Rape of Berlin to discredit the USSR and avoided reflection on their own crimes. This ignores the accounts by victims and perpetrators, the protests by Eastern European and other Communist political leaders against Soviet rapes in their countries (including that of Yugoslavia I previously mentioned, but also Czechoslovakia and Chinese Communists,) and the existence of books such as \"Taken by Force,\" by US historians which specifically deal with US rapes.\n\nThis is my first post on this Subreddit, so feel free to correct me if I have anything wrong, or if I need to add anything.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes\n",

I, of course, try to point out that the rebellion was based on slavery:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7gnsr1/eli5_why_do_many_people_claiming_to_be_us/dqkfant/\n\nNow, because of the 20 year rule, I'm not going to get into the supposed parallels between today's Northern and Southern California and the Civil War. The link in the other reply is interesting, though, because I believe that the person who posted it wanted to refute my point that the civil War was primarily about slavery.\n\nThe link in question: https://www.thoughtco.com/top-causes-of-the-civil-war-104532\n\nLet's just look at the headlines and some selected quotes for the \"Top Causes of the Civil War\"\n\n**ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DIFFERENCES**\n\n&gt; When Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became very profitable.\n\n&gt;This machine was able to reduce the time it took to separate seeds from the cotton. At the same time, the increase in the number of plantations willing to move from other crops to cotton meant the greater need for a large amount of cheap labor such as slaves. **The southern economy became a one-crop economy, depending on cotton and therefore on slavery.**\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n**STATES VS. FEDERAL RIGHTS**\n\n&gt; Many felt that the new constitution ignored the rights of states to continue to act independently. They felt that the states should still have the right to decide if they were willing to accept certain federal acts.\n\n&gt; This resulted in the idea of nullification, whereby the states would have the right to rule federal acts unconstitutional. The federal government denied states this right. However, proponents such as John C. Calhoun—who resigned as Vice President to represent South Carolina in the Senate—fought vehemently for nullification. When nullification would not work and many of the southern states felt that they were no longer respected, they moved towards thoughts of secession.\n\nCalhoun resigned from the Vice Presidency in 1832, almost 30 years before the Civil War. And about a year afterwards, President Jackson had this to say:\n\n&gt; the tariff was only a pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question.\n\n**SLAVE AND NON-SLAVE STATES**\n\n**THE ABOLITIONIST MOVEMENT**\n\nSo, slavery, right?\n\n**THE ELECTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN**\n\n&gt; In the North, this new party was seen as both anti-slavery and for the advancement of the American economy. This included the support of industry and encouraging homesteading while advancing educational opportunities. In the South, Republicans were seen as little more than divisive.\n\n&gt; They believed that Lincoln was anti-slavery and in favor of Northern interests. \n\nNothing said about why it was that Lincoln and the Republicans were seen as \"divisive,\" besides, of course, the whole slavery thing.\n\nSo, to conclude, 4/5 of the \"Top Causes of the Civil War\" are directly linked to slavery, and the 5th was recognized even then as a pretext for bigger problems, with the slavery question looming. The guy just posted the link, didn't say anything more, so I'm not sure of his intentions, but unless they were to prove that the Civil War was based on slavery, it falls under BadHistory. And to the person who wrote the article, I'll only say that you remind me of a younger me. Specifically, the middle school me who often needed to write a 1,000 word essay but only had 150 words of actual substance and no intention of doing any real work. \n\nEDIT:\n\n&gt; I see by the downvotes that the snowflakes are trying to rewrite history.",

        "text": "\"Auschwitz or the Great Alibi\" is an essay [(text here)](http://www.sinistra.net/lib/upt/comlef/cosi/cosiicebie.html) published [in 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_or_the_great_alibi) by the French section of the International Communist Party, a Bordigist Left Communist organization; for whatever reason someone later thought it was worth publishing as an individual pamphlet. The true authorship of the work is unknown because the ICP newspaper published all of it's articles anonymously on behalf of the Party. It has been suggested it was written by Amadeo Bordiga himself, although this is at best unclear; in any case Bordiga took close interest in the publication of works from the ICP and so almost certainly approved it for publication.\n\nThe significance of this work is that it argues that Jews in the Holocaust were not killed because of anti-semitism but because Jews were a petty bourgeois class. It went on to have significant influence in popularizing left-wing versions of Holocaust denial.\n\nIn order to properly examine the essay, it's first necessary to explain the background in which \"Auschwitz\" was produced. \"Left Communism\", briefly, is the label given to Marxist organizations and ideologies which were considered to be to \"the left\" of the Bolsheviks, namely by virtue of them being extremely hardline in tactical terms. The original incarnation of Left Communism was the German-Dutch Left Communists, who effectively held an ideological position that was something like a blend of Anarchism and Marxism: a complete rejection of electoral politics, unions, and the state, and in some cases the rejection of the party form itself; and a total commitment to workers' control. Hence they are also called \"Council Communists\".\n\nThis is not the Left Communism we are talking about. The Left Communism I am talking about comes from Italy, and emerged sometime in the early 1920s, being associated particularly with the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Amadeo Bordiga, although it did not emerge into a fully developed form until after World War Two. Bordiga agreed with the Left Communists on the rejection of electoral politics, but that is basically where the similarity ends. Bordiga has been characterized with the remark that he was \"More Leninist then Lenin\" although a more appropriate comparison would be that he was \"More Stalinist then Stalin\".You may have previously encountered Bordigist left communism on r/shittankiessay or r/shitleftistssay . Bordiga's political positions are:\n\n1. Anti-Democracy. Bordiga believed that Democracy and Capitalism were inextricably bound together and that Democracy could never properly represent the will of the working class since Democracy really meant the manipulation of the passive working class by the bourgeois. In this sense Fascism was really the culmination of Democracy. His opposition to Democracy led him to oppose workers' councils and to insist on something called \"organic centralism\" as opposed to Lenin's \"democratic centralism\", the most concise statement of which can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordigism) as: \"A party based in organic centralism was to not vote on and change its principles with the cooperation of its members, instead it would preserve already correct principles with members accepting these principles. The party would also lead the working class and not participate in parliamentary politics\". To anyone paying attention, this is basically what Stalinists states did, the problem Bordiga had with them was not their authoritarianism but the fact they were \"revisionists\". And that they used money. This is somewhat ironic as pretty much the only reason Bordigism gets attention today is by posing as Anti-Stalinists. When in reality the only real difference they have with Stalinism is that the USSR used money, not the authoritarianism or atrocities.\n\n2. Capitalism defined exclusively by Commodity exchange. This is getting somewhat heavy into Marxist Economic Theory, but briefly, the idea that Commodity exchange is a feature of capitalism is accepted by all Marxists. Bordiga was unique however in insisting that Commodity exchange alone characterized Capitalism rather then also the existence of a ruling class , etc. As Marcel van der Linden notes: \"Bordiga adopted a very idiosyncratic concept of capitalism. Sociological factors, such as the existence of a ruling class or lack of it, or political factors such as the nature of state intervention, played no role at all in his definition; capitalism existed, if an economy consisted of enterprises which calculated revenues and expenditures in terms of a general quantitative equivalent (money) and strove to maximize the difference between outputs and inputs ('profit'). This definition was asserted in separation from the question of who appropriated this 'profit'. Based on this catch-all definition, it was obviously not difficult for Bordiga to 'prove' in a logically consistent way that the nature of the Soviet economy was capitalist. The fact that the Soviet state was qualittatively different from the states in 'normal capitalism' was of little importance to Bordiga. The state, after all, belonged to the superstructure, and therefore could not play a significant role in the characterization of production relations.\" For Bordiga then, the USSR was not even \"state\" capitalism, it was just \"capitalism\", because the USSR used money.\n\n3. Rejection of anti-Fascism. Fascism, according to Bordiga, didn't differ qualitatively from normal capitalism, and so anti-Fascism was \"bourgeois\" since it was convincing the workers that one state of capitalism was better then another. To this end, Bordiga ordered the Italian Communist Party to cease anti-Fascist work and thus greatly enabled Mussolini's consolidation of power; rather unsurprisingly Bordiga was shortly thereafter expelled from the Comintern and replaced by Antonio Gramsci. The French section of the ICP even sent volunteers to Spain during the Civil War, not to fight but specifically to preach to the worker volunteers that they should quit fighting an \"imperialist\" war against Fascism in defense of capitalism. \n\n4. Extremely Mechanical view of history. While most Marxists accept a deterministic element in their analysis of history, the Bordigist view is completely determinist and mechanical. Every action is intrinsically related to the existing social formation in an instrumental way.\n\n5. Adherence to \"scientific socialism\". Bordigists tend to get weirdly hungup on them being characterized as an ideology, since for them it's not an ideology, it's just reality, and their outlook is completely scientific. Marxism is not an ideology (in the normal understanding of the term, not the Marxist sense), it's the Truth, and left communism isn't even distinct from Marxism, left communism is just Marxism properly understood.\n\nNow, before World War Two happened, the idea that Fascism was just an extreme form of capitalism was not so outrageous, and was even the official position of the Comintern for a while. But after the war, with the extreme devastation wrought by the Nazis, this line became much harder to sustain. Hence the need for Bordigists to write \"Auchwitz\".\n\nI've characterized the essay as Holocaust denial, and I stand by that assertion. On the other hand the work clearly agrees that Jews were killed during WW2 by Germany. So what exactly I mean by Holocaust Denial needs to be examined. Holocaust Denial means one of three things:\n\n1. Denial of mass deaths \n\n2. Denial of intentional killing\n\n3. Denial of motive/intentionality\n\nIn other words, you can agree that the Nazis killed lots of Jews during the Second World War, but if you deny that their motive was killing Jews/other \"undesirables\" for ideological reasons (no matter their relation to the particular social formation), then you are still a holocaust denier. If you deny that Jews were killed because they were Jews, then you are denying the holocaust, and the same holds true for any other groups killed. \"Auschwitz\" engages precisely in type 3 Holocaust Denial.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at the essay.\n\nThe following characterizes the general tone and thesis of the essay:\n\n&gt;A recent leaflet of the M.R.A.P. (Movement against Racism, Anti-semitism and for Peace) attributed to nazism the blame for the death of 50 million human beings, of whom 6 million were Jews. This position identical to the «fascist warmongers» slogan of self-styled communists, is typically Bourgeois. In refusing to see that capitalism itself is the cause of the crises and cataclysms that periodically ravage the globe, the bourgeois ideologues and reformists have always pretended instead to explain them by each other's wickedness. One can see here the fundamental similarity of the ideologies (if one dares say it) of fascism and anti-fascism. Both proclaim that it is thoughts, ideas, the will of human groupings which determine social phenomena.\n\n&gt;Marxism has demonstrated that on the contrary misery, oppression, wars of destruction, far from being anomalies caused through deliberately malevolent wills, are part of the «normal» functioning of capitalism. This is particularly so in the epoch of wars of Imperialism, a theme we will develop further because of the important way in which it bears on our subject: the question of destruction.\n\nThe problem with this section is that its a classic red-herring to which holocaust deniers regularly resort. \"Capitalism has engaged in imperialism and destruction, therefore why should we care about the destruction caused by Fascism?\" In the second place, it's demonstrably untrue - Sure, capitalism has engaged in atrocities, but \"normal capitalism\" has never engaged in the sort of industrialized killings which took place under the Nazi regime. Genocides have taken place before in history, but the holocaust was unique in that it was not a series of haphazard pogroms or military retaliation but a deliberate state policy of mechanical genocide which is unprecedented in efficiency, scope, and demonic energy. \n\nIn any case, the point is that Fascism is clearly different from the normal functioning of capitalism as numerous author, among them Robert Paxton, Roger Eatwell, Roger Griffin, and Stanley Payne have all attested. While the Nazi regime did privatize some state investment and crush unions, it also expanded the state share of the economy and promoted limited economic planning. More importantly though, it completely banned all opposition parties and clamped down on freedoms to dissent - a point that has been recognized by virtually all socialists, that even if such freedoms as elections and opposition are limited in a capitalist society, they still allow an important scope for political action.\n\n&gt; We have shown that the reverse is true; that destruction is the principal aim of the war. The Imperialist rivalries, which are the immediate cause of wars, are themselves only the consequence of ever increasing over-production. Capitalist production is effectively impelled into War because of the fall in the rate of profit and the crisis born of the necessity of continually increasing production whilst remaining unable to dispose of the products. War is the Capitalist solution to the crisis: the massive destruction of people remedies the periodic «overpopulation» which goes hand in hand with overproduction. You would have to be an illuminated petit-bourgeois to believe that imperialist conflicts could be regulated as easily as in a game of cards or in a roundtable, and that this enormous destructiveness and the death of tens of millions of men are through the obstinacy of some, and the evil and greed of others.\n\nWhile  imperialism probably played a fair share in the causes of World War Two, there is no evidence that the war was started as some mechanism to destroy capital and reduce overpopulation so as to improve the economy. This is just conspiracy mongering. The specific cause of the war was the Nazi attempt to expand into Eastern Europe and assert it's dominance against France and the UK. Pure economic concerns had little to do with it.\n\n&gt; The problem can then be cleared up not by trying to explain the «destructive nihilism» of the nazis, but rather why the destruction concentrated itself largely on the Jews. On this point also, nazis and anti-fascists are agreed: It is racism; a hatred of Jews and a ferocious and uncontrollable «passion» that caused the death of the Jews. But, as Marxists, we know that social passions don't have a life of their own, that nothing is more determined than these big movements of collective hatred. We will see that the study of anti-semitism within the imperialist epoch confirms this.\n\nSomehow the killing of the Jews had nothing to do with racism.\n\n&gt;As a result of their previous history, the Jews find themselves today mainly in the middle and petit-bourgeoisie. A class condemned by the irresistable concentration of capital\n\nAnd here we come to the thrust of the essay: the Jews killed not because they were Jews, but because the Jews were petty bourgeois. This is just breathtakingly racist. While Jews owned a disproportionate amount of businesses, most Jews were workers like anyone else - especially so in the former Russian Empire where most of the victims of the Holocaust came from, Jewish poverty was widespread. Jews were not some sort of class in Europe.\n\n&gt;\nGermany between the wars illustrated this. phenomena in a particularly acute form. Shattered by the war and the revolutionary thrust of 1918-28, and menaced at all times by the proletariat, German capitalism suffered deeply from the world crisis after the war. Whereas the stronger victorious bourgeoisies (U.S.A., France, Britain) emerged relatively unscathed and easily got over the «readaption» to the peace economy crisis, German Capitalism was overtaken by a total depression. And it was probably the small and petit-bourgeoisie that suffered most of all, as in all crises which lead to the proletarianisation of the middle classes and to a concentration of capital enabled by the elimination of a proportion of small and medium sized businesses. But in this instance, it was such that the ruined, bankrupted, dispossessed, and liquidated petit- bourgeoisie couldn't even descend into the proletariat, who were themselves affected badly by unemployment (7 million unemployed at the worst point of the crisis); they therefore fell directly into a state of pauperism, condemned to die of starvation when their reserves were gone. It is in reaction to this terrible menace that the petit-bourgeoisies invented «anti- semitism». Not so much, as metaphysicians would have it, to explain the misfortunes that hit them, but rather to preserve themselves by concentrating on one of its groups.\n\nApparently the Jews were so successful that they put all the non-Jews out of business. The problem being that only 1/3 of shopowners in Germany were Jews, and no evidence that Jews were somehow disproportionately successful at staying in business then Germans. \n\n&gt;In Germany, the Jews were the only ones to «fit the bill»: They were almost exclusively petit-bourgeois, and within the petit- bourgeoisie itself they were the only group sufficiently identifiable. It was on them alone that the petit-bourgeoisie could concentrate the catastrophe.\n\nAgain:Apparently Jews were some class of petty bourgeois. Which doesn't even make sense within the frame of Bordiga's own analysis, since why couldn't Germans just kill other Germans then rather then killing Jews? Wouldn't you at least expect a proportionate rate in killing if the motive was class-based and not really racial?\n\n&gt;\nWe haven't said anything about the German proletariat because it didn't intervene directly in this affair. It had been beaten and, take note, the liquidation of the Jews wouldn't be possible until after its defeat. But the social forces that had led to this liquidation existed before the defeat of the proletariat. Its had only allowed these forces to «realise» this liquidation by leaving Capital's hands free.\n\nGerman workers' didn't participate at all in the Holocaust. Which I find pretty doubtful considering 1/3 of all Germans voted for the Nazi Party. Kristallnacht, the boycott of Jewish businesses, never happend I guess.\n\n&gt;Little by little, Jews were deprived of all means of existence, having to live on any reserve they had managed to save. During the whole of this period up to the latter part of the war, the politics of the nazis towards the Jews hung on two words: Juden raus! Jews out! Every means was found to ease Jewish emigration. But if the nazis intended only to throw out the Jews whom they didn't know what to do with, and if the Jews for their part only wanted to leave Germany, nobody else would allow them to enter. And this isn't really so astonishing if one considers that nobody could let them enter: there just weren't any countries capable of absorbing and providing a living to millions of ruined petit-bourgeois, only a tiny fraction had been able to leave, The greater part remained, unfortunately for them and unfortunately for the nazis. Suspended in mid-air as it were.\n\nAh yes, no one could take the Jewish refugees! No one at all! Racism had no part to play in why Jews were denied refugee status, it was apparently entirely due to the need to prevent Petty Bourgeois Jews from stealing our jobs!\n\n&gt; Conditions of life were made harder by the war and the Jewish reserves fell; they were condemned to die of starvation before long.\n\nGermany had enough food to feed the Jews of central europe, the problem was that they wanted central europe to be open land for German colonists and to export food to Germany. The 'starvation' of central europe was deliberately induced by overrequistioning of grain and the ethnic cleansing of areas in Poland to settle Germans. It had nothing to do with the hardships of the war.\n\n&gt;In «normal» times, when it only affects a few, capitalism can leave those people rejected from the production process to perish alone. But in the middle of a war, when it involved millions, this was impossible. Such «disorder» would have paralysed it. It was therefore necessary for capitalism to organise their death.\n\nYeah that's why when Germany was starving in WW1, it executed 100,000 people. Oh wait no, it just let them starve to death instead.\n\n&gt;It didn't kill them straightaway though. To begin with, it took them out of circulation, it regrouped and concentrated them. And it worked them to death. Killing men through work is one of capitalism's oldest tricks. Marx wrote in 1844:\n«to meet with success, industrial competition requires numerous armies that can be concentrated in one place and copiously decimated».\nIt was required of course that these people defray their expenses whilst they were still alive, and of their ensuing deaths. And that they produce surplus-value for as long as possible. For capitalism couldn't execute the men it had condemned - unless it could profit from the very execution itself.\n\nComparing work exploitation to Auschwitz is just stupid, I'm sorry. The first problem is that most Jews weren't sent to labor camps, they were sent to extermination camps in which only a tiny portion lived as Sonderkommando, the majority being executed on arrival, at camps like Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno. This is how most Jews in the Holocaust died, or else they were shot outright by Einsatzkommando. Only a minority were sent to labor camps, which were hardly designed to be profit centers so much as places designed to work people to death. \n\n&gt;\nBut people are very tough. Even when reduced to skeletons, they weren't dying fast enough. It was necessary to massacre those who couldn't work, and then those for whom there was no more need, because the avatars of war had rendered their labour useless.\n\nExcept the problem is that Extermination camps were established and then closed before the labor camps. Concentration camps existed but most Jews weren't sent to them but to Ghettos where they didn't engage in \"labor camp work\" at all, and then sent to Extermination camps. Extermination camps were mostly closed by 1944, while labor camps or labor-extermination camps like Auschwitz and Majdanek continued until the end of the war.\n\n&gt;German capitalism was uncomfortable however with assassination pure and simple, not on humanitarian grounds certainly, but because it got nothing out of it. \n\nSomehow I doubt the Nazi leadership was particularly uncomfortable with the idea of killing Jews. I'm sure for them a world without Jews and Slavs would be reward enough. I mean if they really wanted to profit off of the Holocaust they could have just established slave camps rather then mass killing them.\n\n&gt;In April 1944, Joel Brand was summoned to the Judenkommando in Budapest to meet Eichmann, who was head of the Jewish section of the SS. Eichmann, with the approval of Himmler, charged him, with the following mission: to go to the Anglo-Americans to negotiate the sale of a million Jews. The SS asked in exchange 10,000 lorries, but were ready to bargain, as much on the nature as on the quantity of the merchandise. They proposed as well the freeing of 100,000 Jews - on the official acceptance of the agreement to show good faith. It was a serious business.\n\nWhether or not the Nazis were serious about this proposal is up for debate. In any case they were obviously motivated by desperation as the war was coming to a close rather then trying to scheme some way to get profit out of the Jews, since, you know, they had been mass killing them for the past three years rather then engaging in hostage negotiations.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, if the supply existed, the demand didn't. Not only the Jews, but the SS had been taken in by the humanitarian propaganda of the allies! The allies didn't want these millions of Jews. Not for 10,000 lorries, not for 5,000 not even for none at all.\n\nThe SS was killing the Jews, not out of anti-semitism but because the allies somehow persuaded them the Jews were valuable. Wow.\n\n&gt;The allies didn't want these millions of Jews. Not for 10,000 lorries, not for 5,000 not even for none at all.\n\nYeah I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact the allies thought the Germans were manipulating them for Trucks, and everything to do with fears about Jewish unemployment.\n\n&gt;The SS had been slow to comprehend: they themselves believed in western ideas!\n\nSure. Right.\n\n&gt;v\nJoel Brand had almost grasped the situation. He had understood what the situation was, but not why it was so. It wasn't the Earth that didn't have anymore room, but Capitalist society. And for their part, not because they were Jews, but because rejected from the process of production, useless to production.\n\nYeah, Jews were killed in the holocaust because of them being \"useless for production\", and not because of their ethnicity. Right. I wonder how any of this applies to the 5 million non-Jews killed during the holocaust...\n\n&gt;First of all, there are the imperialists of the allied camp, who used the deaths to justify their war, and following their victory to justify the infamous treatment they inflicted on the Germans. Such as the swooping on the camps and the corpses, walking around everywhere with horrible photos and proclaiming «see what bastards the Boche are! We certainly had good reason to fight them! And how justified we are now to give them a taste of pain!»\n\nYeah those poor German camp guards being punished for war crimes. Just terrible.\n\n&gt;The experiments of the SS doctors are supposed to make the proletariat forget that capitalism experiments on a large scale with carcinogens, the effects of alchohol on heredity, with the radio-activity of the «democratic» bombs. If the lampshades of human skin are put on display, it is in order to make us forget that capitalism has transformed living man into lampshades. The mountains of hair, gold teeth, and bodies of men, become merchandise, are supposed to make us forget that capitalism has made living man into merchandise. It is the work, even the life of man, which capitalism has transformed into merchandise. It is this which is the source of all evils. Using the corpses of the victims of capital to try to bury this truth, to make the corpses serve to protect capital. Surely this must be the most infamous exploitation of all.\n\nYou know, I don't much like capitalism either, but I'm not going to compare it to the holocaust and then conclude that capitalism is worse.\n\n[This forum post can better explain how this essay was subsequently picked up and used as the foundation for left-wing holocaust denial](https://libcom.org/forums/theory/bordigism-anti-fascism-01032012#comment-471119)\n\nBut suffice to say it was then picked up by Left Communists to mean that the genocide was merely a question of body count rather then targeted at a specific ethnicity, because it wouldn't be profitable for capitalists to target a specific ethnicity. Some took it to mean that gas chambers didn't exist because they wouldn't be profitable, so anyone who died must've been simply exploited to death by German capitalism. As has been noted in response to Pierre Guillaume, who did the most to popularize \"Auschwtiz\": \"The politics of Gillaume and other ultra-left Holocaust deniers (including Serge Thion and Paul Rassinier) have been characterized as \"anarcho-Marxist.\" According to Alain Finkielkraut, Gillaume's commitment to Holocaust denial stemmed from his ultra-left politics, rather than from antisemitism. The genocide of the Jews was seen by Gillaume and others as a distraction from class struggle, and as playing into the hands of Zionist and Stalinist ideologies, and was hence denied\". Even Gilles Dauve, the recent darling of the ultra-left, approvingly cited the theses of \"Auschiwtz\" and also that of the other Left-wing holocaust denier Paul Rassinier (although years later he tried to edit these comments out).\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to quote the critical essay appended to \"Auschwitz\" by the translator Mitchell Abidor:\n\n&gt;If all there was to Bordiga’s “Auschwitz, or the Great Alibi” was its mechanistic reduction of Marxism, its denial of human agency in the most horrific of acts, its diminution of the person to a mere conduit for class interests, “Auschwitz, or the Great Alibi” would be merely another betrayal of the richness of Marx’s thought. When we add its callous and cold treatment of the Holocaust as a simple “ejection from the productive process” of millions of humans, its foreshadowing of Jean-Marie Le Pen’s dismissal of the event as a “point of detail” of the Second World War, it attains to odium. And finally, when we take into account its posterity, its use as a basis for the small current of the (primarily French) left that indulged in Holocaust denial, its true horror is laid bare.\n\n&gt;This article has a slightly controversial history, having never been published under Bordiga’s name. It originally appeared, though, in 1960 in a French Bordigist journal, Programme Communiste, and Bordiga himself never spoke out against its theses. And so, echoing the ancients, we will call the author the pseudo-Bordiga.\n\n&gt;The article was published as a pamphlet in 1970 by Pierre Guillaume, former member of Bordiga’s Parti Communist International and of the group around the ultra-left bookstore “La Vieille Taupe.” In a later incarnation La Vieille Taupe was to become the voice of left-wing holocaust denial, and it is in Guillaume’s early affection for this article – which appears on the web not only at marxists.org, but on revisionist websites – that we can see the germ of the movement.\n\n&gt;Indeed, it is an easy step from “Auschwitz or the Great Alibi” to complete denial of the Holocaust.\n\n&gt;The author places Nazis and anti-fascists on the same level, dismissing both for blaming “hatred of the Jews” as the cause for the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism was not the “a priori reason for the destruction” of the Jews; it was nothing but the “expression of [a] desire to limit and concentrate destruction on them.” Their choice as victims was due both to their place in capitalist society and their ease of “identification.” Anti-Semitism is thus nothing but a side issue, one incidental to the discussion. After all, they weren’t killed “because they were Jews, but because they were ejected from the production process.” Two decades of Hitlerite anti-Semitic rants meant nothing. “Der Sturmer” meant nothing. Kristallnacht meant nothing. All we had was capitalism looking for a way out of a crisis.\n\n&gt;From there the author shifts to placing a part of the blame for the death of millions on the West, which didn’t take in the Jews, and his tone makes it clear that it is the greater part of the blame. Stating that “most remained [in Germany], despite themselves and despite the Nazis,” the Reich becomes just an ancillary figure in the drama. Not only did they want to send the Jews elsewhere and not be forced to kill them, it was the West that refused to save them. In one of “The Great Alibi’s” most outrageous enormities, it is the SS that “believed in Western ideals.” In pseudo-Bordiga’s treatment of the negotiations between Joel Brand and Eichmann for the trading of Jews for trucks, it is Eichman and the Germans who are allowed to appear concerned about the Jews, even putting down a “deposit” of Jews in Switzerland preparatory to the final swap.\n\n&gt;And then the pseudo-Bordiga sets loose the final indignity: “German capitalism resigned itself with difficulty to murder pure and simple.” Its hand was apparently forced in the killing of six million Jewish men, women and children. One can almost hear Himmler sighing sadly through pseudo-Bordiga’s prose. And of course, in the Bordigist universe, it was “capitalism” that killed them, not the specific form, German Nazism, and their death wasn’t by Zyklon B or disease or firing squads; it was done by “ejecting them from production.”\n\n&gt;The ignominy of this article never ends: the “imperialists” are guilty of using the deaths of the Jews to “justify...the despicable treatment inflicted on the German people.” In this pseudo-Bordiga is perfectly consistent. No German was responsible for any of the crimes perpetrated; capitalism alone, an abstract entity, was responsible for everything. And in any event, in the final paragraph we are informed that capitalist life is everywhere and in every way a hell. A precise equivalence exists between daily life under capitalism and the death camps, since if the “good democratic anti-fascists... show the lampshades made of human skin, it’s to make us forget that capitalism transforms the living man into a lampshade.” “Shame” seems to have been a word missing from the author’s vocabulary.\n\n&gt;The death camps are rendered banal, the Germans are exculpated, the fate of the Jews demoted to mere happenstance. Denial of the very existence of the Shoah flows naturally from all of this.\n\n**Sources**\n\nWestern Marxism and the Soviet Union, Marcel van der Linden\n\nBloodlands, Timothy Snyder\n\nBlack Earth, Timothy Snyder\n\nComrades, Robert Service\n\nThe Red Flag, David Priestland\n\nThe Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton\n\nA History of Fascism, Stanley Payne\n\nThe Second World War, Antony Beevor\n\nFascism: A History, Roger Eatwell\n\nThe Holocaust, Laurence Rees\n\nTelling Lies About Hitler, Richard Evans\n\nTo Hell and Back, Ian Kershaw\n\nGods Playground, Norman Davies\n\nEurope, Norman Davies\n\nDark Continent, Mark Mazower\n\nForgotten Holocaust, Richard Lukas\n\nWhy did the Heavens Not Darken?, Arno Mayer\n\nThe Lost Revolution, Chris Harman\n\nEDIT: Post is currently being brigaded by salty Left Coms.",

Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/7ev5hb/do_you_think_the_molotov_ribbentrop_pact_is/dq7sl92/)\n\n&gt; the nazis invaded poland first, and like most countries at the time, the nazis faced little to no resistance. poland's government just let the nasiz march in\n\nWhat? Contrary to what most Americans seem to think, Poland (a) fought hard against the Nazis and (b) didn't collaborate with them. They also seem to be implying that Czechoslovakia collaborated with the Nazis to invade themselves just to spite the USSR. \n\nIn any case, Poland had 1 Million Soldiers fighting against 1.5 Million Germans and 50k Slovaks. 200,000 were casualties during the campaign with another 700,000 captured. Germany lost 20,000. As for it being a walkover, the campaign went on for over a month - only ten days shorter then it took for France, Belgium, and the Netherlands to fall. Poland in fact scored some successes, like the defence of the Westerplatte peninsula which held off the Germans for more then a week despite only having 200 soldiers. At Wizna, 700 Polish troops held off 40,000 Germans for three days. At the Battle of Mokra, a Cavalry Brigade, an Infantry Division, and an armored train defeated a Panzer corps and forced them back before being forced to retreat the next day after their position was outflanked. Sure, Poland lost, but it had more to do with the fact they were outnumbered and didn't have a large air force or many tanks then the lack of will or ability. As well, there was the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland which destroyed the ability to regroup in the east of the country. \n\nNot to mention, Polands government actually fled the country and continued the war. if this wasn't enough, I seriously doubt they'd collaborate with a government which executed at least 3 million Polish civilians during the war, and millions more Polish Jews. Before the war the Polish government had actually been approached by the Nazis with a proposal to cede the Danzig corridor and Poznan in exchange for eastern conquests from the USSR, and to join the Anti-Comintern pact and effectively become a German satellite. The Polish government refused.\n\n&gt;\nGood point and really so obvious it is embarrassing to have overlooked it. While we can be critical of Stalin’s treaty we should regard it as that different than any of the other appeasement treaties that happened in the West.\n\nThe problem is that while the West made non-aggression pacts with Germany, the USSR had built a  reputation for opposition to Fascism, so the adoption of a pragmatic policy with Germany was particularly shocking.I guess they're just trying to say the USSR was as bad as all the capitalist states it railed against? As well, none of the other non-aggression pacts with Germany included secret clauses that divided eastern europe.\n\n&gt; to prevent this the soviet rushed to take the rest of poland before the nazis could. the soviets allined themselves with the polish people, most didn't want anything to do with nazis, and in many cases the soviets were welcomed.\n\nCompletely false. The Pact specifically committed the USSR to sending military force into Poland, and the sphere of influence each got was also clearly articulated in the treaty. In some places, German forces actually pulled back to hand over pre-assigned territory to the USSR. It was in no way a spontaneous reaction aimed at grabbing as much territory as possible (as though that would somehow be better). German-Soviet troops even staged a joint victory parade in Brest: \n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-121-0011A-23%2C_Polen%2C_Siegesparade%2C_Guderian%2C_Kriwoschein.jpg \n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Armia_Czerwona%2C_Wehrmacht_22.09.1939_wsp%C3%B3lna_parada.jpg\n\nThey also [rather infamously staged joint NKVD-Gestapo conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo%E2%80%93NKVD_conferences)\n\nAs for the populace welcoming soviet invasion, I find that pretty doubtful since Stalin's purges of Poles were well known at the time. The NKVD's [Polish operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Operation_of_the_NKVD) was the single worst episode of the Great Terror resulting in the execution of 110,000 Soviet Poles, almost entirely on the basis of their ethnicity. Eastern Poland was in fact the region most badly affected by WW2 thanks to the Soviet invasion meaning that Eastern Poland experienced the full force of the Great Terror with mass deportations and executions, then was invaded by the Nazis in 1941, then was again invaded by the USSR in 1944 with even more deportations as Eastern Poland was reannexed by the USSR and distributed to the Belarussian, Ukrainian, and Lithuanian SSRs.\n\nSources\n\nBloodlands, Timothy Snyder\n\nThe Second World War, Antony Beevor\n\nGod's Playground, Norman Davies\n\nTo Hell and Back, Ian Kershaw\n\nBlack Earth, Timothy Snyder\n\nThe Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton\n\nDark Continent, Mark Mazower\n\n",

        "author": "Chamboz",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7f2twy/redditor_develops_bizarre_ideas_about_ottoman/",
        "text": "I came across [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7eu9rz/how_long_would_the_ottoman_empire_have_lasted_if/dq8zber/) today, as part of a thread about late Ottoman history. I want to use it to highlight some aspects of the strange style of thinking that came with adherence to the Ottoman decline thesis of the mid-twentieth century.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it's kind of a \"chicken or egg\" question: did Wahhabism grow because the Ottomans were in decline or did the Ottomans decline because of the growth of Wahhabism - but I think it started with the softening of the Ottomans.\n\n&gt;I'd argue that the decline of the Ottoman will to rule, specifically their shift from the military religious organization of Suleiman to an economic trading organization and the increased internal tolerance for dissidents, disbelievers and heretics made the growth of oppositional movements not just possible but inevitable. Currently, however, it would be fashionable to say that the Ottomans were merely evolving from a military religious order to a secular trading administration and that the Wahhabi schism was a completely unpredictable external event.\n\n&gt;You, like me, think the two were interrelated and that puts us closer to the Decline camp than not, no matter what the consensus among the revisionist sycophants of modern academia is.\n\nA pretty standard critique that modern-day academics direct against the Ottoman decline thesis is that anything and everything in Ottoman history had to be connected to decline in some way. This poster posits two possibilities: either Wahhabism was a result of Ottoman decline, or the Ottomans declined because of Wahhabism. The possibility that Wahhabism was a movement with its own history largely independent of the broader course of the empire’s state and society is not given consideration. When Ottoman history is viewed through the lens of decline, events and processes are denied autonomy; everything is subsumed into the broad narrative of the state’s decay. All roads either lead to, or stem from, the master narrative of decline. This inhibits one’s ability to understand both Wahhabism as a movement, and Ottoman history as a whole.\n\nNow, as for his claims: first of all, it seems odd that this poster simultaneously argues that revisionist historians’ interpretations are wrong, but then adopts (his highly distorted version of) their very framework for his theory. But leaving that aside, this poster also doesn’t have a good grasp of the claims that modern-day historians are actually making when they critique the decline thesis. I can’t figure out from where exactly he gets his ideas, but at least part of it seems to be a serious perversion of the brief summary of modern scholarship given by Jane Hathaway in *The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule*, a quote which anyone who follows my posts has certainly seen before.\n\n&gt; One of the most momentous changes to have occurred in Ottoman studies since the publication of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent [1966] is the deconstruction of the so-called 'Ottoman decline thesis' – that is, the notion that toward the end of the sixteenth century, following the reign of Sultan Suleyman I (1520–66), the empire entered a lengthy decline from which it never truly recovered, despite heroic attempts at westernizing reforms in the nineteenth century. Over the last twenty years or so, as Chapter 4 will point out, historians of the Ottoman Empire have rejected the narrative of decline in favor of one of crisis and adaptation: after weathering a wretched economic and demographic crisis in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman Empire adjusted its character from that of a military conquest state to that of a territorially more stable, bureaucratic state whose chief concern was no longer conquering new territories but extracting revenue from the territories it already controlled while shoring up its image as the bastion of Sunni Islam.\n\nThis quote pertains to the response of the Ottoman Empire to the crisis it experienced at the end of the sixteenth century. The empire began to undergo another unrelated transformation at the end of the eighteenth century, as the old regime gave way to the modernizing reforms of the Tanzimat period, and our poster's description of the reformed Ottoman Empire as \"secular\" makes me think he's conflated the two, a fundamental misunderstanding which would render any deeper rebuttal of his position pointless. I'll simply note that the Wahhabi movement began in the mid-eighteenth century, in the deserts of Arabia where Ottoman authority did not extend. Thus, even if the eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire had actually offered more “internal tolerance for dissidents, disbelievers and heretics,” that wouldn’t have meant much for the Wahhabis, as their influence primarily spread outside of the empire and not within it. It’s hard to see how Wahhabism was a result of the empire’s transformation from a conquest-oriented state to a more bureaucratic administration, a process which was mostly complete a hundred years earlier, and did not really have anything to do with the Ottomans’ attitude toward religion or religious tolerance. The only way this makes sense is by also throwing in bizarre claims about abstract moral concepts like the Ottomans’ “softening” and the decline of their “will to rule,” (common tropes of the old historiography) and also, as mentioned above, by assuming that anything and everything that happens in Ottoman history has to have some kind of connection to this all-consuming, totalizing decline. What if we choose instead to see Wahhabism as just Wahhabism, and the Ottoman state as just the Ottoman state, both dynamic historical phenomena with complex histories, rather than using them as tools in a grand story about the degradation of Islamic society?",

        "text": "To tie in with Reddit's theme of the day, ours is about neutrality that didn't last. Many a country might have desired to remain neutral in conflicts but circumstances pulled them into the conflict one way or another. Whether it's being in the wrong place, being perceived by one of the parties to favour the other, being presented with an offer by one of the parties that they couldn't refuse, or perhaps even because the situation changed and they decided to pick a side to advance their own goals. Alternatively this could be about supposedly neutral countries that only pretended to be so to lull one of the parties into a false sense of security, or any good story you have involving neutral countries and how they became such.\n\nBecause of the 20 year rule you can't discuss the current attempt on net neutrality in the USA, but if you want to, the front page of reddit has a plethora of posts where you can do this. They are also telling you who to contact, how to contact them, and why it is important to do so.\n \nNote: unlike the Monday and Friday megathreads, this thread is *not* free-for-all.

They had no issue stomping through Eastern Europe which used plenty of heavy cavalry, and much like the Arabs and any Empire that gets too big they more or less fell apart to internal struggles.\n\n&gt;\nJapan was literally uplifted to the 20th century by britain, france and the US.\n\nTIL trade = being lifted up.\n\nSome of this is simplification on my part, but his comments were just jaw-droppingly off-base I just had to post it here.",

Many good things happened to science, literature, etc. during such a vast (and hard to define) era. Most people experienced happiness and definitely did not live covered in feces.\n\n&gt; 1000 years ago we were doing quite happily* under Saxon rule for another 49 years before some Frenchies decided to invade and proper fuck shit up.\n\nAs a rule of thumb using a \"we\" when discussing matters 1000 years old seems like automatic badhistory. For instance, I am a Frenchman and this comment made me fart in its general direction. Whether Saxon-ruled areas lived happily under that rule is a question quite subjective in nature and any historically consistent answer would require at least some definitions (\"saxon\", \"area\", \"living\", \"happily\" and \"rule\" might be a start). It is at best dubious to call Will &amp; Co \"some Frenchies\" as French national identity wasn't yet what it later would become and the Normans very much saw themselves as, well, Normans. Not to mention the 1066 conquest didn't \"proper fuck shit up\" as much as change things and provoke an interesting cultural syncretism.\n\n&gt; The previous inhabitants, aka Celts weren't super happy with the situation. Damn that Vortigern!\n\nThe celtic Britons had been under English rule for something like 5 centuries at this point, give or take. Except maybe in the Welsh marchlands I think we have evidence of a rather integrated population by the 11th century.\n\n\nTLDR : AskReddit once again asserts bullshit with an air of insufferable confidence",
