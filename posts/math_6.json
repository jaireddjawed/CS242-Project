        "text": "I have a family member fascinated by the mathematics I describe below, I'm looking for some help to understand the math so that I can talk to them about it. I've got a solid background in geometry and a moderate background (think mid PhD) in PDE - if that helps at all.\n\nFermat's last theorem is true, but let's pretend that a triple x, y, z does exist (i.e. x^p + y^p = z^p) and try to work out what the factors of x, y, z could be. I want to study the equation x^p mod q + y^p mod q = z^p mod q for each integer q.\n \nConsider p=3 and q=2. A little logic shows that two of x, y, z must be odd and one must be even.\nConsider p=3 and q=3. Since 2^3 mod 3 = 2 and as 1 + 1 = 2 it is possible that none of x, y, z is divisible by 3.\nConsider p=3 and q=4. Since 2^3 mod 4 = 0 and 3^3 mod 4 = 3 the possible values of x^p mod q are 0, 1, 3 (similarly for y^p mod q and z^p mod q). We can write down all possible valid equations of the remainders (e.g. 0 + 1= 1). All of the valid equations must contain at least one 0. Thus at least one of x, y, z is divisible by 4 (there are other remainder conditions just like in the q=2 case - but I'm ignoring them now).\nWe can do the same for each q. We compute u^p mod q for all u=0,...,q-1 and then see if there is an equation of the resulting values which doesn't contain 0. If no such equation exists then we add the number to a list of required factors of at least one of x,y,z.\n\nHere's some code to shows exactly what I mean:\n\n    import argparse                                                                            \n    import numpy as np                                                                      \n    import itertools                                                                     \n                                                                                     \n    def checkNumber(number, power):                                                      \n      remainders = np.unique(np.mod(np.power(np.arange(number), power), number))[1:]        \n      combinations = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(remainders, 2)              \n      for i,j in combinations:                                                           \n        if ((i + j) % number) in remainders:                                                \n          return False, (i, j, (i + j) % number)                                         \n      return True, remainders                                                            \n                                                                                     \n    if __name__==\"__main__\":                                                             \n      for number in range(30):                                                              \n        condition, remainders = checkNumber(number, 3)                                   \n        print(\"%d --&gt; %s\"%(number, remainders))                                          \n        if condition:                                                                    \n          print(number) \n\nFor p=3 the code above shows that the list starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 27, 49, 169, 343, 2197... } with no other numbers up to 19999. Since 2 and 7 are in the list but 14 isn't we know that 2 and 7 must be factors of different elements of the triple (x, y, z) (just a cute aside). \n\nFor p=5 the list starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 16, 25, 32, 41, 71, 101, 121, 125, 625, 1331, 1681, 3125, 5041, ...} up to 19999. For p=7 the list starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 29, 32, 64, 71, 113, 128, 491,...} also up to 19999.\n\nAny way, because I've got almost no understanding of number theory I've got some questions. I was hoping that some people here might be able to help. Especially as I'm super naive and these sequences must have been studied hundreds of years ago.\n\n1) If for a given p the sequence is finite we will have a list of all possible factors of any x, y, z that satisfy the Fermat's equation. We can then use this finite list to check if there are any solutions to the equation. As this is an elementary approach to proving Fermat's last theorem I expect this approach to have been studied and ruled out. Does any one have any idea where in the literature I could find articles talking about this approach?\n\n2) OEIS doesn't seem to list these sequences (according to my naive search). Again as this is an elementary approach to Fermat's last theorem the sequences must be well known. Does anyone know of a reference where I could learn more about these sequences (in particular I'd love to see a proof that for each p the sequence is infinite though maybe they are finite?!). Or maybe a better user of OEIS could link the relevant pages (thank you)?\n\n3) The construction I've performed, studying all numbers x^p mod q, is equivalent to looking at equations a + b = c in certain groups (The p power of Z_q I guess?). I expect there to be extensive literature about this (due to the relationship to Fermat's last theorem). What sort of papers am I looking for, key words, author names, text books on this stuff? I'm at a loss and I'd love to read some more about it.\n\n4) Some suggestions on how to optimize the code above would also be great. You know quick algorithms for computing powers, remainders, and combinations that kind of thing. Once I've got a better python prototype I'll code it up in C and let it rip (on my amazingly spec'd machine - for 2015...).\n\nThanks all. I appreciate the effort it takes to read math on Reddit.

So this excludes things like particular values of sums, products, limits, integrals, or any conjectures made from data, like the nth prime ~ n log(n) or the four color theorem, because you can't directly observe all primes or all planar graphs or all decimal digits of the sum to see whether the result is actually true.\n\nThe only example I can think of is e^(œÄ‚àön) being close to an integer for various values of n. We can see this directly, without making any guesses or extrapolating any data. The explanation uses the theory of modular forms, complex multiplication, and class numbers of quadratic fields.\n\nAre there any more examples?",

Now I feel like I'm out of my depth and whenever I try to read my textbooks I make it like a paragraph and then I Just feel like doing literally anything else. I can stay engaged when I'm working on a problem that I atleast understand and have an idea of how to tackle but now I'm at a point where in order to even have a chance of making headway I have to do all of this reading which i think i could do better if I could just stick with it and get back into a groove i would. Like it takes hours for me to get through 3 pages because i can't seem to shut down my laziest impulses. If it's not that then i just feel tired and feel like sleeping away evenings and afternoons. I think I probably work better in the morning but all i want to do is just sleep or mindlessly scroll while in bed.\n\nI feel like i'm at my limit now and should make some sort of serious change like 6 months ago but idk what would actually work. thoughts?",

        "text": "So for those who don't know already, Gregori Perelman is a Russian Mathematician who proved the Poincare conjecture, and subsequently declined the Fields medal and his million dollar Millennium prize because he felt like he didn't deserve it.  \n\nNow, for some background, I'm a phd student interested in geometry, and I'm participating in a seminar run by a postdoc this semester.  \n\nWe met today, and at the end, I was mentioning to him that I'd love to give a talk on Ricci flow at some point, but wasn't sure about what background would be needed, and then I brought up Perelman to him, since he used Ricci flow in his proof.  He then says to me that my (prospective) advisor was a graduate student when Perelman published his proof on the arXiv, and around this time, Perelman led a workshop on Ricci flow and some of his proof ideas at UC Berkley (or the MSRI which is also right there I think).  \n\nAnyways, apparently a good friend/mentor of my advisor (who's now a prof at UCLA I think, and I'll just refer to as \"G\") attended this workshop and had some interesting interactions with Perelman while there.  These are the two stories I heard: \n\n* Right before giving one of his talks, Perelman challenged G to a footrace up a path on the campus of UC Berkley (to where the talk was I guess).  The path was very curvy.  So Perelman, in order to save time, ran up the hill the path was on without staying on the path itself.  He got very wet/muddy in the process, but still gave the talk right afterwards as if nothing happened.  He still lost btw.\n\n* Perelman and G were out on the streets of Berkely when they got mugged.  G gives up his wallet to the mugger.  Perelman, on the other hand, says to him \"What are you doing with your life, doing this??\" without giving the mugger anything.  The mugger ran away after this, so I guess it worked.\n\ntl'dr Gregori Perelman is an absolute gigachad.",
