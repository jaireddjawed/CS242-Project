The other day I didn‚Äòt really have a choice, it was all so messy, and a lot of my colleagues couldn‚Äòt make it, so I had to take care of it. I would‚Äòve never agreed to working that day, if I had known the event is like a bar tour and will go to 3-4am, but then I couldn‚Äòt back out of it, cuz we were already missing people. I then had to work 8-9 hours straight, cuz the people just kept on coming, and it didn‚Äòt stop. There were a bunch of loud noises, blinking lights, and everyone screaming around me, while I had to do math, and talk to people, so I got a panic attack after short time, but had to remain calm on the outside. Now a bunch of money is missing. It for sure wasn‚Äòt all my fault, cuz some other things went wrong, it was the biggest event there ever (which no one expected), and I switched with someone a few times, but my anxiety is going through the roof, and I‚Äòm thinking bout quitting, since I feel like everyone is mad at me now. I told them all, I don‚Äòt wanna do this job, and that I know my concentration will fail, I wish I just called in sick now, cuz all I can think about it how I messed up",

Spoiler: I got nothing done. I‚Äôve been staying up late for god knows how many weeks/months just to barely keep up with deadlines, with some deadlines having been already passed, and have shit grades. It‚Äôs so mentally taxing, and at the rate I‚Äôm going, I feel like I may have to stay back a year. Which I really don‚Äôt want to do. I want to graduate at the same time as my friends.\n\nI really don‚Äôt want to be deadweight to my family, friends, and gf. At the rate I‚Äôm going at, i may become an academic failure. In the the end, what will I be worth? You can only love/like someone so much for their character right? I feel so hopeless at the moment. And I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to make it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I manage to graduate. What‚Äôs the point of graduating if you have shit grades? You most likely won‚Äôt be able to get anywhere good.\n\nI recently went for a psychological assessment for a re-diagnosis so that I could possibly get some exam accommodations for my final exam. I‚Äôve had constant worries that my diagnosis will turn out to be ‚ÄòNo ADHD‚Äô. If that happens, then would I have been lazy this entire time? Would I have been believing something wrong this entire time? Would have my first diagnosis been a false one? Would I have been some lazy, excuses-making, good-for-nothing?\n\nIt‚Äôs not recommended for me to take medication either, I have epilepsy and ADHD meds will lower the seizure thresh hold. Making me more prone to seizures. Staying up late isn‚Äôt good either, as it‚Äôs a big trigger for my epilepsy. I feel like I‚Äôm taking my life for granted with how late I stay up everyday. But it‚Äôs so hard not to do that when you have to dedicate an entire day to work, and make little to no progress.\n\nDoes it even  matter how many people believe in me, or tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay? When at the pace I‚Äôm at, every belief that they have had in me has been disproven, or barely met. I feel so hopeless and every thought I‚Äôve had about the future and myself has been a negative one.\n\nSorry if this post breaks the rules or something, or better fits in the mega thread. Just felt like I needed to get this off my chest or someone to tell me that I‚Äôm going to be okay or something. I don‚Äôt want to burden any of my irls with this.\n\n\n\nUnrelated but: is it me or does Reddit mobile kinda suck? keyboard lags whenever I‚Äôm making a text post.",

Now, I happen to be extremely stressed out by the diagnosis procedure. For example, the day that I wanted to started taking ritalin, I also woke up extremely early for no reason (and I wasn't on ritalin yet, obviously). So is it possible that now the fact that I wake up earlier is related on ritalin in any way? It has been 15 hours since I last took it. I think it is probably the stress?",

I'm seeking treatment for anxiety but it takes 4-6 weeks for the medicine to start working. I kind of just sit around and scroll through social media on my phone in bed. I have no interest in anything, and dont enjoy anything anyways. \n\nI read online that \\~30% of people with Adult ADHD are homeless in the United States. If it werent for my parents, I'd be homeless right now.  I'm wondering if it would be easier to live in Europe, since alot of systems are socialized, you dont have to own a car, and taxes are more straightforward.  The stress of housing, taxes, insurance, etc in the U.S. really gets to me, and I dont even have to pay for it yet.\n\nI'm planning on backpacking the Appalachian Trail starting next month, but I dont know what I'll do after that.  I'm scared to do anything at this point.  Right now I can just hope this medicine works so I can get a clear mind and make good decisions.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I am a 21M and I am a currently on the track to graduate from university, and I will spend another year in graduate school (I'm a cybersecurity major) and probably either decide if I will stay with my family or move out. I also live in a very robust city, so once I do know how to create music the opportunities to perform are quite amble, but I'll get to that later.\n\nThe problem of course, is that I am just starting out, I have a good voice and I would consider myself quite energetic as a person. Yet, I also sustain myself and my job is that I own an online record store. Not only that, I am quite obsessed with just going on my page and scrolling, while also doing nothing really important for hours at a time. On top of that, I don't have social media, and I don't have any crazy familial commitments, so I have so much potential to really focus my dreams and get to work.\n\nHowever, I am so obsessed with vinyl, and online shopping/selling I spend so much time just doing impulsive and repetitive actions that I am quite disgusted from how I am behaving. I do work a bit, but it is nothing I need to spend more than 30 minutes - 1 1/2 hours doing a day. \n\nThe climax of the problem is, I use the remaining 5-6 hours of free time I have in the day (not including eating, chores, and walking), basically just mindlessly scrolling. If I used half of that time daily to really get in on learning music production, I can definitely at least create enough within a year or even the summer to establish myself as an artist, and I really do believe that (else my dreams would feel dead to me).\n\nI rely a bit on my best friend/neighbor who is quite good at music production himself, yet I want to be more reliant on me, as I am still trying to figure out my sound and what my brand will look like. I want to be more efficient, and I don't know how busy I will be after the summer when I may potentially have school projects to work on. The impeding understanding that once I learn music production, that there will be a branch of more things to work on within that field, and then to worry about other things involving my music social media and creativity really edges me. Because of this I guess I get lots of thoughts and worries that I won't be able to achieve my goals, and that the pressure is just going to be a lot. \n\nThis is all, and I don't know how else to conclude other than to ask for any advice or help! I really would appreciate it!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo I'm currently undiagnosed but I suspect I have ADHD as a lot of the major and minor symptoms apply to my life. At the moment, I'm in the process of doing assessments with a healthcare professional to see if I can get diagnosed and the steps I need to take after that to improve my life. \n\nOne thing I'm currently struggling with is my relationship with my girlfriend. We've been together for about 5 months. I spent about a year before that speaking to a lot of different girls and getting to know them, kinda falling in love sometimes but most of them didn't work out. I have a lot of wonderful romantic memories with these people. Some situationships we just drifted away from each other and I was more interested in my current GF that I let those situationships die out. \n\nIt took us a few months to officially get into a relationship. I find it very difficult to make important decisions. I had to choose between a bunch of people who I was dating at the time to be serious about and talk about a relationship and having a future together. I eventually just jumped into the deep end and decided I should be with her. That's fine as a relationship is pretty low risk but marriage is a big commitment that is pretty life changing. Your life will change completely depending on who you marry. \n\nMy girlfriend is everything I've been looking for. She's beautiful, smart, funny, respectful, understanding and silly. She has so many quirks like catchphrases and we have so many great memories together. She scratches part of my brain that no one has ever done before. \n\nWe're both muslim and the ideal situation is that we get married as soon as possible but this is something I'm struggling with as I'm not sure I can commit to her as I'm worried I'll still be thinking and wishing I was with others even when married. \n\nOn paper I'm happy in the relationship but I also can't stop thinking about other girls I used to speak to and wonder what my life would be like if I was with them instead. It's heartbreaking and I can't seem to focus or be satisfied in the relationship I'm in. I'm not bored exactly but I think it'd be more exciting to start a new relationship with someone else.\n\nIt's sadly not a question of just *not* thinking about those previous relationships and focusing just on this current one as I can't turn it off. I daydream a lot about those relationships and if I'd be happier or more satisfied than I am now. \n\nThis is happening across all aspects of my life. I'm a freelancer and I'm more excited by the newest job that comes in than the one I'm currently working on. I was also in a relationship before that for nearly a decade and we broke up a couple of years ago. During that relationship I was also thinking about other people, having crushes, having feelings for people I got close to. So it's not exclusive to just this relationship. The difference however is I'm feeling more negative feelings now and anxiety chest pains. \n\nBack to the relationship, I'm constantly being distracted by my previous situationships, what could have been, what could be, attachments to them and nostalgia for previous dates and moments I shared. I'm in love with my GF but I have these strange anxiety chest pains whenever I think about marriage or even engagement. I'm not 100% certain she's the right person for me even though I love her, I always enjoy being with her and interacting with her, there's nothing to suggest she's wrong for me I just wish I didn't have these overthinking thoughts or chest pains that I can't ignore. \n\nThere a few other people in my life that I think about regularly who I think might be better in looks but worse in personality or connection with me but then again I know if I was with them I'd be in the same exact situation where I would be looking around, getting distracted and thinking about my life with another girl who isn't them. If I was with someone else I'd wanna be back with my GF and when I'm with my GF I wanna be with someone else. \n\nI think if there was another person that I could be 100% happy with and never think about anybody else, I would break up with my GF and try to be with them. However I don't think that person exists and the issues lie with me. \n\nI'm very indecisive and it's eating away at me. I miss the thrill of getting to know someone and dating them in real life but also I love being in a relationship with someone I deeply care about. Me and my GF have been on a lot of wonderful dates together so we're rarely ever bored. The solution isn't to go on more dates etc I'm not sure what the solution is. \n\nMy GF deserves better. It's unfair but I can't help how my brain works. She deserves someone who's certain about her. But I'm trying everything to keep her by seeking help and hopefully find a solution. We talk about breaking up if things don't get better but that's not a solution for me personally as I'll get into another relationship and end up in the same place. \n\nWhat should I consider doing in this situation? and is anyone going through / been through something similar?",

I‚Äôd make the decision to walk in class and behave and by 12:00 I was in the principals office for something. This ideal has taken over many aspects of my life as I‚Äôve grown and I simply want to know, how can I help myself?\n\nI‚Äôm currently 23, a college dropout (failed due to me just not doing work smh) and I‚Äôve planned to get a job for the past 2-3 years. Never have. I‚Äôve been paralyzed by something I don‚Äôt even understand. My parents, whom are supportive, seem to misunderstand me and think I‚Äôm lazy for advantageous reasons. ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll always pick up the slack for you‚Äù. That‚Äôs never been an idea to me. I‚Äôm starting to realize nobody cares, searching for sympathy won‚Äôt help anyhow. \n\nI‚Äôm extremely impulsive, w33d carried me as a coping mechanism for years and I‚Äôve finally quit to be sober minded and capable. I‚Äôve decided to do better for myself and enlist in the Air Force for more structure and discipline, but with that opportunity, ADHD diagnosed is a disqualifier. So no meds, No adderall, just my raw brain and willpower. There are many things I have a desire to do but can‚Äôt get myself up to do them.\n\nWhat is this that I‚Äôm fighting against? How do I better myself? My family is seemingly done with the ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô, and I‚Äôm tarnishing relationships with those I love due to this. How do I repair damages done? I want to take accountability and I want to do great things and great works, but how? How do I beat my brain?\n\nI am the culprit, I take all accountability and I want to fix it. Please help!\n-Tyler",

So based on the advice there, I bought a mg scale to weigh the pills. The Vyvanse 40mg weighed 212mg (+/- a couple mg each time I weighed it), where my Vyvanse 50mg capsules weighed 175mg +/- 3 mg.  The Vyvanse 50mg capsule weights were too uniform to be underdosed at CVS, it had to come that way from the factory. I opened one of my 50mg capsules and it was pretty much completely full of a white powder, which probably doesn't help much.\n\nAny idea on what my next step is? Do I go to CVS? Do I reach out to Takeda? Can I contact the FDA? \n\nI understand maybe the 40mg formula has more filler or something, but I think the fact that I feel less (or no) effect from the 50mg coupled with my testing proving the 50mgs are different than expected provides strong evidence that there is something wrong. And frankly I don't trust drug companies to not underdose, especially when demand skyrocketed during the Adderall shortage.",

        "text": "Hello! I‚Äôm a college student and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I‚Äôve tried a couple different meds in the past couple months, and now I‚Äôm a week into Straterra and am already seeing definite differences. Suddenly I feel much more awake and present, and every night this week I‚Äôve had a hard time putting away my work and going to bed because I‚Äôm so hyperfocused on it. I‚Äôm excited to see the full effects in another week, when my doctor said it will have accumulated enough.\n\nOn the other hand, while it‚Äôs easier for me to get work done, my life is still built out of a precarious tower of shitty habits and dubious coping mechanisms. My room is a mess, and I cannot for the life of me get myself to do the damn dishes; I can never seem to leave on time and always end up 5-10 minutes too late to everything ever; I have zero habits built up regarding healthy eating, sleep, exercise, or self care. All of these things have been consistent problems for as long as I can remember and they have had huge negative effects on my life over the years.\n\nI know that meds aren‚Äôt an instant fix. I know I have to put in the work to re-write my habits. My question is‚Ä¶ how do I go about doing that? Does anyone have any advice on how to break out of patterns I‚Äôve been stuck in for nearly 2 decades? I really want to take advantage of these new meds to try to turn my life around, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start.",

        "text": "Anybody know how I can save money on brand name adderall from Walmart? \n\nThis shortage is so ridiculous! \n\nKind of unrelated but I‚Äôd been going to a small family pharmacy that‚Äôs been the only place that can get generic add but last month they wouldn‚Äôt accept my insurance for it any longer. Apparently the pharmacist had to start paying out of pocket for it from the manufacturer. He charged me $75 for a generic from the one manufacturer I HATE. The small white chalky melt in your mouth pills- I forget the manufacturer name atm but it‚Äôs the only one my pharmacist had on record that I cannot take. Didn‚Äôt tell me they had to get that manufacturers generic last month so I didn‚Äôt find out until I wasted $75 on it. \n\nNow I have a script ready to be filled at Walmart, where they consistently have in stock &gt; 100 brand name pills (why they keep telling me the amount they have, idk! Lol) But the cost is $125. my insurance pays half for name brands (full cost $250). I know that‚Äôs not a terrible price (for 30 30mg XRs) but I‚Äôve been taking 45 mg per day of instant release generic for years and have never paid more than $7 for it. So frustrating. Is it worth paying the money for brand name even though it‚Äôs 15mg less per day? No pharmacy around me has instant release tablets. \n\nI‚Äôve been completely off the medication for 15 days or so now so I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to even fill this brand name script. I‚Äôm barely functioning without it but still feel better than when I took the generic add (chalky white pills). I‚Äôll never take those again and my old pharmacist lost my business after pulling that fast one on me lol.\n\nOn a side note- anyone tried replacing an add script with modafinil??  Hear it‚Äôs much safer and more effective but my psych has never heard of it\n\nSeems like such a scam to make everyone get brand name meds knowing most insurance doesn‚Äôt cover them. I tried the lowest dose of generic Ritalin with awfully dangerous side effects &amp; vyvanse of course is $400 everywhere. Concerta has the same active ingredient as Ritalin so staying away from that one. There are literally no other alternatives! That I know of at least. Did I just get a terrible Ritalin manufacturer orrr?",

        "text": "TL;DR My theory is most hobbies that involve some kind of skill building have an easy mode and a hard mode. I want to identify what falls under both categories for my hobbies so that I can do easy mode for low energy evenings, or hard mode when I'm bored of easy mode. More details below: \n\nI feel like I may have seen this concept years ago somewhere, so hopefully I am not completely plagiarizing (to be fair to me though, I've also arrived at it independently! but feel free to share any videos etc that might have more info on this concept), but I wanted to share this is case it gets the gears turning for other people, that most of my hobbies/activities have an easy component and a difficult component; what I will now refer to as \"easy mode\" and \"hard mode\".\n\nActivities that involve learning skills to be able to do them is what I'm focusing on here. So, some examples:   \nPiano: easy mode is practicing songs I have already learned and am getting pretty good at; hard mode is learning a new song or technique.   \nPainting: easy mode is slopping colours onto the canvas/paper or palette and seeing what happens, or painting very simple shapes focusing on value; hard mode is ..... I'm new to painting, so it's anything else.   \nKnitting: easy mode is making a gauge swatch, or continuing on a simple project I've already started; hard mode is planning/calculating for a new project, actually starting said project, or continuing to work on a complex project. \n\nI won't get into details for every hobby because I have too many (lol). But this is the frame work I'm starting to look at these things with, and, moreover, writing down in a place I will see so that I remember later. \n\nI've arrived at this because I'm starting to realize that I have not been correctly identifying what boredom feels like. I think I thought that boredom was not knowing what I want to do, but I'm starting to understand that what it actually is for me, is not doing something with the right level of engagement/reward for my current energy level. \n\nWhat often happens is at the end of a work day I'm low on mental energy, and I'd like to engage in one of my hobbies but everything feels too hard, so scrolling on my phone becomes the default (sometimes with the excuse that it's \"research\"), and no progress is made, and no satisfaction is gleaned. But now I can sort of give myself permission to engage in a hobby on \"easy mode\", and I'll still get some level of reward from it! \n\nIt also seems like it will work in reverse; if I'm getting distracted while I'm on easy mode, then I am probably bored with easy and need to get into hard mode! \n\nI think I am also onto something when I think about things I see other people engage with that could fall under the category of \"easy mode\" except that the learning curve is either less steep or nil: eg puzzles, sudoku, tetris (Dr Mario for me!). I'm sure there are other examples. \n\nThe next step is how to remind myself of these concepts, haha. Also, a challenge is correctly diagnosing why I feel like I would like to do something but can't get started, meds notwithstanding or wearing off. \n\nBut I'm starting to feel like I've got this!

Many of the symptoms the person described, felt oddly familiar to me. I just shrugged it off, because I thought, that everyone experiences these things.

This is why I haven't told anybody in my life about my suspicion. I don't know how, or even **if** I should talk about it with my parents.
