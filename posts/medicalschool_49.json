Second time (this year) waitlisted. I’m getting defeated and wondering if this process is worth continuing if I don’t get in to a school this year. \n\nFor reference, I went to a very good public school undergrad, studied finance in a prestigious business school while also being premed and for a 3.93 and played D1 soccer for said school. My MCATs were pretty good, but not as good as I want. I also have worked on a research team for 3 years and am published. I’ve volunteered with tons of hospital systems and shadowed countless doctors. I have worked my ass off and feel like I’m a good applicant. All I want is to be a doctor, but I am getting no where. I am not sure I can handle another year of apps. What should I do? Is it worth doing this again?",

Meanwhile lower-ranked schools are pressured by this dynamic to disclose their students’ academic records fully and without hesitation.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that weaker students at top schools “might appear to benefit from this dynamic, but perhaps not if they are an academic mismatch at their chosen residency program.” What does \"academic mismatch\" mean in resident matching? Do you agree that a medical school’s goal for its students “should not simply be to get the best residency program but the best match”?",

I’ve been told that our OB/GYN department chair would be happy to write a letter for anyone applying in the specialty, but I’ve only talked to them a couple times, none of which were in a clinical setting, so I feel like there isn’t much they could genuinely say about my abilities in a letter.\n\nOn the other hand, I am working on a research project with a general surgeon, and I have worked with them as well a few times during my surgery clerkship and I feel they have a good impression of me. They are also known for writing good letters of recommendation.\n\nWould a letter from a general surgeon be looked down upon when applying for OB/GYN aways, even if I think it would be a stronger letter than one from an OB/GYN?

For example, when my partner is telling me about a problem/struggle she has, while I am always willing and happy to listen, I sometimes find myself trying to get to the root issue and finding a \"solution\". Sometimes I need to remind myself that she just wants to vent to me and doesn't need a solution right away.\n\n- I love knowing the \"why\" behind everything. In internal medicine, I loved seeking out answers to clinical problems by looking into pathophysiology. I think this has a lot to do with me not being comfortable with uncertainty. In psychiatry, we don't really know the reasons behind pathology. The mind is incredible but also impossible to decipher.\n\n- I have been told my notes are \"more internal medicine than psych\" (during non-psych rotations). and that I think in a IM style (but also i've been told i'm a good fit for psych).\n\nI worry that in my desire to be in a field where I will feel the most fulfilled and happy with myself, along with finding a speciality that meets my goals of prioritizing lifestyle, I may be trying to fit myself into something that i'm not. I want to do right by my patients, and not someone who just quickly screens for MSIGECAPS, etc. and then prescribes a med. If i'm not going to practice good psychiatry, I don't want to do it. I'm also conscious of the fact that personality types are not necessarily fixed. i.e. just because i think i think a certain way, doesn't mean it's so fixed. I think I can adapt, as can most people. \n\nAny advice from other people who have been told they are suitable for IM/other more solution-oriented, pathophysiology-based specialities, but are also interested in something like psych?",

I could be wrong but I believe he does this numerous times throughout the year as I think I have worked a few of them.\n\nAfter the party we were finishing up (myself and 3 male co-workers) and a guy who attended the party came up and asked my name and if I wanted to go get a drink. LOL. WHAT.... My co-workers the lovely fellows that they are, told him we were going somewhere near by to have coffee. They asked him to join us. He did along with a few others.  He’s a very nice guy, a medical student in Pennsylvania graduating in May. He stayed a few extra days and we met for coffee/lunch a couple of times before he went back to school.\n\nWe have kept in touch, speak on the phone daily (I hate texting so he is out of luck there) and he has plans to come visit mid-February. I really don’t have much experience dating (almost none as I’m quite shy) and really don’t want to get involved in any kind of long distance thing.  \n\n**I am staying here in this city as I have a job lined up and will be starting in July.**  \n\nHe told me if he “matches” he will most likely move here. \n\nCan someone explain a few things: \n\nIs it normal for someone who is a senior in medical school to have a lot of free time from January until graduation? \n\nWhat are rankings?\n\n What is a match or match day? \n\nWhat exactly is an intern and/or resident? \n\nI’m just a computer nerd and I have no clue about the medical field whatsoever. \n\nThanks!",

I am someone who wants to be able to do a little bit of everything so I was thinking FM/EM/IM but I really loved my peds rotation. Haven't finished all rotations yet, but ugh I'm so torn. A few things: my grades are pretty good, no research experience (working on case reports and posters atm), a good amount of extracurriculars so I'm not sure where that places me in terms of competitiveness. Just want to know how people went about figuring it out; everything is moving so fast its making me nuts lol. Thanks in advance :)",
