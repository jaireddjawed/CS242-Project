        "text": "Hi All, \n\nI wanted to discuss the Alpha Course with you all today and get your thoughts. \n\nAlpha, for those who do not know, is a worldwide Christian organisation that teaches people about the basics of Christianity. The courses are often held in the evening in churches, prisons and houses and lasts about eleven weeks. During each session there is food and a talk in video form. Then, we get a chance to go off in smaller groups and discuss the talk. All sessions are free and each one lasts approximately 3 hours. \n\nI have been to Alpha at one of the churches in my city. I had been wanting to go for years, so when a Christian friend invited me I was so excited to go! \n\nI got there and everyone was very welcoming. The food was delicious and the vicars said they were very impressed with my knowledge of Christianity that I had picked up from my college course and books. My specific Alpha course is run by the vicar of the church, the curate, and two young male theology students who are training to be vicars. \n\nAlpha discusses topics such as:\n\n1. Who is Jesus?\n2. Why Did Jesus Die?\n3. How Can I Have Faith?\n4. Why and How Do I Pray?\n5. How and Why Should I read the Bible?\n6. How Does God guide us?\n7. Information About The Holy Spirit (covered in a longer session at the weekend)\n8. How Can I Make The Most Of The Rest Of My Life?\n9. Does God Heal Today?\n10. How Can I Resist Evil?\n\nI really love Alpha, especially the casual conversations we have while we eat together. After we have eaten the food, someone gets invited to share their testimony.  But, I couldn't help but realise that the video is very long and by the time it has finished we don't have time to ask many difficult theological and philosophical questions. Why do you think this is exactly?  After the talk is over, the vicar asks if anyone needs prayer for the week and we pray together (I usually don't, but sit quietly and listen). \n\nMy mother says that the purpose of Alpha is to convert you to Christianity. I wonder why she thinks this? She has attended with me as my carer (I have many disabilities and cannot attend independently) and says the course is designed in a very specific way to encourage you to become Christian. I disagree, I think it is an opportunity to have a short discussion and learn about Christianity from a Christian perspective. I wonder why she is so sure it's about converting people? The website states it is evangelistic in nature, but my mother has not read the website, and she claimed to know it was about conversion before she even went. \n\nNow, I have studied evangelism as part of my course in college. Evangelism was explained to us as \"talking to people about Christianity and Jesus\", not about gaining converts. I wonder why my mother thinks that it's so obvious they are trying to convert you? The videos don't even make good arguments and neither do the vicars. (although they are fun to talk to). What do you think? Is the goal of Alpha to convert you? If you think this, why do you. think this?\n\nWhat are your experiences if any with Alpha? Have you been to anything similar? \n\nPS: Alpha is extracurricular and **separate from** my course at college.",

        "text": "**I wanted to announce that the new sub /r/OpenBible is now live.** I recognise that this may not be for everyone here. But we would be delighted to welcome in friendship anyone who has any interest in reading the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, whether you’re interested in finding out about our faith, you want to read it as literature, or you have questions you’d like to ask a progressive Christian community, all are welcome. \n\nWhile we are intentionally a Progressive Christian sub, we will welcome everyone who wishes to join our discussions from any faith (or none), as we have a policy of mutual respect and politeness to all. As Progressives, the sub is firmly LGBTQ+ Affirming, pro-feminist, anti-racist, and egalitarian.\n\nWe will also be scheduling regular Bible readings, working through a Lectionary week-by-week, so that we cover the entire Bible in two years. \n\nSome people may only be interested in the readings and discussions for the Hebrew Bible, but some may also be interested to see what the Christian ‘New Testament’ is all about. You may be interested in simply lurking and reading the passages for yourselves, and you’re welcome to do so. But if anyone is interested in participating, you are very welcome to post. \n\n**Weekly Reading Competition**\nIn addition, /r/OpenBible has an ongoing competition for anyone who is interested enough to post at least *one* comment (however brief) on the regular Saturday and Sunday **Weekly Readings** from the Lectionary. There will be one post every Saturday, with the Readings from the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and a second on Sundays, with the New Testament Readings. For the next 12 weeks (starting on the 12^th /13^th Nov), this will make 24 posts in total. \n\nHowever, if anyone wishes to only post on the Saturday Readings, please let me know and this can be arranged.\n\nThere's no penalty for not managing to post on all of these, but if you do succeed then you'll win a spiffy **Custom Flair** in perpetuity, announcing for all time that you're an \"Original Member\" of the sub (plus any other wording you'd like). If this sounds like an attractive ~~bribe~~ prize then please look out for the first Reading this Saturday and make sure to post your first comment. \n\n**And if you message the mods directly we can add your Custom Flair right now so you can try it out. **\n\nI am really excited about this and I hope you find /r/OpenBible useful, educational, and inspirational.",

        "text": "From his address \"Truth and History\" given at the University of Sofia, Bulgaria, November 14, 2007.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ancient Greeks developed three forms of history, identified with three great historians. Herodotus, who is also considered the father of history, introduced \"narrative history\" as a literary form, a record of the establishment of cities and the sequence of genealogies. Thucydides was concerned with \"political history\" as a way of discerning the causes of events, which are interpreted in light of the universal human spirit. Polybius was especially interested in \"pragmatic history\" as a way of examining popular customs and laws as well as religious and social sturctures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(...) Now, as a hierarch and leader in the Orthodox Church, may we be permitted to say a little about ecclesiastical history, which has certain unique characteristics. First, as Orthodox clergy, we speak of \"sacred history\" inasmuch as this relates to our faith. We believe that human life and history are not directed by invisible or indefinite forces; we are not victims of fate or chance or even of some mechanistic determinism. Rather, it is God who personally directs our life and history. In the Orthodox Church, we do not believe in the phrase \"In the beginning, there was an idea\" or \"In the beginning, there was matter.\" Instead, we believe and declare that \"In the beginning was the Word\"—that is, the hypostatic, or Trinitarian, God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Accordingly, God directs and supervises history through His divine and uncreated energies. Moreover, in these latter days, the Word of God became human, assumed flesh, taught, suffered, was crucified, arose, and ascended into heaven. In the Orthodox Church, there is no contrast between \"the Christ of faith\" and \"the Christ of history.\" The Christ in whom we believe and are saved entered history in order to transform it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so Christ is revealed in history; the kingdom of God is manifest in history; and adoption in Christ takes place within history In this way, \"sacred history\" is identified with \"salvation history.\" This means, among other things, that the interpretation of the holy Bible and of ecclesiastical texts does not occur outside of history; these are not perceived as a code of divine commands. Rather, interpretation of them occurs within history, through the Church, as an expression of divine love for the *transformation* of history. In other words, the Church moves within history and not outside of history. The church lives in historical time and space; it embraces humanity within history and its diverse problems, transforming and sanctifying both time and space while at the same time sanctifying humanity within a particular age and place. And so the Church is not characterized by manicheistic or monophysitic tendencies. For it sees humanity in its entirety, as compromising both body and soul while at the same time facing numerous problems arising from the mortality and corruption of this life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, in the Orthodox Church, the concept of time is not defined as cyclical or repetitive, as it was in classical Greek thought. Nor is it understood in linear fashion, as being directed toward the end of history and the experience of the heavenly kingdom, as in Hebrew theology. Rather, it is distinguished by the cruciform concept of time, by time in light of the Cross, whereby the kingdom of God approaches us as we live in history and time while at the same time we await the completion of the kingdom in the future. In order to appreciate this cruciform concept of time, we might take the example of the conch (or sea shell), which makes both a circular and a forwrd movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe experience of \"sacred history\" leads to the \"theology of reality,\" which is none other than the experience of the heavenly kingdom in specific human lives expressed through words and actions. When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the divine commandments; when St. Paul ascended the third heaven and \"heard ineffable words, which no human words can utter\" (2 Corinthians 12:4); when those who have acquired deification through the ages—prophets, Apostles, Fathers, saints, righteous, confessors, ascetics—ascend to divine vision and know God \"face to face,\" they all behold the uncreated light, the light and brilliance of the transfigured Lord; then, whatever these people write and enact constitutes the *theology of reality*. All of the written texts of the Fathers and of the local and ecumenical synods, the liturgical sources as well as the saints' relics—these constitute the \"theology of reality.\" One cannot be a Christian if one is dissociated from history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(...) Furthermore, \"sacred history\" and the \"theology of reality\" are not only closely interrelated by the all-encompassing circle of time and space; they are also experienced beyond space and time, without at the same time abolishing history. We are speaking here of \"eschatological history.\" For the Church Fathers, history (as time and space) is transcended but not abolished. In the Orthodox Church, we do not speak of the end of history but of its transcendence to a higher plane of perfection. This means that Christ, who assumed human flesh at His incarnation, preserves and deifies this to the ages. Therefore, the body of the risen Christ exists eternally; and, since every human body will rise and the saints will live in paradise, both in body and in soul, history too will never cease to exist. The body of Christ is an indispensable part of history, and the sanctified body of its faithful is a historical reality. And so, the relics of the saints (...) imply that history is not abolished but instead transformed, being elevated to a higher plane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this way, the terms \"sacred history,\" \"theology of reality,\" and \"eschatological history\" contain the entire theology of the Church concerning historical *being* and historical *becoming*.",

I am very worried by the news that the government of the United States is studying a form of abetting the arming of EI Salvador by sending military teams and advisors to \"train three Salvadoran batallions in logistics, communications and intelligence.\" If this information from the newspapers is correct, the contribution of your government, instead of promoting greater justice and peace in EI Salvador, will without doubt sharpen the injustice and repression against the organizations of the people who repeatedly have been struggling to gain respect for their most fundamental human rights....political power is in the hands of the unscrupulous military who only know how to repress the people and promote the interests of the Salvadoran oligarchy. For this reason, given that as a Salvadoran and as archbishop of the Archdiocese of San Salvador I have an obligation to see that faith and justice reign in my country, I ask you, if you truly want to defend human rights, to prohibit the giving of this military aid to the Salvadoran government. Guarantee that your government will not intervene directly or indirectly with military, economic, diplomatic or other pressures to determine the destiny of the Salvadoran people. It would be unjust and deplorable if the intrusion of foreign powers were to frustrate the Salvadoran people, were to repress them and block their autonomous decisions about the economic and political path that our country ought to follow. It would violate a right which we Latin American bishops meeting in Puebla publicly recognized when we said: \"The legitimate self-determination of our people that permits them to organize according to their own genius and the march of their history and to cooperate in a new international order***.\\*\\*\"(Letter to Jimmy Carter, 1980)\n\nOscar Romero along with Martin Luther King Jr and Desmond Tutu are 3 of my favourite Christian activists of the 20th century, and I like to post about him a lot. So who was Romero? And what's the context of the lengthy quotes I posted above? He was the Catholic Archbishop of El Salvador in the 1970s and now a saint in the Catholic Church. Because of his popularity even though he is a Catholic saint he is also venerated in other Christian denominations. In the Church of England's wall at Westminister Abbey he is listed as one of the 20th century martyrs. He was Archbishop of El Salvador at a time of conjoining events in the history of his nation, Latin America and the Catholic Church.\n\nIn Latin America at the time the politics of the Cold War is playing out. Because of the worry of Soviet expansion as well as the legacy of the Cuban Revolution, the United States government seeks to contain any possible communist turn as well as the expansion of the Cuban revolution's influence. So in an effort to \"contain\" communism the U.S both backed and initiated coups in a series of countries that bring into power a wave of right wing repressive dictatorships. Along with this the U.S military forms an organisation called the \"School of the Americas\" who's goal is to \"train\" anti communist forces in the region. In practices this meant training right wing death squads as well as future dictators in the region. The genocidal death squads of Guatemala as well as Efrain Montt, the dictators who presided over the Guatemalan genocide were trained in the School of the Americas. Manuel Noriega, the dictator of Panama, graduated from the School of the Americas. Many of the generals and intelligence officers of the repressive regimes in Chile and Argentina, trained in the School of the Americas. And in El Salvador, Romero's nation, the dictatorship and the death squads their are trained by the school of the Americas. They would proceed to murder up to 75,000 people. This was a policy that the United States adopted in the region in the 60s and 70s, especially during the Nixon, Ford and Kissinger era where strategic interest was placed above human rights. Jimmy Carter and the Democrats in 76 ran on a promise of promoting human rights and a change in America's position on this issue. He would end up having mixed results in implementing his promise. Carter suspended military aid to the repressive regimes of Chile and Argentina for instance and helped evacuate\n\nWhile this is happening in the Catholic Church in Latin America because of the impact of Vatican II was being influenced by the theology of Liberation. Beginning in the Medellin Conference of 1968 and then being crystallised in 1971 when Indigenous Catholic priest from Peru Fr Gustavo Gutierrez publishes a book called \"A Theology of liberation.\". It states that the Church must centre its teaching of solidarity and the Preferential Option of the Poor. In the context of Latin America this mean for many priests challenging unjust capitalism, authoritarianism, and what they saw as the imperialistic politics of the U.S government. Because of this many Catholic priests and bishops ended up becoming leaders in the defense of human rights and social justice as well as movements in the Catholic Church formed around this. In Brazil for instance, you had a military dictatorship brought in power through a coup that was planned by President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy and executed after his assassination by Lyndon B Johnson. The dictatorship cracked down on dissent and the rights of indigenous people. Through the activism of clerics such as Dom Helder Camara, Leonardo Boff, and Frei Betto as well as what are called the Catholic Base Communities, you had grassroots organised resistance which led to an end to the dictatorship in the 80s as well as the enshrining of indigenous rights in the 1988 constitution. In Guatemala when the genocide was happening that killed 200,000 indigenous people priests, nuns and base community leaders led the resistance to it, leading to their murder as well. What motivated all of this was their reading of Biblical narratives such as Exodus where God sides with the oppressed and liberates them. In the same way the priests and base community leaders saw themselves as needing to organise a New Exodus against the modern day Pharaohs that presided over the authoritarian political and economic structures they were combating.\n\nAll of this is the context for Romero. He becomes Archbishop of El Salvador in 1977. He is initially strictly traditional cleric who does not believe Church leaders should be involved in social action. However through the influence of his friend and ally Rutillio Grande, who would end up dying at the hands of the regime he evolves his perspective. He uses his sermons in his Cathedrals as a bully pulpit to rally concern for human rights, drawing inspiration from Christ and the Biblical prophets. The Salvadorean military and its death squad allies, in a civil war with Marxist fighters, end up launching extermination campaigns in peasant communities that included the weaponisation of sexual violence as well as the targeting of children and infants such as hacking them to pieces with machetes in front of their parents and community as a form of psychological terror. Romero would document these abuses through the human rights groups he helped form and they would send these reports internationally which would be taken up by Amnesty International as well as the United Nations. This bring Romero into the international lime light. Romero's sermons would also go on radio broadcast which would be listen to by rural peasant and indigenous community both in El Salvador and eventually throughout all of Central America and would draw inspiration to fight for their rights. As a result the regime seeks to shut him down. First they send the airforce to bomb his radio stations so they would broadcast. He would personally go out and fix the broadcasting systems himself by hand despite the threat of another air raid. Then they imprisoned him, placed him in solitary confinement, and had him face electric shock. He would come out and still preach his sermons. Then the military took over the Cathedral saying its being ran by \"communists\" and turned it into a barracks. Through the support of the people, peasants, workers and indigenous communities Romero seizes back control of the Cathedral through civil disobedience, risking execution by the soldiers under the image of the crucifix. Romero would then tell the following of peasants and workers that just as Christ was crucified on Calvary 50 years ago, he is present and crucified in you today. Essentially they are in Christ and Christ is in them.\n\nIts in this context Romero would give both his appeal to the military and to President Carter. He is stating to the army that God's law and demand for justice is a higher principle they must follow rather than the orders of the dictatorship. And he is also telling president Carter to fulfill his own promises and uphold human rights consistently across the board as well as Carter's own religious sentiment. Unfortunately Carter did not suspend military aid to the dictatorship like he did in other cases such as Chile and Argentina. Romero, because of the risks he took, would end up being assassinated by the vicious death squad leaders. It would take the murder of 4 nuns who's bodies where then thrown in mass graves for Carter to finally suspend aid to the regime. And he did it in the last 2 months of his presidency after the 1980 election. A decision that would be reversed by the incoming Reagan administration. Oscar Romero of course would go on to be recognised by the U.N for his human rights activism and canonised as a saint in 2018 by his fellow Latin American Pope Francis.",

        "text": "\"We are the gods of the atoms that make up ourselves, but we are also the atoms of the gods that make up the universe. - Manly P. Hall\nThe number 666 relates to the carbon atom, and man. Carbon-12; one of 5 elements in the human DNA is composed of 6 protons, 6 electrons and 6 neutrons, which equates to 666. Carbon-12 is the most abundant of the two stable isotopes of the element carbon, accounting for 98.89% of carbon. Its abundance is due to the Triple-alpha process by which it is created in stars, and as Carl Sagan had once said, “we’re made of star stuff.\" When the 666 of Carbon is combined with the elements above and mixed with Lucifer, AKA Phosp-Horus, we get a combination or reaction of chemical elements that forms DNA and RNA. This magical god given chemical-code carrier is the very code for all life, and of course, it is the number of a man; his number is 6 neutrons, 6 protons, and 6 electrons, Six hundred threescore and six (666). Various chemical elements when combined with Carbon, forms our very material reality, or what some may call, the Matrix. \n666 could represent many possible scenarios or conspiracies, but the truth is that this number was passed down to us for the Apocalypse (unveiling of something hidden), to help us identify this beast man with the mathematical number 666. The number 666 may be the sequence of DNA genetic signals or DNA fragments necessary for successful cloning. Yes my friends, YOU and I may be the very beasts and Antichrists our good friend Saint John was warning us about! Research deeper and evolve with Ethics, Morals &amp; Principles to become a spiritual and upgraded HUMAN WITH LIGHT &amp; LOVE.\"\n\nOpinions? Makes a lot of sense to me.",

How there are thousands upon thousands of different religions spanning time and culture. How many of them have rules that are questionable/horrific in our more modern tastes. How people just pick and choose certain aspects of religion and ignore the more upsetting things not to their taste. How there is no objective and obvious true logical path in life for EVERY human being to follow and be comforted by. No consensus. No objective certainty. No undeniable proof of a soul and an afterlife apart from personal testimonials. In analyzing faith and the world around me, I had lost any hope of having faith. I don't want to be an atheist. It genuinely is horrifying. The worst part is having various people angrily confront you saying you are wrong. How can anyone be beyond sure of life when it throws so many variables at you? I feel trapped. Trapped in a body I hate that is decaying slowly through time. Fearing the loss of more loved ones and realizing I am not special in an ocean of 8 billion human beings.

        "text": "\nMe (21)M and my gf (20)F have been dating for 3 years now, since senior year of high school. We are both now soon to finish our 4 year at university and things have been getting serious. I love her very much as she loves me and I’m almost certain I would want to be married in the future possibly in a couple years but not earlier than the age of about 25 or 26. Near the time of us dating for two years we somehow got into the conversation of what we would want our future spouses (whether that be each other or other people) would want. She started listing stuff off such as not always playing games and spending time with kids, then she mentioned she wants them to go to church. I was raised Christian but as I turned 16 I completely moved out of my faith and became agnostic for personal reasons I won’t explain in order to not start an argument in the comments. She knew this whenever we started dating at about 17 years old, I would always talk about how much I disagreed with the religion. She back then had never said anything until one day I asked her ab it and she said she was Christian. So I stopped saying things that could be considered insulting to the religion and it didn’t matter at all to me she was Christian because our ideology was the same and we got along very well. However during this conversation about two year later she mentioned she would want her future husband to be Christian after stating she wanted them to go to church. I have no problem attending church as I love studying religion and philosophy and it’s what I do in my free time. But after she said this my heart sank to the bottom of my chest. I kind of teared up and asked her what she meant. Why she had been dating me for two years and never even mentioned this or why she had even gotten with me if this was a standard and how unfair and somewhat disrespectful it was to me. I was genuinely upset. Not about the standard but about how she went two years only to say it just now after we both decided we loved eachother. We took a week to think about it and came to some sort of compromise. I would try and see her perspective and perhaps embrace it at times and she would try to do that for me. This all took me completely by surprise as my girlfriend is not a very religious type. She let me insult the religion many times before saying anything, underage drank, smoked frequently, and we have sex regularly since we were 17. She has never ever mentioned religion to me once and doesn’t like to talk about religion in the 3 years we’ve been dating. She even makes fun of people that take religion to the extreme. So I was surprised by this standard to say the least. Especially if I’m the one that has the problem with her religion but willing to compromise. And she has no problem with mine but is a little bit more strict. We have not talked about it since. But i still think about it and my heart drops. I love this girl very very much and we have barely ever argued in the years we’ve been dating. But I’m not sure what to do. The only problem is that I do not completely want to raise my kids and indoctrinate them into a Christian lifestyle from birth. I feel it is completely wrong and it’s one thing I hate about Christianity. Let kids grow up to an age where they are able to understand while also teaching them good morals and that u need to be kind with others because it is the right thing to do. Not just because u have to just because god says. I would rather wait till they are in at least 3rd or 4th grade to try and let my wife try and explain this to them. I’m not exactly sure her stance on this but I’m willing to come to compromise because I love her. But I just feel stuck and I need advice really badly. Sorry this was a long read but if you made it to the end I appreciate you so much and will enjoy any feedback you have to offer :)",
