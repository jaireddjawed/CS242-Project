        "text": "I happened upon the wikipedia entry on Japanese phonology, and there for the first time I learned that a lot of sounds that I thought were phonemic in Japanese, such as /f/ or /ts/, are (to my current understanding) merely allophones. For instance, the syllables arising from /t/ are romanised as &lt;ta tsu chi te to&gt; but I hadn't previously realised that the phonetic sequences represented by &lt;tsa&gt; or &lt;che&gt; are not allowed phonotactically, although in retrospect it does make sense. \n\nSo, why is this allophony reflected in the romanised orthography? Is it perhaps not fully considered allophony even though there are no minimal pairs? On that wikipedia page a lot of these seeming allophones are marked on the phonemic inventory with parethneses. \n\nI should also note that here my assumption is that an 'ideal' orthography would be phonemic, not phonetic. In practice many (if not most?) orthographies are etymological, but a romanisation of another writing system would obviously have the liberty to transcend etymology, and so I am surprised that Japanese romanisation chooses to reflect (some) allophony.",

I am a student working my Master thesis, which is a corpus linguistic comparative analysis of the European media discourse around the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis and 2022 Ukrainian refugee crisis.\n\nI will be using Post-Colonial Critical Analysis and an orientalist framework to compare the language and framing - looking specifically for the extent to which each groups is humanised/dehumanised, 'us' or 'othered'. My paper is concerned solely with the European discourse on both subjects, and the EU response to both refugee flows. In order to analyse the data, I will use corpus linguistic analysis.\n\nSpecifically, my thesis will use archived and current data from the 'Euronews' website, and specifically all articles related to:\n\n\\- The '2015 Syrian Refugee Crisis' - Covering a period of one year January to December 2015. The key search term being 'Syrian Refugee'.\n\n\\- The 'Ukrainian Refugee Crisis' - Covering a period from late February 2022 - to date.\n\nI have never done corpus linguistic analysis before, nor do I have much experience at all with handling data/coding etc. So my questions are: 1) do you have any advice on where and how I can access this data at student friendly rates (or free); 2) Can I use OpenRefine rather than Python to process and clean the data, 3) If anyone has any advice on how to code it and do all that techy stuff - please let me know. My thesis advisor has ghosted me and my university is incredibly unhelpful. HUGE thank you in advance.",

I played with many neighborhoods kids who’d only speak French with me and somehow developed friendships despite the language barriers. \n\nAt age 5 I moved to a bilingual city but had to study French every day for 1-2 hours until I finished high school. \n\nAt age 10 I was put in a Japanese language weekend school where I spent 4 hours there every Saturday. \n\nWhen I began school, from age 6-10 teachers didn’t believe I knew English and would ask me if “I was sure” that I knew English and spoke English with my family. Teachers kept insisting English must be my second language but it wasn’t and I would just keep telling them it wasn’t. It took 4 years until teachers stopped asking if English was my first language \n\n But now I’m an adult and I still get these comments, from friends, from people I’ve just met. Recently in France in the summer everyone told my I had a slight Japanese accent when I spoke French and this would come unprompted with 0 warning , I was shocked the first time someone said it to me but by the 5th I just accepted that’s what people think.",

        "text": "The backstory is the Bronze Age Greeks are a big mystery. Archeology finds were given placeholder names including Mycenaeans and Minoans, but they're all one and the same with the people later Greek writers called the Acheaens. An important note is the Greeks do not call themselves Greek, but Hellenes. Hellenes comes from the term Children of Hellen, after the legendary founder of the Bronze Age Greek state.\n\nNow there was an event which at the time was called the Great Dorian Migration, but nowadays is called the Bronze Age Collapse. Part of that involves Greece emptying much of its population and joining a migrant caravan going along the coast of the Meditteranean. The Egyptians called this an \"invasion\" by the \"Sea Peoples\" who made \"a conspiracy in their islands\" to steal land and lists a bunch of islands where the alleged invaders are known to have hailed from.\n\nThere is reason to believe \"Sea People\" is just the literal translation of Acheaen:\n\n1. Aeg- = Waves\n2. \\-an = The Greek demonym\n3. Aegean = The Sea (probably)\n4. Acheaen = Sea People (probably)\n\nIt matches what we know of the Acheaens too. Their capital and main city was Knossos in Crete and most of the sites we find are only a few miles from the coast. And after the Dorian migration, the Sea Peoples became known as the Phoenicians, strangely named after a random town in Greece. The Phoenicians were sailor peoples (plural deliberate) who lived in coastal towns and were a mix of ethnic Greek and whatever local population happened to be nearby.",

I think it’s possibly a method people are using to refrain from offending people with their opinions. The tonality of using the “for me” qualifier dilutes their opinion, removing the “punch” from it, making it almost impossible to be angry at the person. \nExample: “football is boring” versus “For me, football is boring.”\nThe first is a statement delivered as a fact while the latter is qualified, diluted, and made inoffensive.",

Or will they always be a part of the language as long as they serve their purpose?\n\nTo me, it seems that a word will exist as long as there is a context for it to be used. But does this mean that, hypothetically, in 400 years the same word could still exist even if its use was practically non-existent?\n\nI guess what I am trying to figure out is when does a word become obsolete, and how this relates to specialized terminology that isn’t present in common language and is even scarcely used within a field.

As far as I can tell, English doesn't seem to have an indefinite article for plural nouns. \n\nThe definite article \"the\" can be used before both singular and plural nouns (e.g. \"the cat\" and \"the cats\"). But the indefinite articles \"a\" and \"an\" can only be used before a singular noun (e.g. \"a cat\" but not \"a cats\"). Instead, phrases like \"a group of\" or \"a bunch of\" are used before plural nouns (e.g. \"a group of cats\"). The word \"some\" is used in this capacity (e.g. \"some cats\"), but it doesn't seem to be a perfect substitution (I can't say exactly why) for a true indefinite article for plural nouns. \n\nThe only other language I have some experience with is Spanish. If I recall correctly, Spanish has the indefinite articles \"unos\" and \"unas\" which are used before plural nouns. \n\nSo, that's one language with an indefinite article for plural nouns and one without. Which is more common among all natural languages? Has there ever been attempts to introduce an indefinite article for plural nouns into English? What's the explanation for English's lack of one?\n\nThanks in advance for the replies.",

        "text": "I work for a tech insurance company, so I hear Indians say \"vehicle\" a lot. There are a couple ways, but the most common pronunciation is \"wakle\" like wake and able combined into one syllable. There's a two syllable variant as well. They also pronounce the letter \"H\" as \"hayshe\". A number of other little quirks of pronunciation exist, but none are coming to mind right now.\n\nThese don't sound like British English to me, but I'm not British. I have heard British English say \"haytche\" with a hard tch, where Indians have a soft \"sh\" sound.",

        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

        "text": "Here's a bit of a niche \"shower thought\". I've already posted a different version of this (with elementary linguistics explanations y'all probably don't need) under r/musictheory. Now, this might not make sense to those of you who aren't familiar at all with Western music theory, but I tried to keep  it as simple as I could.\n\nIn many musical traditions (Western, Turkish, Greek, Arabic, etc) the degrees of a scale can be raised or lowered depending on the directionality of the melody. In other words, if we have a 7-note scale sometimes one of the notes wants to go up if the melody goes up, and vice versa. Moreover, in said musical traditions the intervals between notes in scales cannot be arbitrary and are governed by certain 'rules'. Basically, the distance between notes can be only so small or large, and consecutive notes can't be consistently at the smallest or the largest allowed distance.\n\nAt this point you might see where this is going.\n\nMy thought was that the degrees of a musical scale are its phonemes and some of these phonemes can exhibit allophonic features and, furthermore, the way allophony is expressed follows the \"phonotactics\" of the musical culture the scale belongs to. A great (and easy) example of this analogy is the melodic minor scale. As a minor scale, it has 7 degree phonemes, which we can label /A/ /B/ /C/ /D/ /E/ /F/ /G/. However, in a rising melody /G/ can be realised as \\[G#\\], but this creates the sequence \\[F G#\\], which is not allowed in the \"phonotactics\" of Western music, as that's an augmented second (i.e. that interval that all stereotypical Middle Eastern musics have). As a result, /F/ is also raised to resolve this issue, and is thus realised as \\[F#\\], with the scale now realised as \\[A B C D E F# G#\\]. This \"phonetic realisation\" of the minor scale we have dubbed \"melodic minor\".\n\nI'm not sure if this analogy is meaningful in any way, and it certainly isn't useful, but I thought it was really neat and I wanted to share it with y'all! I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it.",

I see two options:\n\n* both path and manner appear in the same form as each other (both as verb roots in serial verb constructions, for example, *I run-leave-PST house*)\nverb-framing and satellite-framing occur in corpora roughly equally often, and don't need to share constructions (*I ran out of the house*, *I left the house running*)\n\nWhich is it? Or is there a third option?",

        "text": "In the classic comparative illusion, \"more people have been to Russia than I have\" it's easy to see that the sentence is nonsense. The comparison doesn't actually mean anything, which is especially evident if you take away the ellipsis: \"more people have been to Russia than I have been to Russia.\" Sure, you can infer a couple different meanings, but none are supported by the syntax of the sentence itself. \n\n(A correct grammatical reading is possible if you read \"have\" to mean \"own\" but let's not chase our tails here. The sentence illustrates a disconnect between syntax and how we process language.) \n\nHowever, in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_illusion) for this phenomenon, there are several other examples listed that have me scratching my head. \n\nThe first that tripped me up, an example of the comparative illusion that was actually published in a news article, reads: \"In Michigan and Minnesota, more people found Mr Bush's ads negative than they did Mr Kerry's.\" After reading [a bunch of linguists argue back and forth about it](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1997) I *think* I see what's ungrammatical here, but to be frank, I'm not entirely sure I buy it. \n\nIt gets worse, though. Deeper in the Wiki article, two other examples of the comparative illusion are given from a neurolinguistic study:\n\n1. 'More men have eaten meat than women have according to the report.'\n\n2. 'More boys have lost the sense of hearing than girls have in Denmark.'\n\nI am pulling my hair out trying to understand what is illusory about this comparison. It seems very cut-and-dried. There are a number of men and a number of women. The number of men who have eaten meat is greater than the number of women who have eaten meat. Same with the second example.\n\nThese sentences still make sense when you remove the ellipsis: \"More men have eaten meat than women have eaten meat according to the report.\" \"'More boys have lost the sense of hearing than girls have lost the sense of hearing in Denmark.\"\n\nThe [original study](https://ebooks.au.dk/index.php/aul/catalog/view/119/107/466-1) in which these examples are found doesn't shed any light on things.\n\nWhat the heck is wrong with these sentences? Where is the syntax error? And why is it so hard to see?",
