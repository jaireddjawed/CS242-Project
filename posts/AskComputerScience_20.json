        "text": "So I'm absolutly fascinated with cryptocurrencies and blockchain and the entire crypto field in general to be honest. It's what inspired me to go back to school for a CS degree. \n\nI'll admit I'm not much of a gamer and I'm no programmer yet. So I may not know what the hell I'm talking about here. But I do have an idea that I think is brilliant. \n\nPeople pay upwards of $50 for a game for their Xbox or PlayStation or even their Gaming PC. Mining cryptos requires at the very least a quality GPU...some coins can be mined with CPUs but not many and using your phone or tablet just doesn't have enough hashrate to get the block rewards often enough to make it worth while. \n\nHowever, couldn't a game developer create a cool and fun game to simulate mining for cryotos? Like say \"Gold Digger\" where the users character is a miner with a pick ax chipping away in a virtual gold mine. When a block reward is found it's simulated in the game as fining gold coins. In the game the player received game tokens that can be used to purchase in-game features like a new shovel or hard hat or what have you. In the real world the block reward is actually Monero and deposited into the game developers Monero wallet. The game developer could then give the game away for free and make money proportionate to the number of gamers playing (mining). \n\nAnother example: Say a large blood drive charity were to create a game where the entire world is overrun by zombies and researchers need to find X number of live humans that posses some ultra rare blood type. In this game the rare blood type would simulate the block reward. When the gamer finds the human with this blood type X amount of zombies are cured and the object is to cure every one. In the real world that rare blood type discovered is actually new Monero coins being deposited into the charities crypto wallet to fund research or promote real world blood drives etc. \n\n(I also posted this in r/game development) ",

To my understanding hasNextInt() tests the next set of characters in an input for an integer. In the definition of the question, the wording suggests that it just checks if the input string is an integer. Also, I am not saying C is right either I understand how that is wrong.\n ",

        "text": "From experience, I think we can all agree certain ways of coding are better for different areas. For example,  during a talk Bjarne Stroustrup talk mentioned flight control not using new or delete after take off but how that is bad in other domains. Certain design features being valuable in a particular context is the very reason we have Domain Specific Languages(DSLs). The problem of best practice can be expanded further to talking about things like C being better for low level hardware while things like Haskell can be very valuable for software verification. So obviously tools have abstract qualities that make them comparatively more or less valuable for a given problem. That is not even factoring in tools that can complement each other, like some algorithms working better in one language paradigm compared to another. \n\nI understand a lot of this boils down to experience and what works at the time, but I feel like this is a big enough problem people have to be researching it. Below are some questions that I think are common. \n\n- How do you decide what features your tools should have for solving a problem?\n\n- How do you decide what attributes your algorithms should have in a given context?\n\n- How do you know when all of your tools and features will complement each other? \n \n- What would best practice be in this domain? \n\n\nI can see elements of algorithm design, language design, and even general software development, just to name a few. I would love you hear other peoples thoughts. \n\n\n\nP.S.\n\nBjarne Stroustrup talk mentioned above: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OEu9C51K2A",

If it takes a classical computer a billion years to break pre-quantum encryption, how long will it take to break post-quantum encryption?",

Meanwhile on my cellphone operator (the Brazilian branch of Telecom Italia) I can only select one month of the last 6 months, and take almost a minute to deliver the result.\n\nOther examples of slow databases:\n\nMy professor worked on a very big phone company and said when some customer wanted his usage history, it would take days to get that. \n\n\nI have a friend who works at Volvo store and when they get a sales report, he says it kills the entire database for that day. \n\n\nOne day that my ISP simple disabled my internet without any reason, I knew that was the reason but they didn't believe in me and sent a tech. After the tech said that was the reason I told the the customer service to check that and it took like 15 minutes for her to say \"oh yeah, you are right, your internet is disabled here\". \n\n\nWhy this happens? The technology is obviously there, I can instantly access my entire purchase history on steam, amazon or even in small sales sites, but some big companies needs minutes or days to get a consult for a single customer.",

        "text": "A hopfield dependnet is a hopfield net and a list of its nodes where a node is 1 (else 0) if the weightedSum of nodes earlier in the list are positive. This is npcomplete, can represent any logic of AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, X choose at least Y, etc. Its also a recognizer of valid orders of nodes based on npcomplete constraints, unlike a normal dependnet which must do all of a node's dependencies (AND) before doing that node.\n\nWhat UIs and algorithms would you use to consider various orders? I imagine putting the nodes on a diagonal and their weights an adjacency matrix is a basic start, and drag them to be before or after eachother to include in eachother's weightedSum. If a node you want to accomplish is 0, you'd go looking for nodes ahead of it which it fuzzy-depends on and drag them before it, meaning plan to do them before, and recursively they have their own requirements.",

        "text": "I'm in a \"big\" project of my university (like a thesis, but not a thesis) where I have to define a more or less complex web application, build a prototipe and estimate the costs of developing the full web application.\n\nThe thing is that I found [this paper][1] that talks about the WEBMO model (based on COCOMO II) which presents a method to calculate the development costs, basically the method is:\n\n 1. Count and classify web object predictors and multiply them by the corresponding weight according to the complexity (just like in table 4).\n 2. Transform the number obtained in 1. into #KSLOC using table 7.\n 3. Use the equations at the end of the 3rd page to get the estimation for the effort and time needed to develop the web application.\n\nBut I had a doubt about the example shown in the paper... what bothers me is that in the table 4 it says that 16 HTML lines represents 17.98 percent of the effort to finish this proyect (because 16 * 4 = 64, which is 17.98 percent of 356, the total size of the proyect), which then it's said it's a 5 month proyect in the 4rd page, WTF? **16 HTML lines is the 17.98% of a 5 month proyect?** it's a typo? or they were referring to 16 HTML files?\n\nBesides that I **have tried to find the factors that multiply the number of XML, HTML, and query lines in low complexity, high complexity and number of scripts in high complexity in the web object calculation worksheet, but the problem is that what I've found has other multiplying factors**, for example in [this book][2] it says that an average multimedia file has a weight of 2, but in the example of [paper][1] that I previously put the weight for the same item is 5, not 2.\n\n\n  [1]: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a65/1ebcb9b11955d9e08866225d901fd1bd80de.pdf\n  [2]: https://books.google.cl/books?id=9yrdvfZX3CoC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=webmo%20development%20cost&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y4tBec_mz-&amp;sig=EVEpae5fEna5QqJc6JAFpSpBl9s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO2OyPzfLZAhWGhZAKHW3ACBc4ChDoAQgvMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=webmo%20development%20cost&amp;f=false",

I posted here a few days ago asking about SQL I believe asking a similar question. I am stuck because there are so many interesting things I want to learn and they can all solve relevant problems in my life:\n\n-I work for a nonprofit that would like to set up a database and SQL is a very employable skill so I want to learn that.\n\n-I'd like to set up my own website based resume using Javascript at some point this summer\n\n-I also would like to revamp the nonprofit's website this summer with javascript\n\n-I enjoy C++ a ton(I enjoy all of this a ton) but only know the bare basics and would like to know more(I can make text-based console adventure games, would like to get really in-depth knowledge of c++ because about 80% of the places I'd like to get internships in college require it!) I'd say this is my favorite choice and I'd honestly be okay with ditching all other options for this except I just feel like I'm missing out if I do that.\n\n-My college won't let CS students take a Data Structures and Algorithms class until spring Sophomore year which is an issue since I want to apply for internships all years of college. So I'd like to take some sort of MOOC(Preferably from a reputable source on EdX) over this so I can start working on it in my own time so I'll be more prepared for interviews when that time comes\n\nAlso, I really want to start contributing to open source ASAP and I feel the only way to do that would be the focus in on one language here but correct me if you think there's a just as suitable way.\n\nMaybe I'm just way too ahead of myself but I just have this fear of being underprepared because that was basically the story of my life in high school. But I am also very very anxious to learn everything here, it all seems fun to me and it can all solve a problem in my life so now I'm just confused about what to do!\n\n\n\nSide note: I'll also be learning Java next year...taking two high school classes(one taught through local college about programming in java directly and one is AP Computer Science Principles which allows Java as one of the languages to be used) so I'll be learning that next year too though I'd say Java was the language that started me with serious programming/the fundamentals of computer science and I'm already fairly strong in it as far as amateurs go.",

These are the few good things I have heard about each:\n\nFor databases, I have heard that a sound knowledge of SQL is very much appreciated by employers and is also applicable a lot in real life.\n\nI keep hearing that although learning about compilers is not necessarily applicable in real life, it helps you become a much better programmer because you know the ins and outs of a compiler and what it expects. \n\nI also hear that a sound knowledge of computer networks is very applicable in understanding how different systems communicate with each other and, therefore, how one can code efficient systems to act accordingly.\n\nFor cryptography, I have heard that there are plenty of jobs available in the field such as security engineering etc.\n\nAnd obviously machine learning is huge these days and has applications to a variety of fields like AI, CV, robotics etc.\n\nSo I was wondering what people think the best four would be. Mainly in terms of career opportunities, appeal and general applicability in real life. They all seem quite good so I'm finding it difficult to eliminate one of them.\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated!  ",

Until yesterday, I thought I had scratched the possibility of applying to my school's 5th year Masters program due to some external circumstances, but they were resolved and now I've realized that I have around 9 days to complete essentially my entire masters application, including setting up a research project and getting a teacher to endorse it.  What I've figured so far is that that requirement is the most constraining factor on whether or not I'll be able to complete this application, so I wanted to complete that portion of the app first.\n\nThat being said, I haven't done research before (not a requirement for my school's program since the masters is more academically based than research based) and I don't particularly want to/spend too much time on it either, as I'm trying to do this masters more for the extra time I'll get to take more upper level comp sci courses at my university.\n\nWhat I'm trying to find in my research project is\n\nA) Something that fits in my areas of interest (artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning, data analysis and science, combinatorics and statistics) as well as my areas of interest outside of computer science (not sure if any of these following areas are even valid related areas for a masters cs project, but just in case, areas like game logic and strategies (for like, chess, for example), football/fantasy football, economics and industry/customer relations)\n\nB) Something that would preferably not kill my time next year (not because I don't want to work hard, but more because I'd prefer to spend my time on classes rather than research)\n\nC) Something that wouldn't be so derivative that it would pique a professor's interest and possibly get them to help me out on this extremely, extremely last minute request.\n\nI'm not asking for someone to magically give me a project idea that fits this exactly (though if someone did that would be amazing), but more I guess a direction to go if these are the priorities for my project selection.  As I said, I've never done research before, so selecting a research project at this level is an unknown to me, and I would appreciate any feedback or tips I got.\n\nAlso, I realize that my situation is probably pretty fucked, I'm really determined to try and figure out a way to deliver a completed application by next Friday, and it would help a lot if people who have gone through this process before could give me any tips on how to proceed with this application process, esp. in terms of professor interactions regarding potential research projects.\n\nThanks so much!!  Also, if this is the wrong sub for these type of posts, pls lmk so I can delete it and move it to the correct sub.",

I was thinking of building a polling web app along the lines of reddit, but I began to worry about accuracy in the votes due to the amount of accounts I'm able to create arbitrarily. It's the same on any website: facebook, twitter, instagram, etc; but it's not true of banking apps. \n I can't open a profile at chase.com with a fraudulent name because it has to be connected to an account with the same name, and I think that's illegal, I'm not sure. My point is, anyone accessing an account on a banking web app is a verified person, relatively unspoofable. Do they do any kind of official OAuth, I don't want to know anyone's private information, but if they sign in to their own account through like an iframe or even a link and the bank says its clear, something like that? Or any other methods to make sure authentic people and not trolls or bots are polling?",
