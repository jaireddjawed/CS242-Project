        "text": "There are legitimate criticisms of her work, many of which probably actually serve the point Amber poorly attempts to make, but the idea of her just thinking that she can scream at people into being not racist is extremely misleading. \n\nThe only reason I think it‚Äôs worth pointing this out, is that if racial activism is going to progress beyond its current (mostly liberal) iteration, it needs to understand where it‚Äôs succeeded and failed, and there success and failures in Elliot‚Äôs work people can pull from, but only if they understand. Amber‚Äôs misrepresentation of the Wikipedia entry (which I‚Äôm pretty sure she accidentally quoted) isn‚Äôt furthering that understanding.",

        "text": "This just happened and now I'm in the middle of another lecture about bitcoin so instead of watching this nonsense I'm gonna tell you what just happened.\n\nSo I'm in a coding convention and just had to watch a lecture on enterpreneurship given by this old lady that was a puke inducing, ideology-ridden puff piece for capitalism full of the usual meaningless buzzwords. At one point she cited as an example of innovation, a time when some toothpaste company made the hole on their toothpaste tubes larger in order to \"sell more toothpaste\". This didn't sound weird at all to her, but it did to me, so I started formulating a question on my phone cause I didn't wanna fuck it up and at the end of it she had time for only one question.\n\nThe old lady then went around the room literally distributing pens and trying to coax people into asking questions, I was really nervous but as she handed me a pen I said I had a question.\n\nI'll try to recall to the best of my memory what followed\n\nI asked, \"you mentioned that innovation is a good thing because it generates profits to the company, but what about innovations that generate profits but end up being detrimental to the consumer, such as planned obsolescence, which is when products are designed to break after a set amount of time?\"\n\nsuddenly the whole room full of tech bros was taken by murmurs as everyone seemed to have an opinion. I felt kind of vulnerable, as if I had just done something forbidden or taboo.\n\nThe lady started her answer by saying that she never mentioned that innovation is good because of profits, she instead said some platitude that innovation is good for every individual, then went on to answer something I didn't ask, saying that \"not all innovations pan out, some products don't take off but the innovation of making them was still worth it\", cited some examples of failed ideas, and said \"I don't know if this answered your question, what was the second part of your question?\"\n\n(Mine wasn't a two part question but ok bitch)\n\n\"I asked about innovation that generates profit by tricking consumer to spend money unnecessarily\" I said, to which some other guy added \"Yeah! Like the toothpaste example!\", and the lady got confused. She asked for clarification to what the toothpaste problem is to which I said \"they made more money by widening the toothpaste tube hole because that made people use more toothpaste than previous, in essence tricking consumers to waste toothpaste\" and she took issue with the implication that people were being tricked, she maintained that it was their choice but ended up granting that maybe that had been an unfortunate example. \n\nSome guy raised his voice and said some nonsense that the toothpaste innovation was still good because it met the objective of selling more toothpaste which just generated more confusion and commotion in the room, the old lady had some line about enterpreneurs not being villains, and an organizer lady had to calm the room down to announce that time had run out and they had to set up the next talk, which is this boring ass bitcoin talk I'm in.\n\nThis felt good. It felt good to be a part of the ongoing trend that is neoliberal ideology being challenged everywhere it goes. This room full of techbros, while not fully receptive to my wrench-in-the-machinery, was also not fully repulsed by it. A single question turned what was supposed to be just an unchallenged conversion therapy to neoliberalism into a conflicted moment that got people thinking.\n\nmatch me you fuckers, challenge neoliberalism wherever you find it",
