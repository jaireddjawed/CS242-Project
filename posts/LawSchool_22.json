Guy has nowhere on his brochure or website the price. Anyways I email him asking him about the process and he says email me back all of these forms and then we could book an online or in person appointment to discuss more. I send him what he requested and he calls me back 2 days later asks me two questions and tells me his price. \nI tell him what I was expecting price to be and that I was hoping to do the meeting to discuss price and more before he did any work. \nThe call went like just have one question ‚Ä¶ blah blah‚Ä¶ and then goes okay Ill send you an online doc u sign and it‚Äôll be blank price. \n\nI tell him that price is high compared to someone else I could have used and he starts insulting me repeatedly. I don‚Äôt care for words so I just told him sorry for wasting your time. He continues to insult and claims he‚Äôs going to call his attorney and file a claims report. \n\nSo no prices or fees written anywhere, no appointment for questions like asked, just did it all without questions and requested payment. Would like to add on there is some stuff I asked him about on the phone call and he just said no with no explanation. \n\nJust want to make sure I‚Äôm in the clear here and would even like to fight back against him if I could. He does have all of my information however so I was wondering what I could do to prevent any use of my social security and such. \n\nI know this isn‚Äôt legal advice but I can‚Äôt afford to go sit with an attorney so I came to my second home Reddit. Thanks in advance everyone.",

        "text": "Let me give some background to the most recent events...I was put under court supervision back in May of 2022. I was set up to report to my probation officer electronically through a site called MonitorConnect. I was unable to report through the site for about two months because I was not given a pin. I contacted the number on the documents I had and left a few voicemails for my PO alerting him that I could not login into the site. I did not hear back for two months, and when I was responded to I learned that my PO had changed two months ago, despite no one telling me. The short of it here is that my new PO gave my PIN, and then never responded back to the other questions I raised.\n\nNow, this is where I really think the negligence comes in. Back in September, I emailed proper documentation to my PO of all the things the court stipulated I must do, as well as had paid off all my fines. Then, in January I received a letter stating a hearing was made to discuss the revocation of my probation. I had to get back into contact with my attorney because I had not violated any condition of my probation. He was able to get into contact with her, and she said I had failed to provide documentation of my court appointed duties. I informed my attorney I had emailed her the documents back in September. She checked and realized her mistake, and called the judge and the hearing was dropped.\n\nHowever, she stated that the CRN I had completed way back in August did not count for the county in which my supervision was located. So I now have to go back to a county an hour away without my license to do another CRN, which if she had been diligent she would have been able to tell me I needed to come down months ago to get it done, and not in the middle of my college semester. Furthermore, since this contact with my attorney, I have been worried that she has not been sending my documentation over to PennDot in order that I may get my license back. I have called her four times this past week, listing my concerns and asking for a call back and have not received any word whatsoever. \n\nI continue to call and she does not answer or call back. Is this negligence? What can I do? Is there any grounds to bring my disappointment and concern to the courts? Thanks Reddit.",

It seems like most CPAs obtain a JD for purposes of going into tax or estate planning. However, in my research of the ‚Äútypes‚Äù of law a lawyer could practice, I came across corporate law. I was wondering if anyone could share some insight on what lawyers in corporate law do in their day to day, and just how much help someone with a CPA background could provide?\n2. In terms of law school apps, I‚Äôve heard that ad coms mainly care about UG GPA + LSAT. I went to a top public university (not sure if that means anything?) in the US but graduated with a 3.27 GPA so just how screwed am I if my goal is getting into a T14? Is a top 25 or 50 school the lowest you would go before considering whether going to law school is truly worth it given my current + future salary and job security in accounting?\n\nI appreciate all responses, and everyone‚Äôs help in advance!",

The thing stopping me is my fear of having the same problem, although knowing more about how it is going to be like, if my law school will take me back, is breaking down and giving it up. I realize now what went wrong and why it went wrong. As in debt as I am in, I am struggling a little with confidence, but I honestly want to go back earn law degree, pass the bar, and be an attorney.

        "text": "So I‚Äôve posted on here before but there were a few people in the comments who were accusing me of being a fraud so I stopped posting. But I‚Äôm in need of advice and thoughts so I‚Äôm posting again.\n\nSo when I graduated law school I made a public LinkedIn post thanking everyone who helped along the way and said that graduating as the youngest in my class felt surreal. In hindsight I now know that it doesn‚Äôt matter what age you graduate as long as you get it done. But I was just proud of myself because I was multiple years younger than my classmates and really struggled to get good grades competing against people who were much more experienced, knowledgeable and generally more focused than I was.\n\nAnyways, after I made this LinkedIn post I received congratulatory likes and comments from approximately 200 individuals. It was really flattering to say the least because I had issues with my confidence due to poor law school GPA. I graduated with a 2.9 when the curve at my school only goes as low as a 3.0. I went below the curve out of the discretion of a few professors due to missing more classes than was allowed. There were 4 classes for which I missed more than 20% of the sessions for the semester. I had a lot of anxiety regarding cold-calling as I‚Äôm not quick on my feet and English is my second language so I was really uncomfortable with cold calling and missed a lot of classes as a result. Due to missing so many classes, I felt like a fraud compared to my classmates who attended all the classes and made their own outlines for the exams. I studied using commercial outlines for the most part.\n\nAnother issue I faced during law school was something called depersonalization disorder. I had it for the entire final year due to smoking weed that triggered a psychotic state of mind. I felt really spaced out the whole time and had trouble accessing my memories and formulating coherent sentences. It gradually got better over time.\n\nSo those were the issues I faced during law school which lead me to make that LinkedIn post in which I said that graduating felt surreal. Because it did. But fast forward a year into my new job at a law firm, a client of ours reads my LinkedIn post and actually accuses me of being a fraud and threatens me with prison. I had failed the bar exam and was working as a law clerk with the intention of re-sitting the bar. But the client (around 20 people on a zoom call) made it very clear that I was not wanted in the law firm and that I should pack my bags and leave, or else I would face prison time for being a fraud. So I packed my bags and left. This was all because of one LinkedIn post in which I said that it felt surreal to graduate as the youngest in my class (and surreal for various other reasons including my anxiety, depersonalization, me being an international student, my fear of cold calling, the fact that I competed against people much older than me, and just the sheer difficulty of the classes I was taking). \n\nI‚Äôm now studying to re-sit the bar exam in order to find suitable employment. My question is, given all of the details of my case that I provided above, is there anything that I should be afraid of in terms of legal consequences of my actions? I know that bragging on LinkedIn wasn‚Äôt a good idea but I was just honestly proud of myself and I don‚Äôt know how that escalated into me being accused of being a fraud.\n\nAnyways thanks a lot for reading this far if you have and I look forward to your responses. If you need any additional details feel free to ask and I will provide as appropriate.",

I would do it, 100%, IF I wasn't a law student that would be jeopardized by missing class time, and during my break if my financial situation allowed so. \n\nJury summons *should* be \"random\" selection, right? \n\nMy husband was summoned 4 times in a row although it was indicated in the first letter as a response he could not miss work due to financial hardship. They finally left him alone, now they are sending me letters. I have sent these idiots 5 letters explaining I am a law student and I cannot miss class time because it would seriously jeopardize my studies. 6 summons later I am wondering what I need to say to them to get them to understand and quit harassing specifically my household. There are plenty of other people they could move on to and frankly I am getting irritated with them. \n\nThe 6th summons has a box indicating students must reschedule to their nearest break. My nearest (spring) break I will be out of town (already booked tickets prior receiving the summons), summer break I will be interning/won't be permitted to miss time considering I **need** the money to survive and pay bills while I do not have student loan money coming in (provided they don't offer paid jury duty which, I'm sure as an internship, they probably won't). The only time/break I can see available as of right now is Thanksgiving of this year or Christmas. Is it necessary for me to write this on the form? What do I need to do to get them to stop and understand it is not possible? Am I allowed to feel frustrated with them? Any advice is appreciated.",

Some amount disbursed upon accepting the offer, some amount accepting the 2L return offer, some amount joining the firm as an associate. But this promissory note says that I'll have to pay any amount given to me back if I fail at any one of these steps, basically that if I don't come back during 2L I have to pay back the scholarship money given to me as a 1L. This does not seem like the norm and I have a bad gut reaction to it. Any experience or thoughts on this?",
