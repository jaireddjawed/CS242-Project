        "text": "I graduated with a BS in electrical engineering and have been working as an engineer for five years.  However, my real passion is educational materials and curricula and I hope to make a career change to work in that area. \n\nWith my specific interests below in mind, I have two questions.  Is pursuing a PhD in educational research the right decision or is there another path that is more appropriate?  If a PhD is correct, how would you recommend I go about finding an adviser for what seem to be rather uncommon academic interests?\n\n* Critical/scientific thinking - Developing materials and curricula aimed at teaching children to assess the validity of information and make correct conclusions.  Heavily inspired by the work of Carl Sagan and other eminent popularizers of science.  I believe education in this area is critical to our ability to make both short-term, individual decisions, as well as long-term, global decisions.\n* Problems faced by humanity - Developing materials and curricula aimed at teaching children about the major problems humanity faces.  I hope to also inspire a compassion for others and desire to contribute to the future well-being of humanity, as well as a sense of sense of unique individual purpose to help address one of these issues.\n* Expanding the reach of educational materials - Thousands of wonderful educational materials exist today, from books and ebooks to ipad games and board games.  However, as an educator finding these resources is difficult, especially when you have a large list of topics you are trying to cover with a range student skill levels.  I would like to work on making educational resources as simple to use and find as possible, most likely through a website. ",

        "text": "Hi, I've been offered two PhD positions. One is in a new place and one is where I got my M.A.\n\nThe two basic factors are setting and topic. Place 1 is in Asia at a university where the ranking isn't great but the philosophy program is very good. The other is in a higher ranked university where the philosophy program is not quite as strong (perhaps). The money is slightly different-- I will be fully funded at both but one place is offering more than double the money. One program is 3 years one is 4-5 years.\n\nThere are a lot of emotional factors at play here. Fear/excitement, nostalgia, comfort, etc. These emotions have to do with the places rather than the topics.\n\nAs for the topics, one of them seems objectively quite important to me and the other one may have objective importance and is perhaps more aligned with my interests, at least as far as the things I tend to think about in my spare time just out of interest.\n\nOne option would lead me to become an expert in analytic philosophy and the other one would cross together some analytic philosophy with literary theory (weird but part of why I like it). \n\nWhen I first got into the first place I was depressed and felt that I didn't want to go there. But now that I have this other option I'm wondering if that was just out of fear or having no alternative. Now that I have two choices the idea of turning the first one down makes me cry sometimes.\n\nI don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice for how to make this decision? Need more information?\n\n(One other thing-- I might have the option of going to one place for a year and seeing if I like it and applying to the other place again if I don't; this option doesn't work the other way around. But I don't know, I'm weirdly reluctant about this...)",

Without going into too much detail, basically I wrote something like \"the values for A and B were Y and X, respectively\" when I should have written \"the values for A and B were X and Y, respectively\". I must have combed through this damn thing a hundred times before submitting it, but somehow I missed something so obvious and easily fixable.

So unfortunately, I will have to report it as an erratum. I sent a message to the journal staff telling them about it, but because it's the weekend, I probably won't hear back from them until tomorrow. We'll see what happens.\n\nI guess what I want to talk about here is, has anyone else had to do anything like this? If so, what was the process like?

I consider \"elite\" to be MIT, Caltech, Stanford, etc. While the program itself is a great fit for me, I worry about the type of people who I will be surrounded by.\n\nWhen I was at the visit days for another school I got into, which is still a good school but not as highly ranked as the one I picked, the caliber of the students seemed a little lacking. Most people came from no-name public schools and sort of stumbled into the field they ended up researching in. Very few people, at least in undergrad, seemed to really have their shit together. A lot of them were actually impressed at my background, which I found disconcerting.\n\nAt the school I'm going to attend, I didn't get to talk with students as much. However, I still noticed that everyone who came from a no-name school ended up accepting their offer. But everyone who came from \"elite\" schools accepted offers from other \"elite\" schools. Similarly, many of my overachieving friends from undergrad are going to \"elite\" schools.\n\nSo this leaves me with my problem: I want to be in the company of the overachievers, but I worry that very few of them are going to go to a \"tier-2\" school. Why would you pick anything but MIT if you're shooting for the stars? Especially if you're the type of person to practically invent a new field with your research contributions?

        "text": "Wall o' text incoming. TLDR; Title says it all.\n\nI am a co-author on a paper. The first author has routinely not taken our (me and the other co-authors) advice or additions. The project is collaborative in nature, but the first author even refuses to take my advice when we are taking about the domain in which I have vastly more expertise than anyone else on the team. We have finally reached a point where the first author wants to submit data that believe leads to spurious results and therefore unreliable conclusions. If the first author will not change this bad analysis I will not have the paper published with my name attached. What other steps if any could I or should I take?\n\nI will include the tale of woe below. For some context that will pop up later, one of the other co-authors has a potential conflict of interest with the journal editor. The conflict is the co-author has published some relatively recent work with the editor. So the journal editor has been completely hands off and everything has been handled be associate editors. Also, I am early career. The first-author is mid career.\n\nOur data is complex, so the first author cobbled together a series of statistical tests. Everything he did was valid, but it was cumbersome. I proposed using some more complex and advanced techniques. I ran the analyses, the pattern of results was identical, and now we had a single omnibus regression that did everything instead of a series of other things (t tests, ANOVAs, etc.). After battling for two months on the merits of each analytic approach, he finally put his foot down and said we will not be using the more advanced techniques because it is not conventional. I agreed to this because his initial analyses were not wrong and I just thought mine were better.\n\nWe submit the manuscript and get our reviews back. The reviewers and the AE thought the analyses were terrible and suggested something more in line with what I wanted to do. The first author, again, refused to put these analyses in. I spent a lot more time battling him over this issue, but again he refused. He wrote a relatively long reply letter to the AE explaining why his analyses were the best approach to take. There were also other critiques and suggestions to make the manuscript better. He probably agreed to address 50&amp;#37; of the critique.\n\nWe took a couple of months to get the resubmission in. Unfortunately, over this short time the AE that was in charge rotated off the editorial board. When the AE was asked to continue working on this manuscript, he declined. I am not sure if an AE was assigned, but the manuscript went back to the reviewers and one of the reviewers wrote the newer decision letter (we know it was a reviewer because they told us). The decision was to accept pending revisions. The revisions were essentially, fix everything you refused to fix the first time.\n\nThe first author's approach was then to excise everything the reviewers critiqued. So instead of addressing the problem, just delete it and it is not a concern. I thought this was a little silly, but we were still answering our main questions of interest while only losing some additional \"hey, we also found this maybe cool thing that warrants future research.\" We resubmit.\n\nA new AE is assigned. The AE likes the questions we asked and thinks the MS is in a really good place. However, the AE is an expert in the area and in the analyses. He refuses to let the analyses be published because he knows they are wrong. He demands we either do something like what I initially wanted or remove that analyses. He also thinks we are making an unsubstantiated claim in our conclusions. To be clear, I fully agree with the AE's critique. In response, the first author totally deletes the experimental question making the statistical analyses (for this subset of the data) unnecessary. This is really stupid, and cuts our paper in half, but there is nothing inherently wrong with it. For the other critique, he proceeds to do a half-ass analysis to substantiate our claim. The problem is the analysis is incorrect. He is making assumptions that he should not make with our data. The assumptions are so wrong that if you talk about what he is doing from just a conceptual standpoint, it literally does not make sense. I have tried to get him to fix it, or get him to send me the data so I can fix it, and he will not.\n\nThe first author has lurched from stupid decision to stupid decision. He has shifted from stupid decisions to bad decisions and bad science. I do not want my name associated with such shoddy work (especially when he will not listen to my input).\n\nWhat are my options?\n\n1. I can definitely have my name taken off the article.\n2. Can I block publication? I have contributed significantly (although, not as much as I would have liked). We haven't transferred copyright yet, so I feel I do have some ownership of the manuscript.\n3. If I remove my name/block publication, should I contact the AE? I think a \"I don't want my name on this article anymore\" would be appropriate. Would it be appropriate/helpful to point out \"this specific thing is why I am pulling my name off\" and then leaving a lot of the other interpersonal drama and stupid decisions out of the picture?\n4. These are all nuclear options, is there anything less dramatic I could do? I going to take one last attempt to convince the first author to fix the analysis, but based on experience I do not think anything will change.\n\nI would also add, I am not worried about any blow back from my co-authors as we have been on the same side (they might be upset if I try to fully block publication, I suppose). I am also not worried about blow back from the first author.",

        "text": "Hi all. This will be a long post, as I'm trying to sort of lay out my whole life situation here, and so I'm sorry for having put up such a large chunk of text, and also extend my highest gratitude to anyone reading this.\nSo I really adore the humanities, and it's been my dream to make a career out of this love. I have long been aware that alas, life under capitalism can be crushing, and it might most be crushing in my (umbrella) area of interest in the U.S.: Comparative Literature. First off:\n\n**1. What type of a program would best be suited to at the very least expanding the scope of jobs I could get into?** I'm only a B.A. right now, but I'll try to get into a PhD as I do think I'm a lot further along than most of my peers sheerly in terms of how well-read I am. \n\nI have a good grasp on the western literary \"canon\" (everything, from Attic Drama/Comedy, to Spanish Pastoral, to English, Spanish and Russian Modernism, to Pushkin, to 19th century novels, pre-modern-but-still-kinda-modern-Lit etc). For my senior thesis I am looking to write on irony, and its use and abuse in the 20th century. My idea is to first scope out varying degrees, layers and forms of the ironic and how they play out in *social* distinction, so I was going to compare 16th century Spanish pastoral and 19th century Russian \"Pastoral\"  -- I am following Empson, and everyone who has read Empson knows he's a little nutty and expands the definition of Pastoral to really include everything that's of worth in Western Lit, so that's that. Essentially, what I'm trying to get at is that any number of departments would interest me, and I'll have a better grasp of my \"specialty\" in the years to come, as well as a theory and mode of reading literary texts that I myself am currently trying to flesh out.\n\nAnd I think that a project like the one I have proposed above could work equally well in the right type of interdisciplinary sociology department, or in a history department. I am actually really interested in sociology, and the rise of the \"social\" as an idea: particularly Ian Hacking and the history of statistics, the question of historical distinction and Latour (although to my understanding Latour is really going out of style in Sociology departments -- and for good reason haha), Bordieu of course, Howie Becker, Talcott Parsons, Weber, Luman, etc etc. None of this is quantitative sociology, but what interests me is the question of the quantitative, and for me, the 'literary' is really a mode of thinking that can be expanded to any number of fields. Critical Theory, as unfortunate as that discipline is, has really shaped me in my development as a BA and I stick to that now, for better or for worse, both in life and death. \n\nAgain, not trying to write a statement of purpose here -- only to communicate my interests. I also really like Linguistics, but  I'm really a Conty here so it's all Saussure, Jakobson, Bienveniste, Greimas, etc., and not Cognitive Linguistics, Psycholinguistics, or anything to do with Chomsky or neurobiology, though I'm not *adverse* to these modes of study. I'm interested in neuropolitics, for example. \n\nI'm also quite well-read in philosophy, and I could see my study of irony working well in, again, the conty context; irony is the highest form of truth in that it assimilate the non-truth to its truth without heavily distinguishing the two. Rorty has done work on this, it could work. But to my understanding Phil departments kind of suck in the U.S., and I'm not bad at formal and modal logic but I just don't enjoy it, and I think I would get stuck to working under one paradigm (which would happen basically anywhere so????). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for a good job prospect after my PhD, where do I apply that would still allow me to not risk going hungry or teaching high school or changing careers post-PhD? I have singled out Comp-Lit because it seems to me to be the discipline where I can stick to both philosophical, sociological and literary texts. \n\nI realize also that a lot of jobs in academia are specialized. So I guess an \"expansive\" degree might not be particularly useful; so, a subsidiary to question (1): **is there any use in trying to getting a more \"generalized\" degree that doesn't rely on very specific job openings?** \n\nAlso, I'm fluent in English, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish, and have seriously studied texts in all of these languages. I'm also semi-fluent in French and have worked on Baudelaire, but it's not great. We're getting there though :) Other pertinent info: I go to a middling LAC, so not great for apps, but my GPA is north of 3.9 and I have some beautiful relations with my profs (though -- as I'm sure you all know, professors are some of the weirdest people out there) -- so my letters of rec should be really strong. Writing sample and statement of interest is really a question of what I *choose* to use, as I've got a lot of things that I've written. \n\n2) **I need to have a back-up plan, so what are some things I could work on over these next 5-6 years that could potentially help me have something to fall back on?** \n\nListen, I consider myself to be a talented, well-read, and hard working individual, but the fact of the matter is that in this line of work, that's not enough. Nothing is enough, because the market is abysmal. I have read the other threads. A lot of luck is involved, and I'm not so brilliant that my work will always be recognized. Better people than me have been *crushed*, and I'm trying to come to terms with that. I also want to bang out my PhD and maybe have it done when I'm 26-27 (???) so that I can evaluate my options, and, if necessary, shift gears early on. \n\nA bunch of friends of mine have succeeded in free-lancing, but it's not free-lancing so much as marketing oneself, and the whole \"woke-for-sale\" scoop. It really is one of those situations where going to an experimental Liberal Arts College is actually marketable. Now -- that type of stuff takes A LOT of energy, and it would be distracting from my primary option, so how badly should I be trying to have a career *adjacent* to academia, and not just as a backup plan? I'm not even sure if this question is answerable, moreso looking to here your experiences. \n\n3) **Is there anything I could do, early on right now (I'm 21), that potentially could provided me with more security in transitioning into a tenure track position post-doc?**\n\nI'm always conducting research, and I'm always imagining papers I could be writing. As much I hate publish-or-perish, should I swallow my pride and try to bang out 20-pagers every two weeks or so and send them in to publications, even weak ones? Would having a publishing record early on help me at all? Is being prolific a useful value, when it comes to getting jobs? What else is there that I can do, to **try** to expand my possibilities.\n\nAs a final note, I really, really love what I do, what I read, and it would really crush me to have to do something else. Based on how anxious I'm already feeling about it, at 21, leaving undergrad with NO DEBT, I can already tell that I might just not have the stomach for this. I'm straight up thinking of just dropping everything and doing an MBA, because I know and feel that I would be good at doing whatever I want. I have a good ear for the type of you-want-it-but-didn't-know-you-wanted-it type entrepreneurial bullshit, but I just ... abhor that life, and I really do think one needs to buy into one's own hype to succeed in those fields. I've always been a good liar, but something just feels dirty about switching like that ...  \n",

In Russia, you have a right to a free higher education, as long as it is your first degree and your grades are fine. As I said, she's got a BA in English, so another bachelor's degree would be paid and too expensive for us to get, not to mention starting to get a degree at the age of 29 would mean that she'd get to actually doing science when she'll be going on 40. She's still got a right to a free master's, but getting in requires passing exams in many unrelated disciplines, such as ecology. Studying for those feels to be a major time loss.\n\nShe's been trying to get all the knowledge she can get (Coursera, EdX, various books) and she found a lab that lets her occasionally help out with the research they're doing (some cancer stuff), but she can't get over the feeling that without a specialized degree her options are extremely limited, that no matter how much she studies on her own she won't be allowed into proper science.\nShe worked for three months in Skolkovo as a lab technician, but after the unpaid trial period, she was refused the job because she has no degree (despite being qualified for the job and doing it better than some university graduates there).\n\nWhat are her options?",

I have three or four co-authors, all of whom are faculty (but who don't all know each other). This is a typical number in my field. I'm the first author, and the professor I collected the data with will be the senior author. His senior colleague, who supervised data collection, may or may not want to be on the paper. My advisor and another mentor from my institution are also on the paper. They know that they are both middle authors and they know who else is on the paper, although I'm not sure they know about the second possible senior author. At this point, it's basically a question of who is second vs third author. So far they've contributed about equally, although they haven't seen the draft manuscript yet, so one may end up doing more work on that.\n\nI have to imagine this is not at all a big deal to either of them, but because I am new to this process, I'm feeling stressed about the etiquette of the author order. It feels like I shouldn't decide on my own (especially as the most junior person on the paper), but I also don't know how or when to discuss it with them. I'm about to send around the first full draft of the manuscript—should I just not include the authors/title page? Should I include a preliminary list? Should I talk to them about it now (although I don't know who will do more work on the text)? Or do I actually just get to decide this by fiat? :)\n\nThank you for your counsel!",

In my search for doctoral programs, I have encountered a fantastic program in another country (Australia) that would involve working on a research project with three professors. There is a decent yearly stipend, and my tuition fees would be waived. The PhD is in Education, which is not my current discipline, however my research interests and current thesis topic fit perfectly within the scope of the research.\n\nI'm in the process of reading publications by the professor who is leading this research, and my next step will be to reach out to him in an email. After that, it looks like I need to apply to the institution as a general doctoral applicant, and then fill out some additional forms for the scholarship. My question is: how does one go about proposing their own research within the framework of a greater research project?\n\nThis is all kind of new to me, as my discipline typically lacks these kind of opportunities. I'm used to encountering programs that just require you to seek out a professor who has similar research interests, and then submit an application that involves a solid research proposal that could be supervised by said professor.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: This structure for PhD programs seems pretty typical for STEM based degrees, so perhaps STEM people may be able to add some additional insight!",

I only applied to ONE school because I was so sure that this was who I wanted to work with. I was accepted, fully funded, and have made lots of different arrangements in order to make this work as I am returning to school as a somewhat older student with a child. \n\nI received an email recently stating that my professor will be *resigning* (not retiring) as of next summer. This person intends to stay local and stay involved in the research area that I am pursuing, however they will not be an official faculty member. This person states that they do not think this will affect my experience in the program. \n\nI am not as confident, only because I spent time researching the other professors in the department when applying and did not find anyone who truly matched my research interests. Does this mean I will end up with a committee that either will try to change my research, or will not understand it? Is there any chance that I can be let go from the program as a result of my advisors choice to leave? Is there any chance that I will not have funding due to my advisors choice to leave? I have asked these questions to my advisor, as well, but would like outside opinions, if possible. \n\nWhat can I do in the upcoming year to ensure that I am best prepared for my advisor’s *resignation* (not retirement)? Other than, of course, establishing a good relationship with other faculty. \n\nThank you, in advance, for the advice!\n\nEdited in some bolds/etc because I think this person’s resignation is an important distinction vs a retirement.

        "text": "I have been offered a fully funded PhD (humanities, in the UK) and just spent a whole day (and a sleepless night) pondering whether I should accept it or not. I would really appreciate any advice! Basically:\n\nI have always planned to do a PhD at some point, but \"at some point\" is key here. I am currently finishing my MSc and planned to take a break from studying to pursue my professional career. My industry is extremely competitive but I am currently quite well equipped to get into an entry level position (I have done several internships, have good networks etc.). My main (only?) PhD-related worry is that dedicating three years to a PhD would harm my professional career - in three years I could have already moved on to a better paid managing position. Instead, by the end of it, I will be 29 with very limited industry experience.\n\nHowever. As I mentioned, a PhD is something that I have always wanted to do - I thrive in academia, enjoy research and I know that at some point I would want to do it for my personal development. I applied for this studentship despite the timing because this is such an incredible opportunity, with full funding (tuition and maintenance) and a really unique and interesting research question. The project involves some professional work at amazing companies, and the topic pretty much aligns perfectly with my personal interests. I knew that I would regret it if I hadn't tried, but it was so competitive that I never expected to actually get the place (hello, impostor syndrome).\n\nSo I suppose the question is, what do you think would be the best decision in my circumstances? Do I accept the offer and take those three years out of my professional career (assuming that I would get a job soon), or do I leave it and wait for another opportunity in the future? Any thoughts would be so appreciated!\n\n*EDIT*: Thank you so much for your comments, everyone! This thread has been so encouraging. After reading through it and speaking to my friends and family some more, I have to say that I am leaning towards accepting the offer. I will still take some more time to think that through but I've actually allowed myself to get excited about the idea of doing that PhD (and it feels great).",

        "text": "I have recently finished my PhD in biology, and loved it, but I am trying to decide whether I should stay in academia or not. I have received a postdoc offer at an overseas institution that suits my skills but is not a particularly desirable place to live. On the other hand I might soon be offered a government position in my home country, the main problem here being 'might'. I think I have a very good chance but of course nothing is certain. My main problem is lifestyle. I am really not sure if an academic life is for me - the constant moving and job uncertainty compounded with the pressure to work all the time and receive little back in the way of income. I want to live in my home country but academic opportunities are limited (and of course, highly competitive). Overall the government position would provide me with a better lifestyle (good location, good pay, meaningful work that uses my research skills), but that would mean leaving academia. At this point I am thinking of taking the gamble on the government job, but I hate the thought of having to turn down an otherwise good postdoc! I am sure there are many people here who have had to make decisions like this so I would love to hear your experiences and how you made your decisions.",

        "text": "One of my favorite professors (of philosophy, if that matters) was fired from my small, private liberal arts undergrad. He taught there for around 30 years, and from what I understand, was fired mostly as a result of politics, interpersonal dynamics, an air of suspicion, and via violations of policy. There’s a huge uproar from other faculty. He studied at Yale and Oxford, so he’s well accredited. He’s been a sort of unofficial advisor to me and generally just had a huge impact on my academic career. \n\nHe’s written references for me before, but now that he’s officially been fired, does that have a major impact on his reputation? I have a pretty strong CV and GPA (3.93 cumulative, 4.0 in philosophy major), along with two other strong references. I’m concerned that this development (which was formalized about a month ago; he was on sabbatical in the fall and came back to find a case against him) will negatively impact things. Am I overthinking it? Will philosophy grad programs know/care? \n\nI have a professor that I could ask for a reference from instead who I mentored for, but she’s on sabbatical for the 2018/2019 year (when I’ll be applying) and is generally terribly flaky. I asked her for a reference for a summer program and she never did it (despite repeated gentle reminders and her enthusiasm toward writing me a reference. She even helped me with my CV). \n\nTl;dr A normally-great reference was recently fired from my university. Is he still a good reference for applying to grad programs?",

Now to January probably isn't enough time to carry out a faculty search, and I don't think I have enough publications to be competitive for assistant professor jobs, anyway. \n\nMy goal has always been to have my own reasearch program. \n\nMy options are to: \n\n* Keep working with PI, get out second first author, apply for k99 in October, move with him in January, hope for uptick in successful experiments, start applying for faculty jobs soon after (this is expensive (multiple moves), and a move will be disruptive to productivity)\n* Keep working with PI, get out second first author, look for a second postdoc position, move, get out some publications and the start faculty search (will also require two moves, risks huge loss of productivity from new lab/project. I know several other people in my field looking for postdocs, so finding a job likely won't be a huge problem)\n* Keep working with PI, start applying to faculty jobs, hope I'm lucky and get something in the first few months\n* Quit academia because I'm not productive enough and go do something else?
