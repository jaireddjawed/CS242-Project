I’ve had about a dozen jobs and I’m at the point that I’m considering just going into a trade after I graduate college as a cs major and English teaching minor. I’ve always loved languages, helping others, solving problems, writing, and essentially anything with my hands and busy work but constantly dealing with rude and entitled customers is so miserable. I get jealous of people who have quit/put their two weeks in and I cannot do that because it’s hard to save money with my wages and I’d rather save a least a few thousand while job searching. I also don’t want to get another job dealing with customers; I love being busy and don’t mind actually doing something but the mental gymnastics of dealing with people and masking my emotions is too much sometimes",

I suppose it has something to do with the vagus and diaphragm?\n\nThe moment I notice this sensation, around 2 hours after taking Vyvanse, I also become aware that I feel more invested and that life feels richer and deeper. It gives me that extra contentment that tips me over to the \"snowballing positively\" side of life, instead of the inverse.\n\nWhat are your cues, and can you relate to anything in this post?",

We tried different dosages before switching to Vyvanse. Same problem.\nWe're back to the lowest possible dose of Adderall but I'm having the same problem.\nI'm feeling really stuck between a rock and a hard place: it's either have my anxiety under control but struggle with the ADHD symptoms, or do a bit better with my ADHD but have terrible anxiety that's equally as debilitating.\nGoing to go back to my psychiatrist and see what else we can do, but feeling very deflated and hopeless with it. I know meds don't work for everyone, but I was really hoping this could help me improve my quality of life .\n\nAnyone else had a similar experience or have any advice?",

        "text": "These recent events have been a bit of a whirlwind so please bear with me! \n\nMy wonderful partner once confided in me that when he was younger he was taken to the doctors over his behaviour, all he remembers is he never went back, but his parents wouldn’t speak about it. Instead they’d try and encourage exercise, and in his words “just give me what I wanted within reason”. He said this on our second date, frankly from the first time I met him he was literally screaming with ADHD. I suggested does he have adhd? And he said yes he thinks so but his parents refuse to speak about it, he’s never looked it up because he’s scared. I shared some resources with him (that he didn’t read lol!), so I read them with him. He said all of his life makes sense now, it was hard because at times he felt angry with himself and how things could’ve been different. \n\nAnyway, we go to the GP over something else (it took me 2 weeks to get him to go!), he wanted to ask about it and I brought it up as he was too nervous. The GP was so supportive and honestly it shocked me after hearing some horror stories. She booked him in for another telephone assessment with a different doctor. He was super nervous for the telephone appointment and wanted me there as he wanted to “say the right things”, I said just be yourself and be honest! She was super reassuring and reassured him even if he doesn’t want medication (which he doesn’t), it’s important to have a diagnosis and it sort of puts the pieces together. \n\nThis happened and he got referred to Psychiatry UK, through the NHS. What happens next? He’s kind of anxious about it all and is wanting to know what they’ll ask. So if anybody knows please let me know as he’ll be asking me up until the appointment if I know the questions haha. \n\nAlso, I’ll be honest, he has been in trouble with the police before, and he said he doesn’t want to tell them that. But I think it’s important as it really represents his impulsivity and lack of emotional regulation. Is this important to disclose if they ask? Do they ask about substance misuse? \n\nI really love this man, medicated or not, he honestly brings such spark to my life. I’m hoping maybe some therapy with help with his outbursts, as it’s not only hard on me, but also hard on him when he feels guilty for things he’s said or done.",

        "text": "I (21F) can't tell if the extent to which I struggle with procrastination is normal. To preface, I talked to my family doctor a few weeks ago and she said I have borderline ADHD, which still makes me wonder if I do have ADHD or not. In high school I would rely on deadline stress and my fear of not making my parents proud in order to achieve good grades. Now in university I don't experience deadline stress anymore and am not so hard on myself to get good grades so I won't start studying until the day before an exam. Besides work, it's not like I'm too busy to study. It feels like I am just unable to make myself start studying until the day, as I think to myself \"hey I should study so I don't fail,\" but even then I try not to stress myself out anymore because I stressed myself out so much in high school that I was perpetually living in fight or flight mode and blanketed by anxiety. So now that I don't beat myself up to do something, I won't do the thing. This experience most resembles with the idea of \"not caring\" or \"being lazy,\" but I refuse to believe what I'm going through is rooted in either of the two because I don't think I would be really questioning this if I didn't care. The experience I described (intentions not aligning with actions) does sound pretty ADHD, but I guess I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that there are some things I can't do. I hope someone can relate :c",

Is there anybody else that struggles to acquire dopamine even from some of their favorite activities? If I’m going to avoid doing something I should be doing, I’d at least like to find enjoyment in that other thing I’m doing instead. I’ve dealt with extreme depression in the past and this isn’t the same thing. Depression causes me misery and this is just lack of enjoyment, more of a constant boredom. Medication helps for about 3-4 hours a day to allow me to be somewhat productive and normal but even medication only works like 75% of the days I take it and if I take two doses even if it’s relatively early I absolutely can not sleep so l only got a few hours a day of normalcy no matter what. I’ve tried XR and that also has the same effect of causing me sleep disturbance. How am I supposed to function if 90% of the time I struggle to find enjoyment in pretty much anything? How am I supposed to improve my life if I don’t get that natural steady dopamine or serotonin production? Does anybody else find it particularly difficult to enjoy stuff even if it’s something you feel like you should enjoy?",

Although I'm born and raised in the Midwest, my heart belongs in the southwest.\nSo, it's a total shock to me that my most recent thing I'm doing is cold plunges.... In a frozen lake. \nLast week I did the Polar Plunge for the Special Olympics and I was amazed by the rush I felt. So I joined a thermogenesis Facebook group and have become part of the community for doing ice plunges. There's something about it being in nature too, not just a home bath with ice cubes.\n\nThe biggest reason I'm doing this is for controlling anxiety and practice of self soothing. I know when you're anxious, you're supposed to splash cold water in your face, and this is similar, I guess. \nI did my first dip today for 90-120 seconds and it was super uncomfortable, but I did it by focusing on my breath. I was forced to regulate my breathing when my body was essentially in fight or flight. \n\nMeditation is not easy for me because of my racing thoughts and ADHD brain, but this is a way I can meditate but it being active meditation. \n\nIdk just wanted to share that because I hate cold weather... Being cold etc....I barely like ice cream. I drink my water at room temp. Lol and here I am standing in a frozen lake in Minneapolis in March.",

It has made a gigantic difference in my life to the point where I feel I can function just as well as any other person for the most part. It's especially important as a student.\n\nSince I started taking it, I'd have a heart palpitation here and there and while I was a bit paranoid at first, they were infrequent enough where I just ignored them. But recently not only my sleep has been awful, but my heart is consistently out of rhythm. When my heart rates up from exercise the beat is steady, but it's when it slows down it goes out of wack. I'm fatigued, have a little bit of shortness of breath at rest and occasionally feel a little faint during an episode. With the frequency of this occurring, I think it's good grounds to bring it up to the doctor.\n\nI'm worried, though. I'm worried about my heart health, but I'm really worried about what will happen going forward. The medication has been a huge game changer. He might take me off the medication. I'm a little bit disoriented, but how should I bring it up to him? has anyone else had an experience with having heart issues and contactibg your doctor? what did they do?",

I always try to convince myself it’s not a big part of what I do but it it is. There’s so many media outlets that produce stuff about ADHD that is only seem as fun, silly, and energetic. It’s not all that, and even that part can be outrageous for people with Hyperactive ADHD. \n\nADHD is not just being hyper and being attention deficit either! It comes with so many side effects, especially when it comes to being a female at birth. It’s so hard having ADHD and remembering to do simply tasks such as taking medication, remembering appointments, and more. It’s tiring and confusing.\n\nIt is also extremely damaging to me personally when I only see positivity with ADHD problems. Now, I don’t mean how you accept those problems or how to solve them, I mean when people view them as funny and not that important. IT TRULY IS. Having to be different and hide the ADHD in yourself? Tiring. Forgetting hygiene and taking showers for months? Tiring. Even stuff such as “stimming” and “hyper fixation” and “adhd interests”. EXTREMELY TIRING. \n\nADHD is no fucking joke. You should not view it as a good part of your personality, heck even of yourself. It’s good if you accept that it’s apart of you that you cannot change, amd learn to grow and help yourself solve your personal issues but making others (specifically non-ADHD folk) only view it as a good thing is SO EXHAUSTING.",

        "text": "TL:DR - is it useful for a retired 68 year old to be told they could have ADHD?\n\nI'm currently waiting for the results of my ADHD assessment, but I took a long time to get to this point and I'd be very surprised if I don't get a diagnosis of ADHD.\n\nIt's recently clicked for me (and now it has, it seems so obvious and I don't know how it didn't occur to me sooner) that my mum has a lot of the same issues I do, and therefore may also have ADHD. For as long as I can remember, she's struggled with brain fog, being unable to get her words out in conversations and unable to focus on things if there's more than one thing happening like music is playing while she's trying to talk to someone, poor sleep and feeling overwhelmed by things, and has spent so much time seeing doctors who'd tell her she was depressed when she clearly wasn't, it was the menopause when she'd had these issues since way before that age, etc etc. She eventually found out that she's got an underactive thyroid and attributed many of her issues to that, but the medication for it hasn't really helped that much even though blood test results are now fine, and life is still quite difficult because she gets tired extremely easily after any kind of physical activity or being out and about (Overstimulated? Tired from masking?). \n\nThere are so many other things that point to ADHD, like she's a chronic oversharer who goes into minute detail about everything she's telling you about, and she's comedically tactless to the point that you can't quite believe she's just said that. Zero filter between brain and mouth. She's also very inflexible about things like punctuality, replying to messages, staying on top of finances etc, which I think could be a coping mechanism for avoiding it all getting out of control. Things she's told me about her childhood and adolescence also suggest ADHD.\n\nHOWEVER she and my stepdad are now retired (aged 68) and basically they can do what they want with their time, so she's much happier and only takes on what she feels she's able to do. \n\nIf I do get diagnosed with ADHD, I can't decide whether to tell her or not, because if I tell her and describe my symptoms then I suspect her reaction would be \"well I have those things too and I don't have ADHD\" and I'd have to be like \"yeah...about that.\"\n\nOn the one hand, I don't feel like I have the right to keep it to myself, but I don't know whether mentioning it might cause more harm than good. Obviously I can just tell her my symptoms and leave her to draw her own conclusions about herself, but I don't know whether that would be beneficial to her or not. It would have obviously been massively useful for her to know about this possibility earlier in life when she was struggling with things, but at this point, would it really make a positive difference or would it just be an unnecessary negative thing for her to deal with?\n\nWas anyone here diagnosed at this sort of age, or do you have a family member who was, and can you comment on whether it's made a positive difference?",

        "text": "I’ve been dealing with depression since my early twenties (late 30s now). The “level” of my depression oscillates between background noise and full on catatonic lethargy and besides a short six month stint of treatment with Lexapro (it didn’t help and made me fat) I haven’t ever done anything for professional treatment. I’ve gone through phases of closely watching my diet and exercising regularly, but it doesn’t seem to improve. In the last few years I’ve been learning a lot more about ADHD and feel like a veil of mystery around my behavior and thought patterns is being lifted. \n\nI recently learned about the service called Hims and they have a questionnaire that I filled out about my mental health and as a result they suggested Wellbutrin XL. \n\nI’m pretty skeptical of online pharmacy services so I recognize it might not be the most legit way to go about treating my depression and suspected ADHD, but I am at a loss for what else to do and barely have the energy or patience to go through a doctor. My fiancé thought it sounded super sketchy and made me promise to at least go to the doctor first to get their opinion. I mustered up the energy to make an appointment with a GP and went the other day and he just was kind of patronizing and told me that medication for mental health was a scam and that “studies are coming out that shows placebo to be just as effective”.\n\nAnyways I’m kind of forgetting what I even started this post for, but I guess it was to find out if I’m just completely going the wrong direction. Should I try Wellbutrin XL?",

        "text": "\n28/F I went to a new PCP to get back on anxiety medication. I thought this was going to go similarly as it had in the past and explain my symptoms and share history on anxiety, panic attacks and depression. In the past 6 months or so, I’ve seen information on adults with ADHD and found the symptoms to be relatable, but just figured that adhd and anxiety overlapped. After sharing how I was feeling with my doctor, I always feel like there’s a bunch of tabs open in my brain and have a hard time focusing, internally I can’t shut my brain off, forgetful, lose things, doing basic things like replying to emails/ texts feel like a challenge to do and have no energy because I constantly feel overwhelmed and overstimulated, etc. My doctor looked up from her computer and asked if I’ve ever been evaluated for ADHD. \n\nI never have and doctors in the past have always just treated anxiety and told me that anxiety doesn’t last forever and this will go away. I’ve been on a few different SSRIs before and always felt like on the outside I was calm, but on the inside my brain was always so loud and bouncing everywhere. I’ve been on anxiety meds off an on for the past 15 years and always felt like something was just wrong with me because I didn’t feel like my brain was normal compared to others around me. \n\nI don’t have an official diagnosis yet, but I have a referral to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and to be put on proper medication. For the first time in my adult life, I finally feel like a doctor heard me and wants to help. I feel like I have a chance at feeling like a functioning person that has motivation and is productive. Things from my childhood would make so much more sense. \n\n\nMy question for diagnosis, I guess, is what does the evaluation with a psychiatrist entail? Is it a series of questions and is it something that will need multiple sessions with the psychiatrist, or a one and done type thing.\n\n\nTLDR; PCP referred me to psychiatrist for ADHD diagnosis. What can I expect the evaluation and diagnosis process to be?",

        "text": "Hi, apologies in advance for this post being so long.\n\nIn December, I was on Wellbutrin for a little more than two weeks before I couldn't handle the side effects and decided to go off them (with my doctor's approval). In the past, I had to get off anti-depressants because of the intense brain fog, and Wellbutrin managed to trigger one of the worst depressive episodes I had had in a year, all within a couple of weeks. \n\nI wasn't going to try any more medication just because it went so poorly so quickly last time, but I only have a very light term left in uni so I wanted to try again since my issues haven't gone away. I had a visit with my PCP (different than the one who had prescribed wellbutrin) and because I was diagnosed with mild ADHD, she didn't want to prescribe anything specifically for ADHD. \n\nDuring the visit, I said I was looking for treatment that could help with my inability to stay focused, impulse control and executive dysfunction. To help with staying focus, I've taken advantage of some accommodations and I've really taken seriously some study advice for ADHD/inattention. The accommodations I've used are text-to-speech software for texts, alternative texts (to be able to use the software), audio-recording lectures, and getting access to powerpoints ahead of time (though powerpoints are already published usually). I guess I just want to make it clear that medication wasn't my first and only solution. Because while this is helpful when I can focus, I find myself really struggling with the same symptoms. I should also mention that when I had gotten diagnosed, my report mentions inattention, impulse control, executive dysfunction and working memory problems. So it's both my own experience and something that has been corroborated by a doctor. \n\nShe recommended that I find a therapist that could help with the lifestyle, since I don't have moderate/severe ADHD, and to find additional accommodations for school. I asked what other accommodations I should be asking for and she said to ask my university's academic department to see what they could offer. She prescribed me an anti-depressant that she said might help with inattention, but clarified it was not for ADHD or the issues I was talking about. \n\nI don't feel like depression is really the root cause of it all. I only say that because I've been on anti-depressents, and when they worked, I still experienced inattention/impulse control/executive dysfunction. I understand I'm not a doctor but it feels like none of what I am struggling with is being addressed, if that makes sense. \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar experience? Am I being too critical of her suggestions? I don't want to ignore medical advice but I just don't feel listened to at all. I'm a little concerned that I will take this medication and nothing will change, or things will worsen as it did with Wellbutrin. Any advice would be helpful as I'm just very afraid to make things worse for no reason. Or if I need to get my head out of my ass and just listen to my doctor, that would be good to know too.",

I find that sometimes ADHD can be quite triggering for my OCD, but at the same time, I also think that ADHD has made me have the ability to be focused on more things that I enjoy. This has actually helped me to calm the OCD triggers down when they happen. For example, I know what my special interests are so when I’ve had flares of OCD, I’ve known what I can do to bring myself some joy and relaxation.

She would have started me on Adderall but due to the ongoing shortage, she said it may be really difficult to get the medication and I was put on Ritalin IR to start out.\n\nSo far in the three weeks I've been taking it, I've had mixed results. She prescribed me 20mg and instructed me to start off taking half a pill per day, and increase to the full 20mg tablet after a week if it isn't enough. I only am able to take one a day, and I only take it when I really have to focus at work, or am studying as I'm a full time student and have a full time job.\n\nIt hasn't been life changing as a lot of threads on here have suggested. It works really well only some of the time. The first side effect I had was feeling slightly woozy at first but that has subsided. Now when I take it, sometimes it works really well, other times it'll work well but elevate my emotions (sometimes things irritate me a lot easier, or get upset/sad much easier). And it'll also make me really talkative and a little hyper. Sometimes it has absolutely no effect at all. My boss has mentioned that I seem a lot more \"on edge\" since starting the medication. A lot of the times it won't make my brain less scatterbrained but rather will make starting tasks, and following through with them easier.\n\nI have an appointment next week with my doctor to go over the symptoms and am not sure if maybe continuing on Ritalin would be best or if I should switch to another medication. A few of my friends with ADHD have been on Ritalin and all of them had mentioned that Adderall worked better for them and I want to try that, but I'm not sure how the shortage of it will have an effect on me. I also want to discuss more long acting versions of medications as I work 10 hour shifts, and then study a lot so the 1 pill a day that lasts for 3-5 hours isn't enough for me.\n\nYou guys got any suggestions?",
