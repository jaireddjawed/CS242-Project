I feel like people’s fascination with her life story and tragic death often distract people from the genius of her work despite drawing attention to it. As a 19 year old college student myself, I see Esther Greenwood in the Bell Jar as the most real and honest protagonist I’ve ever read. She is witty, observant, and incredibly aware. Sylvia Plath presents this character who is representative of herself in a very objective manner, not creating a character any more or less virtuous than reality. She recognizes the intrigue of her struggle and yet does not dramatize it as we know she is marvelously capable and talented at doing in her poetry. The book reads like a conscience that I genuinely feel could be my own in the same circumstance. \nShe illuminated to me the idea of intuition as something of a virtue in other people, and it makes so much sense to me in the context of her writing, and has become something I aspire to develop in my own character, despite being an “American guy” whom she suggests generally lack such a quality. \n\nPlease share any thoughts you have about her novel or poetry, anything particularly striking that you’ve garnered from reading her work.\nThanks for taking the time to read this!",
