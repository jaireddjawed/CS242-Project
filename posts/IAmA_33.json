I have submitted proof to the mods as I must keep my company affiliations anonymous. \n\nMy work encompasses renewable energies, handling the growing issues of our landfills, and water quality. We live in a world that is allowing asbestos back into the trade industry and a ruler that broke ties on working to combat greenhouse emissions. \n\nAfter Trump broke ties with the Paris Agreement, the city of Atlanta responded by being the biggest southern city to commit to 100% clean energy. The financial and legal complexities of this goal are astronomical. I'm here to honestly answer your questions as we hope to make this goal a reality. AMA!\n\nLink to Atlanta's 2035 goal: https://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/05/atlanta-commits-100-renewable-energy-2035\n\n*Proof submitted to mods\nAMA to begin 7:45 ET (8/8/2018)\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up overnight! Excited for everyone's interest and involvement. I have meetings most of the day, but I will try to answer as many questions as I can get to. Keep them coming!\n\nEdit 2: I've been asked a lot of questions about making it in this career field, so I'll just put a little comment in up here. My best advice to you all is to get certifications in whatever area of environmental science you are interested in working in. If it's wetlands, WPIT. If it's hazardous materials, CHMM. Also, consider getting a graduate degree. A master's degree with a certification or two will really help you stand out. It's a rewarding field to be in.\n\nEdit 3: Alright guys, thanks for all the questions but it's time to sign off. Hopefully this AMA not only spread the word for our 2035 goal but also made an individual impact in encouraging environmental consciousness. Thanks Reddit!",

From there, we continued to grow, relocating to Old Saybrook, CT then to our current location in Milford, CT in early 2014 where we continue to support the local enthusiast community with Cars &amp; Coffee events and local charity drives. Several years ago, at a much smaller size, I held [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1u96rp/iama_ceo_of_a_15_million_online_auto_parts_store/) and having continued to grow I figured it was a good time to follow up!\n\nIâ€™m open to discussing all aspects of the company weâ€™ve built - including our technology, web development and creative team, strategic planning and execution, marketing, sales, call center/ service team, warehouse and distribution, operations, financing strategy, how to buy a car, why we have race cars, our growing online media division, or even my time spent as a barber giving fades and haircuts in my dorm room.\n\nProof: [On Twitter](https://twitter.com/FCPEuro/status/1027566447588007937)",

This condition only affects roughly 2 million people worldwide. I've got a sense of humor and I can sit here for a WHILE. If this somehow blows up, I will absolutely respond to every single question. Do your worst, Reddit.\n\n\nMy Proof: I can't quite PROVE that my heart stopped for the specified 6 minutes but I can surely show ya some of my hospital metabolic results from the day it happened. The second link is a news story about a fundraiser I had a while ago (which the youtubers Drift0r and Boogie2988 REALLY helped with), the update story, and a picture of that particular hospital stay with the anonymous benefactor visiting me...he brought the current and previous Ms. Nebraska because he could. Literally no other reason than to cheer me up and I apologize for this section being so long. I'd be doing an utter disservice to everyone who helped if I didn't, regardless of if they ever see this. \n\n\nMetabolic panel... And Ms. Nebraska(s): https://imgur.com/a/rEkEBoB\n\nOriginal Story: http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Young-Man-Hopes-for-Mobility-in-His-Future-277495811.html\n\nUpdate: http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Teen-Gets-Surprise-From-Anonymous-Viewer-Who-Saw-WOWT-Story-286596241.html\n\nDrift0r video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRj9ZthylU&amp;t=\n\n\nI know that AMAs are supposed to be very unique, but I also really hope that this doesn't come off as a bragging post. As I started to type I just started to realize more and more about how blessed I've been despite the circumstances. AMA! \n\nEdit: probably best to have a better starting point. Like the name implies, Spinal Muscular Atrophy affects your muscles. Biologically much different, but in reality it's a slower paced ALS. All voluntary muscles slowly deteriorate over time. The most important one being your diaphragm. \n\nEdit 2:I should've went to bed hours ago but this was so damn fun.

Also I expect some blowback about why I am not leaving yet, and it is because I see no reason to sit in a hotel room rather than my house until I have to leave. ",

Our club is comprised of local beekeepers of various experience levels, wanna-beekeepers aiming to get bees of their own, and folks who just love bees and want to learn more about them. We meet up monthly to share field-specific info, beekeeping techniques, and generate a positive buzz for Apis mellifera! [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NewOrleansBeekeepers) is a great resource for folks looking for bee removal and relocation services.\n \nAs far as my personal expertise, I've only been keeping bees for four years, but I've always loved animals, and Iâ€™ve spent the last decade teaching at zoos and museums. I most recently taught at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans, where I â€“ along with my colleague, friend, and fellow club member, Dominique Fleitas â€“ reestablished the on-grounds apiary program and pollinator garden. We also presented at the Louisiana Beekeepers Association annual conference and spring field day. I left the zoo back in March and have since been in the process of channeling my passion for beekeeping into something bigger by expanding my small-scale apiary operation, [beespoke nola](https://www.facebook.com/beespokenola), into a pollinator conservation outreach program and mentorship gig. \n\nAMA!\n \n \n**PROOF:** [https://twitter.com/NOLAnews/status/1026472499893202944](https://twitter.com/NOLAnews/status/1026472499893202944)",

NTSB investigators like me are launched to major accidents soon after they occur to begin investigations on-scene.\n\nIn my capacity as an NTSB investigator, I investigate the human factors of highway accidents across the United States, including distraction, fatigue, training, licensing, and toxicology. The study of human factors is where engineering and psychology overlap, and because investigating how humans interact with vehicles is key to improving traffic safety, the NTSB uses human factors specialists in its investigations.\n\nSince joining the NTSB in 2001, Iâ€™ve investigated over 100 accidents across the country, including:\n\n\\- Biloxi, MS (bus-train collision)\n\n\\- Davis, OK (truck collision involving synthetic marijuana)\n\n\\- Cooper Township, MI (truck-cyclists collision)\n\n\\- Cranbury, NJ (fatigue, Tracy Morgan)\n\n\\- Santa Monica, CA Farmer's Market (pedal misapplication)\n\n\\- Minneapolis, MN (I-35W Collapse)\n\n\\- Munfordville, KY (cell phone use)\n\n\\- Boston, MA (the Big Dig)\n\n\\- Mount Vernon, WA (pilot car bridge collapse)\n\n\\- Orland, CA (motor coach fire)\n\nI have an M.S. and a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech and Iâ€™ve been studying the human factors of driving for over 18 years. Thanks for having me, Redditâ€”AMA!\n\n**Proof:** [https://truepic.com/p0svp8q9/](https://truepic.com/p0svp8q9/)\n\n**Cooler proof:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/uOvEifM](https://imgur.com/gallery/uOvEifM)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All opinions presented are my own and do not necessarily reflect the position of the NTSB on any given topic, and not all questions or comments will be answered or acknowledged (though weâ€™ll do our best to answer every relevant question we can)! I am also not permitted to disclose information on ongoing investigations; the most recent investigation Iâ€™ll be able to address is the Biloxi, MS bus-train collision, which concluded with a Board Meeting yesterday.\n\nFollow NTSB on social media for more: twitter.com/ntsb, instagram.com/ntsbgov, facebook.com/ntsbgov, youtube.com/user/ntsbgov, flickr.com/photos/ntsb, [https://safetycompass.wordpress.com/](https://safetycompass.wordpress.com/) and check out our website for investigation reports and updates: [ntsb.gov](https://ntsb.gov)\n\n**Edit:** I'll be answering questions in chunks on and off until about 5PM, so I apologize if there's a delay in my responses, but I'll get to as many questions as I can!",
