        "text": "I lived in the home for a few years. I could always feel something was a little bit off but I chalked it up to just being kinda old. however there was this corner at the top of the stairs where a particular shadow was always cast, but felt so unnatural. I suspected something in my room too, but their vibes were friendly, so that never bugged me. \n\n  \nOne night I was downstairs in the kitchen with my dog. i was at the table in The farthest corner away from the staircase and enjoying my midnight dinner of a microwave Alfredo chicken pasta. 10/10 would recommend. I was simply eating when I started to feel more off than normal.   \ni again thought “oh, it’s night and I’m here alone, of course my anxiety is gonna kick in.”   \nbut then I heard footsteps. Very distinctly I could hear them coming down the stairs. I thought it was my brother so I looked around the corner to say hi, but I didn’t see anything. I thought it was nothing until I noticed them coming close, following the path I had taken to the kitchen. \n\nnot onky did I look up, but my dog did too I knew she saw it too because she looked exactly at he shadow I saw. I didn’t know what to do, this one in particular had felt angry before, but not at all dangerous. I looked in the direction I could feel him standing and just said “hi” really awkwardly.   \n\n\nthe footsteps then turned back around and the shape disappeared. He went back to his spot on the stairs. I wasnt so afraid of the shadow in the stairs again. I think he was just saying hi too.",

        "text": "TW: Long Crazy Story. Events over the course of a year or so.\n      Okay so, back in my late teens earlier 20s (25M) I had an odd experience and I still don't fully know what it exactly was. I've done some research but I can't seem to just get full closure on the whole thing.        \n\n       When I was in the marine corps I'd party alot, (imagine that) well one night in a half drunken stupor we started messing with a ouija board. Bad idea I know, but after that things started to get weird. I'd be in certain places where I'd feel a weird presence, one instance that sticks out to me was a walk back with my buddy to his car leaving a party at USC, and we went down this alleyway and I just had this eerie feeling, like I was being followed/watched.\n         \n         Well, fast forward a couple months and I'm in bed with my GF at the time and I would start to doze off only to stir due to me instantly dreaming as I started to doze, the weird thing, in my dream I had been in these places that were aforementioned. Like I said these things went on for awhile and it was a deja vu experience, I'd be in these places I'd been where I'd gotten that feeling only to turn around and I could actually see this figure now. The alleyway situation I saw it in full form, tall, hulking figure, with large hands and extremely long fingers that were like daggers. But it was a silhouette. Could feel blood rushing thru my ears as I'd see this thing in my dreams. Almost as if I could hear my blood flow thru my veins. I eventually stirred enough to wake my GF and she said a prayer and I was instantly out the rest of the night no issue. Over the course of the next few weeks had a couple weird instances here and there light flicker etc. \n  \n        Fast forward a few months, I see this thing in a dream again, and this time, I couldn't move, couldn't wake up, and it lunged at me, and I could feel it choke me thru my dream. I woke up out of breath to see it at the foot of my bed. And I had never seen it again. \n\n        Since then I've been very in tune with things as I've noticed, almost as if maybe the experience has made me able to sense spirits etc? Can that happen or is that just me being more in tune with my sixth sense? I've talked with a Navy Chaplain the morning after I had been attacked, he seemed to think it was demonic. I've done some research and and I think I found out who the entity was (Asmodeus), but I'm not positive maybe someone has had a similar experience. Maybe someone with some more in depth knowledge might be able to shed some light. Sorry for the storybook guys.",

        "text": "This just happened 2 nights ago. This is still fresh in my memory. My pup (I just adopted one last week) had been crying since he's not used to sleeping alone so I've decided to study beside him to calm him down. As I have observed, he is generally a quiet pup and so I was surprised as to how he was behaving that night. I tried to shush him when his cries were growing louder, however, I was too tired to continuously do so since it's already 2 am. I let him cry thinking that pups may sometimes do so. \n\nIt was almost 3am when my pup barked once again. Suddenly there was a loud \"Ssshhhhh\" sound with a bit of almost like a hot breathe near my ear. I got goosebumps all over my body. My pup then burst-cry and barked ferociously at nothing, then peed in fear. I hugged him out of fear while we hide under the sheets. \n\nHe barked almost the whole night. Now, I'm scared of my own house.  \n\nPs. Is this the right subreddit to post this? send help. thanks.",

My partner and I were watching The Babadook the other day, and suddenly, my partner's phone started playing \"I'm not alone\" by Calvin Harris (CamelPhat Remix) on Apple iTunes Music (or whatever it's called). First, neither of us uses the Apple music player, and neither of us likes Calvin Harris (we like CamelPhat, though). Second, neither of us touched the phone - it was behind us.\n\nOther things have freaked out my partner, like one of our curtain strips moving as if someone had touched it. I had the google nest say, \"it was nice having a conversation with you\" the other day when I was asleep - it woke me up, obviously, but I was in no mood to fight a ghost, so I fell back asleep (actually, I just thought it was a glitch in the software and didn't bother). But now, after all this spooky shit, I'm thinking either everything we own is glitchy or something is messing with us.  \n\nIf there's something, it better leave unless it wants to help with the rent. LOL.\n\nAnd no, it was not the Babadook LOL; it's a decent movie... not too scary.",

        "text": "I live in a provincial area here in the Philippines near the shore. This incident happened while my cousin (17M) and I (16M) were over at our neighbour's house on Sunday, two nights ago. My cousin suddenly received a call from my mother irritatingly asking (in Tagalog) when he intends to come back to the house. Upon our arrival home, my mother -- who just came out of the bathroom -- was oddly furious. She asked me why I locked my bedroom door and why I would not open it, which naturally left me confused since I was not in there to begin with nor did I even lock my door before leaving. I told her I wasn't in there and was with my cousin at our neighbour's house which made her silent for a while before she began furiously ranting about something inconsequential, then angrily striding back to her bedroom and shutting her door. That night I stayed in bed trying to sleep since I was tired and had no Internet connection, but I could not sleep until midnight because of a negative aura pervading the room.    \nAfternoon the next day, my mother called me to the living room while sitting on a couch and explained the reason for her atypical frustration the night before. She said she had been knocking on my door asking if Tobi (our cat) was with me. She knocked again and again and called my name, and then distinctly heard my voice in the room loudly say, 'What?!' Then she angrily asked 'me' if I was going to open my door or not, and then she heard Tobi crying inside my room. That's when (as an expression of her anger, I suppose) she turned the family WiFi off and called my cousin on the phone -- leading to what I said transpired earlier. Hearing what she said gave me elated goosebumps, and I considered the possibility that a spirit / discarnate entity was impersonating me, so I made my intent mentally known to my surroundings that whatever discarnate entities were out there, they ought to make their existence known to me, and I would welcome their presence; then today, as I felt a sudden urge to browse the Glitch in the Matrix subreddit, I came across a comment on a post mentioning the Vardøger phenomenon, which made me study it a bit further:   \n1.) \"The Vardøger is a creature with origins in Norse mythology, legend and folklore. In particular, it is a spirit closely associated to the metaphysical psychological experiences of autoscopy, bilocation, and déjà vu; and is considered to be a type of Doppelgänger (spirit doubles that are generally said to be bad omens, foretelling illness, evil plans, or even death).\"   \n2.) \"...some consider the Vardøger to be something of a trickster, this is simply due to the creature going out before the person to whom it is bound, to announce that person's impending arrival.\"   \n3.) \"Those not used to the phenomenon of the creature's arrival will go out and check to see who is there, and for a second will see a person, who will disappear, or they will see no one at all. Shortly after, the person they originally saw (\\*\\*or whose voice\\*\\* or scent preceded them) will arrive.\"   \n4.) \"...they are masters at mimicking the person whose arrival they precede. They move, speak, act as the person does. More than anything, they seem to be a person's own personal poltergeist.\"   \nI find it highly likely that my mother did experience this Vardøger phenomenon, but I am open to any other interpretations from the community -- hence my disclosure. In addition to this incident, any thoughts/advice pertaining to the following would be greatly appreciated:   \n\\- Daily and variegated synchronicities -- e.g., seeing a wolf-like figure in my mind's eye, spontaneously answering a spirit animal survey, being assigned a wolf, being provided with the following statement: \"When the wolf shows up in your life, pay attention to what your intuition is telling you,\" and a little while thereafter, discovering a wolfdog during a walk in an area I deem special, going home and being greeted with \"10:01 AM, today, at 01/10 (1 Oct, 10 days before my birthday: 11/10)\"   \n\\- Sporadic strange events -- e.g., a seemingly psychokinetic experience while supervising my baby sister; a sudden encounter with a white UFO tic tac while climbing a steep mound; or my disabled younger stepbrother who, just before my cousins moved in, would abnormally sneak out late at night to hide under the house in a squatted position, laughing unaccompanied -- and who recently fell and hit his forehead, bleeding, exactly one year after a similar experience (early December); or me occasionally experiencing sudden muting, then a brief tinnitus-like ringing specifically in my right ear, then normalization just before heading to sleep -- and waking up feeling drained and indolent, irrespective of sleep duration   \n\\- Feelings and experiences of being haunted or targeted by some invisible discarnate entity (or entities); certain people coming to my life (as though deliberately placed) during certain junctures to delay me from achieving certain goals or outcomes; misfortunate events happening exponentially; a heavy intuition that global extraterrestrial disclosure, extensive globalization of society, extreme mass enslavement for a parasitic overclass of elites, and other extreme and radical events are imminent   \nThanks for your attention",

        "text": "In 2017 I was on a family holiday to South Africa (My mum is South African so we go every year to visit family etc) and we had landed in Johannesburg airport after flying in from Manchester. It was night time and we I was travelling with my Mum, Dad, Brother and and my dad’s friend from school. My mum, brother and dad’s friend were in the car in front and me and my dad were in the car behind (we had two cars as my dad and his friend were going home a week earlier than the rest of us).\n\nOn the way of travelling from Johannesburg to Nelspruit I distinctly remember a bright white light fill the sky, almost like the sun, except much bigger and it was almost night time so it was very dark aside from street lights. Anyone who has driven down the motorway from Johannesburg to Nelspruit knows it’s just a long straight road in barren landscape. This bright light I saw around 100km out of Johannesburg (it’s around 350km to Nelspruit).\n\nAt around the 275km point on the journey you can either go through a mountain range which is much quicker or go around which is slower but also less risky, but the mountainous one really isn’t dangerous. We go down the mountainous one and we son find they are having massive road works where you wait for around 10 - 20 mins before you can go so there will be no car on the other side of the road. There is a timber truck in front of us and just a normal cargo truck behind us. Whilst we are driving the wheel of the cargo truck in front of us explodes and starts swerving massively and like tyre smoke I think goes everywhere. We and my family in the car in front managed to swerve out the way onto the empty opposite side of the road. The truck behind me and my dad went straight into the back of the timber truck causing a massive crash, we kept driving as stopping in places like this in South Africa is discouraged, which isn’t humane of us but when you hear the stories about what happens to people who stop it makes sense.\n\nI can’t help but think that this massive bright white light I saw in the sky was like a guardian angel or something? I know it sounds crazy but my dad and I were mere seconds away from death if it weren’t for the fact there were roadworks taking place. This has always stuck with me and confuses me to this day.",

I mean I know that these things probably do exist but it’s not smth I’m obsessed with or think about all the time.\n\n\nI do however have one story (encounter maybe?) from ~15+ yrs ago that I can’t seem to forget. And I’m curious to hear what you guys think. \n\n\nI was 13-14 and was coming back from my math tutoring class. It was winter, very snowy and it was maybe 6-7pm. It was dark and quiet outside, the street was also dead, but the street lights were on. I was maybe 500m away from my house when I saw a man maybe 15-20m away walking towards me. What I remember is that he was quite short and bulky, walked slowly too, but I didn’t see him well. Some time later I realized that his that his shape/walk reminded me of the Penguin from the Batman movie played by Danny Devito (just fyi I wasn’t obsessed with the movie or the character and it’s not smth I just imagined).\n\n\nAnyway, I didn’t pay much attention to him, but as he was approaching, I looked at his face. It was EXACTLY like my father’s face. Also fyi my dad is alive and well, and he’s much taller and thinner. So it was as if his EXACT face was plastered on this short and bulky man. (Also, I had a perfect vision that time).\n\n\nHe slowly passed by and didn’t stop. I don’t  think he even looked at me. I continued walking. It took me 10 ish seconds to realize what I saw. By that time he was already 8-10 m behind me. \n\n\nI stopped and turned back. And fuck. Apparently he also stopped a few seconds before me. And he was turned towards me. He was just standing there for a few seconds just staring at me, while I was looking at him. He didn’t say a word. We were just staring at each other for a bit. Then he just turned away and continued slowly walking in the opposite direction.\n\n\nI didn’t see him ever again either. Which on one hand makes sense but I also lived in a small town and knew my neighbourhood quite well (ie I saw the same people often). \n\n\nI still don’t know what that was. Could it be smth paranormal? Or just a random creepy coincidence? Like I did NOT expect he would be turned back exactly when I turned back. And his face too..It was my dad’s face 100%. Same moustache, nose, eyes, everything. And imagine two strangers just staring at each other for some time  seemingly for no reason. Like it’s not smth you do with a stranger. \n\n\nWhat do you think that was??\n\nThank you",

        "text": " Hi-  I am not sure which group to post this in.   I have had the strangest experience.. I never knew about signs and all before I lost my dad..  I am going to post this in another group too and here, if it is accepted.     Not sure if should take the photo to a priest --  a medium?  I never believed in Mediums...really.................     \n\nMy dad was my best friend and his loss was a sudden shock to me. Though he had a stroke, I thought he would pull through, as he had made it far. I prayed every day for him for years-- ever since he retired and was sad from that. Daily prayers -- especially Padre Pio's healing novena while he was in the hospital and rehab.\n\nI received amazing signs-- cardinals-- at his table outside almost immediately after he left us. Other signs, too, one being so crazy at a beach, which have comforted me.\n\nBut the strangest thing has now happened. I took a picture of something special that was sent in the mail. Sent it fast to my sister and she says - who is that man in the photo? I didn't see anything at all. Then I looked closer and it is the image of my dad - in his favorite outfit he used to wear out every day, with his head bowed down. I enlarge the photo- and there is a man's figure straight above him-- The face looks exactly like Padre Pio, and he is wearing a robe. My husband doesn't see this in the photo. My sister does but she is not aware of Padre Pio is. I feel like anyone I talk to about this will think I am crazy. Would a priest be open to seeing this picture and talking about it with me? It brings me comfort but also makes me uneasy... it is so unbelievable.\n\nAlso, I stopped praying to Padre Pio the day my dad died. I was angry, too sad. I started praying to him the day I took this picture..unknowingly what was in it..",

        "text": "So for a little context I stay in central scotland, and don't believe in ghosts or anything paranormal really despite having these 2 experiences and another one which has really effected me, but I still choose to try and not think about what it may have been.\n\nThese happened probably about 2/3 years ago now so not recent, but my friend recently admitted to me that recently he has had something similar happen (stay 2 doors down from me) so I thought I'd let this sub help us to get some peace at mind.\n\nThe first experience I had was one night when I was home alone and going to sleep (these only happened when home alone) when I was disturbed by what sounded like one of my cats scratching at my brothers door.( my door was the only one that was open since the cats are in and out all night) but instead of scratching at the carpet like they usually do, it was like they were scratching at the actual door itself with they're claws out, but something felt off so I didn't make a move.\n\nIt felt way to heavy to be my cats and it went on for minutes. At this point I was already kind of freaked out but immediately after stopping I could hear whatever it was darting from my brothers door at the end of the hall to the top of the stairs at the other end over and over again. Anybody who owns cats knows that thwy do strange things like that every once in a while but I knew that this wasn't either of them, besides the heavy one out the both was at the foot of my bed. It sounded like it had alot of weight, like a large dog almost, and it was impossibly fast. It changed directions like it was nothing and darted the whole length of the hall in what felt like less than half a second. This went on for a couple minutes as I started getting more terrified.\n\nEventually it stopped at my door and that's when I remembered that it was open and Mt heart honestly nearly burst. I could hear it sort of push my door open with its head and heavy breathing, almost like a humans, before it let out a really low pitched growl and it just disappeared. Absolutely nothing else for ages. It messed me up but with time I forgot about it and didn't mention it to anybody else. That was until a few weeks ago.\n\nI won't detail exactly what happened as it was practically the same, with the exception that I could hear it interact with things on the opposite sides of my parents room over and over at impossible speeds. Once that happened ans I decided to tell ny friend thats when he told me of his experience. It sends chills down my spine knowing that it isn't just my imagination playing tricks. I'd lile to know I'd anybody else has any similar experiences or any clue of what it could have been.",

        "text": "Since I was young I would get very bad anxiety at bed time.Around 10 I developed a fear of the dark and would feel my parents of scary things like hearing my name yelled that would bring me out of sleep as if it was in my ear. Or that feeling you get when you're being watched.  I had thought I'd it grown it.  I (26f) have been living alone in a quite old apartment . I've lived here over a year at this point and up till a few months ago I never felt uncomfortable alone here. Then one night about 3 months ago I started feeling that feeling of being watched at bed time, or when I showered. I simply thought it was just anxiety and kinda was laughing at myself for it. Until I was in bed one night and I felt it coming through my entry closet that leads to my restroom. I leave the light in there on to prevent tripping. That night I felt the insatiable feeling something was watching me from I'm there. The pull string light suddenly clicks it self off. Of course I freak out turn on all my bed room light and check out the scene. To my dismay the light is fine. Not burned out turns right back on when I pull it. And I don't feel this watching again for several weeks. It doesn't feel like it means harm but it is uncomfortable. And possibly coincidence and paranoia from living in such a old building. What do you guys think in should do? Of what do you think is happening.  Please don't go and try to scare me thanks in advance",

        "text": "I want to start off by saying I was a believer in the paranormal before these experiences and I have had more than one experience that I cannot explain, but this one is by far the scariest. To give a little background this was a couple of years ago shortly after the passing of my partner. We were together almost 10 years so at this point I was truly at my lowest. I had seen an article on the internet talking about contacting loved ones on the other side and before this I would have never even considered trying it. I turned off all the lights in my room and I lit a candle (just a normal scented one). I did not have a ouija board. I was too afraid to go to that extent. At this point I was kind of skeptical that anything would happen considering I was not following through with exactly how the article had said to do it. Once I lit the candle I called out to my partner asking if they were there. Nothing happened. The second time I called out immediately everything went pitch black. Where I live there are not many street lights or anything so I could not even see my hand in front of my face. At that moment I was not thinking that the power had went out, but for some reason I thought I had left my room completely. I know that doesn’t make sense. There was no bad weather that night or high wind. First I tried to feel for my phone and I couldn’t find it I jumped up and ran until I hit the wall feeling for the door handle or light switch at this point I just started screaming. Then my mom swung the door open asking why I was screaming and that it was okay the power just went out. It took about 10 minutes before the power came back. I know to some this may have been a coincidence, but I truly believe it was paranormal. I had a few experiences after doing this. Even at one point had seen  a shadow that looked like my partner sitting in a corner. I will never mess with anything like that again. I may delete this later idk. I just wanted to hear some thoughts from others. I also want to add. I did mention I had a candle lit, but when it went pitch black I’m not sure what happened to the candle or how it went out. I was in such a panic to get out I do not recall. I just remember not being able to see anything at all.",

        "text": "My grandpa was diagnosed with cancer about three years ago. The doctors said he wouldn’t make it much longer, so I decided to move in with my grandparents to help care for him (my grandma is disabled, so she couldn’t do it on her own). He ended up living for two years after his initial diagnosis. During this time, he and I got very close. We talked about death and the afterlife a lot and he was aware of my skepticism. One day, he told me he would send me a sign if there’s something out there. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to his last few days. He was losing his mind more and more everyday: he was even convinced he was already dead at one point. I was the last person he talked to before he went into a comatose-like state. He told me he loved me so much.\n\nThe next day, he died in our living room. It was really surreal. I kind of blocked everything out because I had never been so close to death. We had to wait for the hospice nurse to pronounce him dead and then for the coroners to pick him up. He laid there for like five hours before the nurse showed up and I never moved from his side. After the coroners came, I gave his body a kiss, told him I loved him, and went upstairs because I didn’t want to see them put him in a body bag or something. When I got up to my room, I just sat in my bed in this weird daze. I have this touch activated light on my desk, which is on the other side of my room. It turned on by itself. I didn’t think anything about it at first, so I went and turned it off and returned to my bed. Then it turned on again. I turned it off again. Sat in bed again. Then again. Three times. On its own. The last time I got up to turn it off, it connected in my mind. The mirror sits on a leather box my grandpa gave me. It had all of his cuff links and misc. sentimental items in it. \n\nI am by no means spiritual or religious, so this experience has left me confused for over a year. I want to believe that he was “sending me a message”, but it contradicts everything that I’ve ever believed in. Is this most likely just an odd coincidence or is it possible that he tried to contact me?",

I know in alot of ghost hunting videos people say that the air feels \"Heavier\" in haunted areas but that could be the human brain tricking you as well.\n\nMy expierence is associated with my home. I'm a 22yo male and own my home. I purchased the house in Februrary a few months after my mothers(45) passing. I feel like my moms spirit has attached to my home after following me here from my grandparents, which is where I had stayed prior to moving here along with their house being where my mom passed away. The first time I had stepped in the house after closing on it, I felt this energy attached to the house, but it was a very familiar energy. I cant necessarily saw its my moms spiritual energy but its the only one that makes sense to me.\n\nMy mom and I were really close along with me being her only child, she always tried to look out for me and even seems that way after shes no longer physically here. But even when im alone in the house I dont feel alone.\n\nNow the main reason for posting this is to see if theres any theories about spirits giving off Auras of uplifting emotional energy. My house has always had this uplifting energy to me and seems to have gotten stronger as of today. Also would certain decorations amply these effects to the spirits? I put up outdoor and indoor Christmas decorations today and feel like that has contributed to this, My mom always loved Christmas. But it is also almost the one year anniversary of my moms passing so that could be contributing to this as well.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts and opinions and if I can provide more information or clarfication, I will try.",

        "text": "This personal story is one that happened many years ago, and it's not a fuzzy memory. It's something that happened that was clear as day. A glass object exploded before my eyes. So what happened?\n\nNow to be clear, I do not believe in the paranormal. I'm on this sub because I love reading about spooky things and I like to see what other people believe about the world. But this was really weird and I think some folks might have thoughts about it.\n\nI was having lunch in my backyard with my parents and grandparents one summer. Just inside, visible through the glass sliding door, is a buffet table of sandwich stuff and just outside of that door is the outdoor table we are eating at. \n\nI'm sitting at the table in a position that is facing the glass door to the inside, and as I start to zone out from the conversations around me, my gaze settles on a small glass bowl of guacamole. A moment passes, and then POP! Glass shards and guac fly all over the table, and the bowl is no more. It was sitting on the table one moment, and the next it exploded just as I stare and zone out on it.\n\nThe bowl had not been heat washed pior (I asked several times if it had been) nor was it in any way structurally compromised. It was sitting in our cabinet and then filled about half way with homemade guac.\n\nMy dad and I are both scientifically minded atheists. He has a masters in thermodynamics, so he understands heat and what it does to materials, and he assured me that the glass bowl had not gotten hot any time recently. Neither of us could think of an explanation. Pretty creepy!\n\nNowadays I have a hypothesis. The glass bowl had been pressed into an ornate design when it was in the factory, I believe. When that happens to glass and it's forced to cool in a shape quickly rather than being blown, it contains extreme internal stress. It's unlikely, but that seems to have been the moment it finally gave out after about 2 decades of use. What do you think?",

In the dream I had woke up on the right side of the bed where the closet and the dresser is and it's like mid dark in the room I look over to my left side and there was a shadow figure standing over the bed watching me it grabbed the cover and pulled the cover with me going with it I took my leg and stopped myself with the wall to prevent me from falling on the floor why I did that I have no idea it went blank for a second then I woke up again on the right side of the bed laying there in front of me there was the little boy but his face was like distorted in a way I can't explain and at the foot of the bed there was another shadow figure sitting there watching me sleep I am still having the dream right ok so I sat myself up and that's when the little boy's jaw started to dislocate and it looked terrifying everything went blank again for a quick second I opened my eyes again I was laying down still in the dream but it's like repeating itself I decided not to get up or look around I just stayed there that's when I started to hear voices and before I woke up the voices said, \"remember (myname) that is all in your head\" I woke up like for real this time and I was terrified it was only 2:53am in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep it's like I was stopping myself from going to sleep.

        "text": "This happened when I was about 11, and I’ve always wondered what it might have been. I was out playing with all the other neighborhood kids on a summer night. It was dark out so maybe 8 or 9? We were all gathered on someone’s deck at one point and it outlooked some woods. They weren’t very big woods, just like a large barrier between different houses and streets. Someone pointed out this blinking light in the woods. And we ALL saw this (there were somewhere between 7-12 of us) so I know this definitely happened, it wasn’t just a trick on my eyes. There was a floating yellowish orb of light in the woods. It was quite far away from us and had to be smaller than a basketball but much bigger than a softball. It would “turn on” and glow for a couple seconds, then “turn off” and you wouldn’t see it. It had to be floating maybe 6-8 of ground. And it was moving, coming down a hill further into the woods (not towards us though). Every couple seconds the light would appear further down the hill. It moving at a walking pace. It definitely wasn’t a person with a lantern, it was too far off the ground, and the shape and size of the light was unlike any lantern I can even imagine. Also, the houses back in there were totally quite and what reason would anyone have to go down into the woods that late? It was also far to big to have been a firefly. Any ideas as to what this was?",

It didn’t move a muscle, it’s chest didn’t move so it didn’t appear to be breathing.\n\nIt was weird, I wasn’t afraid of whatever it was; it was oddly calming. It was anything freaky either. Just a silhouette of man ~6’ 2”.

It appeared to be a tall robbed figure. The robe was black, and no face visible inside the hood. It didn't say anything but it pointed at me, kind of thrusting its finger towards me. I distinctly remember it's pointer finger finger having some sort of brass or gold ring on it. A thick ring that was just a band. I'm pretty sure it was brass. At the time I just acted like I felt I should, so I made my nervousness visible. I tried blinking really hard and rubbing my eyes, but it didn't go away right away. Not that it was there long, maybe like 10 seconds? Anyway, that's my story.",

I would've believed i dreamed the whole thing, but i remember my grandpa checking around the house and talking to me about it. at that time i even thought that it was our neighbor that came to ask for something, so i wasnt really scared, I didn't think much of it. i could write it off as imagination of a scared child, but my fear of the dark never produced any hallucinations, visionary or auditory. i tend to think that it was my imagination after all, but it's a really weird expierence. nothing similar to this ever happened after that.",

Sometime in the middle of the night, I  was awoken by a tapping sound to the left of me, about 1 meter away. In a semi-awake state, I thought 'something is trying to get my attention'. Then I felt the mattress to the left of me depress to such an extent it felt like a 300 pound man was stepping on it. I told myself this is just another one of those someone is on the bed hallucinations. Suddenly though, the bed started shaking and then violently undulating beneath me for about a minute!  Seriously wtf. If it was just an hallucination, how could it feel like my body was undulating like I was at the epicentre of an earthquake? I told myself 'something is trying to scare me' so I kept calm, I didn't want it to win. Two more things, I've heard the same tapping on windows or metal downpipes when someone I know has passed away. Secondly, I notice that when I have these weird semi-conscious sleep episodes, my elbows feel a weird nervy feeling. I'm convinced this is related to all my weird semi-asleep episodes (there are others, such as outer body experiences0. Perhaps there is a nerve in the elbow that is related to a part of the brain that can manufacture its own psychedelic experiences ? Or is it a ghostly visitation, which I never used to believe in until I moved into my current house, but thats another story. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "November 13, 2011 is when my mom went crazy.\n\nMy parents were married for 21 years. My mom has always had her demons but for a long time she at least tried. Sometime in 2006 or 2007, after I went off to college, she went off her meds for depression for the 45992th time.\n\nThis time was different. I didn’t realize what mania looked like at the time (I was only 18), but years later I realized she had an adult onset of Bipolar Disorder. It was unnerving.\n\nIt was the last straw for my dad and he left. The divorce was finalized in 2008.\n\nMy mom was never the same. The combination of Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder (both diagnosed) meant watching her go up and down on a haunting roller coaster of destruction meant watching the small part of her that was a mother fade away.\n\nMy dad left her the house. The one we had lived in all my life. It’s a beautiful home, cozy and on the corner. There’s a big bay window and natural light. It always felt like home until the divorce.\n\nI hated being in the house after my dad left. Her behavior became more erratic and the lows became so much lower. And the house began to change.\n\nIt was dark and stale. And you couldn’t wait to leave. I’ve always chalked it up to my perception as a young adult weathering a divorce and my mom’s downward spiral. But now, I don’t know.\n\nIt got worse and worse over time and then I got the phone call on November 13, 2011. I was living in another city. The call was from my father, telling me a neighbor noticed he hadn’t seen my dog in the bay window for several days–and decided to use the spare key my mother had given him. The dog was found dead in the bathroom and my mother in bed, weak and frail.\n\nShe had laid in the bed for so long her leg muscles had atrophied. The dog, I’ve never been able to get answers on…but my sister once let it slip that there was blood.\n\nThe cleaners my aunt hired to clean the house found my cat three days into the job–crushed to death between the ottoman and chair in the back room.\n\nShe spent the next few years in a catatonic state, first in the mental hospital and then she was transferred to a nursing home.\n\nIn the meantime, I was the one to clean up the house. She was a shopaholic hoarder and mental illness had only amplified it.\n\nThe first time I came back home, it felt dark and stale—but it was empty. it didn’t have the panicked pressure that I had felt with my mother there. I sorted and cleaned. Sorted and cleaned. Sorted and cleaned.\n\nThe more I did this the lighter and brighter it became. Until it felt like home again. Not really, but kind of. There was always a little bit of staleness there. But I attributed (and perhaps still do) it to my subconscious awareness of what had happened there.\n\nOne thing I noticed about the house was that the lightness could become dark in the blink of an eye. And everything was gradual, if that makes sense. You never noticed things until you were consumed by the stale darkness. It was like a cloak coming over the place in one steady sweep. It was odd, but how can you explain it?\n\nI had a boyfriend. Our relationship wasn’t exactly healthy to begin with. But I will say that he noticed the same things I did with the house.\n\nThere were three specific incidents with that house.\n\n**First Incident**\n\nOne day, it was me, him, and one of his friends sitting in the middle room when we heard the distinct sound of the front door opening. They went to go check and it was closed, with no sign of being opened.\n\nThe thing about the door is that, as it was old like the rest of the house, the door had become difficult to open and close. In order to open it, you had to put your shoulder in to it. But in order to *close* it, you had to thrust your body weight against it several times before it would shut.\n\nWe heard it open, but we never heard it shut. This was impossible. Three people heard the exact same thing.\n\n**The second incident**\n\nMy ex and I were sitting in the middle room once again. We were in our office chairs at our desks talking about something when we distinctly heard several creaks overhead and a sudden SMASH–directly, and I mean directly–over my head in the attic.\n\nIt was as if someone took several steps until they were overhead and had either a plate or a glass bong (that very specific glass shattering sound) and threw it with great force. The sound was so incredibly clear.\n\nMy ex and I locked eyes with each other and he whispered “there’s someone in the attic”.\n\nI was gone. I bolted out to the garage and backed my car out and parked in the driveway. My ex came out to meet me and convinced me to stay where I was in the car as he called his best friend (the same one who heard the front door open/not open), and asked him to come with his gun so they could search the attic.\n\nHis best friend arrived in less than two minutes, with his weapon. They both went inside the house and searched the place from top to bottom as I sat in the driveway.\n\nThe way this home was set up was it was on a corner lot. The side gate faced the street and there was a bay window that wrapped around the house and stretched almost to the front door. We still had the blinds pulled up. This meant that from my vantage point I could see inside half of the house and if anyone exited through the only two exits in the home (the front door and side gate–i could even see the back fence from where I was–I would see them). I could even see the roof.\n\nIt was not a large home. I would be able to see if anyone was making an escape.\n\nAs I waited for the boys to return, I half expected to see a homeless man scramble out of the house. It was the only thing that could explain the sound of something being thrown right above my head. The boys completed the search of the home. Nothing and No one was to be found.\n\nI asked if they had checked the attic. ‘Thoroughly’ they said. I believe them. The thing about the attic of that house is that it wasn’t a true attic. The rafters were set up in such a way that a person could not walk around freely up there. If they did, they would fall through the ceiling. There was a light switch up there and the boys had examined every square inch of the attic, there was no sign of life to be found.\n\nNo glass. nothing.\n\nIt would be easy to write it off as a strange sound the old house had made if it wasn’t for one thing my boyfriend was insistent on: the footsteps he had heard leading up to the crash.\n\nHe was adamant. He had heard the footsteps above him as they walked to the spot right above me. He had heard the wood slightly creak as if something had lifted its arms up to throw something with force. I wear hearing aids, so I miss out on a lot of sounds.\n\nBut I had heard creaking before the smash. And I knew by then when my boyfriend was being sincere. I believe him even to this day as to hearing those footsteps.\n\n**The Third incident**\n\nWe were in the house for two or three years. I split my time between there and down south for college. My boyfriend stayed behind in the house. He would mention that there were times he just knew he wasn’t alone. But no other specific incidents took place.\n\nThe house began to get darker. Our fights grew worse and more violent. Something happened to my mind. It all happened gradually until it was horrible. A point of no return. To this day, the depression I felt there is like nothing I have ever experienced before. It changed me.\n\nAfter one particularly savage fight, I went for a drive and came back. I was alone, he was not there. I entered through the back door and was greeted by a wall of darkness. It was stale. Cold. Dark. Even though all the lights were on. You could barely breathe.\n\nI snapped. I yelled at the darkness in the kitchen, for no particular reason, ‘Get the fuck out. GO AWAY. I SEE YOU. GO. I'M SICK OF YOU”’\n\nIt retreated. I swear to you on my son, I visibly saw the darkness shift backwards. I screamed at it some more. And it retreated some more. There was light again. The house was light and beautiful again.\n\nMy memory stops there. In the kitchen screaming at the darkness. Then I wake up in my bed. Fully clothed, on top of the sheets. The house is dark again. The staleness is there again. But when I walk into the kitchen, it is light and bright.\n\nOddly enough, that was the first time I considered the possibility that there might be something more to the house. That there might be something otherworldly there. But what?\n\nNot too long after the incident in the kitchen, I left the house and it was put up for sale. I have been through many tough and trying times since then but I have never ever experienced the darkness, the sluggishness, the staleness, the pressure, the panic, the hopelessness, the bleakness, and the agony of that home since then.\n\nMy gut tells me that there’s something there. My rationalism is willing to concede that it could all be subconsciously rooted in the pain associated with the home’s history. But I feel that there truly is or was something dark and dangerous within the home.\n\nAnd I only wonder if it was there when my mother moved in with my father. Or if she created it with her downward spiral.\n\nI had a recurring dream while in that house. I would walk into the middle room and see something that resembled a cross between the creature from Alien and Predator. And it would lock eyes with me and I would hear in my mind “Widow Sullivan” and the dream would end. There is no one in my family with the name Sullivan. And I’m unsure if it’s connected, probably not. But I never had that dream again after leaving the home.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI've never been able to really explain what might be in there. It didn't seem to fit typical ghost tales. \n\nI'm not sure why I wonder if my mother \"created\" it. It's just something that's popped in my head every time I think about that house. I am open to any thoughts.\n\n**0 CommentsShareSave**",

        "text": "So, today is Sunday, a day I usually go out to hike a route I hiked many, many times. I don't anymore. But I had to think of it today, this experience is roughly 2.5 years old now and I haven't gone back to my old routine since then.    \n\n\nI live in a pretty small rural village in Germany. Less than 200 people live here, not much around here besides fields, forests, cows, sheep, a donkey and 2 horses. Directly outside of the house I live in, is a road to the right which leads into a field and then into a pretty thick forest. The route I usually take is around 18 km long or 11 miles for the US readers (I will simply stick to miles, to keep it simple). It doesn't sound like much, but the route is very rough, It's uphill almost the entire time and the forest has no \"roads\" so you actually walk through rough terrain with thick tree roots and bushes etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I walk this exact route 1-2 times per week and usually when It's already dark outside, I wear a headlamp for when It's too cloudy out and the moon isn't nicely visible, so I don't trip or get hurt. Why at evening/night? Because I'm usually on the phone with a good friend talking, we live very far apart, It's day for her when It's night for me. I don't mind, because that way, I don't feel alone hiking. \n\nInfo dump, because I deem it important:\n\n For people who are not familiar with German forests, the most dangerous thing you may encounter is a wild boar, so It's usually pretty safe to just wander around. Almost no wolves where I am and even if, they would be way too \"shy\" to just show themselves. Bears are not a thing here, also no crazy people living inside the forest, the only thing you encounter is the farmer who drives up like 1-2 miles into the road to check on his livestock, after that It's all forests, no fields anymore anyway. \n\nNow to the weird thing I experienced:   \n\n\nHeadlamp on, airpods in, talking to my friend, catching up. For the first 5 miles or so, nothing weird happened, I even had the headlamp off, though I wore it on my head, the moon was making enough light and once your eyes adjust to the dark, you can see quite well, as long as you don't sprint around the forest. Though once I was in the deeper part of the forest, my airpods started making weird sounds, almost like I was losing connection, but I could hear her voice still, it was more like a background buzzing, it wasn't actually interfering with my call. This buzzing went on and after 20 minutes or so, I suddenly noticed that I couldn't see as well anymore as I could. \n\nThe moon was blocked by clouds, but these clouds didn't look like normal clouds. They looked like thick walls of fog just way higher up than fog should be - I know It's hard to picture but...clouds usually look fluffy or thinned out, these seemed heavy and...wet? It's hard to describe. I told my friend to hold on for a minute, because I had to focus on something (Idk why I said that, but focusing on her talk was disrupting my \"view\" for whatever reason lol, sensory overload I guess). \n\nThe thing I had to focus on was a huge, thick, deep black cloud. It kinda pushed itself through the fog like clouds and positioned itself right over me, almost as if it was trying to throw a shadow around an area I was in. The cloud also started to \"swirl\" in the middle slightly and that was when my connection just fell flat. I got the beeping sounds you get when you lose connection and gone was my phone call. No more bars, no mobile data. Nothing. BUT my airpods were still buzzing like crazy in my ears.\n\nThat's when I felt uneasy, neck hair standing up, cold sweats on my back and I started turning around to leave, because the way ahead just seemed a lot more dark and sinister than my way back. The moment I turned around and started...well slightly jogging back because I felt scared, was when I started to hear....bell sounds? Almost like church bells, but the sound was deeper, that typical \"ring\" you hear after a bell sound was just stuck in the air and it was giving me this weird sensation as if my bones were suddenly rubbing against each other. It was extremely freaky, all I remember is that I started to go from walking back to jogging back to running back trying to leave the forest and go back to the fields where you start. I didn't look back while running, but I could hear the bell sound getting weaker the further away I got and the fog like clouds were becoming less and less until I finally left the forest and I was back to a normal sky, thin clouds and the moon. \n\nOnce I got back home, I simply undressed, went into the shower and went to bed. Thinking I just simply got spooked today or maybe I was exhausted and my brain went haywire. I don't know. But I never saw a cloud like that in my life and church bells are not a thing late at night inside a forest. \n\nNever went back to hike that route. Never told anyone, because I'm a bit embarrassed. But I had to think of it today.",

        "text": "I never really brought this up to many people. I've only ever told some of my friends and my cousin. When I was 5 experienced constant nightmares and strange activities after the deaths of my baby sister and grandpa. My parents had my baby sister who sadly passed away 3 days after birth due to birth malfunctions. I only have three memories of that time. Me playing in the child area with my grandma, me recieving some dinosaur books to keep me company, and seeing her for the last time before she was taken off life support. I have no other memories of her. Shortly after she died my grandpa died as well. I actually spent quite some time with him but oddly enough don't have that many memories of him. \n\nShortly after both of their deaths I started to have constant nightmares and what seemed to be sleep paralysis. I would wake up frozen in my bed. Voices would go off in my head and my bed would start rapidly spinning. The most vivid memory of this would be this strong pain I would feel in my back that seemed like someone was stabbing me. These dreams would progressively get worse and the pain I'd feel in my back would become more painful. The voices I'd hear became louder and eventually I'd start to see figures in my room. \n\nStrangely enough I only had one paranormal experience while living in the apartment I was having these dreams in. It was the middle of the night and my mom was in the kitchen cooking. The way the apartment was laid out had the kitchen next to a long hallway where the bedrooms were located. I was sitting at the end of the hallway which was right next to where my mom would have been cooking. I was playing with my stuffed dinosaurs and decided to throw one at the end of the hallway. A strange feeling overcame me and I could do nothing but sit there in silence and stare at the toy I threw. I can vividly remember the toy sit up and start moving toward me. I wasn't scared but knew something wasn't right either. I tried to call out to my mom but couldn't yell as it felt like I was out of breath. As the toy neared me it fell over and I could feel myself escape the trance I was in. At that point I felt nothing. I was still not scared and didn't tell my mom about what had happened. This was the only paranormal thing that happened to me at this apartment other than my reoccurring lifelike nightmares. \n\nAbout a year into this happening to me we moved to a duplex further into the city we lived on. There was a small break of the nightmares I had but they reappeared shortly after. Unlike the ones I had at the previous apartment these were much more violent and lifelike. The nightmares would usually consist of an order like this\n•I'd wake up frozen hearing voices and sweating\n•I would move my eyes around until I noticed a black figure standing in my room\n•there would be silence until my blanket would be slowly pulled off of me\n•a feeling of nausea and dizziness would hit me and then I could finally sit up and it would stop\n\nThis went on for a year with the same pattern. The worst one I had has always stuck with me. Again the pattern repeated again but it didn't stop once I sat up. This time when I did sit up the voices I heard almost sounding like yelling in my head. I became very hot and extremely dizzy and nauseous. While I was on the same floor as my parents I did not feel an urge to wake them but rather run downstairs to the bathroom where I sat over the toilet as if I was going to vomit. My vision felt static somewhat and the stabbing feeling in my back was extremely painful. I ended the night falling asleep on the couch. The nightmares didn't stop until we eventually moved out again to a house in the woods we rented for a couple of years. I was in the 5th grade by then and surprisingly never experienced any activities like that again in my life. I would have nightmares every now and then but they were never as scary as the ones I had previously. Has anyone else had this feeling as well? I remember it all so vividly but can never understand why it happened or why it stopped so abruptly.",

Of course I reacted like a sane person and yelled and jumped back, my brother asked me what was wrong and I tried to tell him that I had saw a face but he didn't believe me. After that nothing really happened besides whenever I close my eyes I see a person burning, I can vividly see them grabbing at their face, it isn't lifelike though it looks like a drawing; It's been happening every time I close my eyes to sleep.  \n\n\nThursday of this week I was trying to sleep, I was restless so I rolled over to see if there was anything going on in my room and I looked to my door (keep in mind my lights are off) and see a tall jet black figure who can barely fit in my doorway (average doorway.) the thing was very skinny it looked like he was studying me like I was a creature to be watched in a petting zoo. The creature looked like it was moving it's head around but I couldn't see it well because it didn't have any facial features and my room was dark; whenever I saw it I locked eyes with it for ten-fifteen seconds and I rubbed my eyes to make sure it wasn't seeing things the creature started to laugh, it's arms grabbed at it's sides as if I was the funniest joke it's ever seen. I turn over and turn back to it and it was still there, it didn't leave. I yelled at my brother to turn on the lights, but of course I took my eyes off of the thing to look at my brother but as soon as I turned back to the monster it had left. I tried to play it off cool and acted like I wanted to go into the closet and change into more comfortable clothes. I did and then went back to try and sleep, I never looked at the door again that night.",

        "text": "I have two stories to share relating to the \"many worlds\" theory, and would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nFirst story: I was interested in parkour at a young age, this was during the prime time of parkour yt video’s. I of course replicated or tried to do such by climbing anything in view. One day I decided to climb a tree at the local park, it was a fairly tall tree and easily traversable. Upon climbing the tree I came to a height of about 15 feet, to my left a branch extended above a chain link fence. I thought it would be cool to shift myself towards the end of the branch, as I did the branch broke effectively sending me to the ground, as I landed everything went black for a moment, I opened my eyes only to be greeted with a mangled arm. Firstly My head should have hit the fence killing me, yet there was no indication of any impact to the head. I should have felt the force from hitting the ground but yet I didn’t, yes my arm was broken but it was as if my physical being shifted mid fall 6 feet from the fence when realistically I should have looked like a cracked egg. \n \nSecond story: I liked to be fix it Felix as I imagine most kids liked to aspire to be, I thought I could fix anything for some reason. So of course I sought out broken objects in the hopes of I being able to repair them, A radio that had exposed wires was a perfect opportunity to please my little mind. Two copper wires protruded from the plug in cable, of course little me thought it was only I whom could fix such a broken radio. My thought process had me determine the way I could fix said radio was power! So I took the two wires and plunged them into the electrical socket… well little me a realization like no other when I was tossed back in slow motion I kid you not… I was thrown about 10 feet backwards in slow motion… yes I managed to slow time down for a mere 30 seconds, as this happened I looked around taking everything in with absolute awe. After the sequence I was immediately dialed back into normal motion, htting the floor. \n\nWhat do you make of the second story? Any scientific answers? I’m very interested into hearing what you all have to say",

        "text": "I work third shift, and I worked a half night a few days ago, which meant I was driving home around 3:30/4:00 in the morning. I’ve been driving the same route for years and know the area well, and because I do a lot of night driving, I’m very familiar with how the area looks in the dark (especially since it’s a fairly rural drive and we have a large deer population, so I try to be very aware of my surroundings at night). I say all this as a preface to drive home the fact that I fully, truly know that whatever I saw was at least out of the ordinary if not paranormal, because 90% of my driving is done under these circumstances so I’m not inclined think it was just my eyes or mind playing tricks on me.\n\nSo I was turning at a four way stop to head into town. There are a couple homes and businesses at the intersection, but it’s mostly fields, so as I’m turning, I instinctively scan once I’m through the intersection for deer, since it’s not uncommon for them to be crossing the road in that area. So I’m glancing to the left, and I see something. There aren’t cars around, so I slow down a bit and get a better look (again, fully expecting a deer). What I saw was a very tall, unnaturally thin, all white, humanoid figure. It had to have been 8 feet tall, and its arms were longer than a human’s (its wrists were a little past its knees); it was walking from the field toward the road/my car, and while it was kind of lumbering, it was moving quick/covering a lot of ground due to its size. It was a little hunched in its posture, but was walking in a very deliberate way. It was in the field probably 20 feet from the road when I first saw it.\n\nI immediately was hit with this absolute wave of terror like I’ve never felt. Not just “I’m seeing something weird in the middle of the night” scared, but “This thing can, will, and wants to kill me” scared. I immediately hit the gas (by this point it was nearing the shoulder of the road), and when I checked my mirrors, it was gone. Full disclosure, I do have anxiety disorder and panic disorder, so I am susceptible to sudden onset panic attacks. But this was a completely different type of fear. It felt targeted almost, like it was explicitly causing me to feel fear, maybe it hopes that I would experience fight, flight, or freeze and go with freeze. But if it was that powerful, why would it need to toy with me?\n\nI have no clue what it was, Google hasn’t been helpful, and I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone IRL. Anyone have any advice or similar experiences?",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nThere recently was a thread about 'What made you believe in ghosts'.  I will start with the same context many probably have said before but I was an extremely skeptical individual.  I believe that the majority of events that occur can be explained by logical explanations.  That was until both myself and wife had our experiences with several unexplainable events.  I want to context that these events have changed both my wife and myself views on many things, including paranormal.  Events took place around 6 years ago.  \n\n\nWife and I were staying at my fathers house after he passed away. Everyone in the family spoke about the house being haunted as long as I can remember. Personally, never had anything weird happen prior to this and overall just chalked it up to that side of the family being over zealous/story tellers. We were at the house for around a week to help clean it out as it was around 6h away from where we lived. There were several weird events leading to the 'final' event that changed myself and wife forever. To give better context, the house itself was a postage stamp style Victorian house with 2 floors and a semi finished 'apartment style' attic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst event - I was going up into the attic to work on cleaning out some stuff my father had up there. He was an avid collector of NASCAR diecast and other collectibles and things were everywhere. On my way up the steps, I was on the phone with my wife who had went to get food, when I saw the handle on the attic door twist and the door slightly open. This area we were in was not necessarily dangerous but was far from nice. I instantly thought someone had broken in and immediately ran up to investigate. I searched everywhere and could not find anyone. \\*(In retrospect, it was idiotic to go up there alone as if someone WAS up there, I was not prepared to handle it. Grief makes emotions just dull, including fear).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond Event - Wife, myself and a childhood friend were in the same attic cleaning out items. In the attic, there was thick old shag carpet that had been there from the 70s. Since it was a semi finished attic, one room was for storage and is where my buddy was working. I look at my wife who is literally just points at the door. We both watch the door for that room close slowly on my buddy. There was zero reasoning or explanation, as we both saw it and the door itself took a large amount of force to actually close. Obviously my buddy was pretty unhappy and we both just said 'sorry, forgot you were in there' to avoid him thinking both of us were losing our minds or scare him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast Event - The last night we ever stayed there, we slept on the second floor in the master bed room. The bedroom itself was positioned so the headrest of the bed's wall was aligned with a set of stairs coming up. The wall and stairs were about 3-15 feet difference in height, depending on the location, an important piece to what ended up happening. Throughout the night, my wife kept waking me up to say someone was walking around on the platform landing outside. I look and did see what looked like a shadow under the door frame, so I immediately opened the door and braced for what I assumed was an intruder. Again nothing was there even after searching the house extensively. Later that night, I am awoken to sounds of scratching in the wall behind my head. My wife is awake already and looking at me oddly/terrified as she hears it too. I assume it is a rat or some type of animal, while weird it was directly behind me, would not be a far fetched possibility as the house did have critters in it. In a tired rage, I turn around and just punch the wall to scare it off. Within a second, something punches back on the wall with such force it shakes the entire thing. We both then hear foot steps stomping/running away from us and up the attic stairs. At this moment we are both at a loss for words and immediately pack up with our son and leave. We call the police and just assume it HAS to be someone who broke in until the next day when we started to think about it. The area where the scratching was occurring was above the steps, a good 10 feet and even an extremely tall man would have had trouble reaching with a ladder. However, even if they could reach, what we couldn't explain is how this thing 'ran on a floor' that literally did not exist. The sound of running was not going up steps but as if there was a hallway/floor directly behind the wall, which there was not. The police found no signs of a break in or of any intruder being there. The security cameras (ring) outside never had any alerts or saw anyone coming in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe ended up selling the house as is with everything in it and never stayed over there again. I came down briefly a few weeks later to finish up some final business and just went to tell my father 'goodbye' at the house. Upon entering, the house just felt so hateful? I don't understand how a house could have feelings but if someone was to ask me what I felt, hateful is the word I would use. I have no idea to this date what any of it ways. To clarify, had I not been in such a state of grief I would have never investigated nor stayed after the first event. My dad always brushed off the other family members claims to it being haunted as 'no big deal' and even in my childhood years visiting I never once had an odd experience. My dad and I had a good relationship throughout his life and he never talked about the house in a negative light. The house was built in 1879 by a French family and after them, my family owned it from 1952 and on. Nothing traumatic ever happened there, nor any weird family events. It was just a plain old boring house prior to that week.\n\nHow has everyone else coped with a truly unexplainable event?  My wife and I still to this day can not even talk about it without getting chills or feeling literally insane.",

        "text": "I live in a town that was settled in the late 1630s. The house where this event occurred was not particularly old. I did, however, live in a home built in 1714 when I was a small child. Nothing strange happened there that I remember -- I did eat lead paint there, though. \n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I'm 95% sure this took place. I say that with a small chance of uncertainty only because I recalled this experience about 10 years after it happened. I try to be extremely logical, try to believe only \"true things\", and with that in mind, I still believe this experience to be real. I think I must've accepted it at the time, which led me to forget about it. But ever since, I've had crippling home invasion anxiety. \n\nBasically, one night, when I was around 10-11, I got out of my bed and stood in my doorway. Typically I would only leave my bed if I needed to pee, and in those instances, I would prepare myself to run down the hall to my bathroom or my parents bathroom prior to getting up. So, to stand still in the doorway was already a strange thing for me to have done. I'm unsure if there was some feeling that got me to stand still by my door, but regardless, I waited there for a minute. Then, something -- I closed my eyes at this point -- rushed down from the third floor, crunched up by my right ear, and, in a loud, aggressive whisper, said, POW POW POW. \n\nI do recall thinking that maybe it was like Powwow, that I, in my old colonial town, was haunted (rightfully) by an indigenous American man. But, when I retold the story to my mother a few years ago, she suggested that perhaps it was a young ghost boy pretending to play guns with me. Of course, it was not a little boy's voice, and the tone was not playful. But I think my mother way right, it was a human's voice making the sound of a gun. \n\nEventually, I went to boarding school, and my room was moved to the third floor, where the POW POW POW came down from. I've always gotten weird vibes and occasionally heard a knocking sound -- my father says it's a woodpecker -- but I try and tell myself that it's just my anxiety. \n\nThere's been some spooky sh*t on my mom's side of the family, which I could go into if people are curious. But anyways, I haven't been unable to find any experiences that are similar to mine and was wondering what you all might think. Home invasion anxiety is tough. I often think that I will certainly die some nights and am shocked to wake up alive. At this point, my brain tells me that this experience was some sort of prophecy and that I will be shot in the head one day. Again, I try and tell myself this is likely my anxiety. \n\nLet me know if you have any similar tales or input.",

Not like winning on lottery. But stuff that actually matters.\n\nAnd now I recently got dumped by the girls of my dreams. And I got this super weird almost supernatural feeling again telling me it will be us but not right now. ( I’m not going to wait for her just want to make that clear)\n\nMy family have been shaking there heads smiling  when this kinds of stuff happens to men. And telling me that I am extremely lucky. But idk is it luck? Because it is almost like I know it beforehand?\n\nI’m not religious at all but I heard someone told me that I have an guardian angel. \n\nIs this just me being stupid?

        "text": "I’ve heard a lot of mixed things. I’ve heard that setting certain intentions and going out and playing around with this kind of stuff can lead to bad things, specifically bad entities, and general shit like that. I’m not sure how much I believe in a lot of the stories about Randonautica; I think a lot of it comes down to confirmation bias. And the fact that so many people use it, it’s bound to have something weird happen (plus, we only hear about the creepy stuff, that’s what floats to the top. People who have had normal experiences probably far outnumber the creepy stuff but we don’t hear about it because it doesn’t drive clicks.) But the simple fact is there are some experiences I’ve heard about that make the potential for weird shit to happen far more believable. \n\nAnd the one time that I did engage in Randonautica, I encountered something very strange with my camera malfunctioning in a way that I’ve never seen it malfunction, in a way that I have been unable to replicate, and in a way that I haven’t seen anyone else report with my specific model of camera. My very first paranormal experience actually involved something fucking with my camera in a very strange way and so this kind of brought back flashbacks.\n\nI myself have had three paranormal experiences in my life that have shaken me to the core. I am a former skeptic, now more of what I call a “half skeptic”. Someone who believes that people are genuine with their experiences but takes everything with a grain of salt. Through these experiences I have recognized that entities and other paranormal phenomena may or may not attract themselves to a person due to their intention.\n\nSo my question for everyone here is, is there a general consensus on Randonautica? Is it just confirmation bias and weird random things happening simply because the amount of people using the app is naturally going to have reports of strange and scary shit happening? Or should we just not fuck with this sort of stuff?",

I had dozens of experiences in that house but am telling the ones that are significant.\n\nAfter learning that the previous committed suicide in the dining room. I asked questions. I asked her name and why she committed suicide. We'll call her Ronda and apparently her husband left her for another woman,in the 90s. Another neighbor claims he left her after she miscarried. Don't know if that was true or not, according to the first neighbor I asked, that wasn't true.\n\nAfter learning this, I was extremely wary in that house. I would actually wait for my siblings to get home before entering. I just wouldn't feel safe or comfortable being there alone. \n\nI eventually got the courage to go in and tried my best to watch TV without thinking about the entity in there. I was doing good until I started hearing foot steps. They sounded like someone walking with high heels on. I knew what these sounded like because my mom wore them when we went to church.\n\nI turn the TV down and it sounds like it's walking from one room to another. Everything goes quiet and i can hear two people talking. It was very faint but it was 2 different people. A man and a woman. The woman sounded like she was in distress, almost like she crying. \n\nThen I hear footsteps but they sound almost like the person is stomping. I nope out of there and wait outside. I had to wait probably 45 mins until someone arrived. Even outside I felt like someone was watching me. \n\nI looked around at the windows and saw a pair of eyes. This caught my attention and I looked harder. What I saw I will never forget. \n\nI saw a face but this face had a purple face, yellow eyes and was wearing some sort of thing on their head. The thing was it was smiling and looking back at me. When I saw this I almost felt backwards. When I looked again, it was gone. \n\nWhen my sister got home, I told her what I saw. She asked \"you saw it too ?\". I asked what she meant. She said she saw it poking it's head in through her room door when she was barely waking but thought she was dreaming. \n\nI had many experiences in that house but that is probably the most significant and only time I saw this thing.",

And yet I still feel uncomfortable.\nIt was built by my grandfather in the 1990s, so I wasn't even born. \nIt used to be a Cyber Cafe, but when we (my twin and I) were 2, my parents had to move out and so my grandpa decided to renovate a part of it (the two upstairs floors) into a house for us to live.\n\n It is pretty big, like I said there are two floor, the first one is where most of the rooms are, and the second is smaller so we use it as an attic. When we were younger, my twin sister and I weren't allowed to go upstairs because the stairs weren't safe. But late at night I used to hear footsteps, like clear footsteps of someone walking around in the attic and it used to scare me to dead. Of course I didn't believe in ghosts so I'd always check if anyone was awake but of course they were all asleep. \n\nAlso, when a cousin or a relative come to sleepover, they always say that they saw the same tall bloody figure of a man waving at them in the doorway of the kitchen, which I saw too, it's really strange because it's scary but intriguing at the same time. \n\nWhen I was about 9-10 years old, I used to have lots of night terrors, and till know I'm scared to sleep because of it. Like, I used to have nightmares and heard noises all around the house. Sometimes I cried my eyes out when we had to return home and was begging my parents to sleepover at my grandma's or something like that because I really just didn't wanna sleep at mine. But the most strange part is, I forgot everything. I still remember being traumatized by what I saw in my nightmare or in the house but I can't remember any detail, like if it was deleted from my memories. I know sometimes when someone is living a really difficult \"part of their life\" the brain just erase it for the mental sake of the person (traumatic amnesia I think) yet I still find it bizarre.\n\nI also remember that I was so fcking scared to sleep in my room and would always go to my parents room, idk why tho. \n\nTill this day I don't if the house in haunted or someting, so please tell me if you think it is, and there are still a lot of things that happened (when my grandpa died last year for exemple), but I'm bit tired and it's not so easy to talk about.",

        "text": "\n(Reposting this because NoSleep kept taking it down and giving me all kinds of rules of how my “story” should be written. This isn’t some silly story, I’m asking for advice)\n\nSo i know this thread is full of made up scary stories and such. I know there are probably also posts much like my own here now, true or not. I’m only posting this here because this is a very active thread and I’m looking for opinions. I’m also not sure what to tag this with, I’m not very active on Reddit. \n\nMy toddler (2yo) sleeps in his own room on the other side of the house in his crib. On two occasions now we have heard him talking to someone through the baby monitor we keep in his room. The first time was back around August. \n\nWe heard him talking and figured it was just him talking to himself as toddlers do. We paid it no attention and were falling asleep until we heard a clear and distinct “Hey!” The voice sounded like a grown man but youthful and cheery. Me and my gf both heard it and sat up at the same time. I grabbed my pistol and immediately headed to his room to inspect. No one was there. I checked the surrounding rooms to find the same. My toddler was wide awake and seemed fine and happy. \n\nWe were trying to come up with a solution to what we heard. We thought maybe it was one of his toys, yet none are in his reach or motion activated. Lord knows he has plenty of those that talk. None of them have a voice line that just says “Hey” though, not with that voice we heard or without playing music and/or talking more than just that. We searched the web as people do and thought maybe the monitor was picking up a radio signal from a nearby station or possibly an emergency police or fire scanner. That still could be a possibility but it seemed too clear and just the one word with nothing else and not even a touch of static or interference. Who knows, we forgot mostly about it in the following weeks.\n\nTonight, just less than an hour ago, my girlfriend and I were laying down for bed. I got up to use the bathroom moments later when our toddler started calling for “Dada” over the monitor. I mostly just smiled and continued to the bathroom until he said “Can you hear me?” in a kind of confused, questioning tone. The kind he uses when he’s repeating something you’ve said to him for the first time. That made me pause. He’s never said those words or even heard that phrase to my knowledge. \n\nMy girlfriend turned up the volume on the monitor confused too. I was standing at the bathroom door and she was laying on the bed holding the baby monitor to her ear and began saying she could hear whispering, whispering while our toddler was still calling loudly for “Dada.” Again, i grabbed my pistol and inspected, gf following close behind. Again same story, no one in his room or anywhere else in the house. He seemed fine and happy standing in his crib. We asked him who he was talking to several times with no real answer other than him giggling and saying “Hey Mama, Hey Dada.” \n\nI went to the bathroom as i was going to before. While in there I heard our toddler say “Tony” to my gf. She said he had put his finger to his lips like he was telling her to shush when he said it. He’s never done that before. Tony was his great uncle who died years before his birth and before me and my gf got together. His house used to be right beside where our current one is. I say our house but we live in a trailer which is only 2 years old and was moved here 2 years ago. \n\nWe don’t talk about Tony, i wouldn’t have much to say being as how i’ve never met him. He passed away in the hospital, but I’ve heard the stories of spirits sticking to the land or house they lived in. Also the stories of children seeing people who have passed away.\nHas anyone else experienced this sort of thing with their children and is it something i should be concerned about?",

        "text": "I made an account just to get my story out, I have contacted police to have a report about it.\n\nJust recently I got back and don't know what to say about my experience. I called the police to make a report and tried to come here to see if anyone had any similar experiences with what happened to me.\n\nNov 18th-21st\nI arrived at a public access parking lot and got my roughly 35ish pounds of gear on me, locked up my vehicle and started my camping and hiking trip. The first day and night was very normal, though I did tie my food on a rope and pulled it up on a higher branch about 15ish feet off the ground.. it's pretty normal so bears are less likely to mess with your stuff. On the second day(19th), I woke up early and started to walk and came upon a very strange scene.. there were four people who had white robes on, but no hood, I noticed they were watching me as I slowly peaked around a corner with my walk. As I walked past them, I smelled something strange, it smelled foul and when i noticed their eyes, it was as if their eyes were pure black orbs. I tried not to pay too much attention to it, but I also noticed that the skin of their faces were off colored from their neck and hands. I walked by then and heard a weird clicking noise , so I turned around and looked at them, but it seemed like they all shifted and were staring at me head on without saying anything. I was super creeped out so I started jogging until I didn't see them and I went off the trail a good bit away to set up my camp. That night was.. awful to say the least, I got woken up by rustling near my tent, so I sit there and wait, listening more and it sounded like whispers and weird noises I couldn't make out because I was so tired. I sat up all throughout the night even when it seemed like whatever made the noise was gone. I'm just glad I had my glock on me to reassure myself that I'm not defenseless. Very early the next day(20th) I peek out or my tent through a sliver and I dont see anything, so I end up opening it up slowly and looking around, and I see around my tent theres weirdly shaped footprints, they went around the tent area, and I was scared, so i quickly packed up my gear and started hiking back down the trail and I noticed one of the people in white further up the trail I was going to go if I wasn't just about to dip out and go to my car, and they were walking at a casual pace in my direction, so I started jogging with my gear and then I noticed another one of the white robed people further back on the trail I was backtracking to get to my car. As soon as i see them, I break for a sprint, dropping hundreds of dollars of gear to try and dissuade them incase they're trying to rob me. And after I became gassed out, I see a small crevice under a tree, so I wedge myself into it and scoop dirt with my hands up into the entrance until only a sliver of light peeked into my little spot. I waited there for a while until I started hearing footsteps past me, and a clicking, and weirdly hoarse, and very guttural sounds from multiple figures.. I could really only see part of their white robes as they passed where I was. I stayed until the next morning.. approximately 14 hours from my guesstimate. After I peaked around from the dirt opening and hadn't heard or seen anything, l slowly pushed dirt from the opening and immediately got up, even though my legs were screaming at me, I stumbled up and walked to the trail, making sure to not make any noise other than what was noise I couldn't hide. As soon as I made it to the trail, I ran as fast and as hard as I could and saw the first break as I got to my parking spot, rattled the keys out of my pocket and unlocked my door, immediately grabbed the phone out of my car after I turned it on and started speeding away as I called 911. At the station after a lot of questioning, I didn't have a satisfactory answer from the police about what they would do - they treated me as if I hallucinated entirely of the events, even asking if I had done any drugs, which I never have done any illicit, nor am on a prescription. So I went out to my car and noticed in the dust on my drivers side back window, there was scrawled \"it would have been fun to find you :(\"\n\nI was really worried about it and became increasingly paranoid, so I took my care a mechanic and told them someone may have put a tracker on my car and asked I'd they could try and find one.\n\nI used a rental car for the time being while they looked in and around my car for days, and said there were no tracking devices.\n\nI'm sure that I cant be the only one to have experienced something incredibly off and scary in the Shasta area, and if anyone has had any similar experiences, please let me know. I'm not sure whether I had a \"paranormal\" experience or not, but it was terrifying and I still have nightmares about when I was in the crevice and in them, the figures actually find me.\n\nIf anyone has ANYTHING substantial to add, I really would appreciate it a lot to try and figure out what happened.. I've been just rattled since then.\n\nThank you for reading and listening to my story, I just hope that more people see this and understand that if you see the people with white robes in the area, turn around and go back. Avoid them at all costs. I can only imagine what would have happened if I was caught.",

        "text": " \n\nThe summer holidays at grandma's place were traumatizing more than it is scary. The second night with my sister came with a bunch of creepy instances. Now, guys, it took a total of two weeks for us to adjust to the house's 'hauntedness'. How my grandmother lives in that house alone is beyond me but somehow I now understand her affliction towards it.\n\nAny sane person would move out of the place or at least that room after a harrowing experience like that the previous night. Moving out of the house was out of the question because we weren't allowed to leave, we didn't have any money on us and my aunts live a good distance from my grandma's place. Plus this house is in a very rural country-side area. \n\nAnd so the discussion with my sister that followed the next day forced me to retreat into my room. As I mentioned in part 1, my grandma had a very creepy habit of roaming around the house at night. According to my sister, the previous night when the clock chimed twice, my grandma got up with a blanket over her head. My sister is a very light sleeper. She woke as soon as my grandma forced herself off the bed. My sister called to my Ammamma (grandma in my language) but she didn't heed, instead, she slowly walked out of the bedroom into the living room, walked around the house, and sat in an armchair in the living room. The armchair was placed exactly opposite the bedroom where my sister was sleeping. She watched as my grandma unblinkingly stared out the living room window and fell asleep somewhere during the night. In the morning, when we confronted Ammamma, she said she likes to sit in her armchair when she can't sleep at night. My sister's recollections of that night put me on edge.\n\nThe thing is guys, at this point, even the smallest abnormal thing could have alarmed us. We were very much tuned into everything around the place, tiny bumps and kicks scared us. My sister and I weren't particularly courageous. I simply didn't care about the paranormal before, so I did not pay attention to it until that night. My sister, as I said, was a very guarded person. She hates the dark and wouldn't take the effort to investigate a random sound because according to her, that's what gets you killed in horror movies. And I agreed. \n\nAs to why we continued to sleep in the most haunted room of the house? I can only assume it's because of poor judgment and a lack of options. If you had the choice between a creepy person and a haunted room, which would you take?\n\nWe tried talking to my parents. My dad, who is a very spiritual guy, explained to both of us that nothing unearthly can hurt us. He explained how certain houses can attract certain types of energy and that the only way to fight it is simply through a state of mind. And honestly, at that point, I didn't understand jack-shit about what he said. But the baseline was that they refused to pick us up. Apparently, it was important for my dad for us to be brave because in his words 'Once you run, you always end up running.'\n\nSo my sister and I decided it was time to buck up. After the talk with my dad, my sister and I came to the conclusion that we should see what my grandma does at night and I also wanted to see the whole thing in person. That night, we kept our door unlocked, when the needle hit 2, two chimes echoed through the walls, and minutes later we heard shuffling from the living room. We quietly waited, trying to hold on to the bit of courage that our dad imparted. I tiptoed out of the room with my sister right behind me. My grandma was sitting in her armchair looking outside the window. The light outside illuminated her face, her eyes were clearly open.\n\n'Ammamma?'\n\nI called out to her quietly but she seemed oblivious to our existence. The whole thing looked eery. At this point, I was like, 'fuck it! imma see what's going on.' (kids, for future reference, that's how people get killed) I cautiously walked towards her, placed my hand on her shoulders, and shook her lightly.\n\n'Ammammaa?'\n\nAs soon as I called her, her head drooped down forward, like she fell asleep. My sister reached for her blanket and called her a bit more loudly. At this point, guys, something changed. It was like an icy-hot stone fell into my stomach, I knew something was wrong. My grandma's head which was drooped down to her neck slowly moved sideways like someone was pulling it to the side. She looked right at us but there was nothing in her eyes. The light illuminating half her face reflected dead eyes and her lips were half open, white and dry. And a tiny struggle of a voice came from her throat but seemed like it got caught in mid-way. The next thing I know, my sister and I are locking ourselves in our room. We stayed inside until dawn. In the morning, when we confronted my grandma, she looked clueless. She didn't even see us last night. Scared was an understatement to what my sister and I were feeling.\n\n  \nThat was the last night of hands-on investigation. We never got out of our room at night after that incident. And I know most of you are going to say that she must have been sleepwalking or maybe it's sun-down syndrome. I looked at everything for a rational explanation after I came back home. And maybe it is sun-down syndrome, but the feeling really got to me. As soon as my sister called her, I knew something was wrong. I hated the unnaturalness of it. Being scared is one thing but that feeling like you are intruding into something private is a totally different thing.\n\nWe didn't mention any of this to my parents. But what we did was find out about the history of the house and it isn't particularly clean.  I can do a part 3 explaining the history of the house and our final conclusion of the house, if you guys are interested. Let me know what you think!",

I've never really had any paranormal experiences until 2 weeks ago when me and my partner went to a public paranormal investigation evening which was filled with communication from spirits.\n\nLast night I slept from 10pm - 2am and then was awake until 4:30am waiting for my partner to come home before returning to bed. I had hallucinations once falling asleep that I cant even tell you really if they weren't real. It could have well been real life I was exactly where I was in my room nothing was different like it might be if it was a dream/nightmare. I could feel/see/hear everything as normal. \n\nSomething grabbed my leg and was pulling it up and out of bed and I was resisting. Also what I originally thought was my boyfriend cuddling me, then quickly morphed into a demon like being and went inside me.\n\nThis has NEVER happened to me. I've not had sleep paralysis, hallucinations or paranormal things happen. So this is really strange for me and I'd like to share my experience and hear about other people's and whether they put this down to the paranormal or just tiredness, mental health etc? (I don't suffer with mental health issues myself)",

        "text": "Hi all. I'm not a believer, but i know for a fact these unseen things exist personally by proof and experiences. (read my story here called \"started hearing voices after doing EVP\")  \n\n\nMy question is, do they have vocal cords? Supposedly not, because they don't have a physical body for that, so we can just say it's telepathically, but even if that's so (which i know it is but unsure if there is  another way they do it also) how do we explain that they have unique voices?   \n\n\nI mean, just like human we sound different, because of our vocal cords these things do as well they sound different. Now that i think of it, i know they can shape-shift into what ever they want and even change the voice to sound exactly as your mother to deceive you, i guess i answered my own question. lol  \n\n\nThey can mimic the voices as well as they mimic the looks and manners of your mother, so it's not that they change their vocal cords, but they just mimic it by their ability to shape-shift.  So either they physically change their whatever material they are made of body that gives them a particular voice or it's all telepathically done, anyone they choose for to listen in, they can tune in so only them they want to hear them and the others close to you won't hear it, that's an ability they also have.",

I just noticed it was deleted, so I thought I would post it here.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Story Time \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n So about an hour ago, we were making the first doordash delivery. We started driving down the persons street and about half way down, I seen a guy in all black with a completely blacked out face. I have schizophrenia and my main visual hallucination is a guy in all black with the same fully blacked out/shadowed out face just like that guy. So I just thought it was a hallucination and I was about to just ignore it. But a split second later, my sister goes “Omg! Do you see that guy?! His face is completely blacked out!” Sooo, apparently it wasn’t just my brain being fun. So I looked into the rear view mirror and watched him walking half way in the middle of the road towards us. We reached the end of the street and had to turn around and I lost sight of him for the 3 seconds it took us to turn around and he was suddenly gone. We drove down the street a couple of times and he was just gone. We looked in between houses and everything. But he just vanished. The sun was up and bright, so it wasn’t like low light playing tricks.\n\nSo that’s how our day started.",

        "text": "TLDR: I heard my dad voice who recently passed away. \nA small back story: My dad passed march 25th this year, it’s been tuff especially with bigger family holidays (ie thanksgiving and Christmas). I have had a few dreams of my dad but most have been nightmares or ones where I see him but he doesn’t talk to me or acknowledge me. One I remember was he came back and got healed and I went to hug him and told him I love him ,he just stood there and didn’t notice me or one was I was in my old house before they moved a few hours away, and the dream was insanely detailed, like my house was exactly how it was before we moved, and I just saw him pacing the dinning room but he never looked at me. Those are sometimes hard ones. Anyways, I am a night owl I stay up late but last night around 12 or so I was exhausted and decided to fall asleep at a semi decent time for me. I woke up maybe around 3 or 4 for a second and was half awake, then  I heard my dad’s voice crystal clear like he was in the room .. it wasn’t anything crazy long it was just a “hey,..” and my nick name and the tone sounded  like he was going to ask me something. I wasn’t dreaming of him before I woke up or when I was falling back asleep. But , I jolted  up and looked around and then remembered he isn’t with me anymore and when I jolted up i almost had a feeling it was day time but it was late at night . I didn’t know where else to post this but could he been letting me know he is with me in spirit. Side note it didn’t scare me or anything just made me think more,",

Ofc i got a little freaked out but didn't think too much of it and I closed the door and went back to bed. \n\nThe footsteps are always constant even if everybody's in bed and every friend that has stayed the night says they hear it too so I didn't know what to make of it at first. then one night I left my door open I don't know why i did, but sometime after midnight ( after my parents had went to sleep) and i had suddenly woken up to a figure in my doorway i thought it was my dad or my mom at first and i had said something along the lines of whats up is something wrong. \n\nThe only thing that was bringing in light was the moon so i couldn't make out a face or any major features just somebody standing in my doorway and being stupid i got up and went right up to whatever the thing was and tried to put my hand on them to say something but my hand went right through them and they dematerialized. \n\nI had screamed for my parents because i was petrified. and this isn't the only thing that has happened to me and my family before so ill post some other stories later",

        "text": "This happened 3 years ago when I was still in high school. My school is very far from my home so I ride the train. Sometimes a friend would go with me. We would usually encounter our classmate along with her boyfriend in front of us, we never really spoke with each other. But we know it's them because of their size differences, HER HEIGHT. Our classmate is a girl and she's very small, smaller than the average small height. I think she's around my chest level and I'm just around 156cm. She also has curly hair, which is rare in my country. Her boyfriend is tall and big. My friend and I would always try and walk past them on the way to the train. We never greet them because we're too shy.\n\n\nOne day, we had a group project over at another classmates' house. That girl classmate was also invited. We started getting to know each other and she told me that she thinks I'm cool and wants to be friends with me and that she would always see me entering the school at around 9am but she's too shy to approach me....... I went silent... Because as far as I know I'm always late for class. I would be at the school at around 12pm-12:30pm, NEVER too early. I told her that it wasn't me. But she told me that it REALLY was me, she told me the details of how I would get off my ride and cross the highway running like a penguin. Well, she's actually right, everyone tells me that I ran like a penguin when I have a backpack on me. She continued explaining-- I wore a blue hoodie, black/yellow addidas bag and a huge black headphones so it would be easy to identify me. Our country has a hot weather and no one would wear stupid hoodies during daytime except me. \n\n\nI then told her about how my friend and I also saw her and her boyfriend every after school on the way to the train station. She looked at me weirdly and told us that it wasn't them and that they actually go the opposite way.  They don't have anything to do on the way to the train station..... CHILLS.... I defended what I said and told her that it's them. I know that her boyfriend wears white glasses and that's also rare because I haven't seen a guy at our school who wears the same glasses.\n\nWe started exchanging weird looks and I asked her if she's messing with me. She then texted her boyfriend and asked him about how she would always point out to him that she sees me during 9am entering the school grounds. She asked her boyfriend what I wore and he explained clearly--- blue hoodie, black headphone, black/yellow bag, running like a penguin across the street...\n\n\nSo... They would see me at 9am entering the school and I would see them walking to the train station at around 7pm.... It doesn't make sense. After our conversation happened, \"those\" never showed up again. \n\n\nI still think about that incident everyday after years. It was a bizarre situation. It continued to happen until we noticed it. It just stopped after we found out about it. I've been with different classmates on the way to the train so I have other witnesses. We never know why it happened. Was it dopple gangers???? What would've happened to us if we approached \"those\" things??? I think we were lucky that we did not approach them. Who knows what those things are. \n\n\n[English is not my first language so forgive me if I have errors]",

I always sleep with my head facing the same direction (the left), which would give me a good view of the room on the other side of the hallway which didn’t t have a door. I have insomnia btw, but this night it felt… important that I went to sleep fast, and I was luckily able to do so. And I had a dream where I was in a strange place that looked somewhat similar to the hall you fight sans in on a genocide route in Undertale. At the end of the hall is a strange looking person who was saying something to herself in a quiet chanting-singing voice about “Following The Willow Wisps”. She looked up at me and repeats it before telling me to wake up. Now, I almost always have lucid dreams (not sure if that’s why I can do it), but I can wake up from dreams whenever I want. So I did. And then, in the room on the other side of the hall, there was a glowing white ball which floated around for a few seconds and then saying something in a whisper and disappearing.\n\n\nOh yeah and the person who was in my dream, was how I imagined my dead older sister looking. She died either before or during birth and nobody ever got to see her.\n\nIf I ever see the willow wisps again, I promise I’ll follow them Margaux.",
