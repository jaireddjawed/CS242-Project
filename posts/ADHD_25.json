He said for whatever reason increments of 10 are more commonly prescribed, so doses like 15, 25, 35 are usually still available. If you‚Äôre having trouble finding adderall near you and you are prescribed a dose of an even number, try asking your doc to bump you up or down by 5mg so it‚Äôs an odd number and see if you can find that. My area has dealt with shortages but my 15mg prescription was filled the same day.\n\nJust wanted to pass this along in case it helped anyone.",

I don‚Äôt really make Reddit posts, but I‚Äôll keep it as organized as can be.  \n\nFrom my own experience, and with friends.\nThis is  a reminder for the parents who have children with ADHD.\n\nPlease, for the love of god, don‚Äôt call your children Lazy. \nDon‚Äôt tell them they are being ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù by not doing chores or when they genuinely forget homework, or ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this to me? Why can‚Äôt you just clean your room and do chores?‚Äù Don‚Äôt criminalize your child with an adult conversation they don‚Äôt know how to have when you get frustrated because they couldn‚Äôt keep up with home work because they have a hard time learning.\nDon‚Äôt expect all your problems to be solved with medicine. Adderall and other brands only help for the time being, not the entire damn day, and sometimes the dosage isn‚Äôt strong enough to begin with.\nDon‚Äôt blame your kids when they don‚Äôt have an outlet or tools to cope with their ADHD, or how to find ways around to deal with it.\nStop telling them ‚ÄúThis will happen‚Äù or ‚ÄúSomeday you will learn‚Äù to things they are struggling with because of their ADHD. That does not help them at all. It makes it even worse.\n\nWhen you tell your kid crap like that, it only makes them feel like they aren‚Äôt capable, like they can‚Äôt do things. They become even worse, and then you wonder why they aren‚Äôt doing certain things anymore. \n\nInstead of getting mad when something is done, ask them to come down and help do it at that moment. \n\n\nInstead of ridiculing them for bad grades, lack of focus, get them something to help with it, a fidget, ask what distracts them. Ask a teacher if they can adjust something specifically for them. \nTake them to Therapy so they can talk through their daily struggles.\nTest what dosage can help them better focus during the hard times. \nAdvocate for them. You are an adult. Stop antagonizing and putting your kids down because they are struggling with ADHD. You only make them feel like they really are that, and it‚Äôs a downhill spiral.\n\nDo you not think your kid is frustrated with themselves to?\n\nTake this advice from me, an 18 year old who had to deal with this, and still do. I am starting therapy now, because I never had tools to cope with my ADHD, and it is hurting me bad right now. I am failing a Class in college and the decline for me to just keep up with classes, work, and basic life is hard. Time management is hard, and I am almost always late to work and class. \n\nSo please, take more consideration into your kids or others who struggle with ADHD. It isn‚Äôt just as easy as ‚ÄúThey are lazy.‚Äù",

(I know that some things must be controlled with behavioral changes, so I‚Äôm not referring to those in this thread.) How do you know when you need a higher dose or a different class of stimulants? \n\nI am still new to this diagnosis (3 months) and I am only entering my 5th week of stimulant meds (we tried 2 non-stims first but they were awful). I had hoped that medication would be life-changing the way I‚Äôve heard people talk about (this sub, YouTube, TikTok). And even living with my friend who has had ADHD and been on Adderall IR since she was a teenager, I saw the on-and off-medication aspects of her characteristics. On medication, she‚Äôs super organized and gets motivated to take on major projects. \n\nI expected that level of motivation and organization when I started Adderall IR, but it never happened. The only change when it came to becoming better about organizing and decluttering my life was being able to stick with or return to the main task at that time instead bouncing around the house, never making a dent anywhere because I can‚Äôt stay in one spot long enough. But now I‚Äôm seeing so many people say that the meds aren‚Äôt a major fix for the motivation or organization, and much of it requires behavioral adjustments. I‚Äôm now working with a therapist on some strategies and also from listening to other people who have it. \n\nNow that I‚Äôm adjusting my thinking (there was a brief battle of cognitive dissonance at first), I‚Äôm wondering if this particular stimulant is the best one and how would I know? If experiencing a sudden burst of motivation isn‚Äôt going to happen to signify that it‚Äôs working, then I have to observe all the other traits. At first, I felt so extremely calm (sometimes sleepy) and it felt nice, physically and mentally. The first couple days, I would have rated that the medication improved most of my negative behaviors at a 4 or 5 out of 5, such as my inability to sit still in my chair, without my leg bouncing 100 mph or to stand without swaying back and forth. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before becoming tolerant of such a low dose (5mg X 2). The rating dropped to 1-3 for most behaviors on most days, so she increased it to 10mg X 2. However, the rating is 3 for the most irritating behaviors and 4 for the less annoying ones. I know that 20mg per day is not a high dose, but how do I know if I need a higher dose or a different type of stimulant, such as Ritalin or that family? My friend told me that her childhood friend didn‚Äôt get any benefits from Adderall and had to switch to Ritalin.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been holding off from making this post, simply from not knowing what to say. I was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type and co-morbid Tourette‚Äôs just last summer, even though it was blatantly apparent before then. Up until 21 I had just thought I was depressed; been to therapy, tried multiple meds, nothing seemed to work. \n\nI was/ am completely exhausted and since leaving school I feel that I haven‚Äôt reached my potential at all. The support which I had at home while in school seemed to mask the discovery of my adhd. I‚Äôve always been highly academic, flying through Grammar school with straight a‚Äôs. My final two years (A-Levels in the uk) were hell. I essentially don‚Äôt study at all, but still managed to get decent grades. \n\nIn typical Indecisive fashion, I choose to go ALONE to university in England on a course I should not of done. Leaving behind my true passion, English Literature, Poetry, Philosophy and film. I ended up dropping out because of severe depression. I also used to play soccer to the highest level available in my country, eventually getting into bodybuilding and training nearly twice a day 6 days a week, while trying to juggle a job and social life. \n\nI‚Äôve since gone back to uni, completing a year and a half of English and psychology before deferring this year to Literature and creative writing. The old me seems like a shadow. Like I‚Äôm living a completely different life now. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just asking for advice, tips knowledge about myself that I don‚Äôt even understand I.e why I burnout and go into month long depressions. Why I can so closely monitor my nutrition and training yet can binge and fall off . I‚Äôve been on medication since the summer, Ritalin to be exact. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the correct one for me even.. (if you have any questions you‚Äôd like to ask to figure me out better please ask! For those of you that have read the post thankyou!)",

I tried self medicating with alcohol which helped my executive function but turns out i cannot afford it. \n\nI am impulsive with spending so sometimes i have spent too much on ordering food and for a week or two I wont have that much to eat. Which makes me ashamed of myself. I feel like i am a kid or a drug addict that gets deeply upset the second I don't get my hit of dopamine.\n\nBeen waiting for over 1 year to get treatment because i don't officially have the diagnosis yet. Only was halfaway confirmed by a bunch of tests through accidently doing an autism evaluation (that i dont have). \n\nI feel so burned out and beaten down by life. I feel like mentally i am trying to lift a mountain whenever i have to do household obligations like doing the dishes, cooking or cleaning. And the constant messups, spilling something so i gotta clean it, breaking something while doing the dishes so i gotta buy something new, finally affording a new sweater only to spill some oil or soy saus on it. \n\nI have given up on socializing. I can never pay attention, i have to force myself not to say every stupid thing i am thinking so others dont get offended. It's hard for me to set boundaries on time because i dont even know where my head is half of the time. I feel so alone and isolated. People constantly misunderstand what I say and either get suspicious, offended or just distance themselves. It's so lonely. \n\nI have had 5 therapists throughout my life, none of them evaluated me or suspected I had ADHD because i am a female. The failure of therapy made me feel like im impossible to treat, like there is something seriously wrong with me. \n\nNow that i am by the finish line and might get an appointment in a month or two, I feel like truly giving up. I have never been this depressed, lonely and sad. All these years with so much trauma, I Will never get them back. \n\nThere is a voice in my head saying, will treatment really work? Will I ever feel like I belong, fit in, be accepted, being in a workplace amongst colleagues or will I always feel on the outside looking in, always feeling inferior. Will this life-long depression ever lift, will the light ever shine again.\n\nIn addition, I have always been passively suicidal, mostly when i experience sensory issues, but also i think they might be intrusive thoughts because they are fast and automatic. I don't know if they Will ever go away.\n\nJust really need some hope, light or progress. \n\nHave a great weekend and thanks for reading",

Trying to see if others are in the same boat as myself. \n\nSee below for context. TL;DR included as well. \n\n# Context\n\nI am a trans man who's dealt with ADD for a majority of my life. Prior to taking HRT, I struggled with ADD, primarily inattentive. It affected me severely, but for multiple reasons, I didn't know I had ADD at the time. I just thought I was spacey, a procrastinator, a \"the only deadline that scares me enough to do anything is the final deadline\" type of person. Got good grades at the expense of my mental health blah blah blah. Fast-forward to being diagnosed, I was able to connect the dots that I've struggled with ADD all my life. But my ADD changed the further I got into my physical transition. To be frank, it became more severe in the inattentive realm. I also started experiencing hyperactivity. I would have to leave college lectures to go take a 3 minute walk or something because I felt the classic \"there's a motor in me that won't stop running\". These days, things have leveled out, but I cannot imagine a life without ADD meds at this point. I am now 6+ years on HRT. Have been medicated for ADHD for 5+ years. The days I'm off ADD meds are miserable. \n\nI've read several articles that cis women who go through menopause can display new or worse symptoms of ADD because of the drop in estrogen levels ([example article](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-and-menopause)), but I'm pretty sure testosterone-based HRT just outcompetes estrogen in the battle of dominant hormone as opposed to lowering estrogen levels. I may be wrong though. Google isn't helping in answering this question unfortunately and I don't recall my endo mentioning my estrogen levels ever since my T levels have been in-range since I've started treatment. \n\n# TL;DR: \n\nI am a trans man. Prior to taking HRT, I had untreated but mostly manageable ADD, little hyperactivity. A few months or a year into HRT, my ADD became more severe in the inattentive realm and my hyperactivity skyrocketed. The \"progression\" stopped a while ago because I'm medicated and I'm no longer experiencing big physical changes from T, but I'm curious if anyone else has dealt with this?",

Its been 5 weeks. However, the obsession still is not over and when i think of moving on to something else, i get quite anxious and just end up going back to the drama series again in one of it's forms that Ive already consumed. Back when it was really bad, i was binge watching the TV show every moment I could and was quite nervous/anxious/on edge when I wasn't. It definitely got in the way of homework, sleeping, and eating. \n\nI guess I just wanna know if anyone else is like me lol When I tried to find a thread or something on the internet about this, I came up empty.

        "text": "Hi there, I‚Äôll try to keep this brief. After years of suspecting I had ADHD, I (33F) finally started making moves to be evaluated and get my mental health on track. Since I was a kid, I‚Äôve struggled with organization and task initiation both in school and in my personal life. On and off for the last seven years, I‚Äôve been on various SSRIs and anti-anxiety medications for depression and anxiety, and none of them helped. About a year ago, I started seeing a psych nurse who started me on Prozac and a therapist to un-funk my brain. After about eight months of having my Prozac dosage upped with very little return on the increases, I finally had a slight breakdown in my psych nurse‚Äôs office because I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I couldn‚Äôt accomplish things (housework, repetitive tasks at work) the way other people could. So she puts me on 5mg of Adderall XR. Folks, I feel like I‚Äôm finally myself. Everyone I know has noticed a change in me for the better. Life since I started Adderall has been so markedly better‚Äî I take better care of myself, work has gotten easier, and I‚Äôm even more social and dating again. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, when I get my assessment results back from the neuropsychologist. The doctor explains that she was shocked at how high my IQ numbers were (cool, I wasn‚Äôt super concerned with that), but that there were very few indicators signaling issues my sustained attention, mental organization skills, and executive function. She said that results like mine, based on my responses to a T/F, 200-question inventory on my emotions suggest a diagnosis of anxiety and mild depression. I expressed a lot of worry and indicated a variety of stressors on the inventory, which to her suggests that any attention issues I have are emotionally-based, not indicative of ADHD. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure why, but I‚Äôm crushed. She said that maybe there‚Äôs a chance that I‚Äôve been able to develop compensatory strategies to help me cope and that she believes that the symptoms I‚Äôve indicated that align with ADHD are real. I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be able to access the medication that‚Äôs finally started to make a difference for me. I feel like a fraud for finding comfort and solidarity in a community that I apparently don‚Äôt belong to. \n\nI‚Äôd appreciate any advice or words of wisdom. I‚Äôm not really sure what to do, especially if I begin to plateau on my current dosage of Adderall or if my PCP decides she doesn‚Äôt want to prescribe it anymore.",

        "text": "Like the title says. I know I have to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday but more often than not I skip most of these. Then when I get hungry I just eat cookies, because those are no prep and easy to eat.\n\nI've tried so many things to create balanced nutrition but I feel like I keep failing. For breakfast I have quite a solid working plan: I make a smoothie that tastes nice and is high in protein. For this I specifically have a portable blender so I don't even have to leave my bed to make it in the morning (the fridge is right next to my bed since I live in a student room). The issue however is cleaning the blender. I keep forgetting it/lack energy to clean it. Then in the morning my blender is still dirty and I skip the smoothie. Sometimes I try to replace it with croissants or something else that I can just pop in the oven and don't need to prep/wash any dishes for.\n\nLunch is the absolute worst part of my day food wise. I try to make it the evening before but quite often forget. When I don't forget to make it I either forget to eat the lunch or I really don't feel like eating what I've made (sensory annoyments differ day by day). This causes me to skip lunch most of the days or buy some ready made sandwich which is really expensive (I mean 3 euro's for plain bread with cheese??)\n\nDinner is kind of okay, I quite often eat ready made meals. The thing with this is that it contains a lot of sugar and salt, which I don't like. Added sugars also messes with my concentration. I try to make dinner as easy as possible - mealprepping, using rice that only has to be heated not cooked, frozen veggies. But still, most of the days I lack energy to even spend 10 minutes on dinner.\n\nFor snacks I don't even know where to start. I eat at least one banana a day since it doesn't need any preparation. Sometimes also mandarins but those are more seasonal. The other fruits require too much prep (I can't bite off apples/pears), which causes them to go bad and me having to throw them away.\n\nSo in the end I always have to throw a lot of food away because I didn't eat it and I eat very unbalanced and a lot of days also too little. I really really want to change it but I don't know how. I've asked so many people, but they tell me I just have to cook/make something easy and set alarms to eat. I feel like they don't understand the struggle I have with it and idk I was hoping someone here understands and maybe has some useful tips",

They brought in a psychiatrist in primary because they thought I had dyslexia, turns out it was \"memory loss\" - when we talk about someone he could say; \"I think they have ADHD, they're really busy all the time\", though they could have no inattentive signs. \n\nI kept telling him the inattentive signs that I have and I think he honestly thinks i'm lying lmao, I don't get it. I don't get how someone could have no idea of the other signs rather than the hyperactivity. It's like he doesn't want to believe it. It's so easy to do some research. I just wish people could see what i'm seeing, the knowledge that I have. I have more signs of ADHD than anything but he would still say; \"Maybe you're autistic\" when I don't have that many traits, but it makes more sense to him (?).",

        "text": "Hi all. I've been on Concerta 18 mg for about 4 months straight now. Initially, it helped me out and I was actualy getting things done and was able to focus for 6-10 hours a day. I really felt the positive effects then. However, recently, I don't feel the effects as strong as before, and my symptoms of inattentiveness, getting all fidgety, and not being able to sit still while finishing a task resurfaced again (usually after 6 hrs of taking my usual 18). I already brought this up with my therapist, and she suggested that we increase the dose to 27 mg on my next follow-up.\n\nI've had a few 27 mg tabs of Concerta left from my prescription a year ago, and tried those instead of my usual 18 mg now to help me decide if I agree with the dose titration on the next follow-up. I feel like it's too much. I've tried it only 2-3 times now, and each time, 2-3 hrs after I take the 27 mg I feel mixed emotions of sleepiness, anxiety and overstimulation and I was not able to accomplish much on those days cause I ended up being anxious all day. Is this normal? Should I agree to the 27 mg increase and wait a week or two for my body to adjust? Honestly, I felt so uncomfortable on the 27. Btw, previously, I was able to try this dose for about a week prior to finding out I was pregnant, thus was advised to discontinue it immediately then so I wasn't to feel it out more.\n\nI've been obsessively thinking a lot about the right dose for me.  I'm wondering if an 18mg spaced 2 times a day would be more beneficial for me, given the unbearable intensity of the 27 mg in a single dose.. or 18 mg once then ask for 5 mg ritalin spaced two times more further through out the day?\n\nI want to know how'd it go for you guys to find the right dose? Or if anyone has any input/experience regarding my frustration. For those who have multiple times a day dosing, what time do you usually take the follow-ups?\n\nI'm extremely concerned about getting the right dose now more than ever because I've been studying for a major exam which I'm taking next month. I've been preparing for it for about 6 months already and it's frustrating cause this is happening a month before the scheduled date. Fml.\n\nThank you in advance guys.",

I want to begin by saying that I realise how frustrating it must be for people struggling with diagnosed ADHD that so many people seem to be self-diagnosing ADHD these days, but please hear me out. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in my twenties and have been taking an SRI antidepressant for nearly 30 years. This drug causes kidney damage with long-term use. I‚Äôve always known that there is something different about me. I‚Äôm a constant daydreamer with a butterfly mind. I have an inner ‚Äúcavewoman‚Äù who must be soothed with music or food before I can settle to any task. I am messy and disorganised because when I‚Äôm in the middle of one task I get distracted by another; I procrastinate; I obsess over things; I enthusiastically start projects, buy all the stuff, then lose interest; I make impulsive purchases; I can‚Äôt shift focus easily and my husband is constantly having to repeat himself; life sometimes overwhelms me and I‚Äôm paralysed by apathy. The list goes on‚Ä¶ \nI wonder if I should approach the doctor about checking me for ADHD just in case I‚Äôm on the wrong meds. What do you all think? Am I one of those people who is ‚Äújumping on the bandwagon‚Äù to the detriment of those who are truly victims of ADHD? I‚Äôm mostly worried about my kidneys tbh.",

It's not a choice, its a neurological disorder. \n\n\nI'm feeling deflated and frankly disgusted after coming across an AITA post by the partner of a woman with comorbid depression and ADHD. Her own partner calls her a slob and tells her she needs to just act like an adult, and seeks validation from strangers on the internet who aren't educated about ADHD or comorbid mental disorders. The comments are unanimously awful, OP's partner has been called a filthy pig, disgusting, childish and a toddler and that she deserves to just live alone and wallow in her filth. Countless people have told her she just needs to grow up and clean up, she's not a child, there's nothing stopping her from just doing tasks, she needs to stop acting like a baby and just grow up. \n\n\nNobody would tell someone with diabetes to just grow up and produce insulin. \nNobody would ask someone with a neurological disorder like a brain injury or learning disability to just grow up and stop acting like a child and clean their kitchen, and that its not hard. \n\n\nSomehow people can wrap their head around other neurological disorders and differences affecting executive functioning. But just not ADHD. I just don't get it. Are they being deliberately obtuse just to be cruel to people with neurological disorders?",

I thought this was the reason I find no joy or excitement in life, in pursuing hobbies or doing anything that can enrich my life. I have a list of things I want to try and start forming my hobbies around but I keep putting it off due to either laziness or not feeling like everything is in the right place for me to go 100% into the hobby immediately, and then I feel guilty and anxious as my brain keeps yelling at me to go do the thing but I end up wasting my time online. I've never had any hobbies or interests since childhood and I'm 26 now, and I feel so empty and numb as a human being. Feel like I'm wasting oxygen. I also cannot stick to anything (like learning guitar) because I'm not good at it immediately and I lose interest to keep going. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll throughout my education I've always had immense trouble listening to verbal instructions and comprehending concepts. In my new job, I'm being told a bunch of new information verbally and even as I'm writing down the information my brain cannot keep up with the information coming in as I write. I have to ask people to repeat themselves 4 or 5 times because I simply could not hear them even though, objectively, they're talking directly and clearly to me. As an engineer amongst the coworkers I feel like such an idiot for not knowing supposedly common and basic knowledge. Let alone I can't even remember anything I studied at uni.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so lost in life because of these issues. Dating is hard because I can't share anything interesting about my life/ hobbies because I don't do anything, then at work I'm having to go through basic stuff multiple times just to retain it and there's a good chance I'll forget it within a week anyway.

My medication isn't kicking in and as much as I know I absolutely should not, I am tempted to double dose.\n\nOn bad days, my partner always asks me why I can't just take the day off then - I work for myself and make my own schedules. I don't know how to verbally express how much I literally cannot do that. If I never wrestled myself into making myself do things I fucking hate doing, I would never do a single thing at all. I've tried explaining this to my therapist, too - if I didn't force myself to work, or do anything I don't *feel like* doing, I would just never do anything, ever.\n\nI can understand my partner not grasping this, but how does a therapist not understand. If I didn't make myself get up and work, and just did things I felt like doing, I'd never get out of bed. The anxiety of doing nothing with my life is the only thing that motivates me to do anything, ever, and if I let myself only do things that feel nice at the time, I'd literally just lay in bed browsing memes on my phone 24/7 every single day of the week, every month, every year for the rest of my life. There is no such thing as finite length of time that I could lay in bed, there is no *enough*. I get up when I make myself get up, when the anxiety overpowers the reluctance to get up.\n\nThere is no such thing as me thinking \"hmm, I've rested enough, now I want to do my work again.\" I am in my dream career, doing the exact thing I always wanted to do for a living, and nonetheless I have to *make myself do it*. The limit does not exist. And I don't know how something that is such a defining cornerstone of my entire existence is a completely foreign concept to people who are not me, and I don't know how to explain it to them.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nSorry for language mistakes, english is not my native. \n\nWell since I remember I had some silly problems in my life while in same time being one of best students in school/ college/ university etc. In next year I have one of the hardest exams that even exist in my country and I am starting to learn to it. I am on something like prosecutor vocational training and I am studying and doing semi-half prosecutor job. \n\nWhat I've noticed since practicing I am often doing silly mistakes in official letters or when trying to fast read court files I am missing something what is important for case. Well in my studying it wasn't a huge problem because most of time I was reading alot same text, from another sources and I was always doing very great on exams. I justify myself that I am not prosecutor yet so it is only practice I don't meet people in cases, I just write some accidental things so I don't follow case from 0 to end because it is how this practices work. But last time I started to think it is not enough justify for that what is going on, so maybe I have some disorder and started to read what my cause my problems. \n\nWhen I read I have most of the ADHD sympthoms  mostly connected with  attention deficit disorder. I always though it is not the problem for me, of course I heard of what ADHD is (or atleast I though I know what it is), because I was learning fast, good, when I wanted to pass exam I always did it without any problems. I sometimes procastinated but compared to my friends in same school I often started doing things before them or with higher intensity and was sucessful in it. I already started to learn to exam I have in more than a year, so hard to say it is procastination. I had not problems in understanding any processes in math, physics etc. So when I read ADHD problems are with school and  physical activity it wasn't me. Well I have  restless legs syndrome when I am in stress or really focused but I never had problems with it no one said me I am too active and should calm down. \n\nWhat my sympthoms are:\n\n\\-  my sense of direction is pretty awful. I am using GPS to get to places I was many times before. If I am leading a car with sometime dont know me well I was twice or more asked that I am really living here from born? I also sometimes do illegal maneuvers because I didn't focus on traffic signs. But expect that I am driving very calm so I didn't have any even a little crash. If I am in new place and we are going to some spot and then getting back to previous one then I always dont know how to do it. \n\n\\- I always forget where I left things or forget to catch up things to job. Very often I leave phone in car and I need to go back for it when I find out I didn't take it to home, I forget keys, When someones ask me for take something like \"oh you are going to A take this items also if u were here\" I almost forget to take it. Well some ppl (or maybe not dunno yet) starting to think I have some disorder, but on same time I can do hard cases so they have hard time to figure out what is going on, because on one hand I am doing silly mistakes and on another finishing complex tasks. My wife even said to me she sometimes wonders how can I be that smart and that silly in same time. Even now I forget where is something in the kitchen even if it is there for like 2 years.\n\n\\- My multitasking is almost none. Well if someone enters a room and start talking to another person or running a radio it is almost over. Somehow I figured out how to catch up focus in these scenarios but it results in that: when I fall in hyperfocus (I read there is something like that xd) then I mostly don't even hear someone is talking to me or wants something from me, for sure I can't  listen with understanding before I stop doing my work. Still if I am very interested in anything then can fall very deep in focus and do my exercises fast and good, but as I said before I have problems with checking if I did task properly because when chekcing out stuff I did I have hard time to focus on it so even if I am checking it I often check it wrong leaving mistakes I did before.\n\n\\- When I am walking to job I always have \" rush of thoughts \" - I think about hobby, practices, exercises to do etc. if someone would stop me and ask what is colour of hair a person/ colour of car which just passed by me I wouldnt answer correctly for sure. \n\n\\- When I find something now that I am attracted to it like hobby, game or any other activity I always have problems with sleep or focus at all, I am starting to think on it almost all the time. Also I had 1-2 weeks sleep problems before my entrance prosecutor exam was thinking all time about possible questions etc. \n\n\\- I think I was somelike addicted to games before, maybe still I am, but I think since I am married it most like I am doing it when I have nothing to do in free time much more than addiction thing, but sometimes if I start playing something new then I can soak in it for like 2 weeks and thinking just about it. Still never had problems in any drug addiction, hazardous addiction or smth even after trying drinking playing previously some bets etc. \n\n\\- in school I hadnt access while exercises to PC, everyone was noting in paper notebooks so I was mainly focused, but right now we are noting everything on PC and its becoming hard for me because if something is too easy or too boring I am getting easly distracted and surfing through net\n\n\\- my father had same problems with losting things\n\nWell after all It is hard to do any steps for me because in prosecutor jobs it is of course hard to have any mental illness so I really don't think so I will go to get official diagnosis at all. Well I didn't even think before I started practicing that I might have that problem. Before that I passed very hard university and I got into this prosecutor vocational training which is one of the hardest things to do after university (100 spots in 50m country) but now I am starting to figure out I need to have decent abilities like multitasking, fast focus, reading emotions, doing almost no mistakes in cases and started to feel it will be very hard for me to achieve or almost impossible if my  initial diagnosis is right. Also I am starting to fear have any hobby or any other than work activities because it often leads me to that I am thinking about it too much what causing problems in focus on another things, so in incoming year I just dropped any extra activities to do not let them distract me. \n\nWell don't know what I should do at all. I am feared mostly of that it is a biological thing so it is not only about following therapy or smth because it is somehow connected with  physical deficiencies.",

        "text": "I don't know if this is adhd or something else. I haven't been able to focus on anything. The moment I try to do something, my brain literally just stops. I'll get stuck on one thought and I won't be able to move on from it. I want to write, I love writing. I have ideas and characters and everything but when I go to write, the words don't come. I'll get hung up on the first sentence and my brain will refuse to move forward. I try to draw and after the first line, my brain stops and doesn't know where to go next. There's a disconnect between what I can imagine and what I'm able to actually do. \n\nIt's a horrible feeling. It feels like I'm going insane. My brain stops and stutters and gets stuck in the mud. I'll start watching a video and 5 minutes in, I can't keep watching and have to look for something else only to repeat the process. I can't keep thoughts straight in my head. Every thought feels so fleeting. If I'm told to do something, I'll have to do it right that moment or I'll forget and it won't get done. \n\nI don't know where else to go. Maybe yall might have some advice for me. Maybe it's adhd maybe it's not. I just need some help",
