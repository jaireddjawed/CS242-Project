[{"title":"r\/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel\/Blackpill rhetoric.","author":"SyCams","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/es2cek\/rdating_is_not_the_place_to_soapbox\/","text":"There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.\n\nOur \"No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda\" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red\/black-pill ideology, \"alpha-male\" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** \n\nThis means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term \"Chad\" is unwanted and will be removed.\n\nWe can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. \n\nAt the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and\/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.\n\n**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment.

I probably stumbled on a few words, but the nerves wore off quickly. We hung out there for a couple hours but it went by fast in my head. We were  talking about our jobs, relatable experiences, funny ass stories, things we want to do. It felt nice connecting with her, the things I don't go deep with my other friends about. Afterwards, we walked through town, kept our convos going, and she showed me spots that I wasn't familair with, mostly because she knew the area really well. At the end, she gave me an intense hug, I hugged her back, and said we'd keep in touch for the upcoming week, and so we left. \n\nI get home about a half hour later, and I check my phone about an hour later so I could text her about how she was doing.

I've been cheated on, had my heart broken multiple times, and now I'm left feeling like I'll never be loved again. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I'm tired of pretending like everything is okay when it's not. Im on the edge of another failed relation and I can't stand it anymore. \n\nI've been in several relationships throughout my life, but they all ended up in disappointment. My ex-gf cheated on me with a guy who pretended was my friend, and the woman I thought was the love of my life feels more and more distant everyday. I've tried online dating, but it always seems like the women I meet are either not interested, just looking for a fling or searching men with money. \n\nAt this point, I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I feel like a piece of shit. I've lost confidence in myself, and I'm constantly questioning what's wrong with me. Why can't I find someone who will love and appreciate me for who I am? I see my friends and family in happy relationships, and it just makes me feel even more and more alone. I see myself sometimes doing long drives at night and feeling nothing more than misery. \n\nI know there are people out there who have it worse than I do, and I'm grateful for what I do have in my life. But sometimes, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm tired of being the one who gets hurt, and I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever find true love, hanging on hope, when there is no hope to speak of. It's hard to love when all I can feel is hate for myself. \n\nI'm reaching out to the Reddit community because I need to know if there are others out there who have gone through similar experiences. How did you overcome your feelings of hopelessness and despair? Is it possible to find love again after so much disappointment? I feel nobody will live me and that it's so hard to find someone at 41. I feel I have so much love and passion to give but nobody will ever know. Sometimes I feel I have no more reason to be in this world.

Great date with a not great ending- no judgement please","author":"throwawaylastsupper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11pvubv\/post_date_recap_40f_42m_great_date_with_a_not\/","text":"I (40F) had a first date\/hookup with a guy (42M) Friday night. We've been talking for 6 weeks, so there has been a fair amount of buildup. But, at the same time, I went into it as I do with most online dates- fully expecting I may never see or talk to this guy again. This is the nature of online dating, sadly.\n\nHe looked mostly as I expected. I think there is always like a slight difference, as the mind interprets photos and real-life a bit differently. I wasn't unhappy with what I saw. He was a good looking guy. As for me, I am well-aware that I am pretty photogenic. I tried to send him realistic pictures of me, in addition to the gorgeous ones. I asked him for video chat multiple times. I felt like video chat may give him a more authentic idea of what I looked like, but he kept coming up with excuses on why not to. Ultimately, my biggest worry was that despite my attempts, I would look different than what he expected. That stereotypical, \"You look bigger in person.\"\n\nWe walked to a local diner, which was unexpectedly closed, so we ended up driving to another restaurant instead. We chatted over \"breakfast for dinner.\" Well....he talked. A lot. And I tried to keep up and offer something to the conversation. But, it was still nice. Very casual, very comfortable.\n\nWe went back to his place where he made some hot chocolate, and we sipped on hot chocolate and chatted. We were discussing our pets growing up, and he kissed me mid-conversation. Ha. It was a great kiss. A great kiss. We continued to kiss for a minute or so, and then pulled back and continued conversation. Things got a bit more touchy-feely. And then more and more kisses.....and then one thing led to another...\n\nThe sex was solid...and plentiful. I lost track of how many times, but I think it was about 5. But, the best part was laying in bed having real conversations. Not this faux deep existential, \"What does it all mean?\" BS. But...about his Dad's cancer. And how certain personality traits have shaped our perspectives. About risk tolerance and risk vs reward.\n\nSo, we were in bed until about 3 am. Either talking or the other thing. Cuddles and occasional kisses. Maybe a little catnap sprinkled in between there. The conversation just flowed. And then...it didn't. At about 3:30 am, he got up, I thought to go to the bathroom, but he was actually showering. He didn't invite me, by the way. When he came back, he had boxers on and was a lot less cuddly.\n\nI didn't really think much of it, as I fell asleep shortly thereafter. I did notice when I woke up that he hadn't migrated over to my side of the bed. He wasn't snuggled up or anything. He was in his own little cocoon on the other side of the bed. (Despite us both talking previously how enjoyable morning cuddles are). I was a little annoyed, but not concerned. We were up late....so I figured he was just zonked out. \n\nBut, I had to leave relatively early. So...I waited for him to start stirring. 7 am came and went. 7:30 came and went. 8 am came and went. He was kind of mumbling in his sleep. But, he never really came to. So, finally around 8:40 am, I got dressed. I shook him gently and let him know I had to leave soon. He briefly opened his eyes and said something about feeling hot and cold at the same time. But, he seemed pretty out of it, not like he was pretending to be asleep or something. Then, he rolled over. Ugh. \n\nI was hoping he would at least wake up long enough for us to de-brief, have a morning-after conversation, have a brief cuddle, or heck, at least a hug goodbye and walk me to my car. But....he just never came around. I really didn't want to do the dip while he slept. It just feels icky to me. Even if I tried to let him know I was leaving. Even if maybe he just didn't care. It still felt icky. But...it came to a point that I had to leave. So, I did.\n\nI did write out a note, thanking him for the evening, and left it on his night stand. Then, I travelled home. (About 3 hours) And, I never heard from him. Never heard from him. Not a \"Thanks for coming out.\" Not a \"Let me know you get home okay.\" Nothing. I came to the determination that between him acting cold\/asleep in the morning and not talking to me all day, I had truly been ghosted. \n\nIt's been a very long while since I have been straight-up ghosted after a first date, which I guess makes me lucky? Usually there is some conversational flow afterwards. Sometimes, it is agreed that things won't work out. But...we typically remain friendly and continue to talk, or maybe talk periodically, or a lot of the time, it just sort of tapers off eventually. I had forgotten how much that immediate first-date ghosting stings. \n\nI didn't technically consider myself \"ghosted\" yet, but it felt like it was heading in that direction for sure. I was going to reach out to him in a few days and see where it got me. Anyway...he did reach out yesterday evening, thanking me for my note. There wasn't much of a conversation, just a couple of lines back and forth to each other. \n\nI guess you could say I didn't continue the conversation, but he didn't really give me anything to respond to, just two words: \"True story.\" I didn't really reply, and he hasn't reached out again either. I don't want to come across as overeager or clingy. \n\nIn my experience, it's sometimes a good idea to take a beat after a date, give some space and take some time. But, then again....sometimes, if a guy is interested, it's very clear. So, I don't know whether to assume the great part of the date was real, or if the sour part of the date was real. \n\nAm I foolish to think something may come of this?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678669909.0},{"title":"My partner said some weird things, am i overreacting?","author":"OpenedPandoraBox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11pv8si\/my_partner_said_some_weird_things_am_i\/","text":"\nSo a few weeks ago, me and my partner were talking about depression and he said women are unhappy because \"they aren't having children and changing diapers\". \nHe also tries to bring up race at random times, even when it's not relevant or needs to be brought.

Ever since we became close, we started having little arguments mainly due to miscommunication\/misinterpretations.\n\nLast night, we just had a major argument, resulting in him becoming really upset at me, which I deserve. We were having a conservation through text, and he randomly brought up about this nightclub. I told him how it\u2019s funny because I just searched up that exact nightclub earlier yesterday. He asked me why I searched it up, and I said I just wanted to see what it looks inside. He said \u201cNo one looks up the inside of a club for no reason\u201d and I replied \u201cI look up random things okayy because I\u2019ve never been there\u201d He then kept asking me \u201cBut why? There\u2019s always a reason\u201d and then followed by \u201cDo your friends want to go or smt?\u201d And then I said \u201cWell yeah my friends did mention they want to go with me sometime\u201d\n\nHe then said \u201cI knew someone asked!\u201d And then he proceeded to ask me if I\u2019m still going to this rave later this month. I told him \u201cyeah maybe..\u201d\nAnd then few conversations later, he straight up told me \u201cJust be straight forward next time \u2018maybe\u2019 isn\u2019t a yes or no to me and you saying just looking at a club for fun. \ud83e\udd28\u201d\n\nNow, he said this because he thinks no one looks up the club for no reason. He said \u201cLike why couldn\u2019t you just tell me your friends wanna go to the club? It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d And he told me I shouldn\u2019t say \u201cmaybe\u201d and should\u2019ve said yes or not because he thinks I\u2019m actually going to the rave, when in reality I\u2019m actually still thinking about going so that\u2019s why I said \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m hiding something from him because I wasn\u2019t being that clear twice in the row. I might admit it\u2019s my fault for not clarifying it more with him because I did actually look up the club because my friends do want to go with me. But I looked up that club more specifically because I was randomly curious to see what it looks like, and I tried defending myself on that, but he just doesn\u2019t seem to believe me on this.\n\nBecause of that, he thinks I seemed so afraid of telling him that. But I was also truthful about saying \u201cmaybe\u201dabout going to the rave. I just didn\u2019t clarify the reason enough why I\u2019m still thinking about going in the first place.\n\nHe got upset at me and I tried telling him \u201cI\u2019d never lie or hide from you. I was actually looking up photos of the club randomly for fun. For the rave, I said maybe I\u2019m still actually thinking of going because our group isn\u2019t big enough, and I really wanted you to come, that\u2019s why I asked you to come. But I guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time.\u201d\nHe replied to that with \u201c \u201cI guess\u201d nice way to end it\u201d , referring to how I wrote \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time\u201d in that text. And that\u2019s all after that.\n\nI tried my best to communicate with him and clear more things up for him, but he was giving me dry responses. I kept apologizing and reassuring him that I\u2019m being honest and I have nothing to hide from him and I\u2019m not afraid to talk to him, over and over. I can honestly understand how he thought I was hiding something last night because I wasn\u2019t being straightforward. But I also feel like he was being too hard on me last night.\n\nThis morning, I kept asking if we could call so we could talk about it and work on communicating more. He told me \u201cNo you did this to yourself, so not my fault\u201d and \u201cYou keep saying we need to communicate better and it\u2019s you that\u2019s screwing up\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear you say sorry anymore\u201d\n\nEventually I finally got him to call me and I tried apologizing again and explaining myself. But he gave me silent treatment for 10-15 mins and acted very upset and cold to me. He thinks I\u2019m just repeating myself over and over again on what I\u2019ve said on text beforehand, and how it\u2019s a waste of time for him. He thinks I can\u2019t change for what I did, and he doesn\u2019t want to think anymore. I told him I\u2019ll work on communicating better and he said \u201cWhatever I hope so.\u201d\n\nWe got silent after that and he said \u201cSo..are we done now?\u201d. I asked him if he\u2019s still upset with me and he kept dodging the question and he said he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. We said our byes and he hung up really fast.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. He hasn\u2019t texted me since then. I promised to him I\u2019ll work on communicating better. I don\u2019t want to be a bad girlfriend to him or someone that would just apologize for their behavior then turn around and do it again. I really did mean it when I apologized and I take responsibility of my actions and I saw how deeply it upset him. I should\u2019ve been more clear with him.\n\nI feel like this is completely my fault because we keep telling each other to communicate with each other well, but yet, we always end up in an argument. He\u2019s generally a very caring and loving person and loves me very much and is willing to work things out with me, no matter how bad it gets. But I don\u2019t know how I feel about last night. He\u2019s so upset with me and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I really want to make this relationship work and I am really willing to do whatever it takes. I don\u2019t want this relationship to turn out unhealthy, especially since we\u2019ve been dating for only a month and we already started arguing.\n\nKeep in mind, we constantly text each other throughout the day. More than we facetime\/call each other. I tried telling him texting isn\u2019t the same as talking face-to-face in person, so it\u2019s hard to tell through texting and it could result in a lot of misinterpretations. \n\nI know I can\u2019t keep begging someone to forgive me or else it\u2019d drive them away more, so should I just give him space?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674733.0},{"title":"What does fumbling a girl mean?","author":"Independent_Slide932","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11psbj9\/what_does_fumbling_a_girl_mean\/","text":"I hear this everywhere, guys saying they \u00ab\u00a0fumbled a girl\u00a0\u00bb and I don\u2019t understand what it means, can someone explain?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678660962.0},{"title":"Don\u2019t know if I should go on a date with this girl?","author":"moonkie888","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11pxd9o\/dont_know_if_i_should_go_on_a_date_with_this_girl\/","text":"Long story short, met this girl on hinge, we have some friends in common, the date goes well but idk she went on this trip and she said she would lmk when she gets back.

So it was cool cause that was my intention to begin with that I was fine with whatever. I\u2019m over it and decided to just be friends, and we still have frequent conversations daily\n\nLast week she tells me she thinks her feelings have changed slightly but still sort of confused in a two minute audio message. She said she was wanting to say that for a while. I thought she sounded really real but my friend is putting these thoughts in my head that maybe she struck out with someone else and is just using me. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. \n\nThe last time I saw her she said she wasn\u2019t using Tinder anymore and the same day she confessed to me I posted an instagram story of an annoying Hinge message I got, which I checked afterwards to see if she saw and she did.

Appearance wise, I\u2019m very average. Mid, as the kids say. I\u2019m not pretty but I\u2019m not run-screaming-at-the-sight-of-me levels of hideous. I\u2019m tallish (5\u20199\u201d) but not model-height, yet not cute and \u201cfun-sized\u201d either. I\u2019m curvy but not overweight or super thin. (Sort of fit from weightlifting and running, busty enough to make finding clothes that fit well annoying but not \u201coh my god those things are huge\u201d busty, big butt but not music video big, etc. People are generally impressed when I take off my clothes, but I don\u2019t get to that stage often.) I thought my personality was my silver lining, but unfortunately the more I talk to people on dating apps, the more I realize that\u2019s not appealing to them. I ask them questions about themselves, make jokes, and talk about my interests. I have plenty of friends, a prestigious job, and a dog whom I love. I go to therapy and actively try to improve myself. \n\nEvery boyfriend I\u2019ve had had told me I was the best girlfriend they\u2019d ever been with (including telling me this after we\u2019ve broken up), just apparently not good enough to stay with or not to cheat on.  \n\nAt this point, dating is making me feel worse about myself. I got out of a long term relationship last year, and the dating scene feels different than it did when I left it. I decided to take a break after a series of un-remarkable attempts, then came back to it this month. I\u2019ve had maybe 3 matches in a full month, all of which fizzled out before meeting in-person. Finding someone in-person doesn\u2019t seem feasible, as everyone I\u2019ve ever shown interest in first in the real world, beyond my awful college boyfriend, has not been reciprocated interest. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m realizing that this is a pattern and not a series of being with the wrong partners. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do. I don\u2019t want to inject my face full of fillers to become attractive (no judgment to those who do, but filler migration and absorption seem like a nightmare I\u2019d rather not have to deal with) or to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. Unfortunately, as I near 30, I\u2019m realizing that this means I will likely never get to have children, own a house, etc. That really kills me. \n\nAll of my friends are married or in committed relationships, and they just don\u2019t get it. \n\nWhat the hell are my options? Scroll apps occasionally and go on a date every few months? Get off them entirely again, and waste what\u2019s left of my youth?

She called me holding back tears, we spoke for about and hour, and then we both said goodbye.\n\nI will be honest, I don't miss her, and that's the most intriguing thing for me.\n\nI know that if I just try to speak with her on instagram, she will be happy to speak with me again. Probably really angry at first, but happy, at least. I know it, but I just don't even feel like it.\n\nShe was literally my perfect girl (I wrote my Ideal Girl Stereotype on my diary a few months ago), and even if she was a 20\/10, a girl that most guys would kill just to have a chance with, I wasn't interested at all, and now I'm not even sure if I really developed any feelings for her or not at the time.\n\n\u00bfCan somebody give me some kind of explanation? \u00bfSome psychological stuff or anything?\n\nI don't know why this happened to me, but I don't want this to happen again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, now, other stuff I think I should say, to add more context:\n\n\\-I'm a narcissist, a psychiatrist diagnosed me with that mental disorder, and I'm fighting with it since. I have a really strong ego, and a stronger character. (That was one of the things she liked).\n\n\\-I'm really outlandish, weird, Idk. Kinda autistic, cringe, as I said earlier. I like to feel and act with extreme confidence, like a character from a movie\/book. (She described me as a character written by a woman more than once).\n\n\\-The only thing I didn't liked about her, was that she didn't gave me all that much of her attention. We are both on self-improvement (Gym, reading, meditation, all of that) and we were really busy. But it was busy to a level that sometimes, she could pass a day without even seeing my texts.\n\n\\-One time, she confessed that sometimes she just ignored me because beign attentive was not in her nature, or she just \"didn't felt\" like answering my messages. (This actually angered me for a while, but even then, when I told her calmly about this she promised to speak more with me. She was awesome communicating, and I felt really understood).\n\n\\-I really thought that she just started to feel overwhelmed from me, or my way of beign, but she tried to mantain contact with me till the last minute.\n\n\\-It always has been difficult to me to fall in love with other girls (or even being attracted to them in a more deep, intimate way). I always had at least two girls that wanted me, but I just never felt like having a relationship, this was the only girl I could think as an exception.\n\n\\-I really think I was the problem, something with me beign wrong or anything. Be as harsh as you want, I will accept it. I need to know what to do in order to know my problem and how to fix it.\n\nI don't want this to happen in the future, I want to be able to heal this.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678653488.0},{"title":"how about fb dating?","author":"sherlock_huggy27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11pon3d\/how_about_fb_dating\/","text":"Hi I am starting to hate bumble atm.

Never learned a proper way to cope with my emotions, but never been in an actual relationship, so didn't even know I'm capable of doing... well, this.\n\nMet this guy and he was incredibly loving. He was open to hearing all of my problems, was understanding and knew change required patience. He also knew what he was going into, I made it clear. He offered help, and oh boy that's where it started...  Basically became my therapist and enabled emotional dumping. Fun.\n\nI did ask if it bothered him. No, he didn't mind, that's what relationships are for, he loved me so so much, he'd never leave me for that and believed we can both work together on my issues. So I believed him and did this more and more.\n\nAfter 3 months of dating, he suddenly decided we can't go on like that. He's exhausted. I understood but felt a little betrayed. I'd try to do it less and less, but found myself struggling with changing a newly ingrained \"pleasurable\" habit, and ADHD didn't help.  Moreover, our whole relationship depended on me stopping it immediately, which caused sooo much anxiety, things only turned worse and worse.\n\nHe's also stopped all the affection and intimacy, I saw the resentment growing. I tried so much, but it just wasn't enough. Did start meds and later therapy. He broke up with me anyway (amicably).\n\n**What I don't understand is, what was all the \"love\" and what he said before for? Did he not know it was bothering him earlier? Did he not know it would bother him from the beginning (he later said he's ran out of patience with exes before and didn't like people who constantly complained, thanks for letting me know that... at the end). Couldn't he just kindly set a boundary before he'd felt so drained? With my friends I know I shouldn't discuss certain things and it works.**\n\nI feel like I should predict everything, know better and it's totally my fault. Just with 0 relationship experience and him encouraging it, I seriously didn't think much of it at that time. Why couldn't I stop...............\n\nWhat hurts the most is the sudden change, downfall and feeling like we could've had something beautiful, but it was just cut short because... yeah.

He flirts with me a lot in text, and since I\u2019m pretty dense, I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s flirted in person, so I wouldn\u2019t know if he\u2019s tried that. Most of this sounds like the bare minimum, but stuff like this has never happened to me before coming from strict parents, so the most I\u2019ve gotten is one talking stage.\n\nHe had mentioned that right now he is too busy for a relationship. He sounded very disappointed as he explained his job and school are important to him and he wishes he had more time because he knows if he were to enter a relationship the other person would need a lot of dedicated time. With this being said, he has made time for me after my classes to pick me up and hang out for a few hours before he goes to work and I have to go back to class. I had mentioned that true, sometimes it can get busy, but if you really like someone you would go for it and do anything you could. He just told me I was right but.. and trailed off.\n\nA few friends had said maybe he has commitment issues, maybe he\u2019s waiting until he has some time, maybe he\u2019s scared I don\u2019t like him back, but that he definitely likes me. I\u2019m just not sure anymore considering I don\u2019t know how relationships work in Latin America.

I told her I didn\u2019t want to be set up, because I like meeting people more naturally (as in being friends first so it\u2019s not as awkward.) but she did it anyways, and I thought I would try. I felt uncomfortable in the beginning, but still thought I would try. I knew nothing about this person and the long texts \u201cgetting to know each other\u201d drained me. After about a day I called it off and rejected them. But now I feel awful about it. They were super sweet to me (asked me how I was, said good morning and goodnight, called me pet names) but I just couldn\u2019t do it. The pet names made me feel like I was in middle school. The, \u201chow was work, love?\u201d Gave me the ick. It felt so fake. I can\u2019t handle someone being so affectionate in the beginning stages of a relationship. And they said we could just start off as friends and take it slow! It felt like it was moving too fast. I thought I would feel better after rejecting them but I feel worse! I feel like I\u2019m the one who got rejected. And I\u2019m wondering if I made a huge mistake and should\u2019ve taken the time to get to know them better. One of the reasons I called it off too was I didn\u2019t wanna give up my freedom. They live in a different town and that means I would have to call\/FaceTime\/text every night. I\u2019m horrible at texting and hate talking on the phone. I like hanging out with people in person. But anyways, I feel like maybe I was being too logical about the whole thing. What if maybe I judged them too quickly and they were really a good person? And we would\u2019ve been a great match? I felt like they wouldn\u2019t understand me because we\u2019re super different, and they would find me weird once they really got to know me. I didn\u2019t think we would have anything in common. Also it was weird, because my coworker who set me up with them, had a relationship with that person at one point. They talk all the time and i didn\u2019t want my relationship with them to be reported back to my coworker all the time (which by the way I don\u2019t really match well with.) but now I feel like a loner loser who can\u2019t handle a relationship. I\u2019m so embarrassed because, of course, my coworker knows I rejected them. I feel like maybe I wasted a good opportunity. To quote Fiona Apple, I want love but I beg for people to leave me alone. Is there something wrong with me? I want a relationship with someone who has the same interests as me and can truly understand me, but I don\u2019t know if I will ever find that.

I was like \u201cok cool, I\u2019m fine with that and willing to wait but I do think it\u2019s an important part of a relationship that I need.\u201d And his response was \u201cdon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be taken care of in every way.\u201d\n\nIn those few weeks, we\u2019ve made out, cuddled, etc but haven\u2019t had sex. He asked me to sleep over the other day but I couldn\u2019t bc of school. And it just hasn\u2019t happened and he hasn\u2019t really tried to move things beyond kissing and cuddling. \n\nHe constantly tells me how attracted to me he is, but I\u2019m getting anxious about when it will happen and what him being demisexual means for me.

We were 6 months in & I brought up the conversation up of wanting to pursue dating & realized that there were many moments where it felt like we were a couple & that we were really becoming best friends, not to mention we have an insanely amazing sexual chemistry.\n\nI was so excited & have been so excited since I've discovered that we are on the same page. We've been friends for years & have always rooted for each other's happiness. Even though he admitted to always having a thing for me since we met(2020), I've recently realized that I truly can't see my life without him & have developed strong feelings for him these past 6 months. He is not only supportive & caring towards me but he is genuinely a nice, respectful, caring & mature man who brings out a side of me that I usually am too afraid to show other people. It sounds so cheesy to me but I really feel like I can be myself. We both shared how we feel so comfortable with each other & it is almost effortless when we spend time with each other. We catch up on each other's lives, watch movies, eat yummy food, & encourage one another on our mental health journeys...my time with him has literally felt like Im spending time with a best friend, just with all of the physical perks...& it truly has been the best sex I have ever had. Haha. He has always made me feel so comfortable & sexy in the bedroom all while prioritizing my pleasure.\n\nThings with him have been unraveling so beautifully in my opinion & we are both comfortable with seeing where this will go without adding on pressure of forcing it to work just because we physically have chemistry.\n\nBut how do I even date???\n\nWe are starting to get into the big dating conversations but I am also starting to realize that I have no idea of what healthy dating looks like...it's extremely scary to me.\n\nMy previous relationships consisted of love bombing, cheating & the dating portion of those relationships were so sped up just so I can be a girlfriend & fill a void in a man's life. Fast forward to now, this guy knows what he wants in life, has goals to buy a house & move out of state, & is bringing up some big topics in a way that is kind of laying all the cards on the table.\n\nOne of the main ones is that he is 9 years older than me. I see zero issues with this as I actually enjoy being with a man who isn't in that \"playing games\" phase of his life & is actively always working on improving himself through healthy outlets. The maturity in comparison to men my own age is so attractive. He mentioned that he already has some physical issues arising with his age & is balding. I understand that the older we get, the more we will slow down & looks & physical ability change over time..but ive always believed that the core of the person is what matters most. Outward appearances are just an added plus. But should this be a huge issue to consider? Are there success stories for having such an age gap?\n\nAnother thing he mentioned is that there is a possibility that he could be infertile. He's never gotten tested but based on a previous relationship, he never impregnated his ex even tho the amount of sex they had & lack of protection(with consent) surprised them both that they weren't getting pregnant. They weren't trying to but also weren't taking precautions to avoid it. I go back & forth with wanting children...I work with kids & am truly passionate about it so I am looking for ways to turn it into a career. There are days when I feel content with just working with kids & coming home to a dog & a loving partner. I also have experienced & seen so much abuse happen to children that it almost terrifies me to bring a precious baby into the world knowing they could possibly be exposed to its darkness that way. However, I do have moments where I can see myself enjoying motherhood & even with the way I've seen this guy treat kids, I can see him being a great dad. Is it something that should really be considered a deal breaker in my book if im not even sure about it yet? But there are also so many alternatives to getting pregnant that could this really be an issue?\n\nAnother thing to mention is that this guy has a handful of female friends. Over the years he's kept in contact with them in the same ways he did with me before we became FWB. As far as I know he hasn't dated them or had sexual experiences with them & he's actually told me a lot of the conversations he has with them. There are some friends he sees occasionally & one that he talks to frequently. He doesn't call any of them his best friends & also has a group of guy friends that he would consider best friends. With all that to say, I have experienced cheating in the past so I was used to viewing women as threats to my past relationships..sadly these came to pass & it brought a lot of trauma\/insecurity. But with this guy, because he was so open & honest about them before we even talked about dating & there was no reason to hide the truth, I don't feel as insecure about it as I used to years ago. The friend he talks to frequently knew about our FWB thing & was rooting for it. I don't really see these women as threats because I can see\/feel that what I have with him looks different from the friendships he has with them. Is this me maturing out of that \"cheated on trauma\" or is this me trying to convince myself that im okay with it? I do want to draw a line with it as far as him not giving the female friends the attention that he would give me as a person he's dating but other than that, I don't see an issue with it when I know the intention of these friendships & actually hear about their conversations in detail. Is there a way for a partner to have friends of the opposite sex in healthy ways?\n\nIf you have gotten this far, I greatly appreciate it. If there are any pointers, pieces of advice, words of wisdom, or experiences you can share with me, please do share as I have nobody to talk to this with & I do not want to go into this dating relationship so blindly.\n\nI have always desired to be in a healthy relationship where I am able to be myself without holding anything back but I am just so nervous to screw it up or put myself in a situation that will cause hurt.

I sent him an email about my needs and how I felt he didn\u2019t even bother replying. Every time he is home, he plays video games and go to sleep or just on his phone or the computer.

I'll say something that will make me sound conceited, but please, I'm here to explain what my problem is and seek help, I'm actually suffering, don't assume I'm here to brag:\n\nI'm considered a conventionally attractive man. And I have evidence of this. It all started when I was in high school and I was most girls' crush. After high school, I was the attractive dude in University. I get called handsome by men\/women regularly. When I go out, women check me out in public places, or even stare occasionally, sometimes I get hit on (by attractive women too) and so on. Okay, then what's the problem? Keep reading and I'll explain. I'll keep it as short as I can.\n\nThe problem is not that I find it hard to get women or sex. The problem is that sex is the least important thing to me, and because I don't value sex at all, I only value what a woman could offer me financially or emotionally. I meet a woman... she'll start giving me many hints... okay, good. But why should I take things further just because she's giving me hints? Keep in mind, I don't value sex. I won't be all over the moon just because a good-looking girls seems available. That's not even enough to make me want to talk to her. I need to be stimulated mentally: she could start by texting me  or calling me to make sure I'm good, calling me handsome to make me feel appreciated, buying me dinner, asking for a date.. or even sex.\n\n  I'm not saying that I expect this to happen or that this is a realistic scenario, but I'd basically be happy to switch the gender roles. Women do the work, men sit and wait and say yes or no. This is what would make me want to date women.\n\nNot making this up just for the narrative: last year I made friends with this group of  women, I was the only guy in this social circle. 3 of these women seemed to be attracted to me, one of them openly said ''I'm flirting with you''. We were having a good time. Out of nowhere, I completely abandoned these women. They literally begged me to come back, saying they were missing me so bad etc. but I didn't listen and I just cut them off and didn't look back. Why? I knew they were into me, I gave them some time to make a move, but they were just giving me all the opportunities to take things further. When I got bored, I threw them away.\n\nI have a very developed feminine side ( not saying I'm gay, I  wish I was gay) an, women like it, ironically.  I find it easy to form relationships with them, most women end up saying ''you're one in a million. You're handsome, you talk about anything, you don't pressure women into sex, you're classy when you talk.. even when you walk, you know how to dress. Most men instead don't work on any of these qualities and are very primitive''\n\nUnfortunately for them though, you can't have the cake and eat it too. With my very developed feminine side, comes the problem that I try to invert the gender roles. Yes, awesome, I have all these qualities... but who's gonna be the man now? You? If yes, I'm fine with that. I have decided I don't want to date women, but I'm getting frustrated and the lack of a dating life is making me bitter, but I can't change the way I'm wired. Even if I do meet one woman who is different, I kind of feel like I'm not really choosing her because I like her but because she's the only option I have and I don't like this.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678585521.0},{"title":"How to deal with inexperienced man?","author":"Ok_Inflation7399","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11pb60y\/how_to_deal_with_inexperienced_man\/","text":"He is 33yo and had only one relationship that ended 7 years ago.

Somehow her first message was a question to date, but we had to arrange the date a week later. Meanwhile we chatted a lot, at first initiated by her. (She wrote in her profile, that she's not a good texter, so I thought we would get to know each other on the date itself, but it seems like she wanted to chat meanwhile). \n\nHowever. It went pretty well until the day we should met. She wrote that she's at the hospital because she feel really sick and that she had to move the date. Of course I was ok with it. Later that day she wrote that she's back home because the doctors haven't found anything and that they think it's from  mental issues. From then she was constantly invalidating herself and said that I don't want to meet her because of that.\n\nI told her that this is not the case (I had mental issues myself, so I know what it's like) and that I still want to meet her. We chatted a few more days and I tried to arrange a new date. But she refuses because she want to become \"normal\" until we meet (her words). She then said that she don't want to waste my time because she doesn't know how long it takes and that I should look around. But she also would like to keep my number and message me when she's back \"normal\".\n\nI wished her the best and told her she can message me when she changed her mind. I considered it as done and everything fine. At the end of the day she wrote \"good night\" once again what I consider as kinda strange actually.\n\nHowever. A day later I started the app we met. Obviously none of us has unmatched and I saw that she's online. From there I see her online almost all day. \n\nI know this seems like she lied to me and just made an excuse to not meet. But I don't understand some behavior from her:\n\nWhy did she say that she want to message when she's \"normal\", when she's not interested? I mean she could just let it go. I assume a possibility is that she want to keep my number as a fallback. But actually this doesn't make any sense, because as a girl she would probably have enough matches, so that she doesn't need a fallback. Also why putting me into the friendzone without even meet?\n\nAlso if we assume her mental issues are not fictional, what I actually think, and that she really would like to meet when she's healed. Why would she constantly be online on this app then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this looks like she just lied to me so that she doesn't meet. I know I have to move on and I actually did, even though it doesn't seems like that. I'm not sure but I think even if she would message me again, I reject her or wouldn't answer. \n\nBut somehow I want to understand this.

I think those crazy crush feelings where you can't stop thinking about that person are actually connected with the feeling of being the reacher. i. e. the knowledge\/feeling of unattainability or (if already together) fear of loss. This actually creates a vicious circle in which the reacher becomes more and more emotionally attached to the point where the settler starts to distance himself more and more, causing the reacher to be confronted with the potentiality of loss, making his feelings become even stronger up to the point where it all ends, either on rational terms or exploding in a drama.\n\nIf you agree this type of vicious cycle exists, how would one make sure never to enter it in the first place, maybe even though one is aware there's a reacher-settler situation in a current relationship?","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678610361.0},{"title":"Trying to figure out what photo of me would be the best for a dating app, need advice.

As I got older, I feel like I'm not as optimistic as I was, compared to when I was in high school, now that I'm 23.\n\nI felt like when I was younger, those were the best days and years where you could really live your life, being young, where you could be in love and have as much fun as possible. And when I say fun, I don't mean sex. I'm talking about being with someone and having fun together, going out on dates and partaking in activities such as going to the movies, going to the beach, going out to eat, going to an arcade, etc. Unfortunately, I never had any luck when I was younger. \n\nBut now that I'm older, I've realized that there's no more time to have that kind of fun anymore, as now that I'm older, there's more responsibilities, and having fun comes second. Most people my age are already moving up in their lives, graduating from college, beginning their careers. Some of my closest friends have their life together, while I have yet to have my life together, as I still live at home, living off my parents, with no car of my own, and I'm still in school. \n\nPart of me wants to date. Part of me wants love & affection, physical touch, quality time, etc. Part of me misses having a crush on a girl, and all the feelings & emotions that come with having a crush: the butterflies, the burst of excitement seeing their name pop on your phone, hugging them, etc. (the list goes on). Part of me wants to share and express the love that I'm willing to give to somebody else. \n\nBut now that I'm older, and I'm 'falling behind in my life', another part of me wants to stop wanting to date, to stop trying to find love, accept being single (for the time being), and to not entertain my 'feelings'. I'm fully aware that I'm incapable of dating and being a good partner right now, since I don't have my life in order and have yet to have it fully figured out. I'm fully aware I'm incapable of handling the responsibilities that come with relationships. \n\nEven though I wanted to make it a goal of mine this year to step out of my comfort zone and approach girls, and possibly even go as far as going out on my first ever date. But being busy with everything going on right now, with school and other aspects of my life, I just knew this goal of mine was not the priority. I realized by the time I have everything sorted out in my life, I'll be too busy with my career to even go out on dates. Also considering how crazy the dating culture is nowadays, it helps with reminding me that I'm better off being single. \n\nI just wish I could stop wanting to date and stop being a hopeless romantic, but it's like a part of me doesn't want to call it quits, even though I really need to, despite the fact that I'm still fairly young.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678602537.0},{"title":"Opinions on the use of emojis?","author":"OutrageousLynx2367","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11oppn7\/opinions_on_the_use_of_emojis\/","text":"Im curious as to what the consensus is on if it\u2019s acceptable for men to use emojis.

It kinda sent me down a mental spiral and realized that she tried to date me back when we met, but I never jumped the gun cuz I was afraid of how she'll react and it just made me not want to think about college, but that's a whole different story. Anyways she said she'd marry me and she's just waiting on it at some point. But she doesn't want to date me cuz, well I'm passive and not too dominant with my social interactions. And it just reminded me why I always had a low self esteem in the first place. She said she only dates people she has no future with, meaning that it's just for fun I guess, and only marry people she's friends with. \n\nThe way I see dating is that it would be testing the waters of how compatible we would be as a couple.

His communication style between the dates is a little dry but that's fine, I know that texting isn't for everyone. We still text daily, simple stuff like how our days were so nothing excessive.\n\nWhen we are on dates, the conversation feels good,  but he also seems like the sort of unromantic type if I'm being honest. But my main issue is that he just doesn't seem to be on the ball about making plans anymore. He asked the other day what I had planned for Saturday (today), and suggested that we do something that day, but then also added that he'd have to make sure he wasn't doing anything with family (which I thought was weird because he's the one who asked if I was free in the first place). \n\nSaturday rolls around and I have to ask him if we have plans because he has not mentioned it, and he tells me that he's got plans with his cousin. All the while last weekend he planned a day in the city near us and did the works, art exhibit, fancy dinner, drinks, dessert. So it's like sometimes I feel like I'm getting high effort and other times nothing. \n\nWe had the talk already about not browsing on the dating apps anymore and wanting to continue developing what we've got.

Really new to this whole scene. I am trying to learn all the acronyms and phrases to catch up to living in a social media world. \n\nIt is a little intimidating to be honest. I feel completely lost about how to approach some one online. \n\nI hear these stories of women hating their DMs being invaded by thirsty guys sending dick pics. Definitely not my thing, but I am really hesitant to even send a DM to someone given the level of distrust of guys on here. \n\nI have been more of a lurker and comment type person but I thought I would take the plunge and create my own post and hope for the best. \n\nI am 51, 5\u201911, about 180 lbs and  consider myself athletic. I try to get to the gym three times a week. I consider myself an old fashioned guy. I believe in holding doors, paying for dates, being a gentleman first and foremost. \n\nEven so, I suck at reading intentions behind words and emojis. Is a reply with one emoji sort of like a \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d type of reply. \n\nAnyway, if anyone would like to chat with me and just be a friend, I am happy to talk to anyone. \n\nBeing an older guy on here and most dating sites feels like being behind the 8 ball. Too creepy for younger ladies. Too annoying to anyone else. If I get replies, it is usually a referral to a person\u2019s only fans. \n\n Not that I mind supporting a creator but I am hoping for more than just being a paying customer or fan. \n\nIt gets lonely in the real world being an older, divorced guy.

We were already fairly close friends before started dating. I was diagnosed with bipolar since quite young and he knew and accepted this since the beginning.\n\n**Issue:**\n\nSince we first knew each other, for a long while, I've been holding myself quite well, and the traits of my mental issue when I 'hold myself well' can be easily perceived as just slightly eccentric (and even endearing sometimes - based on many people around me) personality.\n\nBut then I hit a major rough patch in my life now and can't continue to hold myself anymore. I'm very bad at communicating myself when I don't feel well. So since the beginning of this year, I've been quite nasty to him any time we communicate. Think about having extreme mood swings, being borderline verbally abusive (we're both in arts, often collaborate, so by being verbally abusive I mainly mean me trashing his works and work ethics for no legit reason) and saying childish and annoying things like I'm a dickhead, he hates me, he doesn't love me and we should cut contact. He's still with me now despite that. Constantly reassuring me that I'm not an ahole and he loves me etc. But I can feel that he's also quite hurt now and gradually losing it.\n\nNow after a while my situation has become better. My mental status has also improved as a result of this, and after intensive therapy sessions. So I reached out to reconcile a bit this week. I did two things so far:\n\nI'm an avid baker and he loves almost everything I bake. In my rough patch I haven't treated him to them at all. So I baked a very lovely looking cake, sent him a photo of it, asking how much he wants. He responded saying maybe a little, and I'm always so nice to him. Added in the end for no reason that we 'get along so well' and he values me a lot.\n\nLater when I felt my mind is clear enough, I sent him an email (not short, but not so long that it's annoying) explained what's going on in my head these days, expressed that I'm sorry and I knew I've been awful to him as of late, I'll try to deal with this kind of issues better in the future, he just need to be there with me. He hasn't responded yet. I'm also not sure he will respond, because it's indeed an awkward thing to respond to, and he's generally very non-confrontational...\n\nMight try to go and visit him on the basis of giving him cake soon, though unsure when exactly because both sides are really busy and under big pressure (one reason I feel very guilty to not handle my situation better) these days.\n\n**My question:**\n\nIs there anything else I can do to continue to reconcile at the same time?

To be honest, I\u2019ve never really thought about her that way, but I have always thought she was kinda cute, lol.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, my parents have always joked about how much they want me and her to date because they like her and think we\u2019d be a good match, so I\u2019m likely being somewhat encouraged by that. More-so, my sister really likes her as a friend, and has always just thought she was a good person, and I have as well. My sister and I are pretty close, and after actually showing her the profile because one of her prompts was funny, she even said, she wouldn\u2019t care, even though I didn\u2019t even hint I was thinking about liking her.\n\nThere is a prompt on her profile that asks about the name of a group chat, and I know the name of it because my sister has told me, so could make a good joke about it.

I\u2019m just worried about how it could make my sister feel. I just don\u2019t want dating to potentially end with her friend, affecting their relationship, I care too much about my sister to want to jeopardize that friendship for her. I like to think I\u2019m a pretty good guy, so I would never mistreat her friend in any way, and I know my sister knows that. I know it\u2019s stupid to think about any of this because nothing has happened, but I care about my sister too much to not even consider it. Let me also say, I don\u2019t subscribe to the idea that if my friend wanted to date my sister, he couldn\u2019t because of the \u201cbro code\u201d bs.

This is going to be a long one so I apologize in advance. Also, English is not my mother tongue so there might be some mistakes.\n\nI'm a woman in mid-thirties and I've been living alone for the last 10 years. I've got a good job, make decent amount of money and I'm physically healthy. However, I'm very introverted and I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in 2012. I've had it under control for quite some time but it came back in 2020 just before the start of the covid pandemic. The last three years have been extremely difficult for me because of lockdowns and other stuff that's been going on around me. I was depressed most of the time and I tried to be more physically active and do stuff but the problem was I never really figured out the root cause of my anxiety and depression at the start of 2020, especially because the previous year was quite a happy one for me.\n\nAnyway, the only relationship I've had in the last 10 years was a long distance one and it lasted for six years, but in 2022 I decided it was time to break up because it wasn't going anywhere and because I met someone else. However, we still talk regularly as friends. He isn't the reason I'm looking for advice though. \n\nThe reason is the guy I met just over a year ago. I was going through an extremely anxious period, but when I met him, my anxiety disappeared like magic. I wasn't aware falling in love was the reason, but everyone around me noticed my mood suddenly improved and I was more talkative than usually. It took about two weeks for me to realize I fell in love and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. It felt completely silly, like being a 15-year-old again. Due to circumstances, I had no idea when I would see him again, but it all worked out and I saw him over a month later. That's when I knew I was completely smitten with him. I felt like I've known him since forever, his presence simply felt natural. I didn't want him to leave, I just wanted to talk to him all day. I have never experienced anything similar with anyone I've ever met. I knew it was different this time. We\u2019ve seen each other a couple of times and we talked enough for me to know I wanted to be with him again and again. So, I decided to ask him out never even thinking he would say no, especially because I knew he was quite unhappy being single. We\u2019re the same age and with similar interests. But unlike me, he still lives with his mom and, truth be told, he hasn\u2019t accomplished much in life. He has a job that he hates, he\u2019s extremely insecure and from what I\u2019ve gathered, nervous around women. He gave me his number eventually and I sent him a message trying to chat about going out for a drink. I never got a reply. Next time I saw him, I asked him about it but he lied and said he never got my message (which was virtually impossible). Anyway, he refused to go out with me, but wouldn\u2019t tell me why. To this day I have no idea why he said no to us just getting a drink and talking in private, that\u2019s it. All his answers were quite cryptic, and all I could conclude was that he was betrayed a couple of times by people he trusted, so he started isolating himself and avoiding attachments. You could never tell that because he\u2019s talkative, kind and charming. It\u2019s easy to fall in love with him. He actually has many admirable qualities but he so damn insecure and can\u2019t say no to two people who seem to control his life - his divorced parents, especially his mom. He\u2019s so devoted to them he said he can\u2019t handle a third person (?). Which is funny, because he said to someone close to me that he wished he had a girlfriend.\n\nAfter some time, we talked on the phone for different reasons and later that day I sent him another message with a joke, nothing harmful or pushy or anything like that. But he blocked my number. I was devastated, and I knew that was the end of the story we never even had. The last time I saw him was 9 months ago, and he blocked me 6 months ago. I thought I would forget him by the end of summer. It didn\u2019t happen. Then I thought it might be by the end of fall. Nope. Then there was winter and now it\u2019s spring again. I am still in love. And it hurts so much. I\u2019ve been so mad at him for what he did, it was so immature and childish. There were days when I thought I had finally forgotten him but then it would all come back, I would start smiling again simply because he exists.\n\nHere's the thing. I never knew a guy like him would be someone I would consider to be \u201cthe one\u201d. He isn\u2019t someone I would say is my type. But that\u2019s how things work, right? When you least expect it, something or someone turns your life upside down. I never thought about marriage or having kids my entire life except on a couple of occasions. It wasn\u2019t important to me at all. Until I met him. For the first time in my life, I feel like I\u2019m ready to have my own family. And it\u2019s because of him. I am fully aware that he might not be marriage material at all, but I can\u2019t help this feeling I\u2019ve had since the first time we talked. It hasn\u2019t faded even after he blocked me clearly not wanting to have anything with me. But the problem is it\u2019s killing me, I\u2019m sad, frustrated and depressed. I miss him so much. I know this state isn\u2019t healthy for me at all. I want to forget him but wherever I go, whatever I do, I keep thinking about him, I want him to be there with me. I stopped doing activities that he likes doing because it reminds me of him. Even the little things trigger me because it\u2019s something that reminds me of him. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t look for happiness in other people. But I can\u2019t find it in myself either. And if true happiness is inside us, why do people look for soulmates? Why isn\u2019t everyone happy alone? I was happy when I was spending time with him, now I\u2019m lonely and sad. I just can\u2019t imagine anyone else except him. I know with time it should get better. But what do I do now? How do I go on from this? How do I forget? The feeling is still intense, and if him blocking me didn\u2019t help, then what will? There were times when I thought I did something wrong, but I keep reminding myself I did everything right. I know my qualities. It\u2019s his loss, not mine. Despite this attitude, I\u2019d be the happiest person in the world if he would contact me and apologize for blocking me.

I\u2019m a guy who is very cautious who I date (I\u2019m divorced and been burned badly) and don\u2019t even consider getting into a relationship very easily. I know what I have to offer and what I need so I\u2019d rather be single than in a bad relationship.\n\nRecently I finally was ready to take the leap. I\u2019d been seeing this woman (25F) with a kid for a few months. We live an hour away and she has her kid every other week so seeing each other was great, but not super often. Like 1-2 times a week. We connected so well in person, and I loved our calls whenever she was able to answer, and we texted all the time.\n\nEarly on we really hit it off and she started talking hypothetical future situations and making plans and I found myself buying in. And after each date she would always say how much she loved it and loved creating these new memories with me. She had said she was a good communicator, and it seemed that way. She reassured me when I needed it, and we could always talk about things in life we disagreed about in a healthy way. Things were going so well.\n\nOne thing that was difficult was that she would say that she wanted to date me, but didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship yet. And I thought it made sense due to her past and not knowing each other for super long so I understood, but it did make me feel a little anxious sometimes since she did it in a way that was a little hot and cold (\u201cI really like you and I just bought tickets for us to go to a concert in July\u201d, \u201cI think we need more time to get to know each other\u201d, etc.). But I was ok taking it slow because I trusted her and wasn\u2019t trying to rush things either. \n\nThen last weekend shit hit the fan. We had been planning on her coming down on Saturday and going to a play we\u2019ve been planning on for a month, and spending the weekend. On Friday night she went out with a friend who just got cheated on. We had texted about her sending me funny drunk texts and texting back and forth a bit, and I also told her to be supportive of her friend. Well she occasionally sent me some pictures and I would respond and flirt (usually within 45 minutes) and ask how it was going to check on her, but she would respond in like 30 minutes with another picture but without responding to my actual texts. I ended up falling asleep at 11:15 and she got super mad and at 2 am said she hated when I did that, \u201cwhat if something had happened tonight\u201d, and said we needed to postpone the weekend date. I told her the next day I was sorry and didn\u2019t realize that she expected me to stay up talking to her but that I\u2019d be more than happy to next time now that I know (she only goes out like 3-4 times a year).\n\nOn Saturday\/Sunday there was minimal interaction. On Monday she called and we talked and she said she understood me and that she missed me and was embarrassed by how she reacted. Then after the call she texted and said she missed me and said she could come down this weekend. I felt things were better. Then Tuesday morning she texted me good morning, called me babe, and said she was thinking of me. I responded and said I was too and asked how her day went. She said it was the anniversary of one of her friends deaths and that she was super anxious. So I asked what I could do and if she wanted to talk and she said maybe a call later. After work I went to see Creed and texted her to say we needed to go together, and all she said was \u201cyeah\u201d. Then I tried calling her and she sent it to voicemail after 2 rings. I texted her saying I called her to check in that I was thinking about her, and said to call me back when she could. All she did was like the message and I never heard back.\n\nThis kind of communication is a dealbreaker since I need to be with someone who can communicate and work through unintentional miscommunication and pain that happens. Looking back I can\u2019t really see any red flags to avoid this, but it\u2019s so frustrating because a small part of me keeps saying that maybe I could have done something better and that this past week was just a one time bad communication (I know it\u2019s not) and I keep reliving the conversations and also looking at the lost plans we had made and get sad. I obviously don\u2019t want to be in a relationship like this and I never will be, but my old anxious attachment is coming out and I\u2019m just frustrated at myself for it. I feel like I wasted so much time and energy only to be completely lied to, and it makes me feel like a horrible judge of character. Has anyone else been there and have any advice?\n\n\nTL;DR Great potential with this woman and dated for some months. She got upset I didn\u2019t stay up texting her all night when she was out drinking with her friend. Ended up apologizing and calling me babe again, making plans, only to then ghost me.

I tried out a few different dating apps recently, went on about 20-30 dates in the last 4-5 months. Costly if you add it all up but I did enjoy the experience of human interaction. \n\nI noticed when I first got on Hinge, I felt like a celebrity. I had many women within the first few days actively pursuing me. It was fantastic and I thought the right one was just around the corner.\n\nFast forward to today, it\u2019s like everything went stagnant. Now every week is lucky if I get one response to a conversation that I initiated. \n\nI have multiple accounts on multiple platforms now, and noticed so many of the women are all on the same 5 or so apps. They all sucker you into paying to see who likes you, and instantly regret finding out that 97 of the 99 women that do are in other countries. \n\nI\u2019m wondering what changed in just a few months? Is it something where they automatically boost newbies? Where the planets just aligned? I look exactly the same as 6 months ago lol. \n\nI\u2019m starting to get a complex now like that was it and I fucked up. I definitely shouldn\u2019t have dated that soon after my separation because I wasn\u2019t ready. There were several pretty women that would have been great companions but I wanted to keep looking for a better one.\n\nNow I\u2019ve been \u201clowering my standards\u201d which sounds awful but just in terms of making even more compromises that directly turn me off just for the sake of not being alone any longer.\n\nMost people\u2019s advice is \u201cyou have to be happy with yourself\u201d, \u201cuse this time to work on yourself\u201d, \u201conly you are responsible for your happiness \u201c. This is all cookie cutter advice and not helpful so please don\u2019t tell someone that confides in you any of these cliches. If you want to help, be a buddy and try to set him up with one of your wife\u2019s friends. That\u2019s a true friend because words mean nothing.\n\nMy apologies for the digression, back to the meat\u2026 these apps do work. They do require some money but it\u2019s a small price to pay for love right? My deal is that I\u2019m not getting younger and I know there\u2019s perfect matches out there for me but making the meeting happen is what has become the roadblock.\n\nI set my preferences for mid 20s to mid 30s (I\u2019m 44). This age thing has not been an issue for me fortunately. I still look young enough for hopefully another couple years. I also selected \u201cno children\u201d because of two reasons. It\u2019s hard enough for these women that I\u2019ve chatted with to commit to a date because of work schedules and other dates scheduled before you, to throw a major responsibility into the mix is just pen pals forever zone.\n\nI have also noticed that a vast majority of the women on these apps are all solicitors for their social media and are using it as free advertisement for followers. Please report them. It\u2019s a waste of time and limited likes, matches, roses, etc. \n\nI spent about 6 hours one weekend just reporting ladies promoting their OF, insta, and snap.

I am his first girlfriend, first love, first sexual relationship, etc. He used to be a player, and had a bad reputation. No one thought him like he is with me. \n\nNormally he is easygoing, really comfortable with girls, and really friendly. \nWith me, he is really shy, and is really bad at flirting lol. But I find it cute. \n\nHe started really fast with our relationship. He took me to dinner for our first month, I met his mother and his close friends. He told me he loved me at our first month, and talked about a future with me. \nIt kinda scared me because I thought he was love bombing me, but I think it is because no one ever treated me like that. I had  two relationships before, but they never really cared about me. On the other hand, he takes care of me, takes me on a lot of dates, and tries to spend as much time with me as he can. When he isn\u2019t when his friends or studying , he tries to see me. \nIf he could he would see me everyday, but I personally don\u2019t need to see him more than 1-2 times a week. So we see each other 4 times a week. He almost always initiates and organizes our dates. \n\nI thought that first relationships for guys were abusive, but he really treats me like a queen. \n\nBut last week, he moved cities, because he was changing schools. I don\u2019t know why, but he was really anxious and therefore more irritable. \nSo one time he picked up a fight with me because I didn\u2019t answer his text for two hours because I was with my family. He told me I didn\u2019t put effort in the relationship and we argued for 3 hours. \nNext day he apologized and told me he didn\u2019t have to react like that. He corrected his mistakes and doesn\u2019t ever bother me when i don\u2019t answer his texts. But still, I feel stressed when i\u2019m busy and i can\u2019t answer him because of his past mistake. \n\nTwo days later he misunderstood what I said to him and we argued again, and he said the same things to me. \nHe really apologized again and asked me later that day to tell me if i would like to change things in our relationship so I could feel better. I told him that nothing had to be changed. \n\nHe then left me more space since that two incidents and reassures me that I shouldn\u2019t be apologizing when i can\u2019t answer and that he made a mistake. \n\nHe has never been mean but he made me cry that two times. I now can\u2019t see him the same and I\u2019m worried about a future with him. \n\nAre his mistakes red flags ?

She asked if that was the best one I had, I told her a better one and she laughed a bit more. We talked a bit more and found out that we were both in not only the same program but also in one of the same classes which was just the biggest coincidence I found myself in. I tagged along with her and her friends for the rest of the night until she went home. We left each other on good terms. \n\nOver the next couple weeks we soon got to talking more often with each other through text mostly because we exchanged numbers. We also talked with each other during our shared class, but the class started at 8am and she was often too tired to talk. The only times I ever spoke with her outside of this class were when we first met at the bar and at a library where I set up a study meet up a few weeks ago. \n\nDuring this meet up we talked about a lot of things from movies\/shows we liked to stuff about our pasts to our current classes and future plans. \n\nNow, a midterm exam for our class happened last week and I wanted to organize another study meetup to discuss it. I proposed it to her over text, but she said she had a friend\u2019s birthday party she planned on going to. I told her I understood that and shared her a quizlet study set I created anyway. \n\nNow, over time, I found out that we most often talk about classwork through text. Most attempts by me to talk about something else wind up with me getting ghosted. For example, I asked how the birthday party was going and she ghosted me. (Side note: would calling her be good or would using insta messaging be better than just texting?)\n\nThis makes me concerned that she might only see me as a class resource or unofficial partner for her and any other attempts to talk more about different non-school subjects through text have been met with ghosting. If that\u2019s truly the case, I think it might tear me apart inside. However, because of this resource status, I\u2019m hoping I can use this relationship to my advantage as an excuse to talk to her more. Hopefully more in person. Maybe she\u2019ll get to see me in a more trusting and fun light and focus on me more than just my classes. \n\nThe resource\/partner thing is only one problem though. The other major problem lies in her future and us going our separate ways once we both graduate in a couple months. I\u2019ll move down south while she wants to move to New York. From what I\u2019ve learned from others, long distance never works out.\n\nI think maybe this relationship may ultimately be doomed to fail, but I\u2019m still willing to see where it goes, and progresses into, for the sake of my love and social lives.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678549267.0},{"title":"National Blow Job Day","author":"Stifflersmom247","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11os20g\/national_blow_job_day\/","text":"I\u2019ve been reading all the comments about National BJ day, and somehow it always ends up leading to \u201cmen are pigs\u201d or some other negative out look toward men.

It sucks, man. And you know what's worse? The odds are stacked against guys on these dating apps, 'cause there are way more dudes than chicks. So, to see how bad it was, I made a new profile as a chick myself, using a wig and filters to look the part. And holy cow, I got more than 99 likes in just a few hours! But don't be too jealous, 'cause most of the guys I talked to were boring and just looking to hook up. Yawn. So, I deleted that profile real fast. Honestly, it's a total bummer that girls have to deal with that kind of nonsense. And I feel sorry for the decent dudes out there who get lumped in with those douchebags. My advice?

This happened about 3 months ago.\n\nI was at a party with a bunch of my friends and having a great time as you do at parties. I got too drunk so I left earlier than everyone else, probably around like 2:30 or 3:00. Anyway, I always get super horny when I'm drunk so I wanted to go see my boyfriend. He had to work late so he wasn't at the party.The party was at someone's house wasn't a far walk and I kind of stumbled my way there I guess. \n\nThe problem happened when I got to his dorm building but accidentally went to the wrong floor apparently. I'm sure you can see where this is going so cutting to the chase, I fucked this random guy who was certainly not my boyfriend while thinking it was.\n\nI don't remember a ton of it honestly. I remember walking in as he was waking up and him being like \"What the hell?\" but I just kinda laughed and fell down on him and mumbled something about him knowing how horny I get after drinking and saying he missed a great party and gave him a kiss.\n\nIt sounded like he was about to say something, but I think I cut him off when I started trying to get under the covers and also starting to take my clothes off. \nI haven't been asking my boyfriend to wear condoms lately, so when he asked I just like giggle and was like \"Uh no\" and I think that really turned him on. I'm pretty sure we did missionary, doggy, and I rode him and he came inside me at least once. We also did oral on each other but I probably didn't do a great job. I don't really remember. Time was hard to keep track of but we had to have fucked like all night.\n\nThe revelation the next morning was not ideal and I kind of freaked out a little and he was obviously apologetic and probably was worried I would say he raped me or something. I felt horrible but I also couldn't shake the feeling of how hot it was about how that went down. I have not told my boyfriend this happened and I haven't seen this guy since.

I met someone (female, around the same age as me) pretty recently through one of the usual dating apps you tend to see, and we have been clicking more than what I'm used to in a relationship, especially this early on. She is very sweet and nice to me, which I'm not used to early on in a relationship (it's been about a week since we met, for context, and we have been on a couple dates).\n\nNow nothing has been a real \"red flag\" like her saying the \"L word\" or anything like that (other than saying that she \"loved\" the date activity or whatever, not at me directly), but I'm afraid that the situation is too good to be true. Like, she consistently compliments me in ways I'm not used to, and I did tell her it takes me a while to match that energy, and she respects that boundary and my need to catch up and take things a little slower. I'm not convinced she's a \"love bomber\" as it stands.\n\nI also understand that affection is shown in different ways by different people and I may just be blowing this way out of proportion. My prior relationship luck is very, VERY hit or miss, so it may just be that I'm not used to all of this. Very possible that I'm not seeing straight.\n\nShe says a lot of really dreamy stuff (not going to lie, a lot of which I do reciprocate, I'm a rather sentimental guy myself) and I have been flat-out honest about some of it being hard for me to process so early, and she says she doesn't want me to feel pressured and has apologized if she feels like she's overwhelmed me and respects my desire to get to know her more deeply before things get too real.\n\nFor clarity; when I mean \"dreamy stuff\" being said I mean like she says things about how I've got such a great personality or that I'm just the kind of guy she's hoped for, and so on.

All year this has happened, fuck man this has happened to me forever. I always either get friend zoned or straight ghosted. A few months ago this girl I took out bowling just straight ghosted me, we had a real good time, nothing indicated that she was having a bad time, and when I walked her back to her building I got a hug and then I never heard from her. I was wondering wtf I did wrong and what was wrong with me for like 2 months, and I eventually couldn't take it anymore so I went against myself and texted her asking why she ghosted me. She responded and said I didn't know it was a date, and rather than letting me know she just decided it was better to ghost me without a word or any indication there was something wrong. She basically told me it was because she just didn't know how to respond to it. So I texted her back saying it's cool and we had good convo afterwards, and that was that. Now everytime I see her she gives this awkward uncomfortable ass smile, and it's just painful to see her because it's so awkward. Another girl I met at a school party, my homies and her homegirls went clubbing with us and we had a great time, and finished the night at iHop, and then a few days later I take her out for a boba date, I'm thinking everything's going great until we get back to our building and she just stops me and says \"I just want to be friends, I've never dated anyone before\" And there's that. And most recently I was interested in one of my homegirl's friends, and my homegirl called me and told me her friend was into me, like mad into me, so I worked up the courage to go up to her at the gym(I fucking work at the gym too so I'm a dumb fuck) and she makes up a lie that she has a boyfriend, and rejects the fuck out of me. Basically my homegirl set me up to look like a complete clown, and she says she didn't know but I don't know, that was a huge blow to my self esteem. I can never get past the talking phase, and it's fucked me up. I see all my homie's with their girls and I can never get this out of my head, \"What is wrong with me? What's so terrible about me? Why am I such a piece of shit loser bastard?\" I'm a decent looking guy, I recently had a fuckton of acne so that doesn't help, and I got a slight gut but I'm somewhat built. I just wish I knew what about me is so fucking terrible so I could fix it. This whole thing has fucked me up, I recently went on antidepressants. All my homies in relationships say \"You'll find love when you least expect it\" or sum shit like that, but fuck man, I haven't had a relationship since middle school, I don't know how to be happy when the whole opposite sex sees me as a clown and undesirable, I'm in college this is the best time to find relationships and I can't find one.

When we come home, I embrace her and kiss her, ask how her day is, we make food, we bake croissants, we talk about art, philosophy, films, current events, we sit and eat, package some leftover for lunch on Monday, we clean up. She head to the living room, she sit on the couch, I prepare some junk food and hot drinks, bringing it over, we cuddle, we kiss, we snack, we watch Netflix, films, anime, whatever ticks our fancy. In the weekend on a lovely sunny morning, we take walks at a park, holding hands, we talk, we heal, we reminisce, we joke. We visit cafe and restaurants we never been to, enjoy some quality time together. In the afternoon, we play video games together, resume building that mansion we designed together in Minecraft, listen to music together, we sing, we dance, we drink, we laugh. When we head to bed, we cuddle, and we discuss our deepest and most innermost thoughts and we comfort each other with positive thinking and words of affirmation, we fall asleep in each other's arms.\n\nThat is, if Candice really existed, Candice is just an example of my imagination of what I want out of a romantic dating life. Recently, I had an epiphany, I realised what I want is a reflection of how empty and boring I am, there's no substance to my soul, no magnificence to my ambitions. I desire nothing of extravagance or glamour, what I want is simple, to be loved, and to have plenty of reasons and opportunities to love. And I feel this reveals more of my own flawed character, that is, I'm too childish, perhaps I have age regressed. Perhaps what I want is too unrealistic and I set up myself up for disappointment. A partner is someone who want their own things and I don't even begin to prepare for it.

After talking for a few days or so I get a little more direct with her and ask her what her intentions were with adding and Dming me and she said she was \"just checking in\". I replied letting her know I always found her attractive and wanted to keep it 100 so nothing was misunderstood as I am not for this whole \"friendzone\" thing. Then she went silent on me which I said I know I come off as pretty forward which she responded with \"its ok, I am just not interested in dating\".

I was very close with a girl that lived close by for many years however we never officially dated and we eventually drifted apart for reasons that aren't important to the post. The point is that a lot of YouTube videos and general advice on dating boils down to ''don't focus on dating at all just focus on developing yourself'.'' Which I admit isn't bad advice it's never a bad thing to work on yourself however I've been working on myself for the past 22 years shouldn't there be some payoff eventually? I get I am still young in the grand scheme of things but there are plenty of people that have done less in life and aren't as developed that succeed in relationships.\n\nI guess the main point I'm trying to make is that it's hard not to focus on relationships when that is the only aspect of my life that is a complete mess. My mental health and confidence in myself is great. I've always had the mentality that if I try my hardest to accomplish something it will eventually happen. While I'm certainly not the biggest or strongest guy out there my psychical heath is great as well. I play basketball and skateboard all the time. I've always made an effort to stay active and in shape. Finically I am doing good as well. I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination however I am doing much better than the average 22 year old. I am also one year away from graduating college and thanks to my smart choices such as going to community and then a local university I've managed to avoid crazy ass student loans. So with everything else in my life going great it can be very hard not to focus in on my fucked up and nonexistent dating life. I'm just not sure how to go about it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678486650.0},{"title":"Am I in the wrong for asking a male friend for help?","author":"Anonymous7199","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11o2jte\/am_i_in_the_wrong_for_asking_a_male_friend_for\/","text":"I (19F) have been dating (19M) for 9 months. We live\ntogether at his parent's house.\n\nI freelance act and model when I have free time outside\nof college. For fun, I do stand-up comedy at a few\nvenues throughout our region\/county.\n\nThrough stand-up, I've made a lot of friends. I'm not\ntight-knit with them or anything, but we bond over it a lot\nand sometimes go out for pizza after shows.\n\nOne guy in particular (M41) hosts his own comedy show\nthat I perform at every two weeks. He gives me a lot of\nfeedback on my material and has helped me learn how to\nhost my own show. He also films short skits online for\nfun. He has a great camera setup too. He is single and\nhas no children.\n\nMy boyfriend (19M) is incredibly jealous whenever he\n(M41) communicates with me. My boyfriend hardly\nwants him around me and I've had to practically beg him\nnot to make a scene or be disrespectful to him at our\nshows. I've explained many times that I'm not interested\nin him, and that I love the man I chose. My boyfriend\nthinks he is flirting with me or wants to be intimate, but\n(M41) has this excited flirty jokey personality and acts\nthe same way with everyone. I've tried explaining this to\nmy boyfriend, but he still doesn't like it.\n\n\nI've booked two auditions for short films. They have to be\nself-taped at home. (M41) lives alone and has many\nspaces to film these tapes. He has acting experience and\ncould be the reader (Other person I need to interact with in the script) for the scenes.\n\nBefore even contacting (M41) to ask for his help, I told\nmy boyfriend that I was going to ask for his help, and I\ntold him that he could come watch because he doesn't\nwant me alone with this other guy. My boyfriend offered\nto be the reader for me, but I explained to him that he\nisn't a strong public speaker (I often have difficulty\nhearing him), and that he doesn't have acting experience.\nI also explained that (M41) knows how to film properly,\nand that there are clips that would need one of his\ntripods or something. He was still upset and tried to\nmake any possible alternative to asking him; promising\nto perfectly memorize the lines, speaking clearly, etc. I\ntold him that these auditions are important to me, and\nthey need to be the best quality they can be. I promised\nhim that he can be there to supervise. He felt better, and\ntold me I have to let him know as soon as I find out\nschedules and that it has to work out so that he can be\nthere.\n\nToday, I got a response from (M41). He is going to help\nme with the scenes. Unfortunately, I found out that the\naudition tapes are due on March 12th. (M41) is still able\nto help, but after talking to my boyfriend, there isn't a\ntime that works to film that would allow my boyfriend to\nbe there. I asked (M41) if tonight would work, so that I\ncould have my boyfriend there (I didn't mention that it\nwas because of my boyfriend). Unfortunately it didn't\nwork for (M41). I explained to my boyfriend that we will\nhave to film tomorrow. He said \"I don't care what the\ncircumstances are, I don't want you hanging out with ___ alone\". I keep trying to reassure him that\neverything is going to be strictly platonic, and that this is\nimportant for my acting career. He just keeps saying\n\"You're not going\" and that I messed up and that I'm\nmaking him worry which is affecting him at work.\n\nI personally feel like I shouldn't allow his jealousy make\nme miss opportunities in my acting career.\n\nTLDR: I have to film audition tapes and I seeked out a\nmale friend to help me with it. My boyfriend is extremely\nupset, and is demanding that I don't do it.

This wonderful person who is now my ex took it upon herself to ask me on a date to which at first I politely declined as I was nervous and didn't want to date where I was working. Fast forward a few weeks and she was leaving the job so a date ended up happening. \n\nShe was wonderful, I was going to see her at every chance I could doing whatever I needed to to see her. \n\nAfter about 2 short months of dating she was getting thrown out of her apartment which (we moved too quickly) but we took it as an opportunity to move in together. \n\nAt this job I was working insane hours but things went really well for the first 7ish months. I was getting worn out though. I started complaining about needing help around the house to keep it clean\/ do laundry\/ help cook or get food\/ take care of the pets. I also tried to help her get her finances in order. All of this was taken as \"parenting\" from me. I really cared about this person and wanted a life with them despite what I thought to be poor choices on their part. \n\nIn the middle of the relationship, maybe 8 months in I told her I wasn't sure I could do it anymore and told her that we should consider breaking up. We stayed together regardless but I don't know why... I think part of me thought she would help me more and part of me didn't want to feel like I made her homeless.\n\nAs for myself I know I am emotionally unintelligent. I sometimes would shut down if we would argue and wouldn't want to speak about the issues right after they happened. I know I gave out \"tough-love\" as advice sometimes as well - when I probably should have held my tongue. When she brought these issues up to me I tried so hard to fix them while I felt as though they ignored what I asked of them. I started working on my flaws too late...\n\nI really tried to do everything I could for her. I paid all the bills, got her a car, did all the chores and tried to work on being there for her with whatever she needed.\n\nI was in no way perfect and our relationship was set up to fail I feel like. It's been a couple months since we have been done but I still think about her all the time. I really miss her and although I don't think we would ever date again, I care about her well-being and worry about her. \n\nShe told me she never wants to see me again though and I've never been more hurt. \n\nDo you think there is any salvaging this as in becoming friendly?

He asked me out, as an adult does, but I have to admit, it was refreshing to be asked out on a date and not just \"Wanna come over and hang out?\" Unfortunately, he had a work thing come up. Then we re-scheduled for last Friday, and sure enough, I came down with Covid. So, we re-scheduled yet again....and here we are. \n\nHe's been great. Completely understanding and easy. \n\nWhich brings us back to last weekend. He called me during his drive between jobs for work. We chatted on the phone, then he got to a worksite, and he asked me to call him at a particular time. I had company so I called maybe 10 or 15 minutes late, no answer, left a voicemail. \n\nHe texted me a response to his voicemail, I replied.....and then I didn't hear anything. Like I said, I had company, so I was mostly occupied. Figured he was busy with work, as he told me recent wind storms have kept him busy. Then, Monday comes, and I still haven't heard from him. So, I texted, \"Are we still on for Friday?\" And, I don't hear from him for the longest time, figured I was ghosted.\n\nI eventually get a response that he would like to go out, but \"for context\" he met someone over the weekend, and he just thought I should know. \n\nNow, I presumed he was multi-dating, as I am (or at least trying) , so I wasn't particularly shocked. Or bothered. But, I will say, his choice to tell me, the wording of \"I met someone\" made me wonder if it was more serious than he was letting on. \n\nI remained calm, like I said, I wasn't unsurprised. I thanked him for sharing it with me. I told him it didn't bother me, and that I didn't see any particular reason we couldn't keep our plans and have dinner together, two people getting to know each other. His response was \"Let's get together Friday then!\"\n\nEver since, he has been back to how he was before. Talking about how he couldn't wait to get together. Discussing where we are going to have dinner. Sending me random pictures or audio clips. Thing have been really great. \n\nI dunno if things didn't work out with the girl he met. Or, if he is just trying to make the best out of the current situation, and then once we meet, he can make a go of it with the other girl. \n\nAt this point, I will just take it minute by minute, and enjoy the date for what it is. And fully expect to never hear from him again. \n\nAm I silly for continuing on with this date?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678478701.0},{"title":"I feel like i\u2019m selfish.

The girl I was dating was the brightest and most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever met, and we have lived some of the best years of our lives together. But the truth is, I\u2019ve always been sexually frustrated by this relationship.\nWhile in that relationship, I was constantly staring at other girls when we went out, and I was super addicted to porn. For years, I kind of just ignored this frustration, and in turn it became an unhealthy obsession that made me kinda socially weird and anxious with girls.\n\nWhen she left me, she almost instantly had sex with her best friend. That shit destroyed me mentally. I still have scars.\nI spent weeks, months even, picturing the scene of them having sex for the first time in my head. I re-created the scenario of that night. Tried to imagine every little detail. \nHer telling him she\u2019s finally single.\n The tension building up. \nTheir first kiss at that music concert.\n The two of them, drunk, going at his place. \nHer undressing for the first time in front of him.\n His reaction. \nAnd then the night of passionate love they had, which must have been a 100 times more intense than it ever was with me.\n\nA year later, I have been unable to connect in a sentimental way with any females. No matter how much I crave it, it's simply not happening. I haven't met anyone new in years. I've had the same friends for a loooong time.  As for work\/studies, I\u2019m a university student in France, which is an incredibly lonely and miserable life. I often spent entire weeks without talking to anyone at uni.\nBut i've tried to talk to women in my classes. Not in a seductive way, just trying to make new-friends way. So far, it worked a total amount of 0,00 times, in like, two years of attending. At least a dozen different students from my uni, mostly female, have rejected any of my friendship attempts. It was extra painful everytime because it was such a huge effort. I felt ankward, weird and vulnerable. And every single time, these people have ignored me, or rejected me in a very blunt way.\n\nI have tried using Tinder to find sex, but everytime I created a profile, it made me even more depressed. I'm 23, tall and balding. Physically, I feel like a monster. When I look at myself in the mirror, I truly wonder how anyone decent could be attracted by me. I hate taking photos of myself. I hate selling myself to strangers because I feel like I have no value as a person.\n\nWhen I go to a concert now, or roam the hallways of my uni, I can't help myself but to stare at girls. I just need to look at a beautiful girl's face for 5 seconds and I feel weird in my chest. \nWhen that happens, I kinda melt on the inside and feel ultra vulnerable. It feels like falling in love with strangers constantly, just by looking at them.\n\nSo I'm like a walking tiny ball of anxiety and insecurity. The only thing that really helps me numb the pain is getting high alone in front of my computer and playing online games. That's kind of my only escape from the physical reality of  being emotionally and sexually starved.\n\nThat's it. Sorry for oversharing.

I went for connection (as in shared passions, interests, and humor) rather than looks. My girlfriend is very pretty. The other girl was the girl I thought about since high school but we didn't really connect like how my girlfriend and I still do to this day.

We met on Bumble and everything was going smoothly and then we exchanged numbers and eventually went on a bowling date and went to Buffalo Wild Wings after. After the date, she let me know her previous 3 year relationship ended with her boyfriend cheating on her 5 months ago. On top of that, she let me know she had been going on dates prior to mine that didn\u2019t pan out, which led me to think about how much time did she truly give herself to heal after being cheated on. The date was fun, but something felt \u201coff\u201d, like my gut feeling was saying we weren\u2019t connecting too much. In fact, after the date and numerous times after seeing her throughout the two weeks she\u2019d say something along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still talking to me.\u201d For whatever reason, that rubbed me the wrong way. Despite all of this, I still wanted to give her a chance. Fast forward to last night, after making out for hours, she wasn\u2019t ready to have sex yet, which was perfectly fine to me, I let her know that I would respect how she feels. However she then asked, \u201cIs this the same treatment you give to all the other girls you talked to?\u201d And that also rubbed me the wrong way because the way she asked that felt very condescending. It rubbed me the wrong way to the point where I questioned her face to face if she is ready for a potential relationship. I then gave my reasoning for asking this question by referencing the first point of her saying \u201cI\u2019m surprised you still want to talk to me\u201d and that it seemed like she was carrying emotional baggage from her ex. She then answered that she feels like she could still be recovering from an ex, but still try to talk to someone new. She also stated that she goes into dating being prepared to be let down. These answers didn\u2019t sit right with me and I let her know that I was done talking to her right there (nicely). However, the part that doesn\u2019t sit right with me is that we were just making out 15 minutes prior and it just looks like I was just trying to have sex with her, rather than actually trying to potentially form a relationship with her. I knew my true intentions with her, but I bet from her view she could easily think I was just trying to have sex, but in all actuality, that\u2019s not the case.

Calling me, texting me everyday, complimenting me a lot. Also made some hints that he wanted to have sex with me bc he desired me. We ended up having sex 4 weeks after we started talking. He also told me he was a jealous type, and i was okay with that bc i am the same as well so I could understand. For example, one time he said if my gf would go to a club i wouldnt let her go or i would follow her with my car. \n\nIts been 3 months now and I feel like he has changed. Yesterday i told him i wanna visit a museum with a male friend from university. And wanted my bf to come with me too. I expected him to say yes etc. But instead he said \u201cyou go, i wont come\u201d. I was surprised that he was reckless. Later then i told him i was disappointed at his reaction. If it was me i wouldnt let him go with his female friend. Then he said \u201cokay im not letting u either then, dont go\u201d. \n\nOn Valentines Day he said he is too busy with work(i know its not a lie, we work in the same office) but at least i expected a rose etc. But i got nothing. \n\nHe used to offer me coffee dates after work. No more coffee dates after work either even when he is not working extra time. \n\nI told him i wanna go to abroad with my friend and he said only \u201chave a good time\u201d. \n\nAlso to try him i said i wanna move to abroad. And he asked \u201cwhat will u do there?\u201d I said \u201cI will work.\u201d And he said \u201cokay, good luck\u201d. Then I told him \u201coh, you dont even wanna come with me etc\u201d and he said \u201cI know u cannot do that bc u are shy\u201d. So is he thinking he is the only option for me ? So now he feels like he doesnt make an effort? \n\nOne day i texted him \u201cmorning love\u2764\ufe0f\u201d message and no response from him. He texted me in the evening. The day after i told him i was broken for not getting a morning back. And he told me \u201cu know its bc of work, im busy. I apologize\u201d. But that day i saw him going to lunch with his friends. Its obvious that he didn\u2019t care. I think nobody is too busy to write morning. It takes seconds. \n\nI really dont understand if he loves me or not. \n\nTDLR; my bf was too interested and showed attention in the beginning. But after 3 months he is acting so reckless.

We r planning our next meet up but he has requested for sex he\u2019s only turned on if I wear lingerie, red lipstick and eyelashes and have a hairstyle. I\u2019m not into that and never wear make up. I like how natural I look and down own lingerie cos 1 too embarrassed to buy it and 2 live with my family so idk how to wash it secretly. Anyways. Last sleepover he just slept the whole time and we barely had sex. When we did he just kept pulling out. He refused to wear a condom, like like every time and ended up cumming on top on my vagina, like in the middle of me on top. He promised it can\u2019t make me pregnant.

I loved it, but left as well and he said can that be my gift? Do u accept it?

But my life is the only one I have complete control of. It\u2019s a beautiful thing but kinda spooky I\u2019ll be honest. Been through a good bit I\u2019d say and a lot of dark times. I usually come back out better than ever. One of my dreams I\u2019ve had for a long time is to have a wife that loves me and cares for me as much as I love and care for her. I want the big nice house on a few acres with a little barn and animals that she adores and that we\u2019d take care of. I want to be able to slow dance in the living room in the evening with her and just hold each other. I want that so bad and I really would do anything for that. \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get that. It legit breaks my heart to know that. I can be hopeful yeah but realistically and statistically it\u2019s not likely. It genuinely fucks with me to know that one simple thing I want I\u2019ll probably never have. Legit whenever I wake up or when I\u2019m trying to sleep, I\u2019m just alone and with my thoughts. Whenever I achieve something or finish making a song or anything with my hobbies, I\u2019m alone. I know everyone says live for yourself, but I live for myself every day and as \u201cfreeing\u201d as it is, I legit want to send a 9mm through whatever part of my body just so I maybe scare myself into wanting to live alone even longer. Unfortunate though because I\u2019m not scared of death. Being in the army did that to me and there was about 6 times where the possibility of death was much more likely than normal. Anyway, I have so much coming for me right around the corner and so many experiences I\u2019m about to have. But there\u2019s obviously one that I want more than any, and that\u2019s to live with and be with someone who genuinely loves me. I\u2019ve got a lot going on in life right now and I want to be able to bring someone along for the ride. Someone that wants it all and everything it comes with. Someone not afraid of growth and challenges. I\u2019d be supportive of them every step of the way as well. It sucks that dating in todays world is complete shit and so are the people. Doing everything I can to try to find the right person but you rarely find real love. Usually it just shows up one day and you might not even realize. If my future wife is out there, I just want you to know I\u2019m trying as hard as I can for us.

However, he's always been emotionally unpredictable I'll admit. He had a painful breakup months before we got closer.  We've become more involved with each others families and I'm leaving for active duty soon.\n\nWe decided to get engaged while working on our goals. Since he travels and I'll be away I won't see him a lot so it didn't seem like a bad idea. We would technically just live together and just grow closer. We genuinely do love each other and treat one another like lovers and best friends. And I felt it would be fine but perhaps that was youthful thinking. \n\n I expressed my growing feelings towards him after he said he was emotionally unavailable by saying this: You're not ready for anything deeper because of your break up before. You're emotionally unavailable. I do think you should be alone. At first I felt stupid for allowing myself to fall for you slowly. It's not in full affect I'd say because it's hard for me to really see past some things rn. But I do really love you more and more each day. But I realize that what's best for me to do. Is to love you how I can but also allow you to heal, and find who you are alone and what you really want\/need in the people in your life going forward.\"\n\nHe responded by saying this: \"I love our relationship and couldn't have asked for anything better when it comes to you but myself,  I been starting to feel like I'm moving fast again.  I need to slow myself down again. I haven't been talking much cause I'm stretching just a Lil thin doing alot of things, and my brain can't keep up. I really appreciate your support though. \"\n\nWhat I'm getting from this is he doesn't want me in anyway but sexually and as close friend until he heals. I don't want him to have to tell me twice that he isnt into me. Hes still my best friend but I dont think I can allow myself to love him deeper. So I'm thinking I'm going to cut off everything sexual and our engagement.  I would get too wrapped up eventually and that's going be painful for me in the future since he isnt into me the same.

I was in a bad situation today, needed someone to talk to urgently. Texted him, no response. Nothing. Not even are you okay. But where do I see him most active at? Instagram. Posting a video of himself with other girls all over him. It\u2019s hilarious. I just want to ask the people of reddit one thing, why do men go out of there way just to make you feel cared for, but in reality all they\u2019re doing is making you feel comfortable enough to be used? Honestly I feel like there\u2019s no need to ask him what we are. If you feel as if I\u2019m overreacting, please let me know.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678445089.0},{"title":"As a guy, I've never been \"creeped on\" until now.","author":"throwaway9999919199","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11n8p31\/as_a_guy_ive_never_been_creeped_on_until_now\/","text":"Honestly throughout my life I really tried to stay away from pretty much anyone, and was reclusive. In this stage in my life, I am in positions where I have to be around people.\n\nLately, I would say I've been extremely confident. I am comfortable with myself, and I'm doing more things that are considered healthy.\n\nWell, at first when I started getting attention, part of me was almost flattered by it, but I still knew that the people behaving that way were kinda sketchy. Now it seems like people are starting to like me, and you'd think that that would be great, but you do recognize a new issue when it happens. The people that you DON'T WANT looking at you are looking at you.\n\nSafety is very important to me. I want people around me to be safe, and so it's very hard for me to start seeing this behavior that seems to disregard any sort of boundaries that I try to hold up.\n\nObviously I'm happy that I seem to be worth something in the eyes of other people, it's just that it can be very exhausting now that it seems that more people are looking at me and I have to be careful of creeps.\n\nYou really don't think that women can be creeps but they can. I'll be honest, women have been a mystery to me my whole life but somehow it's almost comforting to know that they can sometimes be just as deprived as some men are.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678407057.0},{"title":"I think I'm doing something wrong and need serious dating advice \ud83d\ude2b (Sorry for the long post)","author":"Mobile_Specialist_94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11nl3eo\/i_think_im_doing_something_wrong_and_need_serious\/","text":"* I\u2019ve been going out with a guy (Ben 26M) who I met via a dating app, we had 3 nice dates. He seems to be taking it slow and we have only had a quick kiss by the end of date number 3 which I initiated. He seems to be serious about getting to know me well and is enthusiastic about our dates. He is pretty shy and does'nt really flirt when we meet, but sometimes on text he tries to flirt, but it's not very obvious. Our dates have been more about talking a lot, having a lot of deep conversations about various general topics and also joking around. It\u2019s a very friendly vibe more than romantic or flirty. I definitely like him and would like to take things further but he seems quite passive\/shy in talking about what he's looking for. I don't even know yet if he likes me romantically because he hasn't said anything yet. \n* I\u2019ve also been texting with another guy (Jim 28M) who I met at a party long time ago and we had exchanged socials but never stayed in touch. Recently one month ago he started to text me. He doesn\u2019t live in my city, but rather in a city thats 6 hours away. He is very flirty and conversations are good too. He is also from the same country and same cultural background as me and we come from the same home town too so we have a lot of common things to talk about. We are also in similar field of work. He calls me beautiful and compliments me on my way of thinking etc. In general he is very flirty and makes me feel very good. We have been texting a fair amount since about 3 weeks and he has now started to suggest meeting each other. He says he really wants to meet me and he would come to my city soon so we can meet. He texted me how he is so happy that we started talking and he can\u2019t wait to meet me. He tries to find dates when he could visit my city and we could have a date but I've just been avoiding that question.\n* I am a girl (26F) looking for a serious relationship and not someone who flirts with many boys at the same time. I feel like I\u2019m lying to both of them since I\u2019m having serious conversations with both. Jim is more direct and seems to be looking for a serious relationship and companionship, and is approaching things\/talks in that way. Ben is more shy and is all about getting to know me better as a friend first and simulating deeper conversations so he can understand me. I\u2019m not sure if he really likes me to be honest. While Ben is here in my city so it\u2019s easier to proceed with him and meet him, but I think I\u2019m also curious to meet Jim. But I am not able to reply to the flirty texts by Jim because I feel like I\u2019m being dishonest. Am I wrong here? Should I maybe ask Jim to slow down the flirting and be friends first? Both of them are really nice guys and I honestly conversations are amazing with both of them.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678442888.0},{"title":"What can I do to improve myself?","author":"Impressive-Impress-3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dating\/comments\/11nksd2\/what_can_i_do_to_improve_myself\/","text":"I (19M) am currently a student in my local community college working towards an associates degree and to transfer to a 4 year in order to receive a bachelor's in my area of choice.
