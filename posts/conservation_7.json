In that time I have become almost obsessed with carrion eaters and decomposition in general. I now have a Bioactive tank with roaches and isopods, and am about to get a Dermestid beetle colony to take care of some of the bones I find. I’ve become the go-to person for all things decomposition but feel like i still want to learn more. I do not want another degree and already have a career as a behavioral therapist and researcher. I might want to start doing research on scavenger behavior. What experience can I obtain (certifications, conferences, etc.) to learn the more advanced topics in this area? TIA!",

I like what I'm doing now, but I really want to get into actual, hands-on research and project management work, so I've been looking at Masters degrees to pursue.\n\nUntil recently my first choice was MA Geography and the University of British Columbia. Told my thesis advisor - she said it was too specific of a course, and recommended I pursue a degree that allows me to pick-and-mix my classes. Recommended I just take a class or two in Geography as opposed to signing up for the whole program outright.\n\nI'm now looking at an MA / MSc in Resources, Environment and Sustainability but to be honest, I've been totally thrown for a loop and don't know what courses to look into.\n\nAs per my interests - I've been covering landscape conservation and food security projects, so those are within my realm of interest. I also recently got into sustainability planning and sustainable cities (I read this book called Happy City, really had me thinking) and I'm not against heading in that direction. \n\nAny recommendations for worthwhile MAs? Schools to look at, even?  Any advice is most welcome!",

I've been hearing logging for many days now and went to the neighbors to ask about it. They do not live on the land they are logging. They inherited it from a property owner in 1906 a few years ago. They were hostile towards me and told me it was none of my business how much of the forest they would be cutting down. I walked home crying. I feel heartbroken. I look at this forest every day. I don't know how to cope with this, how to turn this sadness into something useful. I don't know yet if they will cut it all down and have no means of finding out, instead I must watch the forest I love be cut down over the next few months. I guess I'm just hoping someone will care about the destruction and offer some advice on how to cope.",

I am pretty good at writing, very obsessive about nature, and have good computer skills. I don't have an environmental science degree though, and I have zero experience with digital marketing, which I believe is what this path is called. I'd rather avoid a degree as I already have one and they are not cheap. Hence I am aiming for a no-degree role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the list of the Coursera courses I think might be worth me taking, both to gain more skills and knowledge, but also maybe to spice up my Linkedin with certificates:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSustainability course (seems quite broad, good) (approx. 25h to complete)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainability](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainability)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClimate change (8h)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/earth-climate-change](https://www.coursera.org/learn/earth-climate-change)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtinctions: Past, Present and Future (17h)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/extinctions-past-present-and-future](https://www.coursera.org/learn/extinctions-past-present-and-future)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBroader course on renewables and general energy (37h)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/future-of-energy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/future-of-energy)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSustainable agriculture (20h)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-agriculture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-agriculture)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSustainable tourism (14h) - just in case I go into tourism work, and also because it seems interesting and relevant to our world today\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-tourism](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainable-tourism)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMountain ecology, geology, hydrology, climate, etc. (18h) - admittedly more of an interest of mine\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/mountains-101](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mountains-101)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroduction to Biology: Ecology, Evolution, &amp; Biodiversity (4 months, includes projects you have to do--I hope this isn't Maths-heavy)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-to-biology](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-to-biology)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUniversity of California Irvine, Intro to Digital Marketing (9h) - nice little starter?\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-digital-marketing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-digital-marketing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese two might look extra good because they're reputed companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoogle digital marketing (whole thing is 6 months, but could do just parts of it)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-digital-marketing-ecommerce](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-digital-marketing-ecommerce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeta social media marketing (same as above but 7 months)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/facebook-social-media-marketing](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/facebook-social-media-marketing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can anybody yay or nay the above? Is there anything I have missed out? Particularly on the** ***digital marketing for a nature charity*** **part of this.

What I’m thinking of doing is clearly very vast, but I want to write a report outlining what the 3 most effective (and far-reaching) policies/changes are for a political party to effectively combat climate change, specifically air pollution. \n\nSo far I’ve identified two: public transport/walkable cities which can eventually morph into zero fossil fuel-powered vehicles, and spending a shit ton on alternative energies that have been neglected like nuclear. I’m not sure where else to go with this. \n\nRegardless of location, can you tell me what the biggest and most effective change in your country would be? What do you want to see your government do to combat climate change?",
