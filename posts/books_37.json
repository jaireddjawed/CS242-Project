        "text": "This might be a little controversial but I had the thought the other day after once again seeing discussions online about some school considering banning some book for some reason.\n\nWe know there are constantly debates about getting rid of or censoring certain books. Whether its works like Mein Kampf because of their harmful content and despite their historical significance. Or books like 120 Days of Sodom because of their sheer grotesque content which some claim have no artistic merit. Or books like Rushdie's The Satanic Verses because of the offence they cause particular groups. \n\nI've always been uncomfortable with the idea of banning any book, because I don't think there are any that are inherently harmful if read critically. I may not agree with certain authors like Jordan Peterson and Tucker Carlson etc, and I don't like that their arguably toxic ideologies are put forth in the mainstream, but I can't say I would go so far as to want to suppress their writing. I really can't think of a book that would justify it.\n\nCan you? Have you ever encountered a work you'd  actually want to see thrown on a figurative or literal fire (by which I mean banned or destroyed outright so that it can no longer be accessed by anyone)? If so, for what reason? \n\nYour answer can be serious or silly but please everyone be respectful to one another.",

However to me it seems like the themes underlying the story were almost completely vapid which is what I'm disappointed by. For instance, I understand that a theme in the novel is the tug of war between free will and societal peace but besides Alex simply being caught up in this game it doesn't appear the novel makes a deeper point about it. It doesn't really provide a valuable argument for either side or apply an interesting lens. Of course I just finished the novel and this is only my initial impression but usually I find more to actually ponder when I have read something that is deemed as somewhat insightful. So, can someone tell me in the most concise words possible what is there to be gained from the book besides enjoyment? Or was Burgess justified in being upset because he is mostly associated with ACO?",

I was looking more into it and realized everyone is recommending the Robin Buss/penguin edition of the book because it's unabridged. The one I am reading is from \"duke classics\" and simply says it's \"based off a 1864 translation\". It has all 117 chapters but most likely is censored.\n\nI just ordered a copy of Robin Buss but I am wondering if anyone knows about a physical copy of the duke classics edition? I'm assuming it's one of the Chapman and hall translations and I also suspect duke classics only does ebooks so a physical version might not exist. Despite wanting an uncensored version of the story, I almost prefer the descriptions in the duke classics edition that im reading and would like a physical copy of it (if it exists). \n\nSome examples of how the description vary:\n\nBuss: \"The next day the weather was fine. The sun rose, brilliant and clear, and it's first purple rays glistened like rubies on the first foamy crests of the waves.\" Beginning of chapter 5\n\nDukes: \"The morning's sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby-tinted light\"\n\nLater in that chapter buss misses details on gold text above the windows, describes danglers hat as being a \"mass\" of ribbons while the edition I'm reading calls it a \"flowing knot\". Small differences like that which don't really change the story but add a different flavor.",

Why doesn't Winston say anything about that? And even if the picture is fake, then through all these years O'Brien and the people who helped him fake it must have know the \"true\" history, never really erasing it from their memory, contrary to their own beliefs. \n\nDid I miss something? Is it a common debate about this book? Did Orwell maybe even intent to make this hint (if you want to call it that)? Or is it an inconsistency? \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

However, I've begun to feel bored by it, the main reason being that the chapters dedicated solely to whaling are so abundant. I didn't mind them in the first half of the book because they felt like listening to someone talk about something their passionate about, which is always interesting. That being said, I feel like there's got to be more to those chapters than just someone being passionate, but I can't figure out what that would be. I looked it up and the internet told me that they were there to display the difference between Ahab and Ishmael: Ishmael attempting to reason with nature, with God, while Ahab responds with violence, and both in the end failing. \n\nSo, my questions are: is what the internet told me true or is that a misguided interpretation, and if so, what is your interpretation? Also, if what the internet told me is correct, why do you think it was necessary to go on and on about whaling, when, possibly, fewer chapters would have still accomplished this goal?\n\nI really want to love this book, and have up until recently, so I'm very open to being persuaded.\n\nAlso, feel free to \"spoil\" the book. One of the things that, usually, distinguishes good literature from bad is if spoilers ruin the book, at least in my opinion.",

You may be sick mentally, but physically your body is going to do everything it can to save itself.\n\nThe first sense to go is hunger. Depression was already doing that, I didn't eat for three days leading up to yeeting myself into the afterlife. The second sense to go is sight. The last thing I saw was my hallway floor and a pool of my own blood.\n\nBeing blind and not knowing what was happening next was traumatizing. Dying is a traumatizing experience. The whole thing was a traumatizing trip. I couldn't see what was coming next. I could feel the paramedics hands on my body. They were stabbing me with this and that. They were electrocuting me to get my heart started again. They started surgery on me before the anesthesia could run its course in my body because they didn't have time.\n\nThe whole thing was awful. And sometimes when the brain is going through a traumatizing thing aaaaaand when the brain sees the traumatizing thing again, the brain will \"reboot\" to prevent the trauma coming back.\n\nSo now I faint every time I see my own blood because that was the last thing I saw before I died. I am a nightmare when I have to get my blood drawn and I faint often in my kitchen over tiny knife accidents. \n\nSometimes it is tv and movies that cause me to faint. 13 Reasons Why before they edited THAT scene out had me on the floor unconscious. Brother was the first book to make me feel the fainting coming on. Words started getting dizzy, I was feeling dizzy, but I think because I wasn't physically seeing it I didn't faint.\n\nTHAT is how gory this book is. I had to sit between my husband's legs because I didn't know if I was going to be awake after each sentence.\n\nBut because of my past relationship with Death, that is why I like fucked up gory books. My brain was so physically broken and sick, it was terminal. Why was I so sick? My father killed my mother when I was four in a domestic violence rage. I never received the help I needed \"because boys don't cry\". This sickness grew inside of me for 16 years and I was just a fucked up mess. \n\nReading those fucked up books helps me understand that sickness that was inside of me. And helps me try to understand my father's actions. It is why I read and watch so much true crime. \n\nMy other favorite fucked up book is No Longer Human. I know I was not human when I was transferred from the hospital to the mental ward after my accident. There was no living or life in my eyes. I was just existing. I was 85 pounds and haven't eaten real food in over a month. I was physically and mentally just a hollow out person.\n\nI still remember being curled up in a ball with a blanket trying, hiding in a corner and trying to convince my first therapist that I was perfectly fine. Lmaoooooooo that was one hell of a lifetime ago. That was almost 15 years ago. I don't even know that person anymore. Which is why I like reading books about my past self, it reminds me how far I have come and who I use to be.\n\nSrsly if you ever want to jump in my mind at the darkest part of my life. Read No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai.\n\nDazai committed suicide after writing No Longer Human, some say the book was his glorified suicide note. \n\nIt was rewritten into a graphic novel by horror writer Junji Ito. He does an EXCELLENT job of pulling the illness from my mind to an illustration on paper.\n\nIf you want some light fucked horror books, I recommend Flowers in the Attic or any VC Andrews book. I had no idea why I loved her books in high school. Turns out I connected really well to the characters with generational trauma embedded into their DNA. It is the same story over and over again in all the books. A female teenager learns a dark and terrible family secret. Incest, murder, dead twin not really dead, forbidden love, secret sibling, mystery medical illness, etc. It is cliche after a point but sometimes the same story over and over again is comforting.\n\nMy husband always jokes \"why do you need read a V C Andrews book? Your family history IS a V C Andrews book.\".\n\nI'm done trauma dumping for the day lol. If you got any favorite fucked up books, share it! I am always open about my experience because it makes people suffering from the same thing a little less alone. So if you want to share why you like those books, go ahead!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/117lxj9/some_questions_about_time_paradoxes_and_mechanics/",
        "text": "**TIME PARADOXES:**\n\nI know I'm about to open up Pandora's box of time systems in fantasy stories, but I'm curious nonetheless. I wouldn't be asking about this if it wasn't addressed in the story because we could just write it off as not being important for some reason, but (correct me if I'm wrong, which I probably am) isn't there a few instances where there is a plot point that involves some sort of avoidance of a time paradox or a plot point that creates a time paradox?\n\nI can't think of any direct examples from the books off the top of my head (I've only read books 1 &amp; 2, but spoilers are welcome) but I remember Jacob stayed on the 2016 end of the loop at the tower that closed and went to see Abe again, but is that the same Abe that we later saw dead? Was that a different Abe (implying branch timelines)? There is also another instance where Abe picks up the phone at the airbase back in Mrs. Peregrine's loop before the wights find it, and Jacob, his future grandson, answers. Now, if Abe were to die within the period between 1943 and when Jacob was born because Jacob created a butterfly effect with his words, that would mean that Jacob wouldn't exist. This also implies that any major time paradox is solved with branch timelines. Is there any instances in the book where branch timelines are also implied? Do they hop between them occasionally?  \n\n\n**MECHANICS OF LOOPS:**  \nFurthermore, what are the exact mechanics of loops? We know that when a peculiar enters a loop, all the matter and subatomic particles that make them who they are (+ their soul in this case because I've heard talk that humans can only enter loops if they have peculiar souls???) stay intact while they are being transported throughout time to different locations along the universal time axis. So then, is this method of keeping souls and the subatomic particles that make up all humans in the loop intact during time travel how the peculiar children retain their memories? How long can a ymbrine create a loop for? Only exactly 1 revolution of the planetary body that they are on, or is it an amount of time a ymbrine can define? What happens when a loop isn't reset? Can a new loop be made right after the old one closes, and the ymbrine just winds back time to before a major incident, then keeps looping time forever until discovered by wights? This also opens up the question of if there is a fixed \"player bar\" of time in this universe, where the main timeline is continually marching forward at 1 second / 1 second, then everything in the future has yet to happen? Or is this universe's timelines all happening at once, forever, meaning a change in the present would have an instantaneous effect on the future, which then in the future could change that instantaneous effect in the present.... but wait... a universe where everything is happening at once could imply that no one has free will....  \n\n\n**FREE WILL:**\n\nThese questions also open up another can of worms about the free will of normals &amp; peculiars. In a loop, does free will for normals exist? If no new stimuli was provided for a normal to react to, would they continuously act in the same manner for as long as the loop was reset? Do they have slightly different actions each day (a continuum scale for free will)? If a peculiar was to provide new stimuli that otherwise wouldn't have happened (they are the only ones who can make a large impact on new events in a loop if there is a continuum of free will for normals), does that mean that the normals now have more free will than they did? Or does that different action (compared to previous loop cycles) not change their amount free will because if a peculiar repeated the exact same events at roughly (within an accuracy interval of 1s all the way to something like 0.01 seconds for Ms. Peregrine) the same time in a loop every single loop cycle, they would have similar responses to that stimuli because it is just like any other stimuli they get during the day?\n\nI guess what my main question for this section is: are peculiars the only ones with an amount of free will that is substantial enough to change the course of the future?\n\nI know this is exhaustive but is fascinating and cool to think about, although I can see how it might be more fun to focus on the characters instead of the mechanics. But I like the nitty gritty!  \n\n\n**ONE FINAL QUESTION:**  \nIf the wights were able to gain immortality (hypothetically), could they (in theory) travel back as far as they could through loop hopping (since the wights are still have peculiar souls), then create a branched timeline by killing someone influential, then force ymbrines across time to make beneficial loops where they could just do whatever they wanted, and their actions wouldn't have consequences because the ymbrines would just reset the loop?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read all of that, thank you so much and props to you for not shying away from a wall of text",

I want to be able to keep track of them because I‚Äôve accidentally bought duplicates. I‚Äôve tried keeping a track on goodreads, but I‚Äôm making a shift over to StoryGraph and they don‚Äôt seem to have all of them on there. Can anyone suggest where I can keep track of them (even locally so I can access them quickly on my phone)? \n\nThank you!",

There's not much point to this post other than to say I feel so different, even after just reading a few chapters.\n\nI used to read all the time when I was a kid, then more stimulating things like video games and alcohol came along, so I spent my time doing that. Coming back to reading has almost been like a return to the sweetness of childhood. I guess I just wanted to get that off my chest! Has anyone else come back from a long time away from books and experienced similar?\n\nHappy reading :)",
