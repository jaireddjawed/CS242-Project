        "text": "Dune is a titanic work. Its themes are grand in scale: the weight of history, man and fate, mystical immanence, ethnogenesis and environment, holy war and fanaticism, degradation and nobility.\n\nFrank Herbert - despite his genius - couldn't have produced such a work without drawing upon the stories of men and civilizations that came before. One of those stories is that of Shamil, terror of the Russian Empire, which Herbert was heavily inspired by.\n\nShamil’s life was lived in the peaks of Dagestan and Chechnya, where a warrior people resisted the advancing Russian Empire. Their desperate violence became the Murid Wars, a name taken from Shamil’s fighters: Muslim tribesmen and fanatical monks known as Murids, and their leaders, the Naibs. No Naib was ever taken alive.\n\nThe great chronicle of the wars of Shamil is Lesley Blanch’s 1960 The Sabres of Paradise, which Herbert read in the years leading up to Dune's release.\n\n\n&gt; To Shamyl, who straddled these mountains like a legendary giant, they were his birthright, his kingdom. From their shadows he first unfurled his black standard. In the name of Ghazavat! Holy War! he wielded the dissenting mountain tribes into the implacable army of fanatics whose private feuds were submerged in their common hatred of the Infidel invaders. For twenty five years, he dominated both land and people. For twenty five years, the Caucasians accepted lives of bleak abnegation and hardship − for Shamyl. His Murids revolved around his dark presence with the slow set circling of planetary forces. In life and death his word was law. All of them were vowed to resist Russia to the death. His four wives bowed before him in love and submission. His little son was sacrificed to the cause of freedom. His sister flung herself into a raging torrent, six hundred feet below, to die on his command.\n\n\nIt’s a long and somewhat meandering work, but readers that are obsessed with Dune, like myself, will find certain passages terribly exciting, and will recognise all the aspects that Herbert drew upon in his own writing: descriptions of sietches, kindjals (“To kill with the point lacked artistry”), kanly, the hunting language Chakobsa, and the fanaticism of jihad.\n\nI could go on at great length about the gems to be discovered in this work! Very curious if anyone else has read it. It’s 500 pages with a fair amount of tangential asides, but for anyone that wants to [discover the most relevant and exciting sections, I wrote a short piece here](https://becomingnoble.substack.com/p/the-warrior-and-mystic-ogre-and-saint) - please do check it out.\n\n\n&gt; Fighting was life itself to these darkly beautiful people − the most beautiful people in the world, it was said. They lived and died by the dagger. Battle-thrusts were the pulse of the race. Vengeance was their creed, violence their climate.",

        "text": "First of all, if this is not the right sub to ask this is, feel free to point me in the right direction.\n\nSo I'm trying to kinda work out a bit of a ship system for a worldbuilding project of mine (for ttrpg) and I'm a little confused on what exactly a ship class is. I looked it up, but most sources just talk about ship **types** and only one seemed to talk about classes, but I'm still a bit confused.\n\nThe one that explained classes was from a startrek wiki. It basically said that a ship's class is a certain design of the ship's shape. Does this mean that a ship's class can only apply to one specific ship type?\n\nCan you have a dreadnaught class cruiser and a dreadnaught class miner? (don't look too much in me specifically calling it a dreadnaught, my question is if a cruiser and miner could have the same class)\n\nWhat **exactly** does a ship's class tell you about the ship? Is it the general shape? the type of armor? the type of engine it runs on? or is it more vague in the sense that ship class \"A\" tends to have a more back heavy design, with this type of thruster, while ship class \"B\" is a more linear shape, but it's thrusters are not standardized, but it's more the type of armor.\n\nAlso, does this tend to be consistent with most sci fi settings? or does one setting take classes in a completely different way than the next?",

        "text": "Tl;dr: Dune is okay. A little weird, but not as weird as I expected. Its reputation as difficult is underserved. Not all that much to see here if you've read/seen/played a couple other sci-fi works from the past 50 years. Definitely watch the new movie though, as it brings forward the best bits.\n\n===\n\nThis isn't a serious review, I just thought I'll check if I can still flush my thoughts into at least some coherent form, as I usually don't wrote anything longer than Reddit comments and IM chats.\n\n===\n\nI've been meaning to read Dune for decades, but never gotten further than the first chapter.\n\nRather than any issue with the book itself, it has more to do with its reputation as obtuse and impenetrable, at least in the beginning. So whenever I gave it a shot and encountered all those names and concepts in the first 2 chapters, I was like - yep, I'm not in the mood for something this complex, and bounced off.\n\nUntil last year. After listening to the audiobooks of Cixin Liu's the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy and The Wandering Earth collection, I was still hungry and feeling ready for *more* grand sci-fi plots and galaxy-spanning schemes.\n\nSo, I finally got back to Dune, also in audiobook form. There are a lot of versions, after sampling a few I picked the one read by J.P. Linton.\n\nAnd, true enough, the first 2 chapters are pretty hard, and I was tuning out a bit; but after that? Surprisingly smooth sailing. It's all a lot simpler than I expected. Funnily enough, not all that much even happens compared to other works of a similar scale, and the main plot is mostly very straightforward. There are twists, different motivations and factions, sure, but overall it's not that complicated.\n\nEvery little bit of the world has something unique about it though. The humans are computers, flying machines have flapping wings, battles are thought with a particular style. Still, considering how influential Dune was on the world of sci-fi, it isn't dug too deep into the genre. While the worldbuilding is great and rich, most of the technology, planets, and the past is just a backdrop. I mean, sandworms are really cool, but any wild animal could be in their role.\n\nInstead, with all the prophecies, borderline miracles and the noble prince leading his people, it feels more like a traditional fairy tale than a modern story. Heck, the order of women with special powers are commonly referred to as witches. There's also quite a lot of religious allegories and traditions lifted wholesale from various human cultures. Having grown up on Karl May's novels, I wasn't impressed by this. But in the 1960's sci-fi it wasn't as cliché, I suppose. After all, Star Trek has been taking from the same pool of ideas for decades.\n\nWhat I didn't expect, is that most of the characterization and exposition, and also quite a bit of plot progression, is done by characters' inner monologues. This is something I've never seen to this extend outside of Ancient Greece dramas. (Just kidding.) It may be a bit on the nose, but I enjoyed this aspect, as it allows the reader to gain deep understanding of every character, including the villains. It's all done effectivelly and skillfully, and is another reason why I found the book fairly straightforward despite the hinted complexity: the characters just straight up tell you everything you need to know.\n\nWhat I didn't care for as much, was that the fairytale formula is held onto so strongly. Including the villains being nasty, fat, promiscuous, backstabbing and slimy, with the heroes being strong, handsome and noble. While there are some deviations, and the inner monologues certainly help, I still prefer more nuance than this.\n\nI also feel like the plot is sometimes a bit disjointed. Such as one character that should be important, has barely any space and then just dies in the background, and is barely mentioned? I keep scratching my head over some of these.\n\nWell, that's the first book at least. Obviously, my expectations were skewed, as I was imaging Dune to be this massive space opera, and instead it's just a small skirmish in the desert. It feels like a demo version of a much grander story and universe, with the author easing us in with this fairly small-scale hero's journey.\n\nThe 1984 movie\n\nThis movie is possibly even more notorious than the book. And dang, I can see why. I watched the extended edition, and I wonder if it's more or less weird than the original version. Well I'm definitely not checking for differences, I had quite enough with one viewing.\n\nSure, it's not all bad. The set designs are quite fantastic and the praise there is well deserved. But scene to scene, the movie bounces between flawed excellence and face-palming lameness. Or sometimes both at once. But I also feel like it might be contentious which is which, so I'll rather not specify. I admit I often find it hard to watch old sci-fi movies, but this feels like a mix of pre-WWII experimental German movies combined with communist-era TV.\n\nI'll say as much tho, it's a surprisingly faithful adaptation, including the characters' monologues and voiceovers explaining things (at least in the extended edition), which just don't work for a movie. I'm not the one to scream \"show, don't tell\" any time we get told anything, but this is way too much.\n\nAnd despite all the exposition, I wonder if I had understood what is happening if I've not known the book. I suspect that I would not. What a bunch of confusing weirdness. Well, at least Patrick Stewart is in it, and he saves the last bit of they movie's dignity.\n\nThe 2021 movie\n\nWhen watching this, I went from \"arrr now we talking\" through eyes just being glued to the screen to \"holy shit how is this so good\".\n\nThis is pretty much perfect in my book. While I miss the lavish design of the 1984 film a little but, it's greatly paid for by actual good acting, sensible script, directing done by a human being instead of an alien, oh and ornithopters. The little flying machines were my single most favorite thing in the book, and the new adaptation totally nails them. It's just all-around beautiful.\n\nJust like the older film, this one also simplifies and removes a lot of stuff, but with more nuance. Streamlining is mostly for the better, ditching tangential elements that didn't go anywhere anyway, or would require time and exposition. (We don't have any inner monologues here.) Instead, we have more goodies in the form of more rounded, human characters. As I keep harping about, the main story is pretty simple, so it makes sense to make it feel more real and elaborate, while easing on the worldbuilding.\n\nThis movie ends just half-way through the book. Since find the first half the more interesting, and the director shows that he knows what needs improving, I have high hopes for the sequel.\n\nNow I wish I could've seen it on a big screen.\n\nAlso, with the likes of Dune 2021, The Expanse or The Last of Us, it's nice to see serious adaptations of sci-fi stories that are both faithful and respecting of the source, while not being complete slaves to it.\n\nAlright, that was Dune. Not the worst thing ever, so I've already started Dune Messiah. Only 3528 Dune books to go.",

Ghost type Pokémon are another thing since sci-fi disagrees with the concept of spirits and afterlife",

Maybe someone can suggest me some titles to look for?  \nI already read both Ted Chiangs books (\"Stories of Your Life\" and \"Exhalation\") and I really enjoy his style. I also read Ken Liu's \"Paper Mangerie\" and I'm currently reading  \"the Hidden Girl\". I would say I prefer this kind of sci-fi, more emotional or phylosophical if you want. Another interesting title that I was looking for is \"Children of the New World\" by Alexander Weinstein, but I would like some feedback before buying it.   \nI also enjoy weird stuff, Vandermeer style.   \nI'll wait for suggestions",

For reference, here are some books/series/authors that I’ve read and enjoyed:\n\nThe expanse (series)\nEverything by Isaac Asimov \nTo sleep in a sea of stars\nHyperion (first two books were best)\nProject Hail Mary\nThe Martian\nWe are legion (we are Bob) (series)\nMurderbot diaries (series)\nDonovan (series)",

The series is an alternate history sci fi where humans developed space travel much earlier due to the Mongols never sacking Baghdad. The series is inspired by my love for all things mech (and my disappointment with recent entries in long-running series) and my goal was to write a fun story I'd have loved to read when I was a teen playing Mechwarrior 3 and 4, which were really my gateway to military science fiction books. The first book, [Chevalier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4PS5GHR), is free today and tomorrow.\n\nAlso free, is [The Dragon's Banker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TX1SJKF). Completely unrelated to War Horses, but there it is.\n\nI'm also the artist for all three covers!\n\nLastly, I've got 3 Kindle redemption links for WHB2 to my three favorite replies in this thread with relevant Starship Troopers quotes (book or movie).

I also generally dont read for plot but for characters and themes. \nHowever the characters were pretty one-dimensional. I liked their personality but they barely had any depth. That and the plot made it very hard to stay invested in the story. If the book wasnt as short as it is I probably would have dropped it. \n\nAnyway... aside from all those faults I loved the aesthetic, the AI themes and how they tie into nihilism. I'm thinking of picking up the other 2 books. Are they worth reading, based on my taste? Are they more character/theme focused and less action driven? Do they expand on the interesting world?",
