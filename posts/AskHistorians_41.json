They even captured Rostov on the Don and sent troops to the Caucasus. \n\nOn the other hand, the occupation of Eastern Europe might have cost them the war in the West that very same year. I am very interested in this particular episode and have 3 central questions:\n\n1. How many occupation troops did the Germans have in the East from March 1918-November 1918 and how were these troops diffused?\n2. How many former POW's were liberated and entered service again in the West?\n3. How many troops were freed up and sent to the West that same year?\n\nIn my opinion, these questions are very important for the outcome of WW I.",

For example, after some of the family moved to Lake Constance in Switerland, and the Arenenberg house now houses a Napoleonic museum.  Some battlefields are major tourist attractions with their own museums and tours, while others are unrecognizable. Some have rennactments - of varying size and quality. I have no idea what collections, libraries or archives would be accessible anywhere. \n\nWe are based in Berlin, can travel most places, and have excellent German and English, mediocre Russian and weak French between us.  Any places that you can point me, I would be most grateful.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "The eastern regions that I am referring to are specifically the Duchy of Posen, and the Provinces of East and West Prussia.\n\nStarting with the Duchy and later Province of Posen, I do think that it makes some sense. The Duchy was supposed to be somewhat autonomous, and voted against joining the Confederation, but the attempt to split it into two, a German and a Polish part failed, even though it would've solved the problem of the Duchy's Germans living outside of the Confederation.\n\nLooking at West Prussia, we see that the ethnic situation is pretty similar, so I don't think this needs to be discussed much, but the real problem is East Prussia. Sure, it was far from being ethnically homogenous *overall*, but one must admit that probably about 70% of the territories were &gt;90% German, and these lands also include Königsberg. As such, the overall importance of this region makes it seem as if it would've certainly become a part of the new Confederation, even if it wasn't connected to the rest of the territories, but again it didn't.\n\nTo be even more specific, all of these lands were a part of the Confederation between 1848 and 1851, but only on paper. In addition, I don't think that the idea of following the borders of the HRE makes sense, especially since the east was reconquered and repopulated in the many centuries of the HRE's existence. So... Does it really all come down to the inability of the influential politicians of these lands to get people to vote or at least support the idea of joining it?\n\nI suppose that in the end it really didn't matter, since the unification through Prussia and the idea of a \"Lesser Germany\" was pretty much inevitable. Austria, or more precisely the Habsburgs clearly wanted to stay away from the idea of a Greater Germany.\n\nIf I made any mistakes while writing this, sorry, but I'm too lazy to reread it right now 💀..",

Did it also then mean peoples time was freed up greatly as for the first time they could just do one big supermarket shop per week rather than buying meat daily and cooking it the same day? And did the fridge freezer mean that sales of meat went way up as people now had a reliable and safe way of storing it and even preserving it by using the freezer? \n\nDid it also open up a whole new transport industry in that freezing now meant your food could come from thousands of miles away (like Alaskan caught fish) whereas it couldnt before and everything you bought was typically produced locally? Did the fridge freezer vastly increase the variety and types of food that people then consumed compared to what they would eat before they had a way of safely storing food both short and long term? And finally was there ever any studies after the event that calculated the economic benefits to society that came from the mass scale adoption of the fridge freezer?",

The thinking goes that they were so egregious and difficult for Germany that it essentially “pushed” them into WWII. \n\nIf the reparations were the single most important reason for Germany getting into WWII, what were the reasons that Japan and Italy had for entering the war? If Italy and Japan could enter the war without being subject to reparations, so could have Germany.\n\nIt seems to me there were several reasons, eg megalomania on the part of Hitler &amp; Mussolini, nationalism, jingoism, etc, and the “reparations were tough” argument is used to absolve to a degree Germany’s decision to start WWII.\n\nIANAHistorian but I assume that at most the tough reparations were used as a way to rally national anger and get people fired up to support Hitler’s expansionist plans. They were not the cause of the expansionist plans, but we’re used as tool to support them.\n\nWhat do historians think about this? Is there something I’m missing about Hitler’s expansionist plans?",

Because how they viewed it might offer a clue in terms of whether they still felt a connection to Eastern Rome or if they viewed the Byzantines as foreigners. So do we know of any contemporary sources from the time? I know the Gothic war was disastrous for Italy, but that aside, did the average Italian see the Byzantines reconquering Italy and think \"oh thank god, our emperor is finally coming back for us!\" (ie they still viewed themselves as one with the Eastern Roman empire)? Or did they think \"who do these foreigners think they are, attacking our kingdom and trying to conquer it\" (ie they felt more connection to the Ostrogothic Kingdom and had come to view Eastern Rome as a separate entity from themselves)?",

He contested that muscle could be used for speed as well as strength (Isaac Newton had already explained 'force' by this time so it shouldn't have been a revelation). So he started doing resistance training with his Skiing team. This probably just means he knew the weight lifters were doing steroids and wanted to try it out for himself, or perhaps he was instructed to.\n\nObviously when the Russians started doing well at the Olympics they didn't want to admit that it was because they were doing drugs so Tudor Bompa's ideas seemingly became an explanation for their success. I remember getting an \"A\" in my exercise programming for handing in some nonsense I wrote the night before simply because I kept referencing Bompa, even though Bompa himself had no scientific references in the book I was referencing. (I imagined 'Bompa\" as a clown car noise everytime I used the reference).\n\nHowever, the first Olympics where anabolic steroids were used was 1954 with Olympic Weight lifters and Stalin died 1953. So Stalin is unlikely to have had any direct endorsement of Tudor Bompa the way he did with Lysenko. But I imagine largely the same regime and the same people who promoted Lysenkoism used Russia's Olympic success for propaganda purposes and had an incentive to promote Tudor Bompa as an academic genius. Bompa later moved to America and is still apparently an associate proffesor to this day aged over 90 years old.\n\nTo the degree that \"Lysenkoism\" is used more generally outside of the field of agriculture, I want to know how literally the promotion of Tudor Bompas ideas can be called \"Lysenkoism\". \n\n*Were Tudor Bompa's ideas likely Promoted as science by the same people, under the same regime, for the exact same reasons as Lysenkoism?*\n\nBompa has done well promoting himself in the West and his ideas have perpetuated long after the wall fell, being overly promoted by the Soviets may have been an albatross, but the results created from steroids may have spoke for themselves so the soviets didn't need to defend the credibility of their human performance science so vigorously.",

        "text": "The year is 3023. We can speculate that humans have colonized the solar system, or that maybe we have destroyed ourselves. In the former scenario how will “history class” look at the the 21st century? At that point there would be about 6500 years of history to study. \n\nAssuming all data survives, there will be a huge amount of first person accounts. Although most of us will be buried and forgotten, any of our social media could be accessed and observed. \n\nA few questions to consider:\n\nWhich events would be studied in class? \n\nWhich figures would stand out? \n\nWhat would our “Age” be called? \n(Age of Tech? Nuclear age? Age of information? Age of the internet?)",

        "text": "When Gorbachev tried to recreate the Soviet Union into a confederation of sovereign states, he was stopped by a coup. If the coup never happened, the republics would have signed after August 18th, 1991.\n\nHowever, according to history and political science, confederations are known to be very weak forms of government. They can survive, but it is more common for them to fall apart.\n\nSo, realistically, how long would a confederation like Gorbachev survive?",

Was Japanese language learning widespread enough in the USA to interrogate Japanese POWs? I understand that the number of Japanese who surrendered or were captured was relatively low compared to other WW2 belligerents, so maybe not as many Japanese speakers would have been needed in the first place.",
