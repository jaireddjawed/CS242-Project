        "text": "**TL;DR**\n\nI have very rare genetic diseases called [PPNAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_pigmented_nodular_adrenocortical_disease) (Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease) and [Carney Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carney_complex). I had an over 7-hour long surgery in which my adrenal glands removed, when I was in 11 years old.\n\n**WHY:**\n\nI had to have my glands removed, as they were over producing cortisol and causing my body to deteriorate. I gained about 50 pounds in about half a year, which was over half of how much I weighed then. I also had constant migraines so bad I would throw up. These symptoms were caused by [Cushing's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing%27s_syndrome), which results from PPNAD. At 11, I was given the choice to have them removed or die in my early 20s.\n\n**WHAT I DEAL WITH:**\n\n* I have to take Hydrocortisol and Fludrocortisone daily or I'll die (within 2-3 days).\n* I have an almost non existant immune system, which causes me to get very sick quite often. I have had 2 near death experiences just from getting stomach bugs, because my body cannot absorb my medication when I get dehydrated, sending me into \"adrenal shock\". My body goes into a coma like state and I am treated with the urgency of a heart attack patient.\n* I also have chronic, nightly nausea which has kept me up almost every night since I was 10. (yes. every night.) No one knows what causes it. I have been to the National Institute of Health and even they are stumped. We know it has something to do with my circadian rhythm, as it is every night at almost the same exact time (9:30-10pm). When I travel to different time zones, the nausea realigns with the same time, once I recover from jetlag.\n* Understandably, this has all affected my mental health as well.\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFO:**\n\nI have a ton of freckles (username checks out) in really odd places: on my lips, inside my mouth, on my eye and eyelid, ect. It's part of Carney's.\n\nI feel like all of this is proof enough, but here's a [picture of me](https://imgur.com/a/JW2z1SP) and a portion of my emergency medical documents. (covered over my name and other important info with sticky notes)\n\nFeel free to ask about the condition. Most medical professionals I meet know little about PPNAD, because it's so rare, so I'm fine with explaining it in more detail. I have some pretty interesting stories about being hospitalized at a research facility, near death experiences, and living with disabilities.\n\n***So... AMA?***\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nSome people wanted to see what the freckled on my lips look like, so [here ya go](https://imgur.com/a/GyGM84F). I'll probably keep comments and stuff open for a few more hours then be done. If anyone else has any questions afterwards, feel free to PM me.\n\nPlease limit trying to diagnose my nausea in those messages, if you're just guessing. I have really tried about every method and medication, and there's a lot of specific info that I didn't add to my post. We know that it isn't just mental, and we are pretty sure it has something to do with how much melatonin my body produces. The problem is that there is no way for me to actually test what we narrowed it down to a few years back, due to my lack of adrenal glands giving very off readings of my body temperature and hormones. I appreciate the many of you who have tried though.\n\nMany people have asked how it is to live with a disability, and I was thinking about it more last night. I remembered the best explanation I have ever read called the [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). It's a short read and I feel like it gets the point across really well.\n\nFinally, I wanted to tell everyone who has sent supportive messages: Thank you so much. &lt;3 It really means a lot, and I'm very glad I can help more people learn about others with disabilities and their own bodies.",

About six years ago, I joined in a show-troupe of knights and started researching sword-typology because I simply wanted to do things right and proper because they spoke so much about historical accuracy when I joined, however, my research drifted into armour, and I came to realise just how poorly the show-knights represented historicity, so I kept on delving deeper.Eventually I fell in with the SCA, and I'm still here. Ever since I joined the SCA, my knowledge on sword typology has taken a complete nosedive and, instead, I've gone completely into the self study on armour, using forums populated with both hobby and professional armourers and historians to learn, as well as reading books and avidly watching documentaries (most of them crap) and youtube channels (some of them really good).\n\nAnd now, I can easily lose an afternoon or an evening helping somebody source (historical precedence or where to buy) and design armours for reenactment and modern sports such as the SCA and Battle of the Nations.\n\nSo, well, AMA\n\nEDIT: Keep asking questions! There is no way to be \"too late\" to this AMA, I'll keep replying as long as there are questions, be it tonight or a month from now.\n\nThat said, I'm gonna take a small pause now, it being half past four in the morning and all that, getting some sleep, and then I'll make sure to check reddit as I wake up and answer any new questions as I do! If you're curious, just ask, I'll be around!  \n\n\nEDIT 2: Told you I'd be back!  \n\n\nAnd yeah, as said, does not matter if it's now or in a month, if you find this thread and you have any questions, do ask, I'm happy to answer.",

        "text": "One out of five children surveyed in Central City, one of the largest neighborhoods in New Orleans, has seen someone murdered. Four out of 10 have witnessed someone being shot, stabbed or beaten. Nearly half know someone close to them who have been killed. What does that type of exposure to violence do to the emotional, mental and physical development of boys and girls?\n\nWe’re reporters Jonathan Bullington and Richard Webster, and videographer Emma Scott from [NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune](https://www.nola.com/). We spent 9 months exploring how trauma impacts the health of children growing up in Central City, specifically a youth football team of 9- and 10-year-olds called the A.L. Davis Park Panthers. The end result is a multi-part series called, “[The Children of Central City](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/).”\n\nThe series details how repeated exposure to violence alters a child’s brain development and other systems in the body. It examines how the city’s fractured network of independent charter school operators tries to balance the need to address student trauma with the pressure to meet state benchmarks for test scores. It shows how lawmakers’ decision to reduce — or in some cases eliminate — mental healthcare services for children gives their families limited options for care, and leaves a handful of qualified providers struggling to meet the demand.\n\nAnd while “The Children of Central City” focuses on one neighborhood in one city, these issues are universal. Ask us anything about the series, the issues, or how we reported it. \n\nRead the series:\n\n - [The Children of Central City](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/) (An introduction to the series)\n - [The 28](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/the-28/): A football coach haunted by the deaths of 28 former players fights to save the next generation\n - [Science of Trauma](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/science-of-trauma/): How exposure to violence can be toxic to the brain and body\n - [Treating Trauma](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/treating-trauma/): Rates of PTSD soar among Central City children, yet state budget cuts prevent access to mental healthcare\n - [Malachi’s Story](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/malachis-story/): ‘He was showing the same symptoms as somebody that was in the middle of a war’\n - [Stolen Focus](https://projects.nola.com/the-children-of-central-city/stolen-focus/): Trauma can have a devastating impact on a child’s education.
