I mean I recognize it certainly has a place… but I have something for breakfast every day, usually a smoothie with greens and protein, but my partner fasts until lunch and has nothing for breakfast. I think his blood sugar may be being affected and I am not sure whether the fasting is playing a part. Usually by the afternoon he hits a slump and can get quite moody, and he barely talks by dinner time until he’s eaten. We tend to eat whole healthy foods as much as we can but we both have a sweet tooth and our guilty pleasure is sweets in the evening, which plays a part, but we try to limit it as much as we can. \n\nI’d love to hear all of your opinions on fasting/not fasting in the morning and what you believe is the better option to maintain blood sugar throughout the day.  Thank you in advance!!!! Annnnnd go!",

If it's not from waste and is basically coming from additional milk that wouldn't otherwise be needed, I'd be more inclined to switch to plant-based powders...except that I'm also seeing those tend to have higher levels of heavy metals.

So, originally, I bought grass fed gelatin powder because my hair has been falling out (I think due to alway having my hair in a tight bun), thin/weak nails, dry skin with acne scars, knee issues, and wanted to support my gut health. \n\nI went to a new gym and one of the coaches had told me that I needed to take 120 grams of protein each day across 5-6 meals (not sure how necessary this is). \n\nLooking at the nutrition label on the back of my gelatin, it shows 9 grams of protein in 1 tablespoon. \n\nWhen consuming 120 grams of protein a day, does gelatin count? Or is it supposed to come from meat, dairy, fruits/veggies, and nuts and gelatin is almost like a supplement and fills the needs where it’s lacking? Idk if that makes sense. \n\nI’m assuming that gelatin isn’t for muscle mass and more for the things I bought the gelatin for originally",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’m 22, I went and got blood work done on Friday (I forgot to fast though) and my cholesterol was 228 mg/dL and Triglycerides was 663 mg/dL. In May for the same test my cholesterol was 183 mg/dL and my triglycerides 139 mg/dL. Super worried about this and not sure if me forgetting to fast would cause this but it seems like an insane increase in like 7 lot hs because it’s like dangerously high. I do have a pretty bad habit and eating fast food &amp; drinking diet soda (my A1C now went down to 5.7 from a 6.0) but my eating habits I don’t really think have changed significantly since last time I got blood work done which was in May.",
