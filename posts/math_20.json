I feel a little ashamed for what i'm going to ask but heres the deal: \n\n  \n\n\nI'm studying CS and live in the EU, when i was younger i was never following along with anything in school being a little depressed. Now i'm studying Computer Science and i wanna learn more about Machine Learning (even passed an intro Data Science + stats class hehe).   \n\n\nA lot of people tell me that Math is not very important anymore in order to be succesful in CS but i've come to realize thats a terrible take.  \n\n\nSo i wanna learn Math. I've heard that to get more into ML the topics i should cover are:  \n\\- linear algebra  \n\\- more stats  \n\\- diff calc  \n\n\nThe problem is that when i look at simple LA on youtube, i can't really wrap my head around it even though people say you don't need any prequisites for it? The last thing i remember from math in high school was quadratic functions that were graphps (though i never understood how to correctly see a graph from a function in my head) and the basic ax\\^2+bx+c i think?   \n\n\nLike you can see i'm kind of at a loss here and don't even know what part of math the above refers to?  \nShould i study it all over before i go into LA? I heard about Vectors at the end but didn't understand it, even though now i've done some programming with 2d arrays and some linear regression without truly understanding the math behind it all.",

Obviously, this can't be applied to all topics or replace the usual exercises but I think it'd be nice to see a book encouraging implementing ideas in code now and then.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI conjecture if a sequence is bounded and divergent, then it has two subsequences which converge to two different limits.\n\nI defined new structures, to communicate the imagined picture/insight in my mind. A screenshot of my notes is attached to this post.\n\nAs a beginner who is still studying foundations of real analysis, I am really happy of myself, being able to formulate new problems and tackle them. I believe the ability to ask new good questions is an excellent skill, no less important than solving a well-defined problem.\n\nSince this is a new experience for me, It seems a good idea to consult some community around me. While novelty/originality is a great thing, I am afraid of deviating from a healthy scientific inquiry, and becoming a crackpot.\n\nMy questions are two fold:\n\n* Regarding the Am on the right direction? Do you see me asking and formulating in this manner a good signal? Do you have any recommended advise?\n* Regarding the problem I posed itself, Is it relevant to any literature or toolbox I am not aware of?\n\nFeel free to comment your general feedback even if not related to the points I highlighted. I will be listening to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xadazk4g3wha1.png?width=3369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bf5621244d90673f3614be760c9cb702071766d8",
