        "text": "\"At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobo houses that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.\"\n\nFrom his first page Marquez admits his incredibly audacious aim: to create a new and complete mythology centered in Latin America and denying the preeminent influence of Western culture. \n\nReaders soon find out that the story takes place in the 20th century. By that time Latin America had already been colonized by the Spanish for centuries. The name Buendia itself is a portmanteau of the Spanish phrase \"Good day.\" It would be incorrect to claim that these villagers are simply isolated native Americans who have yet to experience colonization. We learn later that they are outcasts from another village that our patriarch Jose Arcadio Buendia exiles himself from to escape the ghost of a man he murdered.\n\n\"Arcadio\" is a specific reference to the Greek region of Arcadia. From the wiki: \"It is situated in the central and eastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. It takes its name from the mythological figure Arcas. In Greek mythology, it was the home of the god Pan. In European Renaissance arts, Arcadia was celebrated as an unspoiled, harmonious wilderness.\"\n\nWhy then does he claim that his villagers lacked words? Marquez is being intentionally deceptive with his descriptions of time. In order for Macondo to exist independently he must divorce it from the times and customs of the past. It is a town before language and thus before writing. What we learn about the village in those times is necessarily a product of oral tradition not scholarly writing. He is implicitly aligning himself with Homeric epics and other pre-christian philosophies.\n\nThe term \"prehistoric eggs\" brings to mind some antediluvian era filled with creatures of the deep.\n\nMarquez is attempting something that outwardly accepts all the Spanish and greater Western European traditional while simultaneously casting it aside. \n\nThis is a new myth, with new words. \n\nInitially Macondo can be considered a kind of Eden. Jose Arcadio Buendia and his Wife/Cousin Ursula would obviously fill the role of Adam and Eve. Marquez does not shy away from the obvious implications of biblical incest and makes it expressly apparent. Their love is the original sin their Eden is a place of refuge but to apply a rigidly Christian understanding to this myth would be hopelessly reductive. In Macondo, there is no God. Even when churches are built and the strictly Catholic Fernanda takes control of the home there is never any indication that the blood members of the Buendia family are religious at all. They accept the unwritten myths, the strange prophecies, and contradictory philosophies without question. By the end of his life Jose Arcadio Buendia is more convinced of man's complete isolation. \n\nInstead Marquez offers a far more chaotic sense of spirituality. Characters are given strange omens, plagues of insomnia come and go, butterflies follow men, cursed indelible ash marks victims of fate, ghosts speak freely to the living, men become invisible unexpectedly.  He stops short of creating any kind of rule or structure. In Latin America the world and its symbols are self-creating. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm 3/4 of the way through his most recent/longest work *Wizard of the Crow*, and I would say that it's one of the best books I've ever read. \n\nThe way Ngũgĩ plays with the idea of storytelling, and the way it can be used to both further and combat dictatorship, was fascinating, especially given the fact that the novel is clearly written to resemble a folktale itself. The central premise, of a \"postcolonial witch doctor\" who cures illnesses through essentially storytelling, calls into question the line between truth and fiction. In a world where objectivity is forced onto the populace by a totalitarian regime, shaping reality through storytelling is, in a way, a form of resistance. \n\nThe novel is also a hilarious satire. There were several moments when I actually laughed out loud. The author translates his own work, so it feels much more lively and fluid than a lot of translations, though it still feels like there might be some wordplay (especially with character names) which is lost if you don't know Gĩkũyũ. \n\nThe narrative is driven by a cast of unique and interesting characters, which is something I miss. As a kid I read a lot more genre fiction, and I feel like a lot of literary fiction is so focused on ideas that characterization isn't focused on as much. This novel, I feel, has highly enjoyable characters while not compromising the ideas the author is trying to get across. \n\nAnyway, I've rambled enough. I hope what I wrote about this book made sense. I am not a student of literature, although I do enjoy it a lot. I've never read any of Ngũgĩ's other work, so I wonder if anyone else could compare/contrast it with this one. From what I've heard it sounds much more realistic, especially his earlier English-language stuff.\n\nThank you.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8z53ch/the_modern_obsession_with_plot/",
        "text": "Forgive me if I am horribly mistaken -- but am i the only one who thinks that novels of today seem very different from the old novels, and that a lot of that difference has to do with a plot obsession?\n\nI understand that the so-called heros journey has always been important to literature, but in my opinion, our writing culture has only grown more obsessed with it in recent decades, rather than less. A good example I always use in my head  is to compare a classic writer like Hemingway, to someone more recent like Stephen King. Obviously, everyone *says* that Hemingways books have a plot, but in comparison to the modern idea of what a plot is, like in a King book, they almost appear to have none. Nothing weird comes to town in most Hemingway books. No crime needs to be solved. No certain object needs to be found. The dialogue often doesn't even really seem to go anywhere --- it just sort of sounds beautiful. I'm sure such writers are out there these days, still, but for the most part, every time I open a new book, i just tend to find the sons and daughters of damn Stephen King, writing with only some epic quest in mind -- never just simply exploring a place, like you could say Hemingway did in *The Green Hills of AFrica.* (which I have read 15 times but still don't quite know the 'holy plot' of).\n\nI have been of the opinion for some years, in fact, that the plot obsession is one big reason that many fine artists have abandoned the literary form (almost without even considering it) for other mediums. In every other medium (even films) there is a place for plotlessness, for meandering, for surrealism and taking it easy.  Songs and paintings could care less for a plot.\n\nOnly the novel, and specifically the modern novel, especially in a post Stephen King and post JK Rowling world, is so obsessed with getting one particular character from point A to point B. I look at it almost like a cancer that has infected the medium. In my opinion, many artists don't even consider writing a novel, not because they have nothing to express--but rather because thre is this insidious idea that one needs some grandiose plot or idea, in order to start one. In other words, the idea of expression is no longer rally apart of the ballgame, in the average persons head of \"What is a novel?\".\n\nExpression has been traded away. Just get your character from point A to point B, occasionally describe some background settings, talk about a pretty fire burning, have your character look at it -- but there's no need to really express anything beyond that. It is more important that he manages to get the final object of your video game plot. It is more important that \"Harry\" ultimately defeats \"Voldemort\". And this happens over and over again, in novel after novel.\n\nAgain, maybe I'm mistaken and just imagining all of this, but its an idea I have had for some years. I'm not saying that plot is always bad. I just think its kind of stupid sometimes, and its sad to me, how convinced people are, that this is all there is to writing, when there is really much more. Everyone knows that books are not really popular today--especially in comparison to music. Most people just write this off as a result of books being \"harder\" or something like that. TOo quiet.\n\nIN my opinion, its really just because books no longer *explore anything* like music does all the time. Music explores ideas of beauty, of a carefree afternoon, drinking, dancing, just relaxing in the woods,silliness, ponderous conversations, etc. A lot of stuff like this --simple day to day stuff-- never gets a chance to appear in novels, beecause Lord almighty, the modern writer can't find a way to connect it to his insufferable f'n plot and his never ending need for 'conflict'. There is a literal sense of actual fear attached to not keeping up with a plot as one writes now, i feel. Don't maintain a strict and clear line of action, conflict, and plot? Someone in 2018 world may very well just accuse you of not even writing a real book at all. Hemingway could not have written what he wrote then, in our time. He would have been told his characters were meandering. Wasn't there some mystical obejct everyone had to find at the end of the War, Ernie? What were you doing in Africa? Certainly, ERnie, you were there for a strict reason -- no one has ever done anything to merely hang around and see things.  Or have they? Damn them if they have. \n\nI sometimes think the obsession our modern society has with the idea of \"being productive\" also is to blame for this plot cancer. People have become afraid to write a book of characters who don't do anything important. We must all be productive ALL THE TIME! \n\nAm I all alone in thinking this or what? Excuse me if i sound like a prick. I don't know how else to express myself, I guess. I have, after all, come of age in a culture that has relentlessly stressed to me, that all the world is, is point A to point B. Hemingway and other writers like him was an anomaly here.",

While there are probably as much fantasy worlds as sci-fi, the variety   is usually a lot less. Most fantasy worlds are defined and consists of the same elements; elves, gnomes, mages, blood magic bad. A lot can be done those elements and some truly unique and interesting setting exists using them. \n\nBut for sci-fi, each world has to be defined uniquely by the author. There are no two similar races of aliens. Similarities do exist but they are based on what served as an inspiration for the author. Some sci-fi is based on fantasy even, especially older ones, whereto races correspond to archetypes of elves, dwarves, etc. but even so, why is there less variety in fantasy then sci fi?\n\nCould it be because of the influences of Tolkien?",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nRudyard Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the British Empire, however his reputation stirred up controversy when the empire receded.\n\nSo did the sun set not only on the British Empire but on Kipling too? \n\nGeorge Orwell calls Kipling \"a jingo imperialist\", who was \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting\". Was he right?\n\nI read two of his ballads ‘Mandalay’ and ‘Gunga Din’ set during the heydays of the British Empire. I have re-capped them so as to determine the answer. Let me know what you think.\n\nKipling’s literary ballad ‘Mandalay’ illustrates the nostalgia and longing of a soldier of the British Empire for Asia's exoticism, through vivid and sensuous imagery. \n\nThe soldier recalls Burma as the land of the “Great Gawd Budd” and “old Moulmein Pagoda,” where the wind rustles through the palm trees. One can hear the \"tinkly temple-bells,\" watch the “flyin'-fishes play” and smell the “spicy garlic smells.”      \n\nThe soldier remembers the first kiss he shared with Burmese beauty Supi-yaw-lat and treasures his summer idyll spent with her watching the “steamers an' the hathis pilin' teak.”    \n\nThe soldier yearns for warmer climes and denounces London as a place with “gritty pavin'-stones” where the “blasted English drizzle wakes the fever in my bones”. \n\nThe soldier despises the “beefy faces” of English housemaids and longs to escape the colourlessness and restraint of Western life. The soldier hopes to be posted “somewhere east of Suez” where he can be reunited with “a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land!  \n\nHowever, despite the haunting refrain, “On the road to Mandalay” and the evocative ballad rhythms; I have to infer that Kipling’s vision is problematic as he idealizes the imperialist experience.\n\nIn reality, Burma was a colonial holding where racism was rampant, and the British were in Burma to pilfer and oppress the natives.\n\nThe second literary ballad ‘Gunga Din’ reveals the racial and ethnic divisions between British soldiers and their native servants in colonial India.\n\nThe poem is written in the heroic rhyme scheme of AABCCB and the Tommy dialect belongs to   a cockney British soldier, Thomas Atkins. \n\nThe lowly regimental \"bhishti\" Gunga Din is portrayed as a stereotypical Indian manservant, who should be content to serve those \"better\" than him.\n\nDin derided as a “limping lump o' brick-dust” saves the soldier in the line of fire and carries him to a “dooli.” Din subsequently dies from a gunshot himself, but the wounded soldier is touched by Din’s   dying words, “I 'ope you liked your drink.”\n\nThe British soldier comes to regard the native bhisthi not just as a water carrier; but as a brave and courageous man, “You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!” He remarks that despite Din’s dirty hide he was white, clear white, inside. \t\n\nThe poem concludes with the soldier’s encomium, “Tho' I've belted you and flayed you / By the livin' Gawd that made you /You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!”\n\nThus, courage and selflessness determine who the better man is in Kipling’s world. \n\nHowever, despite the admirable world view, I have to again infer that Kipling’s vision is problematic as he idealizes the imperialist experience. \n\nIn reality, the treatment of Din shows the casual racism and brutality of Kipling’s heroes, the British soldiers. \n\nIn conclusion, Kipling’s works do not resonate with the present political and social climate, so he does appear ‘morally insensitive’.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8ycysc/can_anyone_help_me_understand_krasznahorkais/",
        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI need some assistance trying to understand Krasznahorkai's philosophy before his shift to Seibo. I've read Satantango, Melancholy, and War&amp;War. \n\n**SPOILERS FOR WAR&amp;WAR BELOW:** \n\nBackground: Some months back, I watched Bela Tarr's magnificent film: The Turin Horse. Now, for those of you that have seen the movie, there is a particular monologue by the character Bernhard (http://kathiesmith.blogspot.com/2012/03/turin-horse-script.html) that I was never able to wrap my head around. \n\nAt the time, I wasn't sure I completely understood it, and despite loving the movie, I just forgot about it. Now lo and behold, as I was reading Krasznahorkai's War and War, I stumble on it again (though perhaps this is the original...) and I still couldn't completely grasp it despite having the context of the entire book. The monologue can be found here: http://www.krasznahorkai.hu/books_WarAndWar_III.html\n\nI would really like some help. When Korin says: *\"they've ruined everything they've managed to get their hands on, and by waging an endless, treacherous war of attrition they have managed to get their hands on everything, ruined everything...\"*\n\n**Who exactly is/are \"they?\"**\nIs it humanity? A greater force? I'd speculate it's the former because he compares \"they\" to the 'great and noble.'  For the \"great and noble\" the book seems to imply that it may be individuals, such as the four men of the manuscript or the great creators of the the world's fine architectures, who have faith in greater principles/higher power (or if Melancholy is anything to go by, the possibility of change itself). In other word, your Valuskas or perhaps even the hopeless inhabitants from Satantango. Ultimately, my reading led me to conclude that \"they\" are probably a contrast; in other words, those who seek to destroy other's faith; who seek to reduce everything to the mind such as Mastemann. \n\nKorin later says, *\"...thereby control everything today, and there is not a nook or cranny in which you could hide anything from them, everything being theirs, said Korin at his accustomed speed, theirs is everything that may be possessed, and the decisive proportion of even those things that can't, because heaven is theirs, and every dream, every moment of silence in nature, and, in the popular saying, immortality too is theirs - only the most common and vulgar of immortalities of course.\"*\n\nWhich seems to suggest that \"they\" have reduced all things - the tangible and those that stem from belief into mere objects devoid of any meaning. In other words, the struggle from Melancholy - where the inherent clash of individuals to create meaning in the object separate from the object itself - has come to an end. The logic which \"they\" utilize leads to the conclusion that Nothing has meaning - that good and bad cease. And the 'good and noble' accepted the logic without realizing the implication, which is what led to our destruction.\n\nI have no idea whether or not I'm way off the mark or if I'm on the right path. If anyone is familiar with either Tarr's or Krasznahorkai's works could please help explain, I'd be very interested. ",
