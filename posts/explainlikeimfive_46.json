Chances are very unlikely that you will not find a purchasable item for 1 Yen, or 1 Rupee so we could just deflate the currency by a factor of 10, 100, or any value which is suitable. The real value of the money of Japan or India would stay the same, but the overall amount of circulating money will decrease, and the value of a single unit of the money will increase. If I purchase an ice cream for 1000 Yen, after \"visual deflation\" I would have to pay 100 Yen, if the deflation factor was 10.\n\nAs economic inflation occurs, small value goods such as a notebook could cost 100USD in a few years. There would not be anything purchasable for 1USD.\n\nSorry if this makes no sense.",

That should mean people of a similar build and size should have similar BMR's, although I of course acknowledge that maintenance calories (tdee) differs heavily between individuals based on their energy expenditure throughout the day through exercise/NEAT, thermic effect of the food they eat etc.  \n\nI often see the claim that hypothyroidism means people get a slower metabolism/get a lower bmr, so I'm also extending this question to people who have a naturally low BMR: How does the body do this? Googling for what a slower metabolism does I just get the answer that it \"burns calories slower\", but how does one person burn fewer calories at BMR assuming they are of a similar size and body composition? Does their heart beat slower? Breath slower? Blink slower? I thought about people with lower BMR having lower NEAT, but that would be tdee and no longer NEAT.
