        "text": "Hi! I'm trying to get myself back into good study habits for Japanese, as I have not been consistent at all the past year and because of that have learnt practically nothing. I've suddenly got a bit of a motivation spark so I want to take advantage of that to build up good study habits and the such. I want to focus on drilling right now to get enough grammar, vocab, and kanji in my head before I move on to content. I'm thinking of trying WaniKani again for Kanji (I used it before but like everything else eventually missed a few days and those days turned into months which turned into over a year), and I would like to use Anki for vocab and grammar. I have a few questions about Anki which I would like to know before I start drilling things incorrectly.  \n\n1. How should I structure my cards? Should I always include Kanji with Furigina (if so, should I make the furigana a hint)? Should I be doubling *all* of my cards as double-sided? With grammar, should I practice it isolated or with phrases to translate? I mostly want to make sure that my cards are good before I've been using them for months.\n2. In regards to the above, should I also be making my cards myself? It'd give me more control but to get started with I'm not sure if I should or if there is a good basis. I feel like I probably know \\~60% of the N5 vocab and likely \\~80-90% of the grammar, but I need to look through the lists again. \n3. Is it okay to not make flash cards for things that I'm super confident in? i.e. 食べる, which is one of a lot of words I can think of that are just ingrained in my memory at this point. \n4. Is it a good idea to just throw in every N5 (and maybe N4) word into the list (that I need to, if the answer to 3 is yes)? I feel like it'd give a bit of a headstart before I go into studying with content and putting words I see in content consumption in flash cards. Or should I be using some sort of list of common words? If JLPT vocab, where can I find a list of all/most of the words used?\n5. How many cards should I study a day? I know 20 is the default, but it felt very slow when I tried it with some stuff today. I understand that the reviews can start to pile up but I'm not too sure how *fast* that piles up, and I'd like to get myself at the fastest possible pace that I am comfortable with (I'm willing to do flash cards for an hour or two a day if need be). I do also want to use WaniKani like mentioned previously so I'd also like to know how to measure and consider that. \n6. I've heard that Anki can have a lot of addons and stuff like that. When I look for the stuff it starts to overwhelm me though. Does anyone have personal reccomendations? \n7. Is pitch accent worth including in Anki cards (Tokyo dialect probably)? I've heard it's a bit more context based and not just black-and-white, but I also don't really want to end up having a thick accent or something that I could've corrected earlier. Is this just something I'd learn with corrections from speaking with other people?  \n\nSorry for the text wall, I just want to set everything off right because the last few times were disastrous. Aside from drilling, I'd also like to know when it's a good idea to start trying to understand content? A lot of the stuff I'd like to consume is just out of my skill level so I feel like drilling words for now is the best bet but I also don't want to be dead wrong and ruin my learning.",

I started learning a bit more than a month ago, and in the recent weeks I started with a teacher on italki. with the teacher we use genki and then I get a bit of homework,  I also try to read manga in japanese for like 15-30 minutes a day, and I have the japanese core 2000 step 01 deck. But I feel like i need one more thing to make it perfect i guess? It just feels like all of these things do not focus on kanji as much as needed, so if that's true is there any kanji learning approach or deck I should use that might aswell help me with reading mangas and vocabulary in general? or if I'll just read consistently and translate everything and use the 2k deck it will be enough?\n\nThank you!",

I'm safely at an intermediate level, but of course there's still so much I don't know, and still such a long road ahead of me.\n\nMy friends are baffled that I'm learning Japanese. I might as well be researching Gnomes or something. They might actually think I'm crazy, and maybe they're a little right.\n\nI've never been to Japan and I'm certainly not waking up early every day just to understand anime without subtitles. I've been asking myself recently why exactly I'm so fixated on doing this.\n\nThe closest thing to a reason I can come up with would be genuine interest and enjoyment of the process. Kana and Kanji are definitely beautiful, and learning to read them has definitely given me a little insight insight into a brain understand things at a fundamental level. I like learning all the idioms and the history behind them (膝を交える for example. It means \"to sit amicably [and talk] with someone,\" and literally translates to \"crossing knees\". The expression refers to how people would sit on their knees in formal / polite situations in Edo period Japan. So interesting.)\n\nI also, for whatever reason, get extremely embarassed when I visit a foreign country and someone from that country has to switch to English for me.\n\ntl;dr – Does anyone else just learn Japanese without a whole mission statement? Cause I feel like it's weird to have been doing this so long without a clear goal in mind.",

If the bottom-right looks like ハ, it's using the Japanese version. If it looks like 天, it's using the Chinese version.\n\nThe fix is simply to add Japanese to your list of preferred languages, right below English.\n\nOn iOS: Open the **Settings** app, go to **General** \\&gt; **Language &amp; Region**, and tap on **Add Language**. Select Japanese, and then make sure it's right below English in the list of Preferred Languages.\n\nOn macOS (latest version): Open **System Settings**, then go to **General** \\&gt; **Language &amp; Region**, and tap on the **+** to add a new language. Select Japanese, and then make sure it's right below English in the list of Preferred Languages.\n\nIt'll be different in older versions of macOS but I don't have any machines to check on, so if anyone wants to give me the steps I'll add them here.",

My work laptops locks itself after 5 minutes of inactivity and that's fucking annoying so I usually put this on to trick the laptop in thinking I'm active.\n\nSo I put it on because I was going to be gone for a bit and I thought: fuck it, I have nothing to do for 30 minutes. I'm going to interact with the chatters in Japanese. So I have a Japanese back and forth with 2 chatters about the weather, where I come from and where I'm going in Japan next month. And suddenly the main guy sends this: この書き方は and I'm like, that says something like: \"This way of writing\" so I copy paste it into Google Translate to confirm my suspicions and sure enough it means \"This way of writing\". So I sit there for a good 30 seconds thinking: how the fuck should I interpret this. Shortly after I see him delete that message and the other chatter sends a high level kanji: 無礼, I can't read this. I barely know the meaning of these 2 kanji and they don't directly line up in my head but Google translates it to impolite.

I've looked around and inquired on a few websites however I'm not sure if these courses or universities are very good. Is there anywhere that could give me a list of solid language universities? Maybe if any of your guys have recommendations from when you studied? I've seen from people on here that universities that are more focused on speaking the language than exams-focused unis are generally better? Is this true and is there any examples of such unis?\n\nIdeally I'd like to live and rent on my own. Is this hard to do or is it a case where universities find accommodation for students? I haven't had good experiences in the past with roommates or shared apartments and prefer to live on my own.\n\nI want to work in Japan while on a student-working Visa. Is it hard for foreigners to acquire a part-time job(s) while studying with only entry level experience?\n\nHow much funds should I ideally save up including course and accommodation fees? Money isn't really an issue for me but I'd appreciate it if you have ballpark figures.",

However, Wanikani is currently my main source of vocabulary, which means that I'm missing out on a lot of common kanji and vocabulary, plus all the words that are written in hiragana. Wanikani's format of SRS and using mnemonics have proved highly efficient in helping me memorize and learn, so I'm wondering if there are any similar programs that are structured based on the \"usefulness\" of words rather than the complexity of kanji? \n\nI could of course try to make my own mnemonics, but this seems rather time consuming and I'm not sure if I want to commit to this strategy just yet. (Though it could be a fun exercise in writing and imagination...)",

Sorry if this question feels a little copy-pasted from other posts on this subreddit, but I'm struggling to apply it to my own scenarios.  \n\n\nI've been learning Japanese for a while now, but my progress is pretty much non-existent due to consistency issues. I will have some periods of time where I am super motivated and will go through tons of flash cards in Anki or the like, but eventually I end up missing a day, which causes me to miss another day, etc... until I pretty much forget everything I tried to learn in that brief spark of motivation. I see a lot of posts talking about doing thinks you like to enjoy, listening/reading practice, etc... but even then, I'm not really sure how I can use those to drill in new vocabulary for me, and in regards to listening, I'm not sure if I'm at a proper level to keep up with Japanese speech, which sort of discourages me.  \n\n\nI do have an end goal; I'd like to be able to use Japanese social media, games, websites, etc... as well as speak to Japanese people in general (probably online too, I would like to visit Japan and use it there too but that's probably a long ways away lol). I'm sure this probably helps, but getting myself up to go and do things like reviews and practicing I always find myself struggling to continue, which makes me a little disappointed because I *would* like to become fluent in the language, I just can't seem to find the commitment.

For today plan tell us, to watch first grammar lessons. i tried Cure Dolly, and it doesn't fit to me, maybe someone will found that course helpfull, but not for me, it's hard to listen to, and there's too much odd explanations. Because of that i just typed \"Japanese grammar\" in YouTube search bar and chose PuniPuni grammar playlist. I think it's made by, i think, Japanese for kids. There's not very good English and not much explanations, but i think it's enough for the beginning . There's short videos (2-3 mins) and simple examples. And i also choose \"The Complete JLPT N5 Grammar Video(Game) Textbook\", i don't know is it good or not, but i think it is worth all time that i spent today and will spend during TheMoeWay plan. There's much examples, that i think not very natural, but i think it's ok for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course i didn't ended with immersion (actually, i didn't finished even 1st episode yesterday, it took around 1 hour to separate every by words), after grammar lessons i watched anime, and came across with some grammar patterns that i learned (i already knew that before that guide, but let's just don't pay attention to this). And that's good, because i saw examples of using grammar with context that gave much more understanding of how to use this. And i just realized how harder it'll be, comparing to English, that i learned the same way. But this just gave even more motivation to keep learning Japanese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's all for today, hope you like this and will read about my experience from next posts. Oh, by the way, I think in this post i made much more grammar mistakes than in previous, so if you noticed something, please tell me about that. See you tomorrow.",

While we may be dedicated enough for some  self study we all prefer some sort of instruction. We are all US native  English speakers.\n\nMy one friend  has experience dealing with Berlitz however they are much more business  focused, with the price to match, where as we intend to learn for more  personal travel and culture consumption reasons.\n\nWe  are not apposed to paying for classes but as we only have the view of  business based language classes I am looking for some advice on  potential alternatives. Right now for level 1 (out of 10 I believe  Berlitz offers) 20 weeks of one 2 hour session a week with course  materials would be about 1800 each.\n\nI  have seen the resource guide and a lot of different discussion  concerning classes but nothing that quite fit into what the 3 of us are  looking for so I figured I would ask. All three of us work normal day  jobs with some flexibility but can probably only do 2, 3 at the absolute  most if well planned for, lessons a week. As the three of us are not  local and we intend to take these lessons together an online lesson  would obviously be preferred.\n\nAs  for budget we would like to keep it modest, Berlitz seems pricey but I  don't have a good frame of reference.

(with a one month break in June, and then again in October) Anyway, that's around the time I got a tutor from italki to work through Genki 1 with me, which we pretty much finished this week.  Besides that, I was using Wanikani frequently until around October, got to around level 9 or 10 and then got lowkey burnt out, so I dropped it. I did pick it back up in January, but I decided resetting my level back to 0 would be better.\n\nAnyway, with all that out of the way, here's my question: besides keeping up with WaniKani and starting Genki2, is there anything I can do for now? I tried reading Higurashi with a texthooker and yomichan, but it's still a bit (quite a bit) too difficult for me at my current level. \n\nDespite having [passed a mock N5 exam](https://i.gyazo.com/24360717f88f370b489a74e7b493445c.png), I would have preferred a higher score and it just made me somewhat realize that surely there's more I could be doing.. \n\nThis post is probably a jumbled mess, but it is 3:00 am and I haven't slept yet, so please excuse that.\n\nEither way, any and all suggestions are very much appreciated it.",

        "text": "I've been living in Japan for the past 6 months as an exchange student here in Japan, and have just under 4 months left. I've been off and on studying for the past 2-3 years or so, but VERY minimal and never had a plan of any sort (teaching myself hiragana and watching japanese vtubers for hours and HOURS on end with no subtitles was basically the extent of it) except for taking a beginner Japanese highschool course for about 3 hours a week, but the teacher was incredibly slow, so I ended up learned everything (by accident without even thinking about it...) by myself, before he even had the chance to teach it to us. So basically, haven't really had a study plan before.\n\nWhen I came to Japan, I started using anki again which I had tried using before but eventually gave up on, and I did about 10 new vocab words a day for a solid 2 months or so, but eventually gave up again and now i'm back to doing nothing...\n\nIn terms of my current level, its very all over the place. I can comfortably hold a (simple) conversation with my teachers, host parents, friends, ect. for hours (most i've done of non-stop talking is like 2 and a half or so but I didn't struggle with that much), so i'm decent at speaking. When it comes to listening, I would say thats my strong suit. I'm pretty good at picking up new languages through listening alone and I can easily understand the majority of the Japanese I hear in my daily life, aside from the occasional, more specific or less common words. Luckily, I can practice all these things everyday since i'm constantly living with, going to school with, and being surrounded by Japanese people, so I can increase these skills without too much extra effort.\n\nBut the problem is with my other skills, aka things you can't just learn through listening or talking alone. Basically, the things I want to start actually studying. I want to work on my reading skills, but my kanji knowledge isnt great (mind you, I can read basic stuff but not anywhere close enough to read manga without out furigana or anything) so I want to study that somehow. Also, I need to work on my writing. I don't mean output/talking practice, I mean like physically writing out kanji/hiragana/katakana, so things like stroke order are also important to me. (please don't reply to this with something like \"you dont have to learn writing!\" cause i know a lot of people on this sub seem to think its completely pointless, but it's not. for me, at least) \n\nTLDR: Never studied seriously before, living in Japan with Japanese host family and friends, need to improve writing, vocabulary, kanji, reading, stuff like that, but don't know where to start because my level is kinda all over the place and i'm also a very logical person so just vaguely doing stuff doesn't work for me, I need a strict and specific study plan or I won't stick to it. Lots of free time cause no homework from my Japanese school and can basically just do whatever during class time as well. \n\nSorry for the long message, anyone got any tips? Resources or just general advice, anything is fine. I wanna use this opportunity to its fullest, and learn as much as I can, but i'm stupid and haven't really studied much yet lmao.

        "author": "artsyhugh",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10vm4km/etymologies_of_民主_and_共和/",
        "text": "Just found a couple of papers on the etymologies of 民主 *minshu* and 共和 *kyōwa*, which I think are really fascinating. Here are the sources:\n\n[「共和」と「民主」](https://www.seijo.ac.jp/pdf/faeco/kenkyu/194/194-chin.pdf)\n\n[The History of Konghwa 共和 in Early Modern East Asia and Its Implications in the \\[Provisional\\] Constitution of the Republic of Korea](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001775400)\n\nIf you look up the definitions of these two terms in bilingual dictionaries, they're basically something like this:\n\n\\- 共和国 *kyōwakoku* / 共和政体 *kyōwa-seitai*: a republic, 共和主義 *kyōwa-shugi* / 共和制 *kyōwasei* / 共和政治 *kyōwa-seiji*: republicanism\n\n\\- 民主国家 *minshu-kokka* / 民主政体 *minshu-seitai*: a democracy, 民主 *minshu* / 民主主義 *minshu-shugi* / 民主制 *minshusei* / 民主政治 *minshu-seiji*: democracy\n\nBut if you look closer at the component kanji, these definitions don't make a whole lot of sense:\n\n\\- 共和 = 共 \"cooperation\" + 和 \"harmony\"\n\n\\- 民主 = 民 \"people\" + 主 \"master\"\n\nSo how did \"cooperation and harmony\" become \"republicanism\", and \"people's master\" become \"democracy\"? Well it turns out, like a lot of terms that were chosen to translate Western words, it's not about being precise and perfect, it's only about having something *good enough* to express Western ideas. And grasping Western ideas was something East Asia of the 17th and 18th centuries was in dire need of, in the face of Western encroachment.\n\nFirst let's start with 民主. In classical Chinese, it made perfect sense given the component kanji.\n\n&gt;民主 \"people's master\" = 民 \"people\" + 主 \"master\"\n\nWho was supposed to be the \"people's master\"? The emperor of China, of course. This means that it was a synonym of 君主 *kunshu*:\n\n&gt;君主 \"monarch\" = 君 \"lord\" + 主 \"master\"\n\nThese two words were used as synonyms for a long time, until the publication of book 『萬國公法』 in  1864. It was a translation of the book [*Elements of International Law*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements_of_International_Law)*,* written by the American lawyer [Henry Wheaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wheaton). Foreign diplomats in China under the Qing dynasty at the time, who felt the need to educate the conservative Qing government on international law and diplomacy, began translating it into Chinese. This effort was led by the American missionary [William Alexander Parsons Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alexander_Parsons_Martin), with the help of Chinese scholars.\n\n『萬國公法』 was etymologically notable here because it is the first written text that translated such English terms as *monarchical* and *republican* into Chinese. Compare the following English extract and its Chinese translation:\n\n&gt;So also the term sovereign is sometimes used in a metaphorical sense merely to denote a State, whatever may be the form of its government, whether **monarchical**, or **republican**, or mixed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;蓋無論其國，係**君主之**，係**民主之**，無諭其君權之有限，無限者，皆借君以代國也 \n\nIt's interesting here that the two once-synonymous terms 君主 and 民主 were now used as antonyms. It's also ironic that 民主, a term that had been always about absolute monarchy and authoritarianism, was now made representative of this newfangled thing called republicanism. I can't say for certain why Martin chose words like this, but I do have a theory:\n\n* 君主 and 民主 rhyme, and even writers back in feudal times made evident efforts to make their prose more poetic. The Chinese tradition of [*duilian*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duilian_(poetry)), or parallel couplets, is a perfect example of poetically contrasting opposite ideas in the most pithy, memorable way possible.\n* 君主 contains 君, which denotes nobility, while 民主 contains 民, which represents the common folk. This is an unintended, yet brilliant, morphological contrast, in that the forms of the words themselves are opposing. These morphologies also map very well onto the English counterparts, ***monarch****ical* and *re****public***.\n* Unlike 君主 which unambiguously refers to the emperor, 民主 is a little vaguer. What if instead of meaning \"master of the people\", we could make it mean \"leader of the people\"? An example of an elected leader would be a *president*, who governs a *republic*. In fact, later bilingual dictionaries did use 民主 to translate the English concept of \"president of a republic\".\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"democratic republic\" in Wheaton's book was translated by Martin as 民主之國. Even though this translation encompasses both *democracy* and *republic*, for a good portion of the 19th century, 民主之國 and 民主國 were consistently used to translate the English word *republic* in different bilingual dictionaries. One of the first East Asian republics, the Republic of Formosa, was known in Chinese as 臺灣**民主國**.\n\nNow, onto 共和. The commonly accepted theory for its ultimate etymology was recorded in the [*Records of the Grand Historian*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian). Under the 9th-century Zhou dynasty, a king was ousted, and until his son was crowned in his place, the Zhou court was administered by two ducal ministers. This period was known as the [共和 regency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonghe_Regency), or the regency of \"cooperative and harmonious\" administration. Unlike the typical Chinese regencies whereby imperial family members acted as regents, this one in particular was overseen by non-familial dukes.\n\nThen came [Mitsukuri Shōgo](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AE%95%E4%BD%9C%E7%9C%81%E5%90%BE), a Japanese geographer. While doing research in Dutch sources, he came across the term *republiek*. He understood it meant \"non-monarchical government\", but since this concept was entirely alien to East Asia, he did not know how to translate it properly. He then consulted a Ruist named [Ōtsuki Bankei](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E6%A7%BB%E7%A3%90%E6%B8%93), who told him about the only time when something even remotely close to \"non-monarchical government\" happened, and that time was the [共和 regency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonghe_Regency). Mitsukuri went on to compose his own 1845 geography book titled 『坤輿圖識』 *Kon'yo-zushiki*, in which he described the country that bordered both Mexico and Canada (then part of Britain) as **共和**政治州. This phrase, which literally meant \"the states with a cooperative and harmonious government\" (the states that are united?), was meant as a translation of the Dutch phrase *Verenigde Staten*. 共和政治州 was ultimately displaced by 合衆國, a coinage by the Chinese, but the notion of \"cooperation and harmony\" remains associated with republicanism.\n\nBoth 民主 and 共和 were used to translate *republic* in various bilingual dictionaries in Japan, China and Korea. The distinction between the English terms *republic* and *democracy* wasn't at all clear-cut, and confusion was aggravated by English dictionaries, like those published in the United States by Webster. Heck, even in Greek, the language that gave Europe the term *democracy*, there is genuinely no distinction at all. To East Asian lexicographers back then, *republic* and *democracy* were more or less the same thing, different only in the fact that the former was Latin and the latter was Greek. One of the earlier translation for *democracy* was 民政 *minsei* \"popular governance\".\n\nIt wasn't until well in the 20th century that Japanese writers and lexicographers decided that, in a somewhat arbitrary way, 民主 should only mean *democracy* and 共和 should only mean *republic*. This usage obviously stuck, and was adopted by various modern republics, including the People's **Republic** of China (中華人民**共和国**), the **Democratic Republic** of Vietnam (Việt Nam **Dân chủ Cộng hoà**), the Socialist **Republic** of Vietnam (**Cộng hoà** Xã hội Chủ nghĩa Việt Nam), the **Democratic** People's **Republic** of Korea (조선**민주주의**인민**공화국**  朝鮮**民主主義**人民**共和國**).\n\nThe only countries that did not use these terms for their official names were the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the **Republic** of China (中華**民國**), [preferred his own term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)#Significance_of_the_name), 民國. The Koreans, in trying to establish [a new republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_Korea), named their country the **Republic** of Korea (대한**민국**  大韓**民國**) using the exact same term, perhaps because it had already been used in China where the Korean provisional government was being established, and/or because Korea had previously been known as the **Empire** of Korea (대한**제국** 大韓**帝國**) and it was just a matter of changing 帝國 \"emperor's land\" into 民國 \"people's land\". Despite these facts, after multiple amendments, the Constitutions of the current Republic of China and Republic of Korea still mention  民主共和國:\n\n&gt; 中華**民國**基於三民主義，為民有民治民享之**民主共和國**。   \n&gt;  \n&gt; The **Republic** of China, founded on the Three Principles of the People, shall be a **democratic republic** of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; 대한**민국**은 **민주공화국**이다.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The **Republic** of Korea shall be a **democratic republic**.",

        "text": "Might be rambly. Don't mind me; just doing some self-reflection. Tips would be appreciated though.\n\nI've been learning Japanese for just under nine years now , but due to a mix of being busy, being lazy, and just not knowing enough in the beginning, I didn't really develop a strong cosistent habit of exposing myself to the language. I've mostly fixed that in the past couple of years, but I still wasn't all that happy with my reading speed. For the record, I have enough vocab to follow and carry on a conversation, and Anki has about 2700 known kanji on record, but I still feel like the lack of speed specifically is what would kill my scores in an N1 or even N2 test environment (which I've never officially taken lol).\n\nI want to improve my speed by reading daily with zero exceptions. I had decided initially that I would no longer add to my Anki decks, partly because it took too much time. I thought the most I would do is bookmark unknown words on lists for specific books, and the reading would essentially be the review. I ended up going back on that decision though, just to make myself more familiar with rarer kanji that are new to me.\n\nI started myself off this year quite easily, just to build a foundational routine of reading every single day. I did so by reading the original manga for anime I already knew my whole life (Dragon Ball and 幽遊白書). For better or worse, it took virtually no time to get through the cumulative 61 volumes in a month since my understanding isn't really predicated on language more than just knowing what's happening. 幽遊白書 was a bit better at keeping me on my toes though, because the anime cut out a lot of content at the start and end of the story.\n\nWe're a week into February now, and I've decided to slow way down, chipping away at 三秋縋's light novel 三日間の幸福 at a single chapter a day. I expected to have plenty of unknown words, but in my arrogance, I was surprised to find that at 90 pages in, I had just shy of 200 unknown words. That was a shock coming off of the ego stroke that was 村田沙耶香's コンビニ人間, for which I had a total of 217 unfamiliar words for about 150 pages.\n\nI'm not too bummed though, because I do notice myself reading faster and faster. I don't time myself, but when I get into a good groove, I'll just keep reading. I don't skip words I don't know, and I take the time to hazard educated guesses before looking things up, sure, but it wasn't like when I read 新海誠's 君の名は, which took me a full month to read at about three hours per day. \n\nI probably could have beaten my record of six days reading コンビニ人間 with this current book by now if I had read more than one chapter a day, but hey, I'm also trying to make time to clear some of my anime watch list. I slowed down mostly for the sake of not burning myself out, but on some days, I genuinely feel like I read too little, not because of some potentially misplaced sense of duty to study a certain amount of Japanese a day, but because I'm really curious to see what happens next in the story. This leads me into the conclusion that it might be better for me to focus on one story at a time, rather than trying to make time in the day for both anime and novels. If I need a break from *long* reading to get through longer anime, I have some episodic manga to fall back on where each storyline starts and ends within three chapters max.",

I really would prefer no English unless needed to know the word and no romaji either.  My dyslexic brain needs as little way to mess this up as possible.  I also like it if it included the consent and vowel combination with audio.  Thanks again for any help. I have been looking for this for weeks and I feel like I am missing something.",
