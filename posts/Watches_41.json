I can't decide on a strap for it and figured I'd ask you guys for opinions. For those wondering I think it has a Seiko movement but I'm not sure, only popped it open to replace the battery and didn't really dig around the internet to learn more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Leaning towards a chocolate racing strap but I think it might be a good candidate for a funky sailcloth strap. It uses a 22mm strap so there are a good amount of options but I'm not a huge fan of NATOs so lets stick with two-piece options.
