Super AI. Heat death? Super AI. War? Super AI.\n\nNot *everything* can be solved by just having a Super AI. The speed of light cannot be broken, and warp drives would be impractical in a transhuman feature. Heat death is inevitable and no matter what we do, we will die. The only way around that is if a quantum fluctuation causes a new Big Bang earlier than expected. War will always be here. It may be for cultural reasons or because someone just finds it fun. Will we be able to upload after being killed in a war? Yes. But the ability to dish out damage has always surpassed the ability to protect against it. \n\nUsing Super AI as a miracle cure-all makes the movement look bad.

A movement like this, which focuses itself on the perpetuation of man, can only survive if all of man's creative efforts are pushed to their absolute limit. Transhumanists should take in the world. We should learn to study the human condition overall so that we may come to terms with our existence. And thus learn how to conquer it.\n\nWe must, as Camus suggests, live to the point of tears. \n\nH+",

We often speculate about the neat augmentations that may be available in the future. And we ponder about society's reaction and how we might manage it. But I also ponder about how to change the already existing precedent. I see a widespread disregard and apathy towards morphological freedoms. This is something that the movement could be working on right now.\n\n**So whats the problem?**\n      \n* Laws that specifically target alterations that society finds distasteful. \n    \nE.g.*\"§ 14-29. Castration or other maiming without malice aforethought.\nIf any person shall, on purpose and unlawfully, but without malice aforethought, cut, or slit\nthe nose, bite or cut off the nose, or a lip or an ear, or disable any limb or member of any other\nperson, or castrate any other person, or cut off, maim or disfigure any of the privy members of\nany other person, with intent to kill, maim, disfigure, disable or render impotent such person,\nthe person so offending shall be punished as a Class E felon.\"*\n\n* Standards of Care that unfairly limit the availability of specific alterations.\n\nE.g.\n*\"One referral from a qualified mental health professional is needed for breast/chest surgery\n(e.g., mastectomy, chest reconstruction, or augmentation mammoplasty).\nTwo referrals—from qualified mental health professionals who have independently assessed\nthe patient—are needed for genital surgery (i.e., hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy,\norchiectomy, genital reconstructive surgeries).\"*\n\n* General ambivalence to restrictions that do not affect one personally.\n\n**What could be done?**    \n\n*  The creation of a Morphological Freedom Index.    \nI.e. The creation of a metric for rating the availability of morphological freedoms to citizens in individual countries, states, and provinces.\n\n* Active campaigning by transhumanists against specific laws, regulations, and standards of care that are problematic.\n\nSo what do you all think? How can we convert today's society into one where morphological freedoms are respected?",

Becoming transhuman or a cyborg and helping others do the same is was what I had initially thought, but it didn't seem complete. \n\nNow I've come to realize what it is; the ultimate goal of my h+ journey is to help humankind get off this rock. My best friend and business partner is obsessed with getting to Mars and is a huge Elon Musk fanboy. I'd be happy with the moon as a first step. \n\nRelatively speaking I think getting off Earth and to Mars is easy, the difficult part of a manned mission there is surviving the trip, surviving landing, surviving the surface, and finally coming home. \n\nMy current belief is that this isn't feasible for humans to do as we currently are; we must be more. I envision cyber-enhanced humans in Iron Man armor as the end goal of this.\n\nOnce the tech is proven, the one way trips the first pioneers make will become the inspiration for the mass exodus. And once we have a large colony of transhumans on Mars, they can begin building the infrastructure to come home. \n\nIt will happen quickly. Before long we'd have conquered Mars and have regular 2 way trips and trade routes.  \n\nAnyway thanks for letting me free-write some of my craziness. =) ",

In other word's, would Boltzmann's Brain turn into a pile of sandy atoms?\n\nOr be able to wormhole through space much more easier without being a stationary object and possibly not just observe the cosmos, but *are* literally it, and are endowed with doing what a universe can do, just like you're able to walk on two feet because of the evolution of bipedalism in humans. So, what would it look like? I know, not physics at all, but if you're more experienced, definitely inform me with knowledge.\n\nSo, I'm inquiring that after I've eroded my status as living and transformed long (I mean LONG, like 10^30  years into the future, beyond the Type 3 Kardashev scale and more or less around a Omega-Minus or Type Z scale society. Can we even apply *anything we've learned now* to then, anyway?) beyond the post-human process, what's in store for a futuristic reform beyond the living experience? And don't just argue it's non-existence. What might we invent to make being alive itself archaic, and would it even be plausible in Omega-Minus type science?\n",

        "text": "**Disclaimer:**  *The following is offered simply as first-hand documentation of my own personal experience.  It is not intended as a guide or instruction manual for performing this procedure yourself, and I assume no liability for its use as such.*\n  \n**WHY??**\n\nWell I have been interested in transhumanism and singularitarianism since the early 2000's.  When biohacking first came up on my radar I was very impressed, but the tech was still quite crude and none of the specific applications sounded intriguing yet.  Many years later, I read a couple of articles about [magnetic implants]( http://io9.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-getting-magnetic-finger-imp-813537993) and [EM sensing]( http://gizmodo.com/5895555/i-have-a-magnet-implant-in-my-finger), which really got me thinking.  The basic idea is that a tiny magnet placed under the skin will vibrate subtly in response to a moving EM field, such as created by an electric motor, allowing a person to \"feel\" the presence and shape of these invisible forces.  \n  \nI immediately loved the idea of being able to sense a secret layer of reality that is normally hidden from people, even if it was not practically useful yet.  After some further research I thought, \"This actually seems viable!  I should make a project of it.”  So I did.  I chose to do it myself instead of finding a body piercer for a couple of reasons.  For one thing I utterly respect the DIY ethos of the biopunk movement.  I also wanted complete control over the procedure including use of anesthetic, the type of implant, and placement within the finger.  Most of all though, I simply wanted to have fun learning about stuff like surgical and anesthetic technique and putting it into practice.\n\n(Potentially NSFW) [My Magnetic Implant Procedure](https://youtu.be/l_tu3YN0DoA)\n   \n**IMPLANT**\n\nI used a consumer grade magnetic implant called [M31](http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/09/25/magnet-implants-ii-building-better-magnetar/).  The benefits of the M31 mainly boil down to its [titanium nitride coating](http://scienceforthemasses.org/2014/08/30/so-tell-me-more-about-those-magnets/), which allows for the thinnest, most durable, biocompatible coating that I was able to find.  The implant must be coated with something that keeps the neodymium from degrading in or being rejected by the body.  The coatings used in the past were plastics or silicone, which all have serious drawbacks.  The links above explain the benefits in more detail, but suffice to say it was mainly the availability of a quality pre-coated magnet that took this project off of the drawing board and into reality.\n \n**SANITATION**  \n\nTo start I did a lot of research on creating a [sterile field](http://atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/surgical-asepsis/equipment/field.html). Most of the equipment I used was pre-sterilized and packaged.  The implant itself was soaked in Chloraprep (Chlorhexidine and Isopropyl Alcohol mixture) for 45 mins prior to implantation, per the instructions.  This isn’t a perfect solution, but heating past a certain temp will reduce the gauss rating (magnetic strength) of the magnet so traditional heat sterilization isn’t an option.\n  \nI had trouble procuring sterile gloves which is why I am not wearing any in the video.  Gloves are really for protection from others peoples’ body fluids \nanyway, and since I was working on myself they seemed redundant though they certainly wouldn’t have hurt.  Before the procedure I showered and scrubbed in using Chlorhexidine which has a persistent bacteriostatic effect after washing.  My biggest mistake was not applying the Chloraprep to my finger before the procedure.  I put some on at the end, which is better than nothing, but it should have been the first thing I did before the injection.\n \n**ANESTHETIC**\n\nMost of the videos and written accounts I have found of this procedure indicate numbing with ice.  I’ve only seen 2 where actual anesthetic was used, and in both the technique used to administer it seemed overly complicated and risky for a layman.  I chose instead to use a [transthecal digital block](http://youtu.be/3np5HUz_120), which basically is just injecting the anesthetic directly into the [flexor](http://www.ajemjournal.com/cms/attachment/2004397291/2018599586/gr2.jpg) [tendon](https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/677/flashcards/1672677/jpg/extrinsic_flexor_tendons1342941787744.jpg) [sheath](http://www.atlantaequine.com/images/tendon_sheath_anatomy.png) of the finger.  This technique is much simpler and has a much higher success rate than the finger web and ring block methods because it requires only a single injection and the site is much easier to locate.  It’s also much safer since there is very little chance of traumatizing the neurovascular bundles at the sides of the finger when you are aiming for the tendon in the middle of the finger. \n\nThe transthecal block proved quite easy and effective.  Using very little anesthetic I was able to anesthetize my entire ring finger.  In fact the tip was so numb that I actually had a bit of difficulty making the incision myself because there was no tactile feedback on how deep I was cutting.\n\n**PROCEDURE**\n\nThe basic procedure is to make an incision past the skin layer, and then use a sharp object to create a sub-dermal pocket for the magnet to rest in, away from the incision.  As for placement I think a lot of it comes down to personal preference, but you want make sure that the magnet will never rest between the bone and pad of your finger.  I chose the least obtrusive side of my finger after determining how I use it for various motions like grasping and typing.\n  \nI positioned the implant using a non-magnetic wooden skewer wrapped in latex finger cots and treated with Chloraprep.  This “tool” was probably the sketchiest part of the procedure but it worked like a charm.  If I had more patience I probably would have looked for some high-quality plastic computer repair tools to manipulate the magnet with instead, but I don’t.   \n\nTo close the wound I used plain old super glue (the gel kind) instead of a suture.  The important thing when it comes to using glue is to try to keep your surgical field as bloodless as possible.  This is also helpful when positioning the implant within the incision.  I did this by applying a tourniquet after the anesthetic and compressing my finger to remove as much blood as I could before cutting it.   As you can see in the video I only ended up losing two little drops of blood for the entire procedure.\n\n**AFTERCARE**\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with the ease of aftercare.  Pain was minimal, and the implant stopped aching completely after about 12 hours. By 24 hours I was able to type normally and touch the finger gently without discomfort.  As long as it was protected from bumps and whacks the incision itself was not painful at all after that. I was pick up paper clips or flip the implant with a strong external magnet with little irritation.  There was a bit of stiffness in the injection site at the base of the finger.  I only felt it when making a fist though, and that went away within about a week.\n   \nWhile there was not much pain, there was a period of a couple weeks that were dominated by a very itchy “gross” sensation.  It’s the feeling of flesh stretching around a foreign object in the body much like a huge splinter, or food stuck in your teeth, or an overripe pimple.  It’s not exactly painful, but it doesn’t feel good either.  Overall though I’d say this implant was definitely much less traumatic than most body piercings, especially the tongue or nipple.\n \n**COMPLICATIONS &amp; REMOVAL**\n\nI did have a couple of issues with the implant during healing.  First, a couple of weeks after the incision had healed the top layer of skin died and came off around the implant.  What was left underneath was smooth shiny and red like new skin after a burn.  I was not able to determine whether that was a result of the implant or the superglue, but I suspect the superglue it only occurred in areas where the glue had been. In any case it didn’t cause any pain, and the skin eventually went back to normal.\n \nThe second issue came from me playing with the implant before it had healed completely.  I could not resist playing with external magnets during the healing process. They created a very interesting sensation as the implant would align itself with the magnetic field under the skin.  One day I absentmindedly let a tiny yet strong neodymium magnet get too close, causing the implant to come out of its pocket and start to rupture the incision from the inside.\n  \nThe result was that one edge of the implant was visible just beneath my skin as it sat half in and half out of the sub-dermal pocket.  I tried to reposition it by sucking it back into its pocket with a more powerful magnet, but it would not stay in position long enough to re-heal.  It probably would have been ok like this but I didn’t like being able to see the implant under my skin, nor did I want to risk rejection, so I removed it.  Unfortunately I never healed to the point where I was able to sense EM fields beyond the static ones created by powerful magnets.\n\nRemoval was much easier than implantation.  I did not use anesthetic and since I could see the implant under the skin I knew exactly where to cut.  I was able to keep the incision to just a millimeter or two by lining it up with the edge of the implant that was visible.  It leapt onto the scalpel on its own. This only took a couple of minutes and I didn’t need more than a simple Band-Aid afterwards.\n \n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nOverall I was very pleased with the outcome of my procedure.  There are a couple of things I would change though.  In the future I would take the time to acquire a suture set and close the incision with a stitch instead of using super glue.  The glue works, but a suture would have been cleaner, healed faster, and likely would have avoided the skin peeling issue.  \n\nSecondly I would be stricter with myself and avoid playing with the implant for as long as possible while it is healing.  I knew the danger and I was generally very careful, but all it took was a moment of inattention for me to mess up.  I think I would need at least 2 or 3 months of healing before getting near any external magnets, especially neodymiums, just to be safe. \n\nFinally I would be more careful with my sterilization and sterile field techniques.  I was lucky that nothing went wrong and I didn't have any complications with infection, but I made a number of mistakes that could have easily led to that.  \n  \nI still have the implant in my sock drawer and plan to re-implant it someday when inspiration strikes.  I do have some concern that the scar tissue from the procedure would impede future sensitivity if I were to use that site again, so I’m just trying to decide if I want to put it in the same spot or choose a different finger altogether.\n",
