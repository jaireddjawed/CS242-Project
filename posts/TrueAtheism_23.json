Do most Muslims agree that Isis is bad? \nMainstream media makes it hard to know. It kinda throws it all under one group of people- leading to racism. \n\nIsis is like a cult that gives being a Muslim a bad name? \n\nJust like I don't know anything about this topic, I see why the cult grew so large- they were taught by parents since being a kid?

        "text": "To give some background: I grew up in a secular household. I did not even go to church until I was in high school. I felt that the majority of the things taught in church were dogmatic, contradictory, and seemed oppressive. Its like I inherently know its man-made bullshit.  At the same time, I was growing up in an extremely dysfunctional and abusive household. I don't really want to go into too much detail with this but basically my mother was an alcoholic and she turned into a different person. \n\nI had no self esteem growing up. I didn't have any friends. My only outlet was studying and doing well in school. I also thought as soon as I got into college, I would get away from my family, get some friends, and overall be happier.\n\nI got into a good school. I did make some friends. I was happier for about the first year. Then, I started to become depressed again. I started thinking about killing myself everyday. I got so close as getting the extension cord to hang myself with and planning on my last day. Although, right before I did, for some reason I felt compelled to go to church. I went and I can't deny that going probably saved my life. The people there took me in with open arms and were happy to see me. It felt different then the first church I went to, they actually seemed to care about me. It felt like for the first time in my life I was accepted and loved for just being me. \n\nThe only problem is I just can't believe what they teach. I just think that fundamentally its wrong and theres no truth in laying claim in the Bible is the direct word of God. I don't know what to do because I feel good going but it totally goes against my beliefs (or lack thereof). \n\nI was wondering if you guys had any (serious) advice on what to do.",

        "text": "One of the most common things I see here and in /r/atheism is users calling out Christians for picking and choosing what laws to follow. For example, we don't force rape victims to marry their rapists any more so that is an example of selective reading of the Bible.\n\nI strongly disagree with this take. Christians have a point when they say that these need to be looked at in context. These were laws given SPECIFICALLY to the Israelites after (allegedly) escaping slavery in Egypt. These were never mandates for every single person.\n\nWhether you agree with this or not, it is the common response you'll get from Christians who are even mildly educated or well-read, and I believe there are better ways to bring up these barbaric laws. To me, the problem isn't that Christians don't follow these laws. The problem is that at ONE POINT IN TIME, God thought that these were the best possible solutions to the problems of rape, working on the Sabbath, disobedient children, etc.\n\nSo often we hear about the poverty of atheism due to the lack of objective morality, but what objective morality does God provide? It seems to me that all the \"big objective morals\" like murder, rape, slavery, etc., were violated by his commands in Leviticus  and Deuteronomy. He clearly is not a source of any type of objective morality as according to the Bible he is unchanging and he has also given these mandates for murder, rape, theft, etc.\n\nI guess to sum it up, don't waste your time pointing out that these laws aren't followed today. Most people have some Biblical reason that they don't follow these and it is fruitless to point it out. Instead, I believe it would be more productive to use these as examples of the fallibility of God's character and the supposed objective morality that he provides.",

I am currently a high school student living with my parents and they are both devout Lutheran Christians, in the most conservative branch. My parents still think that I am also a devout Christian as I am too afraid and scared for my mental health and living situation to tell them that I don't care what their God says. I go to church every Sunday very consistently unless I make an expensive or important commitment, and I attend Sunday School and occasionally acolyte. In addition to being atheist, I am also bisexual and the church my parents have us attend is staunchly anti-gay.\n\nSince I have begun learning about other religions, atheism, pro-LGBT things, and various other liberal viewpoints (breaking away from the indoctrination) I have found it harder and harder to force myself into acting like I actually believe any of what the church is teaching. For example, this morning I was at the point of crying because I did not want to go to church.\n\nAll of the religious things I am made to attend have been bearable in the past in part because there were some interesting people at church who I like to talk to and I enjoy the sense of community. Recently, the people I liked talking to have gone off to college or work and don't attend my church anymore. A few people joined the church but they are home-schooled and don't know anything outside of the Christian religion.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or tips for handling this? Telling my parents I don't believe what they do is not an option for me.",

It turns out it was just a PR stunt to make the church look like they have no ill will towards gay people.\n\nThe real opinion of the Mormon church is that gay people are so awful that they can't even accept their straight kids.\n\nHere is their possible reasoning: Children of polygamist parents have had this same rule for a long time. Side note - most polygamists are NOT fringe cultists wearing old-timey clothes; the majority of Mormon polygamists are actually blended into society and you would never know it if you met them. Kids that grow up in a polygamist home see their parents as humans who love each other. These children are dangers to mainstream Mormonism, which abandoned polygamy after being forced by Congress and the Supreme Court. They are dangerous because they don't see polygamists as monsters.\n\nSame with children of gay parents. They don't see their parents as pedophilic, fire-breathing monsters. They see them as a loving couple who raised them.\n\nAnd that makes you the worst kind of person, according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

If yes, then there had to be a single moment in our evolutionary past, probably a major mutation (explainable by the anthropic principle), when two \"soulless machines\" gave birth to a subjective observer. Is this a common thought? If no, where did I make a mistake?\n\nSo, the argument goes like this.\n\n1) An organism is either a subjective observer or no, tertium non datur.\n\n2) Humans are subjective observers, and at least our very ancient ancestors like say proto-cells aren't.\n\n3) Therefore, in the evolutionary sequence from non-observers (say proto-cells) to observers (us) there had to be a specific moment when non-observer parents gave birth to a child that is an observer - i.e. a major brain wiring mutation, similar but more profound to how there was milk-digestion mutation when the first ever lactose-tolerant person was born, or anything like that.\n\n4) Pointing out when exactly this happened requires extra considerations. But assuming this is done, it follows that\n\na) there can be two very similar organisms, yet one of them is an observer and another isn't;\n\nb) namely every organism down from this division line is a thing, and every one up is an observer.\n\nDid I mess something up? Any ideas?\n\nEdit: here is another summary: My point is that there is either any subjective experience at all or no. I don't see how this is possible to deny. The sequence of generations is discrete and since there are finitely many neurons their firings are discrete as well. So there is a literal first moment of subjective experience ever - there is gotta be. Otherwise, it has been forever, i.e. you believe in God :)",

I've read a few books, including The God Delusion and have watched countless debates. However, I can't help but to find myself pretty overwhelmed and ignorant of opposing arguments and even the arguments and supporting evidence for simple things like atheism in general and evolution. It's a pretty scary thing to admit.\n\nThis isn't all to say I don't understand the fundamentals. I just find myself perusing sites like [this] (https://answersingenesis.org/) with very little to say to myself as I read it. Quite frankly, it's just a whole lot of work that overwhelms me when I really get into reading.\n\nMy main problem, again, is supporting evidence. We hear things in debate like how there's mountains of research out there supporting evolution and none reasonably denying it. I believe that, and the evidence I have seen is convincing, but I still don't feel like I'm doing much more than repeating what I've read. \n\nSo my question to anyone more knowledgeable than me out there is this: is there a compliment to Answers in Genesis for Atheists? I'm looking for similar articles with sources to back up it's information. In addition, if there's some sort of ~~magic~~ evolutionary website out there designed around countering their arguments, that'd be cool.",

But then I thought it would be more interesting if I posted here instead. My initial thought was that **\"most atheists have some issue with polyamory\"**. However, I'm skeptical I can make that case. There aren't polls of atheists specifically on this topic. What does exist is polling on whether polyamory is morally acceptable, with religiosity as a variable. I'm also not convinced morality is the same as support. The data is from [YouGov](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/bz9id6ab5c/tabs_OPI_Poly_20150730.pdf).\n\n\n\n\nStance | Male | Female | No Religion in Life | A Little Religion | Religion is Somewhat Important| Religion is Very Important|\n|---|---|----|----|---|---|---|\nMoral | 36% | 16% | 58%  |43 % | 18%| 9|\nImmoral | 48% | 64% | 17%  |31%| 61%| 80%|\nDon't Know| 16% | 20%| \n|**Percent Population**| 50| 50| 17%| 16% | 28% | 39%\n\n-------------\n\nThere are a few problems with both claims (most atheists support/don't support).\n\n1. Does morality of polyamory equivalent to having no problem with it?\n(Ex. it's not immoral to play the lotto, but public policy shouldn't encourage it)\n\n2. Do self-defined atheists differ from our \"Religion is Unimportant\" group? \n\n3. Are base rates of gendered support different among such atheists?\n\n4. If not, can we meaningfully say \"most atheists have no problem\", if 65% of female atheists say it is immoral?\n\n\nI'll stop here. I'm interested to know what your thoughts are. \n\nEDIT: Fixed an error on the chart.

        "text": "I was casually scrolling through my Facebook feed this evening only to stumble across a post containing C.S. Lewis' \"Reasoning\" against Atheism. Too often, I see Christians praising C.S. Lewis as some kind of apologetic genius, a true intellectual defender of the logical soundness of Christianity. I attended a Christian High School growing up and as such, my philosophy professor fawned over Saint Lewis' apologetic arguments and promoted \"Mere Christianity\" as a book that would quell my doubts about Christianity. If you've read Mere Christianity before, you're probably already beginning to cringe just thinking about this dilapidated disaster of an apologetic argument. *Deep breath* Alright, here goes:\n\n“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”\n—C.S. Lewis\n\nTry not to punch your computer screen and bear with me, I'm gonna try to break this down. \n\nLuckily, reality is not dependent on belief. Belief is also not necessarily dependent on reality and while these two things can coexist, there is not always a direct correlation between these two things. Reality is the independent variable and belief is somewhat of a dependent variable, sometimes functioning as an independent one. C.S. Lewis thinks that his beliefs have a direct effect on his reality, claiming that he chooses to believe in God because it means that he isn't merely an evolved ape spewing nonsense. Well, Lewis, that's where you're wrong. In Lewis' proposed scenario, there are 4 distinct possibilities:\n\nPossibility A: Your brain evolved and you believe in Evolution.\nPossibility B: Your brain evolved and you believe in Creation.\nPossibility C: God designed your brain and you believe in Creation.\nPossibility D: God designed your brain and you believe in Evolution.\n\nLet's just ignore the mountains of evidence for Evolution and play along with Lewis' mental gymnastics for a bit and beat him at his own game. In both Possibility A and B, our brains have evolved and one cannot be 100% certain of the validity of our logical conclusions. I would agree with this statement, because if this were not true, we wouldn't have people across the world worshiping a host of various imaginary friends. If everyone were correct, there would be no political, scientific, or religious discourse. It is also very possible that through the process of natural selection, our brains have developed to the point that we can discern reality and use spatial reasoning, solve logical problems, and that we have the capability of abstract thought. Having an evolved brain does not imply that we are wrong, or incapable of being right, it simply means that its not a \"perfect\" system. \n\nHowever, this is where it gets interesting. Let's assumed God did design our brains like in Possibility C and D. Lewis assumes that God creating his brain solves the problem of coming to incorrect conclusions. He believes that if God created his brain, it must be more reliable than one that evolved. However, look at the world we live in. Assuming that we are, in fact, \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" and that our brains are God's pet project, we still have to rationalize the presence of mental disorders and the fact that people are unable to reach consensus on just about any topic. This also raises further soteriological questions regarding the presence of other faiths and religions. Why would God intentionally design our brains to be dysfunctional and to deny his very existence? This brings us to possibility D. This is a question that haunted me when I was still a Christian and began doubting my faith. Why would a loving God who could design me in any way he saw fit, design me to doubt his very existence? If he were to give me the ability to think rationally and use logic, how could rationality and logic be used against him? We can only assume that God designs the brains of non-believers, knowing beforehand that they will be incapable of belief, kept back from the pearly gates of heaven by pesky logic. This makes possibility C look even more ridiculous. God intentionally designs our brains and yet only a handful of us are capable of thinking rationally, let alone choosing the right religion. This sounds like faulty design on God's part. \n\nEven if C.S. Lewis believes God created our brains, it makes them no more trustworthy or any less unreliable than they currently are. \n\n\"...if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”\n\nLewis, using your own logic, you also can't trust arguments leading to Theism. Ultimately, being created by God is irrelevant to your logic. By simply observing human nature, one can conclude that the brain is a faulty instrument that leads people to make faulty conclusions. In my opinion, believing that an omnipotent, omniscient God created an intentionally flawed instrument that sends people to hell is much more troubling than accepting Evolution. \n",

Kind of gives me the worst of both worlds, a non-submissive Christian wife :).\n\nSo this is about NUMBERS 5:11-22 and came about when I said that chapter was a 'recipe for abortion'.  She's extremely well-read and can usually destroy me on a Biblical fight but she was flummoxed with this chapter which she'd never thought about before.  She didn't answer me that night and several days later gave me this response:\n\nSo, you brought this up last week (I think?).  As promised, I looked into the matter, consulting a PhD student, who consulted another PhD who is an expert in ancient Judaism and the New Testament.    The verses in question point to a cultural issue well documented in ancient times which was often perilous to women:  unproven allegations of adultery.  The Jews, as Scripture and history attests, were not exempt from the cultural and social influences of those around them and God often made concessions for the errors of their times.  \n\nIt is important to understand that these verses contextually are not about abortion.  They are about accusations of adultery without proof.  Women had no rights in these times and were at the mercy of their husbands or fathers.  Of paramount importance to women of those times was their ability (or inability) to bear children.  The reasons for this was manifold, but among them were to secure her future.  Thus making the threat of miscarriage and a cursed womb anathema to a woman.   We are not speaking of a woman seeking the termination of a child, nor of a woman who is even in need of such a “solution.”    It is an issue of jealousy, which imperils the woman.   Also of note, this judgment is the Lord's to make.  As punishment, God was known to \"close the womb\" several times in Scripture.  \n\n According to Dr. **SOME GUY SHE KNOWS** (aforementioned expert) the Hammurabbi code addressed this exact issue with the difference being that the accused woman was to drown herself in the river.  A clear lose-lose situation for the woman.  In contrast, God allowed for a “test” – which if you read carefully is water and dust – (not known abortifacients) – in order to satisfy a primitive mind and act as protection for the woman falsely accused.  You may remember that jealousy is a sin to God, so perhaps the ridiculousness of the situation here outlined is His way of highlighting the fact.  I don’t know.  What I do understand is God’s kindness in dealing with us where we are – even though where we are is usually ass backward.  Most of the words in this diatribe are mine.  I reference Dr. **SAME GUY** for the Hammurabbi information and I will reference **some friend** (soon to be Dr. **some friend**) for saying that the idea that this is an “abortion text” is a result of  “our 20th century context trying to read something into the text.” \n\nHope this helps....\n\nI am still working on a reply but this is what I have so far:\n\nI’ve never understood the thought that ‘ancient times were perilous to women’ argument and that’s why the Bible is so misogynistic.  The world was ‘perilous to women’ *because* the Bible made it that way.  In ancient times God was very hands-on.  He brought plagues, destroyed cities, even destroyed civilization and all life on earth but for a family and, reportedly, and two of each ‘kind’ of animal in order to get things how He wanted them.\nA city is too sinful?  Destroy it!  An individual is too sinful?  Kill them.  Someone touches the case that holds these laws?  Dead!  On the spot.  But somehow misogyny was something too big for God to tamp out.  Or more likely didn’t wish to tamp out.\nEarly civilization was certainly misogynistic but it was in large part due to religion.  As it is today.\nGod had a lot to say about cattle thieves, isolating women on their period and which fabrics were acceptable to wear together.  Lots of talk about eating shellfish, working on a Saturday and how to speak His name.  Much less on ‘treat women as equal to men’.\nSteal a person’s livestock?  Punished by death.  Rape a woman?  You have to marry her.  Couldn’t God have written an 11th commandment stating “Thou Shall Not Rape”?  Or is 10 a perfect number?  According to the Bible if a young woman is raped and doesn’t disclose it, she’s to be PUT TO DEATH if she marries someone else and they find out.  \nI think you are correct in saying that the verses in question point to a cultural issue.  The contention being that they were written in a certain cultural context that should no longer be followed.  I do not think we should follow moral advice from selected written works from a bronze-age nomadic tribe.  Whether it is on issues related to women, abortion, homosexuality, slavery or any issue.  Our morals should come from what prospers and furthers a civil society.  \nYou are correct in writing that the verses we talked about are not about abortion.  They are actually bigger than terminating a pregnancy.  They are about women’s role in not only the household but in society.  And like in the Hammurabi code you referenced, OT women are losers either way.  So what if the ‘recipe for abortion’ was no more than dust and water.  Didn’t Jesus heal blindness with mud?  If the OT is to be taken literally and each ‘remedy’ is a miracle than it still would have worked to abort a baby.  However that sets aside the fact that it’s ‘bitter, holy water’.  And the dust was from a tabernacle floor.  \nWhere is there a similar verse about a man cheating on his wife?  When does his lover’s child die in utero?  It seems the mental gymnastics needed to think the Bible is the inerrant word of God and that God deems women equal to men is staggering.\n\n\n  \n",

The only problem with that is if a delusion expands to a great enough group of people, it will undoubtedly affect my life and most other people's. So it becomes necessary to negate any uprising backed by superstitious beliefs. Or at least make sure it's not implemented in a government.\n\nIf you knew someone suffering from a mental impairment (delusional, schizo, OCD) would you try to help them or just be \"tolerant\" of their sickness? Is it not a responsible thing to do to try and help people who are sick? It's very arguable that most religions fall under these categories. Whether it's *actually* believing in imaginary things (delusional) or becoming entangled in spiritual rituals (OCD), it's seemingly not moral to turn a blind eye to the situation. Just because mental illness has \"religion\" stamped on it doesn't make it something else.\n\nI was like a lot of atheists, living my life and being tolerant of such delusions, but lately I've seen that it is actually necessary to oppose religion rather than go along with it. At least try to lead people to reason. It's socially irresponsible to not try and bring reason and maturity to the world you live in.",

        "text": "When I reveal to people that I am an atheist, the usual reaction nowadays has moved from shock to an examination of my motives. I am no spring chicken, but the default move--and this from people who haven't set foot in a church, temple, synagogue, or compound in decades, mind you--is to press for details about against whom I am rebelling. This is the method of contentless, casual dismissal that seems to be in vogue in my circles of late. It is amusing to me, that many of these people wouldn't lift an eyebrow if I tattooed a Hitler mustache on my upper lip. That would be a personal choice after all. But to claim the title of atheist requires they engage their two semesters worth of psychology classes in the interest of explaining this madness.\n\nAnd atheism is something that I, as an atheist, an agnostic as well, care very little about at all. It is such a pointless burden to heap upon oneself. But I feel it is necessary. To me, atheism is a mere consequence of other, more important beliefs. Beliefs that I share for the most part with people who think that publicly accepting \"atheism\" is like declaring a love for Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il and Stalin. So I have taken a different approach when these topics come up. I establish commonalities first and I start from what is really important to me, and I rarely even get to the big Scarlet \"A\" that is atheism.\n\nI am a naturalist. I believe for reasons that I have read and agreed with, and others can explain better than I can, that there is a natural world and only a natural world. That anything that is mysterious is merely nature we do not understand, perhaps even nature that we can not understand. With the exception of concepts like the logical absolutes and mathematical derivations, if something is perceivable or comprehensible it is natural. There is no \"supernature.\" If something akin to supernature intrudes upon nature, then it ceases to be supernature and becomes plain, ordinary, testable, verifiable, falsifiable nature.\n\nAll claims about untestable, unverifiable, non-falsifiable \"supernature\" are equally valid as we *have no way of testing them.* Therefore, claims about supernature are inherently worthless.\n\nI am a skeptic. To me, this means that I believe that science as we have developed it (and will continue to refine it) is the best collection of tools we have for distinguishing between what is real and what is not. Additionally, I believe that logic is an essential tool for analyzing claims. And that this means that making a claim about reality is to accept the burden of proof for that claim.\n\nIt is only after all that (and a lot of it is open for debate, and I am not particularly good at debating it) am I anywhere near to discarding God claims. I just think it follows quite naturally from the above that there is no God. But if someone wants to claim that there is one, then this follows: prove it. And that is typically where ridiculous claims of unknowable-knowledge and untestable tests and unfalsifiable truths begins. That is if I am speaking to a Theologian... the only types of people who are willing to engage the interlocking dictionary definitions that are necessary to create such klugey, monstrous \"Gods.\" Almost everyone else is content with \"spirituality,\" \"nature is my good,\" \"people are good... that's my religion,\" or \"I believe there's a force... or I mean... an energy... yeah... that permeates us, binds us, that suffuses all life throughout the galaxy...\"\n\nSo, given all that, I wonder *what is a religion?*\n\nMany must have studied this. But I am not aware of a general, abstract \"Theory of Religion\" on par with something like a \"Theory of Economics.\" Doubtless, there are many, but it never seems to pop up in my life. We are satisfied with tradition and various sniff tests. We know what religion looks like. We know it when we see it. And this is very unsatisfying to me. As I first pass, I am willing to say, that from my point of view at least, religion is a system of beliefs that permits people to make knowledge claims about unknowable aspects of supernature. And then, further, to claim that they aren't making a claim. And that for some reason the claim is not subject to testing, falsifiability, examination, or even criticism. The last few bits are really just defenses. The core of religion seems to me to be only the claim of somehow knowing that which can not be known.",

That takes tremendous weight off my own shoulders, and it also brings with it a great sense of relief.

        "text": "My thought is this. God after all is a highly metaphysical question, ultimate origins and so on. We can only easily say definitely that there is no evidence or reason to suggest that that the answer to the question \"why electrons etc follow all those equations, the laws of nature - what *makes* them do it?\" or \"why is there something rather than nothing?\" is \"Jesus's love\". In fact, that's not how it works *qualitatively*, by inductive inference; nature works automatically  - apples do not *decide* to fall, and it is an arbitrary assumption that what *makes* these things happen does so by *decision*.\n\nAnyway this is all very philosophical, but on the other hand the question of non-existence of afterlife - that the brain runs the mind - is backed by solid repeatable medical/physiological evidence (all those traumas/deficiencies/split brains/drug influence/Alzheimers etc) and common sense observation. Suppose someone hits me on the head - I have a concussion; suppose the hit is even stronger - I lose consciousness for some time, the stronger, the longer; suppose it's even stronger (e.g. smashing my head completely) - I lose consciousness as well as the ability to come back to it. That is simply what we call \"death\". There is just no *logical space* for afterlife, unlike there is at least *logical space* for God; plus all the massive rigid repeatable medical evidence, not paralleled by anything with respect to the question of God per se. So this seems like an easy knock-down attack on religion, easier than arguing against God directly. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEdit: Clarification - the \"soul\" is of course supposed to be *the subjective you per se*, the same guy/gal reading these words, not believing in Jesus/Allah and who will be made suffering in Hell for that :) So on the \"brain as soul-world connection device\" idea you'd be basically playing a computer game like \"Matrix\" (not only audiovisually but also with all other feelings) - now, you can get injured or paralyzed but you can't get drunk, knocked *unconscious*, or get Alzheimer's etc in a computer game!

I heard you could feed so many people or like take homeless people out of homelessness or something with that taxed money\"* I know exactly what he means. Anyway this kind of piqued my curiosity of where he stands on religion or gods and he said *\"all that shit is stupid\"* And I just laughed. \n\nArriving at the abandoned houses, he starts to get freaked out about ghosts and talks about having heard footsteps in past experiences. Obviously being in an abandoned house is pretty spooky, but he was properly spooked with the idea of ghost encounters. I just said *\"man only way I'll believe in ghosts is if one comes up to me and gives me a lapdance\"*, we both laughed and all he said was *\"I don't know man I've had some weird shit happen to me that I can't explain at all\"* and that's how that discussion ended. \n\n\nI know that normally you *hear* or *experience* odd things when you have your fear exploited and your mind likes to play tricks or if you do actually hear anything that your brain tries to find an answer for the occurrence as fast as possible, which can be faulty and so on and so forth. I'm not going to argue with him about it or anything, besides it's pretty much half the excitement of exploring abandoned places, but I want this to kind of spur a discussion about the relationship between believing in ghosts and not believing in deities, even if ghosts can be placed in a relatable supernatural category as god(s) .\n\nAll experience is welcomed! Would love to hear feedback on this. ",

On the other hand we do observe precisely such a formal program - what's called laws of nature.\n\nIn fact, the absolute ultimate must be changeless, otherwise it's not absolute and not ultimate. And a mind, disembodied or not, makes decisions etc, which require inner change. So it's not God whatever it is. (While a formal set of rules of nature is just fine with this test.)\n\n2) More important - refutation of contingency argument (why electrons follow the laws of physics etc; what makes them do it?)\n\nFormal mathematical laws of arithmetic necessarily entail that 2+2=4 (or Fermat's Last Theorem), right? Formal mathematical laws of geometry necessarily entail that cubes have eight vertices and medians intersect in a single point, correct? And formal mathematical laws of nature necessarily entail that the sun shines and you are reading these words right now, agreed?\n\nSo what do you [the question is to an apologist] find unclear or requiring explanation? All these truths are necessary truths (even if they are hard to demonstrate/derive explicitly, like Fermat's last theorem or you reading this); or, another way to put it, any chain of Why?-Why?-Why?-... ultimately ends in \"by definition\".\n\n\nThoughts/ideas/opinions?",

This led me to search for some kind of quick elevator pitch that could help me make an argument for my lack of belief, which developed into a process of creating a response of my own which resembles a riddle of sorts. \n\nGod is supposedly Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Good. If He is Good and Omnipotent, yet evil exists, he must be unaware of it, thus not Omniscient. If He is Good and Omniscient, yet evil exists, he must be unable to stop it, thus not Omnipotent. If He is Omnipotent and Omniscient, yet evil exists, he must not be Good. \n\nTypical Response: Yeah, but evil exists because we have free will and because Adam and Eve disobeyed God, allowing sin to enter the world.\n\nAdam and Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The Knowledge of Good and Evil is the ability to make informed moral decisions. God's commands are good, and disobedience of God is the definition of evil. When God commanded them not to eat of the fruit, he gave them a moral command. However, until eating of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, Adam and Eve were incapable of making a moral decision (obeying God), as they lacked the knowledge of good and evil. \nIt is also incorrect to say that free will cannot exist without evil, as Adam and Eve were able to use free will to make the decision to eat of the fruit, as evil entered the world only afterwards. \n\nThoughts or recommendations?",

Also, I would say for the most part that religious/theistic friends/acquaintances of mine are pretty much just regular, mentally healthy people who happen to differ on some core beliefs.\n\nThe people I actually am concerned about are those who either talk in person or on social media about what God wants/thinks/feels about things. Essentially people who are 100% convinced that they speak for God and that God speaks to them. I don't think for a second the majority of these people are lying, consciously or not, and that they are sincere. For the sake of argument, let's say there is a god out there, everyone is contradicting each other but equally convicted they are hearing from the same deity. It comes off very delusional and seems very close to mental illnesses of hearing voices or having hallucinations.\n\nI find it very scary, sad, and frustrating. It's scary because these people are praised, encouraged, and validated by their peers constantly. People will listen to them and take them seriously. A pastor of a church can stand up in front of a congregation talk about what the lord \"spoke\" to him and he will have everyone agreeing with him. A pastor next door can say something contradictory, have the same conviction, and receive the same response. On top of this, I don't know a Christian who isn't convinced they can differientiate between who genuinely speaks for god and who is false. It's one massive delusional mess.\n\nIt's sad to me seeing this just like it's sad seeing someone with schizophrenia, depression, or any other mental illness, but frustrating because there's no way to help. You can't help someone who 1) doesn't think they have a problem or 2) isn't willing to help themselves.\n\nI hope this doesn't all sound like pretentious bullshit, that I feel mentally superior to the majority of the population, that's not what I'm trying to convey. I genuinely get the impression the people I described suffer from mental illness/brainwashing, and I doubt that's a thought unique to me. So I'm curious if people out there have done more research and have more insight on the matter. Are there any documentaries, videos, essays, books about this I could check out?

        "text": "As far as I see, an important argument of atheists is this: If God is used to explain \"Why there is the existence rather than  nothing\", then this god would add some more conditions, and would make things even more complicated, not simpler. And according to Occam's razor, this is not reasonable.\n\nMy question is this: Can I not design something even more complicated than myself? For example, I can easily imagine a line with infinite number of points, while there are finite number of neurons or atoms in my brain. And I can design a computer which does much more complicated things than I can do. Or one day maybe I can develop something which has sentience.\n\nFurthermore, the infinite number of points in the above line, coming together by chance and displaying a certain function by chance requires much more coincidence than my brain (assuming that intelligence and sentience are physical things) existing before those points and creating many such lines or other complicated shapes or things.\n\nIf this point cannot be refuted, then OR would be more in favor of a Creator, rather than everything appearing by chance.\n\nAn objection to the above may be: If there is such a Creator at the beginning, then it has to have a minimum amount of neurons (they do not need to be neurons as we have of course, because they are just consisting of physical stuff whatever it is, so a stuff differentiated in a certain way may theoretically generate what our intelligence generates). And from where would they come?\n\nBut the point here is that if the more complicated can arise and actually arises from less complicated (if the complicated can increase) conditional to the existence of a kind of mindlike existence, then when we proceed towards past, there would be in any case a minimum of mindlike existence -possibly one- because of backwards infinite regress necessarily stopping at a minimum since we have the actual existence).\n\nAnd if what we observe is contingent, and if contingent requires a necessary, then there is no reason to reject that this initial generator is the candidate to be the necessary. (If the above reasoning is true, then according to OR we have to adopt it rather than assuming that things are related due to chance and surpassed the probability barriers without any systematic basis).\n\nThe above does not reflect my ultimate beliefs, but is an example to show that less complicated but mindlike/sentient existent may generate more complicated things according to OR and according to probabilistic calculations.",

I finally had a discussion about this with my father, who is a fundamentalist (or literalist, idk which is the proper term) who believes that every word of the bible is literally the word of god exactly as he intended. He went to seminary school and knows the bible better than I currently do, so I was not trying to debate him but simply asking questions. Here are some of the questions, to which I would appreciate answers from you guys with any relevant sources provided so I can do my own research and have something concrete to show him.\n\nTheological questions all brewed down to essentially the same answer: we are too limited as humans to understand god, so any question of his morality or methods is pointless. This was the response when I asked him why god regularly created people for the express purpose of torturing them forever, why god would allow slavery, why god needs blood sacrifice, why god \"elects\" people (my father believes that salvation is god's choice and not even belief, as it says apparently somewhere in revelations about the book of life), etc. He even said that \"reason can't lead you to god; he has to draw you on his own\". Is there even any way to respond to that?\n\nScientific questions were answered mostly with \"the REAL scientists have conclusively proven that evolution is false, noah's flood happened, and that dna means intelligent design\". He outright said that Dawkins is less qualified as a scientist than himself (my father), that any scientist supporting evolutionary claims or an old earth doesn't understand relativity or is just lying, and that other civilizations which date further back than the flood are not reliable history because they don't have unified books that are congruent (like the contradiction-free bible, apparently). That last point was made when I asked why the collected history of the chinese, who were literate far before the merchant authors of the bible according to my current understanding, don't seem to mention being entirely wiped out by a flood. The answer was as I stated earlier; \"that's not real history because they don't have a congruent book\". \n\nSorry if this is a poorly formatted wall of text; I got very little sleep and quite honestly am still just as confused by some points he raised as you probably are reading this mess. Any help (especially with sources that I can research) would be greatly appreciated gearing towards any of these points. I already have \"A History of God\" on my reading list but classwork has pushed it down the priority row a bit and I'm still looking for a good book on evolution to read after that as my own understanding is limited. Thanks again for any help, I'll try to clarify any of your questions or elaborate on the points later when I return from work.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the replies. I'm quite busy with class this week and if I don't respond directly to you it's simply due to that, not because I'm ignoring anyone. I appreciate all the sources and I definitely have a lot to start learning now! ",

I got rid of my Facebook account largely because I couldn't stand to see the banal things people were sharing anymore and I decided to limit my social media to LinkedIn (although I guess this counts, doesn't it?). Recently I've been getting connection requests from people in the church I grew up in/escaped.\n\nThe church I was raised would probably be classified as a cult if it were just a touch more extreme or had fewer members. Or maybe it's simply because I was raised in it and my perspective is skewed, but I think it's *just* on the side of the size vs. crazy ratio to qualify as a church vs. a cult. Connection requests are from stay-at-home wives (not to be a jerk, but isn't LinkedIn for fostering professional connections?), someone calling themselves CEO when he does freelance computer support, and a pastor calling himself \"Dr.\" Alvin Smith (typical religious school from an unrecognized accrediting agency) and the \"CEO of Into-Africa\". Except having been a member of the church I know what they're really doing is building more churches- not clean water projects.\n\nDo I ignore or decline the requests because they're from people of questionable legitimacy or worth to me? Do I accept them because it's just LinkedIn and doesn't really matter? Or do decline them because I escaped that brain-washing (Christian Fellowship Ministries) and have no desire to ever associate with people from there again. Frankly, I think I'm too emotional when it comes to that church in particular (I had nightmares for months after I left) and don't know that I make rational decisions concerning my interactions with that entity.\n\nI'll gladly give more info if anybody wants, but I could really use some advice, feedback, or at the very least a sounding board.

All they care about is getting people behind their cause (in this case, bringing prayer back into schools), and they will exploit the victims of a school shooting in order to do it.\n\nThink of it this way: If the agenda pushed by this comic was replaced with a different one, [how would that look](http://imgur.com/p3RIF83)? It would not be accepted even for a second if a company used a tragedy like a school shooting in order to advertise their product. Why is it okay for a church to do the same?\n\nThat's why I hate it. Because it's a shameless, self-righteous person's attempt to push their agenda no matter who they have to step on in order to do it.\n\n[Bonus: I altered the comic to show just how absurd it should sound, even to a Christian.](http://imgur.com/Gbqt8du)",

        "text": "Hi, I'm an atheist who grew up in the church. Much of my family is still quite religious.  In conversing with some friends, I noted something I'd like to bring up here. \n\nThere are often questions about how to build community in absence of religion.  There are always good suggestions about philosophy/humanist clubs, social or hobby groups, etc. \n\nHowever, there is another kind of very personal interaction that goes on in some (good) christian small-group settings. \n\nSmall groups, when done right, provide a safe environment for vulnerability that you don't often find in secular societies. \n\nUS culture, in particular, is very bad about being vulnerable with people.  US status is all about bravado and positivity.  Rarely are people willing to open up and dig beyond the day-to-day pleasantries and polite conversation, even with long-time acquaintances and friends. \n\nWhat christian small groups sometimes get right is in creating a space where these walls can come down, and people can \"get real.\"  Talk about things they are struggling with, their emotions, their fears and worries.  \n\nOutside of seeing a therapist or making a BFF (which rarely happens in adulthood), there aren't many ways to do this in secular society. \n\nHas anyone out there found ways to address this very basic human need for open discussion of their inner life?

        "text": "For more on what this is about, [check out Week One](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3n5hie/week_one_atheist_in_a_christian_premarital_class/).  \n\n\nFirst of all, thank you to all the great responses and advice.  Week One’s session and homework (note: homework is not turned in) was about the biblical view of marriage and spent time focusing on how god defines marriage.  Relevant verses included (**Gen** 1:27-28 &amp; 2:24, **Matt** 19:3-9, 1 **Cor** 6:12-18, **Eph** 5:21-33, **Heb** 13:4, and **Matt** 19:6).  The homework was essentially a guided bible study through these verses.  Then it veered a little and asked us to share with our SO how/when we became a follower of Christ, how Christ impacted and transformed my life, etc.  As a former Christian, [I could actually answer these](http://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif).   Then it veered **again,** and asked the usual questions like “if you were to die tonight…how certain are you that you’ll go to heaven and why” along with “do you believe there is a way to heaven apart from JC”.  I think these are meant to be softballs that allow most couples to knock out of the park and bond over.  We, on the other hand, were enjoying popcorn in the stands as had some good discussions about vicarious atonement, emotive memes in Christianity, and what these questions had to do with marriage.  Safe to say, week one wasn’t the most helpful.  \n\nWeek two, however, had some good religious-agnostic information on how to successfully navigate communication and conflict (note: they did, however, find verses that could support these communication tactics, but they appeared much more descriptive than prescriptive).  They started by going over common communication and conflict resolution mistakes, including: \n\n* Thinking the primary goal of communication is to make sure you are heard\n* Not understanding the impact of words/tone\n* Assuming conflict ends when one says “I’m sorry”\n* Blaming your spouse as the reason you fight (James 4:1-2, btw)\n* Not ever taking a timeout\nThe “weenie” (W.E.N.I.) negative trait pattern which is: **Withdrawal/Avoidance**, **Escalation**, **Negative Interpretation**, and **Invalidation**.  For what it's worth, my SO identified with the W, and I personally found some parallels with E.  We both were N’s, but we’ve long since learned that that was most evident [when arguing via text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naleynXS7yo).  \n\nWeek Two’s homework basically asked couples to reflect on individual negative communication patterns along with what subjects/topics/circumstances typically catalyze fights.  It also asked us to analyze how our family of origin resolved conflict and whether it was something we would like to bring into our marriage.\nSo that’s it!  Stay tuned for Week Three which is on Biblical Roles in Marriage.  This should be good.",
