I not-so-smartly decided I would save some work for my babysitting experience and tried getting it done while putting on a movie for the kiddos.\n\nWelp. To say that this didn't work is an understatement lol.\n\nI'm on my laptop, and every 2 minutes: \"are you watching, uncle malachai926?\" \"yes I'm watching!\" \"are you still watching? I'm gonna do a dance, watch me uncle malachai926!\" Not to mention, the dog wanted to play fetch, and I made the mistake of throwing his toy once, after which he just never gave up getting me to throw the toy, which usually included dropping said slobbery toy directly onto my keyboard.\n\nThe clock mercifully struck 8:15, at which point I was finally able to utter those most glorious of words: \"time to get ready for bed!\" Which was a prolonged process of promising that their coloring books would not, in fact, simply vaporize overnight and would indeed still be there in the morning, followed by an epic quest for a pink stuffed bunny, without which my niece insists that she cannot sleep a wink, and after turning the house upside down for it, THEN the niece remembers, oh yeah, I put it in this bag today for no reason, here she is! Thank the heavens, she'll go to sleep after all.\n\nI finally sat down at the living room table to get my damn nearest shrunken centroids algorithm to converge, relieved that I finally had some peace and quiet.\n\n\"Uncle malachai926?????\"\n\nShit.\n\n\"Um, um, um, are you in the living room?\" \"Yes I'm here.\" Shortly after: \"Is momma home?\" \"No she's still at the opera.\" \"I really want momma to be home?\" (oh but not your brother, eh kiddo?! I happen to think he's a pretty swell guy!) \"I know sweetie, but you'll see her in the morning!\" \"Noooo I want momma home right now!\"\n\nSome reassurances had to be made that mom had not been engulfed by some horrible monster while ~~spending time away from the real one~~ going to the opera (I love my niece! Forgive me for choosing to make the joke that was *right there* for the taking) and that she would indeed come back home to her beloved daughter and everything would indeed be fine if she FE asleep without her mom home for a change. I should add, she's 6 years old, so this is hardly the first time she's had to deal with this.\n\nAnyway, the kids did indeed both fall asleep, and my nearest shrunken centroids did indeed converge, AND mom came home in one piece, and so did their dad! As little as the kids seemed to be concerned about him, for that matter. So all in all, a successful evening, I suppose. But I did note that in about 15 minutes of peace and quiet, I got done what I had been trying to get done for the past 3 hours.\n\nSo, parents, if I didn't already, I now have total respect for your ability to tackle grad school while having children at home. The fact that you can get anything done at home is nothing short of miraculous, in my mind.",

I just recently changed my major from environmental science after realizing I wanted to do work in analytical / physical sciences instead. I came to this realization when I enrolled in an introductory python course and fell in love with it. Easily my favorite class I’ve taken during my studies. I don’t want to change my major to computer science because a) that’s incredibly difficult to do at purdue, and b) I’m not interested in hardware. However, I am extremely interested in learning more about discrete math, graphics / geometry, scientific computing, numerical analysis, and theoretical computer science. \n\nThe programs I’ve been looking into thus far include mostly computational mathematics. A few of these programs are in the computer science department, but most have their own department or are through mathematics. In particular, I really like the scientific computing track through the computer science department at university of illinois (Urbana campus), the Purdue computational and applied mathematics center, and the university of Iowa applies mathematics and computational program (chemistry track). \n\nI’m wondering if this would be a good fit for me, and if it would be challenging for me to get accepted into such a program with my background. Should i change my major to mathematics instead and do a chem minor, instead of the chem major and math minor that I currently plan on pursuing? \n\nOther info: 3.99/4.00 overall GPA, research experience utilizing python to analyze chemical isotopes, and internship with analyzing chemical microanalyses. \n\nTLDR: I’ve changed my major too many times and don’t know if I am qualified to go to graduate school for a computational science doctorate.",

The author has a thesis about why something in the past happened, and he supports this claim with two new sources, both of which are intriguing but also problematic. So far I have an intro which states his thesis and explains that he has two new sources to present as evidence. I then have two paragraphs which describe each of his sources, and a summary of how he interprets them. My question is, should I do analysis of each source in those sections, or simply explain each of them there objectively, and then have a separate analysis section below?\n\nI ask because last semester I had feedback on a paper which said my analysis section was good but the entire paper should have been doing analysis along the way. I come from a science background (I did a BS in Chemistry then a BA in History 8 years later) where we normally lay out the problem, theory, experiments, findings, and analysis separately. I am not sure how to approach this in the humanities though. \n\nIf it matters, I go to one of the Russell Group schools in the UK and the professor who said I needed analysis throughout was an Oxford man thru and thru, so I kind of trusted his advice. But it seems like I ought to have a cogent analysis section separate. Any advice would be amazing!",

The question is that being in a field that is focuses more on applied and practical applications, how relevant is practical experience vs. theoretical experience for any program evaluating my profile for a PhD? Let me add some context to that:\n\n* Work experience at a company: I have the opportunity to work in the Summer on an AI-heavy project at a company. The project and the experience that they will provide is something that I am really interested in, and there is not too much of a learning curve to it as I already done have some personal projects related to it and will fit right in. \n* Work experience under a professor: On the other hand, a professor has also offered me the opportunity to do research under them for the summer. The area of research is still AI/ML related, but the field in which it is being pursued is not something I am too excited about, and it seems to be more of an academic position that involves a lot of researching and writing and possibly a publication, something that I am not as experienced at as opposed to practical implementation.\n\nKeeping in mind that I will begin my applications to programs in the Fall, which of these two opportunities would look better on my profile as a potential research candidate? In general, when considering a PhD, should I look for things that boost my profile on a theoretical basis than a practical basis?\n\nThank you so much for your time.",

But since then, I've taken four classes at a community college and got straight As in classes like environmental biology, statistics, plant and animal biology, and physical geography. I did a rigorous ecology internship associated with a university in the middle east dealing with ong term ecological research on multiple projects. I assisted in field work for someone's PhD work but completed none of my own papers. I did exceptionally well there and was put in charge of many of the projects. I then went to south Africa and did GIS work and tracking of lions and since then decided to become a field guide and have been guiding safaris for the past 8 months and I'll be here till September or maybe slightly longer if I can extend my visa this time around.\n\nI want to know what else I should do. I still don't think I've done enough to get into grad school. I've looked at doing a post bacc program like the one at Columbia (ecology evolution and environmental biology) or at OSU; is that worth it? Could it make me more competitive?\n\nUltimately, I really want a PhD in zoology or ecology, and I don't want my undergrad to ruin that for me for the rest of my life. \n\nI'm willing to work so hard I just need a chance to get in to show it.",

        "text": "Note: This will be a long, long post and my main question will be in the end if you'd like to skip to it. I am posting this here because IMO university and especially graduate school is a place where one gets exposed to variety of different people, perhaps for the first time, and therefore while the content of this post is not unique to graduate school alone, I am more than sure that what I write is not uncommon, as sad as it is.\n\n\n\n**Preamble**:  I am a second year grad student in pure mathematics and during the past academic year, the difference between my problem solving skills, ability to reason with new information and recall &amp; use already learned tools in a new and novel way, and those of my close colleagues in my graduate program's cohort has increased beyond a critical point (to be explained later). In my view what has happened is that I have not grown as much as a problem solver than my colleagues which combined with the fact that to this point, my only \"talent\" has been pain tolerance, has created a situation where the total time for me to solve a coursework problem has strictly increased per week, while it has remained the same for my said colleagues (to be expanded later).\n\n Before I dig deeper into this, explain what I mean by what, why I am feeling this way (i.e. why do I care about this) and what I would like to change, I have to point out the obvious: All my observations are purely anecdotal, as they always are in discussions like these. What I can say that the people I study with are some of the honest, open and morally sound students I have ever met in any situation. This is to say that I have no reason to believe that an overwhelming majority of the group I interact with would be dishonest or malicious in any way.\n\n\n\n With this out of the way,\n\n\n\n 1.) \"**Critical point?**\" Shortly: The total time  and external resources it takes me to finish coursework has grown so much within the last four months that I have started to become unhappy, detached and even less focused per day; something that builds up slowly over time. If something doesn't change within the next four to eight months I have a reason to believe that I will become depressed.  \t\t\t\n\nDetailed: During my studies so far, I have never been on the better side of the bell-curve when compared to other students in the same setting. So far I have had to endure the pain of having to spend more time for my assignments than my associates while knowing very well that my proofs/algorithms/code will be, in the end, mediocre. This just something I have observed during my undergrad and grad studies so far in subjects such as computer science, mathematics and physics. Moreover, due to not that great initiate problem solving and fluid intelligence, I have had to use more external resources to learn and accomplish the same task as other students.\n\n I would say that up to last October, this had all been something that I had managed to handle in one way or another. Up to that point the total time I had to spent was not so great that it would get under my skin. But ever since I have become slower and slower in terms of problem solving (as courses get more and more advanced), while all other students I know and interact with have managed to catch up to the increased level of difficulty. \t\t\t\n\n Currently the only reason why I am able to complete \\~ 80 % of the exercises in couple of my classes are due to the caring nature of the TAs. The general repeating story arc is that the exercises themselves have been handcrafted to maximize one's development (when done properly, i.e. with only the given reading material). I fail to understand how the given structures relate to the task at hand or I know that I want to achieve at a general level, but I am clueless on how I should even start to approach the right direction and more importantly, I (seemingly) don't have it within me to be able to make the small baby steps with which you solve the problem. I try my best but do not get anywhere (even with the possible hints we have been given) and I am resorted to ask more help from TAs.\n\n And the prior story can repeat itself multiple times per a problem, since because my TAs and classmates seem to see \\~ seven steps ahead when I see may be one or two, the advice I am given makes me even more confused to the point that I manage to scrape an answer/proof together somehow by asking enough hints (read: steps one should take) or I \"solve problems together\" with my class mates, sessions where I rarely, if ever, manage to contribute anything to the discussion. \t\t\t\n\n\n\n 2.) \"**My colleagues are not struggling?**\" I am not in any way saying that everyone else has it easy/I am the only one who studies outside the lectures/TA sessions. I am merely stating that the group of people I interact with have all taken the same classes for the past year and I have the least amount of personal responsibilities outside the classroom out of all of us (which is to say that I have more time available for the coursework and as of now, it is barely enough). And during this time the group I interact with is able to finish up their work in a reasonable amount of time, usually in the organized exercise sessions (or the very least the overwhelming majority figures out the main trick(s) for the exercises).\t\n\n\n\n 3.) \"**Why do I care if I am the slowest?\"** My experience so far has been that I am starting to be limited by my intelligence in a non-trivial way when I am not done with all my coursework. Moreover, since the problems themselves serve as a setting point for research and some of them are structured in such a way that even a freshman could in principle solve them, the frustration of have to be the dumbest of the class is soul crushing. But I am mostly concerned about this because if I struggle this much in a structured environment with the support of the course staff in problems that are well-defined and have known solutions, how am I to become a proper analyst/problem solver in the future, or alternatively at what cost? Being years behind your close peers development-wise is not fun. (Random ramble) And how do I know that it is years and not months? More than a few sophomores/juniors are taking the same classes (advanced real analysis, harmonic analysis, function analysis) than I, a second year master's student, and as far as the course material/problems are concerned, they could act as my personal tutor.\n\n\n\n 4.) \"**What I would like to see changing?**\" I would love to be able to somehow change my attitude towards this subject so that I would waste as little as possible of the time I have thinking about it. I somehow need to be able to accept the hard cold truth that I am quite possible the least intelligent person of my cohort. I understand that whether or not that is true (although there is quite a lot of evidence supporting the claim) will not in itself mean that I could not obtain a PhD in mathematics/eventually grow to be an expert in this or any other field. It would, however, mean that I will be able to complete less in the same amount, will probably have to make even more personal sacrifices in terms of personal life and that although you can learn quite a lot about any subject and you can ingrain a lot of known problem solving strategies, your IQ and fluid intelligence are something that you can really only maintain at their current level or decrease (e.g. TBI or extensive use of drugs and alcohol).\n\n\n\n **Question (also see the fourth point):** Can you suggest any concrete steps I should take? I have been thinking about contacting my school's psychologist, but am hesitant due to fact that I am a skeptic in nature, have had exhausting and counterproductive discussions on the \"growth mindset\" (I have met people who believed that Dweck's actually message is that IQ is a hoax and we all really have the same brain capacity since \"You work hard enough\" =&gt; \"You will succeed\" &lt;-&gt; \"You have not succeeded\" =&gt; \"You have not worked hard enough\") and I would like to discuss subject such as this with someone else who studies a subject as dividing as mathematics and has managed to overcome such a personal barrier.",

They have assignments and quizzes due on chapter 8, so we have to read the chapter and PowerPoint ourselves and do the assignments and quizzes. Then when we meet in class after turning everything in, they teach chapter 8. \n\nWhy not teach chapter 8 first and then have us do the assignments and quizzes?! I have reading comprehension issues so sometimes I don’t understand what I am reading and rely heavily on lectures and the ability to ask questions for me to understand concepts. So I end up getting bad grades and then after the lectures, getting upset because I now know what I messed up on. \n\nIs this normal for other programs?

When I was 19, I went to a university abroad because I thought American campus life was overrated and I wanted to do something different. It was *different* in that I had experiences that my friends here in the US can't relate to, even if they make for fun stories. While I was very young and still trying to figure out how to live, I was in a new country that spoke a different language and had totally alien (to me) cultural references. I didn't make many friends because I didn't know how, ended up dropping out, traveling around, working various places until I finally finished my degree last year as a commuter student.\n\nThere are a few reasons I want to go back to school, one being that I'd like to be a professor or teacher one day. The English program I'm applying to has a specialization in creative writing, which appeals to me because I want to hone my writing. The university is in a beautiful area with a lot of attractions. And finally, it's a resume reset after a tumultuous few years working random jobs and changing majors a lot. I've been in so many job interviews lately where I have to explain what the hell I've been doing the past few years and why.\n\nBut also... I just think it would be nice to live and work in that quirky, artsy environment and have *some* aspects of a college experience (not as if I'll be living in a dorm and eating at the dining hall, but still) for a couple years.

        "text": "(30M)- For the good part of the past two years my SO has been working on becoming a licensed pharmacist. Which is hard enough, but she had given birth to our firstborn immediately upon starting school. \n\nThere were some hard times off the bat for both of us, her dealing with PPD and us adjusting to parenthood whilst trying to get a handle on her studies. I also started a new career around the time she gave birth and for the first year there I had to be amenable to random schedule changes and lots of OT. \n\nOur kid would and does get sick quite often. Daycare constantly asks us to pick up our kid, so I’ve put a lot of stress on my job having to leave work or call in due to dependent leave. The childcare is affordable and the location is ideal, so I’m averse to switching for no promise of a better spot. I am shooting for FMLA to alleviate that headache. \n\nProblem is, her hours at school are so intense that for a while there I was falling into a destructive pattern, with nothing to do but watch our kid when I was not at work. Also I work night shifts so our time together is very limited. I discovered recently about a 2+ month long fling she had been having with a guy in her class. She had been abusing the time I let her study at school to be with him instead. Things never got all too serious with them, and when I found out she promised to break it off. \n\nFast forward to now, and she’s in a period where she’s absolutely overwhelmed by material and she’s sleeping less and getting more stressed. I had to set a limit of 12 hours a day at school for her. I give her weekends to go to school to study. I’m trying to be supportive and give her time to study but inside my insecurities are gnawing at me. There’s trust issues with her being at school so much, and I’ve brought this up to her. She’s brought up how this is making her feel trapped, and I worry that she feels I’m holding her back. I do not want to get in the way of her education, but it feels like the only way to keep her from feeling that way is by repressing my worries and putting on a brave face. I wish we would have known what we were getting into years ago.",

The only people I can think of who I’d ask for recommendation letters are professors who are currently in my department.

Just bite the bullet and ask them, risking them finding out that I’m considering leaving? If I don’t get another job, I’ll be forced to stay in the program, and that would be awkward. \n\nShould I revisit the idea of asking faculty who I worked with during my master’s for recommendations?

        "text": "I used chatgpt to help my quarterly report. It just came out a few days ago (this was mid december) and I thought it can help write my report describing what I have done in lab. I used it a bit too much, it was word for word for the first two sentences of the intro. Later on it started to just be my words, except I used it to help grammar check and add a few details. But overall my shit. \n\nRegardless I think it was stupid to use it, but I didn't realize or think about it at the time. When my PI found out I told her that it was a mistake and wouldn't do it again (which I obviously didn't). A month later, nothing big happened. I had minor mistakes like being late to a meeting due to a student asking a question in my office hours. Or when my professor asked me to draw the chemdraw pictures I traced them (which was only bad for the mechanism the rest would be identical if I did it myself). She insisted to come to her classes which I did, except for one because my TA position didn't allow it. Overall from the initial mistake I made basically 0.\n\nCome today, my PI tricks me by telling us we are having a meeting about our work (we planned this yesterday to have it today). I come to her office and my other colleague who was working with me was not there. She then basically says you are being kicked out. For what? For cutting corners. She basically insisted that I was cutting corners intentionally that my essay I wrote was intentionally made to deceive, (when it was made because I was stupid) that I have just been cutting corners constantly. And basically just lists what I say, and then goes back to what I was like last quarter. Stating I didn't show up to her 166 an undergrad class (which I didn't even know she wanted us to go to). \n\nThen just starts critiquing my character by stating I act like I am better then everyone, and I am  intentially spiking my products to get good results. Which one, I think I am a fucking idiot and I realize I am the stupidest one in the lab, and two thats a downright lie. Basically I act confident because I don't want to live with high amount of self doubt. Plus that's not really a good reason to kick me out. Basically it felt like my PI just disliked me, had one reason to grip onto and just end it. \n\nEven after working 50 hours a week making less than minimum wage, grading papers, doing classes, reading papers, researching, doing reaction, doing presentations, going to her classes, etc. And getting good results I was still cutting corners, simply because a mistake I acknowledged was bad all the way on December. I understand if that was the sole reason, that they dont want plagiarism but to be this angry simply because of one thing I apologized for and critiquing everything else was just unfair. \n\nI honestly liked the lab, I liked the research, I actually got something really interesting. But I guess it didn't matter I was cutting corners.",

This is unlike general writer's block/lack of motivation/procrastination that happens every so often with a boring paper because I've always been able to bounce back from those lags, especially with all-nighters or trips to libraries which I can't currently do. I'm looking for some creative solutions/advice. \n\nFor context, I'm currently 6 months into an 8-month full-time WFH internship program that is a requirement to complete my MA in public policy. Over the last month at work, 3 colleagues, and now also my manager, has left our team. We're only 2 people now on my project. The work isn't very hard, but I find myself barely able to muster up the energy to do the basic analytical tasks there, which is unusual for me. I don't really *feel* stressed at work, but my senior colleagues are, as they've even cried to me over the phone. I think I'm growing detached, with is less ideal because I don't want to crash and burn. I'm sure that the work stress is carrying over at the end of the day when I try to put in the time to work on my report, but I am not allowed to take time off as per internship rules and short-staff issues so there aren't much I can do about that. Also, I have no manager anymore for the next few weeks until someone new eventually shows up anyway. \n\nWhen work is over,  I feel too drained to work on my internship report (It's not a thesis) despite knowing I need to and it's the last assignment to do before it's all done. My first draft was supposed to be due in January but my supervisor is really understanding so she gave me an extension. Now we are approaching the second draft deadline by end of February when I still haven't finished the first. I feel bad. I try telling myself that 5k-ish words can be done in one night, or less, as I've done this many times before, but I'm still just facing some mental block that leads to many unproductive days and it's so frustrating. \n\nI tried picking up a crafty hobby to relax and feel some accomplishment with finished products there, which worked for a little while, but now I simply do not have the time to spend hours with crochet hooks. I need to get this done. I've tried using the Forest app and taking a break for 2 days and then coming back to it, or concentrating on getting it done over weekends, but none of these methods seem to be working. It's just 5k of a 12k paper. Only a lit review, an analysis, and a theoretical component. This sounds so ridiculous as I'm even typing it out, but I have never run into this problem before and I've fallen out of touch with the other students in my cohort (they won't respond to me reaching out).

I'm not sure what to do since there's no guarantee I'll get in  anywhere else. I'm thinking my options are:\n\n* Try to negotiate with her and explain the situation. \n* Contact some of the other universities I applied to saying I have a time-sensitive offer and would appreciate a status update. However, I'm afraid that committees will think I'm bluffing and pressuring them to decide on my application since they can't verify my story.\n\nI'm a bit panicked since I really want to know what the other schools have to say, but I don't want to lose my (potentially) only ticket to grad school. I'm also slightly alarmed since I'm not sure I really want to work with this PI if this is how they treat applicants knowing that schools are in the swing of releasing decisions.

        "text": "I am a 26 yo autistic man currently in his second semester of grad school, and I’m at my wits end. Not just with grad school, but with school period. \n\nBecause of my disability, it takes me more time and energy than my neurotypical peers to do the same amount of work. As a result, the idea of doing any kind of overwhelming task, including academic ones, causes anxiety that leads to procrastination. It kicks in almost instinctively whenever I read the prompt for an assignment. \n\nSo, in reaction, I shut down. I don’t do it. I laze around. I watch YouTube on my phone. That is until I can’t ignore it anymore because it’s due tomorrow/next week/a few weeks from now. I pull my hair out. Then I somehow eventually muster up the courage to finish whatever it is in 1-2 days. And yes, it really is 1-2 days. Often without sleep. \n\nThen once I’m done, and get the good grade or whatever, I deflate. I tell myself that to avoid the mental trauma of last semester I will make sure to be on top of things from day one. I look forward to that enthusiastically. Until I see my next assignment at start of the next semester, and then it all happens again.\n\nWith a few exceptions, this has been every academic semester since the spring of my sophomore year of high school, when I started taking AP classes. And while my academic skills have definitely gotten better over the years (the coursework for AP classes are super easy for me now, but they were soul crushingly hard for me then) I have never been able to break this vicious cycle. \n\nI barely survived high school in terms of stress and had one semester so bad that I crashed and burned and got two Cs in my AP classes. Having to deal with an unhappy mom didn’t help. \n\nOnce I got to my freshman year of undergrad, I had a semester so stressful I started going bald. And then every semester after that the ugly cycle repeated itself. Yet over the years burnout slowly set in.\n\n By the time I reach my upperclassman years, I was turning in assignments late, and by the end of my last semester, which was when COVID hit, it got to the point where I got an email from a professor saying that I was about to get a D and needed to improve my grade. Luckily, I was able to raise it to a B, but not without a last little dose of mental trauma. \n\nYet in undergrad, as hard as my homework was, especially writing essays, reading was the easy part. And the fact that I’m good writer didn’t hurt. So, even in my worst moments, I managed to pull though in the end, and I was always prepared for class at the most basic level. \n\nThat’s not the case anymore. Now in grad school, I can’t read everything from front to back like I used to, because it’s impossible. At first this was making me pull my hair out, as usual, but then I was given the usual advice: skim, pick and choose,take notes, etc. \n\nThe thing is, even though I don’t have to read everything, skimming, picking and choosing etc. is harder than reading front to back, and I have no fucking idea how to do it properly. Reading now takes just as much energy as essay writing, and I don’t know if I can handle them both. I feel like I am never done working, even if I skim and pick and choose, etc. like I’m supposed to, and that scares me shitless, because I feel I need to be done at some point in order to keep my sanity. \n\nI often feel like an embarrassing idiot in my classes, even compared to my classmates who also procrastinate and bitch and moan about how much work they have to do, like me. Yet somehow they manage to be competent, despite everything. \n\nI, meanwhile, am stuck in the same vicious cycle. Last semester, which was my first semester of grad school, I managed to get straight As, but not without a great cost. The cycle repeated itself yet again, and after everything I’ve been though, it got so mentally painful this time that I had a suicidal meltdown that escalated until I inflicted self-harm on myself for the first time in my life. \n\nThis was my second suicidal meltdown last year. The first one was triggered by all my undergrad friends moving away and my last attempt to get a full time job between undergrad and grad school falling through. Now I believe I just botched my first major assignment of the semester and am doomed to get a B in the class, if I’m lucky enough to break the cycle. \n\nNow, I know technically if I just *manage my time* breaking the cycle is possible, but if I so much as think about whatever assignment I have to do, before I can even blink I’ve already had a subconscious panic attack and I shut down. And so the cycle continues. \n\nAnd I’m so burnt out at this point after all these years that even when I know something is due soon, even if my brain gets nervous, my body’s fight or flight response will not activate because I just can’t handle it. Once you throw applying for internships and plain old adulting into the mix, then things start getting super ugly, super fast. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? If I keep going on like this then I don’t know if I can finish grad school without doing a number on my mental health. But as hard as I try to will myself to break this vicious cycle, I always end up coming back to it. \n\nAnd yes, I know everyone procrastinates sometimes, but I really don’t want to keep up the status quo in this case. But, I’m scared. Scared that I have to use just as much energy reading as I do when writing. Scared that I can’t rely on one, universal structure or strategy for my all my readings/assignments. Scared that no matter what I try to keep up with my work, I’ll still look like an idiot who doesn’t know what he’s doing or be brought to the brink of suicide or both. This alone is enough to make me shut down. \n\nOh, and on top of everything, most of my cohort has full-time job experience in my field, while I don’t because I was never able to get anything full-time between undergrad and grad school. So yeah, I feel they have professional experiences they can draw on that I just don’t, and I am insecure about that. \n\nI’m not sure I’m happy in my program, but I’ve already paid for it with a great scholarship. And I am happy in the city I moved to for my program. Even though it was an adjustment at first, I have gotten used to it and am just now starting to put down roots. \n\nI’ve been getting full-time job offers from an employer that I applied to a long time ago that has great benefits, but I can’t accept because it would involve leaving my current city. And even if I drop this program and start another one that I enjoy more later on in life, what if I still haven’t broken the cycle by then? Also, I don’t know if another program that I enjoy more could get me the full-time job I desperately need. \n\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do?",
