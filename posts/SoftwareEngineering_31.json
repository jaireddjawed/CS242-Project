What would you focus on if you were me? \n\nBootcamp taught RoR, React.js, SQL etc. \n\nThanks",

This would be for the position of a Computer Programmer/analyst. \n\nBesides the intro, my biggest question is if there are any video series that literally teach you full stack development? And I mean, from the start. I haven't began any classes, and although I'm not clueless as to how everything works, i might as well be. I'm 19, Have A LOT of free time on my hands, and for what it's worth, I enjoy Video's and Hands on work more than reading.\n\nThanks guys, i appreciate the expertise :)",

However, every day I feel less and less motivated, and I can feel myself getting depressed. The basics of programming are fine for me, I can fly through a simple application without a hitch. But now that I am taking more advanced courses I'm starting to struggle. I follow along just fine in class, everything makes sense to me, and I do well on the quizzes. But when I go to do the homework everything just escapes from my memory. It stops making sense, the things that I know seem foreign. I try to give it my all but I don't think it's enough. I fear failing my class. I've turned in unfinished and non-functional programs a couple of times because I just can't seem to get it. It's not that I don't try, I look at my work almost every day. Every time I think \"I got this\" I do it wrong and it doesn't work. This is making me feel that I won't be able to pass any job interviews, and if by some miracle I do I'll get fired for being incompetent. It scares the shit out of me. It's making me not want to go through with this. I don't even have my career yet and I feel like I'm the worst developer on the planet. I fear that I'm never gonna be successful.",

        "text": "A while back there was a highly upvoted post on reddit about Thorn, an organisation that takes on technology volunteers (and other volunteers) to help aid their work in combating trafficking. (https://www.wearethorn.org/)\n\nI signed up because I thought volunteering my skills as a software engineer could be fun, useful, and more effective than other forms of volunteer work (because I do this for a living).\n\nThey haven't got back to me yet, probably a combination of hitting reddit front page and getting a swarm of volunteers and the fact that i don't have many years experience as a software engineer (while I'm sure they're getting a lot of attention from experienced software engineers now).\n\nSo my question is this: How do I go about finding other, similar organisations, where I can volunteer to contribute tech skills - preferably with the best possible impact I can manage (helping stop / catch trafficking would have been amazing).\n\nAlso, before I get called stupid, I just wanted to point out that I'm aware of open source contributions, just looking for the best places to do it, and would prefer an actual voluntary role where I can work closely within a team.\n\nTLDR: what 'good causes' can I volunteer for using java back end and other technology skills, where I can really get involved with the team?",

        "text": "I'm a student for a couple more years, majoring in ECE and my plan is to be a software engineer, eventually working on back end or embedded projects. I've got a rough idea of what a software engineer does, since my wife is one. She's worked almost exclusively on front end and automated testing/QA and I think that's neat although I want to do something similar, but not the same. \n\nI am a nontraditional student, 35 years old with a family. I have tech experience, but no engineering specific experience. I've worked on sonar systems in the US Navy and on PVD, CVD, and electroplating metal deposition tools in the semiconductor industry, from maintenance to sensor trend analysis. I've also repaired and maintained forklifts, conveyors, and other warehouse equipment. I'm not sure if any of this experience directly applies to development cycle methodologies, since I know little about what actually goes on in a development life cycle, but I'm pretty sure things like project milestones and documentation of completed work translate over pretty well, with different systems or software being used to do it at most employers.\n\nWhat I'm asking is what do I really do to become a software engineer? My wife took the computer engineering route and specialized with her master's, while my advisors at school and the recruiters for universities (I'm finishing up at community college) say computer science is what I should be majoring in. I plan to follow her path, but is there a significant jump from computer engineering grad to software engineer? Is there a middle step somewhere in between?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi all. I'm considering transferring to software engineering at my university (Penn State Online). I've  already done 40 credits of my B.S. degree in Energy &amp; Sustainability policy and I've always considered it too easy. Problem is, only 9 of my credits could transfer over so it's a good few thousand dollars and almost a year of my life I'd be walking away from, not a simple matter. \nI am quite interested in computers and increasingly blockchain technology. I've learned a number of computer languages just in my free time and enjoy the problem solving and making beautiful things that are functional and had designed some somewhat simple apps for android that solved problems in my life. I think that software engineering will be a really solid degree both in gaining very functional skills and getting high earning power. My only question then is, how is the work itself on a day to day? \n\nI see a lot of people complaining on the r/engineering about having their spirit broken and just doing mundane shit every day. Is there a lot of that in software engineering also? I actually don't use a lot of money, I was on a fraction of a software engineers salary for the last few years and still saved the vast majority of my income and even bought a house. My point is I would be happy enough to take a lower salary to work on something awesome. By low salary in this case I think 60,000 would be low with two years experience. Am I being realistic that I could find interesting work at that price? ",
