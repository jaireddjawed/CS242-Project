Perhaps it has to do with the glorification of competition and survival of the fittest, and the idea that one's selfish self-interest can have a positive side effect on the group as a whole.\n\nBut how much of this is actually based in Darwin's ideas? And did early proponents actually use Darwin's ideas to argue for capitalism?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "This question was sparked by a popular post on TIL about functional illiteracy. People had trouble finding sample items from functional literacy tests online (they're all probably behind paywalls; that's how these things usually work). Can anyone who has worked in this field tell us a bit about what the test looks like? In particular, I'd like to get a sense of whether it tests grammar knowledge, comprehension of extended reading passages, or comprehension of basic phrases (e.g., would someone who is functionally illiterate have even a rough idea of what \"Help me!\" and \"Go away\" mean?). Also, I assume these tests are administered via interview rather than written tests (if they were administered via written tests, that seems like a confound). \n\nMy hunch is that when many people hear \"functionally illiterate,\" they imagine a person who is unable to comprehend a basic written word or phrase, but that this is not what functional literacy tests measure. I'm also interested in how this relates to the amount of text used online (on social media in particular) by people who are functionally illiterate. I'm guessing that there are many functionally illiterate people who read and write a lot on social media, but don't use proper grammar. \n\nAnd are there any studies that link functional illiteracy to negative outcomes while controlling for SES?",

I have been lurking for a long time, and it is time for me to reach out to the experts with some questions.\nI am a senior in high school at a boarding school with many international students. For a cultural activity that is happening in late February, I want to conduct a school-wide survey of the languages spoken at my school. I would like to gather data such as # of languages spoken, # of people that speak them, methods of acquisition, self-reported fluency (for this should I ask that they describe their fluency themselves, so as to not ask leading questions? or should I give them a framework so they can choose what fits their proficiency the most? I know that the phrasing is very important for this part), etc.\nBasically, I would like some advice from any of you that have ever done anything even remotely similar. For example, how do I deal with dialects vs. languages? I know some people might not consider their language a 'real' language due to political sensitivities, like a speaker of a Wu dialect might not. I would like the data to be as linguistically accurate (in the academic, scientific sense) as possible.\nFeel free to suggest questions that I can ask, ways in which I might organize the data, etc. I am open to any and all suggestions!\nMany thanks in advance to all of you. I hope I can educate my classmates a little bit on the topic we all love so much, and help dispel any badlingusitics ideas that might be floating around in my community.",

However, Pager's study is over a decade old and was in Milwaukee, a highly segregated area with a high incarceration rate. In addition, both studies focused on entry level jobs; the job market for low skill jobs is probably significant from that of higher paying ones.\n\n[This](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9938) paper seems to indicate that there is no casual correlation between having a black name and a lower socio-economic status, which suggests that in the inital stage of applying for a job, sending in a resume, having a black name should not put one at a greater disadvantage than having a criminal record. But, this study also is over a decade old, and as such, might not be entire accurate with regards to today.\n\nSo anyways, how true is the claim in the title?\n\nThanks.\n",

I can see why one could expect that the years and the kind of schooling you may have had could influence your tolerance of homosexuality for instance. But it is often operationalized in terms of \"participation in cultural activities\" or something alike. \nHow does being someone that goes to the opera once in a while make you likely to also be someone that is tolerant of homosexuality? And that is, with those two not being mere byproducts of the same other indicators of social standing, but the former actively explaining part of the latter?",

Because the general population has many different concerns, while the special interest only has a few, the special interest wins out.  People can only really vote based on a few different \"issues\" or \"concerns\", and the ones that they only \"kind of\" dislike get ignored.\n\nThis concept seems like it should have a name, but I'm not sure how to find it.

Group A is interested in X but Group B is vehemently opposed to X. The only problem is that for Group A to get X, they would have to give up or at least go through the risk of having to deal with changes to a bunch of other factors they are more interested in, so they might have to tolerate not pushing for X anymore, because other things are more important to them. Whereas Group B really doesn't want X and won't lose out for making sure X doesn't happen. As a result, Group A cannot get what it wants.",

Full disclosure - I don't think scientists should be prescriptive - even if it's for egalitarian goals. But that's besides the point. A lot of the research in our lab, and lots of social justice (and social psych generally) research has really small effect sizes. (Like smaller than what the \"small\" cutoff is usually set at for a given effect size test.) So, even though statistically significant, the effects, to me, seem entirely negligible - even if they *technically* provide empirical support for implicit racial bias or other \"immoral\" or otherwise \"bad\" phenomena (which I agree is a huge problem in this country). \n\nSo, now with some context, my question is - how do you justify extremely small effect sizes, even when your research pertains to extremely socially important (sometimes life and death) social justice related phenomena? The argument I hear from the grad students in my lab goes something like \"well we admit our effects are really small, but we are talking about racism and sexism, really important topics that effect tons of people negatively - so even small effects are meaningful and important.\" The logic holds, but I just feel like if the effects of the phenomena you are looking at are so small, then maybe if you really want to help the problem you should look at different interventions and phenomena/mechanisms. To me, they are just justifying their scientifically negligible (in the sense that their manipulations make little to no difference on behavior) research interests/projects by appealing to emotions and egalitarian values. Although not intentional, it almost makes me feel angry like they are using racism or sexism to justify their own research interests and careers. It also just seems, ironically, immoral to me for scientists to be so blatantly prescriptive and, at times, down right condescending to anyone with a hint of conservative ideology. (I'm a liberal) ",

        "text": "Hello Redditors,\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's the first time I post on Reddit, so if the post doesn't fit in the subreddit, remove it please.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am currentlty in Master 2 of Sociology in France, and doing an Erasmus in Germany.\n\nI apologize in advance for the many mistakes I will do in english, but I hope you’ll understand what I mean !\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have to write for may a 100-pages master thesis, and I chose for object cemeteries in Germany.\n\nMore precisely, I would like to study the different usages made of cemeteries nowadays by people, the spaces created by peoples’ usages in cemeteries, and how theses spaces and activities like jogging, taking photos, remembering adapts one to each other in a considered « sacred » place and place of common/group and individual memories.\n\nIn the continuity of the idea of cemeteries as memory places/places where you can remember, I make the hypothesis that many factors like the appearance or the place of the grave in the cemetery are ways to distinguish themselves socially, and that this social distinction is a process to distinguish and maintain the individual memony of dead people and families.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo basically, I have two main reasearch questions : 1. What are the social usages of cemeteries nowadays and how are they organized together (concurrence, cooperation?) ? 2. How is the individual memory created and maintained in cemeteries through social distinction ?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI face many problems wich are :\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLiterature :\n\n1\\. The few literature in sociology about cemeteries (I read in french, english and german). I found some articles in history about cemeteries, only 10 approximately, french english and german together. \n\n**Do you know articles, books or authors dealing with cemeteries or a similar subject ? Or that could help me ?**\n\n2\\. I am wondering if it is pertinent to make a state of the art about french cemeteries when the cemeteries I will study are in Germany. I find a bit more articles about the evolution of cemeteries in french and I can read it faster and understand it easier than in german, but german cemeteries are pretty different from french ones especially because of the different evolution of the relationship between the state and the church. **What would you advise ?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMethodology :\n\nConcerning the methodology, I would like to work with :\n\n* observations of habits and behaviours in the cemetery\n\n* mapping : they would show the areas produced by the usages and/or those already existing, and others which would recense different kind of graves (children, incinerated…) and features like the decorations.\n\n* I think interviews could be a great way to have informations about the cemetery, its history maybe, the people using it and the usages, depending who I would ask (the cemetery management, the users of the cemetery…). My problem now is that **I am not sure what informations I can ask the different actors.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAuthors :\n\nAbout the authors I will refer to Bourdieu for the social distinction, to the Chicago’s School for the mapping and the interactions/organization between individuums and the place, and Lefebvre for his rythmanalysis which can be really helpful to hilight the different spaces created by the usages and the architecture/organization of the place, and the different rythms of this place, how they coordinate with each other.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am not making a comparison between two cemeteries, which would be very interesting but too much work for a master 2 within a few months. I just want to study one small cemetery within Berlin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you have any other advice or remark concerning the research, the master work, etc., they are welcome too !\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading !\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**tl;dr :** 1\\. looking for authors, articles about history or sociology of german cemeteries\n\n2\\. research made in Germany, but difficulties for the state of the art which can more easily be made in french but really pertinent, though. What is your advice ?\n\n3\\. Would like to make interviews but I don’t know what to ask the actors I could contact.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit : formatting",

But with a bachelor in Psychology I can't shy away to do it the quantitative way (even-though my faculty is practically in love with qualitative research). I have designed a short experiment, which I need to test in 4 different groups (between subject design). For this I need an equal distribution of participants for the groups (demographics like age I'll leave to chance).\n\nMy question for this: Is there a way for me to 'upload' 4 different surveys into 'one' and that whenever you use the link it switches between those 4 to make sure the N stays about the same for each? For example if I would open the survey in 4 different tabs I would have 4 different surveys open (they are all about the same but some questions are about a negative attitude instead of positive).\n\nI have worked with Qualtrics before during my bachelors, but I can't remember having an option like that. Unfortunately my student account there was bound to my faculty back then, so I'll have to check with my current faculty whether I can get a new student license.\n\nAny help would be really appreciated!
