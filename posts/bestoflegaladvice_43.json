They will be hosting an AMA on Wednesday 5/2, with questions opening at 11 AM EDT (8 AM PDT), and answers starting around 2-3 PM EDT (11 AM - noon PDT).\n \nThe A2J Lab’s vision statement:\n“By providing decision-makers with credible evidence about what works in access to justice, we can make the system work better for individuals and families who are unable to afford lawyers. This kind of information—the kind that comes from randomized control trials and rigorous qualitative evidence—will allow people with the power to make change to implement solutions that really make a difference.”",

So everybody, regardless of political affiliation, can now play the next round in the Trump game of musical chairs!\n\nPick [one senior figure](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXK5cVlW0AAOaxD.jpg) and the date they leave, and the first person whose pick loses their job or quits wins! Winner gets a no-expenses paid trip to Ken Ham's [Ark Encounter \"theme park\"](https://arkencounter.com/) in beautiful Williamstown, KY, courtesy of our prior winner /u/tanjasimone. In addition the winner will get other fabulous prizes and flair of their choice.* \n\n**Major RULE: Only put a name as a top level post if you're the first person to suggest them.** Otherwise reply to that post with other dates. This will make it easier to see who has been picked and when. If you start a new top level post on someone who already has been picked then your pick doesn't count. Try for a week's separation between picks of the same person. \n\nThis is not the place to brigade or attack the President or defend him, merely to guess who will be the next to depart to \"spend more time with their family/join an ashram.\"\n\nPrior Winners: \n\nDeath Pool III: /u/tanjasimone with Ronny Jackson\n\nDeath Pool II: /u/available_username2 with David Shulkin (TO THE DAY!)\n\nDeath Pool I: /u/greyscales with Joseph diGenova\n\n^*Prizes ^do ^not ^exist ^and ^would ^not ^be ^fabulous ^if ^they ^did, ^flair ^will ^probably ^be ^by ^mod ^choice, ^void ^where ^prohibited.",
