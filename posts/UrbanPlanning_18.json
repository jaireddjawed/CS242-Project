        "text": "Hello, I would like to ask the following question.\nIn the 4th year of my Bachelor of Regional and Town Planning, I have the option of skipping the 4th year and completing one year of an honours degree, bumping it up to a Bachelor of Regional and Town Planning (Honours). \n\nI would like to ask if this is important within the town planning industry. I'm currently in my first semester (mid year 2018 entry) but this looks like I need to plan ahead or at least start thinking about it. The degree comes at no extra cost (8,300 per semester, for 2 semester either way). It wouldn't impact when I graduate (unless I fail) and it won't impact many other things either, only my 4th year course content and title. That's all if I get in as well, I need a 5.5/7 GPA which doesn't look TOO hard to get but may be a bit on the challenging side. \n\nThe only difference is instead of getting to do 5 electives (out of a choice of ~50), I do a honours thesis (presumably on transport planning, as that is the area I would love to work in). So I am wondering:\n\nIs an Honours degree worth it? And would it be recognised in any capacity? Does it make any difference?\n\nI mean, a thesis sounds like quite a lot of work, and while 4th year subjects wont be easy either, my subject has no elective courses, so doing 5 seem like fun (Especially with titles such as \"Global Population Issues\" and \"Professional Planning Practicum\". But on the other hand, an honours degree sounds better and I'd get to focus on transport planning (which there is basically no electives for), and I should be thinking of my future, not my right now?\n\nAlso, sorry if this is the wrong place to post, it doesn't look like its against the rules but I've been wrong before?",

Up until the mid 20th century, [flophouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flophouse) served an important place in society. They served the low and no income demographic, giving them a place to get off the street and a safe place to sleep. \n\nNow we live in a time where this demographic has been regulated to the fringes. While researching flophouses I discovered two articles advocating to bring them back. \n\nThis [one from Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/07/sros_flophouses_microapartments_smart_cities_are_finally_allowing_the_right.html) and [this one from Reason](https://reason.com/archives/2012/10/28/bring-back-the-flophouse).\n\nWhat struck me as extremely interesting is the sources of two almost identical articles. These two sources could not be at more opposite ends of the political spectrum. Slate is very liberal and Reason is very conservative. The fact that we have the exact same argument from two such dynamically opposed viewpoints, makes me wonder, why is this not happening?  What do you think? Is it time to bring back the flophouse? What are the pros and cons of flophouses?  Can we bring wider exposure to a need that is not being filled because cities have regulated them out of existence?\n",

        "text": "Hi planners,\n\nI am a first year planning student in Cleveland. I currently work at an architecture &amp; planning firm in my city of residence (a 50 minute commute from my school). My job is definitely 95% architecture, 5% planning, but I've always been okay with it because I got my undergrad in architecture, it pays decently, and it's very close to my home. \n\nHowever lately, I have been going absolutely INSANE with having to bear the extreme differences I have politically and ideologically with everyone around me. \n\nWe are a small office, and therefore we don't have any rules in place about leaving political debate outside. Everyone is very much in love with Trump, capitalism, the elite, and they worship the feet of our clients (strip retail developers). Obviously I understand the last point since we have to make a living, but I just feel my sanity degrading more and more and more. At this office, they love sprawl, because it means more shopping plaza. They also hate anything that has to do with the environmental sustainability because it's a headache for them, so of course they're always saying the global warming isn't real, and that no one would mind a world without the color green, etc, etc, etc.\n\nAt first it was fun, because we'd have little discourses &amp; I was viewed as the spunky liberal, but now it's just exhausting and disheartening. I feel like I'd be much happier to have a real planning gig where people understand what I'm learning. \n\nI feel like if I stay here, I'm part of a lot of the problems that planners face, in terms of greedy developers &amp; an ignorant populace. \n\nI hope this post doesn't cause political debate --- the point of the post is just to talk about whether or not it's worth it to find a job setting that you feel more ideologically and politically aligned with.\n\n\"Why haven't you quit already?\"  \nThe biggest reason is that here I at least get paid! It appears the majority of planning internships don't pay, or at least pay more than minimum wage, &amp; with an hour commute to classes three times a week, I can't afford to have an unpaid internship.  \nI also don't think I can find a new architectural job- because I would want to be honest with them and tell them, \"Yes I will work hard for you, but just as an FYI: I am going to become a planner in a few years and will leave you in the dust.\"\n\nAnyway, lots of personal information in this post. I kind of fear the responses, but I want to know what you all think, since you are in the same profession &amp; most likely have the same passion for what you believe in. Whatever that may be.\n\nSo, as a TLDR:\n\nHow important is working within a setting that has a similar mindset &amp; cares about the same things that you care about?",

I'm not saying that they aren't interesting, as there are some very interesting concepts that can perfectly be carried over to Europe, but I'd like to ask you if you know of any good Europe-centered resources for small towns (as opposed to bigger towns, who have their own, different set of problems).\n\nI'd be happy to give you all kinds of extra details if you need them :)\n\n---\n\nI'd also like to ask you for another favour. \n\nIn one of the population centers of the town, we have [this empty plot of land](https://i.imgur.com/RKAIr3t.jpg) (ignore the circus). Other than the structure at the top, which can't be removed, the rest of the plot of land (that isn't already built) is an empty slate.\n\nThis population center has a pretty bad parking problem, solved, as you can see, by cars just randomly parking in the undeveloped land. _Our plan_ is building a 2-story parking, with the bottom floor in a semi-underground, and the other on top of it, with some embellishment (green stuff) over it spaced around. We don't want to make a parking through the entire green area, so like 75% of it would be up for grabs. The parking will be almost free for residents of the town, and with normal costs for outsiders.\n\nThe favour I wanted to ask you was: Is this a good plan? Which would be your ideas to develop this land, assuming that from the city council we have complete control over what to do on it? Since nothing exists in a vacuum, [this is the \"parking\"](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/39.49992/2.75911), and [this is the satellite view](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.499589,2.7587626,417m/data=!3m1!1e3) of the area. We only have to worry with the area to the south of the purple line, to the north is actually from the other town.\n\n",

And I currently listen to podcasts on subjects I think are far more esoteric (like foreign policy) or are have far smaller bases to pull from (clean energy) - both with significantly more offerings than housing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do find planning podcasts, but I either can't stand them (Invisible City) or they tend to be about other topics (Overhead Wire and transportation). Can anyone point me to housing podcasts they'd recommend or at least more urban planning/community development podcasts? ",

It sits on ~140 acres of former brownfield, and a handful of industrial buildings. Another is The Yards in Washington DC, which is ~42 acres.\n\nThe Riverbend Golf Course in Kent, WA was sold off for redevelopment. However the scale of development on the Kent site isn't appropriate for this transit rich site, so I'm unsure of whether I'll use it as an example.\n\nI also know of a few large projects in and around Vancouver BC, however they are still in the planning stages. Specifically the Oakridge Centre, and the Southgate redevelopment, as well as a few others.\n\nAny examples ya'll know of?",

There is a lot of sprawl, downtown in very small. The town has had most of it's growth in the past 30 years so it's very automobile oriented.  \n\nAs much as I'd love my city to be walkable, all I can think about is how that would work. Summers are constantly in the 90s and can get in the 100s with terrible humidity. Winters get freezing cold. Lots of large hills that would make biking hell.  This makes the car seem very appealing to people when you can get from your home garage to your work's parking lot and avoid the weather. \n\nSo what are some options? Obviously mixed use areas would make commutes shorter, and trees can provide shade but shade only does so much.",

The intention of my company is offer the student placement at our company while they complete their studies if they are the right fit culturally. Our company is not just supporting the scholarship to develop talent. They do really wish to support local students. The talent is just a perk. \n\nI have interviewed plenty of planners and designers over the years but I feel I should be taking a different approach when it comes to someone entering uni as it’s been over a decade since I was in academia. I also want to support someone who will be a good student and make a difference to the planning world. My experience is that these people tend to not make the best employees so I wish to make that distinction. \n\nWhat questions would you ask someone looking to start a degree in planning? Keeping in mind they will have no planning experience. \n\nMy suggestions;\n\n* As a planner what is your favourite city in the world, if you don’t have a favourite city what is your favourite local suburb and why?\n\n* What are your thoughts on (local controversial planning development)?\n\n* What does your perfect street look like? \n\n* Town planners are often the most disliked person in the room of any meeting and you will learn to never tell a taxi driver or anyone but close friends your industry of employment. Why do you want to get into planning?\n\n* What do you do for fun, how do you spend you’re downtime. \n\nThanks and let me know your thoughts. ",

I'm trying to work out how to describe and quantify an \"inclusive\" downtown and one metric I am trying to use is \"% of residents in poverty.\" I'm not sure what the ideal results are to demonstrate that a downtown is inclusive.\n\nBreakdown of my conundrum:\n\nLow % of downtown residents in poverty is more likely to be an indication that downtown is unaffordable and therefore not inclusive than it is an indicator that there is an absence of poverty.\n\nHigh % of downtown residents in poverty would indicate a lack of economic opportunity or that living downtown is undesirable more than inclusive.\n\nThe best answer I've come up with so far is that the % of people in poverty downtown should probably be close to what is seen in the city/region at large, maybe slightly higher? This would indicate downtown is not pushing people out, is more welcoming to lower income residents than the city, yet is not avoided by people with the means to live elsewhere.\n\nFrom the data I've collected so far, breakdowns go as follows:\n\nThe final method would suggest:\n\nDT 1 is bordering on unaffordable for those in poverty? 6% and 3% below in a city/region with low poverty seems like a tough call.\n\nDT 7 is undesirable to middle class and affluent residents or has limited economic opportunity\n\nDT 2-6 are \"inclusive\" or close to it\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/p3etu2eck2j11.png\n\nMaybe I'm on the wrong track altogether and this isn't a metric I should be using.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

Imagine all the nature and mountain valleys that would be preserved and off-limits to sprawl that would make for an amazing nature day trip so close and easily accessible from the big city. Imagine how the character of the ethnic neighborhoods would be different with a density like NYC.\n\nIn this alternate universe, Los Angeles would hands down be the best city in the world IMO.
