My research interests are in high energy astrophysics and massive stars, specifically on core collapse supernovae and LBVs (I'm fortunate that at my current school we have a professor also interested in both; I'm planning on asking him where his collaborators work for possible schools next time I see him).",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I'm going into my sophomore year of high school and recently started to explore career options. I've found myself interested in physics-based fields and I can hold my own in math. Last year I took honors physics, this coming year I will be taking AP physics and honors chemistry in addition to calculus. So far I've looked into careers in statistics, engineering, and, most recently, physics. I realize the notion of gathering career inspiration from a television show may come off as laughable, but please hear me out. \n\nThose of you who have seen the show will recall Amanda Tapping's character, Samantha Carter, who is a theoretical astrophysicist that serves in the air force and is \"the foremost expert on wormhole travel.\" Carter's scientific ramblings often baffle other characters, but I am continually enraptured and intrigued with what I can understand. \n\nDo astrophysicists actually study such areas as the possibilities of wormholes, the nature of black holes, and the mysteries of time? These sort of topics interest me to no end. Obviously, working for a military-operated, top secret organization that deals with travel through space and time isn't the end goal here. But I like to think that being paid to discover details in topics at least covered in Stargate would be a phenomenal occupation.\n\nI realize that the field typically requires a Phd to delve into the truly fascinating opportunities (meaning multiple years of school), but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. For now, I'd greatly appreciate the chance to learn from all of you about what astrophysics truly entails, the paths you can traverse with an astrophysical background, and how satisfying astrophysics is (for those of you who are in the field or have been in the past). \n\nThanks, and feel free to ask for more information about me if necessary!",

Why is it necessary to hide UFOs, why disinformation, why putting all this under the carpet? It's a question of economics. All currencies on Earth are based on the value of gold. Not many citizens know that but gold is an extraterrestrial metal coming from the death of a star. When a star is dying, its mass is growing, atoms are compressed and when the star explodes, it spreads large amounts of gold in young solar systems. That's why gold is not a mineral to treat but a perfect, carbon free metal. This means that it is the most common substance in the universe, no more value than a piece of plastic.\"\n\nWhile staying on the topic of physics, is there validity to this claim?",

Most likely, when I factor in the growing gravitation of the stars I would have heaps of binary+ systems.\n\nBut what about the planets. I read that they are most likely formed from hheavier material ejected from the star. But when does this ejection take place. And whatabout gas giants? Are they simply stars that didnt achieve enough mass to ignite? If so, how did they form without becoming a part of the host star?",

From the top down it would look like the fluid flows flows from left to right with a drain which is the gravitational field of the black hole. \n\nI know the mechanics of flow work a bit differently than gravitational fields, but for me the visualization of a familiar science I can interact with helps.",

Slightly after the big bang, elementary particles started to form. As I understand it, you can't have two particles of the same state at the same position and time. That would mean the universe would get into an illegal state. A solution to this would be to distribute the particles over a bigger volume. Such an expansion could not be limited by speed of light if overlaps shall be avoided at all time.\n\nThis would still lead to a situation with the speed of light being exceeded. But whenever there is a contradiction between the theories of relativity and quantum physics, the latter always seem to win.\n\nMaybe I have seriously misunderstood something, or maybe this is all old ideas.",

If anyone has any advice for me I would really love to hear it.\n\n...\n\nHey Mr Gross,\n\nI'm sending you this message because I'm a little stuck in terms of deciding on a degree/career path and was hoping that you could give me some insight. Basically, I have an interest in physics/astronomy and had originally planned to get a degree in that field, go into a post-grad program and go into research of some kind. After completing some of the first year courses for that degree as well as a few other potential majors (I've done about three years of jumping back and fourth between arts and science at this point), I realized that while I am very interested in the field I would rather not be in school and living at home until I'm 30. That being said, I've started to look into career options for someone with a physics BSc, so that I could get out into the working world and then go back to school some years down the road when I'm older to potentially get a Masters and/or PhD. It seems as if there's not a ton of jobs specifically for physics majors with only a bachelors degree, but I was considering potentially looking into teaching high school physics/math for a bit. More than anything I was just hoping you could give me some insight as far as what the job market is like for these positions, or some other potential careers that would be relevant to that degree since you've probably been in a similar position to the one I'm in now. I'm also not 100% clear on what other schooling I would need besides my bachelors degree if I were to teach at a high school. Any advice you could give me would be much appreciated as I'm feeling a little lost at the moment. I'm not sure if I'm seeking this degree for the wrong reasons since I would be pursuing it more out of interest than the job opportunities it provides.\n\nThanks,\nMG",

        "text": "Hello, /r/astrophysics! \n\nI am currently in the process of developing the groundwork for a science-fiction novel.  The novel is going to be set in a fictional solar system, but I want to stay true to astrophysics.  I'm trying to stay closer to the hard end of the scifi scale: no FTL travel, teleportation, or anything like that.  If the novel ever gets off the ground and people read it, I want them to be impressed by how much effort and work went into modelling the world of the novel.  \n\nI would really like to create a thorough model of the fictional system.  I hope to have something like 15-20 planets in the system (is this even possible?).  I want to have their masses and sizes known, along with the mass, size, and type of star at the center.  Using these facts, I could calculate the orbital properties of the bodies, including the lengths of a day and a year for each planet.\n\nMy ultimate goal would be to develop a diurnal and annual clock for each planet which would allow me to track the location of each planet right from the start of the novel's events.  This way I would always know exactly where each planet was at any point along the novel's timeline, as well as what time of day it was and what time of the year it was on each planet.\n\nSo, my basic questions are: are there any easily obtained simulators that would allow me to go about this in this much detail? Would I mostly have to work it all out by myself? How would I even start with that? What are the sorts of things that astrophysicists or astronomers would look for to determine whether the fictional system is realistic or not?\n\nAny help in answering any of these questions would be very appreciated.  Thank you!\n\nEdited for syntax",

I am trying to calculate the Roche limits (both fluid and rigid) for a black hole, and the problem that I am having is that the formula calls for density, which for a black hole is functionally infinite (as we understand it currently) I've seen mass substituted, but before I do this, I want to be sure that it's kosher, because that seems... wonky.

I basically want to look at select wavelength regions of the BCS/HXT spectra during prominent Solar flare events.  My goal is to produce spectra with which to compare synthetic spectra of resonance and He-like dielectronic satellite lines with for a few different ions.\n\nNow comes the problem, I have very little clue what I am doing.  I have only really used python in the past, and I am struggling to find resources to provide help with achieving what I wish to.  In particular using the solarsoft package is proving quite confusing.  I am no where near a programming pro so any help any one of you could provide would be much appreciated.  If one of you has experience with the solarsoft package I would be very grateful of your help.\n\nI'm posting this to a couple of places, just for the purpose of hoping I reach the right audience.\n\nAnymore info required? please just ask!\n\nThank you!",

I want to be a real scientist. I want proper credentials. I want to be part of team that is contributing to the scientific community and trying to discover or learn something new. \n\nI've looked at a few ways of going back to school. But for the most part, it looks like I'd have to start undergrad all over again, since I don't have the right science credits to pick up with an MA. At 30, with a family to support, the idea of starting all over again, and spending 8 years or more before getting a PhD is depressing. \n\nI've looked at Swinburn University. I can get in their Astronomy online MA program. However, it's course work and not research. I don't know if any reputable PhD program back here in the States would take me on. And I don't know how an Astronomy MA would affect any research jobs down the road. \n\nI'm at a real loss here. I don't know what to do. Some people find what they love early in life. Some people, that love changes over time. Why I came to this so late, I don't know. But I want to make up for lost time the fastest way possible. \n\nAny help?",

Matter orbiting star begins to condense, form planets and larger objects.\n\n4. Objects eventually become planets, tadaa, you have a planetary system.\n\nSo my question is regarding the step 2.  Why does matter orbit the star in a flat disc?  Why can't matter orbit the star from a multitude of directions?  Is it simply that over time, the matter collides and knocks out or swallows up matter that it happens to collide with, eventually leaving no objects in stray orbits?  If special relativity states that gravity causes a bend in the fabric of spacetime, why doesn't all matter appear on a single plane, just as the planets orbiting star seem to do?  For matter to exist as it does, spacetime would have to exist in a 3 dimensional plane, which I can't easily visualize.\n\nEdit: I can't figure out how to word this correctly, but just know that I'm not saying exactly what I intend to when I talk about spacetime existing in a 3 dimensional plane.",

Hawking is included in this book in more detail than in the first for a possible solution of the God. He describes the supersymmetry and p-brane theory very plausible. I found especially interesting was the explanation of the extra dimensions that we can finally introduce in about themselves, as well as the associated solution approach to the explanation of dark matter! Stephen Hawking weighs the probability of time travel in an interesting way and gives an outlook on the society of the future. But this is perfectly acceptable, because it is a popular book and not everything can be described in simple words. Finally, it should be exciting! The images are very helpful in most cases and Hawkings described much humor actually leaves nothing to be desired!",
