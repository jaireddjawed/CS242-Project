        "text": "I got over it by now, but I was rereading this part of One Piece and came across this. Very simply, this is one of the reasons I didn’t like the change of the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Even though Luffy had to be creative to find ways to use his fruit offensively, and I can’t take credit away from him for that, before the change to the Nika fruit, scenes like this were much cooler. \n\nBefore it was about Luffy’s will to keep fighting no matter how hurt he was. What makes him stand up is himself as a person. I believe in that way it connects much more to each one of the readers and works as a motivation that if we all work hard enough, we will win (idk kinda corny but we are talking about a comic book at the end of the day). \n\nWith Luffy’s fruit being a Zoan type, I think it diminishes these parts of the story. Now we know he had more endurance because his fruit gives him that. Kinda wack imo, changes a whole mentality that the series had for 20 years. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0y6jwrljlla1.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d2e5b9676af1eed8e5a43fc9ecdcfa877cce2eb8",

        "text": "We know that one's Haki is more powerful if their will is strong and that they can train their will so that they can apply it to their limbs and/or weapons (Armament Haki), or that they can sense the will of someone about to hit them (Observation Haki). But this is where Conqueror's Haki comes in and confuses me because I don't know if it's a different type of Haki or just that people that don't back down from a fight just have a stronger Haki in general and they can just let their Haki go out their body and knock out people. I personally like the former one more and by a different type of Haki I mean like a different power other than the regular type everyone possess (just think about it like chakra from Naruto where basic Haki = normal chakra and  Conqueror's Haki = Kurama's chakra). So, this is where things get complicated because advanced modes of every form exist:\n\n\\-- Observation Haki - is the easiest one to explain because you can see into the future, that's all.\n\n\\-- Armament Haki - I think the base form is invisible but if you use stronger Haki your arm will blacken (it's just a theory we don't know if Rayleigh's arm wasn't black just because Haki wasn't a thing back then). Advance Armament is when you let your Haki flow outside your body to either push back the target (emission) or destroy it from the inside (internal destruction).\n\n\\-- Conqueror's Haki - I believe the advanced form is basically Advance Armament but you use the stronger version instead of the basic one and it makes your body almost invincible and you don't even need to touch your target to hit them really hard, basically emission and internal destruction combined.\n\nI think that's all and if you're wandering why I didn't mention Ryou is because in Wano Haki = Ryou. I didn't mention \"The voice of all things\" because I don't really know where to place it, I think it's an advanced mode of Observation but it isn't explained in the series that much so Idk. If I made any mistakes please correct me.",

Shanks is one of the Four Emperors and a former member of Gol D. Roger's crew, known for his exceptional swordsmanship and Haki abilities. Eustass Kid, on the other hand, is one of the Worst Generation and possesses a powerful Devil Fruit ability that allows him to manipulate metal.*\n\n*In terms of raw power, Eustass Kid's Devil Fruit ability may give him an advantage over Shanks, as it allows him to control and manipulate metal with incredible strength. However, Shanks' mastery of Haki and swordsmanship skills could also pose a significant threat to Eustass Kid.*\n\n*Ultimately, the outcome of a fight between Shanks and Eustass Kid would likely depend on a variety of factors, including the environment, the specific circumstances of the battle, and the combatants' strategies and tactics.*",

        "text": "As many of you know, Gold Roger's bounty was revealed in Chapter 957 to be a whopping 5,564,800,000, which is the largest bounty for a pirate ever issued.\n\nFor the majority of us who speak English, we're no strangers to jokes being lost in translation. But this one caught my attention, because why such a specific number? Which Marine was it that said \"Yes, this amount specifically. No we're not rounding up, it must be this amount exactly.\"\n\nThe answer is because Oda is a comedian and Japanese has many different ways of reading numbers.\n\nFor instance, the 6-4-8 at the end can also be read as Ro-Shi-Ya, a play on his name Roger.\n\nBut that begs the question - Why the 55 at the beginning? Why not just have it be 5,648,000,000 or 6,480,000,000? \n\nThe answer is foreshadowing. That 55 is important. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause 5-6 can be read \"Go-Mu\"\n\nI suspect Luffy's end of series bounty is going to be 5,600,000,000, which will finally surpass Roger's longstanding record as he becomes more of a threat to the World Government.",

Sushi puns, obviously, but caught my interest was his explanation of Zoro's \"x-pound phoenix\" attacks. Cannonballs are classified by weight, so a 16-pound canon would shoot 16-pound cannonballs.\n\nThinking back to Zoro's fight with Mihawk, I always loved the way he taunted and tested Zoro by brandishing a small knife instead of his black blade. I'll never forget his line: \"One does not bring a Canon to hunt rabbits\". Badass, right?\n\nI like to think this line stuck with Zoro, and he based some of his attack names with the idea that his swords are like canons, signifying his growth since he faced Mihawk.\n\nI dunno, thought it was a neat observation!",

We dont know much about Sora, but hence they were the Warrior of the sea and a hero to the World goverment. They seem to be important. Perhaps even indicating being an ancient weapon?

Zoro went from no conq to advn conq in 20 chapters. Luffy went from no conq to mastering it and losing to the same guy THREE times and still winning? Also it’s not foreshadowing to take a silhouette from a chapter 900 chapters ago and make a character do the same silhouette. That’s lazy writing. You know damn well Nika wasn’t planned from the start. And with egghead, it’s turning into another filler chapter section where some games of thrones ending information is thrown in and then chapters of nothing? Where is the consistency? I know people won’t like this but remove the rose tinted goggles and look at what ur being dealt..",

        "text": "Hello everyone i've made this theory on September 2022. Seeing how the manga is going atm I thought about sharing this. First time Posting on reddit so I hope Ive posted it correctly if not please do inform me. \n\nElbaf Theory :\n\nI think we all had this moment where we thought about old enemies of the straw hats returning back to the story at some point. Just like sir crocodile came back to the story.\nOne person that is always mentioned in those conversations is eneru. We know little about his back story but he surely left good impression and alot of questions in some of the readers/viewers minds.\n\nEneru came originally from birka, another island in the sky just like skypiea. He destroyed birka and took some fighters with him to take over skypiea.\n\nThe important information is that there are different sky islands. While the strawhats used the upstream to get to skypiea it was stated that there is a natural way to get to the sky Islands which pirates normally use. This entry is supposed to be in the new world. Keep that information in mind. \n\nNow I want to talk about the New World, specifically elbaf for a second. We know that the giants that live on elbaf are themed after the vikings and the north mythology. Eneru using attacks like El Thor may suggest that he's also themed after the north mythology. Also his home land birka used to exist in real life. Birka was a place in Sweden, where a old viking weapon was found. This weapon was a Hammer. But let's come back to elbaf.\nAs most of you already know elbaf spelled backwards means fable. When I first thought about skypiea and the connection to elbaf I thought of a story I used to hear alot when I was a child. Jack and the beanstalk. The story is about Jack, a poor country boy, that trades the family cow for a handful of magic beans, which grow into a massive, towering beanstalk reaching up into the clouds. Jack climbs the beanstalk and finds himself in the castle of an unfriendly giant.  You may already know what I'm trying to refer to.\nThe giant jack we saw on skypiea. Oda already used the giant jack as reference to reaching higher points and instead of an unfriendly giant we got eneru who was waiting at the top. Going back to the natural way of reaching skypiea in the new world I think elbaf will be most likely the place where this would be. We already saw a giant tree on the island which is most likely Yggdrasill, the world tree, a giant ash supporting the universe. One of its roots extended into Niflheim, the underworld; another into Jötunheim, land of the giants; and the third into Asgard, home of the gods. \n\nNow why would eneru be interested in coming back to earth when he's on the moon.\n\nLet me give you some information on Norse mythology.\nOdin the all father, Thor the God of thunder and law and order and Loki the trickster God live in asgard. Asgard is also called the kingdom of God's and is located right above Midgard \"the human world\".\n\nOfcourse one piece has its own story with unique characters and personalities. So oda might have a little twist in the story and a different outcome. My theory is that the kingdom of the gods is a place that eneru might find worthy to become his new home once he gets bored of staying on the moon. He has a strong God complex. And he can not be a God if Noone warships him.\n\nNow that we talked about eneru his connections to elbaf the Norse mythology and the giants I want to talk about other people that have similar connections. \n\nAnd these people are non other than blackbeard and shanks. \nYou may ask how are these two connected to anything mentioned previously. \n\nLet me give you some more information about the Norse mythology. \n\nLoki had a child named fenrir who is a wolf. \n\nFenrir, also called Fenrisúlfr, monstrous wolf of Norse mythology. He was the son of the demoniac god Loki and a giantess, Angerboda. Fearing Fenrir’s strength and knowing that only evil could be expected of him, the gods bound him with a magical chain made of the sound of a cat’s footsteps, the beard of a woman, the breath of fish, and other occult elements. When the chain was placed upon him, Fenrir bit off the hand of the god Tyr. He was gagged with a sword and was destined to lie bound to a rock until the Ragnarök (Doomsday), when he will break his bonds and fall upon the gods. According to one version of the myth, Fenrir will devour the sun, and in the Ragnarök he will fight against the chief god Odin and swallow him. Odin’s son Vidar will avenge his father, stabbing the wolf to the heart according to one account and tearing his jaws asunder according to another.\n\nThe reason why fenrir is mentioned as a villain in the norse mythology is because he killed Odin the all father. He also bit of the arm of Tyr who wielded his sword with just one arm since. \n\nWhitebeard who was the father to all of his crew members was killed by blackbeard. \n\nAnd shanks one who lost his arm and wields his sword with one arm. also he sails on a ship which is based on old viking ships. Even tho he did not Lose his arm because of blackbeard he still was the one to warn everyone about blackbeard. Further information we have about Tyr and loki is that loki once told Tyr that he is not able to solve conflicts he only creates them. Shanks who tried to warn whitebeard about blackbeard, who tried to stop kaido from attending at Ace execution, the same person who stopped the war at marineford and stopped green bull on wano kuni. He's known in the one piece World to atleast attempt to solve conflicts and confrontations before they happen. \n\nHow do these things have anything to do with where the story is going? \nLet me give you a word that may be familiar to you. \nRagnarök. \n\nRagnarök, (Old Norse: “Doom of the Gods”), in Scandinavian mythology, the end of the world of gods and men.\n\nOda has stated before that he wants to create another big battle which will leave the war at marineford in the shadows. What better place could there be than the island with the strongest army in the whole one piece World. \n\nAnd at this point I personally think the fight between blackbeard and shanks is inevitable. \n\nNow that blackbeard has coby the marines may also come after him. \n\nAn all out war between two yonkos is already big enough but the location of the battle may lead to other party's getting involved in the battle. My gut has been telling me for a long time we will see shanks on elbaf and also my gut has been telling me that shanks will die by the hands of blackbeard. \"The sun will be darkened, the stars will vanish, and the earth will sink into the sea\" \n\nThe sun or the sun God Nika will be darkened, we saw how he felt when ace died infront of him and he couldn't do anything to save him. Should this happen again but this time with shanks I think luffy would go in a similar mode where he can't comprehend reality. The darkness will over come and the world will sink into the sea.\" Afterward, the earth will rise again, the innocent Balder will return from the dead,\" \n\nAt this point where everything seems lost, ruffy will awaken his devil fruit again, we will have joyboy bring back the earth and lighten up the darkness \n\nThere are different varieties to the end of ragnarök. One of them says that alot of people will die in the battle but after the battle is over yggdrasil the world tree will be unharmed and two people will emerge from the tree. Lif and lifthrasir (life and vitality) with their powers they will give back life to those who lost it.",

The ancient weapons are named after Greco Roman Gods. The planets were named after these gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uaknup20kla1.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d3b6016ff72ac35a47e98048f08b7e98ee72d1d\n\nShirahoshi who is Poseidon, named after the Greek God of the Sea, can command Sea Kings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk3bsbh60kla1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cd27ed6b2bc09cb2db08eba2797b0f0a30f56b60\n\nPluton a battle ship capable of destroying the world, is named after the Roman God of the Underworld. It currently rests underneath Wano.\n\nFollowing this logic Saturn should have an ability relating to his namesake god. I believe he will send the straw hats back in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y219qs8z0kla1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5c9b9bd2be649b195f33888b90d0db5329ebcc0a\n\nLike Kuma, I believe that Jay Garcia Saturn is a traitor amongst the Gorosei and will later be an ally. \n\nSaturn regrets killing Clover and also finds it to be truly a shame to have to kill Vegapunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zw7yi8d1kla1.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a18c7ce440e0d145fd21a1f612d454634b88618d\n\n\"Oh Joyboy...

Why does Roger wish to be born in this time? I believe it's because Roger is speaking about the 2nd Joyboy. The tale that Roger read at laughtale, which potentially could be the One Piece, should have talked about the future for Oden and Whitebeard to know about the Great War that will take place 20 years after Oden's death. Prophecy exists to some capacity thanks to Madamme Shyirly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2yeik2o2kla1.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=704917faa3f7ee996531f667341d909e1aba429c\n\nI belive that Luffy will go to the Void Century and will take the role of Joyboy and form a Kingdom of Pirates, becoming the King of Pirates.  \n\nToki will send the Straw Hats into the future at the end of the Void Century. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob81e4hx2kla1.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79c1ef900b7e8338c4c484f3bf13f3578b76a103\n\nWhile the Straw Hats were in the Void Century, Blackbeard would have defeated both Law and Shanks to take all 4 Road Poneglyphs. He would have gone to Laughtale and would have discovered the One Piece. He would become the next pirate king. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgxkch173kla1.png?width=262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b65977b38362bd88ebe2b9336b8eaa1ce142f24d\n\nHe will wage war against the World Government to take over the empty throne.

        "text": "Oda carefully plans everything. Everthing he introduces will serve a big purpose eventually. This is way I think Bonney's sole purpose in the story and why Oda is focusing on her right now is simply to use her ability later.  \nLuffy has gotten much stronger but him and the crew still stand no chance against WG.  \nWe have 3 Admirals, Imu and Seraphims and I am certain that the Elders are gonna be powerful too. It wont make any sense for them to be non-fighters who just sit there menacingly. They all seem like veterans some have scars and weapons.   \nThis is where Bonney  comes in. Oda will use her to even the odds. She will rejuvinate some old heavy hitters. My bet is on Rayleigh and most likely XEBEC.   \nOda did not mention Xebec for no reason. I think he is the man Kidd was after. but he is too old and frail right now. If he was the captain of Whitebeard than he is a really old fart by now.   \nHe will probably make a promise to Bonney that he will destroy the WG she will do so  to avenge her dad.   \nThe war will be balanced if this happens.   \nWho else do you think will become young again during this battle ? Garp  too ?",

The thing or place of the time chamber will allow the weaker members of the straw hats(like usopp) to become a lot more powerful.\n\nEOS Strawhats will all have to be extremely high level, such as usopp being able to defeat yassopp, one of shanks’ top men.\n\nIt will most likely be an island where the atmosphere makes it so that time flows differently than that of the regular time.\n\nThoughts on this or any other way that the Strawhats will become high enough level end of series?",

Below are my current thoughts\n\nLuffy - Gruul\n\nZoro - Rakdos\n\nNami - Boros\n\nUsopp - Golgari\n\nSanji - Simic\n\nChopper - Selesnya\n\nFranky - Izzet\n\nRobin - Azorius\n\nBrook - Orzhov\n\nJinbei - Dimir\n\nI'm not set on having a second Luffy in the deck, and with as many character options as I have available to me, I will probably skip that. Though I also wanted each guild represented by a member of the crew as well. I don't love some of these, but that comes with the territory. I am not opposed to cutting Luffy from above and adding Yamato either.\n\nIf you have other suggestions pertaining to characters in OP and what guild they should be in, I will take those into consideration as well.\n\nFor those wondering, yes Ace will be Sol Ring should that end up in the deck",
