Franchise stalwart Taylor Lewan was released in the offseason and they have a dire need at left tackle.    They also hold Pick No. 11, which is right around the range when we'd probably see tackles going in the draft with names like Peter Skoronski, Paris Johnson Jr, and Broderick Jones.   It feels like the reasonable move at the posistion.\n\nAnd the weird thing is...is that history is on my side for that argument.   \n\nThe Tennesee Titans have had a weirdly easy time to finding their longterm Left Tackle, dating all the way back to their time as the Houston Oilers back in 1984.\n\nIn 1984, the Houston Oilers opened up the 2nd Round of the NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL Players by selecting **Don Maggs** off of the Pittsburgh Maulers.  After spending four years as a backup, Maggs finally ascended to the Oilers' primary starting LT between **1990-1992**\n\nIn 1993, they chose to let Maggs go in the offseason.   Who did the Oilers take in the first round of the 1993 Draft?  That would be **Brad Hopkins**, a offensive tackle out of Illinois.   Brad Hopkins would be an immediate success for Houston becoming the teams primary starting LT during the Oilers final years and into their time in Tennessee, spanning from **1993-2005**\n\nIn 2005, in the second round of the draft, the Titans selected **Michael Roos** out of Eastern Washington.   Roos spent his rookie season alongside Brad Hopkins, as the team's starting right tackle.   But in 2006, Michael Roos succeeded Hopkins as the team's starting left tackle.   A position he held from **2006-2014**\n\nIn 2014, the Titans yet again drafted their long-term Left Tackle in the first round of the 2014 Draft, the above mentioned Taylor Lewan.    Lewan spent his time as Titans starting LT from **2014-2022**\n\nNow, as the draft steadily approaches, all signs point to Tennessee continuing their unusual tradition.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678703470.0},{"title":"[Schefter] Trade is now agreed to, per sources: \ud83c\udfc8Dolphins get Pro Bowl CB Jalen Ramsey. \ud83c\udfc8Rams get 2023 third-round pick (No. 77) and TE Hunter Long.

With an already stacked team the Bills would go on to make the requisite additions to produce what many believed to be the best roster in the NFL. The story of the 2022 Buffalo Bills though, isn\u2019t one that centers on football, instead it focuses on one of the most turbulent NFL seasons in recent history, and the perseverance to simply play through it all.\n\nIt began with the Bills doing everything right. They would bring in Aaron Kromer (OL Coach) and Rodger Saffold (LG) to significantly improve their Offensive Line. In one of the biggest splashes of the offseason they would add future Hall of Famer and legendary pass rusher, Von Miller, to close out games. They would enter the draft with little to no holes on their roster, and fill them with high potential players capable of making major impacts in 2022. And so, it was the beginning of May 2022 and Western New York was buzzing with all the hope and optimism expected of the home of a Super Bowl favorite.\n\nMay 14, 2022. A mass shooter, fueled by racism, took the lives of 10 humans at a Tops Supermarket in the East Side neighborhood of Buffalo, New York. All that buzz around the city quickly dissipated as people simply tried to comprehend what had happened. The City of Good Neighbors would rally together over this tragedy with the professional athletes that call Buffalo home included. Among them were Bills players who would attend memorials, volunteer, help comfort residents, and speak publicly on the topic. Said best by Dion Dawkins in a letter for[ The Players\u2019 Tribune](https:\/\/www.theplayerstribune.com\/posts\/dion-dawkins-buffalo-bills-nfl-football-shooting), \u201cThis is BUFFALO. In other words, this will not break us. This is our home.\u201d\n\nStill raw from the emotional events of May 14, fans and the team expected the summer months to be less devastating. Then, in June, news broke that Bills owner, Kim Pegula, was admitted to intensive care with the reason only recently revealed by her[ daughter](https:\/\/www.theplayerstribune.com\/posts\/jessica-pegula-tennis), cardiac arrest. This was followed by news in mid-August that the brother of Bills Tight End, Dawson Knox, had passed away suddenly at the age of 22. Less than 2 weeks later, before the Bills final preseason game, it was made public that Bills rookie punter, Matt Araiza, had been accused of participating in the gang rape of a minor during his time as SDSU. He was released by the Bills on August 27.\n\nA turbulent offseason would come to an end with Buffalo headed to California to take on the defending Super Bowl champ Los Angeles Rams. In dominating fashion, the Bills would prove Las Vegas oddsmakers right and down the champs in their own house. The following week saw an even more impressive performance by the Bills as they would beat the Titans by 34 points in their home opener. Win number two did come at a cost though as a neck injury sustained by All-Pro Safety, Micah Hyde, would sideline a key part of the Bills defense for the remainder of the season.\n\nIn Week 3 the injuries in the secondary would pile up with Buffalo down 4 of 5 starters in a critical matchup against the division rival Dolphins. Under a heat index north of 100 degrees the Dolphins would be the better team handing the Bills their first loss of the season and seizing control of the AFC East. Buffalo would rebound against the Ravens and Steelers and then take on the Chiefs in the matchups 4th consecutive game in Kansas City. The most anticipated game of the 2022 season would be a back and forth affair that came down to the final drive of the game, where Nickel CB Taron Johnson would intercept Patrick Mahomes to improve the Bills record to 5-1.\n\nAfter an impressive win over the Chiefs the Bills would handedly defeat the Green Bay Packers and then head to New Jersey to take on the upstart New York Jets. The Jets would shock the Bills through an efficient offensive game plan and by applying relentless pressure on Josh Allen. The loss would drop the Bills to 6-2 but even more concerning was a Grade 2 UCL sprain suffered by Josh Allen on his throwing arm. This set up the possibility that Allen would not only miss the Bills home game against the Vikings one week later, but possibly an extended period of time. A game time decision Allen suited up for the Bills against the Vikings and played well in the first half. In the second half things unraveled as Allen committed a few egregious turnovers, Justin Jefferson made an electric play or two, and the Vikings handed the Bills their second consecutive loss.\n\nIn a bit of a slump, the Bills desperately needed a victory over the Cleveland Browns in a game that was set to be played at home on November 20th. Mother Nature had other plans and from November 16 to November 20 a storm would dump over 70 inches of snow on Orchard Park. The deadly storm would take the lives of 11 people, cause power outages throughout Western New York, and make it impossible to play a football game in the area. A last second decision was made to move the game to Detroit and through the help of fans and residents alike all players and staff members were able to make it to Detroit in time for the game. Despite the inability to practice leading up to the game the Bills were able to correct course with a win over the Browns. Just four days later they would return to Ford Field, on Thanksgiving, and beat the Lions in a nail biter which made Josh Allen the first Quarterback in NFL history to win in all three time slots on Thanksgiving. The win would come at a cost though as the Bills would lose their closer, Von Miller, to a torn ACL for the remainder of the 2022 season.\n\nBuffalo would coax through their next 4 games which included victories over the Patriots, Jets, Dolphins, and Bears, the latter of which resulted in Buffalo clinching their 3rd consecutive AFC East Title. With Buffalo controlling the #1 seed in the AFC all eyes were set on a pivotal matchup between them and the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2, 2023. The game began as expected with both the Bengals and Bills exchanging scoring drives with Cincinnati driving on their second possession of the game. On a short pass to Tee Higgins, Bills Safety Damar Hamlin would come forward and make a routine tackle on the play. Hamlin would stand up. Hamlin would collapse.\n\nThe scenes that followed were unlike any we have seen in the modern NFL. With trainers rushing to help Damar Hamlin there were looks of fear and disbelief on every player and staff member on the field. Damar Hamlin\u2019s heart had stopped, and trainers were attempting lifesaving CPR on the 24-year-old in front of an audience of millions. Hamlin would be loaded into an ambulance and rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center as his teammates and opponents would head to their respective locker rooms. In one of the more surreal moments in NFL history the Bills and Bengals made the joint decision to end the game out of concern for a player.\n\nOver the next few days Hamlin\u2019s family, Bills players, and Bills fans were joined by millions in holding their breath waiting for news regarding Damar Hamlin\u2019s condition. Pseudo-doctors would pop up everywhere providing fictitious prognoses until 3 days later when Hamlin\u2019s actual doctors held a press conference. In that presser his doctors confirmed that he had suffered cardiac arrest on the field, was saved by the on-field medical staff (Including Denny Kellington) and was slowly approaching stable condition. While in intensive care, a charity for a toy drive which Hamlin had started began to receive donations. He would ultimately leave the hospital on January 11, with that toy drive the beneficiary of nearly $9,000,000 in donations.\n\nAs concern for Hamlin\u2019s health shifted to optimism, so too did the focus shift back to football. The NFL made the decision to cancel the Bills and Bengals game and put to a vote a new framework for determining home field advantage in the NFL playoffs. That measure was passed, though the Bills[ abstained](https:\/\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/2023\/01\/09\/damar-hamlin-bills-peter-king-fmia-week-18\/) from voting, prior to the Bills season finale against the Patriots. In one of the most emotional atmospheres in sports history the Patriots would kickoff to begin the game. In storybook fashion that kickoff would be returned by Nyheim Hines from his own end zone for a Touchdown. Later in that same game Hines would return a 2nd kick and the Bills would go on to win said game, setting up their 3rd game of the season against the Dolphins, this time in the Wildcard round of the playoffs.\n\nThat playoff game would begin much as everyone expected with the Bills jumping out to a three-score lead. A few Bills mishaps would make the game a bit dicey with Miami even gaining the lead briefly but ultimately the Bills would find a way to win. This would set up a replay of the game against the Bengals, this time in Buffalo. Damar Hamlin would attend that game and even make an appearance on the jumbotron from his box seats, but that would be the highlight of the game for Buffalo. From the jump the Bills appeared outmatched and whether it be a talent discrepancy, play calling, conditions, fatigue, or some combination of all, the Bengals would go on to end the Bills season.\n\nBy all accounts the preseason Super Bowl favorites failing to make their respective Conference Title game is a disappointment, Bills players and fans can attest to that. There were plenty of points this season where the on-field product didn\u2019t live up to the hype and simply wasn\u2019t good enough. It would also be unfair to simply disregard the undercurrent of negative occurrences that surrounded this team since day one, most of which were out of the team\u2019s control. In movies stories of perseverance often result in fairy tale endings, in reality sometimes just playing through it all is the most you can ask.\n\n# Roster Changes\n\n## TRADES\n\n* BUF gets **Case Keenum (QB)**, CLE gets **2022 Pick #246** *(03\/19)*\n\nAfter former NVP Mitchell Trubisky signed with the Steelers the Bills were in need of a backup Quarterback. They would remedy this by trading a 2022 7th round pick (which became C Dawson Deaton) to the Browns for Case Keenum. Keenum didn\u2019t see much playing time in Buffalo (for obvious short-wearing reasons), but in the 2 games he did see the field he would complete 2 passes on 7 attempts for 8 yards. Underwhelming, but he was a backup, what more could you expect?\n\n* BUF gets **2023 Pick #139**, ARZ gets **Cody Ford (OL)** *(08\/22)*\n\nA necessary trade for the Buffalo Bills. Cody Ford, a former 2nd round pick who performed well below expectations, gets flipped to the Cardinals in exchange for a 5th round pick. In Arizona Ford would receive an overall PFF grade of 41.2 while playing 350 snaps, allowing 3 sacks, and committing 2 penalties.\n\n* BUF gets **Nyheim Hines (RB)**, IND gets **Zack Moss (RB) + 2023 Pick #164** *(11\/01)*\n\nIn a trade executed as close to the NFL\u2019s trade deadline as possible, the Bills offloaded former 3rd round pick Zack Moss, an underperforming RB compared to his initial promise, and a conditional 6th round pick, which became a 5th, to the Colts for Nyheim Hines. Hines performed well for the Bills as both a punt and kick returner. In the Bills season finale he would return 2 kicks for Touchdowns including an emotional one on the first play of the game. Moss would see playing time for the Colts producing 365 rushing yards on 76 attempts, good for a 4.8 Y\/A.\n\n* BUF gets **Dean Marlowe (S)**, ATL gets **2023 Pick #247** *(11\/01)*\n\nThe Bills *other* trade deadline acquisition involved an old acquaintance making his return. Dean Marlowe, who played for Buffalo from 2017 to 2020, was brought back to the Bills in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons in return for a 7th round pick. Much like Hines, Marlowe saw limited action but made the best of his time on the field. He appeared in just 6 games but had a critical interception in the Bills wildcard round victory over the Miami Dolphins.\n\n## FREE AGENCY \/ CLAIMS\n\n* **Rodger Saffold**\\*, LG, 1-year $6.25m (03\/09)\\*\n\nThe Bills brought Rodger Saffold to Buffalo, after a Pro-Bowl season in Tennessee, to shore up a below average Offensive Line. He would go on to play over 1000 snaps and earn his second straight trip to the Pro-Bowl, but wouldn\u2019t live up to expectations. The Bills line would struggle as much, if not more so, than it did in years past, ultimately collapsing in the divisional round against the Bengals. All signs point to Saffold continuing his career but whether or not that is in Buffalo remains to be seen.\n\n* **Shaq Lawson**\\*, DE, 1-year $1.19m (03\/12)\\*\n\nShaq Lawson was one of a couple retreads for the Bills. He returned to Buffalo to improve their pass rush, something which had been lacking in years past. He would produce, including a few massive sacks and major contributions on multiple goal line stands. His importance to the 2022 Buffalo Bills cannot be understated, especially after Von Miller\u2019s season ending injury.\n\n* **Jordan Phillips**\\*, DT, 1-year $5.0m (03\/12)\\*\n\nJordan Phillips was the other Defensive Line retread for the Bills, and while injuries plagued him, he made his presence known in the trenches. On limited snap counts he would produce, putting up relatively decent numbers including 1.5 sacks and 4.5 stuffs.\n\n* **Tim Settle**\\*, DT, 2-years $9.0m (03\/12)\\*\n\nSettle had an underwhelming 2022 for the Bills. Signed as a promising Defensive Tackle, he went relatively unnoticed against both the run and pass. When that occurs on a Defensive Line where Von Miller is commanding double teams it exacerbates concerns. Settle is still under contract for the Bills in 2023 and assuming that contract isn\u2019t altered expectations will be that he significantly improves in his second season in Buffalo.\n\n* **Von Miller**\\*, DE, 6-years $120.0m (03\/13)\\*\n\nThe prize of the offseason, Von Miller was brought to Buffalo to do one thing, close out games. On multiple occasions Miller would do just that and in the process make the rest of the Defensive Line look much better, especially Greg Rousseau. Despite missing a large portion of the season due to a torn ACL, Miller was worth every penny. Set to return to the Bills at some point in the 2023 season, expectations will be for him to continue the dominance he displayed this past year.\n\n* **O.J. Howard**\\*, TE, 1-year $3.5m (03\/13)\\*\n\nThe O.J. Howard signing was one many thought was a major addition. 12 and 02 personnel packages were potentially on the table with the Bills now able to pair Dawson Knox with a comparable Tight End. Those ideas fell apart rather quickly though as Howard was cut after the preseason, leaving to sign with the Texans. Howard joins many players of the past in a group known as the \u201cwhat could have been Bills Legends\u201d.\n\n* **Duke Johnson**\\*, RB, 1-year $0.32m (03\/16)\\*\n\nDuke Johnson was brought in to compete for a role as a backup RB and\/or return specialist. He wouldn\u2019t win either job and would spend the season on the Bills practice squad being elevated and appearing in just one game for Buffalo.\n\n* **Greg Mancz**\\*, OL, 1-year $1.27m (03\/16)\\*\n\nGreg Mancz was signed to compete for a swing IOL role. While he wouldn\u2019t earn an active roster spot, he would find his way onto the Bills Practice Squad and appear in 27 snaps for the Bills in 2022.\n\n* **DaQuan Jones,** DL, 2-year, $14.00m (03\/16)\n\nThe Bills spent a fair amount of money in the 2022 offseason, the signing of DaQuan Jones may have been the best value. The former Titans Defensive Tackle was brought to Buffalo to shore up an interior Defensive Line that has needed reinforcements for years. As a 1-Tech, Jones dominated in the trenches for Buffalo appearing in 61% of the teams defensive snaps this past season.\n\n* **Matt Barkley**\\*, QB, 1-year $1.15m (03\/16)\\*\n\nMatt Barkley returned to the Bills as a reserve quarterback for approximately 29.5 bitcoin. He would spend the entire season on the Bills practice squad as a valuable asset in the locker room with no tangible on field impact.\n\n* **Jamison Crowder**\\*, WR, 1-year $2.0m (03\/18)\\*\n\nIn the wake of losing slot WR, Cole Beasley, the Bills looked to Jamison Crowder. Early in the season he filled the part well, but after breaking his ankle in Week 4 Crowder would be lost for the season.\n\n* **David Quessenberry**\\*, OL, 1-year $1.75m (04\/16)\\*\n\nDavid Quessenberry was brought to Buffalo to be a swing tackle\/guard. He would appear in 36% of the team\u2019s offensive snaps and play adequately during his time on the field.\n\n* **Greg Van Roten**\\*, OL, 1-year $1.27m (06\/08)\\*\n\nGreg Van Roten was a similar addition to the Bills as David Quessenberry. Coming from the Jets, Van Roten was the Bills swing IOL appearing in 33% of the team\u2019s offensive snaps this past season.\n\n* **Xavier Rhodes**\\*, CB, 1-year $1.12m (09\/28)\\*\n\nAfter a slew of injuries in the secondary the Bills looked at veteran free agents. This brought Xavier Rhodes to the Bills where he would appear in 2 games, starting 1, before being cut and signed by the Cowboys.\n\n* **A.J. Klein**\\*, LB, 1-year $1.12m (11\/17)\\*\n\nA little over 2 weeks after trading Roquan Smith the Bears would move on from another linebacker in A.J. Klein. The Bills would claim Klein off waivers as LB depth. He would appear in 169 total snaps for the Bills as a reserve linebacker and special teamer.\n\n* **John Brown**\\*, WR, 1-year $0.36m (11\/26)\\*\n\nThe Smokeshow made its way to Western New York due to the Bills WR core starring in the newest episode of NFL Grey\u2019s Anatomy midway through the season. Isaiah McKenzie, Jamison Crowder, Jake Kumerow, and others suffered with injuries and with the Giants poaching Isaiah Hodgins the Bills were left with 3 healthy receivers in November. Thus an old friend made his return to Buffalo in John \u201cSmoke\u201d Brown. While not the receiver he once was, Brown still showed the speed to beat DBs deep, finishing the season with just 1 catch for a 42-yard touchdown in the Bills season finale.\n\n* **Cole Beasley**\\*, WR, 1-year $0.36m (12\/13)\\*\n\nAnother receiver that made his return to the Bills mid-season was Cole Beasley. After a brief stint in Tompa Bay and an even shorter retirement Beasley was added to the Bills practice squad as an option at slot WR. When he saw the field Beasley did produce, and though he split time with Khalil Shakir, Beasley did shore up a position of need for the Bills.\n\n## DRAFT\n\n* *Round 1, Pick 23:* **Kaiir Elam**, *CB, Florida*\n\nDespite not playing the expected snaps of a 1st round pick, Kaiir Elam has a quietly impressive rookie season. With injuries affecting the entire Bills secondary all season, including Elam, he still put together a statistically significant season. This included a massive red zone interception of Patrick Mahomes and the game-sealing pass deflection in the wildcard round of the playoffs.\n\n* *Round 2, Pick 63:* **James Cook**, *RB, Georgia*\n\nJames Cook underwent the typical progression of rookies under the McDermott umbrella; limited minutes early, sloppy play at times, heating up at the end of the season. In playing a complementary role to Devin Singletary, the Bills use of Cook allowed them to generate an efficient rushing attack towards the end of the season. Cook had his flashes and is definitely a player worth keeping an eye on heading into 2023.\n\n* *Round 3, Pick 89:* **Terrel Bernard**, *LB, Baylor*\n\nA puzzling pick at the time, Bernard would go on to have an unimpressive rookie season. He didn\u2019t see much playing time on the defensive side of the ball and late in the season was even jumped on the depth chart by Bills waiver claim, A.J. Klein. Bernard\u2019s potential does seem limited on defense but there does seem to be a plan for the Linebacker out of Baylor, providing an [argument](https:\/\/www.cover1.net\/buffalo-bills-terrel-bernard\/) for why he was drafted.\n\n* *Round 5, Pick 148:* **Khalil Shakir**, *WR, Boise State*\n\nBuffalo had a 4th round grade on Khalil Shakir and were able to snag him in the 5th round. The result was a slew of angry phone calls to Brandon Beane from other GMs, and a rookie who showed flashes throughout the 2022 season. Though he was provided limited opportunities, Shakir proved capable of getting open and hauling in receptions all over the field. The ability to play both inside and out increases Shakir\u2019s potential and provides him an all but guaranteed spot on the Bills moving forward.\n\n* *Round 6, Pick 180:* **Matt Araiza**, *P, San Diego State*\n\nMoving on. (In hindsight, Ryan Stonehouse would have been a better selection\u2026)\n\n* *Round 6, Pick 185:* **Christian Benford**, *DB, Villanova*\n\nSurprise! The McBeane administration took a flier on another lesser known DB late in the draft, and he might be a stud! Levi Wallace, Damar Hamlin, Dane Jackson, and now Christian Benford, a 6th round pick out of Villanova who balled out from the jump. Unfortunately, his season would be cut relatively short due to a fractured hand, only playing 1 game thereafter. Still, Benford looks like the type of DB that both Brandon Beane and Sean McDermott covet, with a move to Safety not being out of the question.\n\n* *Round 6, Pick 209:* **Luke Tenuta**, *OL, Virginia Tech*\n\nLuke Tenuta\u2019s tenure in Buffalo didn\u2019t last long, despite him being Brandon Beane\u2019s favorite style of linemen, an abnormally large one. He would be cut on the last day of cutdowns with the goal to bring him back to the Bills practice squad. That wouldn\u2019t happen though as the Colts would poach him through waivers.\n\n* *Round 7, Pick 231:* **Baylon Spector**, *LB, Clemson*\n\nDespite his late round selection, Baylon Spector made the roster and performed admirably when he saw the field, primarily on special teams. His future projects to continue in that role though there is an outside chance he competes for the Bills currently open MLB role as an athletic, instinctual, undersized linebacker.\n\n## KEY UNDRAFTED FREE AGENTS\n\n* **Raheem Blackshear**\\*, RB, Virginia Tech\\*\n\nRaheem Blackshear became a cult favorite in Buffalo after an impressive preseason. Unable to crack the active roster, Blackshear was relegated to the Bills practice squad. He would last there for three weeks before being poached by the Panthers. Blackshear would finish the season with 170 scrimmage yards and 3 touchdowns for the Panthers as a player that clearly has a future in the NFL.\n\n* **Kingsley Jonathan**\\*, DE, Syracuse\\*\n\nKingsley Jonathan was one of many players claimed from the Buffalo Bills. The Bears were the ones to take Jonathan who later appeared in 5 games for them. He would make his way back to Buffalo later in the season and is currently on a futures contract. He\u2019s a sneaky player to watch for that has flashed impressive talent. Don\u2019t be surprised if he finds his way onto the Bills active roster in 2023.\n\n* **Ja\u2019Marcus Ingram**\\*, CB, Buffalo\\*\n\nIn Week #3 of the 2022 season the Bills were so banged up in the secondary that Ja\u2019Marcus Ingram was their CB2 at points. By no means elite, Ingram held his own when appearing for Buffalo and looks to be a fixture on their Practice Squad for the next few seasons.\n\n## KEY ROSTER LOSSES\n\n## Offense\n\n* **Daryl Williams**, *OL, RETIRED*\n\nDaryl Williams spent 2 years in Buffalo before becoming a cap casualty during the 2022 offseason. Williams was a consistent contributor at both Guard and Tackle even earning an All-Pro vote in 2020.\n\n* **Jon Feliciano**, *OL, Signed with Giants*\n\nJon Feliciano spent 3 years in Buffalo and like Daryl Williams was a cap casualty during the 2022 offseason. Feliciano played all 3 IOL positions during his tenure in Buffalo but upon his release seemed exceptionally critical of how the Buffalo Bills operate.\n\n* **Mitchell Trubisky**, *QB, Signed with Steelers*\n\nMitch Trubisky came to Buffalo on a 1-year flier to rehab his value. A few teams were enamored with him after he spent a year in Buffalo with Josh Allen and Brian Daboll leading to the Pittsburgh Steelers taking a chance on him as a possible starting Quarterback.\n\n* **Matt Breida**, *RB, Signed with Giants*\n\nMatt Breida\u2019s speed was believed to be a potentially dominant asset in Buffalo. That never came to fruition. After an uneventful year with the Bills, Breida moved on to the Giants along with Bills Offensive Coordinator Brian Daboll.\n\n* **Cole Beasley**, *WR, Signed with Buccaneers*\n\nTension had been building for more than a year for Cole Beasley in Buffalo. Josh Allen\u2019s pressure release valve asked for his release and was subsequently let go. Buffalo would have issues filling that role throughout 2022 and ultimately bring back Beasley after he expressed interest in a reunion.\n\n* **Emmanuel Sanders**, *WR, RETIRED*\n\nAfter a solid season as the Bills WR2 in Buffalo, Emmanuel Sanders elected to retire as opposed to continuing his career. Losing Sanders was viewed as a blessing in disguise by allowing Gabe Davis to see more playing time. Whether or not that blessing provided benefits remains debatable.\n\n## Defense\n\n* **Levi Wallace**, *CB, Signed with Steelers*\n\nA McBeane steal, Levi Wallace went from a UDFA to 4-year starter in Buffalo at CB. After consulting the color of his [shorts](https:\/\/steelersdepot.com\/2022\/03\/levi-wallace-was-on-the-fence-about-leaving-buffalo-until-he-got-a-sign-to-come-to-pittsburgh\/) Wallace elected to move on from Buffalo and sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n* **Efe Obada**, *DE, Signed with Commanders*\n\nThe long-armed raw Nigerian prospect was an integral part of the Buffalo Bills Defensive End rotation in 2021. In 2022 Efe Obada would sign in Washington and put together a solid 4.0 Sack, 24 Tackle season.\n\n* **Jerry Hughes**, *DE, Signed with Texans*\n\nThe longest tenured Bill heading into the 2022 offseason, Jerry Hughes would leave Buffalo and head to the Texans after 9 seasons with the franchise. Von Miller would be brought in specifically as an upgrade for Hughes but come the end of 2022 Jerry would finish with more sacks (for more than one reason).\n\n* **Mario Addison**, *DE, Signed with Texans*\n\nMario Addison joined Jerry Hughes on his move to the Texans. After 12.0 sacks over 2 seasons with the Bills Addison would have just 1.0 sack with the Texans in 12 appearances.\n\n* **Harrison Phillips**, *DT, Signed with Vikings*\n\nMaybe the biggest loss for the Bills on the defensive side of the ball, beloved Defensive Tackle moved on to join the Minnesota Vikings. A 3rd Round Pick in 2018, Phillips showed flashes of dominance in Buffalo with injuries hampering his progression. In Minnesota he continued to play well and was even a massive part of the Fumble Return Touchdown that arguably resulted in the Vikings beating the Bills during the 2022 season.\n\n* **Star Lotulelei**, *DT, UNSIGNED*\n\nOne of the bigger busts as far as signings have gone in the McBeane era, Star Lotulelei never lived up to expectations as a solid 1T-DT for the Bills. He would be cut in cap savings efforts after the 2021 season and not find work elsewhere. He has yet to formally announce his retirement.\n\n* **Vernon Butler**, *DT, Signed with Raiders*\n\nVernon Butler was another let down of a signing in the IDL for the Bills and left for the Raiders following the 2021 season. He would end up playing just 1 game in 2022, for the Giants, having 4 tackles in that effort.\n\n* **A.J. Klein**, *LB, Signed with Giants*\n\nA.J. Klein was a reserve linebacker during his time for the Bills but wasn\u2019t in their plans for the 2022 season. He would become a part of that plan later in the season though as injuries saw the Bills claim Klein to hold down the fort while the Bills tried to bide their time.\n\n## Special Teams\n\n* **Matt Haack**, *P, Signed with Colts*\n\nMatt Haack struggled in 2021 for the Bills so Buffalo happily let him walk looking for improvements at a relatively unused position for the team. Haack in his own right played well in 2022 though, having one of the best seasons of his career for the underwhelming Indianapolis Colts.\n\n# Stats\n\nFurther details for both Team Stats and Individual Stats for the 2022 Buffalo Bills season can be found [here](https:\/\/www.pro-football-reference.com\/teams\/buf\/2022.htm).\n\n## OFFENSIVE STATS\n\n|Stat|**Value**|**Avg\/Game**|2022 Rank|2021 Rank|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Total Yds**|6361|397.6|\\#2\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#5|\n|**Pass Yds**|4129|258.1|\\#7\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#9|\n|**Rush Yds**|2232|139.5|\\#7\ud83d\udd3b|\\#6|\n|**Points Scored**|455|28.4|\\#2\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#3|\n|**Pass TDs**|35|2.2|\\#2\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#7|\n|**Rush TDs**|15|0.9|\\#15\ud83d\udd3b|\\#7|\n|**1st Downs**|367|22.9|\\#2\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#4|\n|**TUrnovers**|27|1.7|\\#31\ud83d\udd3b|\\#13|\n|**INT Thrown**|14|0.9|\\#21\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#25|\n|**Fumbles Lost**|13|0.8|\\#31\ud83d\udd3b|\\#4|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## DEFENSIVE STATS\n\n|Stat|Value|Avg\/Game|2022 Rank|2021 Rank|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Total Yds Allowed**|5106|319.1|\\#6\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Pass Yds Allowed**|3433|214.6|\\#15\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Rush Yds Allowed**|1673|104.6|\\#5\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#13|\n|**Points Against**|286|17.9|\\#2\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Pass TDs Allowed**|21|1.3|\\#13\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Rush TDs Allowed**|10|0.6|\\#7\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#26|\n|**1st Downs Allowed**|313|19.6|\\#17\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Takeaways**|27|1.7|\\#4\ud83d\udd3b|\\#3|\n|**INT Forced**|17|1.1|\\#4\ud83d\udd3b|\\#3|\n|**Fumbles**|10|0.6|\\#10\ud83d\udd3b|\\#6|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## SPECIAL TEAMS STATS\n\n|Stat|Value|Avg\/Game|2022 Rank|2021 Rank|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**FGs Made**|27|1.7|\\#16\ud83d\udd3b|\\#13|\n|**FG %**|87.1%||\\#12\ud83d\udd3b|\\#11|\n|**XPs Made**|48|3.0|\\#2|\\#2|\n|**XP %**|96.0%||\\#15\ud83d\udd3b|\\#1|\n|**Punts**|46|2.9|\\#1\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#6|\n|**Yards per Punt**|46.7||\\#16\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#31|\n|**Net Yards per Punt**|41.2||\\#15\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#31|\n|**Opp. Drive Start**|27.9||\\#9\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f|\\#17|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Weekly Game Recaps\n\nWeekly Game Recaps [HERE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11q5nkp\/comment\/jc1f31d\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# Roster Review\n\nRoster Review [HERE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11q5nkp\/comment\/jc1f7st\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n## ACCOLADES AND AWARDS\n\n## Players of the Week\/Month\n\n* **OPOW:** Josh Allen (WK5, WK6, WK15)\n* **DPOW:** Jordan Poyer (WK4), Matt Milano (WK11), Ed Oliver (WK12)\n* **STPOW:** Nyheim Hines (WK18)\n* **STPOM:** Tyler Bass (November)\n\n## All-Pros\n\n* **1st Team:** Matt Milano (LB, 85)\n* **2nd Team:** Stefon Diggs (WR, 74)\n* **Others:** Josh Allen (QB, 15), Tremaine Edmunds (LB, 2), Jordan Poyer (S, 25), Tyler Bass (K, 4), Nyheim Hines (KR, 23)\n\n## Pro-Bowl Selections\n\n* **Starters:** Josh Allen, Stefon Diggs, Mitch Morse, Jordan Poyer\n* **Alternates:** Dion Dawkins (1), Dawson Knox (1), Matt Milano (1), Tremaine Edmunds (1), Rodger Saffold (2), Tyler Bass (2), Tyler Matakevich (3), Reid Ferguson (3), Reggie Gilliam (3), Greg Rousseau (4), Ed Oliver (4), Siran Neal (5)\n\n# Front Office\/Coaching Staff Review\n\nFront Office\/Coaching Staff Review [HERE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11q5nkp\/comment\/jc1f9ij\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# 2023 Buffalo Bills\n\n## TENTATIVE KEY ROSTER LOSSES\n\nTentative Key Roster Losses [HERE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11q5nkp\/comment\/jc1fad6\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n## DRAFT PICKS\n\n* Round 1, Pick 27 (#27 Overall)\n* Round 2, Pick 28 (#59 Overall)\n* Round 3, Pick 28 (#91 Overall)\n* Round 4, Pick 29 (#130 Overall)\n* Round 5, Pick 5 (#139 Overall)\n* Round 6, Pick 30 (#205 Overall)\n\n## POSSIBLE OPTIONS AT PICK #27\n\n* **Nolan Smith**, EDGE, *Georgia*\n\nThis may be a stretch but consider it with an open mind. The Bills have thrived off of extremely raw, underdeveloped prospects with high potential. If the Bills must go Front-7 for the umpteenth time, Nolan Smith may be the pick. The number one prospect in the nation coming out of high school he flashed at Georgia. He also just dominated the Combine, putting up inhuman numbers for a guy his size. While few Bills fans want to see another Edge rusher in the first-round, especially after all the other ones turned out *so well*, if they are going to do it, Smith is the guy to do it with.\n\n* **O\u2019Cyrus Torrence**, G, *Florida*\n\nO\u2019Cyrus Torrence is currently the desired pick of most Bills fans, and on surface, it\u2019s clear why. Seen as the best guard in the draft, Torrence is a 6 '5'' 347 lb. monster who is known to flat out ragdoll defenders as a run-blocking, mauling o-lineman. He didn\u2019t surrender a sack in his 4-year career of over 3000 snaps. However, despite being a good pass protector, Torrence is susceptible to speed rushers, and struggles with Blitzes. If the Bills are really intent on protecting the 258 million dollar man, Torrence is definitely worth a look.\n\n* **Bijan Robinson**, RB, *Texas*\n\nA lot of NFL fans seem to have a passionate stance on drafting running backs in the 1st Round. To the ones adamantly against doing so know that Bijan Robinson is the real deal. A powerful runner with every juke, truck, stiff-arm and spin in his bag of tricks, Robinson is a home-run threat from the moment he touches the ball. A somewhat close comparison is a more physical Saquon. Both dudes who could take on a full defense effortlessly. The major difference being Saquon was more of a get around or over you kinda guy, while Bijan prefers to go around or through you. Regardless, if he is the selection at 27, Bills fans shouldn\u2019t be upset, because he is the absolute cream of the crop in terms of RB prospects.\n\n* **Antonio Johnson**, S, *Texas A&M*\n\nWith the Bills set to lose Safety Jordan Poyer this offseason, if the Bills really wanted to draft some more Defense, Texas A&M\u2019s Antonio Johnson is worth considering. Johnson is a great run-defender, more than willing to engage RBs and others. He is a quick Safety with a high football I.Q, which is something Bills Head Coach Sean McDermott desires. His only real weaknesses are his troubles taking receivers deep and his known susceptibility to fall for double-moves. Johnson though could fill a need making him an option a pick #27.\n\n* **Jordan Addison**, WR, *USC*\n\nAn athletic, speedy receiver with great route-running skill, USC WR Jordan Addison possesses all the skills to dominate at the next level. Whether at his previous home in Pitt, or in USC with Caleb Williams, Addison shined in college, winning the 2021 Biletnikoff award as the nation\u2019s top receiver. Addison is very undersized for the position at 5\u201911\u201d, so he would mainly be a slot WR, but if the Bills managed to land Addison, their offense would look different overnight. Definitely a prospect the Bills should consider, as Addison in the Bills offense would be a home run threat\n\n* **Zay Flowers**, WR, *Boston College*\n\nThe second Wide Receiver to make this list, Boston College\u2019s Zay Flowers is more of a catch-and-run receiver. Despite his smaller size, he is known to be a hellacious blocker and extremely physical, and adding a ton of muscle mass since his last college game will only add to that strength. Much like Jordan Addison, Flowers is still a little undersized. However, the two play two extremely different roles in an offense, with Addison playing the slot deep threat role, while Flowers would likely play more of a Beasley-esque safety blanket role for Allen, being able to run all different kinds of routes with some level of precision.\n\n# Final Thoughts & Acknowledgements\n\nWriting this piece each year can be an arduous task, one that would be impossible if not for the team of writers behind it. For the third year u\/ashth3great31 has provided an incredible Roster and Staff Review while u\/ThisisSportacus is in their second year providing an insightful look at roster changes and possible 1st Round draft selections. I can\u2019t thank both of them enough for taking so much time out of their busy schedules to contribute to something which provides little tangible reward.\n\nI\u2019d also like to thank the people who take the time to not only consume posts like this but also fan produced content in general. As someone who dedicates, far too much, time to producing content for NFL fans throughout the year I can say definitively that what makes it most worth it is the people who consume it.\n\nAs for this Bills season, it\u2019s unlike any I\u2019ve experienced before. On the one hand I really felt like \u201cthis is our year\u201d while on the other I found myself just waiting for the next shoe to drop on what felt like a cursed season. While it was by no means a success for the Bills on the field, I take some solace in knowing that if even a few things hadn\u2019t unfolded the way they did it could have been much much worse.\n\nSo to close this out I\u2019ll ask one thing of non-Bills fans and another of Bills fans for the 2023 season. To the non-Bills fans please, I beg of you, sleep on this team. They are no good, they are regressing, they won\u2019t win the AFC East, they won\u2019t even make the playoffs, they will probably even have a Top-10 pick! For Bills fans my ask is that you heed a short and succinct suggestion from your Franchise Quarterback, Josh Allen.\n\nIgnore them.\n\n*Go Bills,* u\/UberHansen","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678701981.0},{"title":"[Optimistic Jets] Josh Allen on Aaron Rodgers: \"I think he's too competitive to not do anything...

(Sorry Jaguars - it defaults to the bottom team over that time.)\n\nTo help get into the headspace of Giants fans, while we know we can\u2019t complain because we have two Super Bowl wins this side of the 20th century, we also haven\u2019t had any post season success since. Here\u2019s how the Giants have faired since their last Super Bowl:\n\n|Year|Record|Division Finish\/Playoffs|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2012|9-7|2nd, no playoffs|\n|2013|7-9|3rd, no playoffs|\n|2014|6-10|3rd, no playoffs|\n|2015|6-10|3rd, no playoffs|\n|2016|11-5|2nd, lost in Wild Card|\n|2017|3-13|4th, no playoffs|\n|2018|5-11|4th, no playoffs|\n|2019|4-12|3rd, no playoffs|\n|2020|6-10|2rd, no playoffs|\n|2021|4-13|4th, no playoffs|\n\nThe Giants had a winning record twice in a decade, with one short trip to the playoffs. During this time, the Giants have had four head coaches - Tom Coughlin, Ben McAdoo, Pat Shurmur, and Joe Judge - and little to show for it. [Every season from 2016 to 2021, the Giants started 0-2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NFCEastMemeWar\/comments\/wqyx11\/one_of_my_favorite_traditions\/). And that was the *hopeful* part of the season.\n\nComing Into the 2022 Season\n\nAfter an abysmal showing in 2021 featuring a game with a QB sneak on *consecutive downs* inside their own 10 yard line, a game where the Giants finished with negative ten passing yards, and our left tackle scoring more touchdowns than our shiny new WRs on the season with a total of [one](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/must-see-play-315-pound-andrew-thomas-catches-td-from-daniel-jones-giants-vs-buc), HC Joe Judge was fired and GM Dave Gettleman was allowed to resign.\n\nHowever, 2022 was primed to be even worse as Gettleman had left the cap situation messy. The Giants were more than $5 million over the cap and were unable to sign their draft class, let alone any veteran talent. The offensive line was decimated by injury, the wide receiver room was decimated by injury, and we had a number of veteran players that we couldn\u2019t afford to keep. Difficult decisions had to be made, and John Mara had to hire someone to make those decisions.\n\n**Staff Changes**\n\nGM: Joe Schoen, former assistant GM for the Buffalo Bills from 2017-2022.\n\nHC: Brian Daboll, also from the Buffalo Bills, where he was their Offensive Coordinator, game planner, and play caller from 2018-2022 and won the AP Assistant Coach of the Year in 2020. Daboll has five Super Bowl rings from his time with the New England Patriots. Daboll went to Alabama in 2017, where he coached both Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa and helped Alabama win the National Championship before moving to Buffalo.\n\nOC: Mike Kafka, former quarterback coach and passing game coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs. Mike spent three years as an assistant coach for Kansas City, before being promoted for his last two years. This is Mike\u2019s sixth year coaching in the league, and his first year as an OC and playcaller.\n\nDC: Don \u201cWink\u201d Martindale, former defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens. Known for a blitz-heavy defense, Wink made decent use of his players to cover each other\u2019s weaknesses. Wink was DC for the Ravens for four years, and worked as an assistant for six years prior. Wink\u2019s defenses have never ranked lower than 8th in yards allowed against the run or the pass.\n\n**2022 Draft**\n\n*Round 1, Pick #5:* **Kayvon Thibodeaux**, *EDGE, Oregon*. Kayvon fell in the draft due to a perceived lack of effort, and the Giants scooped him up at five. Functioning as the \u201ccan opener\u201d of the defense, Kayvon\u2019s speed off the snap led to four sacks, two forced fumbles - both recovered and [one for a touchdown](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dhioAVDGtAk) \\- and five passes defended. It wasn\u2019t a highlight-filled season, but his presence helped open up opportunities for Dexter Lawrence, Azeez Ojulari, and Leonard Williams.\n\n*Round 1, Pick #7:* **Evan Neal**, *OT, Alabama*. The transition from college to the NFL proved tough for Neal, who\u2019s rookie year was filled with brutal mistakes, giving up pressures and sacks, and an ankle injury he couldn\u2019t seem to shake. Evan was decent in run protection, but was a liability in pass protection. Hopefully he\u2019s able to take the off season to work on his footwork and speed off the snap so he can improve from his bottom 5 PFF ranking.\n\n*Round 2, Pick #43*: **Wan\u2019Dale Robinson**, *WR, Kentucky*. Wan\u2019Dale walked into arguably the most crowded yet unproductive WR room in the NFL. Our highest paid WR, Kenny Golladay, was averaging over a million dollars per catch, both Sterling Shepard and last year\u2019s first round pick Kadarius Toney couldn\u2019t stay healthy enough to see the field, and Darius Slayton has a penchant for dropping game-sealing passes. Wan'Dale tore his ACL Week 11.\n\n*Round 3, Pick #67:* **Joshua Ezeudu**, *OL, North Carolina*. The offensive line for the Giants needs a lot of work, with consistent injuries and a lack of quality starters. The Giants entered the 2022 season with one starting OL - LT Andrew Thomas. Joshua would injure his neck Week 10, and would play Week 11 but miss the rest of the season.\n\n*Round 3, Pick #81*: **Cor\u2019Dale Flott**, *CB, LSU*. Won the College Football National Championship as a freshman, Flott would miss five weeks with a calf injury and found himself securely on the second string.\n\n*Round 4, Pick #112:* **Daniel Bellinger**, *TE, San Diego State*. Daniel came in to fill the shoes of notorious pass-deflecter Evan Engram and quickly disappointed by catching the ball. Bellinger spent a chunk of the season on IR for an eye injury. Bellinger proved himself as a reliable piece of the offense, and hopefully his new eyeshield will keep him on the field long enough to make a significant impact.\n\n*Round 4, Pick #114:* **Dane Belton**, *S, Iowa.* Named First-Team All-Big 10 Conference as a junior before entering the draft. He broke his collarbone in August but played Week 1 and even got a fumble recovery. Dane would miss four games in the middle of the season due to his clavicle.\n\n*Round 5, Pick #146:* **Micah McFadden**, *LB, Indiana.* Named IU's Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore and team MVP as a junior, McFadden was a solid depth player for the Giants and played about half of all defensive snaps.\n\n*Round 5, Pick #147:* **D.J. Davidson**, *DT, Arizona State.* Played about a third of ST snaps about 10-20% of defensive snaps before he tore his ACL week 5.\n\n*Round 5, Pick #173:* **Marcus McKethan**, *OL, North Carolina.* Tore his ACL in preseason.\n\n*Round 6, Pick #182,* **Darrian Beavers**, *LB, Cincinnati.* Dick Butkus award finalist in college, Darrian tore his ACL in preseason playing his hometown Bengals.\n\n**2022 Free Agency Changes**\n\nAs stated earlier, the cap situation the Giants faced was dire. Cuts had to be made so the rookies could be signed.\n\n**Losses:**\n\nBlake Martinez, Defensive Captain, LB. Recovering from a torn ACL.

Coming off an ACL tear in Week 7, Peppers signed with the Patriots for 2022,\n\n**Key New FAs:**\n\n**Tyrod Taylor, QB, Texas.** Tyrod came in to compete for the starting job. Tyrod did not get the starting job.\n\n**Matt Breida, RB, Buffalo.** Daboll and Schoen certainly leaned on their previous time at Buffalo when looking at potential talent to fill their roster in New York. Breida came in to back up Barkley, and teamed up with Brightwell to fill out the RB room.\n\n**Richie James, WR, San Francisco.** After missing the entire 2021 season with a knee injury, James was eager to come back and show the NFL world what he could do.\n\n**Isaiah Hodgins, WR, Buffalo.** Hodgins was signed from the Bills practice squad mid-season following the loss of Wan\u2019Dale Robinson, and immediately made an impact.\n\n**Ricky Seals-Jones, TE, Washington.** A notable signing within the division, Ricky was signed to provide a veteran presence to the TE room but was put on IR for a toe issue and was released in September from the team. Ricky did not play in the 2022 season.\n\n**Jon Feliciano, C, Buffalo.** Originally a guard at Buffalo, Jon came in to fill the gap left behind by Will Hernandez, a passionate center who sometimes let his drive to protect the quarterback turn into penalty flags.\n\n**Mark Glowinski, G, Colts.** Mark was part of the deadly one-two punch for the Colts, along with All Pro Quinten Nelson, and was expected to do the same with the Giants and Andrew Thomas.\n\n**Jihad Ward, DE, Jacksonville.** A DE from Jacksonville, Ward would be moved to OLB as a versatile component of Wink's scheme.\n\n**Jamie Gillan, P, Buffalo.** The Scottish Hammer, Gillan played for the Browns as an UDFA from 2019-2021, and was signed from Bill's practice squad.\n\nRegular Season\n\n**Week 1: Giants vs Titans.**\n\nThe former #1 seed in the AFC led 13-0 at the half after a Daniel Jones sack-fumble, but the Giants answered with Barkley's 68 yard TD and Shepard's 65 yard TD to tie the game. This game had arguably the emotional turning point for the Giants - after two years of Judge playing not to lose, Daboll called for the dagger and Barkley scored a 2 point conversion, giving the Giants the first lead of the game with a minute left. The Titans's game-winning FG sailed wide left. For the first time in five years, the Giants would win their season opener to go 1-0.\n\n*Giants win, 21-20 (1-0)*\n\n**Week 2: Giants vs Panthers.**\n\nIn the battle of kickers, Graham Gano came out on top. Christian McCaffrey rushed for 102 yards amid a pedestrian QB performance from both teams, but it was a 4\/4 FG performance - two from 50+ - from Gano who made the difference and won the game.\n\n*Giants win, 19-16 (2-0)*\n\n**Week 3: Giants vs Cowboys.**\n\nThe Cooper Rush experiment continued, and the Giants couldn't get out of their own way. Despite playing a tight game, Jones threw his second pick on the year when David Sills slipped and Diggs dove to capitalize.\n\n*Giants lose, 23-16 (2-1)*\n\n**Week 4: Giants vs Bears**.\n\nIt featured not one, but two Daniel Jones rushing TDs before his ankle was injured. Tyrod came in for two drives and ended them both on his own terms - an interception and a concussion. Jones lined up at WR while Saquon took on QB duties in a wildcat and gained enough field position for a Gano field goal. This game was marred by turnovers, but Saquon put up 146 yards on the ground and would not be stopped.\n\n*Giants win, 20-12 (3-1)*\n\n**Week 5: Giants vs Packers.**\n\nThe Giants proved they were a second-half team with yet another 4th quarter comeback. Down 20-13 in the 4th, the Giants would find the endzone twice and take a safety on the final drive to burn the clock down. Rodgers tried for Hail Mary, but gave up a sack fumble to ice the game.\n\n*Giants win, 27-22 (4-1)*\n\n**Week 6: Giants vs Ravens**\n\nThe Ravens couldn't quite put the game away, as Lamar threw a pick to Julian Love that led to the game-winning TD and [Kayvon knocked the ball out of Lamar's hands](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/can-t-miss-play-kayvon-thibodeaux-strip-sacks-lamar-jackson-late-in-4th-quarter-) to force a second turnover in as many drives. It was 20-10 with 12:54 left in the 4th.\n\n*Giants win, 24-20 (5-1)*\n\n**Week 7: Giants vs Jacksonville.**\n\nThis was a bit of a grudge match, as Evan Engram got to face his former team at home. Engram had a stellar showing, Bellinger got a hands-on eye examination, and on a final drive decorated by flags the Giants D managed a stop [inches away from the endzone.](https:\/\/www.nfl.com\/videos\/can-t-miss-play-fabian-moreau-saves-giants-with-tackle-at-1-yard-line-at-buzzer)\n\n*Giants win, 23-17 (6-1)*\n\n**Week 8: Giants vs Seahawks**\n\nLittle known fact: Richie James had the third best catch percentage in the league. Well known fact: Richie James fumbled two different punt returns to give the Seahawks primo field positioning. Not only did Geno Smith end Eli Manning's Iron Man streak of 210 starts in 2017, he continued his own streak of Giant losses.\n\n*Giants lose, 27-13 (6-2)*\n\n**Week 9: Giants vs Giants**.\n\nXavier McKinney, standout safety, shattered the bones in his hand in an ATV accident and would be placed on IR until Week 17.\n\n**Week 10: Giants vs Texans**\n\nIn a rare turn of events, the Giants took the lead and never looked back. Lawrence Cager caught [his lone TD of the year](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/lawrence-cager-caps-opening-drive-with-first-career-td-giants-vs-texans-highligh), Slayton caught a long TD, and Jones only attempted 17 passes as Barkley put the team on his shoulders with 35 carries for 152 yards and TD. The Giants forced two redzone turnovers - one fumble, one pick - and Cager scooped up the Texans' onside kick attempt to ice the game.\n\n*Giants win, 24-16 (7-2)*\n\n**Week 11: Giants vs Lions**\n\nThe wind wreaked havoc this game, sending two of Graham Gano's XP tries [wide](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-NXeGKT03DQ) (his only two misses on the year) and prevented the Giants from getting their passing game going. On the other end, Jamaal Williams saved my fantasy team by finding the endzone three different times. Aidan Hutchinson got a rare Daniel Jones pick.\n\n*Giants lose, 31-18 (7-3)*\n\n**Week 12: Giants vs Cowboys**\n\nSometimes, it's family that ruins your Thanksgiving. Sometimes, it's because the turkey was undercooked and everyone has to share one bathroom. This year, the Cowboys swept the Giants for the second season in a row.\n\n*Giants lose, 28-20 (7-4)*\n\n**Week 13: Giants vs Commanders**\n\nCommanders would own time of possession (41:11 - 28:49) and put up 100 more yards of offense, but could not capitalize. Heinicke was [strip sacked by Ojulari](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/azeez-ojulari-forces-recovers-fumble-off-taylor-heinicke-giants-vs-commanders-hi), which would turn into 7 points on a Hodgins TD. Gano would miss a 58 yarder at the end of overtime to seal the tie.\n\n*Giants tie, 20-20 (7-4-1)*\n\n**Week 14: Giants vs Eagles**.\n\nA dominant Eagles team capitalized on numerous Giant mistakes, including a rare punting penalty.\n\n*Giants lose, 48-22 (7-5-1)*\n\n**Week 15: Giants vs Commanders.** This game was a must-win game for both teams, as it would ultimately decide who would be the third team from NFCE to make the playoffs. Kayvon had an absolutely monster game, getting a strip sack TD in the 2nd quarter, making a goal line stop in the 4th quarter against a rushing Heinecke, and making 3 TFL throughout the contest. However, this game would be marred by a controversial illegal formation call on Terry McLaurin and a [controversial non-DPI call](https:\/\/www.nfl.com\/news\/nfl-informed-commanders-that-officials-should-have-called-dpi-on-final-play-in) in the endzone on the final play. The Giants would win their first in five weeks, and now only need one more win to clinch the playoffs.\n\n*Giants win, 20-12 (8-5-1)*\n\n**Week 16: Giants vs Vikings** This game would come down to which team could get the most stops on defense. The Giants led in yardage - total yards, passing yards, rushing yards, yards per play - but only converted 3\/11 third downs, had two turnovers, and had an unbelievable 7 penalties for 63 yards. This was an absolutely winnable game that the Giants simply could not get out of their own way. Fun stat - kickers were 4\/12 for 60+ yard game winning field goals over the last five years, and 2\/2 against the Giants. Greg Joseph lined up for his 61 yarder, and [extended the streak to 3\/3](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AoXbza-gA_Q).\n\n*Giants lose, 27-24 (8-6-1)*\n\n**Week 17: Giants vs Colts.** The defense came in hot, with former All Pro Landin Collins scoring his [first pick six](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q-JivX12qZ4) in years. Kayvon got a sack, and celebrated with an uncomfortably long snow angel. This would be Xavier McKinney's first game back from injury and it showed - he tried to intercept a pass with his hand in a protective club. Luckily, it wouldn't matter too much - the Colts offensive line was porous and our defense took advantage.\n\n*Giants win, 38-10 (9-6-1)*\n\n**Week 18: Littles vs Eagles**. Giants rested their starters in this meaningless match-up, but the Eagles\u2019 conservative game-plan didn\u2019t take hold and they were forced to keep their starters in for the entire game to clinch the #1 seed in the NFC. Davis Webb started and played in his first NFL game, and he did the impossible - throw a touchdown to Kenny Golladay. The Giants lost the match-up 22-16, but seeing the Eagles struggle in Hurts\u2019 first game back made the Eagles look vulnerable for the first time all season. Surely this was a sign of things to come?\n\n*Giants lose, 22-16 (9-7-1)*\n\n**Wild Card: Giants vs Vikings.** In an absolute barnburner of a match, this repeat of Week 16 became a battle of possession as both teams kept finding the endzone. The Giants offense was firing on full cylinders, featuring Daniel Jones channeling his inner [Derrick Henry](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/10cwjv9\/highlight_daniel_jones_stiffarms_patrick_peterson\/) on a stiff-arm against Patrick Peterson in the first quarter and an unbelievable catch by Isaiah Hodgins on second down in the fourth to extend the drive. The Giants defense held and sent Big Blue to the Divisional Round.\n\n*Giants win, 31-24*\n\n**Divisional Round: Giants vs Eagles**. Remember what I said two weeks ago? Yeah, I was wrong. Not a lot to talk about - Giants had no rhythm behind them and the defense was helpless against a healthy Eagles team.\n\n*Giants lose, 38-7*\n\n**Overall: 9-7-1, 1-4-1 Division**\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* [Going for two against the Titans](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/saquon-barkley-brings-in-the-two-point-conversion-giants-vs-titans-highlights)\n* [Strip sack against Lamar to ice the game](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVkaY8QLZYo)\n* [Kayvon strip sack TD](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dhioAVDGtAk)\n* [Landin Collins Pick-6](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q-JivX12qZ4)\n* [Kenny Golladay with the TD](https:\/\/www.giants.com\/video\/kenny-golladay-makes-insane-one-handed-touchdown-catch-giants-vs-eagles-highligh)\n* [Giants win their first playoff game in a decade](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NFL\/status\/1614786354071900161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1614786354071900161%7Ctwgr%5E3da17a527a8fb642fdbca9973b435c3b403d0ea9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnesn.com%2F2023%2F01%2Fwhat-was-kirk-cousins-thinking-on-vikings-fourth-down-play%2F)\n\n**Lowlights:**\n\n* Richie James fumbles vs Seattle\n* Aidan Hutchinson INT\n* Adoree Jackson injury\n* [Kayvon's Snow Angel memes](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/NFCEastMemeWar\/comments\/1043d1q\/thibs_if_he_had_a_time_machine\/)\n* The entirety of the Divisional Round\n\nStats\n\n**Offense**\n\n|Stat|2021|2022|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Passing Yards|3196 (31st in NFL)|3157 (26th in NFL)|\n|Rushing Yards|1688 (24th in NFL)|2519 (4th in NFL)|\n|Total YPG|287.29 (31st in NFL)|333.88 (18th in NFL)|\n|Passing TDs|15 (30th in NFL)|17 (24th in NFL)|\n|Rushing TDs|8 (31st in NFL)|21 (4th in NFL)|\n|Points Scored|258 (31st in NFL)|365 (15th in NFL)|\n|Red Zone Efficiency|44.7% (32nd in NFL)|63.3% (7th in NFL)|\n|Turnovers|32 (32nd in NFL)|16 (2nd in NFL)|\n\n**Defense**\n\n|Stat|2021|2022|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Passing Yards Allowed|3839 (15th in NFL)|3638 (14th in NFL)|\n|Rushing Yards Allowed|2193 (25th in NFL)|2451 (27th in NFL|\n|Total YPG|354.82 (21st in NFL)|358.18 (25th in NFL)|\n|Points Allowed|416 (23rd in NFL)|371 (17th in NFL)|\n|Red Zone Efficiency|52.1% (9th in NFL)|49.2% (5th in NFL)|\n|Turnovers|22 (14th in NFL)|19 (25th in NFL)|\n\n**Roster Review:**\n\n**All Pro:** Andrew Thomas, LT. Dexter Lawrence, NT.\n\n**Pro Bowl:** Saquon Barkley, RB. Dexter Lawrence, NT. Alternates: Graham Gano, K. Andrew Thomas, LT. Jon Feliciano, C. Kayvon Thibodeaux, DE.\n\n**Team Strengths:** QB(?), RB, DL, K.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of this write-up after a decade of losing is acknowledging that there are parts of this team that are performing far and beyond expectations. With Daniel Jones making better decisions with the ball, Andrew Thomas faithfully defending his QB's blind side, Dexter Lawrence devouring All Pro centers, Kayvon Thibodeaux putting pressure on the QB, and Graham Gano hitting over 90% of his FG attempts there are some pillars to build the rest of the team around.\n\n**Team Needs:** WR, OL, LB, CB.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still plenty of positions in dire need of upgrade. Our WRs were either injured or practice squad signees. Our OL depth was injured and only Andrew Thomas could reliably protect this QB. Our linebackers were porous - either Jaylon Smith was tackling runners five yards too late or Kayvon had to turn around and tackle someone. And it's no coincidence that once both McKinney and Adoree Jackson were out with injuries, the Giants went from 7-2 all the way to 8-6-1. Our depth is lacking, but a number of starters need to be replaced before the Giants go from squeaking into the playoffs to being a contender with the Eagles and Cowboys.\n\nLooking Into 2023\n\n**2023 Draft Picks:**\n\nWith comp picks from Toney, Engram, and others, the Giants have:\n\nRound 1, #25\n\nRound 2, #57\n\nRound 3, #89\n\nRound 3, #100\n\nRound 4, #128\n\nRound 5, #160\n\nRound 5, #172\n\nRound 6, #209\n\nRound 7, #240\n\nRound 7, #243\n\nRound 7, #254\n\n**Key Contracts:**\n\n**Daniel Jones, QB**. Daniel Jones was not given a fifth year option, and now the Giants will either have to shell out, use the franchise tag, or let him walk. Jones was able to limit his turnovers this year to throw just 5 interceptions in 17 games, leading the league in INT percentage (1.1%). Jones pushed the offensive to be the 5th most efficient team in the red zone in the NFL (64.81%). He turned his habits of staring down receivers and taking the first read to throwing [no look passes](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/10en15v\/highlight_daniel_patrick_mahomes_jones_drops_the\/) under pressure and learning to throw the ball away to prevent sacks. Daniel\u2019s still trucking defenders for extra yards and [touchdowns](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/100semh\/highlight_daniel_jones_drops_the_shoulder_finding\/), but if he learns how to slide he\u2019ll be a threat for years to come.\n\nJones signed a 4 year, $160 million deal on March 7th. His cap hit for 2023 is $19 million.\n\n**Saquon Barkley, RB.** Saquon may not be quite as fast or explosive as he was back in 2018, but the man is still as close as a player can get to a Dothraki in an open field. He put up 931 rushing yards in the first 9 games, after all, and finished top 5 in rushing yards. Saquon led the Giants in targets (76) and receptions (57). Barkley also was PFF's #1 pass-blocking RB of the year.\n\nThat being said, Barkley was phased out in the second half of the season. Barkley only put up 381 yards in the last 8 games, and was only given 9 carries in each of the two playoff games. Barkley is used as a receiving back, but led the position in passes dropped. Saquon was tagged with the non-exclusive franchise tag for $10.1 million.\n\n**Sterling Shepard, WR**. Sterling Shepard hasn't played a full season since 2018, and has reached the void year of his contract.\n\nHe played just 3 games in 2022, 7 games in 2021, 12 games in 2020, 10 games in 2019, and all 16 games in 2018.\n\n**Darius Slayton, WR.** Drafted the same year as Daniel Jones, Slayton rode the depth chart like a roller coaster over the last year. Injuries and trades forced Slayton back into the lead wideout role where he had drops in clutch moments. He took a paycut to stay with the Giants so his heart is in the right place, but he needs his hands to catch up.\n\n**Julian Love, FS.** Love was a key player on defense who took over playcalling when McKinney was out. Far from the flashiest player, Love quietly came in Top 3 for tackles, solo tackles, and interceptions. Love is a potential cap casualty if the Giants aren't willing to shell out to keep him.\n\n**Other FAs of Note:**\n\nMatt Breida, RB. Nick Gates, G. Jon Feliciano, C. Jihad Ward, DE. Jamie Gillan, P. Richie James, WR. Fabian Moreau, CB. Oshane Ximines, OLB.\n\n**Staff:**\n\n**Joe Schoen, GM:** Now that the preseason has begun, the hard decisions are being made. Golladay is gone and Schoen says the Giants will \"take their medicine\" and eat his entire cap hit in 2023 instead of spreading it out. Jones has been signed, Barkley was tagged, some key depth pieces have been signed but Schoen has pointed out that he's not looking to sign players for the veteran minimum this season (like 6\/8 signings last year were). Now that the Giants have some cash, it's safe to expect a new player or two.\n\n**Brian Daboll, HC:** The 2022 Coach of the Year, Brian Daboll took a team made in a box of scraps and brought them not only to the playoffs, but helped them achieve their first playoff win since 2011. His gutsy two-point conversion call in Week 1 established that the Giants are a threat to be reckoned with and set the tone for the season. His playbook was able to utilize Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley as a true dual-threat, and make the most out of practice squad caliber receivers.\n\n**Mike Kafka, OC:** For his first year calling plays, Mike had no problem settling into rhythms, allowing drives to develop, and utilized his weapons as needed to prolong drives. One of the most notable ideas Kafka added to the offense was having routes develop past the sticks on 3rd down - something the Giants offense hadn\u2019t seen in years.\n\n**Wink Martindale, DC:** Wink stayed true to his blitz-heavy history out of necessity due to injury and lack of talent. The Giants had a fantastic red zone defense - among top 5 in the NFL - but struggled to generate turnovers or stop the run. Wink is likely pushing behind the scenes for some linebackers in free agency.\n\n**Thomas McGaughey, STC**: Thomas has been the Special Teams Coordinator for the Giants for the last five years, and has overseen a fantastic field goal unit and solid coverage from the punting team. Graham Gano has been a reliable placekicker, ranking consistently in the Top 10, but Jamie Gillan has left a lot to be desired with his inconsistent punting.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis season highlighted for many the importance a good coach can make. No one expected this Giants team to win more than 6 or 7 games, let alone clinch the playoffs in Week 17 and win their first Wild Card in a decade. The question becomes, of course, how do we move forward from here? With a number of difficult decisions to be made for cap space and a large number of weaknesses to shore up, the 2023 Giants are going to be a very different team.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678550254.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Jason Taylor Scoops Up The Fumble and Ties Record for Touchdowns","author":"xxqj","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/SDQFUuRzV3c","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678573393.0},{"title":"[Yates] Bills DT Tim Settle agreed to a renegotiated deal for 2023 that reduces his cap charge by about $600K.

Tom Brady isn\u2019t returning.\n\nBut poke your head just a little below the surface, and this endearing little quip begins to seem quite mysterious. Suddenly, Nicolas Cage snatches up the tweet and shows you there is in fact a 200 year old map revealed when you hold this tweet up to sunlight.\n\nFirst of all, this tweet actually makes no sense\u2014even on the surface. A quick google search reveals that as recently as 2017 the Brady household was the home of at lest 4 dogs (2 pitbull mixes, a terrier, and a beagle, if you wanted to know). Not only is Brady the image of the ceaseless dynamo, his effort falling short of no task, but he has ample history as a pet owner and would not succumb to the burden of a 2 month old kitten.\n\nOk, so what could the tweet mean? We know Tom Brady was not defeated by a 2 month old kitten. It is interesting, though, to see Tom is referencing cats where before he had dogs. Perhaps this is meant to be a different sort of message. Football is tough, physical, demanding\u2014an existential task to be a man who can withstand slings and arrows. Small, clumsy adopted kittens, however, are another side of life entirely. They need the protection of home, and they bring smiles to daughters faces. Is Tom meaning to signal to us that he has finally glimpsed the other dimension of life, the one where there is rest, being, and peace? the contentedness of the heart as it is expressed in the peace of a kitten? \n\nFurthermore, Tom has always been an effective step ahead of Aaron Rodgers in all crucial regards for as long as they have been compared. While Rodgers has been soaking up attention in long podcasts, Tom writes pithy symbolic tweets which show the expansion of his soul. While Rodgers lives in darkness, Tom shows us how he now lives in light. Perhaps he wants to show us how much better he does even at finding inner peace than Rodgers.\n\nTom mentions not just a kitten, but also his daughter. Is this a double movement, the movement toward his family he could never bring himself to make, but which is now bridged and clinched through the transcendent doorway of a young adopted kitten? Did the scar of a bitter divorce finally open Brady to look at life anew, and find in the moment of providing a kitten for his daughter a truth he had never seen before? A presence he could finally be, that he could not be before?\n\nWhile it could be a veiled koan about this transition of life and being, something about it strikes the wrong note. The timing, the good-guyism of it, the perfect lightness of its jokiness\u2014it still doesn\u2019t quite settle one\u2019s suspicions. Something about it being a *2 month* old kitten. It feels like when someone is overly specific in their desperation to convince you of something. Like if a person asks you for 57 cents. Okay, why 57? What\u2019s so vital about the 57 that it\u2019s going to be exactly what does the job. Same with this kitten. Oh, you\u2019re quitting the NFL for good because it\u2019s a *2* month old kitten. Riiight.\n\nAnd so the kitten tweet has not allayed the football world\u2019s suspicions about Brady\u2019s intentions. Whether it be a moment of transcendence of self and a life awakening, or a fatuous and flimsy ploy to throw us off his scent\u2014the 7 time Super Bowl winning greatest QB of all time offers us a soft little dopey furball as the ultimate obstacle between him and the game he gave his life for.","upvote_ratio":0.41,"created_utc":1678683823.0},{"title":"Even though he is retired, Tom Brady's largest single season cap hit will be 2023","author":"Wallydinger123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11oakf4\/even_though_he_is_retired_tom_bradys_largest\/","text":"Thanks to void years.\n\nThis is true both in dollar value and in percentage of the cap. https:\/\/overthecap.com\/player\/tom-brady\/1250","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678508608.0},{"title":"[Spielberger] D.J.

But you can\u2019t have 0.2 of a person, thus it doesn\u2019t make sense to have such a percentile represented as you can\u2019t translate it to actual, practical or applicable terms. \n\n \\* **The A Grade range** was figured out in a previous breakdown & corresponds to the range that correlates to Pro Bowl \/ All-Pro level performance in a given year. \n\n \\* To improve the quality of all the data, minimum participation requirements had to be met. For example, Linemen had to contribute at least 40 Snaps\/Game so that the truly best players were being identified \u2013 managing to perform in the Top 10 or Top 20 despite playing hundreds more snaps than another player is a much stronger accomplishment. \n\n* Sample size is an important thing to consider in any analysis.   \nEvery position was held to a Starter level minimum standard. \n\n \\* All ages were determined by calculating what age that player would\u2019ve been at the start of each season (in September). This prevents error from, for example, counting a player as being 25 years old but their birthday was in Week 1 (and so, realistically, was 26 years old when they were performing in football). This puts everyone on the same page, in-turn leveling the playing field & improving the quality of the data. \n\n========================\n\n**\u25ba\u25ba  REFLECTING ON THE DATA:  \u25c4\u25c4**\n\nWow. To say that **RUNNING BACK** is a young man\u2019s game is an understatement. A whopping 90% of RBs in the Top 10 are going to be 26.1 years old or younger. That means that, historically, among the Top 10 RBs by Grade only ONE (1) will be older than 26.1 years old in a given season. And if we look at the 80th Percentile for RBs, we see that in the Top 10 only *TWO* (2) would be older than 25.2 years old, historically.  \n\nConsidering that most NFL players are drafted between the ages of 21-23, and the fact that Rookie NFL contracts are 3\u20135 years long, then at **minimum** a RB taken in the 1st Rd (5-year contract) won\u2019t see their first, actual \u201cbig money\u201d contract until.. they\u2019re already at the **end** of their prime!\n\nOn the complete opposite end of the table, we have the **QUARTERBACKS**. We can see that among the Top 10 Graded QBs, historically 90% of them had all the way until turning 39.2 years old to be a real contender for the Top 10 at your position. \n\n* Even if you extend it to just the Top 20 QBs, 90% of them historically have been 37 years old or younger! We also see that 90% of Quarterbacks that performed at a Pro Bowl or All-Pro level (*aka: at the \u201cA Grade\u201d range*) all had until the age of 36.7 years old to do so! \n* The fact we are seeing so many older players represented in the Top 10 (and Top 20), in-turn dragging the percentiles up, is indicative of just how much longer QB primes are. \n* The career earning potential for a Quarterback is enormous in comparison to what a Running Back is likely to make in today\u2019s NFL.\n\n**WIDE RECEIVER** turns out to be another relatively young man\u2019s game \u2013 though not nearly to the extent of Running Backs. \n\n* Among Top 10 WRs by Grade, receivers have historically had until 29.2 years old to dominate the NFL and rank among the 10 best. \n* Even loosening the percentiles slightly reveals that in a given year, historically only **2** receivers in the Top 10 will be 28 years or older (as 80% would be younger). \n* A receiver\u2019s age 30 year has historically been the last year he has a realistic shot at cracking even the Top 20, as the 90th percentile reveals only 2 out of the Top 20 in a given year will be 30 years old or older.

(20-27 loss in divisional round to Kansas City Chiefs after 31-30 victory over Los Angeles Chargers)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWelcome to the 2022 Jacksonville Jaguars, where your decades of...well, mostly suffering will be rewarded with a season that gives you so much hope that you aren't sure what to do with your hands.\n\nSeriously, do y'all know what it feels like to write this with big grins on our faces just one year after Urban Meyer, whose brief tenure is referred to with terminology generally saved for the likes of Voldemort or national disasters? The feelings toward Doug Pederson couldn't be any different \u2014 to the point where Jags Safety Andrew Wingard [saying he'd die for Doug](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wAn00spaNqY) didn't feel all that hyperbolic.\n\nSo with near-Ted Lasso levels of joyful optimism, here is your recap of the 2022 PLAYOFF-GAME WINNING Jacksonville Jaguars from \/u\/el_pobbster, \/u\/JohnnySnark, \/u\/InexorableWaffle, and me.\n\n**2022 Offseason \u2014 Free Agency** (by \/u\/el_pobbster)\n\nThis offseason for the Jaguars was marked by a fairly sizable spending spree, which certainly raised some eyebrows around the league \u2013and even elicited a certain amount of mockery. While the price tags on some of these were looked at with derision, the results can\u2019t be too easily dismissed. It was an integral part of the spectacular turnaround in Pederson\u2019s first year.\n\n* *Foley Fatukasi (3 years, 30M, 20M guaranteed):* The Jaguars needed to shore up the middle of their defensive line. To that effect, the Jaguars bring in the top run defending DT in free agency on a relatively affordable deal. He was very stout as a run stopper for the New York Jets, with some upside in collapsing the pocket. While he did show up, he still had several missed tackles and struggled to anchor in the middle. He\u2019ll need to clean up these issues if the Jaguars are to get their money.\n* *Foye Oluokun (3 years, 45M, 28M guaranteed):* This was a huge area of need going into the offseason. Myles Jack had been in more or less constant decline since his rookie year in that vaunted 2017 Sacksonville defense and was let go. Trent Baalke was aggressive in pursuing the former Atlanta linebacker, giving him a rich deal. He certainly panned out, leading not only the team, but the entire league in tackles. He was a clean-up artist at the second level, and was also a leading brain on the field, helping break in fellow rookies Muma and Lloyd. One of the bigger wins in free agency for Baalke.\n* *Christian Kirk (4 years, 72M, 37M guaranteed):* This was **the** move that had people asking questions. It felt like a substantial overpay for an undersized slot-first receiver who had never reached the 1000-yard benchmark in his stay in the Kingsbury-led Cardinals offense. It might have proved to be one of the smartest and most influential move. Kirk lead the Jaguars in receptions, targets, touchdowns and yards, getting over 1100 yards, 84 receptions and 8 touchdowns. He showed a lot of chemistry with Lawrence as a reliable target, doing a great job of consistently getting open and making plays. For all the criticism this signing garnered, it might be proving to be one of the shrewdest.\n* *Evan Engram (1 year, 10M, 9M guaranteed):* Throughout Pederson\u2019s time in Philadelphia, he showed he loved the TE position. Engram had under-performed with the Giants since his rookie year, and had clearly worn out his welcome in the Big Apple. He was featured in Pederson\u2019s offense, and got a real chance to shine, and \\*boy oh boy\\* did he take it. He was incredibly useful as a side-to-side stretcher of the offense, making plays underneath and down the seam, acting as an athletic weapon on screen plays and being overall one of the best TEs in Jacksonville history. Look to him as one of the priority re-signings for Baalke.\n\n[Read the rest of el\\_pobbster's free agency writeup.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11nsuyo\/comment\/jborey0\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**2022 Offseason \u2014 Draft Picks** (by \/u\/el_pobbster)\n\nAfter selecting Trevor Lawrence #1 overall of the 2021 NFL draft, the Jaguars were once again slotted to pick first overall in the 2022 NFL draft, joining a fairly infamous club of teams who received back-to-back #1 overall picks in the Super Bowl era, alongside the 1976-77 Buccaneers, the 1994-95 Bengals, the 1999-2000 Browns and the 2017-2018 Browns. This batch of draft picks was generally much maligned in post-draft analysis, and while it is still far too early to judge as to whether or not this was a good draft class, it is clear that many of these rookies are going to need to step their game up in year 2 if the Jaguars are to compete for the highest honors this year and moving forward.\n\n* **Round 1, pick 1 \u2014** *Travon Walker, Edge, Georgia:* Possibly one of, if not the most controversial pick Trent Baalke made in that draft class. Throughout most of the pre-draft process, the best available prospect was largely seen to be Aiden Hutchinson, with talk of the Jaguars also flirting with some of the high-end OT talent in the draft class. However, the Jaguars\u2019 front office decided to go with the incredibly high ceiling offered by the pretty much unprecedented athleticism of the former Bulldog. While he had extremely limited pass-rushing production at Georgia, this was partly due to the defensive scheme and how little he was asked to do it. This was a gamble taken on the incredibly complete athletic profile, which showed an almost unparalleled combination of length, strength, agility, and change of direction. While he wasn\u2019t particularly productive as a rusher this season, he did show signs of improvement over the back end of the season. This was always more of a project pick, so seeing signs of development this early is always good news.\n* **Round 1, pick 27 \u2014** *Devin Lloyd, LB, Utah:* With the cutting of Myles Jack, the linebacker position was a major need for the Jaguars. Baalke moved up aggressively back into round 1 to pick what was seen by many as the best all-arounder in the draft class. He started the season very strong, making several impact plays, including a key (and to this redditor, very memorable) interception against the Chargers in week 3. He did fade hard over the back end of the season, even losing his starter status to fellow rookie Chad Muma. He looked quite lost at time, being bossed around and set-up pre-snap by Oluokun. He also struggled quite mightily in coverage over the latter part of the year. Linebacker is a position where rookies do traditionally struggle, but him being seen as a pro-ready prospect who is on the older side does make it a bit of a concern.\n\n[Read the rest of el\\_pobbster's draft writeup.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11nsuyo\/comment\/jbors7b\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Season review (week by week)** (by \/u\/GeckoRoamin)\n\nLet's start by going through the season with a rapid-fire assessment...\n\n|Week|Result|Score|General Feeling|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|L|JAX 22 @ WSH 27|Bad.|\n|2|W|JAX 24 vs. IND 0|Good.|\n|3|W|JAX 38 @ LAC 10|GOOD.|\n|4|L|JAX 21 @ PHI 29|Not great.|\n|5|L|JAX 6 vs. HOU 13|REAL BAD.|\n|6|L|JAX 27 @ IND 34|REAL BAD.|\n|7|L|JAX 17 vs. NYG 23|BAD.|\n|8|L|JAX 17 vs. DEN 21|REALLY REALLY BAD.|\n|9|W|JAX 27 vs. LV 20|Ok!|\n|10|L|JAX 17 @ KC 27|Bad with a sense of resignation.|\n|11|W|JAX 28 vs. BAL 27|Pretty good, holy crap.|\n|12|L|JAX 14 @ DET 40|Bad again.|\n|13|W|JAX 36 @ TEN 22|REAL GOOD.|\n|14|W|JAX 40 vs. DAL 34|REALLY REALLY GOOD.|\n|15|W|JAX 19 @ NYJ 3|STILL GOOD.|\n|16|W|JAX 31 @ HOU 3|SO GOOD.|\n|17|W|JAX 20 vs. TEN 16|ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.|\n|Playoffs - WC|W|JAX 31 vs. LAC 30|VERY BAD THEN VERY VERY VERY GOOD, SLIGHTLY DEAD|\n|Playoffs - DIV|L|JAX 20 vs. KC|Sad, but optimistic for the future.

Tasked with the job of vanquishing the complete bootay stank that was of the Urban Meyer experience, he has his work cut out for him. Surprisingly, the underappreciated Super Bowl winning coach had a plan and vision for this team. The pairing of [two scoops Doug](https:\/\/youtu.be\/rGptiVEm8L4) with Trevor may be the exact thing the AFC South loathes for the next decade or so.\n* **September 18, 2022:** The jaguars blow out the Colts 24-0 with another win against Jim Irsay's ego in Jacksonville. While the [hiring of Jeff Saturday](https:\/\/youtu.be\/gK4JWGuhAsE) wasn't directly after this loss, the continued haunting of Irsay by the Jags *may* have sparked that eventual move.\n* **November 27, 2022:** Trevor Lawrence produces another comeback in which the [Jaguars stun the Ravens](https:\/\/youtu.be\/hCfjYzVR6EA?t=131) 28-27 in Jacksonville. This was a thrilling 4th quarter that surprised us all in the stadium and exercised some demons that haunted the team during their five game losing streak.\n* **December 11, 2022:** [Travon Walker](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zdA_tY1qBIU) and [Shaq Quarterman](https:\/\/youtu.be\/0Q5wIviAQJQ) come up big in the first half, causing turnovers in a 36-22 takedown of the Titans. This was the first time the Jaguars had won at Nashville since November 10, 2013.\n* **December 18, 2022:** With a little more than seven minutes left in overtime against the Cowboys, Rayshawn Jenkins snags a deflected pass by Noah Brown and totes it 52 yards with a [walk-off pick six](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ISXXBZ09ORM?t=653)to win 40-34. The stunned Yankee fans in attendance were surprised to hear that the touchdown did in fact end the game for their beloved Cowboys. This was also Jenkins' first career pick six.\n* **January 14, 2023:** [Riley Patterson squeaks in a 36-yard field goal](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bnLHXkQ4Gwo) with time expiring as the Jaguars complete their 27-point comeback versus the Chargers to win 31-30. Probably the best game I've been to in person, and I was there for both the Ravens and Cowboys games earlier in the year. Unbelievable comeback.\n* **March 6, 2023** (addition by \/u\/GeckoRoamin): Calvin Ridley is [officially reinstated by the NFL](https:\/\/www.nfl.com\/news\/jaguars-wr-calvin-ridley-fully-reinstated-following-suspension-for-violating-nfl) after being suspended in March 2022 for violating the league's gambling policy.

Since then, he has been nothing but competent and even great at times. The 2022 Baalke master class started with him outmaneuvering the league for the exceptional talents of Christian Kirk and criminally underrated linebacker Foye Oluokun. It has continued with his savvy, low-risk move of trading for Calvin Ridley before the 2022 trade deadline to provide Trevor with more offensive weapons in the future. Baalke himself spent 12 seasons with the 49ers but had a much maligned departure, in which criticism has followed him to Jacksonville. Hopefully the partnership with Doug Pederson continues to bring success to the front office and on field performance in the future. With the emergence of Trevor Lawrence, Baalke has a solid foundation as a GM; he will be given the opportunity to keep rehabilitating his image as long as the Jaguars' front office continues to field playoff-winning teams.\n* *Doug Pederson* \u2014 *Head Coach:* After much trepidation on the Jaguars coaching search in early 2022, we luckily landed with Doug Pederson. Unsurprisingly, a former Super Bowl winning coach knows how to put together an NFL staff and provide a [winning vision](https:\/\/youtu.be\/WXhGzEtScUM) to his players. He spoke several times early in the off season of how there was a need for the players to have healing after the Urban Meyer tenure and a lack of trust that was needing to be rebuilt from the ground up. To say that Doug's presence in the locker room and on the field is a relief is an understatement; he truly has turned this team and organization around. He's instilled a mentality of [\"So what, now what?\"](https:\/\/youtu.be\/426nu3wlNAs?t=138) which you can attribute to the team's resiliency this year and being able to define their 2022 season with several comeback wins. Doug played 12 years in the NFL as a quarterback, and that experience has clearly helped Trevor grow this year. He's an Andy Reid coaching tree disciple who has spent over 30 years under Reid as both a player and coach. There may be plenty of meetings between the two in the playoffs going forward if Doug can keep building upon this winning foundation.\n\n[Read the rest of JohnnySnark's coaching staff review.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11nsuyo\/comment\/jbosqxn\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Upcoming free agents from your team** (by \/u\/InexorableWaffle)\n\n* Evan Engram, TE *(Franchise Tagged)*\n* Jawaan Taylor, RT\n* Marvin Jones, WR\n* Arden Key, EDGE\n* Dawuane Smoot, EDGE\n* Andrew Wingard, S\n\nAs can be expected of a team that had multiple consecutive losing seasons prior to this past season who also went on a major FA spending spree last offseason, the Jags don\u2019t have that many critical FAs to re-sign. Even so, we have a select few that deserve specific mention.\n\nFirst and foremost, we have Evan Engram and Jawaan Taylor. They\u2019re easily the standouts of the list above, and since there\u2019s a good chance that what happens to one will affect our plans regarding the other, I\u2019m going to cover them in the same section. Long story short, they both are among the premier players that will be available at their respective positions, and we likely don\u2019t have the cap to re-sign both (especially with the better Josh Allen being in line for a potential extension in the near future). Given the contract we signed Cam Robinson to and the presence of Walker Little (who\u2019s looked solid in limited starts, for the most part), my thoughts were that we would prioritize Engram over Taylor, and seeing as the latter was given the franchise tag, that seems to be the case. With Engram now guaranteed to be on the roster, I can say with confidence that I'll be rather surprised if Jawaan Taylor is on our opening day roster. However, there's still a lot of time between now and the official start of FA, so there is time for that to change.\n\nMarvin Jones almost certainly is all but gone. The acquisitions of Christian Kirk, Zay Jones, and Calvin Ridley in the past year have made his presence largely redundant (especially the latter two, considering they figure to be our outside receivers \u2013 Jones\u2019 position \u2013 in 3+ WR sets). His snaps already plummeted this year, and Ridley has yet to take the field. If he\u2019s willing to come back for super cheap, then I suppose it\u2019s possible he returns, but if we\u2019re being realistic, that isn\u2019t happening.\n\nNext up is the pair of rotational edge rushers, Key and Smoot. Our 2nd and 3rd most effective pass-rushers this past season by nearly any metric, I imagine the front office will do everything in its power to retain both of them. The one wrench in the works there, however, is Smoot\u2019s devastating Achilles tear that he suffered late in the season. He almost certainly won\u2019t be ready to go in the early parts of 2023, and even if he is, it\u2019s likely that he won\u2019t be as effective as he usually is until 2024. That being the case, the front office may decide it\u2019s better to look in a different direction, with the focus being on making next year\u2019s team as competitive as possible.\n\nLast on the list is Andrew Wingard. Normally, it\u2019d be weird to list a backup safety in the short-form write=up for this section, but Wingard...almost feels like one of the tone setters for our locker room even though he hardly plays (barring injury)? It\u2019s hard to put into words, and it likely wouldn\u2019t make sense to non-Jags fans even if I managed to do so, so I\u2019ll skip over any sentimentality and say that I imagine he likely gets a larger-than-average contract for a backup safety to stay on the team.\n\n**Team needs** (by \/u\/InexorableWaffle)\n\n* Critical Needs to Address: Slot CB, Interior D-Line\n* High-Priority Needs: OG, Edge Rusher\n* Moderate Needs: TE\\*, OT\\*, backup RB, Outside CB\n* Potential Sunk Cost Need: Off-ball LB\n* Lowest-Priority Needs: K, S, C, WR\n* Luxuries and\/or Not Needed \u2013 QB, P, starting RB\n\n\\*Asterisks denote positions subject to change based on re-signings.\n\n[Read InexorableWaffle's writeup of team needs.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11nsuyo\/comment\/jbottqk\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Why root for the Jacksonville Jaguars** (by \/u\/GeckoRoamin)\n\nThis is a question most Jags fans have asked themselves, and for most of their time as a fan \u2014 so long as that time as been >1 year \u2014 the answer may have been \"because I like to suffer.\" And we can't guarantee there won't be more suffering in the future. But truth be told, the suffering has built a lot of character. Jags fans are weird. Jacksonville is weird. (Jason Mendoza from *The Good Place* was more accurate than folks who haven't been here realize.) And most of us wouldn't have it any other way. It's really painful sometimes to love this team, but it makes the victories \u2014 even some of the moral ones \u2014 especially sweet.\n\nSo why root for the Jags?

In a few days we'll see how my predictions pan out. Side note, the plus symbol indicates a QB competition, my predicted week one winner is listed first.\n\nRaiders: Jimmy Garoppolo\n\nCurrently, the Raiders' only quarterback under contract coming into 2023 is UDFA Chase Garbers, so one way or another they're bringing in new blood. This one fits pretty well imo, the Raiders are looking to be good right now versus spending years building up a rookie, and media rumors suggest Rodgers isn't an option. That leaves them with Garoppolo. It works even better because McDaniels is their HC, and since Garoppolo's likely not a long term option, it'll allow the Raiders to have Stidham waiting in the wings. I predicted they sign Garoppolo to a $50M\/2YR contract.\n\nBuccaneers:  Sam Darnold + Anthony Richardson \n\nLike the Raiders ahead of them, the Bucs are also in a pretty bad QB situation, with Kyle Trask being their only QB under contract in 2023, and he's clearly not the answer. Darnold had a surprisingly solid season with the Panthers, enough to earn him a bridge role on a good team this season, and enough to say that he's arguably the second best free agent quarterback as of now, (unless Brady un-retires again). The Bucs don't have a high enough pick to take Young, Stroud, or Levis, so I think they're getting Richardson. He's clearly not ready for the league as of yet, so I think Darnold will get the start for all of 2023, on a $10M\/1YR deal, and then the keys will be handed over to Richardson in 2024. \n\nJets: Aaron Rodgers \n\nCurrently the Jets have Mike White and Zach Wilson going into 2023, I thought White earned the QB1 job this season, but most others seem to disagree, so my predictions will reflect that. There's a lot of rumors about Rodgers leaving the Packers this season, and I think for once they'll pan out. I'm guessing the Jets get him for a 2023 3rd and a 2024 2nd. It also works pretty well since it'll allow Wilson to have time to develop behind Rodgers.\n\nColts: Andy Dalton + Will Levis\n\nAnd out goes another one year flop, that being Matt Ryan. This time, I think the Colts are taking a blue chip rookie, given their high draft pick and that they have a new coach. However, I'm not sure Levis is gonna be ready week one, so I think they'll start out with Andy Dalton, who had a solid season with the Saints last year. I'm guessing they'll do it sort of how the Bears did it in 2021. I do think Levis has a lot of potential though, and I'm guessing they sign Dalton to a $7.5M\/1YR deal. \n\nPanthers: CJ Stroud + Carson Wentz\n\nFor some reason, the Panthers traded four high value picks and their best receiver to get a slightly better quarterback in the draft, I'll never understand why, but its what they did I guess. I think Bryce Young is the better pick, but their offense seems like a better fit for Stroud, and lately a lot of the mocks have Stroud at number one, so I'll go with him. I think they'll bring in a veteran backup too though, Wentz would make sense since he played for Frank Reich with the Colts. \n\nTexans: Bryce Young + Taylor Heinicke \n\nAs a Texans fan, I'd much prefer they wait until 2024 and take Spencer Rattler, and sign Garoppolo for this year, but that doesn't look it'll happen, so I'm thinking they'll take Bryce Young at number two. I think he's the best quarterback in the draft, and given how many Alabama players Houston's got, namely John Metchie, it'd make a lot of sense. They'll probably also bring in a veteran quarterback for competition purposes, Heinicke's my pick.\n\nCommanders: Sam Howell + Mike White\n\nI think the Commanders are definitely set with Sam Howell at QB1, however Rivera said they're bringing in someone to compete with him for the starting job. Since they already got Howell they're clearly not drafting, and I doubt they'll get Rodgers or Garoppolo either, so I'm guessing they'll bring in Mike White, but ultimately I think Howell's substantially better so he'll win the starting job.","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1678551628.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Joe Flacco throws a 48 yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason!","author":"TigerBasket","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hdlzTolfSoE","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678402409.0},{"title":"Dan Snyder has told other NFL owners that Commanders sale price 'looking good,'","author":"ard8","url":"https:\/\/www.audacy.com\/thefandc\/sports\/washington-commanders\/commanders-sale-price-looking-good-nfl-owners-say","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678393997.0},{"title":"[Tej Seth] The only players with more total expected points added (EPA) than lamar jackson since he entered the league in 2018: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Josh Allen","author":"jethead70","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tejfbanalytics\/status\/1633831486452568064?s=46&t=tiQUBp7PDuO0BoCJl0-Eyg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678371040.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Saquon Barkley Gets the First Down Behind Daniel Jones Lead Block","author":"freefreebradshaw","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/r4EQZd2u0-M","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678412406.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Final play of their 2008 season, Lions finish the season 0-16","author":"guyfierisgoatee1","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/696cg3J4lIE","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678411428.0},{"title":"[Yates] New Jets S Chuck Clark's snaps by alignment last year, per @NextGenStats: Safety: 612 OLB: 133 Slot CB: 128 ILB: 55 Edge: 54 Perimeter CB: 50 IDL: 15 One of the more versatile defenders in the league.","author":"Kimber80","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FieldYates\/status\/1633867509085667329?t=d61rxa_FgABPRoUtqqG0cQ&s=19","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678383723.0},{"title":"Keep seeing the Scott Norwood missed field goal video posted.

They had scored the most points that season via the no-huddle K-gun offensive scheme, while the Giants gave up the fewest points allowed, with a smoldering and attacking defense. (Led by DC Bill Belichick)\n\nThe game was a rematch from the regular season which the Bills won 17-13. The biggest events that, IMO, truly helped the Giants win this game were these factors:\n\nThe Giants managed to maintain possession for a SB record 40+min, helping to keep the high octane Bills offense off the field. \n\nThe Giants held onto the ball for a record 9:21 to open the 3rd quarter, ending in a TD that helped them retake the lead. This after they held the ball for nearly the last 4 min of the 2nd quarter. That's almost an entire quarter of possession straight by the Giants. \nThe big play of the game however, came in the 3rd quarter. The Giants were driving and were on the Bills 24 when Dave Megget breaks off a 2nd down 15yd run only to have it brought back and lose 10 yards due to holding. Jeff Hostetler gains 2 yards, and now the Giants were faced with a 3rd and 13 from the Bills 32. Hostetler fires a 6 yard pass to Mark Ingram, who then proceeds to break free of 5 separate tackles to then lunge forward and pick up the first four a gain of 14 yards. This to me was and always will be, the play that won the game. They go on to score the TD, the Bills get the TD back at the start of the 4th. Giants go ahead with 8min to play on a field goal, and the rest is history.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678407633.0},{"title":"49ers\u2019 Mike McGlinchey expects to be signed quickly once free agency begins: \u201cWe got a lot of intel coming off of the week at the Combine and all that stuff\u2026I think once Monday hits, I\u2019ll probably have a pretty quick deal and a pretty quick decision to make\u2026\u201d","author":"social_distant_joe","url":"https:\/\/www.49erswebzone.com\/articles\/167492-49ers-mike-mcglinchey-expects-signed-quickly-agency-begins\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678378911.0},{"title":"[Rosenthal] Lavonte David could be a good value.

Winning either an MVP or a ring alone is hard enough and is a major selling point for any Hall of Fame candidates, but to do both? It's practically a lock-up....unless your name is Joe Theismann. Why is this the case and why is he not included in the Hall of Fame? He had a winning career record in both the regular and post-season, has a ring, and was the MVP on an historic Washington offense. I suppose you could say he doesn't have many pro bowls, but neither do some of the players on this list, for a multitude of differing reasons, and it's not like pro bowls are generally that important anyhow. If I really want to be an asshole, I could even argue that he has more first team All-Pros than John Elway, which is true (albeit a little misleading).\n\nMy initial theory was that he must've pissed off voters by saying something he shouldn't have, but, to put on my tin foil hat, I thought more about it and I wonder if the league has \"lobbied\" voters to not give a spot to a man who was infamously injured so as to not conjure up the image of how his career ended and further tarnish the reputation of the NFL brand. If that's the case, that's dicked up. That said, it does seem a little far-fetched, to put it diplomatically.\n\nWhat do y'all think about why Joe Theismann didn't make the Hall?\n\nEDIT: Several people have brought to my attention that Kicker Mark Mosely, partially because of league politics and partially because of his excellent play, won both a ring and MVP (both in 82), and is not in the Hall of Fame. While I do think the nature of Special Teams makes direct comparison to members on offense\/defense difficult, it does indicate that Theismann is not the only Washington great to be DISRESPECTED BY NOT GETTING INTO THE HALL OF FAME (\/s).","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678299867.0},{"title":"[Yates] The franchise tag shrunk the top of the the FA RB class, but it's still extremely deep: - Miles Sanders - David Montgomery - Jeff Wilson - Devin Singletary - Damien Harris - Kareem Hunt - Jamaal Williams - Raheem Mostert - Rashaad Penny - Jerick McKinnon - Alexander Mattison","author":"Kimber80","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FieldYates\/status\/1633488899053060096","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678292662.0},{"title":"[Lombardi] If Jimmie Ward is willing to play nickel again for the 49ers, as he indicated on a recent IG Live, SF might be able to fit him into their budget and take care of an important DB position.

Of course the importance of QBs has increased with the importance of a good passing game, but so has the cap (for the most part).  Now the way I see it, it is easy to get caught up in the ever bloating numbers (OMG $40 million a year!!!1!) and forget to look at it as a slice of the pie.\n\nHere is a look at some non-rookie deal QBs currently in the league and where they stack up as percent of cap hit the first year of their deal. \n\n\n|Player|First Year of Contract|Cap in First Year ($M)|Contract Total ($M)|Average ($M) \/ Year|Yearly % of Cap (based on when signed)|Fully Guaranteed ($M)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rodgers|2022|208.2|150.8|50.2|24.11%|101.4|\n|Allen|2021|182.5|258|43|23.56%|100|\n|Wilson|2022|208.2|245|49|23.54%|124|\n|Mahomes|2020|198.2|450|45|22.70%|63|\n|Murray|2022|208.2|230.5|46.1|22.14%|103.3|\n|Watson|2022|208.2|230|46|22.09%|230|\n|Prescott|2021|182.5|160|40|21.92%|95|\n|Stafford|2022|208.2|160|40|19.21%|63|\n|Goff|2021|182.5|143|33.5|18.36%|57|\n|Jones|2023|224.8|160|40|17.79%|82|\n|Carr|2023|224.8|150|37.5|16.68%|60|\n|Cousins|2023|224.8|35|35|15.57%|70|\n|Tannehill|2020|198.2|118|29.5|14.88%|62|\n|Geno Smith|2023|224.8|75|25|11.12%|30|\n\n\n\n**Considerations:** Now I'll be the first to admit that this is FAR from the end all be all.  It doesn't really account for guarantees (I included that column for some further context) and doesn't account for frontloaded deals or how the cap will further inflate a year or two from now.  What it *DOES* do is allow us a peak into the mind of a GM in the moment they were negotiating with the QB they were re-signing.  They knew his production.  They knew the cap number for the next season.  They knew their upcoming cap situation and roster.  And *this* is the amount of the pie they were ok with slicing off for them (on an APV basis).\n\n**Subjective takeaways:** First thing that jumps out at me is the Seahawks and Geno have a win-win (if he doesn't regress at a crazy rate).  Either he plays pretty decent for relatively cheap or he becomes a bridge QB on a cuttable contract.  Second, I don't like the Kyler contract.  And finally (and the motivation for throwing this together) the Danny Dimes contract isn't that bad compared to the crowd.  On a percentage basis he's getting paid similar to a Tannehill or Goff, which is roughly right.  And if he REALLY falls off the contact isn't a total black hole.\n\n\nShout out to overthecap and [excel to reddit](https:\/\/xl2reddit.github.io\/).

Intro\n\nI have no clue how to describe this season. Coming off a 2021 season riddled with injuries, the Ravens made the playoffs at 10-7 despite Lamar Jackson's season ending injury and Demarcus freaking Robinson at WR1. The defense choking to start the season was rough, but the trade for Roquan Smith solidified a top 10 defense by total yards. Rookies Tyler Linderbaum and Kyle Harrison had great rookie seasons as well as TE Isaiah Likely showing a lot of potential. They even had Tyler Huntley (somehow) get selected to a pro bowl.\n\nHowever, there were a few rough parts to the season. Starting WRs Rashod Bateman and Devin Duvernay(who is also very good at returning kicks) were both out for the season by Week 8. The big injury was losing star QB Lamar Jackson to a knee injury in a Week 13 contest vs Denver. The Ravens choked away four games. This team could've easily been 14-3 EVEN WITHOUT LAMAR JACKSON FOR SIX WEEKS. Lamar was the only thing that kept the offense actually running but his injury absolutely decimated the offense. In the six regular season games where he got hurt, the offense put up a pitiful 5 touchdowns. Even though the Ravens made the playoffs, they fumbled the game away as a bad playcall and execution led to a go-ahead 98 yard fumble return TD for the Bengals.\n\n# \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6nvnti3arima1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=885775c09f451e947393d0226e8d258bfebebfa2\n\n# 2. The Offseason\n\nThe Ravens had a very important offseason coming off of 2021. First of all, Lamar Jackson was in the final year of his rookie contract and the Ravens needed to extend their best player. They also had needs at safety, inside linebacker, wide receiver, and center. But the main question was: Can this team show up in big moments? (And not get absolutely decimated by injuries)\n\n# 3. Offseason FA Additions\/Losses\n\nMajor Additions:\n\n* **Marcus Williams(S):** Signed a 5 year, $70 million deal - March 15th\n   * Definitely the best signing the Ravens made this offseason. Although he was limited to 10 games due to injury, Williams tied his career high of 4 interceptions and was a major part of the defense.\n* **Morgan Moses(T):** Signed a 3 year, $15 million deal - March 15th\n   * He was a pretty good tackle for the Ravens as he started all 17 games and had a PFF grade of 78.1(I know I know PFF bad but I\u2019m kinda bad at evaluating OL)\n* **Michael Pierce(DT):** Signed a 3 year, $16.5 million deal - March 17th\n   * Pierce came back after his stint with Minnesota didn\u2019t work too well. However, Michael Pierce was only able to start 3 games as he went on season ending IR with a torn biceps.\n* **Mike Davis(RB):** Signed a 1 year, 1.2 million deal - May 10th\n   * Davis had like 6 carries all season he was useless.\n* **Brent Urban(DT):** Signed at 1 year, $1.1 million deal - May 20th\n   * Another Raven returned: this time it was Brent Urban. However, he did not have much of an impact on the defense.\n* **Kyle Fuller(CB):** Signed a 1 year, $2.5 million deal - May 24th\n   * He played one game before tearing his ACL. Because of course he did.\n* **Demarcus Robinson(WR):** Signed a 1 year, $1 million deal - August 23rd\n   * Due to some unforeseen circumstances, Drob somehow ended up as the Ravens WR1. He was ok.\n* **Kenyan Drake(RB):** Signed a 1 year, $1 million deal - August 31st\n   * Drake filled in for Gus Edwards, who had been rehabbing from his ACL tear from last season. Drake was fine on the ground, recording 482 rushing yards and 4 tds.\n\nMajor Losses:\n\n* **Anthony Levine Sr(S):** Retired - January 26th\n   * \u201cCo-Cap\u201d was a special teams stud for the Ravens and had been on the team since 2012. He retired and took over a scouting role for the Ravens.\n* **Tavon Young(CB):** Signed with the Chicago Bears - March 9th\n   * Tavon was a damn good slot corner but he could never stay healthy as he only played in 34 games since his amazing rookie season.\n* **Alejandro Villanueva(T):** Retired - March 9th\n   * Bad man can\u2019t hurt us anymore.\n* **Bradley Bozeman(C):** Signed with the Carolina Panthers - March 18th\n   * Bozeman not re-signing was a bit of a surprise for Ravens fans. However, his replacement Tyler Linderbaum was very good during his rookie season.\n* **Deshon Elliot(S):** Signed with the Detroit Lions - April 13th\n   * He was one of those dudes that was pretty good but could never stay healthy (essentially Tavon Young but in safety form). Although I had criticized the Ravens for failing to re-sign him, I was okay with it after the Ravens drafted Kyle Hamilton.\n* **Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown(WR):** Traded to the Arizona Cardinals along with a third round pick for the Cardinals' first round pick(1.23) - April 28th\n   * Although it hurt to see the best Ravens receiver drafted since Torrey Smith get traded, it felt like it was needed. Hollywood was not happy with the offensive play calling and especially Greg Roman and the Ravens felt like his catching issues were too much of a problem for the team.\n* **Sam Koch(P):** Retired after 16 seasons with the Ravens - May 19th\n   * It sucks to see the Wolfpack being broken up. After Morgan Cox left Baltimore to sign with the Titans(ew), 16 year vet Sam Koch announced his retirement. It was necessary for the Ravens to move on from Koch this season anyways, as he had been declining and the Ravens really needed to get younger at the position.\n* **Derek Wolfe(DE):** Retired after 10 seasons in the NFL - June 14th\n   * Pretty disappointing extension for the Ravens, as Wolfe did not play a single game for Baltimore after signing a 3 year extension last season.\n\n# 4. 2022 NFL Draft - written by [u\/-Anguscr4p-](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/-Anguscr4p-)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6mqyy0zbrima1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1b4a9887e08a16d26ba901a0374bba46bf72f96\n\n|Round|Pick|Player Name|Position|College|My Draft Day Grade|PFF Top 250 Prospect Rank|Daniel Jeremiah Top 150 Prospect Rank|WalterFootball Live Draft Grades|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|14|Kyle Hamilton|S|Notre Dame|B|8|5|C|\n|1|25|Tyler Linderbaum|C|Iowa|A|16|27|A-|\n|2|45|David Ojabo|EDGE|Michigan|A|50|49|A+|\n|3|76|Travis Jones|DT|UConn|A+|27|37|A+|\n|4|110|Daniel Faalele|OT|Minnesota|B+|157|98|B+|\n|4|119|Jayln Armour-Davis|CB|Alabama|B|92|81|A-|\n|4|128|Charlie Kolar|TE|Iowa State|A+|156|106|A-|\n|4|130|Jordan Stout|P|Penn State|D|\\-|148|\\-|\n|4|139|Isaiah Likely|TE|Coastal Carolina|D|232|124|C|\n|4|141|Damarion \"Pepe\" Williams|CB|Houston|C|\\-|\\-|C+|\n|6|196|Tyler Badie|RB|Missouri|C+|176|\\-|A-|\n\n# [Rookie Draft Grades](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11lx312\/comment\/jbei78u\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# [Rookie Draft Grades Pt. 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nfl\/comments\/11lx312\/comment\/jbeiekl\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# 5. Preseason\n\nThe Ravens continued their preseason win streak, as they extended the record to 23 consecutive wins. The Ravens beat Tennessee 23-10, beat Arizona 24-17, and beat Washington 17-15. However, the Ravens failed to sign Lamar Jackson to an extension before the end of preseason, and Lamar openly said that he would not discuss an extension during the regular season\/postseason.\n\n# 6. Regular Season\n\n**Week 1(@ Jets):**\n\nThe Ravens dominated the entire game. With the Jets bringing out the remaining corpse of Elite Dragon Joe Flacco, their offense couldn\u2019t get anything done. Lamar Jackson threw 3 TDs as the team snapped their 6 game losing streak from last season.\n\n**Record: 1-0**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 2(vs Dolphins):**\n\nThe Dolphins had a 35-14 lead going into the fourth quarter, but they outscored the Ravens 28-3, and they gave up a game-winning touchdown with 14 seconds left to make the final score 42-38. With his 79-yard touchdown run in the third quarter of a losing effort, Jackson eclipsed Michael Vick for the most 100-yard rushing games by a quarterback, throwing for 318 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 119 yards and one. After the defeat, the Ravens lost to the Dolphins for the second week in a row and fell to 1-1 overall. Hopefully this trend of blowing games doesn't continue throughout the season(ominious foreshadowing).\n\n**Record: 1-1**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oxnw4mxorima1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ff9061cad1b1062485d34ec8d1552ac92a5d5af\n\n**Week 3(@ Patriots):**\n\nLamar put up another Jackson 5 as the Ravens get their first regular season road win in Foxborough in franchise history and their first road win against New England since the 2012 AFc Championship game. Mark Andrews had two receiving TDs and Marcus Peters had a pretty solid game with an INT and a forced fumble.\n\n**Record: 2-1**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2tiio5lqrima1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9780dde09aa75d40d5f8171b9e1f6bba7600f2d3\n\n**Week 4(vs Bills):**\n\nOh look, another blown lead. This is great. After leading 20-3, the Ravens give up 20 unanswered point to Josh Allen and the Bills as Baltimore falls to 2-2. This was a very winnable game and would've looked very good for the Ravens.\n\n**Record: 2-2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 5(vs Bengals):**\n\nI love Justin Tucker so much. As time ran out in a 19-17 victory over the Bengals, Justin Tucker kicked the game-winning field goal of 43 yards, saving the Ravens from yet another Bengals comeback attempt. After the victory, the Ravens advanced to 3-2, ended a six-game home losing run, and took over first place in the AFC North.\n\n**Record: 3-2**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 6(@ Giants):**\n\nThis shit gotta stop man. STOP BLOWING LEADS THIS ISN'T THAT HARD TO DO. Following two Lamar Jackson turnovers in the game's last three minutes, the Ravens lost to the Giants 20-24 after blowing their third double-digit lead in five games. The Ravens are now 3-3, and it was Jackson's first career defeat to an NFC opponent.\n\n**Record: 3-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 7(vs Browns):**\n\nI should probably stop watching these games for my mental wellbeing. With a 23-20 home victory over the Browns, the Ravens managed to hold onto first place in the AFC North. In his first game back from an injury since the 2020 postseason, Ravens RB Gus Edwards scored two rushing touchdowns, and LB In the last two minutes of regulation, Malik Harrison blocked Cade York from making a 60-yard field goal that would have tied the score. The Ravens improved to 4-3 with the victory.\n\n**Record: 4-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bs9jp52srima1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27c5456d570579cffd0ee42e6a1b1775af865044\n\n**Week 8(@ Buccaneers):**\n\nThe Ravens had a poor first half, scoring just three points while surrendering 10. Yet, it appears that a break was all they required to resolve their problems, as they started the second half strongly. The Ravens drove into the end zone three times in a row after driving Tom Brady and the Buccaneers into a three-and-out. They exited Raymond James Stadium with a 27-22 triumph. However, Rashod Bateman suffered a foot injury in the second quarter of this game and would be out for the year.\n\n**Record: 5-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Breaking News:** Ravens trade a 2nd round pick and a 5th round pick in exchange for ILB Roquan Smith.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l2z1mxzxrima1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b178f0023a21b1a7e843d933fd86d3a6d792019\n\n**Week 9(@ Saints):**\n\nThe Ravens had a pretty easy game against Andy Dalton and the Saints. Isaiah Likely scored on early in the game, but was pretty bad for the rest of the game as he only had one catch the entire game. However, because the Ravens passing offense works like complete garbage, Likely led the team in receiving yards with 24 yards. Kenyan Drake scored twice and looked very good and Justin Houston's performance with 2.5 sacks and an INT led to him earning AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors.\n\n**Record: 6-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 10(vs Bye Week):**\n\nThings we know: The Ravens are good, but very inconsistent. The offense is very on and off and the defense had struggled until recently (luv you Roquan). With the easiest part of the schedule coming up, the Ravens should surely win at least 6 of these 8 remaining games(foreshadowing).\n\n**Record: 6-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 11(vs Panthers):**\n\nI have no knowledge of this game. I completely forgot this game occurred. No commentary about this one as I don't believe this game actually happened. But for real, 13 FREAKING POINTS AGAINST THE PANTHERS? THE PANTHERS OF ALL TEAMS? COME ON MAN THIS IS COMING OFF OF A BYE WEEK WHERE DID THIS OFFENSE GO? Good job on the defense though Baker was pretty bad. Demarcus Robinson also had 128 receiving yards.\n\n**Record: 7-3**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 12(@ Jaguars):**\n\nSTOP BLOWING LEADS THIS IS GETTING SO DAMN ANNOYING. I HATE THIS SHIT PLEASE STOP. The Baltimore Ravens traveled to Jacksonville to attempt to pick up their fourth straight victory after winning their previous three games in a row. However, after taking a small lead, the Ravens completely lost their composure, allowing the Jaguars to come back and win the game with a score by Marvin Jones Jr. and a two-point conversion by Zay Jones. In the very end of the game, Justin Tucker tried a field goal that, if successful, would have broken his own NFL record for the longest field goal ever made, but it was short, and the Jaguars survived. DeSean Jackson made his only career highlight in a Ravens uniform as he caught a massive deep ball from Lamar.\n\n**Record: 7-4**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 13(vs Broncos):**\n\nThings were looking great until Lamar Jackson got hurt. Although it didn't look too big at the time, he would be ruled out for the game and the season, which kinda sucks. The offense was shit without Lamar but because the Ravens were playing Hackjob Hackett and Russell Wilson, they were able to pull out a win late.\n\n**Record: 8-4**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4m7vkae2sima1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4a8846ff4596e5e902824bacc8bc9af76f10dc9\n\n**Week 14(@ Steelers):**\n\nMitch Trubisky sucks man. Holy crap this should've been a blowout loss if it weren't for the defense forcing 3 INTs and a Chris Boswell FG attempt being blocked. Outside of Dobbins having a 120 yard game and a TD, the Ravens struggled to get things going for most of the game. Ravens fans had a bit of a heartattack when Huntley went down with a concussion as the Ravens were stuck with Anthony Brown. Luckily, Huntley was able to return next game.\n\n**Record: 9-4**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 15(@ Browns):**\n\nAn overall disappointing game. The Ravens traveled to Cleveland to face the Browns in the second game of the Saturday Night Tripleheader. After trading field goals, the first quarter's score changed to 0-0 to favor the Browns. Professional rapist Deshaun Watson's touchdown pass to Donovan Peoples-Jones in the third quarter raised the score to 13-3. The game's final score was thus. After the loss, the Baltimore Ravens lost 1st place in the division since the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n**Record: 9-5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 16(vs Falcons):**\n\nWith this win over Atlanta, the Ravens clinched a playoff spot and returned to the postseason for the first time since 2020. The Ravens only touchdown this game was a Demarcus Robinson receiving TD. Gus Edwards was pretty good as he averaged 9 yards\/carry.\n\n**Record: 10-5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zvw7fkc4sima1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6dd957fb0c407f773e03fba315df878a9b2d715a\n\n**Week 17(vs Steelers):**\n\nThe Ravens were up 13-9 and the Steelers needed to drive down the entire field to score. However, the Ravens defense failed to hold on against Kenny Pickett as he threw a game winning TD to Najee Harris with less than a minute left. Because the Ravens offense runs as well as a broken down car, Baltimore couldn't drive the ball into field goal range before time ran out.\n\n**Record: 10-6**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Week 18(@ Bengals):**\n\nWith Baltimore resting most of their starters, the Bengals easily beat the Ravens 27-16. Anthony Brown got the start and was pretty bad as he had multiple costly turnovers that turned a close game into a double digit loss.\n\n**Record: 10-7**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 7.

Playoffs\n\n**Super Wild Card(@ Bengals):**  [Highlights](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=THd7QcGtOes)\n\nThe Ravens went to Cincinnati for a second straight week to play against the Bengals. After a disappointing Week 18 performance, the Ravens actually were surprisingly competitive. A game that was close the entire time slips away as Tyler Huntley fumbles on a QB sneak led to a Sam Hubbard td. If that fumble hadn't happened, the Ravens likely would've won that game. However, Baltimore was stuck with another early playoff exit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the play that screwed over the entire Ravens season](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8goyn058sima1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4b5b35023343b65e14c9206257bd2cc3b4b4ccb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 9. Coaching Review\n\n**Head Coach John Harbaugh:**\n\nHarbaugh isn\u2019t on the hot seat, but his seat is slightly warm. The Ravens haven\u2019t made the AFC Championship game since 2012 and now it\u2019s been 10 years since they won the Super Bowl. He\u2019s not a bad coach, but the team isn\u2019t showing much results.\n\n**Grade: 6\/10**\n\n**Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken:**\n\nLove the hiring. Greg Roman was literally a terrorist for how bad his play calling was. Georgia\u2019s offense last season was super well run and I believe he is a perfect fit for the offense.\n\n**Grade: NG, just got hired**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New OC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l54op7ibsima1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1e80780c67a40a54ad4a9180ee345b24930d718)\n\n**Defensive Coordinator Mike Macdonald:**\n\nHad a shaky start as the team choked away tons of winnable games. However, one Roquan Smith acquisition(and a bit of an easy schedule) helped him turn things around. I think he\u2019s a good DC and should be fine.\n\n**Grade: 7\/10**\n\n# 10. Team Needs (with the plan that Lamar Jackson will be the Ravens starting QB in 2023)\n\n1. **Wide Receiver:** No team should have Demarcus Robinson as their WR1. I understand injuries had played a role in the diminished Ravens WR room, but the overall core is still extremely weak even when the WR room is fully healthy.\n2. **Cornerback:** With Marcus Peters becoming a free agent, Baltimore is in need for a CB2 alongside Humphrey.\n3. **Runningback:** The Ravens have struggled to find a long term, healthy runningback option since Ray Rice. Gus Bus and JK are a good duo, but they struggle to stay on the field.\n\n# 11. Conclusion\n\nThank you to u\/ehhhhhhhhhhmacarena for letting me do this again.

I don't see that deal getting done at this stage simply because of the contracts singed this week.   \n\n\nIf you are Kirk, you want more $$ than both of these guys with more GTD $$ as well. If you are the Vikings, how can you justify adding to the cap % and commitment to Kirk when you are already significantly over the cap already and needing to cut vets just to get compliant.   \n\n\nThey will likely hit an impasse and Kirk will play out the last year of his deal or get traded.   \n\n\n**Using the same logic what do the Titans do with Tannehill? What to the Dolphins do with Tua?**   \n\n\nI guess, the core of the question is.
