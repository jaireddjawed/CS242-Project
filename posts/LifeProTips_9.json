Something was wrong with its leg so when it tried to hop away it would just flop onto its side.\n\nWe have kids and pets and are worried about any ticks or diseases that could be transferred so we got a shovel and gently lifted it out of the garden, but then didn't know what to do with it.\n\nApparently, there are people in every city whose jobs are to rescue these little critters (and bigger critters).  I sent a picture and some information and they asked me to get gloves and put the bunny into a dark quiet place until they can come to pick him up tonight.  I'm just glad to know there are people out there who can take help these little creatures.\n\nThere was a time when someone would yeet this cute little bunny over a fence and let nature sort it out.  Wildlife Rehabilitator was just a number I never knew was available to call.",

        "text": "I‚Äôve been looking for somewhere to post this and hopefully not break any rules. It‚Äôs life-saving advice and needs to be heard somewhere.\n\nThere was a viral post on the internet years ago about how you can use the metal prongs on the headrest of a car seat to break the window in an emergency, specifically if you were in a car sinking in water. Many people, like me, have seen the post and have that nugget of information stored just in case.\n\nRecently I witnessed a car accident where a vehicle flipped over and 4 occupants were trapped inside. Thinking of that post, I grabbed a headrest and slammed the prongs into the window from a standing position at least a dozen times. They could not puncture or shatter an intact window- and that‚Äôs with about a dozen large swings from a grown man in a standing position.\n\nI then attempted the same thing again on a cracked window. On around the 6th swing, it punctured the window. The 8th swing dislodged the window enough for it to be pulled open to allow the occupants to escape.\n\nIt worked out, but I kept thinking about that tip I had read. From a sitting position in a cramped car sinking in water, breaking the window that way would probably be a futile waste of time and energy. Maybe there‚Äôs a better way, but I think people should know that the headrest-prong tip doesn‚Äôt seem to hold much water.\n\nJust wanted to share that with the world. Hopefully it‚Äôll help someone. Consider buying one of those small handy window breaker pins or something else in case of an emergency.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/11l5yvq/lpt_you_can_find_affordable_healthcare_without/",
        "text": "I currently work as a healthcare navigator and have been doing so for almost two years (TLDR: I assist those with private/supplement insurance to find affordable healthcare or assist with negotiating medical bills). I'm making this post to let people know what I've learned and how to save money on medical services and avoid financial burdens. (Note: I am US based and this will apply only to people in the USA...most likely. We're the only ones who would need this anyway. Ok, no ranting. Here we go.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Bills are negotiable.**\n\nMany medical providers are willing to be flexible with medical bills depending on your situation. Please always talk with a financial advisor in the billing department about your options. Even if you can pay a medical bill, there could always be options and flexibility to lessen the financial burden. \n\nSadly, there is something called balanced billing where a provider will send the full amount of the bill to the member, also known as surprise billing. Many providers and hospitals are implementing no-surprise billing policies which is a step up, but not all states have adopted these policies yet and those with and without insurance that get balanced billed are put into immediate financial stress.\n\nOne thing to note about medical bills is that they usually are sent to collections within 3 months after the due date. A final notice should be given and if you are still disputing or negotiating your medical bills, you can make minimum monthly payments to keep it in good standing until things conclude. Smaller medical bills have a lower chance of being negotiated. I would say a provider would not be willing to negotiate anything under $100.00 usually.\n\n**The most common negotiation options are:**\n\nA) **Special programming** (Ex. Financial assistance, qualifying program, discounts)\n\nB) **Settlement offer**. A lump sum one-time payment towards the bill. (Ex. Pay 50% of the bill in one payment, and the other 50% gets written off. Factors such as income, household size, and fair-price estimate are considered for this.)\n\nC) **Monthly payment plan**. (If your bill does or doesn't get reduced through negotiation and has a remaining amount, this option is usually still available.)\n\nD) For those with insurance receiving an uncovered medical bill, check in with your insurance to see if they offer out-of-pocket reimbursement.\n\nI'm sure you've heard of this before, but I would recommend requesting an itemized statement for your medical bill. It is not guaranteed, but it can lower your medical bill by requesting one. Even if it doesn't, you have a full list of your charges for that medical visit and this can be especially useful when you visit an ER or hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Self-pay (Cash-pay) patients receive significant discounts.**\n\nJust because you have insurance does not mean you will always be covered or that you even have to present it when receiving medical services. Self-pay patients receive big discounts on certain medical services like lab testing, imaging (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans), procedures such as colonoscopies, and even primary care/hospital visits. *(Please note, many insurance plans may actually cover or mostly cover these procedures. Please check with your insurance first to make sure that self-pay pricing is actually cheaper.)* \n\nI've seen people go to an in-network doctor for a colonoscopy but still receive a bill of $5000.00. With websites like [colonoscopyassist.com](https://colonoscopyassist.com) or [MDsave.com](https://MDsave.com), self-pay patients can get a colonoscopy for between $1200.00 - $2000.00. It is important to note that these prices are **INCLUSIVE**, meaning all fees are included. Payment options are usually available too through monthly payment plans or CareCredit. \n\n**I've listed some examples below that I will try to update periodically if needed**. *Simply type in your zip code along with the procedure name or CPT Code. (A CPT Code is a 5-digit procedural code that identifies the specific procedure needed*):\n\n**Imaging (X-rays, CTs, MRIs, Mammograms, Etc):**\n\n[Radiologyassist.com](https://Radiologyassist.com)\n\n[MDsave.com](https://MDsave.com) \n\n**Discounted labs: (*****Will typically send you to a LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics)***\n\n[ultalabs.com](https://ultalabs.com)\n\n[grassrootslabs.com](https://grassrootslabs.com)\n\n[findlabtest.com](https://findlabtest.com) \n\n[anylabtestnow.com](https://anylabtestnow.com) \n\n**Coupons for prescriptions:**\n\n[goodrx.com](https://goodrx.com)\n\n[rxsaver.com](https://rxsaver.com)\n\n[costsplusdrugs.com](https://costsplusdrugs.com)\n\n**Therapists/Psychiatrists/Psychologists:**\n\n[psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com)\n\n**Colonoscopies:**\n\n[colonoscopyassist.com](https://colonoscopyassist.com)\n\n[MDsave.com](https://MDsave.com)\n\n**Surgical:**\n\n[MDsave.com](https://MDsave.com) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for primary care doctors, they will usually offer self-pay discounts but that can still end up being $100.00 - $200.00 for an initial visit (Traditionally, established self-pay patients pay less per visit). \n\nNowadays, self-pay patients have a new primary care system they can find called **Direct Primary Care** (DPC). DPC does not accept insurance but instead is membership based. Usually, these memberships include unlimited doctor visits, discounts on labs and prescriptions, annual physicals, therapy, and more. I personally had a DPC in the past for about $80.00/mo and I could even text them questions whenever. These providers usually offer lower pricing depending on family size and age. It is also worth noting that price transparency has been increasingly more common in recent years and many hospital/provider websites will have a price list to get a cost estimate.\n\nThese are some ways you can save money on your healthcare needs. I will continue to update this list if needed from research I find or from suggestions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\\-Aybe",
