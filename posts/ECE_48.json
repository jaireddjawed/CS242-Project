        "text": "First off, I have read the sidebar FAQs. My questions are tech support in nature but have heavy electrical engineering implications (in my mind) making this post acceptable. Mods, please feel free to correct me and delete my post. \n\nOkay, long story short. I have an LG 47LN5200 that had the backlights fail on me. I tested all the boards, etc, and everything appears to be within specs; all signs point exclusively to backlight failure, which is common with this set from my research. I was going to buy a new backlight kit but everywhere that actually has new ones sells them for too much making this already fiscally questionable repair totally not worth it. I could buy a used set for around $50 but I think that is still overpriced for a used set that for all I know will fail on me in a few short months.\n\nTO MY QUESTIONS....\n\nI buy things off of craigslist and resell/fix them. I recently bought an LG 50LF6090 with a damaged screen ($10 for everything!) and plan on harvesting the guts to sell. The backlights work perfectly in this set. I have yet to find the specific specs of these backlights to see how many total volts/watts per each LED on the busbars, I’m in the very preliminary stages of this (foolhardy?) endeavor and know this info is important…but IF, after I trimmed these strips to fit (50” down to 47”, lopping off an LED or few and reinsulating the exposed ends), could these serve as a viable replacement in your opinion? I know the LEDs would likely have minor coloration differences, and presumably be askew from where the original ones and were aligned but don’t anticipate this will have a large impact given the various diffusers. \n\nI know essentially all components, on a board level, of a TV are generally specific to that set but to me it seems like the backlight is a very “stupid” component of an otherwise intelligent system. Meaning that, if the voltages sent from the LED driver circuit of the 47LN5200 PSU are consistent at around X volts then couldn’t those X volts supply power to essentially any vaguely similar spec’d LEDs wired in series? I’d guess the wattages are also likely different from the original LEDs but believe this could be adjusted for as follows.\n\nI’m in medicine, not a electrical engineer by any means and my physics skills are admittedly rusty. But it seems to me that if the original power supply was trying to keep the volts at 5V per LED, x9 leds = 45Volts in total per strip (totally guessing with those figures for purposes of speed of this post), then couldn’t I just use any LEDs with use of diodes and/or resistors with these replacement strips to keep the voltages in that range so the PSU keeps pumping out the volts and doesn’t go into safe mode? \n\nSorry for the wall of text. For all of you who have read this far please give me your sincere and educated thoughts on this questionable project. I know it would be far easier to just buy a different TV and organ harvest both to recoup my losses but don’t want to do that because I’m stubborn as hell. In my mind this appears to be an entirely plausible and cheap solution. \n\nGoing to cross post this on various subs. Again, please feel free to delete if I post against any rules, it wasn't my intention. Just wanted to solicit opinions of those with much greater background into what I plan. \n\nTHANK YOU!!!!\n",

        "text": "(Cross posted with /r/engineeringstudents)\n\nHello!\nI am currently studying electrical engineering at a large state university, planning to have my 'emphasis' be systems and controls (vs. something like VLSI, communications, etc.). I will be starting in on my first controls course this fall. The reason I chose controls was due to my participation in FTC Robotics back in high school - I like robotics quite a bit. I have been lucky enough to have 2 internships so far, both with the same company. Before I graduate with a bachelor's, I will have the opportunity to get one more internship.\nAs I stand currently, I can graduate with my BS in EE in 3 semesters. This doesn't require a huge course load at all - 14, 16, and 16 credit semesters. I can handle it, I have a 4.0 so far. My other option is to take 5 semesters and get both my BS in EE as well as a Master's of Engineering in EE (again, systems and controls). I'd do this in 5 semesters by taking advantage of my school's option to take some courses that dual-count towards my grad degree as well as my undergrad. I can complete 15 credits of a masters by the time I'd finish my BS in 8 semesters, leaving me with a summer of 3 credits+internship, as well as one more semester of 12 credits to get the ME.\nThis is a pretty tough decision! I'd love to hear your opinions about this, from a variety of perspectives.\nFirst off, money. Will I earn more money with an ME? What about an MS? Both are options, I'm just not interested in research. Getting the masters would remove me from a full year's salary (~$70K), as well as the cost of school for the year (~$20K). I would get one additional internship, however, which would probably earn me close to $11K.\nFrom a happiness perspective, I'm getting burned out on school. Courses are getting harder, which stinks, but I think I can handle the course load. I just don't know if I WANT to do it for another year. During the summer, I love working my 8-9 hour day, coming home, and forgetting about it. (well, I'm taking online classes over the summer, but you get what I mean!). I would be missing out on some extra time with good friends I've made, but I think I could live with that.\nFrom an 'employability' perspective, how would this affect how much employers want me? With two internships under my belt by the end of this summer, 2 years with a 4.0 GPA so far, as well as president of an engineering organization at my school, I think I'm sitting in a comfortable position to secure a job at most places if I keep busting my ass to get there.\nAgain, what are your thoughts?

This would also serve as a nice benchmark to where we actually stand among software/other disciplines.\n\n\n[Copying text from the thread above] Glassdoor data for new graduate positions is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish signing bonus and equity numbers alongside salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until late in the year, long past offer deadlines. In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, let's follow the following format (same as the thread above):\n\nFor each commenter:\n\n* Target School: Yes/No [= Top 10 EE ranked schools (MIT,Stan, GaTech, UIUC, Michigan, etc.)\n* Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}\n* Major/Concentration:\n* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious\n* OPT: Interned At:\n* Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No\n* Company: $name\n* Location:\n* Position Title:\n* Salary:\n* Signing Bonus:\n * Caveats or Obligations:\n* Equity or Stock Grant:\n * Vesting Period/Earn Out:\n* Application Method: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...\n* Application Process: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. Applied: 9/25, Offered: 10/12 or a detailed explanation of the interview process.

[This transimpedance amplifier](http://imgur.com/a/zyjcc) is a pretty great reference as it faces the same source voltage restrictions as my design (Vcc = 3.3V), but I am having difficulties analyzing it completely and therefore suiting it to my needs.\n\nHow does Rb set the output offset voltage? And how do I calculate how Rb and Rf have to a certain output swing?\n\nTo connect it to my ADC the output swing would ideally have to be from 0.2V to 1.2V, so I'd have to play around with the values of Rb and Rf to cope with values of Rs from 100Ω to 3kΩ. (Or something like that and add a voltage divider at the output.) Right now Vout = 3.1V with Rs = 100Ω and Vout = 0.65V with Rs = 3kΩ.\n\nThe output formula should be\n\n    Vo = Rf*Vcc/2 (1/Rs + 1/Rf - 1/Rb)        \nor \n\n    Vo = Vcc/2 * (1 - Rf*(Rs-Rb)/(Rs*Rb))\n\nAnyways, if anybody has an idea on how to change these output values in a consistent way I would be very thankful.

I have a camera project I'm working on where the original camera in the system I'm working on cost about $3k and I'm trying to replace the internal camera module with a cheaper replacement. Long story short I was trying to use a 7805 voltage regulator to bring the 24 volts down to the 5 volts I need for the camera module, this allows the camera to work fine but the LED lights won't light up as bright as they will on an unaltered camera unit. The LEDs work off of a potentiometer that adjusts the current going to them and always maintains the 24 volts coming out. Is there any different voltage regulator I can use that will draw less current and allow the LED lights the full functionality they have before modifying the camera? The camera module has to run at 5 volts at 120mA.\nThank you for your help.",

Using the Atmel-ICE JTAG programmer/debugger, I am unable to communicate with the MCU.\n \nSome notes on what I've tried/done so far:\n\n* The TST pin is pulled high at startup, and is high throughout the attempted connection.\n* I am able to communicate with the chip over UART, but not if the TST pin is pulled high either at startup or while the chip is on.\n* Using an oscilloscope I've been able to confirm that the programmer is sending a clock signal and some data over TDI, but the processor is not responding.\n* When I try to connect to the chip (all of this is using Atmel Studio 7.0) The NRST pin is pulled low for a moment then high. After the pin returns to high, the voltage level on the SWDN pin is low, indicating the chip is in backup mode. Pulling FWUP low or high doesn't seem to bring the chip out. \n* The chip is using the external 12MHz oscillator, but when it goes into low power mode it shuts off. This also presumably shuts down the core.\n* The 32.768KHz oscillator is never active, but if I remember correctly the datasheet says it won't be used unless a register is set to a certain value.\n \n[I've attached a schematic of the board](http://www.avrfreaks.net/sites/default/files/forum_attachments/dev%20sch.png). I've made a few minor changes not shown here, just adding pull up/down resistors in some places that I missed on the schematic.\n \nCan anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong here?",

        "text": "Hiya! First post here, and if this isn't an appropriate sub, I'd love advice on where I should ask.  (Actual EE question, promise)\n\nFriends are getting a tent, and I'm considering options for providing power to at least the apex of the [model they've chosen](https://lotusbelle.com/collections/16ft-lotus-belle-tents/products/5m-hybrid).  My ideal would be to run a pair or bundle from a hole in the side that is used for ventilation up to the apex where it could provide power for such things as 5v LED lighting and a USB charger that might hang from the roof.  \n\nI know set up time on a tent is a big deal, especially as this will be going to Burning Man and similar hostile environments.  Because of that, my preference would be to fasten the wiring semi-permanently, and that take down will not stress the wiring in such a way as to cause shorts in the assembly.  \n\nI will do the appropriate research on long run wiring that is not likely to deteriorate in the heat and cold (silicone sheathing or somesuch) but I'd like to create a fox and hound style tester that could be quickly hooked up to test for shorts or issues before hooking in to a solid voltage source that might cause issues or damage equipment.   \n\nMy initial idea is to just cob up a micro controller hound that would start by just sending 5v behind a PTC that would  prevent big issues if there's a short.  On the fox side, it lights up an led. If we get light,  we flip a switch on the fox, and get a loop back on that end.  Send and receive packets while checking for losses.  Perhaps step up the frequency?   This is where I'm lost, I'm afraid.  \n\n\nFrom a strain relief stand point, all care would be taken including attaching maximum relief chocks (picture a v groove idler with the wire affixed) at any spot where much flex would be expected, but I like the idea of at least having a reasonable amount of confidence that the wiring is sound.   \n\nI've considered CAT 5/6 as an option because I can reliably power 12v and 5v with it at low currents, and I know Paul at PJRC has used it for powering small portions of  LED arrays.  Also, existing commodity CAT X fox/hound units are easily found cheap, but I've never heard amazing things about it's ability to survive flexion, and I don't know of any varieties that come with very robust internal wire sheathing.  \n\nAnnnnd I'm done rambling.  \n\nTL;DR: got a bundle of wires that are going to flex frequently and be exposed to temperatures from 30°F to 115°F for extended periods of time and I want to be able to test to make sure that no shorts have developed.

I don't need component values checked, but rather the structure and connection of things. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/cw1co\n\nThe first picture is the microcontroller itself with several pin headers. I have a 2x3 pin header for the BOOT0 and BOOT1 pins that will allow me to enter the bootloader using jumpers. I also have 2 1x2 pin headers that will allow me to connect two of the CBUS pins on my FTDI chip to the NRST and BOOT0 pins. I did this because I may want to experiment with programming the FTDI chip to trigger a reset into the bootloader using these two CBUS pins. I also have another 1x2 pin header for the SWD interface, because I will want to experiment with that as well. \n\nThe second picture is the power supply and the usb-to-serial circuit. I am using an LM1117 to convert the USB's 5V to 3.3V for the MCU. The D+ and D- lines go to the FT232R chip for conversion to UART, which is what I will use for programming the microcontroller through USB once I'm in the bootloader. ",

However, I realize it is inherently dangerous to work with the voltages and amperages used in this project especially in the manner the video creator used. \n\nI wanted to know if there are other dangers and pitfalls to look out for other than the risk of electrocution.\n\nSuch as the transformers' primaries being wired in parallel vs. series?\n\nI will be using an actual 240v outlet so I can skip the jerry-rigged adapter.\nI will be using a fully enclosed box with proper copper connectors and wiring instead of mocked up crimp connectors and wood screws.\nI will be installing an earth ground on the cores of both transformers.\n\nI understand the basics of working with electricity, but I am a little unsure and would like some pointers on making this doable but safer.\nThanks",

At the moment, I am trying to take ADC samples at a rate of 250 Hz using a timer interrupt, but I am not sure if I am setting it up correctly.\nCurrently, this is how I have set up the ADC (ADC1) and the timer (TIM3): ADC: Non-continuous conversion mode, non-scan mode, and external trig conversion set to ADC_EXTERNALTRIGCONV_T3_TRGO. TIM3: MasterOutputTrigger = TI_TRGO_UPDATE MasterSlaveMode = TIM_MASTERSLAVEMODE_DISABLE\nAt the moment, I have it so that I call HAL_ADC_GetValue in the timer interrupt (and I am also transmitting the data over UART - 9600 baud rate), but I am not sure if this is the right way to go about it. I feel like I am setting all this up and then just putting it together wrong. Are there any glaring mistakes with this? Do you have any suggestions for setting a specific sampling frequency?",

There are 16 command inputs that I have measured with a multimeter and oscilloscope, but I am not sure what many of them are for.\n\nI found the signal from the original software that changes when I change the frequency of the mirror, (a sawtooth and an inverse sawtooth), which I am guessing are the - and + differential inputs.  \n\nOther controllers often have command pints for temperature status, servo enable, servo ready, and scanner position, but I am confused about figuring out what the other pins are for.  Does anyone have advice on methods to find out, and control?\n\nDo I need to worry about input impedance or floating grounds, or could I supply a signal with a function generator and power supply and ground them to the case?\n\nI can list the measurements for the 16 pins that I have, both from the pins themselves and from the input signal from the OEM software if that would be helpful for anyone interested in helping.  \nThanks very much for your time",

We have succesfully gotten the GPS to send the information using serial through to our ATMEGA88PA, but when we send it to our LCD we're getting a lot of random characters. It sometimes follows the correct NMEA format and sometimes does not. But it is almost never accurate. We tested the LCD with some test numbers and everything is transmitting to the LCD just fine.

        "text": "For some people, the only kind of internet connection above certain speed they could have is by free space optical data transmission:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication\n\nThey and their software have to live with a connection that does not work in snowstorm or fog. When it does work, the speed could be much higher than most people have, like 100Mbit/s.\n\nIf an internet service provider has a station on a hill with visibility to 100 customers, how to transmit to all with only 1 lens? By having 100 LEDs on the focal plane of the lens, in precise arrangement. How to receive with one lens only? By using a special chip on the focal plane that has millions of pixels, but can use only 100 of them for light detection with 10 nanosecond time resolution. Somehow there needs to be ability to route data only from some pixels, while most pixels are left unused.\n\nA camera could work as a phone without any cellular or internet connection by having an area of pixels above the rectangular picture frame that can use just 1 pixel with microsecond time resolution. Camera has to be pointed roughly on the right direction and hand shaking is compensated by choosing only one pixel from millions. Cameras have fast enough LEDs already. Attach a 200 lumen flash light with a tightly focusing lens ( by USB cable for example ) and you could talk 10 kilometers away with great sound quality. 1000 lumen flash lights are common. Choosing just one color like green, red or near-infrared can make it more efficient.\n\nHow that pixel choosing could work? How much controlling circuitry there needs to be around every pixel?\n",
