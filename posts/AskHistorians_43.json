        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10zyfit/is_the_legacy_of_artemisia_i_of_caria_significant/",
        "text": "I have always enjoyed history since I was young and recently I have gotten interested in ancient history, more specifically: Ancient Greek history. For the past few days, I have been learning about the Greco-Persian wars and the numerous military battles that occurred during this war. My person favourite is the naval Battle of Salamis. Anyway, one of my friends also enjoys Ancient Greek history and actually informed me that a Greek Warrior-Queen named Artemisia I of Caria actually took part in the battle and fought for the Persians against her fellow Greeks. Artemisia is their favourite figure from the Greco-Persian wars. The reason for this is because her legacy is highly significant when we look at what happened historically. \n\nThis is why I am interested in trying to understand why is Artemisia I of Caria so significant when it comes to Ancient Greek (and Persian) history. It also seems to be the case that what we know of her life comes from Herodotus. The passage about her that stuck out the most to me was this one: \n\n“And I say to you this: spare your ships, and do not fight at sea. Their men are as much stronger than your men by sea as men are stronger than women. Why is it so necessary for you to risk everything by fighting at sea? Do you not possess Athens, for which you set out on this march, and do you not have the rest of Hellas? No one stands in your way. Those who opposed you have received what they deserved. I will tell you how I think the affairs of your enemies will turn out: If vou do not hurry to hght at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily accomplish what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes are not able to hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities. I have learned that they have no food on this island, and it is not likely, if you lead your army against the Peloponnese, that those of them who have come from there will sit still, nor will they care to fight at sea for Athens. But if you hurry to fight at sea immediately, I fear that your fleet if reduced to cowardice may also injure your army on land. In addition, my King, take this to heart: Good people's slaves tend to be base, and the slaves of the base tend to be good. You, who are best among men, have base slaves, who are accounted your allies, the Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians and Pamphylians, who are of no use at all.” — Herodotus 8.68 (tr. Godley)\n\nCan the content, context, and meaning of this passage shed any light on why was Artemisia and her actions are so significant? Another further thing that personally interested me is how Herodotus seems to portray her positively considering the fact that he seemed to be very pro-Athenian in his historiography and yet Athens was known for being extremely sexist against women. I wonder if it was because she was from Halicarnassus, just like Herodotus himself.",

        "text": "So the claim goes like this:\n\n\nThe Soviet government was strongly pushing for a second front in Western Europe to divert part of German forces from the East. By mid 1943 they were getting angry that the Western Allies had still not landed in continental Europe, and instead focused on a “side-show” in Africa, which lead to a lot of tension between Soviets and the West. \n\nThis supposedly caused a lot of fear in Britain and America, that the USSR might try to enter peace talks with Germany to either end the war or to establish a ceasefire, with the intention that Germans would focus on the West instead. \n\n\nHow realistic was that? Were there any serious plans in the Soviet Union to enter peace/ceasefire talks with Germany in 1943?",

The reason why I think this would be a good change would be that 10 years is a decade and the base unit of our decimal system and I think it is the best balance between history and current events. For example, I think if we ask the question about whether talking about Obama’s first term is distant enough to get a bigger picture, I would say yes since we are. I think 2013 seems quaint enough to make that determination. If you do not agree with this, I’d appreciate your reasoning.",

Why did Medieval society become more tolerant of aristocrats and monarchs holing up in their castles and denying battle to wait out enemies ravaging their lands, instead of doing like their earlier counterparts did and depose more cautious leaders in favor of more aggressive ones?",

        "text": " Hi everyone,\n\nLet me just start by making it very clear that I am not a holocaust denier. I will not be engaging in debate in the comments with anyone. I am genuinely seeking help to clarify something i'm struggling to find.\n\nI've always been fascinated by WW2 and have lost count of the amount of documentaries and movies watched and the museums I have visited. I very recently embarked on a tour of Auschwitz, which leads me to this post, as I left that grim place with questions I regret not asking when there.\n\nI'll jump to the point. I am searching for material, documentary or photographic proof that there were multiple gas chambers in operation at several camps across Poland and Germany and that they were used to exterminate people on an industrial scale (several thousands, daily, at each camp). I have had no trouble finding plenty of irrefutable evidence that gas vans were used extensively, as well as mass shootings being common and I do not doubt that gas chambers were used, to some extent, to murder prisoners but what I am finding difficult to back up with evidence is that scale of which gas chamber murders were said to have taken place as well as the number of confirmed chambers. It's my understanding that the chamber at Auschwitz is a recreation built by Polish communists after the war, and other remaining chambers are in ruin or were never used.\n\nI'm struggling to find anything other eye witness testimony that confirms this narrative. As I say I havent had an issue finding evidence of gas vans and mass shootings including communications and documentation.",
