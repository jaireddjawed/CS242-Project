        "text": " \n\nHi there,  \n\n\nMy GF and I stumbled across a weird website while looking for car parts, of all things. It started with [this](http://boulderwoodgroup.com/blogs/post/how-much-does-it-cost-to-wrap-a-dodge-charger) website, and things went weird because we noticed the actual article was all over the place (and ALL of the articles are all over. They seem to be copied and pasted from titles of various websites. Which started all of this searching). When clicking home or back it takes us to a different [website](http://heirloommeals.com/), whose author's name we Googled because at that point we were already in too deep. Her name is Carole, who seems to also author [this ](http://boulderwoodgroup.com/)website. We found the authors name, Googled it and came across her Facebook and noticed a post about a new [website](https://www.loveeatheal.com/), where in the about section we saw something that said \"NeuroChangeSolutions Consultant\" which was a red flag for us so we Googled that too. Which brought us to [this ](https://neurochangesolutions.com/)website, talking about a Dr. Joe Dispenza. Then we saw the consultants tab which, to us, screamed MLM of some kind, noting the fact that Carole lists herself as a 'consultant'.   \n\n\nDr. Joe Dispenza sounds, to us, like a scammer. Especially on his [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/@drjoedispenza)channel. Talking about solving neurological conditions with meditation.   \n\n\nWe never actually figured out what was going on with the original website we found. Clicking other links IN the site work, but refreshing or going back take us to the Heirloom Meals site for some reason.   \nWhile we went on a very strange rabbit hole. Please don't contact or harass anyone you might find in these websites. We're not trying to be assholes, mostly just curious about the initial website and providing the larger context for what we found. The initial website is really damn weird, as I said they seem to be copied from article/TikTok titles but the actual post itself is usually very weird like \"HOW TO GET A CHILD SUPPORT WARRANT LIFTED\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUT having said all that the website SEEMS to work fine when using my link to the website itself. When doing a search of \"cost to wrap 2016 dodge charger\" (which was my original search) the website breaks for some reason, and links to Carols website 'Heirloom Meals' when going back or refreshing.  \n\n\nCody &amp; Kendra",

The actual key itself, which can be of different sizes or algorithms (typically RSA or something is used). There is also a comment (which is rarely used), and a User ID. This ID can be something like an email address, phone number or something of the like, and there can be multiple User IDs. These keys get posted on a public key server, one of them being hosted by [MIT](https://pgp.mit.edu).\n\nAs I searched that specific keyserver, I found this [strange key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x923E174D7EEEAAD1&amp;op=index), with fingerprint `0x923E174D7EEEAAD1`.

But these videos aren't trying to educate anyone on any historical information. They're the OCs of operating systems.\n\nRecently I found some odd videos about Windows 7 and stumbled upon an entire series. They claim to be showing the history of them, but they put in random edits of logos and things that don't exist like Windows 99. It's surreal, it has a community, and it has no benefits or reason to exist. At least the real ones tell you the truth, these videos are saying it's real and then inserting their own shit. It's more of a slideshow than a video.\n\nThey have titles like \"Unreleased Versions\" which is apparently their community name, but they were never made in the first place.\n\n[Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPcsap7YDvs). This one is just editing screens of old Windows and putting 7 in them to show the \"history of Windows 7 from 1999-2999999\". What's the point? There was only ever one \"Windows 7\" made, you don't need to make things up to pay tribute to its death in 2020.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/windowsneverreleased/\n\nApparently they have a subreddit too. Basically seems like an odd fixation on computers much like the GoAnimate people or other weird communities. A more fitting comparison would be people that make OCs and pass them off as \"unreleased characters\" I guess. Maybe this is just a sick fetish.\n\nThese guys get thousands of YouTube views somehow, probably from people trying to look up actual information on the Windows operating systems. I mean, they put effort into it. Some of the edits are higher quality than others and these people may have put heart into these screenshots, but I just don't get it.",

        "text": "I'm not exactly sure where to post this, but this subreddit made me want to share about my strange online encounter I had with a couple online. This might be quite a lengthy story, so bear with me here! Also, you all might be able to solve the confusion and enlighten me some. \n\nWell, Tinychat has always been a site I've visited on and off and I started being a member of that site when I was 15, even though I knew the obvious dangers that site could bring to me.\n\nFor those who do not know what Tinychat is, it is basically a site that enables you to chat with multiple people at the same time, but private messaging is also one of the options of each chatroom. You can show yourself on camera which gives you an edge in the room because you'll be easier to remember the next time you visit, regardless of your numerous nickname changes. Apart from just chatting, members of the room can also share videos and music which makes it an even more fun experience for some. \n\nAs expected you'll have your hoards of horny men and women, pedophiles, and dick flashers who will go in a chatroom to try and slide in your private messages in hopes of getting lucky (especially if they find your appearance on camera to be very attractive). \n\nGiven that I'm a girl, situations like that do not come new to me. I always had moderators and room owners who were ready to ban anyways to keep the room clean from all of that stuff. Despite the sex-driven visitors, the site does have welcoming \"regulars\" who have stayed in the same chatrooms in long periods of time. They make the not-so friendly environment an easier place to be. \n\nWith that being said, I overlooked all these hungry predators because it was easy to avoid and get rid of them. Or so I thought.\n\nAfter being a good, loyal member of a chatroom for a good couple of months, school took its toll and I was very busy. By 16, I was out of touch with Tinychat but came back when I was 17 during the Christmas break. \n\nThe first few days of coming back was spent re-introducing myself to people who fail to recognize my face and befriending people I haven't met before. As usual, men PMed me occasionally and I rejected every single one of them the same way I did before. \n\nOne day, I find a PM from a girl with a nickname along the lines of \"isabelsunshine760\" or something like that. She started off the PM saying, \"Hey! You look like a really sweet person.\"\n\nNow, it's rare that I get PMs from girls but she starts off genuinely nice, and so instead of automatically getting her blocked out of suspicion, I thought I should give her some leeway and welcome her to the room as well as make friends with her. \n\nShe starts off complimenting my hair and my \"cute\" face, and although it gave me a weird vibe, I played along and thanked her compliments. \n\nFurther into the conversation, she then says, \"I'm actually on vacation with my boyfriend Mark on Fiji. Can i share you our photos?\" \n\nWell, I don't know. She was starting to give me the creeps but I reconsidered and maybe she just found comfort in me. Thus, I let her share her vacation photos. She sent me numerous links and so I checked them out. \n\nI feared that they were some nudes, but she caught me by surprise by sending me actual vacation photos of herself and her boyfriend that she referred to as \"Mark.\" \n\nShe was a slim, blonde girl, wearing a black bikini on top of the clear waters along with numerous other people who decided to spend their day on that beach. She had a few more shots of herself on the water. \n\n\"Do you like them?\" She would ask from time to time.\n\n I would say, \"Yeah. Looks fun there,\" and she would send me more. She resembled Katy Perry somehow (the Katy Perry without makeup), except she was extremely skinny.\n\nLater on, she reveals Mark's face on the photos as well. He was a nice-looking gentleman with a clean face. He looked sunburnt though. Nevertheless, they looked like they were having the time of their lives at Fiji. The pictures were either on the water, or they were sitting on sand, drinking fruity tropical drinks, and eating good food. \n\nShe then asks if I could accompany her in another chatroom. Mark was apparently waiting there and she said she wanted to make friends with me. Because I didn't really have anything else to do and the main room was dying down, I decided agree to her request (although hesitantly) and to the other chatroom I went.\n\nThere was something fishy about her despite how sweet she was and I wanted to dig in deeper. The only way to quench my thirst for more information about what they are trying to get me to do is to go ahead and dive in. \n\nI enter the chatroom and there was nobody but isabelsunshine760. I ask her where Mark is and apparently Mark has been with her reading our conversations as well. They told me to cam up, promising me they would show themselves as well as send me more photos of their vacation. \n\nI was beginning to get the hunch that they were going to ask me to strip, but nevertheless, I was dumb enough and I turned on my webcam. \n\nThey sent more photos of their vacation but their language started to become a little sexual: \"You're so cute. Mark really thinks you're beautiful. I think you're beautiful too. I wish we could do things altogether.\" \n\nI turned off my webcam and left them. I told them I wasn't into any of it and I'm not going to get dragged into it again. I went back to the main room I initially stayed in and isabelsunshine760 goes back in that main room to try and persuade me to come back in her chatroom. I rejected her request yet she insists in persuading me to \"doing things\" with them. Saying that it is the best thing in the world, and it evokes nothing but the \"enjoyable feeling of wildness and freedom.\" I said no over and over until she let it go and left me alone. \n\nNot so long after that incident, I left Tinychat once again for a month or two and I, once again, came back to the same chatroom I stayed in prior to when I left . \n\nShortly after coming back, some girl sends me a PM again and greets me with about the same line as to what isabelsunshine760 started off with: You look really sweet. \n\nShe then eggs on asking about my name and how her boyfriend (she didn't disclose his name this time) finds me absolutely gorgeous as much as she does. It rang a bell and reminded me of isabelsunshine760, and I was beyond bothered. \n\nI told her, \"I remember you. What the fuck do you want?\" \n\nShe says, \"We remember you too. I'm sorry. You really need to try things out with us.\" \n\nIt was ridiculous how she even pretended like she was meeting me for the first time. She then sent a series of links to photos but this time, these photos were of her and Mark actually having sex with each other. She told me I could join in on the fun and that I was missing out on so many things. I rejected her suggestion and got her banned from the room by one of the mods. \n\nI stayed in the same chatroom in peace for a couple months until I got in a stupid fight with a few mods which got me kicked out of the place. I then transitioned to this new chatroom who welcomed me wholeheartedly.\n\nJust a couple weeks in, I get another PM from a girly nickname telling me that I'm cute and I look really sweet. Again. \n\nThis time, her story was that she was with a girlfriend. No Mark, no boyfriend, no nothing. She pretended to be a different identity except her approach to me was the same as the previous ones that made me realize it was the same person as isabelsunshine760. \n\nI told her I still remember her and she told me I \"looked familiar.\" I got to asking about what the fuck happened to Mark and she got into this whole spiel about how her and Mark met this tipsy Asian girl and visited her in her hotel room and they had an amazing threesome experience, and that like the Asian girl, I could be the next one. \n\nI asked her, \"Why me of all the girls in this fucking site?\"\nand she goes on and on about how cute I was and how they couldn't help themselves.\n\nI was baffled and overwhelmed. I was also scared. I just had to get out of that website. It is so crazy how this same couple has tried to keep in touch with me for the third time. I was confused if she was some kind of bot of some sort because the way she talked seemed to be very set-up and scripted somehow. It was the same approach over and over and the only changes were the contents of her story.\n\nI can still vividly remember the photo of her on that beach at Fiji, surrounded by a bunch of other people going about their vacation with their kids. It's so scary to think that the people we pass by on our day-to-day lives can be a part of some bizarre shit. \n\nSadly I didn't save the links. I'd rather not revisit their pictures! \n",

The other day, $Joe came in and announced that he\n\n&gt; invented the hole in $VideoPortal i owned the company hard i need to contact $VideoPortal ownership to conform the hohole.\n\nThis happens from time to time, though usually with better grammar, and the proposals that these people are posting and usually expecting at least a couple of million dollars for their revolutionary idea go generally in one of the following directions:\n\n&gt; * It will reorganize the website!\n&gt; * It will implement dating features! (seriously, that happened multiple times)\n&gt; * I can't tell you, first I want my million bucks!\n\nThis time though, it was different. \n\n&gt; It's a hole you hafto go around it would make me owner of the new company based off my hole in $VideoPortal desighn.\n\nI still have no idea what he means. Luckily, my co-contributor $OMG! is being honest already after 9 posts back and forth:\n\n&gt; Stop talking nonsense. \n\n$Joe, who uses a different account by now, conters this reply:\n\n&gt; You hafto be white to me you all said so\n\nI try my luck by telling him that if he has a different native language, he may want to try posting in a forum in his language. Nope. \n\n&gt; You hafto go someplace special to enter a $VideoPortal hole design were is that?\n\nNow $Justin, another co-contributor, summarizes again what we already said – maybe it helps? It does. Sort of. He explains that he is an \"eanglish white man\", who is typing on a phone, so he may do some spelling mistakes, and continues to *describe* what a hole (or rather, *his* hole) is. \n\n&gt; I am referring to the hole in $VideoPortal concept crated by the owner of $VideoPortal mabey two years ago were your supposed to videotape a hole in the ground were you hafto explane your $VideoPortal hole design and go around the hole in the ground. This would make me owner of $VideoPortal if you don't know what I'm talking about why not ask the owners of $VideoPortal they know exactly what I'm talking about the hole you go around were you hafto be colurfull and makes you owner of the new company based off my design.\n\nAt this point, we've given up. A $randomuser comes along, asking what kind of drugs $Joe takes and whether he can have some, only to have $Joe further describing his hole. \n\n&gt; $VideoPortal must go to a hell now, ile be the owner of bluetube witch will sell all sorts of $VideoPortal holes like yellow on down and not the blue uptop will all be famous for it.\n\nThe $randomuser feeds $Joe. **It could have been over!** But no. *sigh*\n\nA bullshit conversation emerges between the $randomuser and $Joe, $randomuser obviously enjoying trolling the guy on his phone with his \"tiny teliphone screen and a bad auto corrected that spells hole and $VideoPortal wrong\". I severly doubt that $Joe has auto-correct enabled at all. \n\nLater, we're already on day 7 of this thread, $OMG! comes back in\n\n&gt; Can you explain your nonsense in greater detail?\n\nSurely enough, he does. It apparently is a competition to make a video about the hole to become CEO. Never mind his design proposal from earlier, the very same hole now appears to be something different. $OMG! suspects that this was an E-mail-scam thing? Nope, $Joe is certain that the competition has been open for years and will end in 2016.\n\n$OMG! diggs some more to try to find out where the hell $Joe got his idea with that hole from, and comes to the conclusion\n\n&gt; I guess that hole exists in your mind only.\n\nI'm tempted to mark that as best answer, but eventually decide against it because of SEO reasons. \n\nWe're now over a month into this thread. Another co-contributor, $Woman7 comes in. She tries to find a connection between $Joe's colorful hole and features of $VideoPortal. Surely, she does (she's good in finding connections even if there aren't any), and links the hole to the \"circle\" feature of the social platform of $VideoPortal's parent company $SearchEngine. Nope. That isn't it, and $Joe is still sure that the owners of $VideoPortal will know what he is talking about. \n\n$Randomuser2 comes along and says that if $Joe is planning to make money with a security hole, he better shouldn't as $VideoPortal would probably bring him to Jail. \n\nNow $Woman7 has a genius idea: She asks $Joe to make a video about his hole. There is no auto-correct there, so if he is in fact sane, that should solve it. His response:\n\n&gt; Me, witch is red, and being yellow all around, plus being blue with a frown and being \"not the yellow\" on down witch goes round and round,and now you hafto copy hands!with me! And the network,witch will be blue all around when I invented the hole in the ground that goes round and round;seeing bakwords! Be yellow too because I invented that hole in you.\n\nDo I still need to mention that I still have no idea what he exactly wants?\n\n&gt; Perhaps we should just put some safety tape around the hole, and call the council\n\nsays $shield, another co-contributor. At this point, I believe most of us have found this thread. \n\n$Woman7 apparently can fully understand $Joe. Either that, or she goes all-in on troll-mode. \n\n&gt; Hail to the dangly bits who go around the hole, juvie collapses the hole, punch the hole and around the hole we go. Mine eyes are filled with ice holes, holes on my head, buckets of rays guns coming from red.   \n\n\n*I've skipped an important bit up to now: $Joe has a channel on $VideoPortal. And he created lots of other threads in other sections of the forum, persumably to ensure his hole is seen by the CEO, and in one of them he actually followed $Woman7's advice and posted his channel.*\n\n$shield notices:\n\n&gt; All they appear to be is videos taken by camera of a game playing on a video screen (looks to be a crt).\n\nAfter another couple of posts of $Joe, that basically are just as confusing re-phrases of his posts so far, another nightmare steps in: $bellaIndianguy. He joined us after an announcement that $VideoPortal would fully cover a full trip to $VideoPortal's HQ and back, and promised to answer 50 threads per day. And he actually went for it for a while, the only problem: He has yet to figure out what commas and periods are. the tl;dr of his story is: we went to $VideoPortal's HQ, he did not. \n\nWhen $bellaIndianguy stepped into this thread, he hadn't responded to threads for quite a while, and I hoped I would not see him again, but... *sigh*\n\n&gt; what is the hole hole means  a holde defined 2 things 1 is loophole and i think you know the other one and so for the 2 one i cant help you with but for the first one loophole is bug and that all stuff is not linked to youtube form to make you if its a bug in youtube then for this is the way you need to go use the link below there is all the info apply for it follow all the rules submit your bug report as per the damge that can be recieved by the bug to youtube you can clam your reward from youtube and also as bugfiner you can get more rewareds from bughunters in web \n&gt; [link]\n&gt;this is the link this allow all bug repoets regarding all google products so follow the link and thank you for the help and if you want to know anything else please let me know  and if you think u invented anything submit to google science fair and no one can invent a hole they can jest find or discover so please if you cant speak english use your mother langugue  forms helps us to unterstand us anylangugue \n&gt;\n&gt; thank you \n\nTo which $Joe answered:\n\n&gt; No its not a hole in the code no more its a hole in YouTube hole\n&gt; We're going out hafto pay me for my design. I invented it and its me.\n\nFollowed by the typical nonsense conversation between $Joe and $Woman7. \n\n----\n\n*And if they didn't stop responding, the thread is ongoing to this day.*\n\n----\n\ntl;dr: User keeps talking about his hole, now well over 3 months.

So a few weeks back I was chilling having a couple drinks and feeling a lil randy so I decide to hit up some hook up sites like Adam4Adam, NSA ads on CL that kinda thing cuz as a bi male sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you dont and it had been awhile since I had been with another guy.\n\nSo I finally found a guy on A4A who seemed sane, he sent me a bunch of pics including his face and he was def attractive with a hot body and good sized package. And even though I was def ready to get it on I never, ever,ever, just meet up with a guy w/o getting to know him a bit, talk to him for a couple days/weeks to make sure he is sane before I put myself out there.....however this time I was super horny and dude lived like walking distance from my house (he emailed his address when I asked roughly where he lived because I knew we lived in the same city from his A4A profile) turns out dude lives one block up from me so I was like dope, I do not even have to worry about driving.\n\nI did not tell this dude how close I was to him cuz even though I was gonna roll the dice on meeting up so soon I just felt that info was unnecessary to share but I tell him I am getting ready and I will be over in an hour or so. He is like cool, asks if I drink vodka because apparently thats what he was having but said he would grab a bottle of something else while he was waiting if I wanted....eh vodka was fine I told him not to worry about it.\n\nAaaaaaaaand this is where it gets fuckin weird, I get off the computer go pick out an outfit, finish my drink and hop in the shower. Now mind you I was taking my sweet time cuz I did give myself an hour at least to be there. So about 45 minutes go by and I check my email one last time before I decided I was gonna head out.....thank Cthulu I did. Idk if this guy was just a light weight or he was drunker than he let on at first or whatever but I see I have a bunch of new emails all from him.\n\nIn that short period of time he went from a normal guy just looking to chill and maybe get off to sending me a bunch of typo ridden messages about how ridiculously horny he was and how he loved to be dominated by strong hung black men and finally ended it all by saying how he could not wait to get raped by my big nigger dick......\n\nSooooo yeah I did not end up getting any that night instead I decided to just stay home and finish watching Daredevil. The irl part is the fact I am 100% aware of exactly who this guy is I see him around the neighborhood all the time going on bike rides with who I assume is his wife or very least live in gf and I just laugh to myself at how normal he seems in public but how huge a creep he is online. Every few days he will randomly email me more creepy ass messages to which I never respond but he keeps on anyways. It is like every time he gets drunk now he has to remind me he has violent mandingo fantasies as if one day I will change my mind but uh yeah not going happen Jack.",

I was expecting horrendous, vile comments about things too horrible for imagination to comprehend. Instead, I found a friendly, genuine group of people. Mostly misfits. People just trying to get a laugh in their normally depressing lives. I read stories about how people's lives were saved by this youtuber. I was astounded.

(if you ever wonder where that image came from and where it started there ya go). \n\nThe thread shot up on the boards to epic proportions. Places like cNet, MSNBC, CNN and other major news sites picked the story and posted the image. They hotlinked the image instead of hosting it on there own websites. Well as you can imagine this killed the site and and after repeated attempts at emailing the people who ran these various sites the server admin at the time decided to get even and have a laugh at the same time.\n\nHe changed the file to an image of goatse and told us in the IRC and on the boards he was gonna do it to. So within hours or minutes i dont remember TribalWar Goatse'd over 300k people looking for the story about the devil face on the twin towers.\n\nI have many other storys from the early days of Tribal War to and a few other more notrious sites to.

One night I was reading a book on the couch, while she was tinkering around on the computer, when I hear that classic AIM sound with her saying \"What the fuck?\"  I look over at the screen and see an IM going along the lines of \"Hey babe, wanna fuk?\"  She gives me this creeped out look because she was relatively new to the net at the time, and I just go \"Hey, troll him.\"  So she responds, tamely, just really saying 'hi' and getting all sorts of questions that I'm sure the ladies of the internet know all too well (I spent time trolling as a chick in chatrooms, and seen how some people can be).

We formally became acquainted in a short phase where there was no dedicated MLP discussion on NationStates because of someone (who will appear in chat logs as “Vuh”) started posting really NSFW material.\n\nSo we created an off-site forum where we could share NSFW material and talk about MLP and so on. We also had a chatroom on a site called Chatzy where much fuckery ensued.\n\nOver time, Captain Lackwit and I became pretty heated rivals I guess you might say, due to my inability to not correct obviously wrong statements and his inability to take any form of criticism. This is a guy who has tried to argue with a doctoral student of immunology on the subject of infectious diseases. THAT kind of inability.\n\nRecently, on facebook, he posted a status. This is your taster.\n\n&gt; Man, I hate when people say stuff is weightless in space.\n\nNo it fucking isn't. The mass still exists. The mass does not change because SUDDENLY SPACE. I get it, I get it. Gravity and whatnot- yeah look if I go to a planet with twice the gravity and step on a scale built for earth (That could withstand such gravitational force, and if I could as well), I don't get fatter. The scale will say 600something but that's not because I'm fat. That's because of gravitational pull. I still have all this chubshit mass no matter where I go.\n\nAnd being on a twice as clingy world would do a lot of horrible things to me, not even mentioning the sodafizz top. No, muffintop no longer suffices in that case. It's like shaking a sodabottle and seeing that fizz go straight down. That's what it'd be like. Appearance wise anyway, not literally.\n\nSo no.\n\nShit isn't weightless in space. Stop saying it. You're stupid for saying it. The mass still exists.\n\nAnd for the love of god, Original Series Enterprise! So does the need for some semblance of structural integrity! YEESH!",

By his account, he owned over 3,000 VHS tapes of classic rock concerts and performances ranging from Grateful Dead to Led Zeppelin to Black Sabbath to Cream to Jimi Hendrix to Woodstock to all the other ye olde great standards of the 70s.  He also had shitloads of memorabilia including the ULTRA RARE STAR WARS CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FIRST GENERATION IN HIGH QUALITY, and also collected and traded Pokemon cards, since they were quickly rising in popularity.\n\nI was a dumbass fucking kid in 1996 and tried to get a Nirvana concert from him.  It was the one from where Kurt sang \"Come As You Are\" all fucked-up that ended up on *Live! Tonight! Sold Out!*  He said I had to send him the money first.  Sent $40 to a Glen in Ohio but never received tape one.\n\nSo I decided to make fake screen names as girls, and this was around the time that AOL had keywords and your own space for making web pages, so I'd hunt around for other girls' pictures in teenager chat room profiles and make obnoxious over-the-top gLiTTeRy N aLL CaPz webpages along with photos of stuffed animals and fake jewelry with money thrown around them.  I'd casually pop into the chat rooms where he'd hang out and just talk to myself.  He'd IM me and I'd lead him on into thinking that he was going to get to bang a 15-year-old girl FINALLY when I'd just sign off in his face, never to be seen again.  Repeat this cycle with a completely different set of pictures of a different girl with a new personality on her web page a few weeks later and get his hopes up and down again.  I played the Smart Girl.  i played da dumb valley chick lol  and i played the apathetic girl who just...idk...don't really care, i guess?  Mm-hmm...and I played a horny black chick whose dad worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix, and oh look I live in Ohio where you also live!  Wanna hang out?  :)  Oh, hold on, mom needs the phone, brb.  *Nadia325 has signed off.*\n\nTen years later, I got to wondering just what happened to him and used Google groups to come across some old usenet postings of his, along with other people flaming his shoddy trading practices.  Turns out he's just a sad lonely old man and the collective internet just shrugged and felt sorry for him and walked away, cutting their losses.\n\nThank God we have shit like youtube and eBay and whatnot now so we can enjoy historical media without the haggling and sending and trading back and forth of materials and cash without the risk of getting ripped the fuck off.\n\nAnyway, that was the story of today's AOL loser.  Maybe next time, I'll tell you about an addictive character from the \"Witty\" chat room who later turned out to be [this dude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Ray_Underwood).",

You wanna mess with him and act like we are some lonely hot chick? \"\n  He thinks about it and agrees.\"Yeah why not\".\n\nWell we introduce our selves as some single chick. Friends Dad starts veting this new girl he just met online then proceeds to tell us three teenagers about his apparent \"rock hard\" genitalia in graphic descriptions \n\nThe kid who dad is sending us this vulgar ass shit instantly regrets even going down this road as does other buddy and my self. \n\n We freak out log off and never mention a word of it to anybody or to said kids dad.\n\nScared for life.",

I didn't know what to write about so i decided i would write about how i found this sub. /u/Shizzable good luck ;)",

They don't allow channel advertising, but a lot of the people will still find a way to get people to come to their channels in PMs or fancy talking. People do this all the time in PMs and it's really annoying:\n\n^The ^following ^chat ^is ^partly ^real...\n\n**Thirsty Youtuber (TY):** wats your channel\n\n**Me:** here you go :) *(links channel)* thanks for asking.\n\n**TY:** cool\n\n**TY:** i subscribed *(hoping I'll ask for his channel)*\n\n**TY:** I like your channel\n\n**Me:** *Still no response*\n\n**TY:** *(Probably getting a bit frustrated)* hey i have a channel too *(links channel)*\n\nBefore I get hate for getting annoyed at this, lemme say this: I understand that it's not a big deal and I don't *have to* subscribe to their channel. What I get a bit angry about is how they're trying to be nice, but in all reality all they want is a glorified Sub4Sub exchange (and I **really** hate Sub4Sub between random people). Also at least half the time they don't actually subscribe...\n\nIf some people start coming to this subreddit, I might tell the story of a creepy Youtube partner ;)\n",
