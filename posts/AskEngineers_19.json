        "text": "Context of the class project\n\nCircumference of rotation= 6.28 feet\n800rpm = 83.7fps/57mph\nDistance of acceleration= 4.71 feet/ 75% of total circumference\nTime of acceleration= .05634 seconds\nInitial speed of ball= 0\nFinal speed of ball= 83.7fps/57mph\nWeight of ball= 5oz/142g\n\nIMAGE- https://imgur.com/a/2itHwAL\n\nBlue square=ball container\nGray triangle= feeding mechanism \nBrown circle = ball\nGreen tube=barrel/ball guide\nBlack rectangle= ball launch arm\nRed circle= electric motor\n\nDotted green line= slit for launch arm to complete rotation.\n\n\n\nI'm working on a school engineering project. We are building an automatic ball launcher that sports players can use for practice to get continuous reps in. It will launch the ball from an arm connected to a electric motor. The ball is fed from a basket into the start point of the tube. The ball is guided though a cricular tube that eventually straightens. The machine is designed for baseball catchers to practice catching pitches. Theoretically it could be used in any sports application. All these numbers and evaluations can be changed and adjusted for more or less speed, or type of ball for whatever sport. \n\n The the prototype we are building is much slower/small scale. It's just a proof of concept. I just need to have the mathematical proof to back up the potential capabilities for each sport, or speeds of each ball. What I'm looking for is an equation for me to plug these numbers into. I need to know the required torque needed for the electric motor to be able to accelerate the ball to the required speed. The issue I have, is calculating torque from 0 to the required speed is easy with online calculators, but they don't take into account for the already continuously rotating arms. 0 to 57mph for a baseball at this distance and time of acceleration requires a ton of torque. But if the launch arm has a similar weight of the ball, and is already spinning at 800 rpm with a speed of 57 mph. The kenetic energy of this launch arm is already going to do a lot of the acceleration apon impact of the ball. \n\nI need to know how to calculate the kenetic energy of the arm, how much force of that energy is transferred to the ball on impact, and how much more torque is required from the motor in order to to complete the needed acceleration of to ball to reach the goal speed in the time and distance of acceleration. \n\nWhat kind of equations will I need to use to make these calculations? \n\nThis is purely mathematical, so I'm going to ignore friction, air resistance, and mechanical failure or resistance. Those will be calculated in later on for the project. \n\nI also don't need any assistance in the mechanical side for this project. It is theoretical/ mathematical proof that will be in a portfolio of information to prove the concept. The basics of the machines mechanics are being done by another classmate. The prototype will be done with PVC and pingpong balls traveling at a very low speed to show the basics of the design.",

For a number of reasons I think it will be helpful if I can do a kind of Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation where the protoype is part of a (virtual) larger system that runs in Simulink, forming a closed loop together.\nI am running my motor driver from one of my laptop's cores using TwinCAT 3 and I can now give commands to it and read data from a Simulink model. Said model has to be compiled into C++ code for that, though.\n\nSo the core issue I still see is that in order to have a useful dynamic simulation I have to make sure that the speed of the simulink model execution is synced to that of the hardware system and to real time (aka Wall Clock time). Note that since my servo drive is slow I would actually prefer to run it slower than real time, it just has to be consistent.\nFrom a brief search I've seen that there are (crafty) ways to get Simulink to sync with Wall-Clock time but I'm unsure if this will still work as code integrated into TwinCAT.\n\nIs the whole idea feasible or would I be wasting my time? Has anyone done something like this before?\nThanks for any advice!",

I generally consider myself really experienced and rarely run into a problem I couldn't deal with and met only a few people that have generally greater knowledge (practical). I never been promoted further (only senior technician) at my last job since system was pretty corrupt. I took new job at another city same role molding process technician and workplace was totally different story. \nIn my previous job( we made a windows sealing parts for cars in Cooper Standard) I adjusted parameters and fixed molds everyday. After a while it was like breathing to me, I could map what would happen in my head and really communicate with machine well and my problem solving skills were sharpened. \nOn my new job there was one different thing. Everything was automated. My job was less involved in changing parameters and I couldn't touch the mold (grinding, welding etc) but was as first technician in company expected to learn Kuka and Yaskava robot systems. For me it also came easily and I in a year was able to fix and program new positions, troubleshoot robot hands and work with much sophisticated technology. \nThey finally gave me opportunities to make some changes in process parameters and I did really great at that, impressing some people that worked over 30 years in that company but different country. \nI asked for promotion since I felt I could do much more and my supervisor felt the same way and went to talk to my boss. \nThey agreed that I should be promoted but the rest is a catch. \nThey want to start working as automation specialist as soon as position opens up instead of molding one. I generally did well in automation only because I got good problem solving skills and memory. But I know nothing about electronics, wires etc. \nI don't know how to feel about this. On one hand it's opportunity to learn something new and on the other I feel my true potential lies elsewhere especially since parts are produced in very unique way and injection parameters require really good understanding and I could improve so much more in that area. \nWhat do you guys think, should I speak to them and tell them to reconsider, or switch to autimation. Myself personally is torn between two words now and I cannot ask anybody for advice there since it's all secret still. Thanks for support.",

Instead of directly training a randomly initialized WiFi-based model, we explored rich supervision information to improve both the performance and training efficiency, such as utilizing the CSI phase, adding keypoint detection branch, and transfer learning from an image-based model.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The performance of our work is still limited by the public training data in the field of WiFi-based perception, especially under different layouts. In future work, we also plan to collect multi-layout data and extend our work to predict 3D human body shapes from WiFi signals. We believe that the advanced capability of dense perception could empower the WiFi device as a privacy-friendly, illumination- invariant, and cheap human sensor compared to RGB cameras and Lidars.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I just dumb for not understanding this innovation as **privacy preserving**?

I’m not prospering by any means either, savings are hard despite barely spending money. Taxes and the cost of living are very high here (Toronto). \n\nBut then I convert my salary to USD… and it’s less than what a new grad US based engineer would make. If I spent 5 years in the US instead of in Canada, I might actually be able to afford a Condo in Toronto. \n\nI thought we had it bad in Canada. But then I look at the engineers across the pond in the UK, and it’s pitiful how much they get paid even compared to Canadians let alone the US. \n\nWhy is this the case? Is there anything I can do to combat the problem? \n\nFor reference, I work in MEP (probably part of the problem honestly).",

The \"Product Guide\" is readily available but its crap and doesnt have much info on it.\n\nIve called Arrow (one of the suppliers) and they told me they cant get their hands on the actual data sheet because its guarded by Omnivision's NDA...  so how tf am I supposed to engineer this into other things??  Contacted omnivision, they dont offer engineering support and told me to contact arrow or digikey.  Im spamming Omnivision daily to try and get some more info out of them.\n\nWhat I need to know is what is the max temperature the OVM6948 can handle during soldering?  The reason I asked is that I have ruined a couple of them after applying heat.  Came here to ask the question because I figured if its meant to be soldered then there must be some typical soldering temperatures that sensors of this nature are exposed to.  I would also like to know which portions of the OVM6948-RALA are sensitive to water.  Obviosly if the solder pads got wet during device operation it wouldnt be good, but what about the rest of the chip?",

I have the opportunity to become a senior test engineer with an esteemed robotics company, where I would expect the offer to be around 30% more than what I make now.\n\nI currently work as a software engineer. I've been with the same company for the entirety of my career (4 years) starting as a test engineer and halfway through that transferring to become a software engineer. While retaining my title I just transferred 6 months ago into a new team where I'm finally on the way to learning embedded systems. I work on diagnostics software in C.\n\nI wasn't looking for a new job, this kind of just presented itself and I'm going with the motions. But I feel conflicted. The end goal for me is to grow my skill set to a point where I'm comfortable, then get out of defense. I can recognize that I'm objectively a good test engineer. I know Python, Bash, and (unfortunately) PowerShell well, I've designed test automation suites in Linux and Windows and I know how to test and debug software and hardware. But I don't want to be a test engineer and my software engineering skills specifically working with C could use some work. Hence my current job. I don't think I could confidently get another job in embedded systems at least until I have another year or 2 of experience with the job I'm doing now.\n\nThat being said, robotics is sick, and working at this new place, while it would definitely be more high-pressure, would be insane in the best way possible. I could always do the \"foot in the door\" thing and work my way up from test into software...again. But not sure I want to do that.\n\nThe only other caveat is that my current company has unlimited PTO. Benefits at the new place are still TBD.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it too soon to leave, or should I run with this if I get it? TLDR: I'm comfortable with my current job as a software engineer but conflicted on whether or not to take a new offer",

        "text": "I'm in the Quality area and have used Elsmar sporadically throughout the years.. it has been an awesome resource to see what experts in the field think about certain issues.\n\nI remember noticing a few years back they had closed down and saw it was tied to a lawsuit and pretty much left it at that.  It has been back (presumably under new ownership?) for a few years now.  \n\nI was curious what happened and what sort of lawsuit would threaten what is essentially an open forum of people providing advice (it was essentially a very active subreddit for QA and regulatory folks).  I found a few pages on the matter-- most of which are either taken down, very biased, or say \"I will keep the information I do have secret at this time\".  Oxebridge (the company that sued them and apparently prompted Elsmar supporters to hack into them) has a few posts on the matter that seem very biased (seems to be written without the professionalism one would expect out of the typically humorless \"quality\" professionals lol).  \n\nVery curious if anyone can provide a simplified overview of the dispute!",
