I am the creator of a number of graphic novels, children's books and coloring books. I have also published 12 books by other Indigenous authors (with 27 more, set for release between now and March 2018). You can find me at www.eaglespeaker.com\n\nI am known mostly for: \"UNeducation: A Residential School Graphic Novel\" - the chilling chronicles of my family's exploitation in the mandatory Canadian residential school system (in the USA, they were known as \"boarding schools\"). \nYears ago, UNeducation began as a scrapbook I hand-curated in my basement and lent out to educators. Today, it's in schools, universities, libraries, bookstores, correctional centers, addictions facilities and reconciliation initiatives throughout North America (and beyond). In Canada, UNeducation is a mandatory of part of the curriculum at countless schools and universities. To date, UNeducation has sold over 112,000 copies -- it changed my life. Go here to read some insightful reviews: http://bit.ly/UNeducation-Book. The long awaited \"UNeducation, Vol 2: The Side of Society You Don't See On TV\" is set for release in early 2018.\n\nI am also known for the NAPI series -- both graphic novels and children's books. NAPI is a Blackfoot trickster, a foolish being, a troublemaker -- who teaches us what not to do. NAPI has been used as an educational tool for thousands of years. I have a monthly NAPI children's book series, where I launch two new books each month -- each with their own unique artwork and reading level.\n\nCOOL NAPI FACT -- If you've seen the new WonderWoman movie, there is an Indigenous character in it they call \"The Chief\" (portrayed by Eugene Braverock, we grew up together). If you pay close attention, he never refers to himself as Chief, he calls himself \"NAPI\". Although he never explains how NAPI is, Eugene based his character on my NAPI graphic novel (as well as a real life Blackfoot WW1 war hero named Mike MountainHorse). Eugene and I are now collaborating on turning NAPI into a modern day superhero, as sort of a origin to his movie character. Cross your fingers, his origin story could even end up in WonderWoman 2.",

So far I have conducted the analysis using New Historicism, binary oppositions, and otherness, all of which helped to find threads of paranoia in both plays. My supervisor suggested I take a look at affective turn and theory -- something I had never heard of until two hours ago. There is some material, but I cannot wrap my head around how I could even use it in my analysis...any tip appreciated:)",

        "text": "The central idea of New Criticism is that a work of literature should be assessed on the basis of what it says, and not what the author was trying to say or in what context he was saying it. If I understand correctly, Barthes' \"death of the author\" says the same thing, that we should pay no mind to intent or context and focus solely on the text as it is.\n\n\nPersonally, I think this is wrong. Just like you can't really know what someone's said if you just hear someone utter a phrase and don't know that the context the utterance occurred in or what the person was trying to say, you can't understand a work of literature without knowing the intent of the author, who the author was and the conditions of when/where the work was written. That's not to say that intent and content should override what's actually been said, but it should be accounted for. For instance, Ulysses loses a lot of what makes it special if one isn't familiar with the Odyssey, literary modernism and the culture and goings-on of early 20th century Dublin where James Joyce lived.",

However I read an interpretation which views his character as sympathetic, since his trial is a farce of justice and his \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech seems to implore the audience/reader. I can see the validity in that interpretation, but I get the impression that he was necessarily supposed to be sympathetic, he was supposed to be a pitiful villain, not only greedy, cruel and lecherous, but pathetic as well.\n\n\nNote: I did not read the play in the original English. I can read modern English just fine, but I couldn't understand the way Shakespeare wrote, so I read the work in translation, particularly Germán Carrasco's *El mercader de Venecia de William Shakespeare* (2002), therefore it might be different.",

For example today was the first time I read a story with the mindset that \"Dublin is the main character\", so I viewed the story's characters as representing different internal parts of the human mind. When I read Two Gallants today I thought the following: Lenehan representing conscience, Corley representing \"the lizard brain\", and Lenehan's timid questioning of Corley's vices getting Corley angry to me resembles how when we question deep desires possibly based on irrational thinking, we often stop doing so out of fear, fear of plumbing the depths of our soul. And I was much more bluntly honest with myself the rest of the day, and it felt good.)",

Which of Milton and Shakespeare do you respond to more on an aesthetic level? Is there an argument for one creating a greater number of influences on literary history? Does either have a more interesting / fertile field of study around them? \n\nThis, of course, is entirely subjective, but there are interesting arguments about what constitutes influence, and what qualities we prize in the 'transcendental artist' category. I have mixed views of Milton, and in my younger days would have handed this to Shakespeare without hesitation. For sheer volume and the number of phrases entering the national lexicon of cultural references. \n\nBut Milton is just unlike anyone else. He's the last of the great literary epic writers. The tradition still exists, I know, but he feels like the last of Epic Poetry in capital letters. And some of Milton's poetry is beyond Shakespeare's superb word-craft. And while not rewritten as many times as Shakespeare (in terms of replications / reproductions) the 'fallen angel' story is so heavily tied with Milton's particular telling. His influence is vast, but dispersed into so many thematic and narrative traditions. \n\nAnyway, I think this could be a fun question with there necessary being an obvious answer. Interested to see what you all make of this, even as I fear a landslide for old Bill!\n\n(on phone, apologies for the inevitable typos) ",

From 'What Is Literature (page 1336 of the Norton Anthology of Literary Criticism, if you've got it handy) he refers to the 'literary object'.  He speaks of a 'reciprocal action' between subject and literary object, and I'd like to be sure I'm understanding the terms correctly. I'm imagining the 'literary object' to be the form the work takes, and the subject to be what it is about.  \n\nFor example, Edna St Vincent Millay's poem 'Only Until this Cigarette is Ended' is a literary object in that it is a Petrarchan Sonnet, but its subject is remembering and forgetting a past love. \n\nMany thanks!

I read Kaufmann's translation and, though I can't compare it to the original, felt as though he did it justice. The copy I have has the German original and the translation beside one another. When I was learning latin, I used a copy of The Aenid with a similar method of translation for practice. It's a good way to feel the textures of a language, bolster vocabulary, and understand what liberties translators have taken with the original text. I was wondering, where might I find more books like this? Internet sources suit me just as well. ",

I realized that throughout the *18* years I spent reading books, I've never thought too deeply about anything I read. No '*hmm, the character development in this novel was superb, but it suffers from pacing issues, especially in the first half.*' Sure, there are books I enjoyed more than others, but I can't tell you why I enjoyed them, only that I enjoyed them.\n\nHere's my question. What should I read to be able to organize my thoughts enough to write reviews? Words like '*pacing*,' '*character development*,' and all that reviewer jargon, how can I learn them?\nAlso, how do I become competent at telling if something is good writing?
