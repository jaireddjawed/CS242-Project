But what I'm really asking is, why do some become radicalized and some don't?

        "text": "I'm trying to wrap my head around something, and I thought maybe someone here could help (including with how I'm articulating it).\n\nI have met a lot of young men either in a religious seminary or who are priests. They all have a distinguishable way of carrying themselves - something I would say is an embodied disposition or habitus. Some of them are really good at playing soccer - some having played it passionately since kids - and to me they have the habitus of the field of soccer. Others though, well, aren't as good and are just having fun; still you can almost see the \"priest\" in them, as opposed to the first group.\n\nAnother example is Italians speaking English. I would posit that an Italian who is used to using their hands a lot and making very expressive facial expressions and intonations when they talk, will carry over that type of behavior when they speak English; but the more they are accustomed to the practice, the more they are exposed to the mimesis, the more likely they'll be expressing themselves less like Italians do and more like the people they interact with (overall, with their face, hands, voice).\n\nMy question is if following Bourdieu's Practice Theory, would we have a default schema or habitus that we embody and almost \"fall back on\"? How complete are the systems of structures he describes, and can a habitus be partial? (Hopefully my premise and my question were clear enough.)",

I have been reading on Jacques Ellul's and Kaczynskis' works as of late, and I am deeply interested in some other theorists that may hold similar views or stances about society and how they consider it to be blamed for most current mental illnesses and dissatisfactions in modern society.\n\nI have perused some works by Herbert Marcuse too, which I found interesting, but I was leaning more towards theorists that may elaborate on the necessity to rebel against thecnological or post-industrial society.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Japanese people are not the most welcome to immigrants, so I decided to read more online https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-12-07/immigration-is-a-tough-one-for-japan-to-swallow and asked some friends. What I don't understand is some Japanese are welcome to dating foreigners. How are you going to meet them if they don't come to your country? My friend expressed that dating foreigners can be like a fantasy that does not need to be fulfilled. Another thing is that if the studying abroad is desired, why should other countries allow you to enter if you deny others. I'm not saying all Japanese think this way. If the birth date is declining it is beneficial to have foreigners come to work. I do understand their point of view that they want to preserve their culture and current economy. They aren't ready for mass immigration yet but new policy for high skilled workers may change that. My question is, if they perceive countries like the US as successful multicultural states, why are they still not welcoming as one? ",

But he curiously never gives citation to these claims he counters, and it rings a some kind of \"straw postmodern\" he's tilting at.\n\nI think he very much has in mind some contemporary scholars, like the specter of Foucault or certain modern Marxists, but I think that his book misses the boat on what lots of contemporary scholars are *actually* getting at when they critique modernity. My tentative thesis on Pinker is that he avoids actually naming names because those names are tighter in their scholarship and more specific in their critiques than Pinker is willing or capable of giving them credit for. But my question then still stands: who are the people Steven Pinker thinks his book rebukes?",

(\"Purchasing Power Parity\" It's in the name, stupid!...right?)\n\nSo as an earner of dollars, If bread(note: I know I'm over simplifying right here) is $10.00 per loaf in my country(Country \"A\"), I can buy 1000 loaves of bread with $10,000 dollars. However, If I convert that money to Country B's currency, then buy my loaves of bread there, I can buy exactly 2000 loaves of bread, correct?\n\nHowever, if Country B's Nominal GDP Per capita is $10,000 and their PPP GDP Per Capita is also $10,000, then I can deduce that Country B has equal costs to Country A, but they simply make less money than Country A.(in this scenario, Joe Blow in Country B can still only buy 1000 loaves of bread. Unfortunately, that means he can't buy as many oranges as I can, because he makes less money than me).\n\nSo as a tourist, the places that my dollar will go furthest are places with PPP GDP significantly higher than Nominal GDP, right?\n\nAm I missing something here, or is it that simple?",
