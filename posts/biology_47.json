The animal parent will say ‚Äúlook your friends don‚Äôt know shit this is how it really happens.‚Äù And then the kids will say something like ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶.so you and dad did that?‚Äù And then comes something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not discussing my sex life with my kids‚Äù and then the inevitable ‚Äúewwwweww‚Äù lol ü§£üòùü§£ lol at least that‚Äôs pretty much how it went down for me at like 7.\n\nBut anyway, kids who maybe grew up outside of society. Maybe abandoned by their parents and raised by themselves. Like that movie ‚ÄúWhere the crawdads sing.‚Äù So say that‚Äôs a dude. He‚Äôs making out with his wild abandoned girlfriend who grew up as solitary as him. And as he‚Äôs kissing her and touching her and they‚Äôre making out, he would just naturally know that his hard aroused penis goes inside her?  I mean it makes sense. That there would be this innate understanding and  potent desire just drawing each other towards intercourse. It‚Äôs just something I always questioned because nowadays  who grows up without ever knowing about sex?!",

The webring website could also have a layout displaying the recent posts from all members, and I think we could add categorization by topic like tech, nature, etc. To allow us to create a cool community.\n\nPersonally I like read blog about Tech so if you are interesting show you! If there are at least 3 interested so I will post a link to the github repo where we will build the webring opensource with pretty good feature.",

        "text": "Hi! I'm looking at applying for a master's program for Winter 2023. What are some of the good universities in this field that have applications that are currently open or are yet to open?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently in the final year of a 4-year bachelor's degree and working on a thesis in a plant molecular biology lab. I thoroughly enjoy this field but am afraid that due to 2 COVID years I do not have the experience that this field could provide and hence am looking into a master's program over a direct PhD program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I come from a middle-class Indian family which is why I need either a scholarship or a stipend to put my self through college (have a sister who needs to be taken care of at home so money is kinda tight).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, I guess I need a little help and guidance as to what program could be best suited from people who have gone through this process themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou so much for taking out the time to read and reply!",

It looks like I'll leave with about a 3.6 GPA, but due to life, it's taken me the better part of a decade to get here. I can always review and relearn general text material on my own. My concern is with practical lab techniques.\n\nIn 8 years, I've been to 4 different schools, and taken a couple of years off. I've worked in kitchens through nearly all of it (not covid quarantine times). I found some experience in a chemistry lab that led to my name on 2 publications.  \n\nI've struggled with my mental health throughout all of this time. I recently discovered I had the wrong diagnosis, and the wrong meds Now that I'm on the right drug regimen I'm much more lucid, but I'm worried about how my circumstances will appear on paper.\n\nI'd like to be able to back up my GPA with at least the appearance of familiarity with basic lab protocols. Is that expected for a fresh grad in a lab, or is there a grace period for them to learn the lay of the land?\n\nAm I just overthinking this? \nAny feedback is appreciated.",

        "text": "TL;DR: \nLOOKING FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION why PCR is showing negative but homes are positive. Also Could this be an indicator on who is farther along into the infection (who had it first?) mom showing symptoms for Covid. home tested positive. PCR taken 2 days later with more symptoms, negative. Next day home tested again with symptoms and it was positive again. I had 2 positive PCRs and 1 positive home test. \n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nMORE CONTEXT :3\n\nHello. So I am looking for a pretty scientific answer.\n\nOn Tuesday, i was showing very mild symptoms of Covid (but I was just getting over the flu so I just thought it was some of the leftover symptoms.). I happened to home test and immediately come back positive to my surprise. I ran for a PCR (thought it was supposed to be rapid) while waiting for my doctor to return call. Went to his office and was supposed to do rapid but instead happened to get another PCR. My nostrils could not handle another swab so we skipped rapid, since home test was positive. That same day I had my family test. Mother had mild symptoms and tested positive (but she is also just getting over the flu as was my father who was also negative for Covid ‚Äî- positive Flu A around thanksgiving) ‚Äî- it‚Äôs been awhile but since we have chronic condition the fatigue and cough lasted awhile) . And I tested positive on home test, and two PCRs from that same day. \n\nTwo days later‚Äî- Thursday. Had my mother get a PCR that was needed for work and she was showing more symptoms at this point. We get the results back today (Friday) and it was NEGATIVE. Decided to home test her again and surely enough it‚Äôs positive. \nIf she didn‚Äôt have symptoms I would say false positive but since I‚Äôm positive, and she received an exposure notice that wasn‚Äôt me and she has symptoms the likelihood of 2 false positives is super low. \n\n*** So to the real question. What can cause a negative PCR but multiple positive rapid test that happened before and after the PCR. Can this indicate the timeline of infection somehow?**** wondering who had it first like it‚Äôs some family competition lol\n\nThank you in advance!",

Let's say to homo sapiens (because until recent times there have been only 1 million of them, so we have a maximum number per generation)\n\nI have no idea about mutation rates let alone of mutations that are not destructive. Or how many successful mutations would be necessary to develop a species from a small mammal over those maybe 70000000 years : 7 years average generation = 10 mio generations?\n\nI guess this is explained in biology (not only questioned by creationists) but I did not find numbers. \n\nI am also happy with another example, my question is not specific to the example i ask above.",
