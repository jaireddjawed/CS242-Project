        "text": "So bit of background info, I live in NZ, I’m in my early twenties and live alone for the most part, I also live in a brand new house if that means anything. So basically for just about as long as I can remember I’ve been having strange experiences that I can’t quite explain, mostly sudden intense feelings usually of terror and panic . On the occasion I have seen things to accompany the feelings, never anything particularly concise but always a darker than black shape. A few years ago while stopping to relive myself while driving through an extremely remote part of the country at night I was hit by the feeling, only this time it was different, I heard a voice scream out “GO” at the time I was unsure if it was inside my head or from someone else but regardless of that I got back to my car as quick as I good and floored it much to the distaste of my friend who was riding shotgun. As I drove off I looked into the rear view mirror and saw what looked like figures standing in the road. I asked my friend if he had seen them and he said he hadn’t been paying attention, and I was beginning to think it must’ve been a figment of my imagination until my friend asked why I had yelled at him to go. So at least some of it must’ve been real, because I definitely wasn’t the one who had called out. \nAnyways for a while after that I didn’t see anything else although I still got the feelings semi regularly. Fast forward to this past year and I’ve moved to the other end of the country and live by myself and until this past week I hadn’t seen anything since I’d moved and the sudden feelings seemed to be less frequent. Last weekend however I was lying in bed when suddenly got hit with the feelings of terror I looked up and I saw something dart out of my room and into the living room, I immediately got up and checked one by one that all the doors and windows were locked and they were, when I got to the last window however there was absolute darkness, no light coming from the street or from other houses around me like there should’ve been and then for barely a split second there was what I can only describe as glowing red eyes staring back at me, it then all turned to normal and the usual street lights were back. Obviously fairly shaken I returned to my bed and was awake all night but didn’t see anything else. Just about every night since then I’ve seen a dark figure or sometimes a few of them moving throughout the house, once although I haven’t seen the red eyes again. For the most part I haven’t had any kind of interaction with them nor they with me, other than seeing them move around. They seem to be visible for no longer than 30 seconds and the feelings dissipate fairly quickly after that, they seem to be getting more defined as the week has progressed, no discernible features but definitely human silhouettes. \nSo tonight I saw one tonight in the corner of my room just standing watching me, this time for much longer than 30 seconds but there was no fear or other feelings that accompanied this one, after probably an hour of it apparently coming and going I was hit with the worst bout of sensations I’ve had in year, tears streaming down my face and a gut wrenching feeling of terror. For whatever reason I had a feeling that I had to check the sliding door that leads outside from my room and what I saw is still making my skin crawl, there was at least 5 figures with red eyes staring back at me, I still don’t quite know what to make of it, they didn’t move or try to harm me but the feelings that I had were absolutely terrifying and the worst I’ve ever experienced and have been coming in waves since I saw them, still haven’t mustered the courage to look again. \nSorry for the long post, I don’t really know what I’m looking for out of this but I don’t know what to think about all this or who to tell.",

I would say I have quite good hearing and I am able to distinguish between sounds and I can recognise my mum calling my name even when it may be difficult to do so. I’m not entirely sure what it was but I have an interest in the paranormal and I wonder if this was that. I spend quite a lot of time alone at home but that has been the only unusual experience I’ve had in my house. Thoughts?",

Now I will be up front I don’t know if it’s paranormal but I’m just curious on other’s opinions as I’ve completely stumped a psychiatrist, so over the past month I’ve been seeing shadows form out of my peripheral vision off of objects and once they do it will look like a arm forming and wiggling towards me or it will lock on a object and just enlarge its self off of objects shadows. Something interesting though that I have noticed is it happens primarily and most prominently in my room and it can happen in other places but it’s most noticeable and active there. So my question is do you think this might be a spirit or something similar or just my mind finally bailing out.\nPS: this happened very suddenly and gradually developed to where it is now.",

But whether or not it's because my sleep paralysis has become more frequent and intense or weird stuff in general just happens like thumping under my bed, knocking on my door in the middle of the night, wardrobes opening on their own (even locked ones) and feeling like I'm not alone. It's all probably nothing but one thing that I've noticed the most is that my dogs hate being in my room, especially at night. Yet they have no issue with sleeping in other people's rooms. Whenever they're in my room though they just sit there staring at walls and corners and their ears are normally back like they're scared. Normally I wouldn't think anything of it but it's kinda starting to freak me out lately with how often it's happening. I've always had a feeling that's followed me around my whole life, I was just never able to put my finger on what it was and I thought maybe someone has an answer? \n\nTIA",

        "text": "When  I was around 11-12 years old living in the UK, I went through a period of 4 months, where at night I could never sleep all the way through at  home. No matter how tired I was or what time I went to bed, I would  always wake up around 2-3am. If I slept at my grandmother's house, no  problems at all.\n\nEvery night that I  woke up, it would be silent in the house except for a light tapping  sound coming from the corner of my bedroom, where my wardrobe used to  be. Every night, I would hear this tapping noise and it would keep me from being able to fall back to sleep, in part because I was absolute  pooping my pants.\n\nThe tapping  sound was never continuous, it would tap for different lengths of time  then stop, before continuing again. This counted out my mother's, 'it  must be next door neighbors clock', when I told her all about it.  'Creaking wardrobe doors' and 'just my imagination' were 2 other  explanations that my Mother gave me. Also, I'd use that wardrobe daily,  when getting changed into fresh clothes and nothing seemed out of the  ordinary.\n\nI remember 1 night, I  decided enough was enough. I had spent about an hour lying in bed  listening to the tapping and struggling to sleep. I jumped out of bed  and went over to my wardrobe, grasped both of the handles and flung the  doors open. There was a pause for about 1 minute while I had the handles  in my hands, once again pooping myself. As the doors flung open, a  t-shirt that I'd had on 1 of my hangers hit me in the face and I had a  feeling like something had punched me in the stomach.\n\nI  remember lying on the floor in my room, not sure how long for but it  was like time just jumped forward 3 hours and my parents were getting up  for work. I said nothing and went about my day as if nothing had  happened. That was the last night that I ever woke up in the early hours  of the morning and last time I ever heard that tapping sound.\n\nAs  I've grew older, I've spoken to my Mother about it all and she has told  me many stories about our old house and I have returned the favor with my other experiences. She said that because I was young and got scared  easy, she always tried to find a rational excuse for whatever spooky scenario I ever told her I was in.\n\nAny ideas, explanations?",

The first two sounds were made from a distance but as I stopped to try and listen, it came close and the sound gave chills down my spine.

My dog couldn’t have reached it. Then a few days later, i would hear a slight tapping noise on my window. Like someone was tapping it with their nail. It would always start once the sun went down. Usually around 10 or 11 PM. It would happen for sometimes 10 minutes, then it would stop, then it would continue. It never happened once the sun was up. If I kept myself busy, it wouldn’t happen. But if I were to be laying my bed and not focusing on anything, I would hear it. It happened for a few weeks then stopped completely. A few days after not hearing it, it was around 3,4 or 5 am. I was on my computer and heard 4 knocks on my door or my wall. I couldn’t tell which one. I thought it was my mom since she usually knocks before coming in, but she didn’t come in. I was curious so I opened the door and no one was there, she was still in bed. Should I worry? I feel like it’s such a weird coincidence that a few days after the door bell went off I heard tapping.",

This was the early 90's and Duplo blocks by Lego were very popular for small children. They came in these big buckets, and when you'd play with them you just basically dump the bucket on the floor and build stuff. Sometimes you'd get special blocks that were meant to build animal shapes or cars etc.\n\nI always played with them on the livingroom floor because that's where my parents were watching television. My mother especially was strict about me picking up all the legos back into the bucket after playing so that no one would step on them (ha, tale as old as time it seems). And I always did that.\n\nOne night I had finished picking my legos into the bucket before bedtime. I had gone upstairs to bed, and as I always had trouble sleeping, I laid awake in my bed.  \nI then heard a LOUD crash downstairs and the specific sound of Duplo blocks spreading everywhere on the floor. I realised I had left the bucket in the hallway leading up to the stairs and my father must have tripped over them. I sat up in my bed because I was scared I would get my little ass handed to me for doing that. I stared at the open door of my room intensely.\n\nInstead of either of my parents, what appeared to the doorway was a face floating in the air. I say face, but it was shaped more like one of those floating lights you see when you close your eyes. It looked at me and it spoke: \"My name is Kolina. If you ever make such loud noises again I will come back for you\".\n\nAfter it disappeared I ran to my parents room where my mother was sleeping. I told her about the floating face but she was very unimpressed and just told me to go back to bed. \"Your father just tripped over your stupid legos, he is drunk, go to bed\".\n\nI don't remember anything else from that experience, must have slept.",

There's also been news in the small town of this house about the deaths and I'll try looking them up later but considering the things she's experienced I'll just stick to this one story for now. \n\nSo about 2 years ago in September of 2020 my grandma had a stroke and needed my mom to go up there to help her for a few weeks while we set up the house for her (my grandma hordes a lot). About a week into this 3 week stay at my grandma's I went through a lot of nostalgia as I had lived there till I was 10.\n\nLate into the night I was on the phone it was around 11pm when I had started falling asleep on the phone with someone that doesn't add much to the story, but I had slowly fallen asleep on the phone with them and didn't realize it was I had thought I was talking to them the entire time. As I had been talking I vividly remember the ghost(?) responding to my apology for falling asleep with a subtly sweet and calm tone \"that's okay dear our long talk has been nice.\" As I heard this I jolted awake and looked at the time. It was 2:14 AM. I quickly looked at the call to see if it had ended and it did but at 12 AM. \n\nI had looked around frantically trying to comprehend what had happened and it just felt weird to think that someone had been talking to me for 2 hours and I was concerned someone had entered the house so I got up to look around but nothing, everyone one else had been asleep since around 9pm so I was completely jostled. \n\nLater that same day after I had gone back to sleep I asked everyone about it and no one was awake at the time. After this I went to talk to my grandma about it and her only response was \" Oh you talk to Vivian she was really nice wasn't she? \" After that my grandma started to transition to German due to her stroke, after that I just had it on my mind during that trip wondering what would have caused this and I honestly just want to go back just so see if I could try talking again. I just wanted to say my interesting experience that's all.\n\nTl;Dr Slept talked with a ghost and my grandma apparently knows her very well but couldn't tell me more due to her stroke.",

        "text": "So, I guess it would be nice to start with some context. My parents divorced when I was 12 years old, and we went to live in a small house on a stretch of old county road right across from a horse pasture and an old man's farm. About 2 years go by, and I get old enough to work(at least in my eyes). \n   At 14, I get a job working for the old man. We'll call him farmer E. I worked all summer on Farmer E's farm. My main job was tending to the horses. I got to know each and every horse personally.\n  He had 4 in total. I bathed them, shoed them, mucked their stalls, and took them for a daily ride. This is where the scary part starts. I had never had any paranormal experience on the farm before this happened.\n   One night I was standing in my yard with some friends. One of my friends pointed to a horse across the street. This was odd because Farmer E kept his horses put up at night. This horse was black and frail. From where we were standing, we could tell this horse was sickly. \n  We walked to the edge of the road to get a better view. From the road, we could see the scabs that littered this creature's body. We could see the creature's grotesque ribs poking through its thin, almost transparent skin. This was not Farmer E's horse.\n   It stared at us the entire night. We watched it curiously. Something about it felt wrong. I decided the next day I would ask Farmer E about it. \n    The next day, I arrived to work early. I asked Farmer E about the horse. He seemed totally confused. He said he honestly didn't know about a sick horse. He then explained that his land had many legends. Supposedly, it was skin walker territory. \n  The final part of this story happened the next day. It was an average day of work until I saw the sickly horse inside the feeding pen with the other horses. In the light, you could really make out all the little details. The main detail that stands out now is its cold, dead eyes. This wasn't a horse, but it desperately wanted me to think it was a horse.\n   I quickly ran to get Farmer E. I told him the horse was back. We raced back to the feeding pen only to find the most horrible sight. The horses were dead.\n  Not only were they dead, but they had been devoured. They had massive claw marks running along their entire body. Their throats had been ripped out. Most importantly, all 4 of them were missing their eyes.\n  I saw the horse a lot at night after that. Always standing in the same spot under the tree. Always staring. We moved 2 years later. Farmer E died of a sudden heart attack in the field a year before I moved. To this day, I can't explain what happened, and it really keeps me up at night.",

        "text": "So I am writing this as soon as I woke up from this dream. (My dad has been dead for 13 years and I am just having this dream now) The dream started off with me and my friend visiting the cemetery I was confused but I kept walking past the graves. There was one name I kept looking at but I can’t remember who. So anyways it wasn’t till I looked around till I saw that I was in the cemetery that my dad was buried at. \n\nI kept walking straight after that I couldn’t turn my head or anything I just focused on walking forward.  This happened for a couple seconds I think until we got to my dads grave. There was a picture of me and him I was a baby and he was holding me I actually have that picture on my phone right now. \n\nThe grave had this compartment where you slide it open to put offerings. I opened it and from what I can remember there were a pair of jordan 1s and I remember saying to my friend “my brother must of gotten these haha” but when I turned around she was just like gone. \n\nI turned my head back to his grave and immediately I got put into a broken house and I saw someone shoot him. The thing that confused me tho is that he was in his army uniform. (He was in the army as a cook before he died but he was actually at war in the dream.) (Also one more thing I have been thinking about being a military nurse and I have been for months now and I don’t know if that has like any connection)\n\nI turned my head to a window and it was like he was starring at me. He was just standing still and looking at me. When I got closer I noticed he was shocked and then looked down at my face (he was 6’1 and I am 5’6). He went out to touch my face but this younger guy all of a sudden come in through the window and said “Hey Viv!” (That’s a nickname people called him. Then his friend starred at me looking really confused. That’s when I knew that they could actually see me and I knew that they were both dead. 2 dead people seeing an Alive person what a shocker huh lol. \n\njust have a feeling that this wasn’t just in my head but a feeling that it was a connection but I don’t know at this moment",

To my knowledge off and on for the first six-seven and continuously for the last 17 months and still are. I hear voices that constantly speaking to me in a sentient manner, they change at will, i.e. sounding like a man or woman, as well as fictional characters. They've instructed me to do complex tasks, taking a train to another state, rejoining the military, to get a job and which job I was allowed to have. They can manipulate the nerve endings in my body. Doing so in conjunction with taunts and threats, creating sensations of touch, pain, etc. Being able to simulate the feeling of being shocked, cut, pinched, raped, in various areas of my body. They can create the sensation of smell in my mind, I smell things not present where I am, they force images into my mind constantly and manipulate my dreams, as in my dreams are vivid and complex to the point I'm not properly rested, i wake up tired and in pain. I dream things I never dreamed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I believe it works through radio/microwaves, possibly submitted from a device to satellite than sent out through 5G towers. No one believes me, and people from my old unit, who I know are involved deny it, even though one dropped me hints that it was true. I'm still being tortured/psychologically abused/sexually assaulted to this day. All I'm able to do is resist what they tell me to do and try to spread awareness of it. I don't expect anyone to be able to help or save me through Reddit, it just a means to spread awareness and information. r/Artificial_Telepathy is where I've accumulated all I'm able to find on the subject. Please visit and share the information, join if you like. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I have posted a more concise, and condensed version of this on Reddit, it contained less because I knew less. I'm also under a constant reminder of the threats and consequences I may endure by telling this to people. Please share my story. Please educate yourself on; V2K, Neuroweapons, Microwave Auditory Effect, Voice of God weapon. I am not mentally ill, I have studied mental illness such as schizophrenia and related mental disorders, they do not have what I'm experiencing in the symptoms. I do not do drugs, not even nicotine or alcohol. I do not have any head related trauma nor been to the doctor for such.\n\n\n\n\n\n   I am only trying to tell as many people as possible that this is real, and has been going on for decades. It is hell it is an invisible prison, it's no contact torture and abuse. It is a complete invasion and rape of the mind and body. I believe it's responsible for a lot of the mass tragedies that have happened in the U.S. I'm sure you understand what I mean.

        "text": "I need help. I've been seeing stuff in my house again lately and I want to know if it's spirits again or if I'm just not ok mentally.\n\nFirst off - I live in Poland, not US or UK.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I've connected with two spirits in my house - one had a strong evil presence and the other had a presence of just someone watching me.\n\nBoth of them disappeared after a couple of months which concerned me because I've felt them for 2 years and they left suddenly. Especially that one was a spirit that lived in the previous house that stood in the place of my home.  \nMy point is - I've heard them twice, felt being touched, and felt their presence.Around this Christmas, another weird thing happened. I think it was a couple of days before that I saw it.\n\nI walked from my room to the bathroom after waking up. When I left I looked into my sibling's room and saw through their window that it was sonowing pretty hard. (Our rooms are next to each other and you can see the same thing through the windows normally.) I walked over to my room happy to know that we will get snow for the holidays. I looked into my window and saw no snow. I walked up, peered out and there was no snow anywhere.\n\nOn Christmas Eve (in Poland that's when we celebrate) I was also leaving the bathroom when I saw something weird.   \nAs I was leaving the bathroom and I stretched out my arm to turn the light off and for a split secound when I had my arm up it looked as if there were flames of light coming off of it. In that moment I had to take a stem back - I made the same pose, tried with different lighting and a little different angles but I got nothing.\n\nNow to the part that's starting to conern me - I saw something back to back.  \nYesterday at night (the light was on in the corridor and in the kitchen) around 7pm when I was making food for myself I saw the tail of a cat wiggle by my leg in the corner of my eye. I was on edge (cuz I've been watching ghost hunting stuff) but I felt relieved when it was a cat tail because we have a cat. It was grayish like a shadow and our cat is light gray. I turned around to it to tell her that she scared me but my cat was not next to me, not anywhere in the kitchen and not in the corridor.\n\nLater at night I felt a burning sensation inside my ear for a minute or two. I know it was probably my nerves too but it felt like someone touched the back of my arm.\n\nThis morning I saw the cat in the kitchen again. I was with my dogs and mom when it happened. I was sitting down and right at that time I saw a cat jumping and leeping foward. It was at the height of the counter but it was in front of the fridge, right above my dogs eating and it was just leeping. Gray shadowy cat, thin with pointy ears.\n\nLast thing - I've been also getting uneasy vibes from the same corner of my room where one of the previous two where, not always though and it feels more uneasy.\n\nI don't know if I should be worried or try to contact it or what.  \nIf anyone would tell me about these signs and what to do I would be the most thankful.",

        "text": "At the start I have to say that my first language isnt English, sorry for all mistakes. Ask me in the comments if something is not clear enough. \n\nWhen I was little kiddo I have experienced some weird shit looking from today. I remember few weird situations but cant put them in chronologic even in my mind. First and I think less weird than others is situation when I woke up, sleeping with my mom so you can say I was around 5yo, I saw blac hand slips through doors, like something wanted to open the door, but when I saw it, hand slowly goes back and dissapeard behind the door. It took maybe 3-5 minutes and by this time I was trying to wake up my mom, but she only got up after the whole thing ended. \n\nSecond situation. I was still sleeping with my mom. My bed was right next to the door which was wide open, so I can see corridor, living room and a bit of kitchen. I couldnt sleep that night because everytime I poked my head out of bed and look to the living room I saw this white as snow, 2 meters tall SOMETHING (cause I cant say it was a person, it doesnt look even similiar to something that I know, maybe just white mass), and this whatever had chains in \"hands\" and was rumbling with them all night. I was trying to woke up my mom, but like in earlier story, she didnt get up. I dont remember the rest of that night. \n\nThird story. I was around 12-13yo (Now im 18), I was laying in my room in the night, watching TV. I remember that I sit on the bed, focus on something, and then someone like pull me back over to bed. Also TV turn off in the same moment, I was really scared but nothing else happend that night. \n\nLast story had place around year ago, soo there is a big gap between these situations.\nAll 3 of them was long time ago and for sure I cant remember everything that had place then. I was a child so these situations could be only \"imagination\" of little kiddo. But this one is the scariest thing I ever experienced in my house, and I remember all details. \n\nAs I said earlier it was around year ago. I was laying in my bad at maybe 2am. Doing something on my phone I heard odd sound like something hit the plate. There was plate on my desk but nothing was touching it. I really brushed it off and doing my thing, when maybe after 5 or 10min this sound popped of nowhere again. I put my phone down and was quite for a while to listen for that sound.. nothing but silent. I brushed it off again, but was a bit curious what that was. Still doing my thing, maybe 30min later I heard that one more time. I get out of bed, put the lights on, and start investigating. I checked whole desk, but found nothing. I was a little bit scared at that moment, only by that odd sound. I layed on the bed after found nothing and tried to forget about that, when immedietly heard it again, looked on the desk and saw a dark figure behind it like flying to the door from one side of room. I was in schock, can barely move, then something hit in plate once again and my laptop turned on. I turned on all the lights and sit like that all the rest of that night. Nothing more really happend but that was enough to scared the hell out of me. \n\nI had couple of other short stories in this house, but I told you the scariest ones. Let me know what you think, is this only a string od accidents or maybe something is in the air. \n\nOnce again sorry guys for any mistakes in this post, if you have any questions, ask me in the comment.

        "text": "My mom passed away a little unexpectedly during treatment for an illness, leaving my dad alone in the house feeling numb and going through all the emotions of the grieving process.\n\nConscious of his isolation, we made it a priority to visit fairly often considering the several hours distance, making weekend day trips about monthly for around the first year.\n\nSince my mom's passing there have been five interesting events that are personally significant: a voice heard internally in her words at just the right moment in a family setting, being a prime example. Most likely a psychologist would attribute this to the wonders of the human brain.\n\nOn one particular visit we decided to take dad into town to see buskers performing, as he enjoys music. After this we walked around the brownstones and a few shops near downtown. We got a photo of him standing in the doorstep of his old apartment building. \n\nWe went into an antique store across the street. I asked the clerk if he had a certain brand of pocket knife, the type my grandfather gave me for a gift as a boy.  I couldn't find this one on ebay. My grandfather being a farmer, always had one in his pocket. The clerk did not have that particular brand, but gave me a business card to call and check again if they'd got one later. After some time looking at antiques and reminiscing with dad, we took him to dinner then got some groceries and went back to his house. \n\nThe hardest part was leaving for home, knowing dad would be alone again but at least leaving him with some nice baked goods to heat up in the toaster (comfort foods like mom would have baked).\n\nBefore going, dad said he'd done some cleaning up in the basement and asked, would I like to bring back my old camping backpack?  So back home we went with the backpack. The following day I unpacked it to inventory its contents. The large bottom pouch had the aluminum mess kit and canteen. The main pouch had a rain suit and camp utensils. The bottom metal cage had a rolled up pup tent. I unzipped the four side pouches and reached in. What do you think I pulled out of the last side pouch on my backpack?\n\nIt was my grandfather's gift to me back in the 80's. My pocketknife.",

        "text": "Sorry if this block of text is hard to read as I am not the best when it comes to getting my point across in writing, however here we go.  \nFor these encounters I will need to give some background info about the house I am living in and the layout of the house. I live in a shared house with 9 other people, its a big house having 5 floors that are split into 2 separate apartments and we are all long term friends that live in this house (including my girlfriend). The house layout is as follows (starting from the bottom to the top): A basement with 4 bedrooms and 2 toilet/bathrooms, following up a small staircase (that is not connected to the main stairs) leads into the kitchen and living area for the lower apartment, exiting out of the front door of the lower apartment leads into a small corridor that has the exit to the house and the front door to my apartment (upper apartment), following through the front door of my apartment leads to the main staircase of the house that leads all the way up to my room at the top floor (the stairs are set out in blocks of 10 - 12 that double back on each other kinda in a spiral), going up the first block of stairs leads to 1 bedroom and a toilet/bathroom, following up the stairs again leads to our kitchen and living area, following up the next block of stairs leads to another bedroom and toilet / bathroom and finally following up the final block of stairs leads to 3 bedrooms on the top floor.  \n\n\n**1st Encounter**   \nFor context my girlfriend lives in the downstairs apartment and has a bedroom in the basement. We where all in the lower apartment just chilling out and having a few drinks and watching some movies (this was back in like 2021/22). It started to get extremely late and me and my girlfriend where getting tired so we said goodnight and headed to her room in the basement and fell asleep. When I woke up the next day my friend who lives on the floor underneath me asked what I was doing last night just standing on the stairs looking at him, I asked him what he was talking about as I was super confused and he explained that when he had gone to bed around 3-4am he walked up the stairs that led to his room and said I was just stood motionless on the stairs in my boxers just looking at him, he said he thought nothing of it as he thought I was just going to the toilet or something (which is next to his room) and he gave me a nod and went to bed. I explained to him that I stayed in my girlfriends room all night and even woke up there in the morning and that I had not went all the way up to my room for anything that night, furthermore in order for me to exit the lower apartment and walk up to my room I would have had to walk past everyone that was still up chilling in the living area (which did not happen), not only that hypothetically even if I was a ninja while sleepwalking I do not have a house key for the lower apartment so for me to get back into my girlfriends room I would have to get someone to open the door for me **(AND I DONT SLEEP WALK!).** After all of this we just chalked it up to him being tired and seeing something that wasn't there however that does not sit right with me and him still to this day.  \n\n\n**2nd Encounter**  \nThis encounter happened a few months after the 1st encounter. My girlfriend was in the lower apartment living area just chilling out on her phone at 1am, she did this because I play in video game communities that do their events in a different time zone and she would go downstairs as to not disturb what I was doing. during this time she fell asleep on the sofa and after my event (around 3:30 - 4am) I headed downstairs to go and see her (she had propped her apartment door open so I could come down whenever I was finished) and she wasn't on the sofa, I assumed she got tired and had gone to bed so I go downstairs to her bedroom where I find her sleeping in bed, she wakes up from her sleep when I enter the room and after a few minutes she thanked me for coming down and taking her to bed. I explain that I had never come down during my event and I didn't take her to bed and that me being in the room now was the first time I had come down. She looked confused and explained to me that apparently she had fell asleep on the sofa and I had woken her up and told her 'you cant sleep down here, you should go to bed' and then took her downstairs to her bed and put her to sleep, I asked her if I had just left after that and she said she didn't know as she fell asleep very fast after getting into bed. I then told her the story of the first encounter because I was spooked and lets just say we both got royally spooked together but just kinda put it to the back of our minds and forgot about it.  \n\n\nThe reason I am posting this and remembering these encounters now is because I recently learned about doppelgängers or people that look and try to act like you and it gives me goosebumps. I asked my girlfriend about what she thinks about everything today when I told her I was going to make a reddit post and she said she didn't know, I told her to ask her mom (my girlfriends mom is religious) and my girlfriend said her mom told her about Jinn (a spirit acknowledged in Islam) which can take the form of a human. Honestly i have no idea what this could be and it baffles me every time I think about it so any help or answers would be greatly appreciated.  \nThanks All.  \np.s. I have other weird shit that happens in the house but its small stuff like lights turning off etc, if people would want to hear about it ill make another post.",

My house was just blessed like last week and this house was built just two years ago, only owned by us. Note I do have two cats that do roam around at night, two Huskies sleep in the heated garage. The reason we had the house blessed was because my wife had an absolute nightmare where we had put our kids to bed and my 2 year old daughter was apparently levitating and she had a ping force stop her from going into the room in the dream. She didn’t say much else and had a really bad feeling so that’s when we called the priest.\n\nAm I over analyzing?? Just genuinely concerned for my kids. Haven’t told my wife about my recent suspicions as worried it may escalate the activity\n\nAm I over analyzing??",

I was dating this girl at the time who was staying in Fields Landing. It’s a very rural area about 30 minutes from Eureka CA. The people that live here are mainly dairy farmers or own horses/donkeys. Her bedroom had this epic view of the green fields that would go for miles. It was about midnight and we were up watching a movie about to go to bed. It’s pitch dark outside. Suddenly, this really bright sun looking figure warps in the fields. It literally lit up the fields as if it was daytime. It lasted maybe 5 seconds and then disappeared. We sat there so confused for a good 10 minutes. \n\nWe thought the next day we would read about it in the local media outlets, social media and etc. nope. Nothing. As if we were the only ones to witness it. I tried to rationalize it. Apparently when a meteor enters earth’s atmosphere it makes a bright light that could imitate sunlight. But I watched many videos of this and it didn’t look like what we saw. What I saw didn’t shoot across the field. It didn’t shoot across the sky. It was stationary. So my guess is maybe a UFO? Not sure till this day. \n\nThis imagine will live in my head until I die. Some things can’t be explained.",

I'd pet and cuddle him.\n\nOnce, I even had a nightmare about something that did not feel safe at all and even though I did not see him, I heard one guarding bark from him that woke me up from the nightmare. It might be crazy but I always thought that was him protecting me from evil?\n\nAnyways, a few months ago I randomly had this dream where I started crying saying my dog was dead (he was not present in this dream either) and after that I never saw him again. \n\nI've had some strange experiences that made me believe there is more after death than just a blank, but I try to stay objective about it. Somewhere I guess I could explain it as in: Me finally having processed a loss, but it all felt too real and I am wondering if it could be his spirit visiting me before he moved on to (idk) a new life or something? \n\nWhat do you guys think? Could it really have been my dog or am I highly overthinking this all?",

I've seen them maybe once or twice play with them and even then, it never fell or anything. Today while all four of us are laying in bed, it falls out of nowhere. About 15-20 minutes I get up and go to put it back up but it's broken. I don't know why it fell or how but I wonder if it was a spirit or ghost or something because before it fell sometimes I'd think I see something peaking around the corner but I always blamed it on the skeleton hanging.\n\n\n\n*Posted in creepyencounters too because I forgot about this one lol.",

        "text": "My (33F) husband (30M) and I live in a beautifully restored 100 year old craftsman home in the oldest neighborhood of Houston, TX.  We have lived here for about 3 years and in this time have experienced odd occurrences that we are unable to explain (list below).  Until today, we would joke that it must be a ghost but never really believed it, but now I'm not so sure.  What do you guys think? Is there a way we can test the energy of our home or something? I feel silly asking that, but what should we do??\n\n1. About 2 months after moving into the house I was in our upstairs guest room and our large (7ft tall, heavy wooden frame - maybe 75ish lbs) mirror which was securely leaning on the wall fell on top of me and pinned me against the bed.  Thank goodness my husband was home to help me get out from under it.  I wasn't hurt, but really confused as I was just walking by and in the past when I've un-leaned it, it took a lot of muscle. \n\n2. On two occasions with different guests staying in the same guest room as the mirror from #1 (maybe 9ish months apart) have told me while they were wide awake they felt like someone sat on the bed/the cat jumped on the bed, only to realize they were alone in the room.\n\n3. While I was outside gardening this past fall, I felt someone firmly push my back which caused me to stumble.  I was certain as I was turning around there was going to be someone there, but I was alone.  My husband thinks I simply lost my balance but I very clearly felt something touch my back.  I didn't bump into anything, it was clear behind me.\n\n4.  This brings us to today, which for me is the hardest to ignore.  This morning around 7AM I heard two thuds about 10 minutes apart.  After the second thud I got up (to let my dog out since they also woke him) and while he was outside I investigated the sound.  The cat was in our bedroom asleep with my husband, and there wasn't anyone else in the house.  I briefly looked around downstairs and didn't see anything, so I assumed it must have been something outside, got my dog, and went back to sleep.  Fast forward to around 7PM, I went upstairs to get my stepson's (10M) bedroom ready for his arrival (his dad was picking him up, he is with us every other weekend) and I found 3 of his books had fallen off of his bookshelf.  I believe this was the series of thuds I heard this morning.  Here are some things that make it extra peculiar...(A) The books were a series of 4, I had organized them in order when I placed them 2 weeks ago, books 1,2, and 4 had fallen and the third book remained perfectly in-tact and erect on the bookshelf.  (B) They fell in at least 2 series minutes apart, not all at once.  (C) They fell pretty far out from the bookshelf, as a former physics major I am certain it would have taken quite a bit of force to get them to land as far away as they did, and nothing had fallen behind where they were on the shelf that could have knocked them.  (D) For those who are curious, the bookshelf is securely anchored to the wall and has many books and nik-nacks that did not appear to be moved.  The books also have about an inch of clearance between them and the edge of the shelf.\n\nThis is strange right??",

        "text": "When I was about 5 or 6, my mother worked at a nursing home called the Brian Center. I would often be picked up by her after school and taken to go sit in the employee break room until she got off her shift. It was in a corner of the basement. For reference, the building is built into the side of a hill, it had 2 or 3 stories but by the time you got to the street, you could only see the second or third floor at ground level. My Mom worked down there in the invalid ward, people who were permanently bed bound, and incidentally the building used to be the county hospital and the basement was originally the morgue. Now my Mom saw a lot of strange shit while she was there, including a dark man wearing a hat that had a dog with red eyes, and a patient being thrown around by an unseen force despite being paralyzed by a stroke, while screaming about she had made a deal with the devil and he was there to take her soul, and the elevators randomly changing floors and opening and the sound of footsteps coming down the hall, but no one was there.\n\nMy story, however, is about me. Just across from the parking lot door, and the corner where the break room was located, was a security desk built into the opposite corner where the two halls met. The security guard was my buddy. He was a black guy who would listen to me prattle on and ask me about what I was watching on the break room TV. He would give me quarters for the vending machine to go get snacks when I was hungry. My Mom was pretty broke at the time and school lunch had been a long time ago, and I had longer still till dinner at 7, so my security guard buddy was the shit. \n\nHe went off on rounds every like hour or so, and sometimes my Mom would pop into the break room and ask if I was alright. She'd ask me where I got the honey but from, and I told her the security guard gave me a quarter. She'd give me a weird look, but I figured she was just having a stranger danger moment being Gen X.\n\nFast forward years later, my Mom just had a knee replacement and at the same time, I caught pertussis while pregnant. So we're both laying in bed binging on Netflix, and I go to ask her, hey, what was that dude's name, the security guard who used to buy me all those honey buns? Remember? That skinny black dude. \n\nAnd my Mom told me that not only did they not have a security guard at the time at all, but that also at the time the only black employees were female nurses.  \n\nNever been able to figure it out. I would say it's a false memory, but how did I get the money? Any ideas?",

        "text": "I lived in my childhood home from when I was a baby until 13. My family is very religious, and as a child I was taught that when you die you either go to heaven or hell and that’s it. I was never told about anything supernatural so in a lot of these moments, I had no idea what I was experiencing. It wasn’t until I was older that I understood. Also because I was so young for some of these or I didn’t understand in the moment, I only remember some details. Last story is probably the scariest and I tear up every time I talk about it. \n\nI wanted to do this in chronological order but I honestly can’t remember which of these happened first, so I’ll kind of combine them because they involve the same entity? In elementary school, I walked home from school everyday since it was only about a 15 minute walk. The house next door to us was abandoned for quite a few years after the last neighbors moved out, and I walked past it everyday. Pretty frequently, I would see this girl in the top floor window and she looked to be around the same age as me, maybe a little older. Curly dirty blond hair, pink bow in her hair, wearing a pink and white frilly dress. I never really though much about her and just went home. There was one time though that made me really confused. I was with my sister in her room playing with barbies. She had a shuttered window in her room that faced the back yard. We were playing and I’m really not sure why, but I had the strongest feeling that I needed to open the window, so I did. The girl was in our backyard standing in front of the slide. I wasn’t scared and was just staring at her. She continued to stand there and I’m not sure how long we were looking at eachother, but she eventually began to fade away? The best way I can describe it is like when you stare at a light bulb and look away and you can still see the outline. It was kind of like that until she was just gone. It sounds stupid now, because if I saw that now, I would freak out, but after she was gone I just kept playing with my sister like nothing happened. I would see this girl pretty often but she never scared me. \n\nThis one is short, but it was the middle of the night and I was asleep. I was maybe 5 or 6. I was suddenly woken up to a hard punch to the stomach. After recovering and calming down, I went to my parents room and they told me it was nerves. So I believed them. \n\nI absolutely hated my parents room. The feeling and energy in there was so heavy and dark. The feeling of panic would wash over me every time I was in there. On multiple occasions I would see things in there when walking to and from my room. The scariest entity I ever saw was standing the right of their bed. It had skin that looked like tar and it was taller than the ceiling so it had to bend to fit in the room. I don’t remember if it had a face. I eventually stopped looking in their room entirely. I hated when my parents would ask me to grab something for them in their room. I would sprint out every time.\n\nOne time I had walked home from school, and it was very hot. So when I got home I threw my hair up into a pony tail to cool off. I walked into my room, and I immediately feel fingers grip my ponytail and start pulling me back to my parents room. (Context: all of our bedrooms were in the same hallway and mine was directly across from my parents room. My dad and I rough housed a lot and my parents knew I was terrified of their room) It didn’t hurt and I thought it was my dad messing around, and he’s a big guy, so I went to elbow him in the stomach and hit nothing. Confused, I looked down and saw no feet behind me. Just as the panic started to hit, it dropped me right in front of my parents door. I whipped my head around to see what it was, and nothing. I sat in shock for a few moments before the tears started to fall. I eventually got up and found my dad talking to my grandma in the living room. \n\nThis one happened about a week before we moved out. It was only me and my grandma home. My mom took my sister to practice and my dad was out grabbing dinner. I was in the living room doing my homework on the couch. My grandma was watching tv in her room, which was to the left of me. The kitchen/dining room and the hallway with all of our bedrooms was to the right of me. The hallway is out of sight from the living room since it goes behind the dining room. I was focused on my homework when I started to hear footsteps going up and down the hallway and into bedrooms. I thought it was my sister wearing her Disney Princess costume heels. The footsteps kept going for awhile, and then I realized my sister wasn’t home, and it was just me and my grandma and she was on the opposite end of the house. My cat was by my feet. My heart sunk once I realized what it was but I decided to just ignore it and not give it any attention. It eventually stopped so I felt more relaxed. After a few minutes of quiet, I heard the loudest slam I have ever heard coming from a few feet away in the dining room. It sounded like someone picked up a boulder and slammed it on the hardwood. I was looking on the ground for what might have fallen, when I heard it speak. It was multiple voices hissing and groaning my name all at once. It was the scariest thing I have ever experienced and currently have full body chills just remembering what it sounded like. I sat in silence with tears rolling down my face, frozen in place for what felt like forever. I was too terrified to move or make a sound. I finally managed to squeak out a little “grandma” and nothing happened, so I started to sob calling for her. We moved out later that week, and the first night at the new house I had a dream. I was standing in the street outside the old house at night. It was quiet and all the lights were off. Then all of a sudden, all of the windows opened and it was so bright inside, it looked like a light house. It sounded like a party was happening, multiple conversations going on and you can see shapes of people moving around the house manipulating the light. And just as quickly as it started, it stopped. The windows all slammed shut, everything was quiet and dark again. Then I woke up. I haven’t experienced anything close to this since moving. A few years ago, the current owners of the house invited my family over for a Super Bowl party. I decided not to go, but my sister did. She talked to the owners and asked them if they ever experience anything weird since moving in. They were shocked she asked and apparently they were seeing shadow people in and around the house looking in the windows. \n\nI hope you enjoyed reading. Sorry it’s all over the place, it’s hard to summarize 13 years :/ These are some of the more scary things I can recall. If anything doesn’t make sense and you want more clarification or have any questions let me know, and I’ll do my best to answer.",

However, my family and friends have been telling me otherwise, and I recently went to the doctor who confirmed that I am actually obese.\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but I believe that there is a paranormal explanation for my weight gain. I have a scale at home that I use to monitor my weight, and I've noticed that it always shows a higher number than I expect. I believe that there is a ghost or some sort of entity that is tinkering with my scale to make me believe that I'm overweight when I'm actually skinny.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous, but I can't explain why I can't lose weight, and I refuse to believe that I'm actually overweight. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any advice on how to deal with this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

He wasn't lucid at all and couldn't really understand much of what was going on or what people were saying. I was home alone, and yesterday, he passed and the funeral guys took him, we planned on cremating him and, yesterday when I finally fell asleep at 4 am, I had a terrible night terror, something I haven't had in years. However this was nothing like I ever experienced. I kept having false awakenings, atleast 20 times in that dream. Each one involving my father and his spirit interacting with us. I woke up with only an hour of sleep, terrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got two texts at the same time shortly before waking up, one from my brother and one from my mother. Just saying \"Yes\". Do keep in mind I always kept my phone on mute, and it wasn't a  delay or anything since I was calling and texting a friend before sleeping, we were up most the night together since she has lawschool and I don't get to speak to her often. I don't know if this was at all related but it can't be a coincidence. I knew something was going on, I was no stranger to the paranormal, but nothing like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I went outside my bedroom, and I asked if it was him, if he could give me a sign. I heard something shift in the living room and I knew- The temperature was abnormally cold. I went into his bedroom and the closet light I left on was turned off. I asked for a sign after turning it back on and I heard a few taps. I began to get a little spooked out. I went into the bathroom and asked for another- The light turned on and began to flicker. At this point I was scared out of my mind, I couldn't stop shaking. I had a cigarette, tried to call my brother. He didn't believe me, and ended the call to go back to sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called an old friend I haven't spoken to in a while, he was pretty much the biggest expert on these things that I ever knew. He got out of bed and got onto Discord with me, which I webcammed as well just incase. We decided to do a lesser banishment along with some latin prayers. When doing so in his room the already cold temperature dropped even further, I was shaking uncontrollably. He tried to stop me or I guess interfere by moving things and grabbing a running cable from under the door, and I knew I wasn't going crazy, my friend saw it too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe messed with random things such as closing a cabinet I had opened for tape for a cross(I'll get into that in a second) and just moving random things to make noise, blowing out an incense stick I lit (and in all my experience with incense sticks I never once had them just go out, especially after quite a bit of the stick had already burned). It didn't work so we went with something a little stronger in terms of exorcism. My family isn't really religious, much less believe in the paranormal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had no bible, no cross. I made a makeshift one and got a gatorade bottle, cleaned it out, put in some water, some salt (I didn't think table salt would work honestly) and began a prayer to bless it, thanks to the guidance of my old friend. I went into every room besides one I ended up forgetting. Splashing it and starting prayers in hopes that he may find peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI of course, told him I forgave him for everything he has done. After all of that he ended up calming down I think, the atmosphere just seemed.. Lighter.. I opened the windows, got some light in as the sun was rising at this point. I think he's still lingering for a bit but, he's not being hostile anymore. I told him I'd take care of the kids and his little chihuahua Ginger. I just hope he finds peace.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was honestly one of the scariest nights I have ever had, and I didn't expect it at all. I mean, a spirit of a man who passed not even a day ago, able to move things, turn things on and off- He was already pretty intune with spirits in terms of animals, but was it because of anger? I felt like he was going through the stages of grief since he was unable to do so before his death. But christ almighty.. I'm still processing that all this happened not even a few hours ago. I actually just, kinda realized this- but my siberian husky, Rose. I think I know why she was acting the way she was all night. I'm just hoping it's over now and he can rest in peace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add to all this I hope the submission is okay, I've never posted here and I just read the rules. I'm grateful for my old friend who went out of his way to help me despite going through some things himself. I wouldn't have been able to doit without him.",

I was having trouble sleeping and I went to look out my window cause seeing the animals that ran around by my house always helped. He was standing across the street, about 6-7ft tall, standing and staring right across from my bedroom window. Soon after I started seeing him a lot more and it stopped bothering me. I stopped noticing him around as much as I got older, until I moved in with my (now) husband. He told me around the same time he saw ‘The Black Hat Man’ standing in the alleyway across from his back door, every night around 11pm-1 am. We started talking about it and thought it was weird we had both been experiencing this when we were younger and shrugged it off. Around 3 months later we both started seeing him in the alley way, always standing, always watching, but he never moved closer. One night after we moved we went to one of my favorite parks late at night, walking around and just enjoying the area. We started talking about our paranormal experiences and he came up, the moment he was mentioned we started feeling like we were being watched. We ignored it for a few minutes as we got back in our truck, only for the feeling to get worse, like we were being told to leave. We started the truck and booked it out of the park and headed home, freaking out. Once we got home we talked over what had just happened and calmed down, blaming it on anxiety. We went to bed and hadn’t noticed anything until 2 weeks later my husband wakes up in middles of the night and swears he sees the man at the window, standing far enough away for his face to not be seen but for us to know he was there, watching us.  My husband woke me up and we stayed up for a little bit and soon went to sleep again. Over the next few nights we had been waking up late into the night and seeing him standing at the window once again. This happened for 2 weeks before we left the house we were at and moved into the place we live in now. We hadn’t experienced anything for a month except for what we think is my great grandmother waiting for my great grandfather to join her. We weren’t scared, everything was peaceful. A week ago I started having nightmares every time I closed my eyes, every time he would get closer, I saw something new every night. He looked like he stood about 6’2-6’5 and dressed like he was from the 1930’s. He always had a black flat brim fedora and a black trench coat, at least that’s how it looked. However, 3 nights ago in my dream he got close enough to were I could see him smiling, it looked like a normal smile anyone would wear except, I gave me an immediate feeling of dread. After I saw the smile in my dream my husband woke me up, making sure I was okay because he could tell I wasn’t having a good dream. The night after the same thing happened , and then last night he got closer, I saw his whole face, he had dark eyes matched with that smile, he put his hand on my shoulder, thinking I would see some skin I looked and there was nothing, just a black silhouette of a hand. My husband woke me up again, and wrapped his arms around me. After my husband woke me up I hadn’t seen him in my dreams, but I have the same feeling of dread no matter what I do today. I don’t know if I’m just imagining this or not. Has anyone else had an experience like this?\n\nI’ve never had sleep paralysis or hallucinations growing up, at least I know I’ve never had sleep paralysis.",

Connie with blonde hair and a green sweater, and Johnny brown hair and a red turtle neck. They were a little bit older than me and I remember feeling very safe and comfortable whenever they came to play. I can vividly remember being at my grandmother’s house in Malden Massachusetts, an old two family where we were having dinner, about six of us. There wasn’t enough room at the table for me to pull up two chairs for them so they sat in the corner while we ate. I felt bad like I was making them watch us eat while they couldn’t. And they never came back around after that. My parents asked me multiple time where Connie and Johnny were and still bring it to to this day. We’re they ever there at all? Or is a child’s imagination so grand it can muster up faces and memories of people whom never existed.",

It was like something was watching me, but when I looked around my room, there was nothing there. I didn't think too much of it at first, but as the day went on, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.\n\nTuesday\n\nLast night was even worse. I woke up in the middle of the night to see a strange light outside my window. At first, I thought it was just a car passing by, but the light was too bright and too close. I got up to investigate, but by the time I got to the window, it was gone. I don't know what it was, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out.\n\nWednesday\n\nI don't know if I'm going crazy, but I could have sworn that I saw a figure standing in my backyard last night. It was tall and thin, with long arms and legs, and its skin looked almost gray. I wanted to investigate, but I was too scared to move. I just sat there, frozen, until it disappeared.\n\nThursday\n\nI haven't been sleeping well at all. Every time I close my eyes, I can't help but feel like something is watching me. I keep seeing strange lights and figures everywhere I go, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do.\n\nFriday\n\nI finally went to see a therapist today, and I told her everything that's been happening. She didn't seem to believe me at first, but then she asked if I had ever considered the possibility that I was being visited by aliens. I laughed it off at first, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. What else could explain everything that's been happening?\n\nSaturday\n\nLast night, I finally saw them up close. I was lying in bed, and suddenly, my room was filled with a blinding light. I tried to move, but I was paralyzed. That's when I saw them. They were tall and thin, with gray skin and huge, black eyes. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't even move my mouth. They just stood there, staring at me, until the light disappeared and they were gone.\n\nSunday\n\nI don't know what to do now. I'm terrified of what might happen next. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't stop thinking about what I saw. I don't know how to explain it to anyone without sounding crazy, but I know what I saw was real. I just hope they don't come back.",

We have a roommate that stays in an area that is separated from us with blankets hung from the ceiling. So basically our place is one large room and one small room that's the bathroom/storage room. The large room we stay in is an L shaped room partitioned off into 3 areas one is our roomies area, ours and then the kitchen type area. We were in our little area chilling, he was asleep in his area and the kitchen area had the only light in the house on. Where the light is located so if something were to walk between us and the light it will cast a very defined shadow directly on the blankets we have as a partition. \n    I noticed it first just a shadow in the shape of a person slowly walk from left to right and then about 30 seconds later it go from right to left straight for where our roommate was asleep. I looked at my husband, tapped his leg \"did you see that?\" I whispered.\n    \"Ya, ummm, human shaped! But where's Dude (our cat)? That could have been him going over the couch.\"\n    \"I don't think so that didn't limp like Dude!\" Dude has 3 legs so his walk is very noticable in the shadows. \"Plus there was no sounds of steps or clawing onto the couch. Dudes not graceful!\" Just asi finished that sentence a full human shaped shadow just slowly started forming making the shadow look clearer and darker. You could literally see the head, torso and arms slightly away from the body as if a person was standing right there and then as our eyes went to the floor we could see what appeared to be two shadow legs at the bottom completely black no defined separation of like pant leg to boots. And with that my husband and I started yelling to our roommate \"Hey Randy! Wake up! Is anyone out there with you?!\"\n    Only Dude but he's on my bed why?\" \nSo we told him what we saw. His response\"Yip I know the unfamiliar spirit!! And that was it. Nothing else happened the rest of the night. I just want to add this happened around 4:45 AM.",

        "text": "One of my main hobbies is story writing. I’ve been writing since I was eight; I am now 23. Several times in my writing career, I have indirectly “predicted” odd events. It hasn’t happened often, I just find it strange that it happened more than once. \n\nThe first time, I was writing a story about a group of teenagers in school. One of the main characters was Westin, who had blonde curly hair, blue eyes, was 5’6, and had a crush on the main character. Well, that summer, I went to a summer camp. I met - you guessed it - a boy named Westin. Blonde curly hair, blue eyes, 5’6, and at the end of the week, admitted he had a crush on me. \n\nThe second time, I was writing a story about a family who survived a fire and became part of a secret organization. The main character’s name was Kensington Park. Well, a year or so later, construction workers began building a neighborhood across the street from us. I didn’t think anything of it - until I saw what they named the community. Kensington Park. And get this, the first house they started working on burned down within the first couple of weeks.\n\nMost recently, I began writing a story about space travel. At one point, a giant floating cluster of water is found floating around in space. Next thing you know, I scroll upon an article in my FaceBook feed about just that - scientists discovering a giant mass of water floating in space. \n\nNow, obviously it’s hard to prove this has actually happened, as people can say I wrote these stories after the events, and then lied about the date I started writing them. But given you all believe in things like this, do you think there’s any meaning behind it? Am I actually predicting future events, or is it just a strange series of coincidence? Please let me know what you think!",

The house was a two room and two bathroom trailer that one of my great uncles lend us. There was quite a few ghost encounters that happened and I’m here to tell ya. \n\nThe first encounter happened with my dad, he was trying to leave the house in his car, he looked through the review mirror and saw a little girl run behind it. Thinking it was either me, my sister, or our neighbors, he walked out and saw no one was there.\nAnother encounter also dealt with my dad, he was trying to take the trash out late at night. While he was doing so, he looked down at the ground and saw an orb slowly getting closer and glowing brighter. He at first thought it was the flashlight,but the orb didn’t leave until it got underneath him.\n\nEncounter three, while all of us were asleep, my mom woke up to the sound of someone sticking their finger into a fan, making that weird sound. That kept happening for a few minutes before their bed began to shake, waking my dad up. They were terrified to say the least.\n\nAnd the final one, it was when a friend of my sister stayed the night, us and my mom were staying up at night when momma called us outside. When we went out there, she pointed to the swing to show a lady sitting on it. At first I thought it was some weird prank, by the lady was hollow. She slowly got up and began to walk to the wood-line before disappearing into thin air.\n\nIt sucks the trailer isn’t there anymore, but we have pictures of the place with a ghosts in it if y’all wish to see.

        "text": "Earlier today, I was in the bathroom when I heard knocking on my bedroom door. I share the room with my roommate who was at work, and I share the apartment with two other friends who were in their room. I heard the knock again and I yelled from the bathroom \"Yeah?\", the door opened and banged loudly, I heard hurried shuffling, then the door closed. During that time, I called out who it was and my roommate's name, but there was no response. This was about 5 seconds. I then heard the front door close loudly. This was very strange because whoever it was should have been able to hear me clearly. I opened my phone to check my roommate's location, he was still at work. It took me about 30 seconds to leave the bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went over to my other roommates who were in their room. As I passed, I observed that the front door was locked, which could be locked on the way out. Their door was closed, I knocked and I went in. One roommate was in bed, the other was gaming, somewhat loudly. I asked the one gaming, who has been my friend for about a decade, if he went into my room. He said no, both of them have not left the room. I told them what happened and they asked if anything was missing. I am observant, and I did not notice anything missing, especially given the timeframe of 5 seconds. My friend went into my room to look around and asked me again if anything is missing. I said no, but I pointed out that I didn't recall a Mandalorian AT-ST lego sitting on my roommate's desk. It stood maybe a foot tall (if you look up on google, it comes up). I've never seen it before, but I was convinced that I overlooked it. I texted my roommate to ask if he came back but he said he didn't. I told him I'd tell him why I asked when he comes back from work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a joke, we went to Denny's for about an hour. I went over it with them, and we concluded that I just heard the apartment above us. I described it to them as someone rushing to get something because they were late to work. I was okay with this explanation, that everything I heard in the bathroom was the apartment above us. I've heard knocks before but I was pretty sure it was the neighboring apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we got back, my friend decided to be funny and take the AT-ST lego to see if my roommate would notice it was gone. I took a nap in my room. I woke up to my roommate coming back, about 3 hours after the incident. He sat on his desk but he didn't seem to notice a foot-tall lego was gone. I told him, \"Aren't you missing a certain lego?\", and he said no. I brought it to him and he was confused. It wasn't his. He has never seen it before. I was kinda laughing with my friend that I was right, someone broke in and left it there. I placed it on the coffee table in the living room and said, \"We need to dust this for prints\". I wanted to explain to my roommate what happened by reenacting what happened. I told him to go into the bathroom. I made the noises I heard, quickly, it was about 15 seconds worth of reenacting. This reenactment included me being in the living room and near the front door which I am 50% certain was locked. After 15 seconds, I spoke to my roommate some more for about 10 seconds. We went to the living room and the lego was gone. During this time, it was just me, the roommate that came back, and my friend for a decade who was in a middle of a game of League of Legends, the other roommate was in class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my friend and he didn't believe me that it was gone. I let him check our room and it's not anywhere. I looked all over the coffee table, it didn't fall anywhere. It's one foot tall where could it have gone? I believe my friend when he said that he didn't take it back, I looked in his room anyway. Besides, I was basically in the living room the entire time, I would have heard him get up, or the front door open if it was someone coming in to take it. It's just gone. To give perspective, the lego was on the coffee table for no more than one minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never been a person to believe in the paranormal, but this one is too hard to refute. There is absolutely no way this happens. I believe in my roommates, and logically, it couldn't have been them. I want to ask if this is paranormal, what could do this? I have little knowledge in the paranormal, but I don't recall ghosts being able to do this so easily. We have had no prior paranormal activities but previous tenants of our room have said they thought it was haunted.",

        "text": "In the last year or two, I’ve been having these really short nightmares that last a few seconds after waking up. They started off happening every couple of weeks/months and seem to be getting more frequent lately. The strange thing about them is that they’re always of me in my bed, as if I’m awake looking out into the darkness of my bedroom. In every single one, there’s always someone or something in the room with me. Once there was a woman kneeling on the floor next to my bed looking out the window, another a man hovering near the ceiling staring down at me. They’re usually just silhouettes as the room is always dark and I can’t make out any faces. These will literally last just seconds and always play out the same way: I survey the bedroom, squinting through the darkness and see an entity staring back at me. When I lock eyes with them, that’s when I feel this wave of fear wash over me and I suddenly wake up for real, usually sitting bolt upright. The part I hate the most though is the image is still burned in my brain that I swear I’m still seeing this thing for a few seconds before I realise it’s not really there and I’m no longer dreaming. It’s really creeping me out and this has happened several times in the last few weeks alone. The last couple of times, I actually shook my girlfriend awake and told her there was someone in the bedroom then realising I just had a nightmare. I know about sleep paralysis but I don’t think that’s it as I’m not having trouble waking up and don’t have the usual heavy feeling on my chest. Has anyone else experienced this?",

        "text": "Keys\n\nI've had many paranormal experiences throughout my life and even some unexplained experiences that make me question my own reality. If you want to hear more of my experiences, just let me know. I'm an open book. \n\nI call this one Keys for a very specific reason. When I was in high school, my long-time friend group would hang out regularly on the weekends. During one specific year, we used one house as our hangout spot. One member of the friend group had just moved into this house, and his mom let us do whatever we wanted. For the sake of his privacy, we can call him Dustin. The other members of the friend group were not there for this occasion, so their names do not matter right now. I had an experience at Dustin's house that has stuck with me to this day. Many experiences, actually, but this one in particular. \n\nI was at Dustin's house one night, along with his younger sister and his cousin. We were all sitting in his living room, all sharing space on a giant bean bag he owned. We were all excited that night because Dustin's mom had decided to stay at a friend's house that night. So we had the house all to ourselves. It seemed like a normal night until, suddenly, we all heard what sounded like a window breaking.  It sounded like it was coming from Dustin's little sisters room. Then it sounded like someone was tearing through the room, throwing things all around and breaking things. \n\nDustin's little sister and cousin began crying and screaming immediately. In a panic, Dustin and I ran to his sisters room (completely unarmed). We busted open her bedroom door, expecting to be greeted with whoever had just broken into the house. However, we were greeting with a room that was completely clean. \n\nNothing was out of place, and the window wasn't broken. We thought that maybe we mistook what room had been broken into. We proceeded to check every room in the house, only to be greeted with the same thing. No windows had been broken, and there was nobody else in the house. We were understandably confused by this. The four of us huddled together on the bean bag once more to console one another. \n\nThat's when I heard it. The sound that would completely change my perception of the paranormal. Of course, I didn't know at that moment that this sound would have such an impact. It sounded like a set of keys being dropped on a table, in his kitchen to our left. I jumped up to investigate, but once again, I found nothing. The rest of the night was uneventful, but we couldn't sleep. The next day, I told my mom about what had happened. She entertained the idea and listened to the story half-heartedly. That is, until I meanttioned the set of keys dropping. \n\nThat made her eyes go wide, which obviously concerned me. She told me that she needed to tell me something. She told me that when she was in high school, some of her friends were a but unsavory. Not only was she close friends with a practicing witch, but she even dated a Satan worshiper. It may have been a rebellious teen choice, seeing as how she was actually very religious. He eventually asked her to join in on a seance or a ritual of some kind. \n\nShe sat in the circle with him but refused to say anything. She told me that during the ritual, things began flying around the room and scared her so bad that she ran out and never talked to that guy again. She said that she felt as though something may have followed her though. She said that she always felt like she was being watched and as if something was always creeping up behind her after that. \n\nSo she told her friend that is a practicing witch about this event. Her friend told her that a demon may have tried to attach itself to her and that she needed some sort of protection. Her witch friend told her that she could help attach a protective entity to her. So her witch friend performed a ritual of her own. (Obviously, my mom didn't make the best decisions). \n\nAfter the ritual was over, her witch friend told her that the entity was with her and always would be. That he would protect her from any evil spirits that may intend harm. She then told my mom that she would know even this entity was present because he would make himself known. She said that you would know he was there if you heard the sound of keys jingling and that his name was keys. When my mom told me that, I felt ice in my veins. \n\nI obviously wondered if I had heard keys there that night at Dustin's. However, if he is attached to my mom, then why would I have heard him? Does he protect her and everything that belongs to her? I would ask if he is even real. It just seems like too scary a coincidence. What could I have heard if it wasn't keys? Why did we all hear someone or something absolutely tearing Dustin's little sisters room apart, only to suddenly stop. With everything still in its place. Let me know what you guys think.",

        "text": "So I recently had a spiritual awakening and keep realizing new things I've always wondered. I'm a very mentally ill individual so my thoughts are kind of dark. I think shadow people were mentally ill humans that committed suicide. They suffered being here so they come back and get their revenge/scare people here with their darkness. Personally I'm neurodivergent, so this world wasn't made for people like me. I'm at a high risk of suicide. I just thought as a joke wouldn't it be cool to scare the people that unintentionally bothered me lol. Normal people aren't bothered by things others aren't effected by because of my sensory issues. It's a living nightmare for me. I live in headphones. I feel bitter towards the world. Long story short, I think I'll become a shadow person.",

        "text": "I have a chronic illness called PCOS, aka polycystic ovary syndrome, that causes cysts to grow on my ovaries and, as a result, I experience very painful cramps during my period. It's actually fairly common, 1 in 10 women have it, apparently, but I digress.\n\nI was once having yet another bad bout of cramps that left me curled in the fetal position on my bedroom floor, groaning, annoyed, and feeling somewhat out of it. Not delirious or feverish by any means, but I do feel like it's worth mentioning.\n\nAt one point, I glance up and see what appears to be two middle-aged men standing over me.\n\nThey both appeared to be completely gray--as if they'd just stepped out of a black-and-white movie--and were dressed in old-fashioned clothing. I remember, at the time, thinking that they resembled the man in the Quaker Oats logo. They were looking down at me with thinly concealed looks of disgust on their faces and would periodically glance back up to say something to one another. However, there was no sound, like there was a mute button on their existence.\n\nWhat struck me, in hindsight, was my total lack of concern at finding two gray strangers in bizarre clothes standing in my home. I recall looking up at them from the floor and just thinking \"Huh. Welp, that's odd.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, reopened them maybe a minute later and they were both gone.\n\nAfter my cramps had subsided, I started actually thinking about the experience. That was weird. *Very* weird. I've never hallucinated at any other point in my life. I hadn't been sleeping/didn't feel even vaguely sleepy, so it wasn't sleep paralysis or hypnagogic hallucinations. I just felt like shit from period cramps and that's never produced hallucinations before. Why would it?\n\nI've had a handful of unexplainable experiences in my home (doorknob rattling but no one's there, shit like that) and I recalled how these men resembled a number of other descriptions of spirits I've heard in the past. So...damn, maybe they were?\n\nI thought about their funny manner of dress; very old fashioned, probably from the 1600s-1700s. What was going on in this area in the 1600s-1700s? It was a Dutch colony. Ok, let's Google the fashion of the  Dutch settlers from that time period.\n\nOh god, we've got a match.\n\nSo, yeah. I think I had two dead Dutch guys staring at me on the floor and talking shit about me to each other like \"Ugh, pathetic\".",

        "text": "Can anybody relate? I have experienced, in my opinion, a high number of paranormal or unexplained encounters.\n\nThe first that comes to mind: Sleeping in one of the oldest houses in a small midwest town. I (13 at the time) fell asleep in the couch that night. I lived with my brother (9), my sister (15) and my mother. I rolled off the couch in the middle night, and awoke when I hit the floor. When my eyes opened, there was a grown man standing over me with his hand out as if to offer to help me up. In my tired daze, I accepted the helping hand without realizing I have never seen this man in my life. He gently laid me on the couch and disappeared down my hallway toward my mom’s room. After checking the house that night then asking everybody the next morning, it was confirmed there were no guests in the house that night.\n\nEncounter 2: \nAge 15 or 16. I was on “house arrest” at the time. No ankle bracelet, but ordered to stay home through court supervision. I had a friend over at night. We were in the back yard “looking through the telescope” between 8pm and 9pm. Suddenly, branches start violently snapping along the tree line on the rear side of our back yard as if something BIG is charging through it, destroying everything in its path. We look over, and see what resembles a very muscular wolf running on its hind legs. It sprinted toward, jumped over, and snapped a chunk of wood off the top of a fence that stood about 6.5 ft. All on its hind legs. We both flipped after about 5 seconds of silence doing the usual “Did you just see that?!” \nMonths later, after telling my mom about this experience, she yelled for me to turn on a certain channel on the TV that was featuring a special documentary about the “Beast of Brey Road” \nTurns out the area we lived in at the time had been receiving reports of the same animal for decades. \n\nEncounter 3:\nAge 17. Riding in the back seat of a friends van, 4 people inside. we turn right on a busy intersection when an apparition appeared as if it was walking on the cross walk. It passed through the center of the vehicle, and every person in the car watched it pass between the passengers inside the vehicle as we drove through it.\n\nEncounter 4:\nAge 17. Walking through a farmers field with a buddy at night. The crop was just harvested so you can see all the way across the field. Sharing a joint, we look over and see two people mirroring our body movements perfectly and in sync. We eventually turn toward them and they turn toward us. We walk toward each other until we met at an isolated tree in the middle of the field. I’m willing to accept shadows as an explanation for this one. But we were about 200 feet apart when all of this started.\n\nEncounter 5:\nAge 21. This one was at a supposedly haunted location that is local to me. It’s a well in the middle of the woods. After dangling my self in the well and peeing in it, we took a picture (link in the comments). It almost looks like a demon face behind me. It’s easier to see with your brightness turned up or in a dark room. I wont be upset if you pick it apart though.",

        "text": "I recently bought a house on the edge of a big forest. My father passed away when I was 19, and since my parents were divorced I inherited everything myself. After my father’s passing, I had trouble focusing on school so while I was supposed to graduate when I turned 21, I only just graduated this year after turning 24. After finishing school I bought a beautiful old house on the edge of a giant forest on the edge of my childhood town.\nI wanted to turn this house into a bed and breakfast but it needed a lot of renovating.\n\nWhile renovating this house I’m living in it myself as right now I cannot afford a second house to live in.\nThe house came with some old floodlights that illuminate the first line of trees in the backyard, making for a beautiful scene when eating dinner.\nEvery night when I can’t sleep because of my paranoia, I go to my window and look out to the trees and the night sky.\n\nNow here’s where the first strange thing happens, a couple of times when looking outside between 1 and 4 am I could see strange flickering lights in the woods. It almost looked like reflections of a bunch of disco balls in the forest. But the strangest part is the fact that I could clearly see them move. I never really thought anything of it and just brushed it off as some fireflies or something similar.\n\nThis strange phenomenon still keeps going on to this day months later.\nHowever, a couple of weeks after moving in I woke up one night to strange noises. I swear it sounded like scratching at the old wooden doors and windows downstairs. I never got the courage to get up and go look as I am incredibly paranoid and still check my closet before bed every night at 24 years old.\n\nI did however put a night vision camera down after those sounds happened the second night in a row. I also put some eggs and other food scraps in front of the camera as this always seemed to work when I was a child.\n\nThis is where things turn increasingly worrying. I had been putting this camera down for a couple of days and every morning when I went to check, the camera was either turned around, flipped down or sometimes even completely somewhere else. This made me think it’s some guy pranking me. However, every single morning all the food was gone and there were never any footprints on the grass in the mud or anywhere else. Even on rainy muddy nights there was no trace of what took the food.\n\nI had a terrible feeling every morning when I looked outside and saw the camera was gone again. I just knew deep down this was something more, something else other than a human or some other animal.\n\nOn a friday night after working hard the whole day I noticed I forgot to put the camera outside after putting the food out, I thought to myself “I’m not going out there in the middle of the night with the food there already” so I decided to take another look at the footage I already had from the countless times before.\nI then noticed something I hadn’t noticed before.\nEvery single time before the camera got knocked over, it turned quiet. And I mean completely quiet, as if the sound glitched or got removed. No more owls or nightly animals, just silence. Then skipping an hour forward the noises returned. This happened on every single video, every. Single. One.\n\nThis same scene kept going on and on for months until finally when working on the garden I had a wooden fence put down.\n\nAfter I put the fence down I thought it would be useless putting the camera and the food down again as there was no way this animal could get in my backyard anymore.\n\nI went to sleep and when I woke up, I went to the kitchen looking out into the backyard when my heart sank into what felt like an endless abyss.\nThe newly placed fence was completely demolished, there was a massive hole in the middle of the fence about a full meter wide. \nI know what you’re thinking but there are no bears in my area, not even in my country. I have no clue what bursted through my fence that night and neither did the authorities.\n\nThat is the reason I posted this, this happened just this monday and I have no clue what to do next. The scary part is that I found wood splinters all the way towards where I usually put the food out. Still, there was not a trace of any footsteps or animal traces.\n\nI haven’t slept in the house since that night and I’ve stayed this week back at my moms house as I’m honestly too scared to go back there unless it’s bright daylight.\n\nI wanted to post this here to ask you guys: what is this? What did I accidentally lure into my backyard? And how do I get rid of it.",

I opened the door and a huge raven flew at me and my daughter flapping and squawking getting caught in my daughters waist length hair.. she was screaming.. the more she tried to get the bird out the more entangled it became .. then I woke up with a start hearing my daughter screaming in her bedroom.. I ran into her, she was thrashing about screaming that she had a bird caught in her hair and couldn’t get it out! We had both had the same dream at the same time.. really shook me for a while and something I will never forget .",

I would wake up at around midnight with a little light shining through my window and I would see someone standing in the middle of the room in his underwear. I don’t remember what kind of expression was on his face but I remember he would be standing right in front of my dresser facing the side of my bed. I would say something like “daddy?” or “what time is it?” But he wouldn’t respond. I would close my eyes for a little bit and try to fall back asleep. But when I opened them again he would be gone. This kind of thing would happen a couple times a week for maybe a month and then kind of just stopped. I don’t know if this was my tired imagination at night or if it was a dream or if there was actually someone in my room.",

I also hope this is ok to post here.\n\nI woke up at 5:30am, and usually everyone else in the house are asleep, my parents and my brother.\n\nThese noises came primarily from the northern points of the house and usually around the kitchen or dining room, but I did hear some from right below me and sometimes to my right on the first floor. \n\nThey varied in noise level, sometimes being soft but no louder than a hard singular knock. They sometimes sounded like footsteps or stomping, but usually they sounded like knocks, and two times I heard the backyard blinds move, which are also in the kitchen. These noise level of these bangs ranged from mild to slightly above moderately loud. The knocks and footsteps also happened 1 at a time and slowly. If three were paired together, they would be spaced out by 1-2 seconds.\n\nAfter a single trip to the washroom after initially waking up, I spent most of that time paralyzed in an upright position in my bed. If it weren’t for my dad waking up around 7am, and getting him to investigate for me, I would’ve been late for work. I’m not sure when it stopped, but the last one I heard was before he left his room. I ran out of the house at that point.\n\nSome background information: my brother has a slightly loose headboard for his bed, but I’d only occasionally hear it banging against the wall but it was far more consistent and louder than his, and he’s not known to toss and turn in his sleep very often. We are also very cautious about sneaky rodents trying to run into the house, and the wind was very light this morning. I also live in a quiet suburban area.\n\nI’m curious to hear y’all’s opinions on my experience, because I’m still a little bit shook.",

We were at the beach, packing up and getting ready to head back to the condo, I went ahead and walked back because I was covered in sand and wanted to take a shower. It wasn’t a long walk back to the condo, but it was enough that they needed to pack the beach gear onto a golf cart. When I arrived at the condo, I saw my grandmother, and she let me in. At this point, the sand I was covered in was really starting to irritate my skin, so although I thought it was weird that my grandmother beat me home, I just wanted to take a shower. It wasn’t until I had taken a shower, dried off, and gone upstairs that my family arrived home. They were really confused and asking how I got in the house without a key, I told them that my grandmother let me in and they just looked even more confused. Apparently my grandmother had never left the beach when they were packing, and that my grandfather was the only one with a key - and the door was locked. I don’t remember any expression on my grandmother's face when she let me in, she just kind of unlocked and opened the door, and I hurried in. It wasn’t possible for my grandmother to beat me home without me seeing her - and the route is long enough that a woman of her age wouldn’t be able to walk there and back in that time frame. It still creeps me out to this day.",
