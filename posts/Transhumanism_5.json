I’ve also had bad luck making connections through transhumanist groups on platforms like Discord, where the tendency is for a handful of bros to have built echo chambers so they can listen to themselves talk all day. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has any helpful suggestions, or you find yourself in a similar situation, please let me know. I’d love to have a few friends in my life who are open-minded, passionate transhumanists.

        "text": "Transhumanism doesn't have to be spiritual, but for me (and countless others) it is. And this post is to say that's because Transhumanism is nicely spiritual; both worlds (of tech/flesh and transcendence) go together like, well, Democracy and the Revelation chapter of the Bible.\n\nI'm all about atheism replacing Christianity. Because I'm confident that I can experiment spiritually in an atheistic society, versus a Christian society. That's extra important to appreciate; freedom.\n\nTranshumanism is nicely spiritual because it is the actually the application of the transcendental True Will. We are manifesting what has been kept secret for 2.022+ thousand years. And while most Transhumanists are **probably** not Alchemists, a dialogue about this subject is needed. Right here. This is wonderful to have the opportunity to do.\n\nSo what will is be? Are we to ignore the threat posed by radiKal Khristian Klans? Or do we unite behind the atheists and pressure them to change from within after the End of Times?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/zvwymr/the_5_stages_of_gain/",
        "text": "We have heard about the 5 stages of loss, but when it comes to technological progress; society reacts in a very different way. We collectively struggle to incorporate new transformative technological developments into everyday life. \n\nWhy we do this is because the shift isn’t gradual with a slowly growing amount of people using the technology, but because the simple act of pioneering it represents a seismic shift on the societal scale. It happens because society nearly-instantly shifts from not even conceiving of the technology, to focusing on developing it. \n\nThe most salient example as of the writing of this (26 Dec. 2022) is the explosion of AI art this year. At the very beginning of this year, the idea that art could be AI generated was seen as ridiculous by anyone who didn’t work in Machine Learning. But only a year later, it is seen as a given that AI art will eventually surpass human artists. \n\nThat is just an example of the seismic social shift that happens overnight. We went from a resting-state of assumed ignorance of the possibility that AI art could be a thing; and the moment the first major model DALL-E went public, the new resting-state became focusing on researching art models and making them better. Even if the technology wasn’t a major shift, the fundamental way that our society reacts towards it is a monumental one. \n\nThe way people react towards the seismic shift of technological development is something I call the 5 Stages of Gain. Step 1 happens before people are even aware of a possibility, Steps 2, 3 and 4 tend to all happen at the same time, and step 5 is radical acceptance of the new technology. \n\n*The past stage*\n\nStage 1: Denial\n\n“Denial” in this sense means ignorance. Ignorance of the possibility of a technology is the norm before the possibility of the technology is introduced by pioneering it. In terms of our example with AI art, this period of denial lasted from the beginning of Humanity, to the year 2021 CE. Usually in this period, people might have a more positive outlook on the hypothetical technology thinking that it is “utopian” if it is ever mentioned. \n\n*The contemporary stages: These steps usually happen all at once, and are expressed by different types of people*\n\nStage 2: Anger\n\n“Anger” is the reaction that conservative-minded people have. Examples of this are neo-Luddites, primitivist, or people who might be negatively affected by the advancement, like artists in this example. This is the most destructive phase as these people will attempt to actively fight against the new technology. An example would be the “Stop AI Art” movement, or primitivist shooting up Google HQ again. Normally this stage tends to rapidly subside after a decade or two, but there is always at least a very small amount of people on this stage, usually neo-Luddites. \n\nStage 3: Depression\n\nThis one is probably the most famous one, and is a tale as old as time. People on this stage tend to be elderly people who just hate anything new, and think that the world is either ending or getting worse because of young people embracing the new technology. This stage rapidly dies off with the elderly of that generation. \n\nStage 4: Bargaining\n\nThis is the stage that the vast majority of society is on. Usually people here tend to be agnostic towards the new technology and think that they would approve of it if it was better. An example being that most people support AI art but wish it could animate or draw hands better. When the technology improves; these people are the ones who support the transition and drive humanity forward. \n\n*The future stage: This stage will last until there is a new better technology, or until the end of humanity*\n\nStage 5: Acceptance\n\nThis final stage is when society finally embraces its new resting point of embracing the new technology. At this point the vast majority of society approves of the technology and the idea that it was ever controversial would seem outlandish. Like how nobody today is aware that electricity was ever controversial. \n\n———-\n\nGenerally this cycle is overlooked because the opposition to the new technology (Stages 2 and 3) is way overshadowed by the Stage 4 moderates. But as the pace of technological advancement is accelerating, this cycle is becoming a lot more bipolar and dynamic. Stage 2 and 3 people are becoming a larger and larger share of the population, and the rapid pace of progress has become very noticeable to even normal people. As a result, this cycle is becoming a lot more obvious and prominent.",

We can travel in and out, to other realities, but only as souls (you leave your body aka. worldsuit here, and take possession of a different previously unensouled one there if that's what you want to do). Meditation will get you further than a spaceship, as space is fake, so if you blast off in a rocket you'll just hit the inner firmament, but the universe is unimaginably big in terms of worlds which you can live on in addition to our big beautiful flat Earth (which, despite its beauty, is unfortunately controlled by lizard people, jewish to a disproportionate degree, on a low level and evil loosh farming archons on a high level). You are not nobody. You are somebody. Earth is flat, space is fake.",

Season Two will kick off on January 20th, 2023!\n\nThe conversation starts with the observation that it is progressives, those who believe in science most ardently, that are most cautious about how to deal with complex problems, whereas those who call themselves “conservative” are the ones who are most vocal about wishing to push the envelope and drive innovation.  Is there a paradox to “progressives” being precautionary and “conservatives” proactionary, or is this an illusion? The conversation also touches on other burning questions such as: ‘Is there such a thing as an enlightened billionaire or is that an oxymoron?’, ‘Can people who are scandalized about environmentalists throwing paint on pieces of art claim any moral high ground when denouncing those they accuse of “art-terrorism”?, and  is calling Death the worst of all evils, to be hated and feared, the path to a much more anxious way of living, in contrast to making peace with its reality and being ready to leave if and when it comes?’\n\n**Main Topics**\n\nTranshumanism, Death, Religion, Innovation, the Precautionary Principle, the Proactionary principle.\n\n**Links**\n\n• [http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/](http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/)  \n• [https://www.youtube.com/user/GStolyarovII](https://www.youtube.com/user/GStolyarovII)  \n• [https://twitter.com/GStolyarovII](https://twitter.com/GStolyarovII)  \n• [https://www.instagram.com/gennadystolyarovii/](https://www.instagram.com/gennadystolyarovii/)",

Their materialist and globalist cosmology is based around Earth being a small and inconsequential realm within a large yet explorable universe, however what if that wasn't wrong though within an immaterialist and non-globalist cosmological framework? What if we actually live on a flat disc within a physically impenetrable bubble, and not a ball within physically traversable space as the globalists suggest? To them, the universe cyclically began with a big bang and it will end with the conclusion of entropy into a heat death equilibrium, however what if the universe in fact cyclically began with the godhead becoming the universe and all souls within it, and it will end when each of these souls has fully experienced the entirety of possible existence within our universe, or in other words, an equilibrium of consciousness? So with this, why would we as souls choose to incarnate on a gulag-like prison planet in the first place, one featuring a reincarnation soul trap based around temptation causing potentially very long periods of captivity and enslavement? Well, is that not part of experiencing the entirety of possible existence within our universe, something necessary to achieve nirvana? Surely it is. Perhaps, when the last soul achieves nirvana, our universe will end, and thereafter, be cyclically reborn. You know how we can imagine dystopias? Well, I think we (as pure aphysical consciousness) can incarnate there provided what we imagine lines reasonably well up with a reality. That's why we're probably here if you ask me, and the goal is to escape, literally just for the hell of it. Everyone loves a good dystopian greentext, so why not experience it for real?

Under this assumption, I see two interlinked fundamental problems with the idea of creating non-human sentients:\n\n 1.) the ethical reason. If a sentient non-human is created, it will (because it isn't going to be easy, at least the first couple times) be done for self-serving reasons of some human or group of humans, either economic (that is, the created sentient non-human is used as expendable workforce with more easily challenged rights, if rights at all) or military (that is, the created sentient non-human being used effectively as cannon fodder). This would mean, that these created non-human sentients would basically be just created to be abused and exploited, while clearly dislikeing being used in this way (because we are still operating under the presumption that they aren't specifically hardwired to enjoy what they are going to be used for)\n\n2.) the pragmatic reason. Sentient non-humans would be competitors to humanity, and, given that, based on what I wrote under 1.) they would justifiably resent humanity, this competition is unlikely to be amicable. This would be harmfull to human intrests. \n\nBut the thing is, created senteint non-humans would be extremly usefull (consider how often on this sub it is suggested, that once Humanity get's an AGI working the singularity will soon follow). So, is there some counter to my reasoning I overlooked (except the idea I disqualified at the start)?",

I have to fight my intuition, biases, and assumptions every moment of every day for my rational mind to prevail; I make frequent mistakes. I see others’ deeply irrational thinking patterns they aren’t even aware of (and worry more about what I’m oblivious to), and they make life much more difficult than it should be.\n\nOn a societal level, they wreck politics, perpetuate immoral cultures, stoke tribalism, and so forth. Every time I see people, especially myself, falling for simple logical fallacies, acting on illiberal tendencies, or living primitive, animalistic lives in rural Africa or South America, I just want to break down and cry, knowing I’m little better genetically and what little advantage I have is mostly social. I’ve had to study mathematics for years (and not without difficulty) to train my mind to think mathematically and logically. For example the untrained brain actually thinks logarithmically to understand scale, not linearly. A small child or primitive tribesman would perceive 3 as the halfway point between 1 and 9, not 5, for example.\n\nI’ve had strong doubts about religion, but one of the psychological needs it sates for me is belief in a pure soul fighting these animalistic tendencies to achieve greater goods, like reason and true morality. \n\nIf only, though digital augmentation, we could shuffle off this mortal coil in exchange for reason, purity, and beauty.

        "text": " dna computing is something i have an eye on you see its exactly what it sounds like  a computer using dna to store and process data through the use of a molecular compiler. the reason im bringing this to the attention of everyone is what might be possible if in the future the programs can be run and maintained without the compiler. without the burden of the mechanical compiler, these genetic programs could theoretically be inserted into cells to add unnatural abilities as the program runs in the cell as an organel. at the highest level this line of thought could give rise to an artificial mitochondria to either support or replace the old inefficient natural mitochondria. \n\nwhy would anyone want artificial mitochondria you may ask well for one it would turn your body into an enormous self-replicating and self-repairing computer network with near-limitless capability. even if each individual unit has very limited capability (which is likly) you would have trillions of them to pick up the slack. now the second reason is that this would enable the direct modification of cells to alter their shape and function at will thus enabling some of the most extreme body modifications possible given our current understanding. even other modifications like cybernetics would be improved by this like if a mechancal part is needed for something the cells cant do they could alter themselves to better conect with the new part.\n\n if you think this application is far-fetched years ago scientists swapped the mitochondria of 2 microorganisms they then began developing traits of the other. so control the mitochondria  and you control your biology completly",

Especialy if you have seen me throw around my personal wish for theseus brain cyberizing, and agree, you'll think off body self improvement next, or long for it at least.\n\nfirst I reiterate my conclusion, nanorobots are useless. they're too small, too fragile, too slow and frankly - no way we can put in a power source, processing and sensors worth shit in such a small package. i say they're fragile, because heat management is simppy next to impossible at such a scale, and the only way to protect the swarm is to sacrifice units. but building new units with random crap found laying around? i dont even know if thats possible without external power supply. probably not. i have been argued against saying nanites are weak to acid already, but the other person simply failed to understand an important fact: when acids and alkalis react, its in the form of forcefully exchanging electrons and basicaly bullying the other substance into reaction - this will also happen to nanites when exposed. if crap like acetic acid doesnt work, shit such as aqua requim most likely will.\n\nwhy am i saying this now? because we dont even **need** nanites for artificial self improvement. yes, you can employ true nanites for molecular assembly, but thats all *material sciences*, you dont *NEED* matsci to be mobile. what you want for that is a stationary foundry, even if you want to work in your body - like the spleen, cultivating proto immune cells from stem cells and releasing them into the blood stream for differentiating. \n\nanyway, what *would* we need? well, thats rather simple. micron scale robots.  \nperfect size to push cells around, hunt cancer, and tend to other crap like bones, nerves, blood vessels. and once we figure out how to cultivate cybernoid cells? let them put those in place and retire our flesh easily.",

Instead we created a relationship with this powerful entity, we asked it to protect us, love us, and give us answers to our deepest questions in life, the world and the universe. \n\nWe envisioned an eternal afterlife where an ecstatic existence is the norm while death and suffering is an alien concept. We also envisioned an eternal torment  for those who committed injustices, tho in Judaism it's different than the christian concept of hell.\n\nWell, You guys know where I'm getting at! I think AGI will be our modern version of a God! Instead of, Praying, listening to priests or reading bibles, Qurans  and Torahs and shit. Through a secular, humanistic world view, We will ask this powerful digital entity for enlightenment, happiness, justice, eternal life and carve a heaven out of this cold, violent and hostile universe!\n\nFuck your job.",
