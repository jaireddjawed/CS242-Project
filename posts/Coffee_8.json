Thing is, pouring this much in is impossible. After about 400mL , the brew time starts getting really long and the coffee turns to this black mush. To get this amount of water in it would take my about 8+ minutes to brew and I heard the recommended brew time is 4 minutes. \n\nAlso, in order to get a brew time of 4 minutes with 35 grams, I can't grind at the recommended setting of 20 with my encore, I have to crank it up to 28 or so because at 20 the grind is too fine and the brew time goes up to like 8 minutes.",

Counter top space is a premium and everything needs to be somehow attached/anchored down or put away when not in use. \n\nI've seen counter built in machines like Modbar before this would be ideal since it takes minimal counter space and it isn't going anywhere. I'd go with Modbar except its outrageously expensive and the under counter unit is hugely massive, I get it, its for commercial coffee shops and needs to make consistant espresso shots all day. However, I will only be making a few lattes a day.\n\nI've attempted to look for alternatives but modbar seems to flooded the market (good for them, annoying for me), not sure if they are the only game in town.\n\nThis leads me to two questions:\n\n1. Is anyone aware of something like Modbar designed and priced for the home market? (preferred)\n2.  Is it possible to buy just the Modbar above counter grouphead, so I can pipe the steam from a dissected home unit just below the counter. (Read warning below)\n\nWarning: Working with pressurized gasses can be very dangerous if you don't know what your doing, I've worked on piping for scuba fill systems at a previous job (4000psi / \\~275bar) so I'm well aware of these dangers - however the professional in me requires this warning.",

I also switch the beans to lavazza beans. I've been rinsing the brew unit about once a week like they recommend and all has been good till now. The first bag of beans were the gran crema and it was all good but wanted to try the super crema and right around that time is when I noticed it change slightly. Sometimes the first few pucks in the bin are wet and fall apart but as more fall in there might be one or two nice pucks in there. Coffee this tastes fine not too sour/bitter.\n\nI didn't change the grind setting they were at 2, only now did I put it to 1 to see what difference that might make. This bag of beans is also about 7 months old where the first one was only about 2-3 months old, that should have no effect on the pucks though. I haven't yet lubricated the brew group myself only what was there out the box. Maybe doing the rinsing of the brew group every 1-2 weeks has now rinsed it away. Also since about 2-3 weeks ago there's more coffee being made, about 7-9 shots/day. At this rate it says to grease every 2 months. That could have also caused the grease to be not as effective. I also just now will order the oil removing tablets from amazon because they say to use this once a month. \n\nCould all of this together cause more watery pucks? Sorry its my first espresso/superautomatic so not sure.",

So I don't know anything about it, anything more than \"load the ground beans onto the filter into the top of the coffee maker, add water to the reservoir, hit start, pour and add creamer.\"\n\nHowever, my wife loves her **vanilla and/or caramel lattes**. Typically, my role in abetting this has been to go to Starbucks and ask for one, and that's all I needed to do. However, we just bought a house, meaning that we have more room for appliances and less money and time for daily $6 drinks.\n\nThe wife has started dropping hints that I would be an amazing husband if I a.) bought us a \"latte machine\" and b.) learned how to make her morning lattes. This appears to be slightly more complex than \"load the ground beans onto the filter,\" etc. I have learned that to do lattes, you need an \"espresso machine\" along with perhaps something called a \"milk frother,\" but I have no idea how to use a milk frother (do you use milk? not creamer? does it need to be a certain %?) or what sort of special coffee beans you need for espresso, or what the overall process is for making a latte using an espresso machine. In addition, there appear to be espresso machines on the market for everything from $100 to $1,000, and I have no idea what I'm getting into. I don't want to spend a bunch on a machine that I can't figure out how to use. I also don't need to make 2 cups at a time -- I noticed that many machines do that, but I sure won't be drinking any of it myself.\n\nSo ... What would be the **simplest way, for a reasonable cost, for me to be able to learn how to make lattes at home for the wife?** What should I buy (machine, beans, milk, syrup, anything else) and what do I need to do each morning to fulfill this?\n\nThanks for the help!",

I was able to return one to Fellow for a credit of $317 and now I'm looking at what to buy with it.\n\nI already have their electric kettle, too many mugs to count, and a cheap French press from IKEA. Everything i have works well so i wasnt really looking to upgrade. \n\nFor sure getting the larger pourover and carafe but that only takes $100 off the card. There's the Clara French press but that just seems obscene for a French press. \n\n\nMy main uncertainty is looking at the Opus grinder. I have a Breville Barista Express, but that already has a grinder on it that functions ok enough. From what I've been reading/watching on the Opus, it's a bit of a cheaper product overall. Not sure if it'll spoil the experience of getting another nice coffee product. Would y'all think it's worth the upgrade enough?\n\nIts not lost on me that it's all free but it's all analysis paralysis at this point. The card expires in Feb 2024 so i was also considering buying the pour over system now and then setting a date next Jan to make the rest of the purchase in hopes that I've proven i want the Opus or that something new is out.",

The glass caraf select model is the only one that is made to do so.  \n\nHow is the coffee quality of brewing half a pot on any model but the select?\n\nHow good or bad is the burner on the glass caraf select model?  Will it “burn” the coffee?\n\nUltimately I wan to buy the KBGT thermal caraf model.  I just want o make sure it will brew half a pot well without too much tinkering.  \n\nAny input is appreciated.",

As it cools the smoky taste gets better, but that aftertaste still wobbles between berries and cigarettes (odd, I know). Does this sound like a roast defect or an issue with how I'm brewing it?

I don't make my espresso at home but planing to in the future. So this grinder may also serve as espresso grinder in the future.\n\nI'have put my eye on the melitta calibra. The built-in scale attracted me. Would be my first choice for now. \nOtherwise, the sage grinders may be a second choice, but somehow out of budget.\n\nBrewer experts, what do you think, any recommendations for a 150 200 euros grinder ? \n\nThanks folks in advance.",

        "text": "It seems since the rise in popularity of chain coffee shops like Starbucks and Dutch Bros, coffee culture (in the business sense) has greatly changed. Coffee shops were widely regarded as a place where people would meet up, sit down, and sip their coffee in a relaxed manner. It seems a major shift happened, a lot of coffee shops are more fast paced, having drive thrus and single use cups. Its hard to find a coffee shop where I live that uses reusable mugs meant to be returned to the barista and wash. Even if Im sitting down in a cafe, I get a disposable cup. In my opinion, its very wasteful.\n\nAnother thing is cup sizes. These cups are huge, especially with espresso drinks. Its insane to me that the largest latte cup size I own is 10.5 oz, which Ill fill with two shots of espresso to get a nice 1:3.5 ratio of coffee to milk. A hot grande (16 oz) and venti (20 oz) also has two shots of espresso. Thats an approximate 1:5 and 1:7 ratio of coffee to milk. They’re not kidding when they say all Starbucks is is milk and sugar.\n\nAnother thing, correlating with sizes, is price. Understandably, a special drink (eg a Frappe) that takes a lot of work and time is going to cost more than your average cup of joe. But now even a normal coffee can cost you upwards of $4-6 including tax and tip. I understand inflation obviously plays a role in this price, but the change in coffee culture to more specialized expensive drinks must also be a factor.\n\nOn the upside, coffee is more accessible and diverse than ever before, letting coffee shops venture into new drinks with different flavors. America (where I live) is a very “fast” culture so including Drive-Thrus and pickup is necessary to have so much business. Its great that theres been a rise in coffee shops lately, letting in more jobs and social areas for those who do treat coffee shops as a meetup to chat with friends or a date.\n\nI am most certainly not trying to be some sort of coffee snob, these are just observations Ive noticed since I first started being a home barista with my little espresso machine. What are your thoughts? Is this change a good or bad thing? I can only speak from experience in the US, so for those in other countries, has coffee culture changed where you live too?",

Well…we already went through that bag so yesterday I went out to find a new kind to try. We live in Alaska so….No one’s growing coffee up here of course, but I noticed that some bags say “proudly roasted in Alaska” but don’t say where the beans came from. And some bags will say “grown at ___ altitude, fair trade, ect..” but still don’t say where they come from. A few bags will say exactly what country and region. I’m not really sure it matters for anything practical but I am very curious about it! Is it just a bunch of beans from all over mixed together?",
