        "text": "I used to always fail English in high school. One day I felt like using the language (reading articles in blogs) and I kept doing it day after day until the following year I started to pass the subject and then in baccalaureate I graduated with a 9.6 out of 10, an almost perfect grade.\n\nI continued to use the language, no longer having it as a subject in my education (I am studying History at university). I read a lot of books in the language (I've read 53 so far, with the goal of reaching 80 by the end of this 2023), and I also listen to a lot of podcasts.\n\nI was doing all that because I thought I was going to use the language when I got to college with exchange students. This 2022 was my second year of university and I have only used the language 2 times in the whole year, and the conversations were not even 2 minutes each because they were tourists asking me some question. It turns out that most exchange students at my university (and I guess in other parts of Spain too) are French, German and Italian, in that order. And they all spoke more or less Spanish, so there was no need to speak English.\n\nAfter all this effort and time going against the tide -- because in my country they hardly speak English (one of the countries with the lowest English proficiency in Europe) and there is not much interest in learning it other than as a New Year's resolution that is then given up on the next month -- I find myself asking: has it really been worth it, to find myself now with no opportunities to speak or use the language?\n\nThe only use I see for the language now is to put it on my resume and have it only be a factor in choosing me over other candidates who don't know the language; even though I probably won't have to speak the language on the job itself.\n\nThis has completely killed my motivation to keep improving. I am thinking of starting to read a book in English to get a little closer to the goal of 80 books read in this language but I think: why force myself if now I feel like reading that book that I have half read in Spanish and, besides,  it is the only language I use in my daily life, in my studies and I will use in my future job?\n\nHave any of you felt this way? What do you do in this situation?",

(I always assumed the kana keyboard on smartphones was the same as the old pre-smartphone one, which I had to use when I lived in Japan in 2004-2005.)\n\nWhat is really awesome is that the keys are huge, and the layout by its very nature avoids the worst problem with typing in QWERTY on a phone: every other letter (ish) is a vowel, and UIO are right next to each other.\n\nThe only other layout I can think of that has so few keys is Korean, which is truly a genius layout.\n\nAs far as alphabetic (and/or abugida-ic) languages go, I was surprised to realize that Greek has just enough fewer letters than the Latin alphabet that the keys can be enlarged quite a bit. \n\nMeanwhile, Russian is mildly annoying (and iOS still doesn‚Äôt have swipe typing for Russian) and Thai is an absolute dumpster fire.\n\nHow about you guys, how are the mobile keyboard layouts for your languages, if they are significantly different from QWERTY/AZERTY?",

        "text": "Generally speaking, we have time limits for active projects in our lives--including languages. Once that time limit passes, we will cease prioritizing learning the language and turn our energies elsewhere--whether we acknowledge this reality or not.\\*\n\nWhen this moment occurs, it is critical to have a plan for language maintenance. Why? Well, like many other skills, language proficiency falls in the \"use it or lose it\" category. Emphasis on the verb \"use.\" Because again, once the time limit is up, our motivation to undertake any activity that could possibly count as studying/work is going to be minimal to nonexistent.\\*\\*\n\nIn other words, whatever you can do in the language when you start maintenance--not study, do, and for fun--is essentially what you'll be able to do to maintain the language. And so we come to my two insights:\n\n1. **Be realistic about how long the language will be an active project, and adjust your learning velocity accordingly**. My hunch is that most people's limits will fall between 2‚Äì4 years. So no, you don't want a \"learn in 3 months\" mentality, but you do want to be reasonably efficient and ambitious. When in doubt, assume a shorter timeline.\n2. **Plan your final proficiency level with maintenance in mind**. This is the reason for the post. You want to aim for a proficiency level that doesn't just allow you to do the activities you want to do to maintain the language--it must also allow you to do them *for fun*. There are two subtleties: 1) you have to be completely honest with yourself, and 2) the level might be higher than you anticipate, [adding to the reasons to aim for a higher level](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/upyfd8/why_i_encourage_reaching_an_advanced_level/). For example, I could make it through a telenovela in Spanish (with subtitles) with B1 listening. But it wasn't fun; it was work. Watching TV in Spanish wasn't fun until my listening was a solid C1 (and I didn't need subs). Different people have different thresholds, of course: B1 listening might be fine for you. But it is crucial that you be honest with yourself. \n\n\\*Indeed, there are probably many learners who are already in maintenance mode, but haven't recognized it yet: a \"break\" that has lasted for six months and counting; putting in the absolute minimum after a year of diligence--their time limit was one year!\n\n\\*\\*I'm referring to the average learner. I know that there are learners who have persevered for seven years straight, etc. It's also possible for enough time to pass that you can restart it as a new active project.",

        "text": "Hi there,\n\nI was born to Turkish parents who migrated to Europe. Thus I speak some Turkish, but it isn't really great. Turkish is also not the main language I communicate in with my parents; they belong to an ethnic minority of which I do speak the language. So Turkish was only the language of my parents country to me, not their language, not my language.\n\nNow I want to master Turkish, since I think it is a language that is comparably easy for me to pick up. I am not saying that it is super easy or anything. But if I think about the process of learning languages, I have the big advantage of not having to go through the basics anymore. I am able to have basic conversations, I can name countries, animals, vegetables etc. Of course there are some deficits. For example I never bothered to memorize the names of weekdays, but that is something I can do now.  \n\n\n**I cannot give a clear assessment of my current level, but here is what I think:**\n\n* I can understand the grammar very well. I did an online-placement test and got C1. Of course I do not assume to have a C1 level, but it does speak to some degree for my level of grammar.\n* I have a mediocre passive vocabulary; I never speak Turkish myself, so my active vocabulary is rather bad.\n* I think my biggest deficit is vocabulary in general. Then comes the lacking practice. \n* I never got to learn Turkish in a proper way. Most of my knowledge comes from doing holidays in the country (still amazes me, how fast children can learn languages).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now my question for you guys:**\n\nHow hard do you think the road ahead will be for me? Will it really be easier to learn Turkish for me? Or will my fragmentary knowledge be a hindrance in the end?\n\nHow should I go about to handle this task? Any tips? I think one advantage I have is that I can ask my parents to speak in Turkish with me in the foreseeable future.",

Wealthy countries with good education + same language family as English\n\nTier 3: Romance languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese and Italian, *especially* French). Due to significant lexical similarity with English and somewhat similar grammatical structures\n\nTier 4: Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, etc). Small lexical similarity with English, and Indo-European grammar.\n\nTier 5: Indo-Iranian languages (Hindi, Urdu, etc). Heavy incentive to learn English + Still Indo-European.\n\nTier 6: Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin, Cantonese, etc). Chinese are learning English en masse and China does a lot of business with the world\n\nIf you'd like to add more tiers or to change a language family's classification within this list, feel free to do so.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10pa3v4/am_i_drawing_a_false_distinction_between_academic/",
        "text": "  **TL;DR:** *I‚Äôm looking for a language program (Russian) that treats the subject like a ‚Äòregular‚Äô class subject, not as a vehicle to QUICKLY and WITHOUT ANY EFFORT get by in a tourist situation. I could be wrong about my perceptions, but everything I‚Äôm finding seems focused on the latter. Am I wrong about my perceptions and preferences? If not, can you suggest a program?*   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  The few programs we‚Äôve tried over the past few months seem, for lack of a better word, ‚Äòconversational‚Äô in their approach. No vocabulary lists, mainly just a series of phrases in different situations. There‚Äôs no apparent (to us) approach to language mechanics, as in no using each verb or phrase as its related to I/we/she/he/them/us/etc., noun/adjective order, focus on gender and how it relates to verbs, tenses and so on. I realize some of this might be a bit much for the first few months, but although some of it has been obliquely mentioned, I‚Äôm not seeing it as an upcoming focus.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  They seem, to me, to lack rigor in terms of deep learning a language. To draw an analogy, it‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre teaching guitar by focusing on songs with only casual mention of scales, chord structure, intervals, etc. I realize that both songs and theory are important, but these programs seem to focus far too heavily on the former. (I should say I also realize that learning guitar by learning songs is perfectly fine and doable, it‚Äôs just not the balance I‚Äôm looking for.)   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  I‚Äôd like to find an interactive course with a  more ‚Äòacademic‚Äô bent to it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be boring per se, I mean one that presents vocabulary lists with a goal of using the large volume of words to introduce language concepts. As in (and this is just an example of the top of my head) a unit with a hundred household items, fifty adjectives (e.g. colors, materials) and fifty verbs. The words are doled out over the unit‚Äôs weeks and used to teach sentence construction (e.g. a *subject verbs the adjective noun to object* kind of thing). Maybe with a  pseudo syllabus to help with pacing.    \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  I think the contrasting outcome I‚Äôm imagining isn‚Äôt being able to go on vacation to a particular country, but to eventually be able to fairly easily test out of language 101 or 102 in a college.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  I guess inherent to the OP question is whether I‚Äôm drawing a false distinction between the two. I lack formal educational training, so could be stuck in a ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs how *I* learned!‚Äù bias and unfairly discounting what I‚Äôm calling the conversational approach (or imagining a distinction where there is none).   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  If there is a distinction, can anyone help me cut through the myriad language programs and suggest a few names that we should look at? Given the long-term value, it doesn‚Äôt have to be necessarily free, but budgets being tight we don‚Äôt have a lot in the way of resources.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  Thanks for any insight or guidance!    \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp; \n\n  I put the background down here in case it‚Äôs important. Long story short, our son‚Äôs middle school cancelled the language program due staffing shortages. He now has a study hall in its place, so there‚Äôs time to do this without infringing on home gaming/building/whatever time. We want to find a self-paced course that fits into that slot (or a little at home, depending on his choices) four to five times a week. The intended language is Russian, his late mother‚Äôs native language; the choice is very much in memory of her and to make his grandparents happy. The true goal isn‚Äôt to pass xyz in college, it‚Äôs to be able to some day freely converse with them.",

Just assume I already have exquisite time management skills.",
