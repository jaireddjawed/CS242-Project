To whit,  he has discussed his [Mars colonization](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elon-musk-publishes-plans-for-colonizing-mars/) ambitions as [part-and-parcel](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/elon-musk-colonize-mars/) with his somewhat cataclysmic view of how AI will manifest itself in the future:\n\n&gt;Musk’s alarming views on the dangers of A.I. first went viral after he spoke at M.I.T. in 2014—speculating (pre-Trump) that A.I. was probably humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” He added that he was increasingly inclined to think there should be some national or international regulatory oversight—anathema to Silicon Valley—“to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” He went on: “With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon. You know all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he’s like, yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.” Some A.I. engineers found Musk’s theatricality so absurdly amusing that they began echoing it. When they would return to the lab after a break, they’d say, “O.K., let’s get back to work summoning.”\n\nI'd like to set [parameters](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Teachers/riskuncertainty.html) for this conversation by distinguishing between *risk* and *uncertainty*:\n\n&gt;**[Risk]** is present when future events occur with measurable probability\n&gt;\n&gt;**[Uncertainty]** is present when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable\n\nI'm doing this because, while I appreciate the possibility that machines could learn to do bad things or have unintended consequences, I'd like to stay away from the realm of Killer Robot Santa unless we have a data set to extrapolate there.\n\nBearing this framework in mind:\n\n1. What risks does AI pose to humanity, whether our well-being or more pedestrian issues like job transformations and mechanical snafus?\n\n2. What data do we have to determine these are risks and not simply uncertainties?\n\n3. How can we use this data to consider if government responses (e.g., regulation, investment, criminalization) to these risks are appropriate, and what might those solutions be?",

For a couple of reasons, the article says, this is bad. First of all, it claims that most of the money goes to big, wealthy farms and and not small ones. Second, it says that although a 2014 bill prevented direct payments and supposedly eliminated money going to farmers who don't farm at all, there will still be plentiful agricultural *insurance* subsidies and others tied to price, and that non-farmers will find new ways to access the subsidies. \n\nIn addition to that article, a *Time* magazine [article](http://time.com/4393109/food-subsidies-obesity/) claims that by making crops like corn and soy so cheap and plentiful, the government is contributing to the American obesity epidemic. Despite the fact that the government does not recommend the consumption of products such as high-fructose corn syrup, that is often what subsidized corn is processed into. A study cited in the article says that\n&gt;Compared to people who ate the least amount of subsidized food, the people who ate the most had a 37% higher risk of being obese, a 41% greater risk of having belly fat, a 34% higher risk for having signs of elevated inflammation and a 14% higher risk of having abnormal cholesterol.\n\nHave corn subsidies made Americans unhealthier?\n\nFinally, on a more global scale, a *New York Times* [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/world/americas/mexico-donald-trump-nafta.html) from 2004 suggests that the negative effects of NAFTA on Mexico's corn industry were linked to the subsidization of agriculture in the US. Nearly two million jobs were lost in the Mexican agricultural industry due to trade competition. Was this negative economic effect exacerbated by agricultural subsidies?\n",

Graham and Booker](https://www.scribd.com/document/355454481/Special-Counsel-Independence-Protection-Act) would require pre-emptive judicial review of any removal of a special counsel.\n\nThe second, introduced by [Sens.

On balance, labor cartels harm the economy, and enacting policies designed to force workers into unions will only prolong the recession.\n\n---\n\nSince these two viewpoints seem to contradict each other, I'm interested in historical examples: how strong are union laws in each US state, and how have these laws affected their economy and standards of living? \n\nDid states with weak unions recover from the recession faster than states with strong unions?",
