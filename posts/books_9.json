Before Lolita I read Kafka - Die Verwandlung and Friedrich Schiller - Kabale und Liebe and now I started with Lolita (I’m on page 161). The problem is that I don’t really see why people say the linguistic of the Book is so amazing (probably because of the lack of my knowledge.) Would you say I should stop reading the Book and read more easier Books and after some time I should start again with Lolita? I really don’t want that the “magic” of the Book goes away if I read it now.",

        "text": "A throwback thriller from the 1970's era. These were the years when espionage thrillers that span the globe in their story coverage were the norm in books and movies. I am not talking about the James Bond type of spy novels. Nor the Le Carre with his slow almost sluggish British sense of importance. Forsyth's style was a mix of real world events and fictional characters that made  the readers question if the characters are in fact real life people.\n\nI remember picking up a paperback copy in a bookstore on its discounted table. It was with the sickle and SR-71 plane on the cover. I was maybe 12 years old then. I was starting to like books instead of sports. My weekends would be spent in bed reading instead of playing football or basketball. I suck at sports. \n\nI remember the letters were small and it made reading hard. So hard that I think it took me a couple of years to finish the book. Every time I had to reread from the start because I forgot the characters. And there were a lot of characters in that book. A political thriller about Russian wheat production. How could you spin a yarn about it and make it interesting? Don't know. But Forsyth pulled it off. It was I think my first novel where several plots that seem not connected were pulled together in the end. And like most of Forsyth's early novels, the twist in the end was cleverly revealed in the last few pages. \n\nForsyth may have retired (not sure) or have slowed down in his writing. His last few stories did not have that 70's sophistication in my opinion. Or maybe my tastes in books have changed. I really hope that he continues writing with his style of intertwining real world political events and how ordinary individuals are swooped into the storm.",

It’s a tiny hole in the wall with maybe 25 bookshelves. \n\nThe owner of the store seems to pride himself on his curation of what goes on his shelves. He also hand-picks employees that read a lot and it’s clear that every single book in that store has been read and recommended by at least one person on his staff.\n\nI can easily drop €100 there and enjoy almost everything I pick up. I feel like I always get my money’s worth. They’re also always getting new books in and rotating what’s available so there’s always something new.\n\nI also know that people travel to get to this place even though it’s in a medium-sized city.\n\nI really think you can make a tiny book store work. Clearly it’s a labor of love, but I’ll take that over a Barnes &amp; Noble or Waterstones any day.",

But I digress. This novel, published in 1971, it became an enormous sensation and a big seller. The contents of it had taken readers by surprise during that time. The story of demonic possession is delivered in a visceral way, much more so than Ray Russell's \"The Case Against Satan\".\n\nThis is the layout of the plot, Actress Chris MacNeil begins hearing strange noises in the house she shares with two housekeepers and her daughter, and then gradually she begins to see changes in her daughter. Some very frightening changes.\n\nShe takes her to various doctors when these changes intensifies and gets not answers as to what may be wrong with her daughter, she has one hope left. An Exorcism.\n\nLike I've said before this was a very intense novel. Later it was adapted to film and released on an unsuspecting world and its screenplay was even written by Blatty himself. And it has become recognized as one of the greatest horror movie of all time, and since then nothing like it has even topped before or since.",

The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”\n\n\\[*The Silver Key;* Pg. 160\\] “In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers, for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted…”\n\n\\[*The Silver Key;* Pg. 161\\] \"They did not know that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and culture.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **\\[Derivative&amp;Origin\\] Edgar Allen Poe**\n\n\\[*Berenice*; Pg. 141\\] “But, as in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day, or the agonies which *are,* have their origin in the ecstasies which *might have been.*”\n\n\\[*The Mystery of Marie Rogêt;* Pg. 211\\] “We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation—to make a point—than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former.”\n\n\\[*The Premature Burial;* Pg. 243\\] “The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?”\n\n(Note: the \"silver cord\" means the persons life-thread that connects to their \"higher self\", but it is also a metaphor for the spine of a human, and the \"golden bowl\" refers to the skull and brain, the consciousness of the person or spirit)\n\n\\[*The Premature Burial;* Pg. 254\\] \"There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of Hell—but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful—but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us—they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.\"\n\n(Note: I know it may come off as some \"edgy\" quote because of the \"semblance of Hell,\" but what it is talking about is people's fear and \"demons\" overtaking their lives to the point of physically harming them. That's why he says, \"they must sleep, or they will devour us...\")\n\n\\[*The Purloined Letter;* Pg. 283\\] \"'And the identification,' I said, 'of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.'\" \n\n(Note: to analyze and gauge the opponent's intellect for the benefit of one's own solution or action. Meaning that, if the opponent is of a simple intellect then one's response to their question or action shouldn't be outside their ability of thought or limited to an area below it. Of course, this is in the context of solving a case, and not providing thorough explanation to someone's question because of their level of intellect is not the meaning. The idea is to use it as a detecting or guessing device where by assessing the object one will narrow down or completely hit upon the answer.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if my explanations were unconcise or drawn out unnecessarily, I attribute that to the only thing Highschool English has taught me: string along a sentence or point for as long as possible and with much filler.",

The appearance of the family at the end of the story leaves me with a large question. \n\nLooking at this from the stance that 1) this family is real and 2) they aren’t cannibals (obviously debatable, but let’s say this is the case for the sake of this question), then . . . \n\nWhy wouldn’t they have approached the man &amp; boy sooner if they were following them for the sake of the boy? In this world, would it not be better to approach both the man and the boy to create a larger, strong family unit? \n\nThe father was sick and wounded, but still had resources, skills and so forth. \n\nWhile you could argue they saw the man as a threat, the man whom the boy meets at the end has a shotgun - definitely enough to hold his own against his father’s pistol. \n\nFor purposes of preserving humanity, if we believe this is what the family unit would like to accomplish, would it not make sense to have the grown man to procreate with the mother and the younger boy to procreate with the younger girl when they came of age to do so? \n\nOf course, the man was visibly sick, but it feels like such a waste of time and resources to track the duo for so long just to wait for the man to die and approach the boy . . . \n\nIt doesn’t add up to me. There is the idea this family is a metaphor, where the boy meets himself as an adult, or that they are cannibals (if this is the case, the same problem stands - why spend so much time &amp; resources following them when the threat (the boy’s father) could be taken out with a shotgun, as he was already weak and wounded). \n\nThoughts?",

I gotta get them books that interest them and that have enough chapters that it can last like 2 months. They like similar books that I like just dont quite have that reading level yet. So for example their older brother (9) is reading books after I read them and has been on a Brandon Sanderson run for a year. I dont quite think they are ready for that and we have stuff like city of ember which I dont think they are quite ready for.  \n\n\nI was looking at getting them books and all the 1st/2nd grade or 6yo (they will be 7 in 2 months) reading level books are basically pamphlets that the entirety could be read in about 15 minutes. Are there no books for that age group that meet my description? Or are there fantasy series out there with a low reading level requirement?   \n\n\nAny help would be appreciated keep in mind since I have twins im not trying to spend $50 a week on books I prefer each book last at least a month.

        "text": "In 1961, the Russian author, Vladimir Nabokov, wrote a novel titled \"Pale Fire.\" This novel is a unique work of literature, not just because of its experimental structure but also because it's a story about a person writing a story about a person writing a story.\n\nThe novel consists of a 999-line poem titled \"Pale Fire\" and a commentary on the poem by a man named Charles Kinbote. The poem is written by a fictional poet named John Shade, who has recently died. Kinbote claims to be Shade's friend and editor, and his commentary is an attempt to explain the poem and its meaning.\n\nHowever, as the reader progresses through the novel, it becomes clear that Kinbote is an unreliable narrator, and his commentary is actually a story about his own life, not Shade's poem. He weaves a complex tale of his life as the exiled king of a fictional country called Zembla, and how he came to be in the United States.\n\nThroughout the novel, Nabokov skillfully blurs the line between reality and fiction, making it difficult for the reader to discern what is true and what is not. The novel is filled with puzzles and riddles, forcing the reader to actively engage with the text and try to piece together the narrative.\n\nNabokov's \"Pale Fire\" is a masterful work of literature, pushing the boundaries of what a novel can be. It's a story about a person writing a story about a person writing a story, but it's also much more than that. It's a meditation on the nature of reality, truth, and the power of language to shape our understanding of the world.",

Also, manga/anime Kingdom comes to mind. (thinking of manga/anime, Vinland Saga is also good for a viking description)\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nSo what would be the Western equivalent of  'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'? (has good balance between being history and fiction, between politics and war, between focusing on characters and events/war) \n\n(pre World war 1 or 2 would be good)\n\n\\-----\n\nAlthough not historical, A Song of Ice and Fire comes to mind with the characters, politics and the countries. \n\nIliad (and such like the Song of Achilles) also with it's Trojan war, but could have more politics or more scale.\n\nPlutarchus's 'Parallel lives' with the description of Roman politicians, Punic War and Alexander the Great is good but split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nSo are there any good books with this concept?",
