        "text": "Some of you might be familiar with the anarcho-capitalist \"philosopher\" Hans-Herman Hoppe. \n\nThe errors of Hoppe are too many to go into, but one of the most hilarious claims he makes is that monarchy is more suitable than democracy from a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist perspective:\n\n&gt;A king owned the territory and could hand it on to his son, and thus tried to preserve its value. A democratic ruler was and is a temporary caretaker and thus tries to maximize current government income of all sorts at the expense of capital values, and thus wastes.\n\n&gt;Here are some of the consequences: during the monarchical age before World War I, government expenditure as a percent of GNP was rarely higher than 5%. Since then it has typically risen to around 50%. Prior to World War I, government employment was typically less than 3% of total employment. Since then it has increased to between 15 and 20%. The monarchical age was characterized by a commodity money (gold) and the purchasing power of money gradually increased. In contrast, the democratic age is the age of paper money whose purchasing power has permanently decreased.  (Natural Elites, Intellectuals and the State)\n\nThis is, of course, all nonsense. And I can provide a few good examples.\n\nFirst off, the fact that kings owned territory as their private property does not mean that they were more likely to maximise its value. In fact, the fact that they lacked accountability to anyone meant that they didn't have to be responsible with the country's finances.\n\nLet's look at Richard the Lionheart, who barely lived in his kingdom and spent all his time waging wars in the Middle East and spending the country's money on Crusades. When his much maligned brother, John, took power after his brother got himself killed in France, the kingdom was virtually broke, forcing John to resort to all sorts of dubious measures in order to replenish the coffers, which did not make him popular with his subjects, hence John's bad reputation in the history books. Richard had no legitimate children, and so had little incentive to preserve its value as Hans-Herman Hoppe claims. But it's unlikely that even if he had had legitimate children, it's unlikely he would have ceased his wasteful wamongering. Thanks to Richard's incompetence, John had to impose evil, un-libertarian \"statist\" measures to make up for it. It's unlikely that Mr. Hoppe would have approved.\n\nLet's have a look at Henry VIII, whose breach with Rome and the subsequent Reformation led to massive socio-economic disruption and religious chaos of the type England had never seen and would never see again. All because he wanted to divorce his wife. He also wasted huge sums of money on wars with France. All of the wealth his father, Henry VII, had carefully saved up during his reign was used up on futile foreign expeditions which gained the country nothing. All this was exacerbated by the religious turmoil Henry brought about with his decision to form his own church.\n\n(Also let's remember that the Tudors helped to abolish feudalism in England, reducing the power of the nobility severely and extending the power of the central government, making it easier for property to be taxed, or \"stolen\" as Hoppe would see it.)\n\nLet's have a look at James I of England, who in 1614 sponsored a crazy scheme by a merchant named Sir William Cockayne to take over the finished cloth trade from the Netherlands. The gambit failed and the cloth trade in England collapsed, causing massive unemployment. The Merchant Adventurers, who had initially had their monopoly revoked by the king, never recovered from Cockayne's stupid plan. James was also infamous for his spending habits. During his reign, the royal debt shot up to £1 million. Between 1603 and 1612, James spent £185,000 on jewels. He lavished money on his favourite, Buckingham, with whom he had a homosexual relationship. His officials, like Suffolk, the Lord Treasurer, were blatantly corrupt. He rejected a proposal known as the Great Contract, which would have seen him give up some of his feudal privileges in return for a regular income from parliament - £600,000 as a one-off measure to pay off his debt, and subsequently £200,000 a year. His son, Charles, ended up adopting similar measures to those which had gotten King John in trouble centuries before, collecting taxes without parliamentary approval and violating property rights in order to balance the books. The result was a civil war and Charles' execution, then the abolition of the monarchy and 11 years of republican rule.\n\nAnd these are just English kings. I'm sure there'd be similar examples from the European continent. But this just points to the sloppy research which went into Hoppe's sorry excuse for a book. It's quite clear that monarchies were *not* less wasteful or more respectful of property rights than are modern liberal democracies, as Hoppe idiotically asserts.\n\nAll in all, this individual should not be taken seriously by anyone.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6lj9l8/til_taoism_john_galt/",
        "text": "I mentioned stumbling on this in one of the weekly threads awhile back and finally got around to researching it a bit.  No man should see the horrors I have seen, lads.\n\n**Background** \n\nThe *Dao De Jing* is a short work of philosophy from the Warring States period in ancient China, roughly 4th century BCE.  The words translate as Dao = \"way\", de = \"virtue\" or \"power\", Jing (in this context) = \"great book\" or \"classic book.\"  So the name translated means, roughly, \"Great Book of the Way.\"\n\nThe whole text is not very long, and can be read in its entirety in translation [here](http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing).\n\n**How is this like Confucianism or Buddhism?**\n\nThe Chinese called Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism the \"three teachings\" (the DDJ and Confucianism were contemporaries while Buddhism came to the region a few centuries later).  Buddhism is religion, Confucianism is behavior/ethics, and Taoism is philosophy. There were debates among Taoists about whether this should only be philosophy or also a competing religion.  There was at least one 'schism' in the few centuries after its origin.  All of that is beyond the scope of this post but google should turn up plenty if you care to read more.\n\nOur emphasis is not on the 'three teachings' but on the 'three libertarian hacks'.  The first would be William Marina, shill of the Mises Institute and history professor at Florida Atlantic University who wrote [this](https://mises.org/library/capitalism-and-tao) in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; Even closer to individualist thinking is Taoism, formed by Lao Tzu, a contemporary of Confucius. He taught that individual happiness is the basis of a good society. He saw the state, with its \"laws and regulations more numerous than the hairs of an ox,\" as the persistent oppressor of the individual, \"more to be feared than fierce tigers.\" He was an opponent of taxation and war, and his students and the tradition that followed him were consistently libertarian.\n\nI'm gonna stop you right there, Pinochet.  The state was a moving target when the DDJ was written.  It isn't called the \"warring states\" period for nothing.  At least ten different regions/factions were at war for territory in what we know as China during this period of history.  Eventually all fell to the Qin region and thus began the Qin dynasty/first Chinese empire in the 2nd century. The portions of the DDJ that deal with the concept of 'princely behavior' must be seen in that context.  There are ten potential enemies, striking out at one leaves one vulnerable to another.  Thus, the DDJ is effectively a philosophy advocating peace rather than war.  Nothingness in most of its examples is in the context of \"not fighting\" or \"not plotting against your enemies\" or \"not doing something wrong.\" It has nothing to do with the individualism of any western ideology.\n\n*24- He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Dao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Dao do not adopt and allow them.*\n\nThe above is not a glorification of individualism.  It is an advocacy for quiet contemplation and humility, which are not very Ayn Rand.\n\nNumber two in our list of the three little teapots is Ken McCormick, economics professor at the University of Northern Iowa when he wrote [\"The Tao of Laissez-Faire\"](http://web.holycross.edu/RePEc/eej/Archive/Volume25/V25N3P331_341.pdf) in 1999. Here we get to the traditional libertarian pastime of misreading Adam Smith, blended with misreading someone else, to form a completely baseless conclusion.\n\n&gt; The fact that both Smith and the Taoists do not think that wealth brings contentment does not change the fact that neither one advocates a policy to stop people from doing what they want.\n\n**DDJ:**\n\n*81- (The manifestation of simplicity) Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Dao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Dao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.*\n\n*3- (Keeping the people at rest) Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal.*\n\nSounds pretty socialist to me, but then again, so does....\n\n**Adam Smith, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\"**\n\n*The wise and virtuous man is at all times willing that his own private interest should be sacrificed to the public interest of his own particular order or society. He is at all times willing too, that the interest of this order or society should be sacrificed to the greater interest of the state or sovereignty of which it is only a subordinate part: he should, therefore, be equally willing that all those inferior interests should be sacrificed to the greater good of the universe, to the interest of that great society of all sensible and intelligent beings, of which God himself is the immediate administrator and director.*\n\nAnd most recently we come to James Dorn, mouthpiece of the ~~Koch~~ errr... Cato Institute. [\"The Tao of Adam Smith\"](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/tao-adam-smith) is cited by someone else as written in 2003, although this link has no date on it.  Here, we're going to get into flat out fabrication...\n\n&gt; In the Tao Te Ching, written more than 2,000 years before Smith’s “Wealth of Nations,” Lao Tzu instructed the sage-ruler to adopt the principle of noninterference as the best way to achieve happiness and prosperity: “Take no action and the people of themselves are transformed … Engage in no activity and the people of themselves become prosperous.” He recognized that “the more laws and orders are made prominent, the more thieves and robbers there will be.”\n\nThere are two mentions of \"robbers\" in the DDJ in this context, here they are without Cato edits...\n\n*19- (Returning to the unadulterated influence) If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. Those three methods (of government). Thought olden ways in elegance did fail. And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true. Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.*\n\n*57 (The genuine influence) A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. How do I know that it is so? By these facts: - In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.*\n\nAs you can see this is getting marginally more complex, we progress from the period of Warring States to the period of Clinton, to the period of crusty old ideologues having internet access, but the DDJ's context of \"simplicity\" and \"inaction\" is referring to a state of being in harmony with nature, our Cato friends seem to have missed the part where the goal is \"primitive simplicity\" free of \"selfish ends and many lusts.\"\n\nI can't take credit for being the first to find and debunk this horseshit.  The credit from my searching goes to...\n\n\"Wu Wei East and West\" by Eric Goodfield. *Theoria.* March 2011. doi:10.3167/th.2011.5812603\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/41802494?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\n\"Do Daoist Principles Justify Laissez-Faire Policies?\" by Silja Grapue, *International Journal for Field Briefing.* Vol 6, No. 1, 2007. http://www.silja-graupe.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/silja_graupe_daoist_principles_laissez_faire_2011.pdf\n\nThanks to /u/voorface for edits/clarifications.\n\nThere are several more journal articles debunking these modern political claims from a purely philosophical standpoint, but again those are beyond the scope of this post. Most deal with the common issue of language; the dao is seen as above god, an essence that cannot be described, hence its ever-shifting translations. The typical German/French names that have issues with the philosophy of language have written on Taoism in this context quite a bit, going back to the 19th century.  However this is also a basic incompatibility between Taoism and Laissze-Faire by Adam Smith, as Graupe points out, because Adam Smith defines 'order' in a Christian context, and Taoism sees a force above god.  In Taoism god is the creator of the world's inhabitants, but the dao is the order of the entire universe, a higher power than god that cannot be named.  See below... (bonus: more anti-greed and anti-individualism).\n\n*1- (Embodying the Dao) The Dao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Dao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.*",

I doubt the hunter-gatherer nomads who showed up in *what would become* Finland saw themselves as \"Finns\". You might as well claim that the Peking man founded China.\n\n&gt; Ancient texts talk about Finnish history as far back as ancient texts go. \n\nUh, what? Again I get what he means, but this is one hell of a poorly expressed sentence. \"As far back as ancient texts go?\" Last time I checked there were no Finns in the epic of Gilgamesh.\n\n&gt; The name Finland existed as far back as the 11th century when it was carved on the Runestone U582.\n\nWhat constituted \"Finland\" in the Viking age has been the subject of fierce debate. It's fairly well agreed upon that when Snorri Sturlasson talked about \"Finns\" he actually meant Sami. The Finland as we know it today was split into various groups in those days with the Tavastians as arguably the strongest and most powerful one among them. It is possible that these groups (i don't want to say, tribes, as I don't really know the definition, and I know it's a berserk button for you guys) were at some point united under a high king, but we just don't know anything about that. Furthermore, Runestone U582 is not in existence anymore. It was discovered in the 17th century but has since been lost. I don't doubt that it says what it says, but it's still impossible for us to make any new discoveries regarding it since well, it's gone. \n\n&gt; The early Finnish wars took place in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThere are some poorly sourced stories about the Republic of Novgorod being [at war with a people called the \"Yem\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish%E2%80%93Novgorodian_wars) which was probably the Russian name for the Tavastians. [The Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish%E2%80%93Novgorodian_Wars) are much better sourced and were primarily fought over who had control of Tavastia. It should be noted that when Tavastia finally got conquered by the Swedes in 1249, the area known as \"proper Finland\" (modern southwest Finland, where the city of Turku is) had already been Swedish property since far earlier (how far we don't know, but traditionally since at least before the Battle of the Neva.) To call these \"Finnish wars\" is... technically true, but requires a whopping amount of good will. The first proper \"Finnish war\" in my book would be the [Cudgel War of 1596]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudgel_War) since it was basically a conflict between the Finnish Nobility and Peasantry with little real Swedish involvement.\n\nR5: Tons of semi-true, greatly exaggerated, or just plain untrue statements made about Finnish history. \n\n ",

        "text": "So I was browsing the comments of a ['Crusader Memes'](http://imgur.com/gallery/tO2e9) post on Imgur because I hate myself and I came across a comment saying:\n\n&gt; Fun fact the Byzantines convinced the pope to start the crusades just so they could have access to the silk road.\n\nwhich is just... I mean... let's just take a look.\n\n&gt; Fun fact\n\nThis sentence is neither fun nor a fact.\n\n&gt; the Byzantines convinced the pope\n\nI would hardly say the Byzantines 'convinced' anybody.  They requested assistance, it's not like they were trying to trick Pope Urban II into something.  If I ask someone to help me move my couch and they agree I haven't 'convinced' them to move my couch.\n\n&gt; to start the crusades\n\nThis bit is wrong for a couple of reasons.  Firstly; the Byzantines were not looking for an expedition on the scale of the first crusade, it's more likely that they wanted a smaller group of Frankish soldiers who would provide assistance but still be basically bound to the Byzantine cause.  Urban II decided to take the opportunity to transform the expedition into what would eventually be called the First Crusade.  Second, they weren't intending this to be a repeated event so the plural would be incorrect even if it was applied to a more accurate word.  Even the Pope at the time was not trying to start 'the crusades' (doubly so because the name 'crusades' wouldn't come around until much later but that's a minor point) he was planning a single event.\n\n&gt; just so they could have access to the silk road.\n\nI can't find any source claiming the Byzantine empire ever lost access to the silk road and Europe had had access to the Silk Road since at least the time of the Roman Empire, possibly earlier.  Even if they had needed access to the Silk Road the goal of the Byzantines was to reclaim lost territory in Anatolia and hopefully stem Seljuk aggression.  As the Silk Road ran through the Levant and then across the Mediterranean to Constantinople and Italy (as seen [here](http://www.ancient.eu/img/r/p/750x750/146.png?v=1485680513)) none of the territory the Byzantines wanted to reclaim would have in any way affected this.\n\nBonus comments:\n\n&gt; And yes, all crusaders have been fought and been defeated by armies of great Salah ud din.\n\nSaladin is associated pretty specifically with the Third Crusade and would not have fought any armies of the other crusades as far as I can remember.\n\n&gt; so is there someone with a full templar outfit that just remakes memes? neat\n\nThe image he is referring to is [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Ycv5qA1.gifv) or any of the similar ones and that is not a Templar outfit, or even any of the military orders as far as I can tell.  The Templars wore white cloth with a red cross, the Hospitalers wore black cloth with a white cross, and the Teutonic Knights wore white cloth with a black cross.  The person in the gif doesn't even have a cross on their tabard and it's quartered in black and white.\n\nSource: *The Crusades* by Thomas Asbridge",

The lack of trench warfare makes it seem like the entirety of the First World War was just massive, epic battles, but does not show all aspects of the war. \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is this. Will the historical inaccuracies in these games teach the next generation this history? Will they believe that these were the true events of the war and the aspects of the wars? Or will school still teach true history (or what we know today)?!\n\nI just want to say that I'm not trying to racially or sexistly(?) trigger anyone. I'm genuinely curious! It's the fact that seeing a Black, Female, German soldier running about the battlefield is making a lot of people upset. \n\nThanks in advance! ",

It discusses the German artist Anselm Kiefer back when he announced a series of works dedicated to the Russian futurist poet Velimir Khlebnikov. Naturally, some bad history was to be expected.\n\n&gt; Khlebnikov - to use the English rather than German transliteration of this somewhat obscure Russian's name\n\nObscure to whom? It's a very straight-forward Slavic last name that takes a Slavic root for bread — *khleb*. It's not as common as Smith, but about that simple.\n\n&gt; Khlebnikov was a poet and founder of Russian futurism\n\nKhlebnikov was in no way a founder of Russian futurism — that title goes to Igor Severyanin. Being a rather strange human being, probably incapable of any kind of organization, Khlebnikov never really founded anything — despite him being hugely influential as an avant-garde poet.\n\n&gt; One of his several improbable and faintly ludicrous ideas was that he wished to purify the Russian language, ridding it of its western elements; he came to write his own poems in this invented language\n\nThe former half is true, but it has no connection with the latter half. Khlebnikov did not write in any kind of invented language — primarily because Zaum is not a language, but a method of linguistic experimentation, incorporating words from no language at all, bearing no assigned meaning — merely sounds that are suggestive of movement or a visual flow. And Khlebnikov didn't even use it that much, he's just the only one of the group who did it well. You may think I'm splitting hairs here, but a Russian avant-garde poet could probably shoot you dead over this.\n\n&gt; This sort of thing is infinitely tiresome...\n\nI'd like a source for that, please.\n\n&gt; ...as undoubtedly was this ridiculous magus - whose origins lay in an obscure, nomadic Buddhist tribe.\n\nOh for the love of... What is it that they have with word 'obscure'? Anyway, I don't even know what the hell do they even mean here. Khlebnikov was inspired by many of the Asian peoples living in Russia, but why does it have to be phrased in this 'hurrah for Eurocentric exoticism' format? \n\n&gt; The President of Planet Earth\n\nChairman. Chairman of the Planet Earth. You'd think for somebody that important, they'd properly translate the title.\n\n&gt; Talking last week at White Cube, Kiefer happily admitted that Khlebnikov's ideas were \"complete nonsense\"\n\nWELL EXCUSE ME.\n\nOn a more serious note, Khlebnikov may have seen literally insane, but he did predict the year of the Russian Revolution 10 years before it happened.\n\nAnyway. Here's a poem for y'all.\n\n***\n\nThe naked freedom is coming\n\nCasting flowers on our hearts\n\nAnd, keeping in step, with heaven\n\nWe talk, having equal rights.\n\nWe, soldiers, will strike in a strict way\n\nAt stern shields with our hands:\n\nLet the people become the king now,\n\nForever, in all lands!\n\nLet maidens sing at the windows\n\nAmid the songs of the ancient campaign\n\nAbout the Sun’s true people – The autocratic men.",

As there is audio evidence of it, criticism of the historical existence of the conference is basically limited to conspiracy theorists and Holocaust deniers, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this, I suppose, as not everyone has studied the history of the Holocaust enough to have heard of it.\n\nSpeaking now of the first camps and how they were different from camps created to exterminate \"undesirables\":\n[\nThe first camps were for political prisoners and did not include liquidation of those interned](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005263). If the Holocaust museum is not a good source, then I think you can probably safely say the person you're talking to is a little crazy. Forced labor, existed, yes, and they rounded up communists and others who spoke out against the Nazi regime, but Auschwitz this was not. People also died in these camps, but it was almost entirely due to being malnourished, disease, and the hardship of forced labor. To say that there is no break between 1933 and 1942 after Wannsee because something called a concentration camp existed and people died in them in both periods is the height of ignorance with regards to this subject.\n\nAnd of course, on the last note, we see that acknowledging the existence of a final solution which was primarily concerned with the elimination of the Jews is the result of \"Jewish horseshit\". You will be delighted to know that that link was not to an academic paper refuting said horseshit, but was instead a link to [this](https://gyazo.com/c3a51c8d53bd39c0f34214aecb97790b). How this refutes anything I said, I don't know; there is no mention of them being liquidated, and all of it is history that is verifiable and which I agree with. I'm not sure why they added it.\n\n\nBonus: They replied with some other good stuff - [here is their reply](http://i.imgur.com/rNl5d4n.png)\n\nShould be noted, of course, that they provided no links and seem incredibly obtuse with regards to what we were talking about. The last bit is some mistaken identity where they thought I was someone else who accused them of being a Holocaust denier, and they seem to still not be able to figure that out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this person a Holocaust denier? I don't think they are. They stated that they interviewed a Holocaust survivor in an earlier comment who wasn't Jewish, and seem to think this negates Jews being the primary victims of the Holocaust. Basically, I think they might just be an idiot. A very confrontational idiot.",

Some estimates go up as high as 40,000, but these are really estimates for the population of the entire American Bottom and not the 'city' itself. Per [this AskHistorians post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1vi1wl/what_were_the_largest_population_centers_in/), 20,000 during its early 13Th-century height is a good guess. \n\nSome cities in the period around 1200 that had more people than Cahokia:\n\n* **China**: in 1085 the census registered 200,000 households in **Hangzhou**, so around a million people. By 1200 the population would have been even larger because the Song Dynasty had relocated there in 1129. The population of **Kaifeng** was even higher, with the population density being something like 50,000 people per km^2 in the early 11th century (*The Age of Confucian Rule*, \"Transforming the Capitals\"). **Suzhou**, not even a capital, had 300,000 people. As for Quanzhou... well, you see the point. \n* **Western Europe**: In 1292 the French capital **Paris** was home to 59,200 people. South in **Venice** there were 80,000 people around 1200. \n* **Constantinople**: In 1204, just before the brutal crusader sack of the city, the Queen of Cities is estimated to have been home to some 250,000 people (*The Latin Renovatio of Byzantium*).\n* **Dar al-Islam**: In the 1340s, just before the Black Death, the Egyptian capital **Cairo** had 250,000~500,000 people. Other cities in Islamdom had similar numbers, like **Granada** (200,000~300,000), **Fez** (200,000 under the Almoravids), or **Baghdad** (200,000~1,000,000 people at its height, although quite smaller in 1200 due to Abbasid decline). \n* **India**: **Delhi** had 300,000 people in its 14th-century height (*Economic History of Medieval India*). \n\nSo Cahokia would have been a middling city in medieval western Europe and a small one in most of Asia. Certainly not one of the largest cities in the world. ",

        "text": "Hi. Long time reader, first time poster. For which reason I'm going to keep this short, and limit myself to just twenty words out of a single paragraph. But that small number of words may include the highest concentration of badhistory that I have ever encountered. It comes from Harrison Salisbury's *900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad* (1969). Here's the paragraph, the timeline being 1940-1941:\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the nationalist groups in Lithuania were the Union of Lithuanians, the Front of Lithuanian Activists and the Committee for Rescuing Lithuania. In Latvia they included the Perkinkrusts, and in Estonia the underground Legion of the East and the Committee of Rescue, otherwise known as the Izmailites and the Kaitzelites. Erna battalions to carry out diversions behind the lines of the Red Army.\n\nLet's walk through the bit about Estonia, because that's the one I know about. I suspect the Latvian and Lithuanian parts are just as wrong. Google tells me that Pērkonkrusts is misspelled, unsurprisingly, because:\n\nKaitzelites. This is a gibberish nonsense version of \"kaitseliit\", which translates to \"defence union\" and is and was a generic name for the Estonian military. It's not some special group, it's just a general expression. It's as underground and special as \"the army\".\n\nIzmailites. I have to disappoint you all. The Old Man of the Mountain *was not* in fact a freedom fighter for Estonia. This is another made up word. It took me a while to get what this was supposed to be. It's a gibberish nonsense version of \"isamaaliit\" (translates to \"Fatherland Union\"), a random political organization that functioned from 1935 to 1940. It was then disbanded, and I have no info of this random group being in any way underground or resistant-cy.\n\nBut this is the linguistic gibberish part. Surely the author simply didn't understand the language, and therefore this should have been posted at r/badlinguistics instead. But no!\n\nLegion of the East. No such thing has ever existed. There was an Estonian Legion during WWI, and there was also the Estonian SS Legion during WWII. Which was established in 1942, but more importantly, an SS legion is not what you would call \"underground\".\n\nCommittee for Rescue. In an amazing twist, we for the first time have a thing that *actually existed*. Well, kind of. I suppose it's an understandable translation of what is more commonly known as the Salvation Committee. This was a group of three people who laid the foundation for the newly minted Republic of Estonia. It existed as a political entity for all of five days, after which it transferred power to the first provisional government of Estonia. In 1918.\n\nSo that's four badhistories in 20 words. Must be some sort of a record.\n\nSources: I don't know how to provide proper sources for made up words and things that don't exist.",

In fact, the pike became one of the most widely respected weapons on the field.\n\nIn practice it was pikes which largely replaced halberds and other short polearms in the later middle ages. The had Swiss originally pioneered their deep shock formations to be made of phalanxes armed with halberds, but over time these became increasingly insufficient against heavy cavalry, the most notable instance being the Battle of Arbedo in 1422 where the Italian men-at-arms dismounted and routed the Swiss halberdiers using their lances as long spears. As a result the Swiss started incorporating 18 foot pikes into their formations and the proportion of pikemen would continue to increase over time. During the wars against Burgandy, the Swiss infantry proved capable of defeating more balanced \"combined arms\" armies that had far superior numbers of cavalry, archers, and handgunners. As a result of their successes, other nations started to hire them as mercenaries or copy their tactics starting in the late 15th century.\n\nThe method in which the Swiss used their pikes was hardly defensive, rather it typically involved rapidly advancing columns of pikemen being used as a battering ram to shatter an enemy army. A deep square or column 40-60 ranks deep was protected on all sides and could advance or maneuver much more easily than a long, thin line. The Swiss were also far from poorly trained, relying on a culture of almost constant drills and war games to let them retain their ranks while maneuvering and fight in their deep formations without crowding each other.\n\nThe Battle of Flodden in 1513, which the poster brings up, is largely an outlier when it comes to pikes vs. short polearms and probably better serves as an example of how pikes actually did require significant experience and training. The Scots had only recently adopted the pike, and while they had hired some foreign advisors the bulk of their army was made of common levies who had little experience and could only be fielded for a few weeks at a time. Similarly their officers had little experience in using pikes most effectively. In many ways the quality of the English infantry wasn't much better, but once both lines fell apart after contact, the short English billhook was more convenient in the confusion and they were more familiar in its use.\n\nBy contrast, at the battle of Seminara in 1495 the bulk of the spanish infantry was composed of flexible *rodeleros* which had proven very effective in skirmishes and sieges against the Moors in Spain. But despite defending across a river, the advancing Swiss mercenaries easily swept them aside. The defeat would convince the Spanish to reorganize their army so that it included larger proportions of pikemen and arquebusiers.\n\nShort weapons were still considered to have some uses, which I'll get to shortly, but by and large despite Flodden pikes came to be considered the superior polearm, even among the English.\n\n&gt;&gt;*Thomas Diggs (1579):* But wheras it hath bene among our men of warre a custom to have the bodie of our battails, halberdes, billes, battleaxes, or such short weapons, and to impale them only with certaine ranckes of pikes [i.e. a large block of billmen surrounded by ranks of pikemen], I think that custome first grew for want of sufficient numbers of pikes to make a solide battaile: for whosoever shall behold in the field two battailes, the one all massie through-out of pikes and the other of short weapon, onely impalled with certaine rankes of pikes, shall finde even in the eye a marvellous difference, in such sort as a man would farre sooner choose to charge, and hope to break the battaile impaled, then that which is massie with pikes:\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;*Thomas Styward (1582):* He must appoint to his armed pikes his most valiant souldiers, who must bee gentlie vsed, shewing vnto them a chéerfull and good coun∣tenance, which to them is most acceptable.\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;. . .that any should be armed pikemen, as it is trulie said, they with the armed are the whole strength of the footmen,\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt; Pykes. THose bearing that warlike weapons espe∣cially the frontes which serue in the place of Gentlemen, must haue a faire Corslet, with all the péeces appertaining to ye same, that is the curats, the collers, the poldrens with the Uambraces: also the long taces &amp; the burganet, with Swoord and Dagger, their Pykes of the vsuall length (for the strength of the battaile doth consist in the same) bearing the pykes on their shoulders, setting their thombs vnder the same, whereby it is ruled. They must oftentimes practise to traile, push, warde, couch, crosse, &amp;c. as for the necessitie of the skirmish or battaile ap∣pertaineth.\n\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;*Roger Williams (1590):* [of the Spanish army] al their Gentlemen &amp; van∣tagers are armed [armored] men, the most carry the pike,\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt; THe Pike is the most honorable weapon that is car∣ried by footmen; the Pike is the strength of al bat∣tailes. \n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;*William Garrard (1591):* . . . for in this our age experiēce &amp; practise makes apparant that Archers amongest forr•…ine Nations be neuer vsed, and the Halberd but either amongst fewe or fewe in number.\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt; [regarding the fitness required for each weapon] to a tall man a Pike, to a meane stature a halberd, and to a litle nimble person a Peece.\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;*Robert Barret (1598):* True it is, that in time past our nation hath performed round slaughter. worke therewith: but the warres and weapons are now altered from them dayes, and we must accommodate our selues to the now vsed weapons, order, and time, to answere our enimies with the semblable, else happely shall we finde ourselues short of our reckening, with our all-too late repentance. But might I haue, in stead of these blacke Bills and Iacks, so many good armed Pikes, I meane good Corslelts furnisht, I would thinke my selfe farre better either to offend or defend.\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;The pike and corselet is of most e∣stimation with footmen, for being a weapon of most firmenesse in the field, wher∣with all squares of men are formed, as a most sure defence against the fury of horsemen. Of fierie manuall weapons, the musket is of most execution and force; next to them, the calliuers; those to enuiron the pikes, and to be deuided into ma∣ny small troupes and bands, do serue to best purpose.\n\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;Now for the Pike, which the Spaniards do tearme *Sen̄ora y Reyna de las armas,* the Queene and mistresse of weapons. \n\n---\n\nNow, regarding the usefulness of the weapons in different situations, quoting from the linked post:\n\n&gt;That's nonsense. Choking down on the shaft just results in a huge, unweildy wooden stick sticking out behind you. It's impossible to fight effectively when you have 10 feet of pike in front of you, and 10 feet of pike behind you.\n\nWith plenty of room, this isn't necessarily true. George Silver in his *Paradoxes of Defence* considered the pike a very effective weapon in one on one combat, perhaps more difficult to handle than an 8-9 foot half-pike but he thought it good enough to hold the advantage over the shorter halberd, black bill, or sword.\n\nItalian Fencing instructor Giacomo di Grassi similarly includes instructions for one on one fencing with the pike, writing: \"As among all other weapons, which are worn by the side, the single sword is the most honorable. . . So among the weapons of the Staff, the Pike is the most plain, most honorable, and most noble weapon of all the rest.\"\n\nIt is true however that pikes could become unwieldy in confined spaces or if the formation become disordered. As a result the short weapons could useful in situations where the pikeman would be forced to draw his sword:\n\n&gt;&gt;*Robert Barret:* For I know them [short weapons] necessarie for many peeces of seruice; as to performe executiō if the enemie break, or flie; to mingle with shot to back them if neede be; to passe with Conuoyes, &amp; to stand by your Artillerie; to creepe along trenches, and enter into mynes, where the Pike would be ouerlong; but best for the myne or breach is the Target of prooffe, short sword, and Pistoll: but for the plaine field, neither blacke bill, Hal∣bard, nor Partizan comparable to the Pike.\n\nWithout getting into a debate about sword&amp;target vs halberd. The short weapons could be mixed in with gunmen to help protect them while skirmishing or assaulting a trench, they could be carried by officers on the periphery of the formation for self defense, and they could be stationed around the ensigns in the center of a pike square to help guard them in the formation fell apart.\n\nDespite this the use of halberds continued to decline until they were relegated to a largely ceremonial role. According to Barret, this was because if a push of pike did close into \"pell-mell\" there often wasn't enough room to swing a halberd either, or even a short sword, and once the enemy got near the center of the pike square it was lost anyways. Alternatively it might have to do with the improving effectiveness of muskets, which was making it less common for infantry to get close or engage in a lengthy melee before one side broke, and meant that skirmishers on rough terrain could more effectively defend themselves with largely their shot alone. In either case musketeers seem to have been rarely brave enough to hold their ground against a charging pike square on open ground without a pike square of their own to back them up, so pikemen would continue to serve as \"the strength of the battle\" for quite some time.\n\nTo conclude, pikes weren't just crummy zerg rush weapons, and despite looking cool halberds weren't some sort of wonder-waffle that was the best at everything.\n\nTo finish with one last point:\n\n&gt;Maurice of Nassau realized that he didn't actually need to waste manpower on a bunch of people standing around holding sticks, when he could give everybody a gun instead and it would have the same effect.\n\nNo he didn't.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\n\"An Arithmeticall Warlike Treatise\" Diggs\n\n\"1582.

        "text": "[This reddit thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4qceic/reddit_whats_your_most_interesting_nsfw_fact/) is an absolute gift for bad history.  [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4qceic/reddit_whats_your_most_interesting_nsfw_fact/d4rxnjq) is just one example.\n\n&gt;&gt; Edward II had such a disastrous reign as King of England nearly 700 years ago that his enemies couldn't afford to keep him alive any longer, so they forced him to abdicate, imprisoned him and then had him assassinated by shoving a red hot poker up his arse.\n\n&gt;&gt; He was then ironically nicknamed Edward Ironside.\n\n&gt; You forgot the best part. The people overthrowing him were a coalition of armies from France headed by his own jilted wife (it was well attested that Edward II was gay, hence the anal ironing), Isabella of France and her lover, Roger Mortimer. She became known as She-Wolf of France. Mortimer and Isabella would put Edward II's favorite (and probable lover) Hugh Despenser the Younger on trial and watched him get castrated, hanged, drawn and quartered. She and Roger ruled England as regents for four years until her son, Edward III, overthrew them in a coup.\n\nOh, where do we begin?\n\n* \"Had him assassinated\" is by no means uncontroversial.  Some suggest (e.g. Ian Mortimer in *The Greatest Traitor*) that his death was faked, others that he died of natural causes.  It is true that most historians believe that he was probably murdered, though.\n* \"by shoving a red hot poker up his arse\": this is almost certainly a later fabrication.  The earliest accounts of Edward's death have him dying of natural causes or being suffocated.  I don't think that any modern historians seriously believe the red-hot poker story.\n* \"was then ironically nicknamed Edward Ironside\": **Edmund** Ironside was the king of England in 1016, overthrown by Cnut. According to wikipedia, he was known as Ironside \"because of his valour\".\n* \"it was well attested that Edward II was gay\": \"gay\" is a problematic term for someone who lived half a millennium before the concept of being gay as we know it today began to develop.  It certainly wasn't \"well-attested that Edward II was gay\", because it wasn't a category that medieval chroniclers would have understood.  Edward II not only had a son by his wife, Isabella, but also an illegitimate son. (Though he may well *also* have had sexual relationships with men).\n* \"Edward II's favorite (and probable lover) Hugh Despenser the Younger\": Edward II's favourite who is usually considered a likely lover was Piers Gaveston. Isabella and Mortimer did both hate the Despensers, but in that they were joined by a significant proportion of England's nobility.  I don't know of any historians who have suggested that it was because Despenser and Edward were fucking.\n\nI leave other bad history in the thread as an exercise to the reader.",

        "text": "So here we have [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6kfqsw/brexit_1776/) on the front page, and [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6kfqsw/brexit_1776/djlqfgr/) high up. Of course the comment is quoting *Hamilton* (I mean I didn't know that, but someone else said it) but someone else took it literally and decided to ['explain'](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6kfqsw/brexit_1776/djlvz1c/) the American Revolution to us all. Now there are other comments there that aren't great or don't explain the whole picture, but this one is by far the worse. Let's get started\n\n&gt; Because that ragtag volunteer army was comprised of hardcore frontiersmen who basically invented modern guerilla warfare...sitting in trees with rifles (vs smoothbore muskets) picking off enemy officers dressed in red.\n\nOkay, starting off with a bang here. First, the Continental Army was hardly comprised of these guys, I mean yeah there were definitely rifleman with Kentucky Longrifles led by people like [Daniel Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan) who *did* shoot officers in battles like Saratoga; but to say this is why the Americans won the war instead of just saying those tactics were useful in numerous battles is a huge over exaggeration. \n\n&gt; Not to mention they were dealing with a greatly emaciated British Empire who was hot off the heals of saving our asses in the 7 Years War. \n\nSaving our asses? It was a global war, and America was another front of it and for France and Britain to fight over their claims in the area. Could you really calling it 'saving our asses', I mean, I guess? Just a real twisting of words, but that's not as important as:\n\n&gt; We started that shit literally by ourselves and then started a world war, then complained once the Brits needed to find a way to pay for the war we started and demanded they back us up on.\n\nThis. We started the 7 years war? What? Nothing about Austria wanting to take back [Silesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession) or the [Diplomatic Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_Revolution)? The American and French skirmishes in the New World was just a small part for the clash of empires that was the 7 Years War, to say we 'started' it and then demanded the British help us is completely ludicrous.\n\n&gt; Prior to the war, the status quo for British governance of the colonies was known as \"salutary neglect,\" meaning the British government was extremely lenient in enforcing Parliamentary law.\n\nOkay, can't dispute that, the British never bothered enforcing most of their trade laws and such.\n\n&gt; Once the 7 Years War was over, they actually REDUCED taxes but started actually enforcing them because they just got done with a huge, expensive war\n\nHe's kind of right here, yes, some of the taxes were [reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Act) but [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765) were [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts). Anyhow, the main issue wasn't that taxes were being enforced, it was of course that they were being levied on the colonists without their consent. 'No Taxation without Representation', how could he gloss over that? You would think it's ingrained in every American's head. \n\n&gt; (which wasn't truly over anyways, I'm sure the British were more concerned with Napoleon than the American colonies).\n\nWew, what? Napoleon was 6 years old when the Declaration of Independence was signed, I don't think the British were interested in him just yet. \n\n&gt; But because the founding fathers were almost literally all Han Solos (they called them rum-runners back then, John Hancock was literally a fucking smuggler by trade)\n\nOkay, again, wew. Almost literally all? I mean yeah John Hancock has been described as a smuggler before but even that is questioned and the infamous case of the [Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock#Liberty_affair) resulted in the charges being dropped. It isn't looking so good for the other founding fathers too, unless I've been unware that these lawyers and wealthy planters were all actually smugglers this entire time. Now sure, I'm positive none of them followed the mercantilist trade laws like every other American but that doesn't make them smugglers.\n\n&gt; they really, really, really did not like the prospect of their smuggling operations finally being scrutinized, so they started a bullshit political movement and Brexited because of asshole big-business moves.\n\nWell okay, they weren't smugglers, except maybe John Hancock as we described earlier, so that couldn't be a reason they decided to revolt. One again, No Taxation without Representation, the founders were generally wealthy, yes, so perhaps you could say they were financially tied with getting rid of all of these taxes; but if that was the case, there wouldn't be a ton of reasons to continue after all of the taxes save the Tea Act were repealed. He also doesn't mentioned Quartering or the Intolerable Acts which really helps to make his narrative that the British were in the right the entire time and the colonists were only revolting because some rich guys didn't like losing money. \n\n&gt; I'm a red-blooded patriot and I own more guns than you'd care to know, but I'm also a history nerd and I honestly can not claim that the American Revolution was justified.\n\nIt's nice to know this 'red-blooded patriot' would have been a loyalist. \n\n",

        "text": "The pseudo historical myths surrounding the Late Roman philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria are a rich seam of bad history, but few of the many terrible articles I've seen on this subject manage to get as much wildly wrong as [\"The Ancient History of Sexism Begins with Hypatia’s Murder\"](https://worldhistory.us/ancient-history/ancient-egypt/the-ancient-history-of-sexism-begins-with-hypatias-murder.php#respond) found on [World History](https://worldhistory.us/).\n\n&gt;\"Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 355. \"\n\nNormally a simple statement of when someone was born would be unproblematic, but the date of Hypatia's birth is the subject of some debate.  This could be disregarded as a simple error or just glossing over a controversy (though why not add a \"we think\" or \"was perhaps\"?), but given that the author cites Maria Dzielska *Hypatia of Alexandria* (Harvard, 1995) as one of their sources and Dzielska goes into the issue in some detail, it's very strange that the article gives 355 as her birth date with no caveats.  This is the first of several indications that the author never actually read Dzielska's excellent book.  Indeed, virtually everything the author states is directly contradicted by Dzielska's conclusions.  It seems the reference to her book was added to pad out the \"sources\", which otherwise consist of a crappy movie and a book of fantasy from 1908.\n\n&gt;\"Her story is eloquently told in the 2009 film, Agora.\"\n\nWell, it may be \"eloquent\".  [\"Accurate\" is another issue entirely](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com.au/2010/05/hypatia-and-agora-redux.html) ... Much of the nonsense in this article comes from the author treating this historically garbled movie as a sober documentary. \n\n&gt;\"Hypatia invented the plane astrolabe, the graduated brass hydrometer, and the hydroscope.\"\n\nAstrolabes predate Hypatia by about 500 years.  A reference in a letter by Hypatia's student Synesius accompanying a gift of an astrolabe to Paeonius says \"[This astrolabe] is a work of my own devising, including all that she, my most revered teacher [i.e. Hypatia] helped to contribute, and it was executed by the best hand to be found in our country in the art of the silversmith.\"  Synesius is talking about the design of the particular instrument he's presenting, not saying Hypatia invented astrolabes.  On the contrary, in the same text he discusses the earlier development of astrolabes and attributes their invention to Hipparchus (see Synesius [\"On an Astrolabe\"](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/synesius/synesius-on-an-astrolabe/synesius-on-an-astrolabe-3/), 3.)\n\nAnother letter by Synesius, this time addressed to Hypatia herself, certainly does discuss a hydroscope and asks her to send him one.  But it also [goes to some lengths in describing what a hydroscope is and how it works](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/synesius/synesius-letter-015/), so it's fairly clear he is not writing to the instrument's inventor.  And a \"hydrometer\" is simply another name for a hydroscope.  \n\nSo Hypatia actually invented none of these instruments.\n\n&gt;\"It was not unusual then for women to teach science, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy.\"\n\nActually, it **was** unusual.  It was not unknown, and we have *a few* other examples of female philosophers, but it was definitely unusual.  This is one of several examples of the author projecting modern political ideals onto the story.\n\n&gt;\"She was the daughter of Theon, who taught mathematics at the Museum of Alexandria, the center of Greek intellectual and cultural life and home to the great library of Alexandria.\"\n\nShe was certainly the daughter of Theon but the claims about him and the Museum/*Mouseion* and the inevitable reference to the \"great library of Alexandria\" are highly dubious.  A very late source, the Byzantine *Suda*, refers to Theon as \"the man from the Mouseion\", but it is hard to tell exactly what this means.  It is most likely that the Mouseion of the Ptolemaic kings, and its famous library, was long gone by Theon's time, given that the Royal Quarter of Alexandria in which it had stood had been sacked and burned by Caracalla, Aurelian and Diocletian in succession.  It could be that some other successor \"Mouseion\" had been established and Theon studied there or it could be that \"the man from the Mouseion\" is stylised honorific or even a personal nickname - meaning \"a scholar like one from the old days\".  That the Mouseion and its library still existed in Theon and Hypatia's time is pretty much fantasy.\n\n&gt;Theon, a dogmatic liberal, set out to make his daughter the perfect human being.\n\nThe description of Theon as \"a dogmatic liberal\" is a ludicrous anachronism.  What little we know about him would make it impossible to guess at his political orientation in any way and trying to impose modern political labels on people in the fifth century is ridiculous anyway.\n\n&gt;\"Only 100 years before Hypatia’s birth, the ruler of the Roman Empire, Constantine, embraced Christianity and from that moment everyone in the empire became a Christian by his edict.\"\n\nThis is total nonsense.  Constantine actually tried to avoid imposing his new religion on anyone, especially early in his reign.  Christianity did not become the state religion until decades later, under Theodosius, and even then it was only state-sponsored and public pagan worship that was proscribed and this was erratically enforced at best.\n\n&gt;But they remained Pagans by character, despite his order that made every Pagan temple a Christian church and every Pagan priest a Christian preacher.\n\nConstantine made no such \"order\" and no emperor did later.  Some temples were seized by the state and some of those were converted into churches, but the idea that all temples instantly became churches is total nonsense.  Ditto for the idea that all pagan priests suddenly becoming Christians, which is as impractical as it is ridiculous.  And wrong.\n\n&gt;\"She was 5’9” tall and weighed 135 pounds when she was 20 and easily walked 10 miles without fatigue, rowed, drove her own chariot, rode bareback, and climbed mountains. She was said to have had “a body of rarest grace.” Rachel Weisz, who plays her in the film, apparently bears a close resemblance.\"\n\nAll total fantasy. We are told she was beautiful as a young woman and that she had \"self-possession and [an] ease of manner\" (Socrates Scholasticus), but we have no idea what (let alone who) she looked like and the precise height and weight and other details here are complete fiction.\n\n&gt;\"As director of the Library’s Neo-Platonist school of philosophy ...\"\n\nSee above - \"the Library\" had ceased to exist about a century before she was born.  The daughter library in the Serapeum is also most likely to have ceased to exist by her time as well. And no source mentions her in relation to any \"library\" anyway.  The author's source here seems to be the movie *Agora*, which creatively entangles the myths about Hypatia with the myths about the \"Great Library\".\n\n&gt;\"She appears to have been the first to realize, long before Kepler, that the sun is the focus, not the center, of the universe, and that planets therefore orbit the sun in ellipses, not circles.\"\n\nMore movie fantasy.  Again, this is straight from Amenábar's film *Agora*, which invented this whole idea.  There is no evidence that Hypatia, who was the daughter of a learned commentator on Ptolemy, somehow rejected the Ptolemaic model and any speculation she did so is fanciful in the extreme.\n\n&gt;\"When she was just a girl, Theon taught Hypathia that to know but one religion is to know just one superstition whereas to know one philosophy is to know no absolute truth. Religions are accepted passively in faith, but science demands constant doubt to motivate the investigation necessary to discover new knowledge.\"\n\nMore fantasy.  We have no idea exactly what Theon taught his daughter, but the idea that it involved modern ideas about the rejection of \"religions\" in favour of \"science\" is nonsense.\n\n&gt;\"Neo-Platonism is a progressive philosophy, and does not expect to state final conditions to men whose minds are finite. Life is an enfoldment, and the further we travel the more truth we can comprehend. To understand the things that are at our door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie beyond&gt;\"\n\nGiven that no writings of Hypatia's survive, this is obviously not something that Hypatia wrote.  This supposed quote also contains terms and phrases that are anachronistic (\" a progressive philosophy\") or just plain weird (\"life is an enfoldment\").  A quick Google on this \"quote\" also reveals that it can be found in just one place online - this \"World History\" article.  It seems the author was having so much fun making up history that they also decided to make up this quote.  Keep your eyes peeled, /r/badhistorians, because we may see this \"quote\" popping up elsewhere in the future, knowing how crap like this tends to propogate.\n(Edit: It seems this \"quote\" is actually one invented by Elbert Hubbard - see below)\n\n&gt;\"As Elbert Hubbart wrote about Hypatia in his 1908 book, Great Teachers ...\"\n\nEr yup.  [Elbert Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_Hubbard) (1856-1915) was a soap-salesman, huckster and general eccentric who turned his hand to writing and never let a complete lack of sources get in the way of a good story.  So when he made Hypatia a focus in his 1909 book of instruction *Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great Teachers* he didn't let the total lack of any surviving teachings by Hypatia slow him down.  He simply made up \"quotes\" from her, many of which continue to circulate to this day, still misattributed to her.  \n\n&gt;\"Alexandria was ruled by a Roman Prefect, or Governor, named Orestes, a Pagan like Hypatia. \"\n\nAll the sources agree that Orestes was actually a Christian.\n\n&gt;\" Rome exercised great religious tolerance.\"\n\nExcept when Rome didn't, such as in the annihilation of the Bacchae, the extinction of the Druids and the periodic persecution of Christians and Manicheans.\n\n&gt;\"As a Pagan, Orestes was an adversary of the new Christian bishop, Cyril, and he vigorously objected to Cyril’s expulsion of the Jews from the city. For this opposition, he was murdered by Christian monks.\"\n\nAs noted above, he was not a pagan and his opposition to Cyril was a purely political struggle for hierarchical supremacy in the city and had nothing much to do with religion.  And he was not murdered by anyone, though he did get a stone to the head in a demonstration which in turn sparked the tit-for-tat factional killing that ended with the political assassination of Hypatia.\n\n&gt;\"Cyril next began to plot against his other major Pagan opponent in Alexandria, Hypatia. As a woman who represented heretical teachings, including experimental science and pagan religion, she made an easy target.\"\n\nMore fantasy.  We have no evidence she did any \"experimental science\" and there is no reliable evidence that her learning, any \"heretical teachings\", her paganism or even her gender were factors at all.  She seems to have been targeted simply because she was a political ally of Orestes in a factional squabble.\n\n&gt;\"He preached that Christ had no female apostles, or teachers. Therefore, female teachers had no place in Christianity. This sermon incited a mob led by fanatical Christian monks to attack Hypatia as she drove her chariot through Alexandria. \"\n\nAgain, this is straight from the 2009 movie.  There is no such preaching even hinted at in the sources.\n\n&gt;\"The Dark Ages Begin\"\n\nAnything that we could call \"the dark ages\" began somewhat later and in far off western Europe, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  Hypatia lived in the Eastern Empire, which lasted for another 1000 years\n\n&gt;\"Hypatia’s students fled to Athens.\"\n\nThere is no evidence of them fleeing anywhere.\n\n&gt;\"The Neo-Platonism school she headed continued in Alexandria until the Arabs invaded in 642.\" \n\nSo much for her death bringing on a dark age then.\n\n&gt;\"When they burned the library of Alexandria, using it as fuel for their baths, the works of Hypatia were destroyed.\"\n\nThe legend of the Caliph Omar burning any library in Alexandria is dated to centuries after his time and is almost certainly nonsense.  And the actual Library had ceased to exist before Hypatia was even born anyway, as explained above.\n\n&gt;\"Her writings are only known today through the works of others who quoted her \"\n\nNo they aren't and no they didn't.\n\n&gt;\"Cyril, the fanatic Christian who incited her destruction, was made a saint.\"\n\nAt least they managed to get one thing right.  These articles about Hypatia are usually riddled with nonsense, but I count at least 26 errors of fact or outright fantasies and inventions in this one.  I think this must be some kind of record.\n\nSources:\nMaria Dzielska, [Hypatia of Alexandria](https://www.amazon.com/Hypatia-Alexandria-Revealing-Antiquity-Dzielska/dp/0674437764) (harvard, 1995)\nEdward J.

Societies die in a sea of orgies, perhaps the kids in the latter days weren't quite up to scratch when compared to their forefathers, or everyone just went for cake and massages instead of managing the Empire. Whatever the logic behind such statements, they're rarely true, so here is your chance to set the record straight and explain why the so-called decadent empire of choice really collapsed. Or maybe you know of one where this was actually the cause of the end. And finally you can also use the post to explore the origins of this theory.

        "text": "So, folks, we all know the Bay transformers movies are bad, right? I went to see TLK with the girlfriend the other day to enjoy a shit-fest and was frankly *appalled* by it's use of history. I think it's fair to say we don't expect anything... Accurate in these movies, but The Last Knight in particular has such a specific focus on historical events and persons, and then proceeds to disrespect these characters, make a mockery of beloved mythologies, and blatantly contradict itself repeatedly.\n\nThe most egregious example of bad history is the usage, portrayal, and downright satirization of one of the most famous historical figures. A person of great importance to the mythology,  who has been famously portrayed by one of the greatest actors to have ever lived, who's motives are rarely understood and mythological backstory known to the common person, but say his name to anyone in the 21st Century English Speaking world and you will almost certainly get a reply of familiarity.\n\n~~Merlin~~\n\nSorry, I mean **Unicron**.\n\nYes, my friends, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.  Let us punish the guilty. Let us reward the innocent. My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about the fact that Unicron is **the Earth**. \n\nNow, I'm not sure how familiar most of you are with the intricacies of the various [Universal Streams](http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Universal_stream) in this multiverse, but the basics of the historical fact best seen in the biographical profile in Transformers Club 10 (Savage, 2006), but there exist two \"avatars\" in the multiverse, one of Destruction and Chaos (Unicron) and one of Order and Creation (Primus, aka Cybertron). Whereas entities like you, or me, or Optimus Prime and Megatron can have different instances in many streams (or, to put it in lay terms, may have existed in many different universes), these are more akin to \"similar characters\" who happen to look the same, as if some television show rebooted itself continually but wanted to keep some brand appeal. However, Unicron and Primus are unique in that they are omni-dimensional, existant in all dimensions. Now, Primus is a sort of universal constant, or flashpoint, similar to, say, the Dark Tower where he exists at all times in all universes (though you can't use him to travel between universes, and his complete destruction in one means his destruction in all); however Unicron exists more as a temporal anomaly, his consciousness shifting between different \"instances\" of himself (best seen in the docu-drama trilogy, The Unicron Trilogy, 2002-2006). Essentially, that means that Unicron is the interuniversal IRA, he only has to be lucky once, but Primus needs to be lucky all the time. \n\nNow, sorry for that indepth explaination but I felt it nessecary to provide context for this 'reveal', and show the absurdity of their claims. Unicron being Earth is not an unknown plot element (Prime, 2011), however in Bay's flawed interpretation, we see Cybertron in close proximity to Earth not once, but *twice* (and in this film literally TOUCHING Earth). Yet the only response by Unicron is a slight growth of horns around the world, admittedly cleverly they form a ring when the continents shift back to their Pangaea state, implying Unicron somehow became dormant 175 million years ago. Nevermind the [documented feeding patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lo7JPLJUUU) of Unicron indicate a need for sustenance, unlike that of the Primus varity.\n\nNow, historically, Unicron has been known to stay dormant, even near Cybertron (Armada, 2002); yet there is always some.. Plan being concocted. Forgive the brevity, but given Unicron exists as a mere namedrop and hook for the inevitable sequel, it truly feels like the Studio forced the Unicron elements without caring about the historical implications of such a being; as if, for example, in the Wonder Woman movie (which I haven't seen myself) after defeating the random big-bad and ending The War, we see a man twirling his handlebar moustache in dastardly contemplation while angrily sighing to himself [\"Jewwwwwsss....\"](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1b/a8/74/1ba87422148ad18c8ad293b9d84ae993.jpg) (citation unavailable). \n\nI won't even get into the idea of the Cybertronians \"creator\" (a bad distillation of the Quintesson theory, and a corruption of traditional Primus belief systems from the Iaconian region), or the fact that Unicron is named \"Cybertron's\" ancient enemy and not Primus' (gotta save that reveal for the historically illiterate, and on an unrelated note I'm reading this book called \"the Bible\" and the main character is so nice I hope nothing happens to him). What we are seeing is a total disregard of the historical streams that came before this movie, and a distillation of accept mythological canon.To remove figures such as Primus, and add in this \"Quintessa\" (that name... Seriously...) is to utterly change the development of the growing Cybertronian culture. I would comment about how this could possibly affect the historical myth of the Thirteen, but I'm not actually well versed in that subject myself, so if anyone else knows I'd be grateful for an explaination.\n\nOh yeah, and there's something about the Knights of the Round Table, and Merlin, and his staff, but that wasn't too bad.\n\nIMO this is a spit in the face of the victims of this menacing, yet important, historical figure. We've seen the effect of [survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdLPMOLOPx4) of Unicron's actions, and yet to shamelessly portray him in such a manner is... Despicable.\n\n(Also, sorry, meant to do this with anything goes saturday but was sick yesterday).",

        "text": "I have just purchased a book called *The Great Armies of Antiquity* by Richard A Gabriel, who is a professor at the Department of History and War Studies at the Royal Military College of Canada and in the Department of Defence Studies at the Canadian Forces College in Toronto. He is also a former US Army officer. This makes the mistakes he has made in this title even more alarming.\n\nSo upon opening this text I went straight to Chapter 9: Persia and the Art of the Logistics. Then, after regaining consciousness, I decided the errors present must be addressed. First of all, Gabriel states that Cyrus the Great \"introduced universal military training among the Persians\" (page 160). Herodotus makes no mention of Cyrus establishing this reform, and nor does Strabo or (as far as I can tell) Xenophon. Herodotus mentions that the Persians \"educate their children, beginning at five years old and going on till twenty, in three things only, in riding, in shooting, and in speaking the truth\". This up-bringing would most likely apply only to a certain section of society. The Zoroastrian holy Text, the Zend Avesta, divides early Iranian society into several classes, of which one was the warriors. If Achaemenid Persia retained this class structure (which is likely as Herodotus mentions the priests, or magi, as being a separate \"tribe\"), then there was no universal military training at all. Rather, the youth of the warrior class were subject only to the type of training common to an aristocratic martial culture, as opposed to the Persians being militirized as a whole. \n\nThe next mistake is when Gabriel writes that during \"the early wars against the Medes, the Persians had no cavalry units of their own and had to rely upon those provided by other troops\" (page 160). I must temporarily abandon my academic demeanor and say 'lol wut'.  This stems from a too-literal reading of the Cyropedia by Xenophon, which claimed that it was Cyrus who encouraged the Persians to fight as cavalry. Kaveh Farrokh, in *Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War*, writes that the Persians, as an Iranian people, where experts in mounted warfare on both chariots and horses (pages 20 and 24). This is further corroborated in the Zend Avesta, which associates the Iranian warrior class with chariots and also frequently references horse-riding. Thus the claim that the Persians had no cavalry is complete lunacy. \n\nFollowing on from this, Gabriel asserts that Persian heavy cavalry had shields (page 162) . This is again derived from taking Xenophon at his work without seeking verification from other sources. Achaemenid seals such as these:\n\nhttp://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/styles/greco-persian/warfare.htm\n\nhttps://pp.vk.me/c631417/v631417278/15cfb/TP3o_yG9wYA.jpg\n\nClearly show no shield being used by cavalry. Additionally, and ironically, Xenophon describes a group of Persian horsemen in the *Anabasis* as a \"bodyguard of cavalry about six hundred strong, all armed with corselets like Cyrus, and cuirasses and helmets; but not so Cyrus: he went into battle with head unhelmeted. So too all the horses with Cyrus wore forehead-pieces and breast-pieces, and the troopers carried short Hellenic swords\". There is no clear mention of shields, even though Xenophon made it a point of mentioning other troops which long wicker and wooden shields. Gabriel also goes on to mention on the same page that \"The javelin, properly named, was invented by the Persians\". Now, his reasoning seems to be the that the Persians invented the javelin as it is *popularly known*,  as distinct from a spear thrown at an enemy. This is definitely still a mistake as evidence of Bronze-Age javelins (if we define them as being smaller than spears and intended to be thrown) has been found in both Syria and Egypt.\n\nLast of all, Gabriel states that, when a Persian army was about to fight a pitched battle, \"men in the front rank would often carry a tall wicker shield and a single spear while those in the ranks behind them carried no two spears and no shields\" (page 163). Whilst he is correct about the absence of shields, the idea that the other soldiers only carried spears is contradicted by both written and artistic sources. Herodotus made it very clear that Persians also had daggers and bows: \n\n\"Now those who served were as follows:—The Persians with this equipment:—about their heads they had soft felt caps called tiaras, and about their body tunics of various colours with sleeves, presenting the appearance of iron scales like those of a fish, and about the legs trousers; and instead of the ordinary shields they had shields of wicker-work, under which hung quivers; and they had short spears and large bows and arrows of reed, and moreover daggers hanging by the right thigh from the girdle: \"\n\nGreek vases also show the Persians using swords in addition to acting as archers:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a8/a4/94/a8a49472f909534d0c45e413d8858763.jpg\n\nhttp://www.timetrips.co.uk/mara-vase-persians-killed2.jpg\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b1/20/b1/b120b131f8368137ec66fe6072c0fba6.jpg\n\nThere are plenty of other misconceptions about the Persian army in that chapter, but those were the ones I felt to be most egregious.\n\nSources\n\nThe Anabsis, by Xenophon: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1170/1170-h/1170-h.htm\n\nThe Cyropedia, by Xenophon: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2085/2085-h/2085-h.htm\n\nGeographica, by Strabo: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/42968\n\nThe Great Armies of Antiquity, by Richard A Gabriel\n\nThe Histories, by Herodotus: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/828\n\nShadows in the Desert: Ancient Persian at War, by Kaveh Farrokh\n\nThe Zend Avesta: http://www.avesta.org/\n ",

You can prove this very simply by pointing out a few of the non-white people that were not enslaved: for example  Captain John Perkins a non-white, and non-enslaved, Royal Navy officer who gained his first command in [1778](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perkins_\\(Royal_Navy_officer\\)).\n\nBut perhaps attitudes changed after 1778? Presumably not in [1807](http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/slavetrade/overview/parliament-abolishes-the-slave-trade/) with the abolition of the slave trade, nor in [1824](http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_17.htm) when Britain defined participation in the slave trade as piracy and punishable by death, nor in 1833 with the abolition of slavery throughout the empire. \n\nOr perhaps this powerful \"white\" empire was still not powerful enough to enslave everyone that wasn't white up to the 1830s. If this is the case then surely it must have happened as the largest ever \"white\" empire reached its maximum power and was expanding through non-\"white\" Africa. There must surely have been a huge expansion of slavery as they enslaved everyone that wasn't white. Except it did not happen, because by this time they had both banned slavery and were actively trying to suppress it within its territory and through treaties.",

        "text": "[Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6iqhlw/mcdonalds_hits_alltime_high_as_wall_street_cheers/dj8mjic)\n\n&gt; Early socialism thrived during a period of increasing income inequality and the dominance of machines. It makes sense for similar thinking to come about in today's economic and technological climate.\n\n&gt; A lot of our negative view of socialism comes from the communism that grew out of the ashes of WW1 when Germany unleashed Lenin on Russia as a sort of weaponized memetic typhoid Mary. Hopefully modern post-capitalism will have a more realistic, less vitriolic approach.\n\nThere are some arguments I could make when 'early socialism' was around, but I'm going to assume the best in the user and figure they meant 'early Marxist socialism'. And similarly, that they are aware that the revolutions that started the process of turning Russia into the USSR started during WWI, and that there was just some awkward wording.\n\nSince there were multiple conflicts that resulted in the transition from \"Russia\" to \"USSR\" that happened in the period between 1905 and 1922, with the main events being during 1917, if I need to talk about multiples at the same time, I am refer to them broadly as \"the Soviet Revolutions\", otherwise I will try to specify which revolution I am referring to.\n\nWhat I want to focus on was the remark about Germany unleashing Lenin like a \"weaponized memetic typhoid Mary\", and I'm going to address this on the following grounds: 1) Germany's inability to control Lenin; 2) The a-historic nature of the idea; 3) the (likely) inevitability of the Soviet Revolutions; 4) The deeply stupid idea of using communism as a weapon\n\n**Problem One: Germany didn't control Lenin**\n\nIn general, I have no idea how people think Germany could have controlled Lenin. First of all, Lenin was in Austria-Hungry at the start of WWI, then moved to Switzerland where (as far as my brief read through on wikipedia tells me) he lived throughout the war before returning to Russia. How in the hell was Germany in a position to dictate Lenin's return to Russia? \n\nIt is true that Lenin (and co) returned to Russia via Germany after negotiating passage on the grounds of \"we're going to fuck some shit up\", but this was *Lenin's idea*, not the Germans. The Germans also didn't expect Bolshevism was going to gain any ground, their hope was the Russians would have to split off a group of soldiers to fight a small gang of revolutionaries (see point 4 for more).\n\n**Problem Two: Ignores valuable context**\n\nLenin returned to Russia after the February 1917 Revolution (ie, the kick off the end of Russia) was already resolved. It wasn't his idea, he didn't start it, he didn't lead it, he was basically uninvolved with it. Using a person as a political weapon in a conflict that is already over is a weird proposition. \n\nYes, Lenin was instrumental in the July Days in 1917 and the October 1917 Revolution, but *the Germans didn't know that was going to happen*. \n\n**Problem Three: The Revolution was probably inevitable**\n\nI suspect that saying \"the Revolution *was* inevitable\" would get me in trouble, so I'll just say \"probably inevitable\". \n\nBy 1917 there had been rising conflict in Russia for two decades, starting with 176 strikes from 1895 to 1905, culminating in a massive strike on 22 January 1905 where soldiers fired on the strikers resulting in 95 deaths, which led the 1905 Revolution that lasted almost 2 and a half years and included the Battleship Potemkin Uprising when imperial sailors (upset about, among other things, poor food) rose against the government and joined the revolutionaries. In June 1907 there was a coup, 1911 the PM was assassinated.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914 the majority of Russians supported the war, partly expecting major gains. But that didn't happen, and Russia lost a lot of territory early on. There was a large amount of conflict between civilian industrial leaders and military leaders regarding industrial output. In 1914 there is a lot of shortages of (among other things) food. In 1915 is the Great Retreat where Russia makes those mentioned territory loses. 1915 also sees more strikes where the strikers get shot. 1916 sees massive food shortages, which resulted in mass starvation and significant economic weakness, and the war begins seeing mass desertion partly as a result of low supplies and poor command. In 1916 the legislature (which was formed in response to the 1905 Revolution) is effectively dissolved, there's a month of strikes, a regiment of troops joins a group of strikers against the police, and in December 1916 the Tsar is told that his army probably not help him if there is a full blown revolution.\n\nKeep in mind, most of that happened while Lenin was not in Russia. \n\nBy the time of Lenin's return to Russia in early 1917, a violent far left revolution was probably inevitable. Nothing Lenin did likely changed that. At the absolute most, you could say that Lenin shaped the initial face of the USSR, but not the USSR becoming a thing. There was a number of other major Communist thinkers in Russia at the time who could have taken Lenin's place including that one dude from Georgia named \"Stalin\", or that other Russian \"Trotsky\". Not sure if anyone here has heard of them. \n\n**Problem Four: Germany would have to be deeply stupid**\n\nDid you know that Karl Marx thought that Communism would start in the industrial countries, not the largely agrarian and still industrializing ones like Russia? More specifically, he thought Communism would start in France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. There was no organized intentional effort on the part of the German government to push Communists into Russia with the intent of starting a Communist revolution, because that could have very easily ended with Communism spreading to Germany. \n\nStarting a fucking revolution on your borders that could easily spread to your country and fuck you up personally seems like only the plan of a deeply stupid person. The Germans figured Russia would have to fight itself or maybe the government would collapse, but an actual effective revolution was seen as out of the question.\n\n----\n\nAlso, memetic? Good word usage, but no. The groundwork was laid for a far left revolution before Lenin returned to Russia. \n\nI won't argue about Communism being comparable to Typhoid Mary, except to say that it's maybe unfair to Mary Mallon",

In [this video](https://youtu.be/a3w9pmvpyDM) at around 52 seconds in they say that the Dieppe raid \"left almost 4000 Canadian men dead on the beaches\" in the dieppe raid 907 Canadians died, 586 were wounded, and 1,946 were captured,  this gives us a total Canadian casualty count of 3,439, which doesn't even round to 4000.\n\nBut maybe they were talking about total allied ground casualties and decided to ignore the British and American casualties, well even then they are incorrect. Ground casualties for all the allied forces numbered 3717 (3,439 Canadians, 275 British, and 3 American army rangers). \n\nThe only way you get more then 4000 casualties is if you include naval casualties which numbered 550 dead and wounded, along with 33 landing craft and 1 destroyer sunk. However the navy in question was the Royal Navy, which means these casualties were British, not Canadian. I couldn't find the exact numbers of deaths for this however.\n\nHowever they said dead on the beaches, which would mean those specifically killed on the ground. As I already said, Canada lost 907 men at Dieppe. The total number of British casualties was 275, I don't know if that's a rough estimate or an actual casualty count, but I'll go with the latter. If we use the Canadian troops as an example of death rates in casualties we get a death rate of about 26%, which gives us a total of 71.5 deaths, I'll just round up and say that 72 British deaths occurred in Dieppe. American casualties numbered only 3. If you add all this up you get a total death total of ground forces in Dieppe of 982, meaning extra credits quadrupled the death count.\n\nI made this post only because I know people take this stuff at face value and now think that there were about 4000 deaths at Dieppe not almost 4000 casualties. The truth of Dieppe is that most of the allied casualties were prisoners. \n\nSources : [Basic fact checking on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_Raid?wprov=sfsi1) and Dieppe: Canada's Darkest Day of World War II for the American casualty count",

        "text": "Ah yes, \"Katy-patra\", no doubt one of Katy Perry's most iconic guises no matter how many superbowl sharks steal her spotlight. You may be thinking \"Hey /u/cleopatra_philopater, it is bad enough you rant about makeup in movies, have you gotten so low as to now be criticising sneakers and hydraulic chariots in a music video?'\n\nOf course not, I am only going to criticise the not obviously anachronistic aspects of the video like a normal person would.\n\nFirst off \"Katy-Patra\" makes no sense from a linguistic perspective because the name itself *has* a meaning, which can be alternatively rendered as \"Of glorious/illustrious father(s)\", \"Glory of her father\" or something to that effect. So even if we ignore that taking an English nickname and splicing it into a Greek name is weird, unlike some names that mean nothing and can be altered with little consequence, she is literally one who comes from \"Katy-ous Fathers\" or if we go with my second option she is the \"Katy of her fathers\" which is true in a literal sense at least.\n\n00:03 The caption reads \"Memphis, Egypt A Crazy Long Time Ago\" but we can see the Pyramids of Giza right on shore. Also I have to question just *how* long is a crazy long time. On the one hand the decision to base Perry's character off of Cleopatra would naturally place it in the Hellenistic period but on the other hand the choice of Memphis and the overall costume design is much more consistent with the New Kingdom with the exception of the obvious overuse of pink. On the other hand Patra says \"Make me your Aphrodite\" further implying a Ptolemaic association, and this fits with the type of serpentine image of a coiled, muscular snake that is often associated with Serapis and Hermanubis but does not fit so well with the heavily anthropomorphic gods we see later.\n\n00:07 We see numerous animal-headed attendants but animal head masks were exclusive to priestly functions. The blue-painted guards are also strange because blue pigment was expensive and even if she felt like shelling out for it, full body paint was not used by Egyptian guards so they ought not look like Blue Man Group.\n\n00:10 Katy Patra is wearing a white and blue wig but white hair was not a beauty standard in ancient Egypt and wigs were generally black.\n\n01:04 Katy Perry's tattoos are visible in several shots but ancient Egyptian tattoos were colourful henna temporary or permanent markings that were altered by adding mineral, natural or synthetic pigments, unlike Perry's which are clearly black ink tattoos.\n\n01:26 Although Thoth, Horus, and Anubis are obvious inclusions, the leonine and feline deities are stranger. Given Katy Patra's obvious association with goddesses like Isis, Hathor and Wadjet, as well as the Eye of Horus we see on her face in one outfit it would make sense if Sekhmet and Bast made an appearance but these statues are of muscular male deities. Egyptian statuary was also usually painted in bright, symbolic colours but were not bare as they are now.\n\n01:50 Sugar cane and corn (including corn syrup) to create the candy and twinkies was not available in ancient Egypt as is the case for the peppers that are implied by the overly spicy cheetos.\n\n02:15 Katy Patra does not instantly ice this fool for daring to wear a Pharaonic crown. Usurpation is serious but here is this nobody wearing the double crown, *and* the red/white colour dichotomy has been swapped to blue/gold. Wtf\n\n03:24 Katy Patra goes to the trouble of donning Isis' vulture crown and wings (kind of) but decides to trade out the sheath dress for golden midriff-bare armour and skirt combo. The yellow wig also does not help as Isis' black hair symbolised fertility.\n\n03:38 This is the second appearance of a miniature dog with the first one having frightened her cat attendants but neither of the dog varieties shown were known in the Ancient Near East or North Africa.\n\n03:40 Finally the setting is clearly in the middle of the Egyptian desert with nothing around, no cities, villages, plots of cultivated land or even adjoining buildings to facilitate all the service that an obviously tyrannical and demanding lady like Katy Patra requires.\n\n",

        "text": "From an alt-right \"news\" website: \n\n&gt;If you have been paying attention to the news lately, left wing groups are taking down monuments to Confederate leaders like Robert E. Lee (a pro-constitution, anti-slavery, non-drinking, non-smoking, no-profanity pious Christian) faster than they are putting up new gender affiliations.\n\n&gt;Why? Because two years since the murder of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church (which the left still just cannot shut up about), there has been a powerful SJW-dominated domestic jihad on any public memorials to the Confederate States of America. All because the white male perpetrator was seen holding Confederate memorabilia in a few pre-rampage photographs, most notably the “Confederate Flag” (more on this later).\n\nLet's ignore the fatuous introduction for the time being; all it does is parrot the usual alt-right hysteria.\n\n&gt;“If The South Won, We Would Still Have Slavery”\n\n&gt; Brazil was the last western territory to abolish slavery in 1888, but virtue signaling leftists want to pretend we would “still have slavery” in 2017 if the Confederacy won.\n\nIgnoring the extreme-left nut jobs and their hysteria, does anyone in the academic world (hell, even the media world) actually believe this? This seems a straw men argument at best. \n\n&gt; In the mid 19th century, slavery was going the way of the Dodo around the world, due to both rapid technological advancements in industrial societies rendering the cost-to-benefit analysis impractical, as well as it simply being the current moral zeitgeist of the age.\n\nThat's childish and historically illiterate thinking at best. The \"current moral zeitgeist\" clearly didn't affect John Crittenden, who sought to amend the Constitution to maintain slavery in perpetuity. I don't like Wikipedia as a source, but this article is actually okay: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise\n\n&gt; “The Confederate Flag Represents Slavery And White Supremacy”\n\n&gt;The “Confederate flag” at it is popularly known today has absolutely no direct political affiliation whatsoever, unlike say…. the Nazi flag that modern day SJW’s are always trying to compare the flag with. It is a battle flag which was utilized primarily by Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, and upon careful observation it hardly “represents slavery” and certainly not “white supremacy”.\n\nYes, the Confederate Battle Flag, flown by an army that fought to defend the CSA, can't possibly represent slavery. Beyond that, it's not like this flag was a significant portion of both the second and third flags of the CSA. Additionally, the \"Confederate Battle Flag\" is better termed the Naval Jack, being used by the small CSA navy. \n\nSource: http://www.usflag.org/confederate.stars.and.bars.html\n\n&gt;95% of Confederate soldiers did not own slaves, and I’m sure that the maintenance of “white supremacy” over their non-existent slaves was the number one thing on their minds as a 6-figure sum of southern white men (compared to a negligible amount of black soldiers on both sides) met their maker as a result of kissing some hot lead from a battlefield musket.\n\n95% is a high estimate at best and pretty close to an apologetic number. From Joseph Glatthaar's *General Lee's Army*: \n\n&gt;Even more revealing was their attachment to slavery. Among the enlistees in 1861, slightly more than one in ten owned slaves personally. This compared favorably to the Confederacy as a whole, in which one in every twenty white persons owned slaves. Yet more than one in every four volunteers that first year lived with parents who were slaveholders. Combining those soldiers who owned slaves with those soldiers who lived with slaveholding family members, the proportion rose to 36 percent. That contrasted starkly with the 24.9 percent, or one in every four households, that owned slaves in the South, based on the 1860 census. Thus, volunteers in 1861 were 42 percent more likely to own slaves themselves or to live with family members who owned slaves than the general population. The attachment to slavery, though, was even more powerful. One in every ten volunteers in 1861 did not own slaves themselves but lived in households headed by non family members who did. This figure, combined with the 36 percent who owned or whose family members owned slaves, indicated that almost one of every two 1861 recruits lived with slaveholders. \n\n&gt;“The Confederates Were Traitors”\n\nYes, they were. \n\n&gt; All the evidence clearly points out the Confederacy was peacefully following principles laid out by the founding fathers, the declaration of independence, and the 12 amendments of the U.S. constitution which were in place as of 1861. “Patriots” the Confederates may or may not have been. But “traitors” definitely not.\n\nUh, let's ignore Texas v. White, which says a state cannot secede from the Union. I'm sure there's some way to twist it, since it's a post Civil War case. The article quotes Patrick Cleburne, who proposed to free slaves in order to deal with the manpower issues that the South began to deal with as early as late 1862/early 1863. Of course, Cleburne's proposal was attacked as an abolitionist conspiracy. \n\n&gt;“The Confederates Were Terrorists”\n\n&gt;As for the true definition of terrorism, Hartmann and the rest of the SJW’s have a lot of nerve to act like the Union army never raped, pillaged, or terrorized the southern people via the policies of number 16 (Abraham Lincoln) and his wild lap dogs like General Sherman.\n\nYes, Sherman \"made Georgia howl,\" that's not really a point of debate among professional historians. But please, let's ignore people like William Quantrill, who burned Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863, executing 164 civillians, some of whom were political and military opponents, but many of whom were random men (and in some cases, boys) who had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nI've excluded a significant portion of the article, as a lot of it is simply alt-right hysteria about \"SJWs\" and \"liberals.\" \n\n",

        "text": "[Source](https://newint.org/features/1991/09/05/simply/)\n\n&gt;Human history is the history of migration and the most sophisticated civilizations arose where human traffic was heaviest. The Ancient Near East, the Indian sub-continent, China, the Americas, Europe – all had constant influxes of migrants bringing new ideas and change. And in ancient Greece the Delphic priests regarded the right of unfettered movement as one of four freedoms distinguishing liberty from slavery. Because they did not feel responsible for newcomers, rulers often saw them as an asset rather than a liability. They would add to a region’s wealth, contribute to taxes and serve in local armies.\n\nR5: No, no, no. [Even many pro-open borders groups acknowledge that the lack of a passport and visa system reflected the limited capacity of the central government as much as it did inherent tolerance.](https://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-chinese-exclusion-act-implementation-1882-1910/) While Rome was generally among the more tolerant ancient civilizations, [Athens for instance jealously guarded citizenship](https://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2017/02/22/immigration-politics-and-public-finance-in-ancient-rome/) and Rome (even setting aside the slavery thing) had [requirements for obtaining the vote as well as, yup, walls.](https://qz.com/796407/brexit-and-free-movement-what-citizens-of-europe-really-have-is-a-second-class-status-dating-back-to-ancient-rome/). [Sparta was infamous in the ancient world for its deportations](https://eidolon.pub/barbarians-inside-the-gate-part-i-c175057b340f), to the point where there was a word for it - [xenelasia](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3556481?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) - in Spartan Greek. Even indigenous people were regularly deported - [the Jews, repeatedly, were evicted from the Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora) and [exile was an accepted criminal punishment in Athens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism) So no, the ancient world was not an open borders utopia...arbitrary and capricious deportation of people with no other homeland was accepted.\n\n&gt;People moved constantly all over the world – be they Vikings, Crusaders or Chinese emigrants. Large scale restrictions, however, were imposed with the introduction of serfdom in Europe under the Roman Empire during the third and fourth centuries AD. Initially, controls were lax but under the Roman Emperor Constantine (AD 309–37) serfs were forbidden to leave their work place and had to accept whatever conditions their lords imposed. The Romans even introduced the first ‘passport’ – a document requesting safe passage for the bearer. By mediaeval times a large part of Europe’s population was bound in place and traded like chattels. Movement was considered inimical to order and the possibility for human migration was restricted mainly to wars. \n\nR5: The sentence about serfdom was debunked in the first paragraph; restrictions on both migration and citizenship predated Constantine, and Vikings and Crusaders were in no way peaceful immigrants (both also occurred after Constantine \"shut the borders\" too). According to even a very brief Google search, [something resembling a passport is found even in the Old Testament of the Bible.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport#History) And lastly, that sentence at the end that implies migration decreased after Constantine is kind of iffy; [that period was in fact a heyday of migration within Europe, the Levant, and North Africa.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period)",

        "text": "Now, with an upcoming expansion adding Russians to Battlefield One's Multiplayer, Dice has [made the decision to add women.](https://www.google.com/amp/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2017-05-23-battlefield-1-announces-first-female-multiplayer-soldier) To quote him, \"Yes, she's a female from a brutal WW1 formation, the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death, represented by the Russian Scout class\"\n\nNow I know that this is a game and not a very accurate game at that. I realize that I may be being a bit of a pedant. But who cares, I am a pedant, and pedants gotta ped. Now! For the inaccuracies!\n\nThe Russian Battalions of Death were a real [thing.](http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/roles-of-women-in-world-war-1-the-russian-battalion-of-death/) Before them, there were a number of men's battalions of Death, and many women started petitioning to serve. The Duma saw a great propaganda opportunity in this. After three years of disasters and horrible losses, the army's morale was in the dumps. The idea was,\n\n\"Oh, these women can do it, why not you?\"\n\nThus, the Battalions were formed in 1917.\n\nPretty much all of them defended the Winter palace or other places during the revolution, but only one actually served in combat in the First World War.\n\nIn May 1917, Maria Bochareva, a peasant girl who had served in the Army, rising to the rank of NCO, was one of the first to petition for female units.\n\nLong story short, the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death was approved by Kerensky formed with her at the head. Through her tough training regimen, only 300 would serve in the battalion.\n\nDuring the Kerensky offensive, the battalion was deployed to fight against the Germans. They served in one battle. One. Remember that.\n\nWhile attached to the 525th Kiuruk-Darinski Regiment, they saw action near the town of Smorgon.\n\nThe Regiment was ordered to attack enemy lines, but most of the regiment (hint, it was the part with Y chromosomes.) was hesitant and complained about enemy machine guns and artillery support. The Women's battalion of Death However, decided that (mostly due to inexperience with trench assaults in my opinion) they would charge the Germans alone. Miraculously, they succeeded in taking the trench with few casualties. Sadly, relief never came, and they were forced to withdraw, the Germans retaking the trench later.\n\nThe Commander of the Regiment commended them for their efficiency and bravery.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it for the women's Battalions in regards to WWI. If you are interested, they also did quite a bit in the revolution. However, I am here to talk about WWI, not the Russian Revolution.\n\nNow that we have covered this, we get into why this is badhistory for the game.\n\n[According to this site,](http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWarmies1914.htm) the total number of mobilized soldiers was around twelve million. It's kind of hard to pinpoint the exact number of soldiers at one particular year, so I'll just use this figure. Please don't crucify me.\n\nAccording to my math, 300 is exactly 0.0025% of 12,000,000. Meaning that your odds of finding even *one* woman in the front lines would be 40,000/1. Basically, you'd sooner get bitten by a shark and struck by lighting in the same day. I kid, I kid.\n\nThis brings up another point that I mentioned earlier, they only actually fought in one major battle. This means that, unless you can only play as her once, it's... it's... HISTORICALLY INACCURATE REEEEEEE!!!! Sorry for that cringey joke. But seriously.\n\nOne final thing I haven't mentioned so far is the actual playable character. She is one woman in a unit of men. No. They would be in a *regiment* with men, but not the same squad, platoon, company, or what have you. They would serve with other women.\n\nReal quick, I'd like to take a quick look at the character herself. [Pictured here, ](https://m.imgur.com/9egeJch)she seems to carry the Winchester 1895 with bayonet fixed on her back, an... interesting choice. In her left hand she holds a pistol that I actually don't recognize. The closest thing I can imagine is the [Smith and Wesson Model 3.](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C53CKpjMR9E/V8PUmQkYQeI/AAAAAAAAaQY/1tSXufywIUQJfy24E3xkqA7lnBmYCAGnQCLcB/s640/CA865-Russian-6.jpg) But I'm not entirely sure. If any of you fine people recognize it, please tell me. Now for her uniform. [Here we see the actual battalion, ](http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/military/images/women_soldiers2x.jpg) off to the right we see two Kuban Cossacks. What they were wearing was what pretty much the entire army except for a few regiments wore. If you look closely, you can see this under her coat. As for the coat, soldiers would be issued a trench coat. They would usually wear it when it was especially cold. Overall, I don't have a problem with this... wait, what... OH GOD HER BOOTS!!!! They look like a bunch of leather layers stacked on top of each other! Cthulhu save me from this! At least they had her pants tucked into the boots, they did do that. One final thing, where is her cap? She would be issue d a cover, where is it? But yeah, overall this is fine.\n\nBasically, odds are, you wouldn't ever even find a woman in the Russian Army, and if you did, she would be surrounded by other women. Plus, you'd only see them in one battle.\n\nLong story short, it's a video game, no one cares about history, but I still made this post because I like talking about WWI, and it happened a hundred years ago, so I was thinking about it.\n\n",

        "text": "So as fellow enthusiasts of history and lurkers of Reddit, no doubt many already know the story of the Chinese pirate [Ching Shih](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_Shih), who commanded a fleet of hundreds of junks and tens of thousands of pirates, called the \"Red Flag Fleet\". Supposedly, she was undefeated and instead brought defeat to the Qing Imperial fleets, the British and the Portuguese, and has come to be considered the \"most successful pirate of all time\". The story is well known and actually reposted often. \n\nI don't know much of anything about such Qing and British affairs and, to be honest, I was kinda surprised to never have even heard of any engagement between the Portuguese and the huge fleet of a pirate-lady in China. The only battle against a \"huge Chinese pirate fleet\" that I know of is a pretty famous one in Macau, called the battle of the *Boca do Tigre*, which I'm willing to believe few have ever heard of, [infact it only has a Portuguese wiki page as of yet](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_da_Boca_do_Tigre).\n\n\"Boca do Tigre\" is the Portuguese version of the [Humen Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humen), which means \"Tiger Gate\" in Chinese. Now, the story is, that in the early 1800s, the important Pearl River Delta was afflicted by the immense fleet of a notourious Chinese pirate whom the Portuguese called ''Quan Apon Chay'' (among others) who clashed with Portuguese armed vessels on some instances some years before. The Senate of Macau (the governing body of the city) considered this threat to local Macanese shipping intolerable, and pressed the governor Lucas José de Alvarenga to take action against the pirates and disperse their fleet. The governor organized a flotilla of 3, then 6, heavily armed brigs and a frigate, under the command of artillery captain José Pinto Alcoforado de Azevedo e Sousa. To keep it short, since the battle lasted almost a year between February 1809 and January 1810, after a series of dauting engagements a great part of the pirate fleet was destroyed by cannon fire, the remainder cornered into an inlet, and Quan Apon Chay forced to accept a capitulation to the Portuguese and Chinese authorities. \n\nNow here's the fun part: Quan Apon Chay, despite cornered, still commanded a pretty imposing fleet. Why waste resources disposing it entirely, if the Qing would be still as incapable of preventing new pirate fleets from arising afterwards? That's what the Portuguese governor and the high judge of Macau thought and hence, arranged with the Chinese authorities in Guangzhou the rehabilitation of Quan Apon Chay and his powerful fleet into the Chinese Imperial navy service instead! The Chinese emperor agreed and an amnesty was offered to Quan Apon Chay, who immediately left piracy, became a Qing Imperial admiral and henceforth devoted his time suppressing piracy around Guangzhou. He would go on to make ceremonial visits to the Loyal Senate of Macau to meet with the Portuguese officials who had defeated him and was received in honourable fashion. In the end, everyone was happy and satisfied, which is a pretty touching story..\n\nPersonally, I only heard about the story of Ching Shih not too long ago and no doubt by now, many noticed some similarities. When I went to know more about this floating warlord of a pirate, I learned that \"[Quan Apon Chay](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zh%C4%81ng_B%C7%8Eoz%C7%8Ei)\" just happens to be the Portuguese transliteration of [Cheung Po Tsai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheung_Po_Tsai), Ching Shihs own lover and admiral of the same Red Flag Fleet! After the amnesty, Ching Shih went on to \"open a gambling house\" which is no wonder, her own second-in-command turned in her entire fleet!",

I decided to waste 3 days of my life analysing the first few articles and how they don't hold any correlation between the Nazi Holocaust and the 6 million that died during it, instead of reading up on more interesting topics (although analysing ethnicities and censuses was super fun). I got straight up exhausted after analysing the entire first row (including Sept 8th, 1935), so be my guest if you want to do the rest.\n\nShort introduction if you don't like post titles: Nazis try to make a link between the 6,000,000 and word \"Holocaust\" mentioned by various people prior to WW2. Now, let's begin, shall we?\n\n\n\n# 1. Holocaust was not solely used to describe the actions of the Nazis against the Jews\n\n*Article used: May 16th, 1903*\n\nFrom what I can understand, the ones who made this picture are trying to say that Jews used the term “Holocaust” since the Kishinef Massacre of 1903, which is supposed to show that the Jews were part of some conspiracy to demonize a nation (in this case Russia, and later on Germany I presume).  This is ignoring the fact that \"Holocaust\" doesn't inherently mean \"Nazi Holocaust”, nor is it a word that only Jewish people use.  The word “Holocaust” was in broad secular use before the Nazi killings by various Non-Judeo people to describe various events in history:\n\n* [The Young Turks and the Truth about the Holocaust at Adna (1913 -- massacre of Armenians in 1909.)](https://vahagnakanch.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/adana-massacres.pdf)\n\n* [The Holocaust and Other Poems (1914 -- \"Holocaust\" in this title refers to the San Francisco earthquake and fire.)](https://archive.org/details/holocaustotherpo00sonn)\n\n* [The Holocaust in Minnesota (1918 -- great forest fire.)](https://books.google.lt/books?id=N3QkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=%22Holocaust+in+Minnesota%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK_f29hrHUAhWFC5oKHfxPBsoQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Holocaust%20in%20Minnesota%22&amp;f=false)\n\n* [The Holocaust: Italy's Struggle with the Hapsburg](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028273757#page/n5/mode/2up)\n\n* [\"It is no longer believed that \"the wars of the Roses made a holocaust of the old families\"[...]\". (American Historical Review, January 1915, p. 397)](https://ia802701.us.archive.org/9/items/americanhistoricv20jame/americanhistoricv20jame.pdf) -\n **This can take a while to load, slow internet users beware**\n\n\n\nTo add to that, “The Palestine Post” in 1938 used the “Holocaust” to name various wars and events, such as World War 1 and the Haifa attack(And we all know World War 1 was about the Jews and their devilish deeds, right?):\n\n* [ \"After the Haifa holocaust ... \"  (Column 2; “A Mutilated Letter”)](http://www.jpress.nli.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI/sharedpages/SharedView.Page.aspx?sk=94E26792&amp;href=PLS/1938/07/17&amp;page=8)\n\n*   [\"[...] the holocaust of 1914-18 [...]\" (Paragraph 2; “A Chance To Back Out”)](http://www.jpress.nli.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI/sharedpages/SharedView.Page.aspx?sk=38AB0AD3&amp;href=PLS/1938/09/11&amp;page=8)\n\nFinally, the term “Holocaust” can be traced all the way back to 1662 in Samuel Holland’s book “The muses holocaust: or, A new burnt-offering to the tvvo great idols of presbytery and anabaptism”. So unless the Jews were scheming to blame Russia and Germany in the 1600s (when Germany didn't exist as a single state until the XIXth century.), there's really no correlation between the two.\n\n*Extra info*: Holocaust can actually be traced back all the way to the Ancient Greek translations of the *Old Testament*. However, due to the meaning of it being \"Sacrifice\",Jews prefer to use \"Shoah\" to describe the \"Holocaust\".\n\n# 2. There were 6 million (or a rough estimate) Jews in Russia\n\nThe last analysis which I decided to stop bothering with after analysing the first row was Russia's Jewish population. According to Nazis, it is strange how 6,000,000 Jews is talked about in Russia and then 6,000,000 died in Germany! Totally not a coincidence. Now if I'm thinking this right, according to the Neo-Nazis: The 6,000,000 toll was simply used by the Jews on everyone so they could smear them and demonize them for their actions. Guess the Jews threw the \"6,000,000\" until it sticked onto Germany, right?\n\n**No, not really:**\n[According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, Russia had 5 million Jews (Иудеи, Оба пола *)](http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_rel_97.php?reg=0). Regards to Eastern Europe, [around 8,000,000 Jews (p.12; Table 3) lived in Eastern Europe in 1900](http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=18536) {I'm sort of interested in this because I would like to know what was considered \"Eastern Europe\" in 1900,  could get a much more interesting result}.  According to 1918-1919 American Jewish Year book, [there were nearly 7,000,000 Jews in the Russian empire by 1913.]\n (http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1918_1919_7_Statistics.pdf) Finally, the  [October 25, 1915 Pittsburgh press article](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D4sfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OkkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1589%2C7559784) states there being about 6,5 million Jews living in Russia.\n\n# So, is it da jooos?????? Could it be the notorious Judenphysik?!\n\nTo conclude, the population of Jews in Russia was 6 million (Or a rough estimate during the time stated by those interviewed in the NYTimes article). There's about a 2-3 year difference between the articles and this statement released by the American Jewish Year Book Vol.15 (1913-1914) regards to the Russian Jewish population in 1908:\n&gt;For 1908 a calculation of the Jewish population is 6,045,690 (Z. f. D. und s. D. J., July-Aug., 1911).\n \n\nErgo the conspiracy behind Jews trying to implant a “6,000,000” and “Holocaust” on to a specific nation is false and is as plausible as King George III being the 1st president of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit and P.S; Forgot to mention the September 8th, 1935. Basically, it was a global conference held by 18 countries to discuss the Jewish question (with 3,500,000 Jews being represented by the Polish people). What were the other 17 countries? Unfortunately I couldn't find any info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6g54sq/til_hitler_claimed_to_have_been_spared_by_british/dinq1hy/\n\n&gt;Yeah back when wars were fought with battles where both armies lined up in two lines, walked towards each other until they were 30 feet apart and then just shot at each other until one side lost. It still amazes me the honor system was enough for both sides to be like \"We'll each form a tight human wall, give each other the easiest possible target and then see how much of each other we can kill.\" Such a proper way to die in agony.\n\nPeople generally are keen on 1. winning and 2. not dying. The idea that somehow our current tactical doctrine represents the pinnacle of military achievement and that everyone who came before us were idiots who couldn't comprehend the idea of cover or ambushes is way more popular than even common sense ought to dictate. \n\nExecuting solely modern style light infantry tactics with muskets on a Napoleonic era battlefield is a laughably stupid as lining up US Marines in 2003 shoulder to shoulder 40 inches behind the front rank in neat platoons to take Baghdad. \n\nLight infantry tactics were in the musket era useful for rapid ambushes against forces with insufficient calvary, for untrained guerillas who would then turn and run to the wood/hills before they could get closed with and in other situations where mobility was limited by terrain, or in situations where friendly line or cavalry units were near enough to deter a charge. Otherwise, a well disciplined line infantry or cavalry unit would simply face, fire, charge, and cut them down.\n\nPeople did that shit because it worked better than any other sort of tactics at the time. Around the era of the US civil war, rifling and easier designs and methods for reloading began to mean that you no longer needed 100 guys shooting all at once to have any chance at hitting a distant target, and better firepower and reload times meant that you could stop an advance or charging force with fire alone, instead of bayonets. Not because suddenly all military thinkers stopped being idiots. Though there were certainly people who figured it out earlier and others who didn't figure it out until the early 20th century. Even during the early US civil war, many commanders like \"Stonewall\" Jackson figured out that rifles meant that the defenders had the upper hand, so he tried figured out ways to bait the union troops to charge into his lines, and was able to defeat larger forces. However, by the end of the US Civil War, almost everyone else had caught on with a few exceptions.\n\nIf nearly every single person in the past did something a certain way, it may have not been the best way, but it was probably popular because it worked. Not because they were fucking morons or obsessed with honorable combat.\n\nEdit: I am incorrect regarding the specifics of Jackson. I don't know enough to say what the actual case was.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6fz17l/debunking_debunking_the_crusades/",
        "text": "* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8prwEJkJ3Ds\n \n* Essentially this is a video “debunking” myths about the Crusades. While I broadly agree with the general idea of the video in the sense that the Crusades impact is often exaggerated and used as false equivalencies, there are so many historical holes in the way Steven has created his argument that I feel it needed to be addressed.\n\n\n \n* 1:32 Steven refers to the Crusades proper as the “second” crusades with the argument that the Muslim jihads, were really the first. This of course ignores the fundamental difference between the concept of a Crusade and the concept of Jihad. Although both fall under the banner of a holy war, they are both different in motivation and execution. Jihads were a sort of justification for the expansion of Islamic Empires, a reasoning for the conquests that would inevitably occur with the creation of the powerful Arabian Emperor. Crusades on the other hand were meant as specific expeditions to seize strategic and culturally significant targets rather than a justification for general expansion. They are of course still holy wars but I think calling the first age of Jihad the original Crusade is frankly false.\n \n\n* 1:45 While it is true that many of the Crusades were done with the purposes of liberating  Christian holy sites and defending from Islamic expansion some were Christians attacking non christians and/or heretics because they were weaker or of another faith. Notable examples being the Northern Crusades which were far from defensive. These were not wars against a massive threat but were rather attacks on neighboring pagans. Or the Hussite Crusades which sought to put down the heretical Hussite beliefs in Bohemia, both at least somewhat fit the bill on Christians going around the world killing and conquering non christians for offensive purposes. \n\n \n* 2:30 This will come up more a bit later but the era of Ottoman aggression in the Christian Balkans was after the golden age of Crusading which most consider to have ended in the late 12000s while Muslim expansion in europe took place in the early 1400s meaning that Ottoman aggression was not a factor in the initial outbreak or even the continuation of real Crusades. Sure a few Crusades were called on the Ottomans but they were much smaller affairs than the massive expeditions of previous centuries and many scholars don't even consider them Crusades proper.\n \n* 2:47 The sacking of Constantinople was not the “big” reason for the Crusades, the first Crusade was called in 1096 in response to Turkish expansion into eastern anatolia, not the sacking of Constantinople which was in 1453 almost 300 year later. \n \n* 3:13 There wasn't anything especially brutal about Islamic expansion, it was rather standard for the time with notable exceptions of course. But as a whole these conquests were relatively normal. In fact many Islamic military practices could be considered much more tolerant for the time, including the lack of forced conversions and the protection of Christians and Jews, as so called People of The Book. The example he cites as being especially brutal being the desecration of the Tombs of 2 saints was also not exceptional for the time and the destruction of Holy Sites as a result of conquests was done by various conquerors Islamic and not, including many Christians.  \n\n \n* 3:20 “Dick move” is not a military term \n\n \n* 3:27 Islamic torturing was not exceptional for the time, many cultures had extremely brutal techniques for torturing and killing individuals at the time. There's a reason the term “going medieval on someone” exists.\n\n\n\n \n* 3:32 The use of the Jizya tax and the second class citizen status of non-muslims was a problem for individuals living in Muslim controlled areas, but these were still relatively humane compared to the ways many non state religious followers were treated at the same time in other regions of the world Jewish pogroms and pagan conversions by the sword come to mind.\n\n\n\n\n* 3:50 Yes the Muslim slave trade was a massively catastrophic for millions of people, but it also was, once again hardly exceptional for the time. It should also be noted that he talks about how the we don't talk about the Muslim slave trade in American history courses. This is more so due to the trans-atlantic slave trades relevance of American history specifically and the continued massive role it plays in modern American society. \n\n\n \n* 4:47 Vlad was not one of the few people who fought off Islamic expansion. Hundreds of leaders have fought off Muslim expansion into the west whether it be Charles the Hammer at the battle of Tours or the generations of Spanish kings who participated in the Reconquista, or Norman conquest of Sicily. These and many more fought against Islamic expansion and I think it is flatly wrong to assume that Vlad was one of the few who noticed the threat of Islam. Also he existed years after the major Crusades occurred so he was following in a long tradition of fighting of the Muslims\n\n\n \n* 5:13 When Pope Urban II called the first crusade he was not doing so because the Muslims were going to eradicate his culture, to him the threat of Islamic Empires moving into West Europe was a far off possibility. What he wanted was to improve relations with the Eastern Christians after the great schism and unite Christianity with conquest of Jerusalem not preserve his culture and way of life. \n\n\n \n* 5:42 The barbarism of the Crusades while certainly not  a sole factor in Islamic distaste for the west, is still most definitely a contributing factor. From their perspective the west has a long history of meddling in Middle Eastern affairs notably with recent colonialism and interferences in local government. While it probably doesn't shape their view of the West it certainly contributes to the narrative of western intervention \n\n\n \n* 6:01 While the Christians were technically “taking back” Jerusalem it is worth noting that the Muslims had been living there for the last 500 years and were firmly entrenched in the territory. The Muslims in Jerusalem had lived there for generations. It is also worth noting that the Christians weren't even the original owners of Jerusalem it was built by the Israelites in the age of antiquity and has passed hand dozens of times since then, the Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and Jews had just as much of claim on Jerusalem as the Christians\n\n\n \n* 6:15 It was Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon who were teaming on Israel \n\n\n \n* 6:30 The blood up to their knees account while scientifically inaccurate was taken from exaggerated sources from the time and isn't taken literally by most people also just because the streets weren't literally flooding with blood doesn't mean it wasn't a slaughter the entire population was nearly wiped out \n\n\n \n* 7:02 I find it ironic that he says that he talks about how the sacking of Jerusalem wasn't that bad and mentions how a Synagogue was destroyed and it members killed, while earlier in the video he discusses how the desecration of religious sites was the sign of the ultimate brutality of Islam \n\n\n \n* 7:40 I highly doubt they teach the “blood up to their knees” comment  literally or maybe Steven has been taking some really bad classes. \n\n\n \n* 8:00 Just because it was standard for siegers to offer deals ahead of time does not that the Sack of Jerusalem wasn't horribly brutal for the time because it was. It has gone down in history as a mythic display of destruction. Plus dring most sieges the entire population would be almost completely annihilated. \n\n\n \n* 9:20 Once again the Crusades were not intended to stop Islamic “barbarism”. Also I would hardly call them necessary when they barely accomplished anything in terms of halting Islamic expansion. In fact I’d argue that it helped Islamic expansion by crippling the important barrier between the east and west that was the Byzantine Empire during the 4th Crusade allowing the Ottomans to fill the power vacuum and push into Europe, as far as even Austria up until the 1800s.\n\n\n \n* 9:34 The Armenian Genocide while a massive tragedy did not occur because the Ottomans were Muslim and therefore barbaric, ethnic cleansings while terrible, but were not completely extraordinary for the time (though the Armenian one was especially brutal) one simple needs to look a the Holocaust which was perpetuated by many Western European Christians to see that the Ottomans were not unique because they were Muslims. \n\n\n \n* 10:01 While it is terrible than brutal executions for seemingly small crimes is a terrible thing to be happening today in the Middle East let us not forget that the these concepts were still widespread through Europe until only the last century where they fell into decline. Let us not forget that the last public Guillotine execution in France was in only 1939 less than a century ago.\n\n\n \n* 10:14 Public executions in stadiums weren't a “a warm up act” moreso stadiums are just a convenient venue to kill someone in front of a bunch of people \n\n\n \n* 10:23 Islamic brutality once again was not the sole motivation for the Crusades while the killing of Pilgrims was a large outrage prior to the Crusades evidence has shown that these reports were exaggerated and this was only one small piece of the puzzle of motivations for the Crusades.\n\n\n \n* 10:31 Being really horrible to people was the entire world back then, everyone was kind of shitty to each other Europe included. Public executions were considered public entertainment back then. \n\n\n \n* 11:04 The Islamic World does make progress you dumbass, the Islamic Golden Age was a massive step forward for art, culture,and the sciences, and was a massive inspiration on European progress during the Renaissance. I’m to tired to list individual achievements but let's just say that we wouldn't be in the place we are today without Islamic advancements in all fields. \n\n\n \n* 11:15 NOT CRUSADES, JIHADS\n\n\n \n* 11:37 No Christians were not advancing into the new world before the Crusades, the age colonization did not take place until the late 1400s way after the Crusades were called. And if you mean New World figuratively it's still wrong. The development of western culture and sciences while often exaggeratedly so was still stunted during the dark ages.  It's not like they had to postpone their advancements to go stop the Muslims or something. Plus the Crusades actually pushed Western Culture forward after the end of the wars with renewed contact with the east. \n\n\n \n* 11:50   NOT CRUSADES, THEY WERE JIHADS\n\n\n \n* 11:58: Arguably that stunting of Islamic development was at least in part because of Western Colonialism, the West did divide the Middle East after WWI creating many conflicts and propping up anti development dictators. JUS SAYIN\n\n\n \n* OK finally done, hope you all enjoyed this and sorry for the Grammar errors, it's really not my strong suit. \n\n\nEdited: Formatting and restructured some sentences as well fixed some grammers",

I am not expecting that the porn industry would be really into historical realism. I am sure you can find the bad examples yourselves with your ~~experience~~ research skills. One non-pornographic example was Xena's \"[Ides of March](http://hercules-xena.wikia.com/wiki/The_Ides_of_March)\"\n\nCrucifixion. The poet and statesman said that it is a word that should not even be on the lips of a good roman citizen, it was an execution so horrid that it was meant to send a point.\n\nWere females even crucified? Yes. They were. Albeit not in the same number that men were. However, there was usually a public outcry whenever women were to be executed in this manner, there have been many letters of clemency unearthed giving sex as the reason. \n\nFrom Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews\n\n&gt; Mundus had a freedwoman, who had been made free by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all sorts of mischief ... Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the priests about it, and ordered them to be crucified, as well as Ide, who was the occasion of their perdition. (18:3) \n\nPart of Roman law was that if a slave owner was murdered than **every** slave was put to the cross regardless of guilt. There were examples of hundreds of slaves being put out to the cross over one death.\n\n\n &gt;   Up to the time of Nero, in Rome the collective execution of all slaves on the premises where one slave had killed the master seems to have been undisputed. Under this emperor, in 61 C.E., a minority of the Senate in vain attempted to prevent a crucifixion of 400 slaves of the household of Pedanius Secundus, the prefect of Rome.\n\n(Barth, Markus, and Helmut Blanke. The letter to Philemon: A new translation with notes and commentary. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000.)\n\n\nThere were two exemptions for female crucifixion -\n\n1. You were a Roman citizen\n2. You were a virgin (It was the job of the soldiers to ensure that all of the condemned were not virgins between arrest and execution)\n\nSo, the fact that there is female crucifixion is not the purpose of this post, then what is?\n\nAccording to my sources, females were hung facing towards the stipes, rather than outwards like men were. Sure there is a lot of variation in how the condemned were hung (saltires. Y beams, traditional crosses), but it appears as sources agree.\n\n\nAnother thing is that the act of crucifixion was meant as a public humiliation, rather than done in some basement torture chamber, but I digress there. \n\nEdit  - My source for this last part comes from a poorly translated show on History Channel's Spanish affiliate, so I am looking into their sources. \n\nCrucifixion does not appear in non-christian art, and apart from Christ and the saints, does not appear in Christian art. So, sourcing these claims can be difficult, I would love to see some counter bad history. \n\nThe closest thing I could find was from the early 1500's as [The Crucifixion of Saint Julia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/%D0%A1%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%98%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%285743699974%29.jpg)\n\nEdit 2 - My post refers to the roman practice only, there are several variations. Such as the northern tribes not using a petibullum, only the stipes.",

We have likewise sanitised history to exclude the voices of African Americans who loudly protested the use of nuclear weapons, connecting them to American colonialism abroad and racism at home.\n\n\n&gt;Why did the United States not drop the atomic bomb on Germany or Italy? The answer can be found in the appalling and vitriolic anti-Japanese sentiment, whipped up to dehumanize an entire population.\n\n\n&gt;This month 71 years ago, the US cropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on August 6 and 9 respectively.\n'Racism' is probably not the first word that springs to mind as we reflect on these terrible events, and their immediate and ongoign aftermath.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;But the underpinnings of racism are glaringly obvious. Intondi quotes poet Langston Hughes asking the question voiced by many others; why did the United States not drop the atomic bomb on Germany or Italy?\n\n\n\n&gt;the answer can be found in the appalling and vitriolic anti-Japanese sentiment Intondi cites, whipped up to dehumanize an entire population. This includes the illustrious Time magazine which declared that \"The ordinary unreasoning Jap is ignorant. Perhaps he is human. Nothing ... indicates it.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough I won't deny there was pretty extreme racism and propoganda around at the time, the reason the U.S. dropped the bomb on Japan and not Italy or Germany, [was because they](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-surrenders-unconditionally-to-the-allies-at-reims) had [already surrendered by then](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/oct-13-1943-italy-switches-sides-in-world-war-ii/comment-page-1/) (in 1943 and on May 7th, 1945 respectively) and there was no strategic reason to do so. The Manhattan project also began in [late 1941](http://www.ushistory.org/us/51f.asp) and [wasn't finished until 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project), [but the bombs were finished in august 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) after both had already surrendered. If Germany had stuck around, the U.S. likely would have used the bomb on them.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6femey/miami_in_1986_fast_cars_crime_waves_and_the_music/",
        "text": "Ah, 1986.  The year began with the Oklahoma Sooners winning a national championship in college football, led by freshman quarterback Jamelle Holieway.  Their only blemish during that season was a loss to the Miami Hurricanes.  Soon afterward, the Chicago Bears shuffled their way into a Super Bowl title, with their only loss during the season being to the Miami Dolphins.  And on TV, the second season of “Miami Vice” gave way to a third, introducing the Ferrari Testarossa with it.  In 1986, everything went through Miami.\n\nIn 2002, the introduction of “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City” on the Sony PlayStation 2 resurrected the world of Miami from 1986: bright colors, t-shirts under Armani jackets, fast cars, faster women, and crime.  Central to the plot of the game are the vehicles themselves, which mirror the styles of the time while carrying altered names.  The city itself has an altered name though, with “Vice City” standing in for “Miami”.  But…it’s pretty obviously Miami.\n\nWhat hasn’t been altered, though, is the music emanating from the in-car stereos.  It’s possible for a player to carjack some hapless soul, then peel away while a fresh single like “Yankee Rose” blasts from the radio.  Don’t like it?  Change stations and feel the over-wrought heartbreak from Mr. Mister and “Broken Wings”.  Feel like embracing the New Wave?  Switch over to Wave 103 and see if you can catch the tail end of Thomas Dolby’s “Hyperactive!” before it fades into “Two Tribes” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  All told, there are nine in-game radio stations, seven playing easily-recognizable hits of the 1980s (and some from the 1970s).\n\nOf course, there’s more to the game than simply joyriding, committing felonies, and listening to awesome music.  There are storylines to explore, missions to complete, and a crime empire to build.\nEarly on, [we’re told that half of Vice City is facing the imminent threat of a hurricane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oamvZ1TCNWk) and is closed from access.  It seems that this hurricane, named either Hermine or Hermione, is packing a serious wallop.  That can only mean one thing: stay out of the closed part of the city.  As gameplay progresses, the warning is lifted and the other half of the city is open to bring your one-man crime wave to.  But for now, a fierce hurricane is threatening to dampen everything.\n\nIn sharp contrast to some later years, the 1986 Atlantic hurricane season was a fairly mild one.  The first actual hurricane, Bonnie, was a Category 1 storm that made landfall in late June.  Charley, another Category 1, came after that in mid-August.  Although rainfall in the United States was relatively minor, the storm would eventually make its way all the way back across the Atlantic and bring record rainfall to Ireland.  In September, Hurricane Earl became the first storm of the 1986 season to reach Category 2 status, but it stalled well east of the eastern coast of the United States and drifted northward before dissipating.  Things were calm for another two months, until Frances formed and officially reached hurricane status on November 20.  It lasted as a hurricane for just a single day before being absorbed by another storm, having never come close to landfall.  This brought the hurricane season to a close; Georges was slated to be the next name used, then Hermine, but neither were necessary.\n\nHermine, or Hermione, is the incoming hurricane that’s mentioned in our game.  Now, obviously we can’t go *too* far into this because it’s a necessary plot device, and because people like us would have a field day if the game designers went with an actual hurricane.  We’d be sitting here 15 years later, carefully analyzing rainfall patterns from 1986 and trying to match them to the game.  But the real downside is that using an earlier hurricane would have cut out a decent chunk of the phenomenal in-game soundtracks because the release dates, and in some cases the recording dates, would have come after the fact.\n\nSince Hurricane Frances formed in mid-November, we can safely date the expected threat date of our in-game hurricane to have been sometime after November 20, but before the end of the year.  It is, after all, 1986 through and through.\n\nWhich takes us back to the TV show “Miami Vice”.  It wasn’t just the cars or Don Johnson or the fast action that fueled the popularity of the show; it was the music.  Major artists like Glenn Frey were writing and performing songs specifically for the show and having enormous chart success with them.  “You Belong to The City”, one such song that became a Frey classic, topped the *Billboard* Top Rock charts.  The initial soundtrack release after the show’s first season, named simply *Miami Vice*, hit #1 on the charts the week that it was released.  All told, it would spend eleven weeks in that spot and sell over four million copies.\n\nThe backbone of the show’s musical genius was a Czechoslovakian-born musician named Jan Hammer, who left home shortly after the 1968 Revolution.  Less than 20 years later, he was the one responsible for *five* of the eleven tracks on the top-selling album.  The theme song for the show went to #1 on the charts and earned Hammer two Grammys (Best Pop Instrumental Performance and Best Instrumental Composition) in February 1986, just months before the events of “Vice City” were to take place.\n\nHammer wasn’t just responsible for the theme song and working other popular songs in, though.  He was tasked with scoring entire episodes where music would be necessary, which meant that there would be some recurring music.  One of the best known pieces, “Crockett’s Theme”, was used sporadically during scenes involving Sonny Crockett (played by Don Johnson, who in 1986 would look for a “Heartbeat”).  “Crockett’s Theme” first appeared in Season 1’s [episode “Calderone’s Return (Part I)”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiSSCjPYMM8), which originally aired October 19, 1984.  This scene lasts barely a minute, while [the song that we hear on Emotion 98.3 in Vice City is a full-length single]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNzialPtrxU) starting at 42:00.  There are also minor differences in the music itself, so what was on the radio wasn’t even the same piece as what had been originally used two years prior.\n\nThe best-known usage of “Crockett’s Theme” came two years later in the episode “Stone’s War”, which aired on October 3, 1986.  In this particular episode, Crockett takes Castillo to task over the fact that with his previous high-end vehicle destroyed, he’s been trying to infiltrate high-dollar drug gangs in decidedly low-dollar vehicles.  As the tension rises, Castillo simply says, “It’s out back”, and Crockett goes outside to see a brand new Ferrari Testarossa waiting for him.  [As he admires the top-of-the-line car, Hammer’s new version of “Crockett’s Theme” becomes increasingly loud]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF0a8ssdaDU), reaching a crescendo when Crockett revs the engine.\n\nTo me, there’s a certain amount of pleasure that can be taken from carjacking someone in “GTA: Vice City”, taking their sweet ride, and finding that they left the radio on the station that you wanted and it’s playing the perfect song.  When it comes to pilfering a [Cheetah](http://media.gtanet.com/gtavice/images/content/vehicles/cheetah.jpg), which is what the in-game version of [the Testarossa](https://cdn04.carsforsale.com/3/1006955/10447695/thumb/887916434.jpg) is, there’s nothing better than peeling out while “Crockett’s Theme” plays at maximum volume.  And then you run over a row of in-game hookers loitering on a street corner, which I don’t think Crockett ever did in Miami Vice.  But it’s been 30 years, so my memory is slightly fuzzy.\n\nWhen the “Stone’s War” episode aired in October, Hurricane Earl was a distant memory and Frances still a month away.  But a second soundtrack to the TV show, simply called *Miami Vice II*, was slated for release.\n\nFrances went from a tropical storm to a hurricane on November 20; this was the last hurricane of the 1986 Atlantic season.  Georges and Hermione were never used, as they never formed.  Of course, a certain amount of artistic license can be taken, since this is a video game after all.\nRegardless, it would be reasonable to deduce that the hurricane that threatens Vice City would come after November 20, and most likely sometime in December.  This creates issues with two songs featured on the in-game radio.\n\nFirst is “Cumin’ Atcha Live” by Tesla, featured on the station V-Rock.  Almost entirely unknown for most of 1986, Tesla recorded their debut album (*Mechanical Resonance*) and had it out before Christmas.  The album hit shelves on December 8, 1986, just in time for Al Gore to groan and wish that he’d just beaten Dee Snider and the rest of those no-goodnik rockers into submission two years prior.  “Cumin’ Atcha Live” was actually the B-side to “Little Suzi”, but the single wasn’t released until early 1987.  That said, it’s very possible that an enterprising DJ in 1986 would have picked up *Mechanical Resonance* and played a handful of songs on the radio before the initial single was first officially released.  It’s a tight squeeze to reconcile Christmas shopping with a hurricane threat, but it’s possible.\n\nThe second issue, though, is with the album cut of “Crockett’s Theme”.  The version featured on Emotion 98.3 is the full-length one, whereas the only version that audiences would have heard was from a 54-second clip in a single episode that revealed the Testarossa to the world.  No problem though, since *Miami Vice II* was about to be released.\n\nIn this case, however, the single of “Crockett’s Theme” wasn’t released until well into 1987.  And the album itself, *Miami Vice II*, did **not** make it out in time for Christmas; it wasn’t released until December 29.  In order for Emotion 98.3 DJ Fernando to have played the album cut version of “Crockett’s Theme” in 1986 would mean that the events of “GTA: Vice City” began in the last three days of 1986.\n\nTime elapses in-game at a rate of one minute per second, but [one YouTube video actually speeds this up even further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBxe2ZJnqs) by time-lapsing one hour in-game to one second of real time.  From this, we can see that the sun doesn’t really start setting until after 8 PM in-game, and it doesn’t *really* start getting dark until after 9:30 PM.  Although there is inconsistent weather during any particular day in Vice City, with storms and overcast weather just as likely as bright and sunny cloudless days, **the sunrise and sunset times are the same from day to day**.\n\nThankfully, the US Naval Observatory maintains archives of sunrise and sunset data going back decades.  And [from Miami on December 29, 1986](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/rstt/onedaytable?ID=AA&amp;year=1986&amp;month=12&amp;day=29&amp;state=FL&amp;place=miami), we can clearly see a sunset of 5:39 PM and a civil twilight of 6:05 PM.  On [December 30](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/rstt/onedaytable?ID=AA&amp;year=1986&amp;month=12&amp;day=30&amp;state=FL&amp;place=miami), sunset was at 5:40 PM and civil twilight 6:05 PM.  And on New Year’s Eve 1986, which would seem unlikely for this game due to a complete lack of any New Year’s festivities, [we see a 5:41 PM sunset and a 6:06 PM civil twilight](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/rstt/onedaytable?ID=AA&amp;year=1986&amp;month=12&amp;day=31&amp;state=FL&amp;place=miami).\n\nThe conclusion is unmistakable.  A full-length version of “Crockett’s Theme” could *not* have been played on Emotion 98.3 at any point in the calendar year 1986 around the time of an incoming hurricane as depicted in “GTA: Vice City”, and therefore should not have been featured if accuracy were to be maintained.\n\n**Tl;dr** - In Vice City, “Crockett’s Theme” is a crock\n",

As an additional factor, Pakistani soldiers generally use Islam as a unifying force and it'll take a lot to get them to massacre Muslims.\n\n\n\nThat settles it, no genocide took place. The Pakistani army will never take actions against fellow Muslims. No one has the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I suppose this is the point where you throw 5,6 propaganda links at me and tell me to go read them.

What I say is the truth. Trust me I'm reading a second, boring and technical book. :/\n\n\n\n\nFor Rule 5, I will cite [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) and a couple recent articles: [1,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-war-bangladesh-can-never-forget-8501636.html) [2.](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/when-the-black-night-fell-46-years-ago/article17665699.ece) This is a predominantly accepted historical event. March 25 has also been declared a Genocide Remembrance Day in Bangladesh. Pakistan estimates around 26,000 people were killed and 2 million refugees fled to India, while Bangladesh estimates 3 million deaths. The generally accepted consensus is ~1.5million, and the situation would have likely been a lot worse without India's intervention, or even if it was just delayed by a few months. There are many survivors/witness detailing the existence of rape harems, unspeakable brutality and pure callousness by the Pakistani establishment, and historians have compared this to the Nanking Massacre conducted by Japan. The Pakistani President General Yahya Khan is also attributed this chilling statement: “Kill three million of them, and the rest will eat out of our hands.”\n\n\n\nInteresting historical tidbit: India's intervention was considered controversial by the West because it was perceived as being close to the Soviets. This was at the heights of the Cold War, and Pakistan was  viewed as a counterweight to India, which was leading the Non-Aligned-Movement at the time. In response to India's proposal to intervene on humanitarian grounds and to stem the flow of millions of refugees, the US sent a nuclear-armed aircraft carrier group, with an UK fleet in tow. They were under orders to immediately engage and start attacking Indian army positions. China was also asked to attack from the North, or at a minimum create pressure with troop movements. At India's request, Russia intervened. The US and UK fleets were greeted by Russian nuclear submarines surfacing at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, with further ships in the distance. I believe this is one of the lesser known standoffs of the Cold War.

I think there are three big issues that we need to understand for badhistory to flourish.\n\n##Wheres the Content?\n\nIts no secret to long timers that badhistory has left the golden age of posts. While it isn't too much of a graveyard now, the days of 300 comment monday/thursday (DEA remember Thursday threads?) are gone and they are lucky to reach 100. Same goes with posts, as we get around 4-7 posts a week instead of the ~20 of old. \n\nI (personally) think I have a couple reasons why we slowed down:\n\n1. Phones. Yeah the iPhone has been around for years, but now a large number solely go on reddit, and surf the web on their phone. This makes it harder for people to convince themselves to make a post, either by typing it up on a shitty keyboard or to sit down on their computer. It also hamstrings finding and correcting badhistory, as its harder to surf the web for lots of information on your phone. \n\n2. History. We used to have the moratorium, where we outlawed 3 topics a month because things got repetitive. We binned it for now as we don't have nearly as much repeat posts as we use to. BUT, history is history. The majority of us have all read a post on the lost cause, or on Rommel, or why Rome well. Maybe we have just ran our course on all the easy shit, and no-one really wants to be person #23 to do the same topic, and people don't want to read post #234 about it either. We only have so much history in the public mind that people can get wrong, that it is hard to have a steady stream of new stuff!\n\nI am interested in other people's take on this. I also want to stress that traffic != good. Its OKAY if we take it easy for a while. As long as we are having fun. \n\n##Politicized Content. \n\nThis has been a 'newish' gripe that has come up for obvious reasons. But it is hard to tackle. I am of the group that there **should** be posts on politicians (of any group) when they say historical inaccurate things. That's kinda why we are here. The main problem is that the posts must focus on the HISTORY and not the person's political ideology. It could be a test where I replace the source of the inaccuracy with another name and the post should still make complete sense. Now, the public has spoken and the majority wish for good content. So the moderators may be strict on near shitposts on these issues. \n\nModerators have just added 'soapboxing' to the rules page. Its a last case scenario where a post is more for advocating a position, than correcting history. I expect this to be rarely used, if at all, and we do not want to use unless necessary. \n\nOnce again, I am eager to hear your opinions and thoughts on these issues. \n\n## Badhistory Duality\n\nOkay, Badhistory is two faces of the same coin. On one hand we have massive R5 heavy breakdowns, which I love. On the other we have funny, shorter, but still informative breakdowns which I also love. Some people prefer one over the other, and that's fine. But we have a contradicting environment here of a fun, history related community that just wants to shoot the shit and people who love to post detailed breakdowns and bath themselves in sources. We cater to both here, and as the questions above show, most people like this style. It just means we have to keep an open mind about the type of content we don't like, but not go overboard so we push out the others. The one thing tying these sides together is this: Educational. People should learn, or relearn, something from every post, be it the true name of St. Willburts third horse or the amount of steel needed to build a battleship, or even if it was truly snowing that one fateful Christmas. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nJust wanted to say Thank You! It because of the posters and the commentators that make this place fantastic. We added 'Valued Comment' flair just because some of our fellow BadHistorians are so great at bringing up new perspectives and sources in a respectful way. Its just great seeing this community interact. So thank you!\n\nPlease use the comments to discuss any findings or questions, and ask moderators about any issues/thoughts/recommendations you have. ",

        "text": "I started my day today by opening up the New York Times to see what was happening in the world. A column caught my eye, and against my better judgement, [I clicked on it and took a look.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/opinion/sunday/trumps-incompetence-wont-save-our-democracy.html)\n\nBasically, the column argues that Trump shouldn't be seen as an evil mastermind. Fairly standard NYT stuff that makes me wonder why I bother reading it anymore, but you get the idea. But early on, the author drops this lovely little paragraph:\n\n&gt;We imagine the villains of history as cunning strategists, brilliant masterminds of horror. This happens because we learn about them from history books, which weave narratives that retrospectively imbue events with logic, making them seem predetermined. \n\nFirst of all, what books are you reading that constantly turn people like Hitler and Stalin into evil masterminds? I'm fairly sure that the historical consensus is that Hitler was incompetent and that Stalin was paranoid, and that their brilliance was limited to political savviness and charisma. You'd be hard pressed to find any serious Hitler biographers arguing that he was a \"mastermind of horror,\" some brilliant strategist who carefully crafted all of the Nazi's crimes by herself. There's more to the spectrum of Nazi historiography that extreme intentionalist!\n\nSecond of all, I'm fairly sure the author confused \"make sense of how Event A resulted in Event B\" with teleology, given his use of the word \"predetermined\". This doesn't bode well for the authors they're reading – I don't trust anyone who hasn't had the phrase _teleology is a mortal sin_ beaten into them before they sit down at a keyboard.\n\n&gt;Historians and their readers bring an unavoidable perception bias to the story: If a historical event caused shocking destruction, then the person behind this event must have been a correspondingly giant monster. \n\nUuuuugh.\n\nThere certainly are [works that demonize these leaders, of course.](https://www.amazon.com/Mao-Story-Jung-Chang/dp/0679746323) And yes, [sometimes these demonizations can influence the field.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Terror) But to argue that historians as a whole do this is just disrespectful, and shows that either the author hasn't read many serious biographies or wanted to throw out a narrative for the rest of their think piece.",

The arrival of Christianity as the state religion of Rome coincided with\n\n&gt;The end of religious toleration that had been a feature of late antiquity.\n\n&gt;Scientific inquiry was actively discouraged, e.g. \"the scientific study of the heavens should be neglected for wherein does it aid our salvation\" Ambrose, bishop of Milan (the then capital of the Western Empire).\n\n&gt;The notion of a spherical Earth ridiculed. In response to, and 300 years after, Pliny's claim that Earth was spherical; \"is there anyone so senseless to believe that there are men whose footsteps are higher than their heads, and that crops and trees grow downwards, that rains and snow, and hail fall upwards towards the Earth\". Latinus. This became Church doctrine, and to believe in a spherical Earth was heresy, as exampled by the heresy of Verigilius in 748.\nThe dialectical method of Aristotle disappeared and was outlawed, \"there can be no dialogue with God\". The works of Aristotle vanish from the Western world.\n\n&gt;The Platonic Academy in Athens was closed as philosophical speculation was an aid to heretics. A whole generation of scholars fled East.\n\n&gt;The works of Galen, who argued that a supreme god had created the human body \"with a purpose to which all its parts tended\" were deemed in accord with scripture, they were then collected into 16 volumes of unassailable dogma. The scientific or empirical study of medicine was abandoned for more than a thousand years, with magic substituting. Medicine did not begin to crawl out of the mire of religion until the arrival of brave men such as Paracelsus, who was persecuted for actually attempting empirical study of medicine. The Greeks had made an initial attempt to ascribe natural causes to disease, for example Hypocrites attempted to show a natural cause for epilepsy yet in the 14th century Christian \"physicians\" were still prescribing reading the Gospels over the afflicted (this type of rubbish is still going on).\n\n&gt;Some examples of this absurd thinking John Chrysostom: \"Restrain your own reasoning, and empty your mind of secular learning\".\n\n&gt;Lactantius: \"What purpose does knowledge serve - for as to knowledge of natural causes, what blessing is there for me if I should know where the Nile rises, or whatever else under the heavens the scientists' rave about?\"\n\n&gt;Philastrius of Brescia: \"There is a certain heresy concerning earthquakes that they come not from God's command, but, it is thought, from the very nature of the elements!\"\n\n&gt;Books themselves became objects of fear for they might not accord with dogma. The historian Amamianus Marcellinus discussing the actions of Valens tells us of book owners burning their entire libraries out of fear that they themselves might be burnt by Christians! And that Valens greatly diminished our knowledge of ancient writers.\n\n&gt;Basil of Caesarea: \"Now we have no more meetings, no more debates, no more gatherings of wise men in the Agora, nothing more of all that made our city famous\".\n\n&gt;By the middle of the 4th century every lending library in Rome was closed. According to the historian Luciano Canfora Rome was devoid of books.\n\n&gt;The great library of Serapis was destroyed by the Christian Archbishop of Alexandria. The Mouseion Library survived because it contained mostly Christian books (poorly copied because even literacy itself had greatly suffered under the heel of theocracy). Not to worry though it was destroyed by Muslim invaders \"if their content is in accord with book of Allah we can do without them, if not there is no need to preserve them\".\n\n&gt;In the 6th century compiling his Etymologies Isadore of Seville lamented \"The authors stood like blue hills on the far horizon and now it is difficult to place them even chronologically\".\n\n&gt;By the middle of the 6th century only 2 schools of classical learning survived.\n\n&gt;From the end of the 6th century to the middle of the 9th century there is no record of classical education in the West, and hardly any record of education at all.\n\n&gt;The boot heel of theocracy was pressed on the throat of the Western world for a 1000 years, when the pressure was finally released almost immediately we had the Renaissance , the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution. And every advance in the rights of man since has been in spite of the church which had to be dragged kicking and screaming all the while trying to claw humanity back into its mire.\n\nThe problem is that he's using specific cherry-picking examples and downright incorrect informations to justify that as if all people had the same viewpoint. Some examples:\n\n * Even during the early Middle Ages, virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint first expressed by the Ancient Greeks yet he's perpetuating that myth here. (The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the Earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching. ... Atheists and agnostics championed the conflict thesis for their own purposes, but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict. - James Hannam)\n\n * From what I researched Vergilius was accused not because of round earth but mostly the fact that he believed in \"other worlds\" and differing viewpoints on original sin. Also he died peacefully in the age of 82.\n\n * And dialectical method of Aristotle outlawed and even his works  disappeared entirely? Except tons of medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas was directly influenced by him?\n\n * Platonic Academy in Athens was destroyed by siege in 86BC. This is just downright lying.\n\n * While faith healing was popular, Hippocratic medicine was still widely used. Also it's not like Greeks didn't use faith healing.\n\n * And the fucking Library of Alexandria, of course\n\n(Would be appreciated if someone points out more)",
