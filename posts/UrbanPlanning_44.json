The goal of the study is to develop a method which quantifies and measures how accessible a specific solution is (Solution: elevator/stair/cable car/escalator). \n\nThe part i need help with is the process of finding specific projects where dramatic topography (height difference of 10-40 meters) has been overcome by clever solutions. Clever solutions could be any solution that can handle a significant flow of people that connects two points that are separated by a distinct difference in height. These solutions can be from all over the globe. \n\nTwo examples of solutions are presented below.\n\n[Elevator/Stair solution in Stockholm, Sweden](http://www.bau.se/case/vertikalen-kvarnholmen/)\n\n[Funicular in Montmartre, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre_Funicular)\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated! Even if there is no specific solution present, an example of an urban area that has handled difficult topography well is also appreciated! \n",

I thought about this while watching a father talk to Donald Trump about the death of his daughter in the shooting. He seemingly was advocating putting in metal detectors and locking down schools completely, like courtrooms or airports currently are locked down. Yet everyday across the USA six parents of teenagers a similar age to his daughter find out that their child has died. And this is generally considered acceptable. While cities are attempting to implement Vision Zero, this isn't a discussion in the suburbs and has received incredible backlash in places like Los Angeles. ",

I predict I'll be working on projects located in California and surrounding areas. \n\nMy growing areas of expertise are bike/ped planning, sustainable, transport modeling, data science, data viz, and GIS.\n\nSo far I have...\n\n- Vision Zero documents\n- local urban planning master plans \n- Caltrans' Strategic Management Plan 2015-2020\n- Senate Bill 743, and associated technical documents\n- Previous TIA assessment legislation and technical documents (CEQA compliance)\n\nAny suggests (perhaps with thoughts on priority) would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you in advance. \n ",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI have the possibility to move to Canada at the end of the year, and I am currently a practicing planner in Brisbane, Aus.\n\nI've looked at job postings and they seem achievable experience-wise, although I will still need to learn the intricacies of the Canadian planning system before getting offered a job.\n\nMy question is firstly, if anyone is a planner working in Canada - what advice would you give to someone new to the country knowing very little about your planning system?\n\nAlso if anyone knows places I can go to to give me an overview of planning in Canada (I know the usual - Wikipedia/google/etc. - I am looking more for skills-based advice to make myself more attractive to the potential employer). I have time, I will hopefully be moving in about October.\n\nThank you everyone!",
