        "text": "Dear admissions committee,\n\nI'm not very good at this whole personal statement thing, so bear with me. I guess what I want to say is that I've always been interested in people and their minds. But it's not like I want to be some kind of big-shot doctor or anything. I just want to understand why people do the things they do.\n\nI've spent a lot of time over the years trying to figure out my own mind, and it's been a pretty rough road. But I've learned a lot about myself in the process, and I think that makes me better equipped to understand other people too.\n\nSee, I'm not really interested in the textbooks and the academic side of psychiatry. I mean, sure, I'll do the reading and learn what I need to learn. But what really matters to me is connecting with the people I'm trying to help.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in therapy myself, and I know how hard it can be to open up and trust someone with your thoughts and feelings. But I also know how much it can help when you find someone who really gets it.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to be some kind of distant, clinical psychiatrist. I want to be the kind of doctor who really listens and cares about their patients. The kind of doctor who can sit down with someone and really understand what they're going through, even if it's messy and complicated and doesn't fit neatly into a textbook.\n\nI know I have a lot to learn, and I'm not always the easiest person to work with. But I'm passionate about this field, and I'm willing to put in the work to become the best psychiatrist I can be.\n\nSo if you're looking for someone who's going to be a cookie-cutter resident, I'm probably not your guy. But if you want someone who's going to put their heart and soul into this work, who's going to really try to make a difference in people's lives, then I hope you'll consider me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHolden",

I'm talking about work room or idle staff-to-staff conversation, usually with the implication the patient was irresponsible for continuing to have children and should be prevented from doing so further. This happened very flippantly several times on my rotation and it made me extremely uncomfortable, especially as this seemed to be disproportionately applied to brown Latina women affected by poverty, adverse SDOH such as homelessness, or other factors outside of their control (if it makes any difference I am a dark-skinned Latino male and almost all the providers I heard saying these things were white)\n\nEDIT: If you have had these experiences or similar disturbing comments, please share if you feel comfortable doing so",

I know you can have transient hyperthyroidism before hypo, but I couldn't ask about the documentation for that. I also referrer for everything. Even though the np does most of the work, it gets billed under the MD, to charge more. The np works hard and is very nice, but you know.

Then more and more people starting talking about Sketchy with me that I gave it a try when we started viruses. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think I still prefer the Pixorize videos?\n\nWhat are the specific reasons why most students prefer Sketchy for Micro? I did some searching before posting and the consensus is always that Sketchy is more helpful but the reasons why are unclear to me. Here's how I break it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPixorize\n\nPros: shorter videos, focused on more HY material, images themselves are bigger and easier to visualize (at least for me)\n\nCons: misses some important points, shares information in the video without adding a visual cue, has more videos to watch which evens out the time consumption compared to Sketchy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSketchy \n\nPros: covers more material, combines separate viruses/etc. of the same category into one video for better association, already incorporated into the Anking deck (this is actually a big one for me)\n\nCons: some of the videos are way too long, many visual cues are tiny or hard to associate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it doesn't really matter and one will work for some people better than the other. But soooo many people are die-hard Sketchy users I had to ask the question. Lmk your thoughts. Thanks!",

But it wasn't enough to pull myself out of the hole I buried myself in during first semester. \n\nI'm so upset. I tried so hard, lost sleep, and hair, and thousands of dollars.

Now I'll have to put my life on hold for yet another year. \n\nI don't know how I'm going to tell my family as my relationship with some of them is already somewhat strained.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to explain it to my friends when I'm not in their class next semester.

Either I stay at my home institution (mid tier program) where I have great family support, my mother helps out with childcare on weekdays and my wife is able to work full time. The IM training is great with excellent residents, however the subspecialty fellowship that I’m interested in at my home institution is a shitshow (according to current fellows and residents). My other option would be a top 20-30 program that has an renowned subspecialty program, but it’s half way across the country. I have a great impression of residents/faculty, but only through a virtual format. Would like to hear people’s thoughts, particularly if you have children or considering having children during residency. Should I risk the stability for potentially better opportunities later or settle for a more comfortable residency?\n\nBTW I’ve had extensive conversations with my wife and family regarding this already. We’re leaning in one direction, but I wanted to see other people’s perspectives. Thank you and best of luck to everyone entering the Match!",

The same perfect students in suits and ties at the conference table with me on interview day are now eating cereal in their sweat pants at 8am lectures. We were the “best and the brightest” applicants, yet now they have to send us emails asking us not to have sex in the study rooms or else windows will be installed.

        "text": "I’m a MS4 from a USMD school. I dual applied psych and IM due to my low step 1 and geographic limitations. I was fortunate enough to get great numbers of interviews in both. But now I’m torn between ranking psych or IM first. I’ve ruled out combined med/psych and I’m not interested in psych CL as I rotated thru this service before. \n\nPsychiatry: \nPros: interesting patients, being able to create meaningful patient-physician relationships with longer allotted appointment time. In manic/acute psychotic patients, I can make great impacts and see them get better quickly. Good autonomy, better opportunity to open my own practice, good lifestyle, decent money. \n\nCons: the lack of medicine (especially evidence based medicine) is the biggest con for me. I’m afraid of losing most knowledge learned in med school and will not be a “useful” doctor in emergency situations in/out of the hospital. I think I will miss that adrenaline rush when shit hit the fan in medicine. A lot of diagnostic and treatment uncertainties. The lack of resources for my patients especially in underserved areas. Risks of assault (actually happened during my psych rotation) and stalking both me and my family. Severe mid-level encroachments: I feel like psych is being encroached in all directions by NP/PA, psychologists with prescription privileges, and most recently clinical pharmacists with prescription privileges. Whereas other specialties only have to worry about NP/PA. The last point is silly, but I’m a first gen doctor, and my family is disappointed that I’m not a “real” doctor for choosing psychiatry. \n\nIM: \nPros: I like inpatient settings. Get to practice EBM and continue adding more medicine knowledge to my toolbox. I enjoy learning about the pathophysiology of different diseases. Opportunities for procedures and leadership (I may aim for pulm/cc fellowship if I go into IM.) Decent pay and lifestyle after residency. Safer. Get to be the doctor my family wanted me to be. Not a pro, but I don't mind rounding and doing documentations.\n\nCons: the lack of autonomy and as a hospitalist, i will have to stay with the broken US hospital system that cares more about their bottom line than patients. Can be morbid, I experienced multiple patient deaths during IM/ICU rotations and it broke me every time. Lifestyle can be tough during residency and fellowship. I may not make it to pulm/CC due to my low step 1, which is ok because I can see myself as a hospitalist. Midlevel encroachment but less severe than psych. \n\nThanks for reading this long post and i appreciate any advices from current med students, residents, and attendings.\n\np/s: sorry for typos and grammars.",

I recently failed an exam and asked the class representative for his notes since there will be a retest during the summer. Initially, the class rep said he would send me his notes over the weekend, but he never did. \nI followed up with him in person a few weeks later, and he showed me his notes, highlighting how great they were. I thanked him and asked if he would send them to me, and he replied \"Sure, I will! No problem!\" I also made sure to tell him that if he wasn't comfortable sending me the notes, it was okay to say so, but he assured me that there was no issue.\n\nUnfortunately, I still haven't received the notes. I thought the class rep might have been too busy and simply forgot, so I sent a follow-up message, but he didn't respond. I know he saw my message since he is active in our messenger group.\n\nSomeone I'm close to then told me that the class rep made fun of my situation, which I found insensitive. I'm not expecting him to send me his notes at this point, but it's frustrating that he didn't simply tell me if he wasn't comfortable sharing them instead of leading me on.\n\nSomeone has a similar situation or can relate to it?",

I am interested in orthopedics for now, but I am not a 100% sure and would be open to other surgical fields. \n\npros/cons of the ortho one:\n\n\\- networking with the ortho faculty\n\n\\- getting my foot in the door in this competitive ass field, as even getting ortho research seems pretty hard\n\n\\- cons is that it's only 4 weeks and I'm not sure if that would be long enough to have a significant outcome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npros/cons of the bariatric one:\n\n\\- the PI is known to be an extremely supportive mentor who follows up with you long-term and has explicitly ensured an abstract or pub by the end. \n\n\\- cons would be that if I take this, Idk if I would short myself of getting more ortho research opportunities in the future.",

        "text": "What's up everyone - Lost 3rd year student here. Came into med school only wanting to pursue ortho but have become interested in anesthesia since rotating with them. Some thoughts I have had regarding this decision are the following: \n\n\\-I am unsure if I want to lose all of the medicine I have learned in medical school these past few years, I honestly have enjoyed medicine more than I expected to this year. I do not enjoy the length of time it takes to make patients better and all of the grunt work behind the scenes though. Making immediate change for patients, being in the OR still, and still having the opportunity to work with my hands are all things that have made my interest in anesthesia increase.\n\n\\-Things that are making me shy away from orthopaedics: I feel semi-competitive but am no all-star for ortho (and will not have my STEP2 score till late July) and have absolutely 0 idea how match will go without objective stats to rate myself on at this time. I no longer feel that it is the only thing I can do to be happy in medicine anymore and I always hear that you have to be 100% into ortho to be happy with the workload during residency. \n\nLooking for advice from anyone who came to a similar fork in the road near the end of their third year. I do not want to dual apply and let the match decide my specialty for me, I want this to be my decision.  Are there any things I should consider with my decision? Questions I need to ask myself? \n\nThank you all in advance!",
