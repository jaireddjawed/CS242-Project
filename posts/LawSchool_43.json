I am worried that the offer pays less than expected (though it‚Äôs enough). I get the sense they are not going to be willing to budge on the salary. \n\nThis offer is contingent on passing the bar and they are paying nothing up front. How serious is accepting this offer? Should/would I be able to interview with other firms or accept other offers after the accepting this offer? What are the risks associated with doing so? It‚Äôs an easy decision if I‚Äôm not completely locked in, but it‚Äôs much harder if I will be. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

This is what I did to apply successfully when I was a 1L.\n\nFirst, go to NALP and look up a firm you are interested in. Open up \"Lawyer Demographics\" section for a breakdown of the factors and numbers. If you see your group here, then there is a good chance that the firm will consider it a diversity factor. But, to see which group they may be interested in bolstering, see which groups have the fewest number. You may be part of a generally \"overrepresented\" group, but *specifically* in that firm or office, your group may actually be underrepresented. And vice versa.\n\nThen, go to \"Diversity and Inclusion\" section to see what Affinity Groups or special programs the firm may have. These usually are good indicators for what the firm may be looking for in diverse candidates.",

        "text": "Don't really have any real savings, but I've been managing between part time work and some prior work pre law school to be paying through 1L without tapping into any loans. But I may well have to do so sooner than later, and I purposely chose a near full ride at a T50 over lower scholarships at higher ranked school to minimize my debt because I don't want to commit to Big Law (don't necessarily want to do PI either per se, but want the option to go got a more moderately paying job without the stress of BL grades and work hours). \n\nSo like, assuming I'm not gonna be making anything close to bank upon graduation, what would be a good net debt to have? Kinda often stressing tf out about not having any reservoirs but I guess even coming out with a bit of debt is good compared to drowning in it like many others? Just not sure what to prioritize because I moved back home upon starting school to be able to afford paying through law school with no debt (my school is local), but it's really not good for my mental health and I'm figuring it wouldn't be too bad to take out loans that will, between my large scholarship and being locally based, still be less than most.  (For context, because I go to school in the city I live in and my family is minority immigrant demographic where living at home before marriage is common, it's not like I'm a communal oddity but it's def been relatively stifling compared to living on my own beforehand when I was working but I'm so debt adverse I find it hard to justify taking out thousands upon thousands in loans absent absolute pragmatic need, but I feel for my long term well-being small debt is more worthwhile than no debt but dealing with the stress of not moving out.)\n\nWhich I guess is the reason for this question, because maybe some people are gonna be like \"shit you already almost have a full ride? Even if you don't go Big Laws, having less than $50k debt is great\" and that would make me feel great, but who knows. I really never dug deep into this issue because living in a big city and going to a local public college, I've managed to very affordably get through schooling until now without loans being a factor though I know it's the bread and butter of post-high school life for large swaths of America.",

        "text": "So, I will go ahead and admit this post is a product of frustration. However, I can‚Äôt help but feel that the frustration is more than justified and I‚Äôm curious as to what the general opinion is on the subject. \n\nI‚Äôm approaching the end of my time in law school. During my time and as can be expected, I‚Äôve been informed (whether willingly or not) of the class rankings of various different individuals. The individuals typically being discussed or discussing are great students, and they‚Äôre usually ranked much higher than I am. My genuine response when I hear the information is something along the lines of ‚Äúmakes sense, they‚Äôre pretty smart and they work really hard.‚Äù I‚Äôve never felt an ounce of frustration, jealousy, injustice, anything. \n\nThat is no longer the case. And the best word to describe the way I feel is aggrieved. I feel this way after learning how many students at the top of the class rankings have accommodations, what those accommodations entail, and how easy they are to get. Now, I know many people truly need accommodations and the provided accommodations are appropriate in terms of creating a level playing field rather than an unfair advantage. I don‚Äôt mean to attack or criticize those people. What I am upset over is the seeming prevalencey of purely/simply gaming the system. \n\nThis was inspired by a closed-computer but open-book exam. The main obstacle for most of the class was physically navigating our outlines or material. To think that such a substantial amount of people, without need, get twice as long and then we are all ranked without this being taken into account is just infuriating. And those rankings and grades will play a deciding factor in our opportunities, incomes, wellbeing, etc. Not a single student without accommodations finished before time was up. Not a single student with accommodations needed all their time. I either saw or overheard this with my own ears. I also overheard with my own ears how easy accommodations were to obtain. I know firsthand how easy an ADD/ADHD diagnosis would be to obtain from a doctor because I‚Äôm diagnosed myself. I never thought to apply for accommodations because people usually (myself included) finish exams early and I didn‚Äôt think it entailed DOUBLE time. Therefore I didn‚Äôt think it was necessary or that advantageous. Also, for ADD/ADHD, doesn‚Äôt it seem counterintuitive that an accomodated individual can get both adderall/similar to alleviate the symptoms and ‚Äúlevel the playing field‚Äù (or simply use as a PED) AND more time to ‚Äúlevel the playing field‚Äù? It‚Äôs like solving the problem twice.\n\nAm I a sore loser or maybe over exxageratting?  Perhaps I‚Äôm misdirecting anger at accommodations instead of a poorly structured exam (in terms of ensuring that the main thing being tested would be a students understanding of the law rather than the speed with which they can cite it) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or, do other people also feel accommodation abuse is way too prevalent and unjust? I‚Äôm sure it goes without saying given that is Reddit but please be honest and if you think this is more of a ‚Äúme‚Äù issue don‚Äôt hold back in explaining.",

I got a B+ in Contracts, which I am ambivalent about. The doozy is the C I got in Torts. \n\nApologies for the overshare, but I need to vent and this context is critical to understanding why I am so upset. The second week of school this semester my father passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He had pursued a master's degree when I was a toddler, but couldn't swing it (working, being a dad, and a demanding academic schedule made it impossible for him to finish). This was always something that I considered in my life planning and passion about becoming a lawyer -- I wanted to make my dad proud. When I got the news that my dad passed, I immediately knew he would be devastated if I stopped school, so I didn't miss a single class. I worked tirelessly to keep up on readings and outlining every week. After my dad passed away, his house was burglarized (they stole everything, even the TV off his wall and the shoes in his closet, as well as his car). I have never been emotionally stretched so thin -- speaking on the phone to police officers and arranging with my sister to work with a fiduciary all while going to all of my classes. \n\nI worked so hard because I wanted to do something great, and as pathetic as this sounds, I am pretty disappointed in that C. My Torts exam was 4 essays, no multiple choice, and I left feeling like I did well when I left the test. The girls in my study group far out performed me (one got an A, the other a B). \n\nI suppose this post is my version of telling my dad I'm sorry I couldn't rank higher or \"do it for him...\" Law school was my way of living in my dad's legacy, and I feel like I marred it already. \n\nTLDR: Received a C Torts and now feel like I failed my father who passed away three months ago.",

I know opportunities would be better at the higher-ranked school, but then again I would most likely graduate higher ranked in my class at the lower-ranked one.

And *especially*, the ones that make unnecessarily competitive comments and shade others, the ones who direct a shady tone towards kids who mess up their cold calls. The ones who snicker at peoples answers. Give off ‚Äúwould sabotage others to help themselves in curve‚Äù vibes Etc. \n\nI don‚Äôt consider someone a gunner just because they participate in class. Obviously depends HOW they‚Äôre participating but people who ask questions to clarify things because their confused and just happen to participate a lot I‚Äôll never consider to be a gunner. Maybe if they are attempting to correct the professor or something (bc they think they know the law better than everyone as a 1L‚Ä¶ lol). But it seems based on conversations w others in my class they seem to think that those who participate a lot are the gunners.  \n\nIf anything I feel like the real gunners are the quiet ones who you‚Äôll catch making comments in private or side convos about wanting others to fail and do poorly. \n\nWhat is your prime definition of a gunner?",
