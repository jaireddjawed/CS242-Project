Professor Miller will be holding a press conference as soon his plane lands. \n\n2. Professor Miller is going to hold a press conference as soon his plane lands. \n\n3. Professor Miller holds a press conference as soon as his plane lands. \n\n4. Professor Miller is holding a press conference as soon as his plane Lands. \n\nSo far I would say the first one isn’t acceptable as “will be” implies that it is an immediate decision that haven’t been planned but rather decided in that moment and that wouldn’t be realistic for a press conference.  2 is acceptable and I think 4 as well. 3 seems confusing as it sounds as if she would hold it in the second her plane lands which isn’t realistic either and therefore... unacceptable I guess. \n\nAs English isn’t my first language I’m also confused about the fact that it’s either “as soon his” or “as soon as his”. The first option doesn’t sound acceptable to me but I have heard native speakers talking like that before. \n\nhelp\n",

        "text": "Ever since my Language and Comp. teacher taught us that it’s okay to begin sentences with conjunctions, I’ve been using them creatively in my writings, especially speeches. I find that starting sentences with “and” helps the flow of my ideas, while starting with “but” can create drama or emphasis in spoken word. \n\nI always use conjunctions appropriately when placed in the beginning of a sentence; the sentences are complete. \n\nToday, while we peer reviewed each other’s demonstration speeches. These speeches are quite casual and use conversational voice.  \n\nMy professor told us that we should NEVER use “and,” “but,” or “because” at the beginning of our sentences. I asked, “What if ‘because’ is used correctly? For example, ‘Because of so and so reason, I blah blah blah.” He said that’s okay but it’s not preferred and we should still never use “but” or “and.” \n\nWe only marked up a rough draft where there are no points deducted, so I quietly accepted his preference. \n\nBut when I came home, I did some research to see the general consensus on starting sentences with conjunctions. Every website I visited states that it’s okay, sourcing the Bible and Fowler’s Modern English Usage. I understand why the rule is taught in grade school (so that kids do not use it incorrectly or repetitively) but find it very unreasonable for my professor to affirm this. \n\nI want to bring this up to him (with credible sources and all), but don’t know how, or if I even should. \n\nTell me what you think!

        "text": "When I was in K-12, I was aware of gender-neutral language, but I was taught to use *he or she* or *one* or switch to plural form. When I was in college, I took an English class (2009) that all university graduates must take as part of the general curriculum. The professor told us to use singular he or singular she or use *one* or make everything plural. On the Internet, singular he is by far the most common, in my experience. I don’t usually reveal my gender on the Web, but I find that people tend to refer to me or an unknown hypothetical person as “he”. These people may also report high education backgrounds too, in science or mathematics, so I don’t think they are assuming the other unknown person is male or trying to be sexist. It’s probably a deeply ingrained habit to refer to anyone of unknown gender as “he”. \n\nYet, I hear reports quite recently that this usage is actually sexist, and that some women feel excluded by this term. This is so weird. I mean, my English professor said you can pick either singular he or she. And generic he seems to be widely used, regardless of education level. \n\nI’m guessing that the generic he is the status quo, and opponents are challenging this status quo. My question is, how many people are opposing this usage? Or is this opposition mostly done by a vocal minority? Strangely, these terms are not challenged. Lion (masculine), lioness (feminine). Lions are a group of lions and may include females. Doctor (masculine), doctoress (feminine, archaic). Doctors may include male and female doctors. Actor (masculine), actress (feminine). The plural uses the masculine form and may refer to male and female actors. If *actor* can be used gender-neutrally while simultaneously being a masculine form, then why is the generic he viewed as exclusively masculine? ",

It's a video game, and someone is trying to express that the character themselves *feels good to play as.*  Of course saying something entirely different like 'Ivysaur feels very solid' or 'Ivysaur is a very good character' would make more sense, clearly using well as an adverb and good as a noun. \n\nBut do you think the sentence 'Ivysaur did feel quite well' would make sense, even in this context? I'm thinking well/good in this case would have to be modifying 'feel', and as thus, would have to be 'well' since it's the only one of the two that functions as an adverb instead of an adjective. ",
