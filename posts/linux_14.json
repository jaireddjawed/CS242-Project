I was forced to work on Windows for a while and came in to contact with PowerShell. Obviously, PowerShell is inspired from Linux shells but I believe they actually improved the experience by passing objects in pipelines. \n\nPowerShell is of course Open Source as well. I think nu nushell is inspired by PowerShell as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and opinions about PowerShell on Linux? From a technical perspective.",

I know people hate the abuse it's done, but you have to remember not to go too far in the other direction. Look at gnome, they created and analytics app but you have to separately install it. That means that unless you know it exists, you're not going to use it, and that means any data it gathers is going to be absolutely useless. Then we have KDE, where an upcoming version will have a welcome app that gives you the option to opt into it and adjust how much you give as standard first user interaction. THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER! This sort of data can be a huge boon to developers and it's sad that we don't trust telemetry even for open source projects that we can see and verify what they're doing with our data. I encourage all software developers reading this to consider implementing it in an ethical way, so that as soon as you update the program or launch it for the first time you can opt-in to it.",

Their WDs, so ya they're a little clicky out of the box vs others, but not like this. Trying to narrow down what the machine is actually doing when they sound like that if possible.

        "text": "I fought hard for a solution to this one and felt it needed to be shared.\n\nI'm using a TPLink Archer 1200 router, with a USB2 attached NAS. Its an old 1TB rusty HDD in a hard-case and its used to store all sorts of useful things for the entire network (laptops, kids games, TV, movies, etc).\n\nRecently there was a change in the way that CIFS Ver 1.0 was supported in the Kernel.  i.e. it isn't.\n\n(see [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?bug\\_status=\\_\\_open\\_\\_&amp;component=CIFS&amp;order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug\\_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned\\_to%2Cbug\\_id&amp;product=File%20System&amp;query\\_format=advanced](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&amp;component=CIFS&amp;order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&amp;product=File%20System&amp;query_format=advanced)  and [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\\_bug.cgi?id=215375](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215375)  .... it has been brought to Linus' attention twice, but I suspect the dude isn't going to fix what is fundamentally a decrepit protocol)\n\nSo, any previous mounts that worked, no longer work. The will break while doing transfers to/from and no matter what is done you'll receive the dreaded errors. Some files will work, others will fail. Its arbitrary.\n\nWhen the device is `mount`ed with `fstab`, the problems are endless, frustrating and near impossible for a novice to find and/or fix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is only for CIFS SAMBA Ver 1.0**\n\nYeah, yeah, everyone says its insecure etc, but its what my router has, and its STILL sold by TPLink.\n\nWithout spending money, I went looking for a solution and found it in the form of `gio`\n\n**It works. Well. Very well.**\n\nIt it the underlying protocol that NEMO and Deja-Vue Backup uses. gio does not use the kernel to do its thing... ergo, no errors.\n\nNow, use the bits below to put them into a file, `chmod +x &lt;name&gt;` it and run it automatically at login.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`\\#!/bin/bash`\n\n`echo -e \"admin\\\\nWORKGROUP\\\\nadmin\\\\n\" | gio mount smb://192.168.1.1/sda1` \n\n`ln -si $XDG\\_RUNTIME\\_DIR/gvfs/smb-share:server=[192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1),share=sda1/ \\~/NAS`\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChange the bits so it works for you. The username and password are hardcoded. If I were worried about security I wouldn't be using V1.0 of SAMBA!  One needs to change the destination and initial directory, plus the mount point to suit their preferences.\n\nI prefer the `&lt;HOME&gt;/NAS` mount point as one can use NEMO very easily like this. It also makes it easy for the terminal.  Obviously, change that to suit your needs.\n\nI hope this post finds someone, someday and they are relieved of their pain :)\n\nEnjoy!",

I have been using Mac OS X for some years in most of my day for work, and so far, I have liked the experience and simplicity the OS brings (e.g.: I don’t have to spend time on small app configurations unless I want to).\n\nI’m someone who also likes to use my personal laptop to learn and try new tech stuff and I’m currently in the process of buying a new laptop and considering Linux or Mac OS X (my current personal laptop is Windows, but I’m trying to avoid it since I feel that Unix systems can be more performant for tech tasks and I hate lots of stuff on Windows, a simple example is the way they force updates and you can avoid them, etc.).\n\nThus, my questions were to understand if in your use case (Linux vs Mac):\n\n* Do you feel you would get any performance boost, by not having to deal with a lot of hassles when configuring an application or tools, that you might need?\n* Do you think installing tools in Linux is more difficult than on Mac (if the tool does not exist on the package manager)? (Or there are others apps/tools on Linux, besides the package managers, that allow you to install applications, as easily as on Mac systems and I’m not aware of them?).\n* Do you feel that Mac OS X could be an advantage here?\n* Would you be willing to pay more for a machine if it could simplify your day-to-day tasks, even in a personal use case?\n\nThanks for reading it and for any given suggestions.",

Currently I am running Pop OS on my laptop and I have a USB stick with Ventoy that has multiple ISO's copied on to them.\n\nI am able to figure out how to boot the OS's from the USB stick directly but I wanted to know if it is possible to copy one of the OS's to the main drive on my laptop. \n\nBasically, I want to install Mint Cinnamon on my laptop, can I use the ventoy usb to do so? When I tried to do it at first the main drive wasn't showing up as an install option and I didn't want to wipe my USB.",

Is it not so user friendly like OS X or Win? Is it just because lack of software (which will be fixed if linux gets more market share :D) ? Or any other reasons? maybe you can specify why you dont like about it?",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video wmw3fiqklsha1...*\n\n[Github](https://github.com/justjokiing/kshift/tree/main)\n\nkshift is a KDE dark/light shift bash script that activates at sunrise and  sunset when installed. When run manually, it sets the color theme and/or  wallpaper to the 'correct' value based on current time and set theme/wallpaper variables. It uses `plasma-apply-colorscheme` for color themes and `plasma-apply-wallpaperimage` for wallpapers.\n\nDuring installation, kshift sets systemd timers to run the script at sunrise and sunset. If installed and `update_timer` variable is not changed, the timer will update when sunset and sunrise times are updated from the internet.\n\nThis is light-weight alternative to [Koi](https://github.com/baduhai/Koi) and [Ying-Yang](https://github.com/oskarsh/Yin-Yang). The main difference is in its simplicity and customization of a bash script. It includes a home directory variable file when installed, which can add functionality but also just holds values such as the sunrise delay. Installation is simple and no downloads are needed other than the script.\n\nMy Github goes into more depth about installation and use.\n\nLet me know if you guys enjoy it or have any suggestions.",
