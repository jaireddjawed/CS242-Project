This has always perplexed me because matter can never be created or destroyed. And these particles do that all the time.\n\nAnd then another thought came to mind, string theory states that there are multiple dimensions, 10 iirc. And and I kept thinking what particles moving around in higher dimensions would look like to us, and I thought about it and when you move up a dimension you basically pull the plane in a new direction, just not in diagonally. An unidentifiable new direction. Like take a 1 dimensional line, and pull it in a new direction you get a 2d plane, repeat and you have a 3d plane, and so on. So in a way 2d to 3d is equivalent to 3d to 4d and so one, in the sense that you would experience similar effects of a higher dimensional object passing through a lower one.\n\nSo take a 3d particle passing through a 2d plane would look as if it appeared and disappeared instantaneously, and this would be true for 3d and 4d, 4d and 5d, etc...\n\n\nMy point being these virtual particles might be higher dimensional particles passing through our plane of existence, so to speak. Could we measure them? I know we know of the particles due to the casmir effect. I think if we figured out how to track the we could start peering into higher dimensions, like Galileo peered into the universe. I've always wondered. \n\nEdit:due to a few beautiful explanations this is undoubtedly wrong. \n",

Simple high school science experiment for example.\n\nNow the black hole, from my experience, has always been drawn and described in scifi as being a hole in space, a hole in the cotton sheet that you can fall through.  But my understanding has always been that the singularity at the center of the black hole is an object of essentially infinite? ? ? mass, so is no different than any other object floating in space, just infinitely more massive.  Is this correct or is a black hole really a hole in space that could possibly lead elsewhere?",

Several days, or several hours?\n\nI'm writing a hard-science fiction story where this scenario happens, and I want to know how long it would take. I would be able to calculate it, I suppose, but I don't know how fast radioactive fallout travels on the wind: I assume since it would have so much soot it would be very dense and therefore harder for the wind to move. I used NUKEMAP for the wind direction and speed, but I don't see if it calculates how long it would take for the fallout to spread from ground zero to the gulf.\n\nI was originally going to calculate it based on how long it takes for storm systems to travel, but then I remembered that the soot and radioactive debris would be in the atmosphere, and I figured that would be so dense it would slow down the migration on the wind",

He will also be using those same samples in a side experiment regarding growth rates of bean plants, with respect to the type of water sample used.  My thought is that the chemical composition of those samples, specifically any added minerals, will affect the freezing and/or melting rates.  Is this correct?  If so, I want to make sure he has some testing equipment available so he can make any observations on his own, but I don't know what to get.  The pool test strips seem inappropriate as I don't believe the acidity levels alone would make that much of a difference...although I could be very wrong about that.\n\nI appreciate any/all comments, advice, and/or corrections to my understanding.

        "text": "I have an idea I'd like to develop for putting a solar farm in space. My thinking goes that the Earth's atmosphere deflects a lot of sunlight, so by being in space, we can avoid losing that energy. There is also a lot of space in space while space is very limited on Earth, so putting massively huge solar panels that could collect tons of energy theoretically could potentially provide enough energy for the entire planet many times over. Is my thinking correct in how beneficial putting a solar farm in space would be? What are your recommendations for how to best implement an idea like this? Any information would be greatly appreciate. Thank you.",
