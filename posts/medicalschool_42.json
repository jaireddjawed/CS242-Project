        "text": "My partner and I are planning to couples match, and we were a bit confused about the algorithm/ranking process -- just wondering if anyone can help clarify! \n\nFor context we are both applying to fairly noncompetitive specialty and interviewed at \\~20 programs each. Many are in the same city although we agreed early in the process that we are okay separating for the next 3 years for our top choice programs.\n\nMy question is this -- if we rank our top choices:\n\nStudent A        Student B\n\n1) program 1 - program 1\n\n2) Program 1 - program 2\n\n3) Program 1 - program 3\n\n4) Program 1 - program 4\n\n... (and so on w/ all of student B's rank list)\n\n20) program 2 - program 1\n\n21) program 3 - program 1\n\n22) program 4 - program 1\n\n... (and so on w/ all of student A's rank list)\n\n40) program 3-program 4, etc. (other combos)\n\nWould this effectively maximize each of our chances of matching at Program 1 and Program 2? (we don't mind separating if we can go to program 1 or 2). Does the order we rank the program 1 set and program 2 set matter (i.e. does it matter if the first 20 ranks are student A's program 1 x student B's 1, 2, 3 vs student B's program 1 x student B's 1, 2, 3)?\n\nI was told some conflicting things but based on my understanding of the algorithm I don't really understand how this would hurt the chance of either of us at our top choice. If student A doesn't match at program 1, then the first 20 ranks aren't really relevant. If student A does match at program 1, then it goes down student B's rank list. Someone told me that if student A gets program 1, then student B could end up getting a lower rank on their individual list (combo #4 for example) and missed out on their number one choice (program 1 for B). I don't really understand that line of reasoning as I would assume that if student A got program 1 then student B would get their program 1 if they were ranked high enough as well. Can anyone shed light on this? Thank you!",

        "text": "I am having some trouble choosing a specialty, and I really can not decide on what to do! I am currently between Urology and a pediatric subspecilaty. On one hand I really like the OR (its probably my favorite part of medicine) and I like the day to day. It is engaging and I like and variety that you get from a surgical specialty. It does not bother me when I am in a 12 hour long case and I have generally enjoyed the people I have rotated with. However, this pediatric subspecialty brings me a lot of fulfilment that I just do not get from uro. I really like kids and helping them through hard times and it leaves me feeling like I have really made a difference when I get home at the end of a long day. I really do not get this same feeling when I am in uro. Plus I enjoy research and I find the subject material to be more interesting than Uro. However, the day to day is significantly less apealing to me. I really like talking with families and kids, but titrating medications and writing long notes or having long rounds is so much less apealing. I really do not know what to do! I am more concerned for the match for urology, but I believe I would be competitive enough to match. However, maybe not at the institution of my choice, so having to move away from my SO and family would be possibility. (again a negative that would not be an issue in peds) Also the pay gap is significant, which is a concern.  I feel like the both offer me great things, but either way I have to give up something important.",

I had studied my ass off for this exam and pulled an all nighter but I decided to take a nap at 4 am and then wake up at 6 so I can go to uni bc the exam was on 8:30.\n\nSo my dumbass falls asleep tired af. I wake up at 6 but the little demon fella on my shoulder told me \"sleep ten minutes more\" and I listened to it. So I go back to sleep and then wake up abruptly at 8:23 with my heart almost stopping at the realization that the eexamis literally starting n 7 minutes and I was light years ahead from uni. So I quickly panic and text my friends screaming and then I realize that maybe I can take the exam with the next group of students (we were divided into two groups and I was at the first group).\n\n I'm usually really optimistic so I didn't think it was all over and I could actually make it over there on time and maybe the professors could let me take the exam with the second group. \n\nSo I ran out of my house with no breakfast, no vitamins, no water, wearing only my black circles and the first clothes I could find. I quickly go to my bus stop and then I see that the bus comes in 2 minutes so I thought that I was lucky and I could make it on time. \n\nAnd the universe laughed bc the universe knew. The bus comes and I get into it. But guess what. If you thought I was unlucky so far you are going to be shocked. I GOT INTO THE WRONG BUS AND DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL TOO LATE. \n\nI quickly get out of the bus and then open Google Maps. I was like 38 minutes away from uni if I went there by walking. But hope dies last so I still thought I could make it if I went fast lmaooo. So I began walking as fast as I could. \n\nI finally reach uni and I storm inside the building but the exam had already started. So I finally gave up and went home and mourned all the hours I studied for this exam. I was prepared so well and I was ready to ace it but it's like the universe didn't want me to take it today lmao. \n\nIf you read so far lmao I hope you enjoyed my suffering. Also sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language. Anyway I'm going to cry and study for my next exam now and I will put 103837 more wake up alarms for it. \n\nHope you have a great day/night bc I surely didn't have.",

        "text": "I’ve tried to find somewhere to ask this question, my Dr doesn’t seem to take me seriously…so I’ve resorted to this platform.\n\nIn 2019, I was the home plate umpire for a college baseball game. During the game I got hit with a 90+ mph foul ball to my mask. As an umpire I’ve been hit many times, additionally, I played college football and got retired early because of a series of concussions.\n\nAnyway, umpire masks are curved on purpose to help deflect these kinds of blows. The unique thing that happened, was that round foul ball at roughly 94-95 mph, hit me square, bent my titanium mask rails flat, and the ball landed at my feet. This indicated my head absorbed the entire inertia of that ball.\n\nI knew immediately something was wrong, but I tried to be tough, and I went 6 more outs, at which point, I felt so much pressure in my head, they stopped the game because I was stumbling and staggering as if I was drunk.\n\nA few weeks later, I started tripping, very slightly, then it degenerated to complete stumbling.\n\n3.5 years later, I’ve had two MRI’s, which indicated everything is fine, and two neurology doctors examine me. \n\nI continue to have this balance issue, and the only person to put forth a diagnosis was a physical therapist, and she said it was an inner ear (vestibular) issue, because when I close my eyes, I stumble and have even fallen while in the shower. \n\nThis is causing immense depression , and as a former athlete, and only 45 years old, I’m at my wits end. If I do have a drink of alcohol, the condition worsens, but that is not the cause. I’m at the mercy of VA doctors, and no disrespect to them, I just feel I’m not getting the care needed to remedy this condition.\n\nOn the human/emotional side, this debilitating condition has humbled me in a way I can’t even explain. I’m a law student, in my third year, and I stumbled in court this week while arguing for a client. I was so embarrassed I had to have my supervising attorney take over that easy case.\n\nI’m posting this here because I think there’s a wealth of knowledge on here, but I would like to respectfully request that y’all only respond if said response will truly be helpful. I don’t want to see negative comments, and I’m simply asking if anyone  in the medical profession might be able to guide me to becoming whole again. Thank you, and I apologize for the lengthy post.",

        "text": "Hey all, this is part 1 of a guide to medical school. I’m writing this as a fourth-year currently applying for residency in a competitive surgical subspecialty. I got 250+ on both boards, got 20+ research pubs in a year without prior experience,  finished away rotations, and completed interviews (don't mean to brag, just think its good to know generally how someone did when you're reading their advice). \n\nNow, I finally have some free time, and time to reflect on everything that I’ve gone through.\n\nI wrote this because there are many things I regret doing in medical school. I sorely wish I had someone who warned me ahead of time. Woulda saved a lot of time, energy, emotional wellbeing. \n\nThis guide is basically composed of the things I wish I knew, and is written for first, second, and third years. \n\nI'm hoping to help at least one of you, since posts from random strangers on this subreddit helped me a ton throughout this journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 1: Set your mind right \n\nThe first thing you have to do in medical school as soon as possible, is to set your mind right. \n\nHere is what you’re walking into: you are walking into a system that has ever-increasing tuition with the medical education system that is not incentivized to provide you the best education nor mentorship, but is incentivized to keep the status quo.\n\nThis is an unfortunate reality. Med school can still be worth it, and it will be overall better if you accept this sooner. \n\nWhether you want to save the world, be an amazing physician, make a bunch of money, have a great lifestyle, medical school is not here to help you do any of that (no matter how much they tell you that)\n\nMed school administration will tell you that they have your best interests in mind, but they are all older to middle-aged individuals with their own families and depend on their jobs in order to keep food on the table. They will do whatever it takes to keep their job and protect their lifestyles. \n\nThe healthcare system will say it values doctors and healthcare heroes. But nobody has done anything to address the significant financial, health, and relationship costs for those who take this path. The absurd costs of medical school, the weddings missed, the 24+ hour call shifts that ruin your physical health, the below minimum wage hourly pay for PGY6 neurosurgery residents.\n\nEven classmates....they will start telling you they know what's best for you. But do they really? Have they proved themselves or are they just struggling in the same system you are with imperfect information?\n\nThis is not unique to medicine. This is how the world works. \n\n**YOU alone are responsible for getting what YOU want out of medical school.** \n\nSo, what do you need to do?\n\n**You need to understand why you are in medical school.** \n\n**You are primarily in medical school to match into your dream job.**\n\nYou are not in medical school to get a good score on boards or get publications. Those are all tools to obtain the main goal. \n\nMed school admin will tell you to do well on class grades and everything will be fine! \n\nWhat you don't know is that they are incentivized to keep their professors employed and have a high overall match rate (some schools are literally incentivized by the government to get more students into primary care, chew on that). \n\nSociety is going to tell you not to care about money when picking a specialty. Fuck that lets first figure out why our tuition is so high, residency salary is so low, and legal/administrative bullshit is so common.  \n\nClassmates are going to tell you that all that matters is getting high board scores and publication counts. That is productive at least, but you should definitely avoid hyperfixating on these things like many students do.\n\nMost people in their fourth year and beyond know people who have gotten 99 percentile on their boards, or numerous publications, or had AOA student leadership positions and did not match into their desired residency program. \n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n**This means you need to take all advice with a grain of salt (including this post). Never follow anyone blindly. And always ALWAYS remember your ultimately goal of finding your dream job and life.** \n\nWhich means asking yourself the question, what does it actually take to get into a dream residency program? \n\nI'll say that again: \n\n**What does it actually take to get into a dream residency program?**\n\nThis is the one question I wish I really thought deeply about when I started medical school. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no strict guidelines as far as what determines whether someone is a rockstar applicant or not. \n\nAnd there are many cases of people with very low board scores and no publications getting into top dermatology, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery residency positions. \n\nHow does this happen?\n\nThis happens because after you hit minimum cutoff scores, the residency application process is not a numbers game. \n\n**It is at the end of the day a PEOPLE game.** \n\nThe residency application process is like any other job search process. It is both a combination of your raw stats, with your relationships. \n\nUltimately when it comes to selecting a resident, this residency program of yours will get a bunch of their faculty and senior residents into a room. \n\nThen they’re going to put your picture up on a projector and then talk about you like you are rushing for a fraternity or sorority (whether in person or virtually)\n\nThen they're going to rank all of the applicants in a list. \n\nIf someone in that program, the person in the program with the most pull or influence (such as the chair or PD) decides that they really want a candidate despite their low stats they are probably going to get that candidate. \n\nIf anyone and I mean anyone labels you as an asshole, unavailable, lazy, or incompetent, that will probably be a huge red flag and get you eliminated from contention. \n\nI hear a lot of students bemoaning this reality once they get to the stage. And it’s really unfortunate because a lot of students in their first year are led to believe that getting a high board score or getting a bunch of publications is a golden ticket to getting into a program. \n\nBut honestly, nontraditional career changers will know this, this is just how the world works. \n\nHiring someone for a job is like committing to a long-term relationship. Would you really date someone for five years if they had some huge red flags? If your best friend vouched for a guy/girl, would you be more likely to date them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, just to recap. Again, you are in medical school to find your dream job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd ultimately, you get that dream job by: \n\n**1) Having good enough board scores and grades to not get filtered out**\n\n**2) Having somebody in the room vouch for you enough to rank you**\n\n**3) Not being lazy, an asshole, or doing anything to eliminate yourself from the conversation**\n\n**4) Doing 1-3 at enough programs to get enough interviews to optimize your probability of matching**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, all your time/energy/actions should be pointed toward the above four points. \n\nHard work alone is not enough.\n\nIn future posts I will talk about points 1-4 and will write guides to boards, getting publications, and how to get someone in the room to vouch for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask ANY question you might be curious about. I have a bunch of time these next few weeks, so I'm happy to help anyone who may need it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you happen to be someone preparing for Step/COMLEX 1/2 but are at the bottom of your class / fear failing, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'd like to help. I've coached a few people in those situations already to passing scores.",

I barely passed my EM shelf and I feel like I am doing literally everything that I am supposed to be doing to do to succeed. For this shelf, I did ALL of UWorld and all of the incorrects. On top of that, I did at least like 300+ EM questions from Amboss and like 200 anki reviews every day. I started studying from the very first day and literally studied during any downtime during my shift and like at least an hour or two every day in the evening. I did the two NBMEs on the week prior to the exam and did poorly on those but I also rushed through those. On exam day I took my time, read every question, and did the process of elimination to eliminate answers. I also haven't done IM or surgery so that could be hurting me for this rotation, but I haven't performed as well as I wanted to on previous shelf exams either. And yet I still barely passed. I don't know what's wrong with me. I had a very poor foundation from preclinical due to mental health issues, COVID learning, etc and had a hard time with Step 1 but I feel like I have recuperated a lot of knowledge gaps during my dedicated time. So I am not sure what is bringing me down. Can anyone please help me because I am really worried about my future shelf exams and taking Step 2.",

In addition I will probably also have done 2-3 NBME practice exams. I heard that doing the IM questions is good prep for the Surgery shelf, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to start it. For that final week, should I redo the missed/flagged questions for Surgery or start the IM questions? Or should I do something else (more NBME questions, Anki, OME, etc)?",

        "text": "Just started studying Hematology lately. Getting a little bit confused these days. I have a question about lymphomas. For example It is easy to understand which cells Multiple Myeloma or Waldenström starts in. It is monoclonal gammopathy of a single matured plasma cell. So we have too much unnecessary ımmunoglobulins produced by that exact affected plasma cell lineage. So please correct me If I am wrong, I think from my understanding it is safe to say Plasma Cells Dyscrasias are bone marrow independent. They might infiltrate the bone marrow at the later stages but at the start, the disease is bone marrow independent.\n\nHow should I think Lymphomas? B lymphocytes are produced the in bone marrow and released into lymphatic circulation and T cells comes from Thymus gland. Should I  think it like this? :When the disease starts, some matured cell in lymphatic system goes crazy just like a plasma cell in Multiple Myeloma. So lymphoma is kind of bone marrow independent because bone marrow already done its  part succesfully. Of course later lymphoma can infiltrate the bone marrow and distrupt it.\n\nAm I on the right track here?",

        "text": "  \n\nAsking this question on multiple threads, just trying to get opinions and advice before I set myself on a path. \n\nI’m currently working for the military as an aircraft maintenance officer. I’m thinking of getting out in about 4-5 years. I want to pursue a career in medicine, preferably as an anesthesiologist or working anesthesia, and have my GI Bill pay for medical school/Master’s degree. My bachelor’s degree is completely unrelated to the medical field, so I have several options. \n\n1. I get out and apply for a post-bacc program (Goucher, Bryan Mawr, etc.) and hopefully get accepted, pass, and then apply for medical schools. The obstacle here is I would have to pay for this program out of pocket, as well as living arrangements, etc. \n\n2. I apply for the Mt Sinai U.S. Military Institutional Partnership [ISMMS Institutional Partners Admissions Process | Icahn School of Medicine (mssm.edu)](https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/admissions/application/institutional-partners) some time before I get out. This saves me the trouble of having to take the MCAT and seems to line up very well with me being able to use my GI Bill to pay for my tuition. The issue here is that they require all their prerequisites to be in person classes, which I don’t think I’ll be able to take with my current work schedule but might be able to make it work with night classes. There’s also the risk of the program being canned by the time I get out, plus I’d have to pay these courses out of pocket as well. \n\n3. I get out and apply for a masters in anesthesiology, and work as an AA. I understand these are not available in every state but the states I would want to live in already have these approved. \n\nBottom line, what are your guys’ thoughts? Is medical school worth it? Have any of you applied to these programs and if so, what has been your experience?",

I’m a bit concerned going into third year with the lack of research (I have other ECs, mostly in service and advocacy and led our OBGYN student group). I have also been having a lot of health issues and as a result have been in and out of the hospital over the last month and a half and am concerned about my physical ability to do third year/pass STEP. I’m wondering if I don’t get better in the next month if I should just take a research year and focus on my health before starting third year as I’m concerned I won’t really have time to focus on health until after residency otherwise? Or if I do end up pushing through, will I be okay with this amount of research/is it possible to do research third year?",

        "text": "Scenario: I have a friend. This friend is nearly 30. He has worked many different jobs throughout his 20s, always with the idea that he is pre-med. Slowly taking classes, slowly studying for the MCAT, slowly accumulating clinical experience etc. \n\nThe time has finally come now. This friend is nearly 30 and he has signed up to take the MCAT this spring. I of course have only ever been super encouraging, telling him that he should do what he’s passionate about and he’ll make it work. \n\nThe problem though is I don’t think I really believe that. Starting medical school when you are almost 30 sounds absolutely terrible to me. That means grinding through a gen surg block as an MS3 when you’re 33. That means applying to residencies and having to potentially move across the country at 34-35. If he wants to do a fellowship, he’ll be nearly 40 by the time he’s applying. Not to mention 10 years of living on loans with no meaningful income, being away from family, etc. I just don’t think it’s all worth it at this point, especially with what a shit show the medical industry is right now in the US.\n\nPersonally I would never tell my friend this, because I know he won’t listen. I wouldn’t listen either if I were in his shoes. But it feels shitty to be on the other side of things watching somebody who’s about to throw themselves down this path. \n\nI don’t know, what do you all think? Would you advise someone to start med school at 30? “You’re gonna be 40 either way might as well be 40 and a doctor” and all that",
