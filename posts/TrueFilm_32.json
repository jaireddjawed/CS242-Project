        "text": " I've been a Tarantino fan since I was younger. My first experience with him was with Kill Bill, a movie that was totally unlike anythng I've watched at the time: not in chronological order, extremely violent and with some of the most unusual dialogues I've ever heard. Of course I would notice this pattern of characteristics in all of his other movies as I watched them, but today I'd like to talk about one of them, one that I've looking foward to analyse for quite some time. The Hateful Eight, his 8th movie, one that I've been revisiting every now and then since I watched it 'cause of something I notice during it's progression: Tarantino's patience. I'm not saying that the other movies he made are not patiently wrote and made as well \\(hell...Django and Inglorious Bastards are way over 2 hours long\\) but this one is quite different, and incredible because of that. Apart from some bullet shots and some punches thrown to Daisy's face, there's basically no action for the first half of the movie, just dialogues, that are not only fantastic and help stablishing the characters, but also set the atmosphere of mystery and doubt that would be vital for the upcoming apex. This initial lack of action made me curious, cause typically, Tarantino does not wait that much to show some real bloody scenes (there's Kiddo vs Vernita in volume 1, Landa's Massacre in Inglorious Bastards, Mr. Orange bleeding in Reservoir Dogs, the slave owners getting killed in Django, etc\\). I wondered what he was planning after that relatively calm first half of the movie...and I got very satisfied. The final act is a huge payoff for everyone that payed attention to how the film progressed, not only because of the incredibly violent climax that's presented, but also because it is the apex of the movie's character development.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's character turns into the most diabolical and threatning of the whole movie at this act, and the dinamic between Warren and Chris is amazingly nice to see...maybe even heartwarming. Those two were the perfect antagonists to each other since the beggining of the movie: a black soldier and a racist confederate forced to endure the other's presence, but that end up having to work together to survive/get revenge and eventually earn each other's respect and even create some type of  \"friendship\" at their final moments. As the credits role, I always catch myself thinking about the masterpiece I've just watched, that is not just a great story told, but also a visual documment about the ethnical relations in the USA. As a comment I once red on YouTube once said: \"The final scene has a peculiar way to tell us that we all look the same inside\".",

        "text": "The very short credits end and the lights turn back on. I want to stay for another 10 minutes just to think about it, but I leave just to be sure... I walk outside and I feel out of place, like I stepped out too soon. The silence in my ears feels like the feeling that you get when you land and step out of an airplane. My god, what a powerful movie, and to think that I almost missed the opportunity to watch this in theatres for *Deadpool 2*.\n\nI just want to preface this by saying, has film ever looked better than it did during technicolor? My god is this movie gorgeous, the way that different colors pop out and how the picture resembles painting more than it does real life thanks to being filmed on film rather than digital(which of course wasn’t available back then).\n\nRosemary's Baby is by far the most haunting horror film that I’ve seen, despite having 0 jump scares or little to no violence portrayed. I don't think there are many characters that I can say that I sympathized with to anywhere near the degree of sympathy that I felt for Rosemary throughout the movie. Hell, the ending almost had me in tears because of how sorry and sad I felt for her. It got such a strong reaction out of me that most movies don't come close too, let alone the horror genre from which I haven't watched a movie that got 1/10th the reaction that Rosemary's Baby got from me. \n\nThe frightening thing about Rosemary's situation is that if you don't have her perspective, the people and the situations that happen around her seem completely normal. The scariest thing in the world is a lonely soul screaming for help while everybody goes on about their day and ignore your shout, and the only people that are close to you are either the ones ruining your life or outsiders that would think that you're crazy. \n\nIs there a horror film that focuses on its characters as much or near the amount that this film does? It's one of those movies where even if the whole movie was about the couple and their relationship, you'd still love it, watching them go on about their day... This is why that hours after the movie has ended, I'm still here feeling sad for Rosemary, and sad that we can’t help her, because these aren't just characters, they're people, thanks to the amazing acting done by Mia Farrow(who btw kept reminding me of Gwyneth Paltrow) and her co-star John Cassavetes.\n\nThe film is such a slow burner and ”subtle” that before the last 10 minutes of the film, you weren't even sure if it was going to reveal anything, and either way could have worked perfectly, hell(no pun intended) the alternative ending where we got no answers might have been as, if not more compelling than the one we got, not that this is a complaint about the real ending which was just tragic and sad, a sad nightmare that you can't do anything about. Her husband who you truly thought loved and cared for her, sold her body, and their own son up for some capital gain and sucess, and at that point you can't say that he truly cares for her, you just can't. Leaving her in a big and lonely city that Polanski perfectly captures in the opening and ending credits along with that lullaby, a wonderful and tender tune that I’ve been listening for hours non-stop now and will likely haunt my dreams.\n\n\nRosemary's Baby is one of the best movies that I've seen, and it's certainly one of if not the best theatre experience that I have ever had. My eyes had never looked wider than during those 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I've never felt so hopeless and afraid of a character’s fate like I was here. Even writing this is making the tears surface in my eyes, my god what a powerful film indeed. Kubrick's ”The Shining” might be more technically impressive than ”Rosemary's Baby”, but as far as I'm concerned, it isn't anywhere near as haunting nor are its characters anywhere near as compelling or complete, and this is coming from someone who *REALLY* liked ”The Shining”. One of the most compelling cinema that I've ever seen, and most definitely a masterpiece. This is one of those movies that instantly becomes one of my favorites and I sure hope that I can watch it again in the theatre, hopefully very soon.\n\nEdit: Release date should be 1968 and not 1966.",

        "text": "I've said before that Deadpool 2 is a victim of its own style. The character is a wise-cracking self-referential fourth wall breaker. And the first movie adapted that aspect of the comics very well. So obviously the sequel would do that too. But the sequel actually had some really strong drama and I wish it were a serious movie that would focus on that drama instead of focusing on Yentl jokes. I had some good laughs, I admit that, but for the most part I wished Wade would just shut up and be part of a better movie.\n\nDeadpool suffers a tragic loss and the audience cares because the relationship was very well set up in the first movie and the actors had chemistry. He descends into suicidal despair and he attempts to better himself by doing what he thinks his dead lover would have wanted him to do. Enter a villain that's not really a villain but an equally broken person who suffered an equal terrible loss - he's just dealing with it differently. He's just trying to stop it from ever happening by killing the real villain of the movie while he's still a child (which is also the plot of Looper, but whatever). In the end Cable decides to team up with Deadpool, both characters see each other's point of views, they achieve their goals through personal sacrifices, they learn lessons, and they grow. It's all very interesting and compelling and miles ahead of most of MCU's villain/hero dynamic and drama. If this wasn't a Deadpool movie but, say, Batman, we'd probably have the new Dark Knight on our hands. But Deadpool 2 is a Deadpool movie and so all of that compelling character building drama is riddled with jokes that diminish all of its impact. \n\n",

        "text": "Mass pollution, the rise in sea levels, deforestation, mass shootings, suicide bombings; the destruction of the natural world. The particulars of the world of 2018 are not the same as they were in 1976, the one that gave birth to Travis Bickle, the eponymous loner of the Paul Schrader penned *Taxi Driver*. There was no internet for Bickle to access the exact measures in which we are poisoning the planet or share videos of suicide bombers on social media. The void that consumed Bickle murmured of filth and degeneracy. The void that preaches to Schrader's Reverend Ernst Toller \\(Ethan Hawke, in a career\\-best performance\\) does so of mankind's desecration of nature, and the apathy in which we do so. The void may say different things to each man, praying on their particular prisons of isolation ––Bickle in the nocturnal streets of New York City and his sexual frustration, Toller in his sparsely attended tourist stop of a church and his grief over the loss of his child––but it's the same void. Schrader invokes the specter of *Taxi Driver* \\(even down to using specific visual homages\\) not to recapitulate the glories of his earlier career, but to remind us that as bad as the world may seem right now, as changed as it is, our deepest fears\\-\\-the ones that truly keep us awake at night and steal hope from us\\-\\-may be more pervasive, but they are the same as they've always been.\n\nToller's faith is on shaky ground from the get\\-go in the film, battling illness, alcoholism, and a destroyed family. His doubts are eating away at him from the inside, and he no longer even has the ability to pray \\(in fact, the only time we see him kneeling is when he's throwing up in the toilet\\). But Toller still has hope for humanity... and himself. The catalyst that begins to truly degrade his spirit is in his counsel to Michael, a troubled young man on the cusp of extremism, driven to the brink over the prospect of bringing a child into a world that may ignite in flame in its lifetime. His room is adorned with statistics reflecting the myriad metrics of doom. Even a decade ago his character might seem outlandish, a reflection of real angst perhaps but a caricature, a street corner doomsayer shouting at passers\\-by. Today though? Michael exists in real life. I was instantly reminded of Brian Reed's exceptional podcast *S\\-Town*, which investigated a fascinating true\\-life character who was driven by the exact same existential despair felt by Michael, right down to the encyclopedic rantings on climate statistics. You only need to turn on the news to see the latest example of loneliness and despair driving acts of violence, to themselves or others. You probably know people who have questioned the morality of having kids in such a world.\n\nThere's another thread that connects Toller to Michael beside their shared fixation. Mary\\-\\-Michael's pregnant wife \\(the symbolism is rife here\\) and a confidant of Toller, played by Amanda Seyfried\\-\\-represents the stakes Toller is playing for: the future of humanity itself; if not in the flesh then perhaps in spirit. It's easy to see why Toller is so drawn to Mary, as Seyfried's large eyes shine with a reflective innocence that stand in sharp relief from Toller's own hooded stare, and the cold world they look out upon.\n\nSchrader brings this infectious existential crisis to vivid life with the film's sparse mise\\-en\\-scene, and cramped 4:3 framing. There's hardly any color in the film, and there's almost no non\\-diegetic music employed until over an hour into the film \\(and when it is introduced, it's not melodic, but the droning noise of the abyss and what may or may not lurk within\\). Almost everything in the film is reserved. It's not a film that goes to you but asks you to come to it. It's quiet so you have to listen harder, and it lingers so you're forced to look longer. Even Hawke plays his part very small, never giving away too much. I never got the sense that these techniques were employed to deliberately frustrate the viewer's engagement of the story, only to ask them to meet what is likely to prove a divisive and challenging film half way.\n\nHowever, in two deliberately jarring instances, *First Reformed* breaks from its restraint and repression, delivering full\\-bodied metaphysical spirituality \\(one of them that recalls the works of acclaimed Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky\\) that shatters the rigid constraints Schrader has himself laid out. You will recognize them when you see them, and it's in these brief sequences that contain perhaps the key to the film's message of duality, of hope within the hopelessness. It's not easy, they seem to suggest, and it's impossible to do it alone, but there is a way out.\n\n [https://thefilmera.com/2018/05/28/first\\-reformed/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/05/28/first-reformed/) link with pictures.",

I didn't want to like this film at first because the concept looked like it was just going to be another formulaic feel good film about an underdog who makes good. But I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the movie has a heart that endears it to me. \n\nThe cinematography is so good at capturing the rich old world Mexican sets and costumes. The sleepy Mexican countryside and adobe structures bring such a rich and gentle feel to the film. You get a strong sense of what life in a place like this would be like. \n\nThe performances are amazing as well in the most sarcastic, deadpan way. Jared and Jerusha do not choose pretty, fit actors/models for the movie. They delight in showing humanity in all it's homely, pathetic glory. In all of their ineptitude, you can't help but feel sweet for all the misfits and geeks. The movies cast really has a way of bringing awareness to our societies standards of beauty and what is and is not acceptable in our society. We feel a revulsion toward the awkward, week, overweight people of the film and yet, you see the sweet vulnerable side of each of them. Nacho's malnourished partner in crime evokes a cringe at first sight and yet he grows on you and his dirty, nappy appearance gradually becomes sweet and innocent. The creators intentionally show their characters in their most inept and sad state and then they pull the humanity out of them creating a weird contradiction in us, forcing us to confront our own judgments about people.  \n\nAnd then there is Jack Black. His performance is so alive and brilliant that it makes me wonder how much of Nacho is Jared and Jerusha and how much of Nacho is Jack Black. You can see that he put a lot of effort to get the Spanish accent right, adding subtle but noticeable accents on common words. He really embraced this character, bringing it to life. It's Jack Black in all his manic charm and yet you never question that he grew up in this monastery, and lives this life. I'm pretty sure he was responsible for a lot of the dialog considering that it sounds just like many of his other characters. But the film shows Black in his most inspired and vivacious. It's my favorite Black film. I think it's his masterpiece and the film that I will most remember him for. \n\nI've watched it a couple of times this week and I think I'll watch it again, taking in all the deadpan silliness, the rich Mexican atmosphere, and the touching humility of the characters. It warms my heart toward life with all of it's insanity and subtle charm and beauty. Nacho is an incredible example of what is possible in the art of film. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8mvj13/black_swan_2010_theme_of_repetition/",
        "text": "I just watched this movie and I’ve fallen in love with it. When I looked it up here, I saw a lot of people discussing the themes of sexual maturation and obsession. But I also thought there was a clear theme of repetition that wasn’t really being discussed much, so I thought I might talk about it now. \n\nThomas in the beginning of the film states how they’ve done swan lake multiple times. This is another show like any other. But to make this one better, he wants it to be more “visceral”. I think of all the past leads of swan lake, it’s safe to assume that Nina’s experience was the most visceral. \n\nLily and Nina are obviously supposed to be look alikes. But I think Beth was also meant to resemble them as well, having a similar hair color, frame, and clothing fashion to Lily. \nNina also states how she wanted to be perfect like Beth, stealing some of her possessions and worshipping them by meticulously placing them on her makeup table. \nBeth was Nina’s predecessor, and Nina fears that lily will be her successor. Like Nina, Beth most likely had sexual relations with Thomas. He even referred to her as his “little princess”. At the end of the film, Thomas passes this title down to Nina. \n\nNina’s biggest breakdown comes from when she hallucinates Thomas and Nina having sex, as this I think confirms in her head that Lily has already come to replace her, as Thomas always has sex with the “star ballerina”. \n\nAnother important thing to note is that it’s frequently stated how dancers have to make the best of their fame “while it lasts”. Beth is livid when she’s kicked out just for aging. Nina knows this fame and this role is fleeting, so she’s already suspicious of another dancer (lily) coming in and stealing it away. Just like Beth, Nina doesn’t want to give up that title. \n\nBut I think there’s another person who serves as a “repeat” of Beth, Nina, and Lily: Nina’s mom (Erica). Erica looks a bit like her daughter, the two having similar hair color and hair styles. Noticeably, Erica dresses like a ballet dancer - wearing athletic, flexible clothes that are often dark in color. Though Erica was once a dancer, she gave it up 28 years ago when Nina was born and instead became a painter. Yet she still dresses like a dancer for some reason.  \nNina’s real father is briefly alluded to be artistic director, which is Thomas’s role in the Swan Lake production. So just like Nina and Beth, Erica had a romantic relationship with her art director. \n\nBoth Erica and Nina struggle to stay attached to either their innocent or evil side. For Nina, she wants to get in touch with her “evil” side - which Lily is the personification of. For Erica, I feel she wants to get in touch with her “innocent” side - which Nina is the personification of. \n\nI think this is seen in how Erica treats Nina like an extension of herself. (Erica expects Nina to dance like her and acts like Nina’s successes and failures are her own as well). Erica then forces this extension of herself to be innocent and pure, buying Nina an outrageously girlish birthday cake and reacting with hostility when Nina doesn’t want to eat it, barring Nina from outside friends, treating her like a child, and preventing Nina from exploring her sexuality by being so invasive of her personal space. It’s also important to note that Erica, just like Lily and Beth, always wears black clothes - but forces Nina to wear and be surrounded by pink. \n\nErica, Beth, and Nina all engage in self-harm in a way. \nErica clearly goes overboard in protecting her daughter, even at the cost of her well-being, such as how she still tries to help Nina even after she severely damaged her hand and then even crushes it. \nBeth intentionally throws herself in front of a car. Nina possibly hallucinates Beth stabbing herself in the face. Even if this doesn’t actually happen, it still shows that Nina views Beth as someone who engages in self-mutilation - while also relating to and wanting to be Beth herself. \nNina clearly self-harms through scratching herself, working herself ragged, and finally stabbing herself. \n\nTo put it simply, Erica, Beth, Nina, and Lily are all woman who are repeats of each other - each, in a way, trying to be like each other. I think it’s also important to note that all four of these women are forced into being categorized as either “good” or “evil”, rather than being layered human beings. ",

However, if it moves too fast and shifts suddenly then the effect on society can only be disruption. Jack is the representation of isolation and the personification of what happens when this disruption occurs.  Jack begins turning homicidal when it’s suggested that they all go back to society in order to aid Danny. This, in theory, could’ve and would’ve been when the other social institutions step in and fix the faults that have begun appearing in Jack. However, believing there’s not a problem at hand, Jack insists they remain, showing the point of no return for Jack and all of his functions.  After Jack very nearly murders his own child, Danny and his mother do get away though, leaving Jack, alone, to freeze in the snow. Now what we can take away from this is that the isolation and disruption caused by Jack dies with him, allowing for his family to once again integrate into the norms and values set out by society, reclaiming life’s most fundamental domains.",

        "text": "I'm unsure of what ”You were never really here” made me feel. By the end, I was left with goosebumps and a slight smile which is just completely weird given how violent and fucked up the world that this movie portrays is.\n\nMany people have compared this movie to Taxi Driver, and while there are many similarities in the characters, I do think that the characters of Joe and Travis Bickle, and the movies themselves to be fundamentally different. To me, it's a disservice to Taxi Driver's writing to start comparing these two movies, and that's not necessarily a diss on ”You were never really here”. Taxi Driver is an exploration of a character and his transition, one of the best in cinema history, You were never really here, however, isn't so much about exploring Joe than it is giving us a glimpse into his state of mind. I think the comparison to ”Drive(2011)” that I saw earlier in another post is much more fitting, as both movies are more about the style(which is fantastic) than they are about plot or characters. Not to mention that unlike Travis Bickle, both the main characters in ”Drive” and ”You were never really here”, commit acts of ”heroism” if we simplify it. Both those movies most likely engross you more than Taxi Driver will because they emphasize much more on the mood, imagery and soundtrack, and while Taxi Driver is at least equally good on all those points, it draws so much more attention to Travis and his journey that you're analyzing as you're going, while with the other two films simply feel like an experience rather than a work of art that is meant to be picked apart and analyzed. \n\nWhen his mother died, presumably his only family or friend, Joe tries to kill himself by drowning himself along with his mother’s body in the lake. This moment is portrayed very peacefully, a light shining upon him like he's on his way to heaven. But during that he sees the little girl in front of him, drowning along with him. He realizes that if he drowns, so does she, and there's no one else to pull her up... so he pulls himself up, so he can save the little girl's life. An act of heroism if you will, and unlike Travis Bickle, it's a purely unselfish act, an act of good.\n\nI think the only thing that I disliked about the movie was the amount of PTSD flashbacks moments, I get that it's supposed to be a way for us to understand and feel what Joe has gone through and goes through every day but imo it was overdone and very clichéd. \n\nWhat did you think of the movie and the constant comparison that it gets with Taxi Driver? I personally loved it and can't wait to see it for a second time if I have the chance to. ",

        "text": "The most pivotal scene in the film, to me, is Jesse's runway transformation, revealed as a 2001-esque dream trip down the runway.  Jesse sees the lights ahead of her [as a compound triangle, like the Triforce symbol made famous in the Zelda video-games](https://imgur.com/RYqhpsT). She then sees a version of herself in a prism, a double tetrahedron.  The 2D compound triangle symbol can be folded to make a 3D tetrahedron. [In the 3D form, this object seems to resemble a diamond or jewel](https://imgur.com/5CLb5PA). The diamond is both a symbol of glamour and currency.  The version of herself Jesse sees in this prism is reflected on either surface, as though in a mirror.  [She turns to kiss her reflection on either side](https://imgur.com/bsAF3xo).\n\nThis is a powerful moment of transformation, in which Jesse goes from being aware of her own beauty, to loving it, and loving herself.  It is her transformation into a state of narcissism.  From this point her character values herself as much as everyone else does.  She's done with Dean, and the rest of the film takes on a far more surreal tone.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\nIn the beginning of the film we see Jesse [lying in a sofa that resembles the cross-section of a free-standing bathtub](https://imgur.com/QVQlSmr).  She lies in an empty vessel.  Her throat is slit and we see camera flashes, suggesting police photographing a body.  The camera pulls out to reveal a photoshoot.  I believe this is particularly foreboding of her death in an empty swimming pool, another empty vessel, drained of promise.\n\n[When Jesse stands at the end of the diving board, looking over the empty swimming pool](https://imgur.com/GpqTV95), I couldn't help but to think now that she has embraced the gift of her beauty, she is seeing it now as an empty curse.  Upon the runway when she embraced her beauty, it was freeing and empowering and her life ahead was full of value and promise.  Standing before the empty pool she has realized the emptiness of that promise; any room she is in, everyone wants to screw her or use her.  She will never be free of the predatory nature of the industry.  The photoshoot at the end occurs in front of a full pool, and depicts the beach and luxury and sun and everything the successful models have attained.  Later Ruby bathes in a full bathtub of blood.\n\nThe film is filled with predators that want the commodity of Jesse's beauty, whether for sexual gratification or other reasons. The biggest threat comes from her three rivals, who want to destroy and even steal her beauty (through cannibalism, how about that!). The cannibalism and murder might  have seemed like they came out of nowhere, yet we were softened and forewarned to this shock throughout the film.  Early in the film a rival model attempts to suck Jesse's blood when Jesse's hand is cut on broken glass.  [The wild cat in the hotel room](https://imgur.com/ExUY8zz) seems to be a symbol of feline/feminine predation. In mansion we see [a snarling taxidermied cheetah](https://imgur.com/elkh6Cz).  Not only is the film telling Jesse to get out as soon as she can, but that her biggest threat will come the rival women surrounding her.\n\n&gt;Edit: Ruby draws two Xs in lipstick on the mirror before beginning the other features of what seems to be a dead-face emoji.  This might be a stretch but maybe you can see where I'm going....\n\nThere's also some a lot of symbolism going on with Ruby that I don't quiet get. She's a makeup artist. She doesn't have absolute beauty herself, but uses makeup to mimic it.  She works at a funeral home, touching up corpses, and even molests one that seems to resemble Jesse.  After the cannibalism, she lies in a bathtub.  Later she's watering plants and [lies in a shallow ditch that we can assume in the top of Jesse's grave, surrounded by an abundance of flowers](https://imgur.com/CNtxXz7).  There's something going on with death/dirt/life/rejuvenation.  This is all still a bit mysterious to me.\n\nThings other redditors have pointed out (sorry, I didn't jot down usernames when I read these things):\n\n* Early in the film Ruby says 'Are you food, or are you sex?'.  When Ruby's sexual advances are foiled, it isn't very long before Jesse is eaten.\n* At the end, Gigi begins to feel sick, as though her body is rejecting the meal she had eaten.  She's the one that has had all the plastic surgery, and is not naturally beautiful.  Her body rejects the beauty that she has ingested, causing her to throw up and disembowel herself (bit extreme, yeah.)\n\nOther Mysteries:\n\n* Why does Gigi vomit up an eye?  Why does Jesse say that she thought the moon was one big eye, and dies on her back looking up at the moon?\n* Gigi kills herself in front of a sofa that repeats the triangle/diamond symbolism. [Are those swastikas on the walls? Could that really be unintentional](https://imgur.com/mPGekQR)?\n\nEdit: Just watching [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ2JZN2OV58) and it made me feel like I am only scratching the surface.  This is some Rob Ager level shit.",

        "text": "After watching Paul Schrader's latest film *First Reformed* this weekend, I knew that this film would merit my first review. I have been a long-time lurker of True Film and finally decided decided to take my love of film to the next level. \n\nSynopsis: At its surface*First Reformed* is a slow-burning drama that is carefully constructed through dialogue and cinematography. The film follows the story of a pastor (Ethan Hawke) of a small church in upstate New York whose life takes a sudden twist after an encounter with an erratic environmental activist and his pregnant wife (Amanda Seyfried). \n**Spoilers ahead**\n\nMy hands shake as I write these lines. The pastor, or otherwise referenced as Reverend Toller, is a former military chaplain who is struggling with the death of his son whom he encouraged to enlist in the army. Toller is the minister at First Reformed, a small historical church that seemingly has more tourists than celebrants. Evidenced by his fragile and dismal demeanor, Toller is feeling the burden of his son's death. During the film we are constantly in Toller's mind: either through his personal diary, his interpersonal interactions or through his monologues. As a viewer you feel a part of his internal struggles. \n\nToller's belief and religious framework is shaken to its core after meeting with a young women named Amy that attends First Reformed. Amy asks Toller if he would meet with her husband Michael, who wants her to get an abortion rather than bring a child into a world that he thinks is headed to an environmental apocalypse. Toller agrees to meet Michael at Mary's house. During their talk Michael obsessively preaches about the destructive effects that global warming would unleash on earth. Michael has lost all hope in the future he sees riddled with opportunistic diseases, martial law and environmental disasters. Toller talks about the resilience of man to overcome any obstacles and urges Michael to adopt a more idealistic vision in tune with God's vision. As a religious man, Toller urges courage over reason. The two men agree to meet the next day to continue their talk. Their next meeting never happens as Michael commits suicide. Even if Michael appeared to be a lost cause, in a sense I think that it was revenge that kept him going. Revenge towards the corporations, the governments, and all the political actors that were polluting and harming the earth. And revenge for other fallen activists. After Amy finds and disposes of his vest, he disposes his last motive to stay alive. \n\nAfter Michael's death, Toller's health starts failing in all aspects, emotionally, physically and spiritually. We witness his emotions manifested through his writings. He starts drinking more and isolating himself. Toller falls into a state of darkness driven by a feeling that what he has believed and taught all his life is not a sufficient answer for the suffering of the world in which he lives. Michael's ideas start to slowly grow into him. Toller finds himself searching the web on the top polluters. After some research he finds that the evangelic mega-church Abundant Life, which funds First Reformed, receives large donations from an energy company known for its reckless pollution. A certain transformation occurs, in the same way that the Pepto-bismol mixes with the whiskey. Toller is plagued by the question “Will God forgive us for what we have done to his creation?” \n\nI am still processing the Film's denouement. In a way we can choose to see that Toller finally realizes that suffering has no purpose. That if anyone should suffer it should be him. But at the same time, we are left with lingering questions regarding his spiritual transformation. Did Toller ultimately believe that God could forgive us? Is devotion to his duty as a pastor the right path? \n\nI found this to be my favorite film of 2018. It is both furious, compelling and yet darkly funny. I will most definitely have to re watch it. \n\nI'd love to discuss!\n\n\n\n",

I'm open to being wrong but sometimes it looks like that's the avenue you have to go down to break into things and be properly vetted. \n\nI'm not opposed to being educated on a topic, but sometimes I'd love to hear an opinion from someone who is actually... I can relate to a little more? Someone who isn't traditionally in 'the business' but kind of ended up in it. Even people in non-industry-dominant demographics all seem to have the same resume.\n\nI do understand why the vetting process exists, as with any occupation - lord knows I've looked and I've come across a sea of shitty fucking podcasts and websites that get twenty hits a month and they think they're going to finally get the right person to see what they wrote. \n\nCertainly though there must be people out there that are analytical and perceptive and clever writers but just didn't take the media track, but have something to contribute. I don't know how they ever really breach the wall though, especially with The Internet existing where everyone has their platform to be ignored from (often justifiably). \n",

I watched The Thing all the way through for the first time the other night too and though the effects were mind blowing in that one, I prefer The Fly for it’s emotional depth and indescribable atmosphere. Like a sci-fi tragedy.. my favorite scene was probably when Ronnie saw Brundle for the first time since the first big transformation. He’s standing in the dark at the top of some stairs and he walks down to her.. could be a Shakespearian play. I could tell she was genuinely terrified in that moment, she wasn’t even acting, was a genuine reaction. So perfect. It makes me wonder if she had seen the costume in full before that scene.",

        "text": "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is one of my favorite movies. As much as I love the show and grew up watching it, I now prefer the movie as I find every single scene intense and emotionally powerful. Really it might be the only movie I have ever seen in which every moment has this effect on me. I really see it (and think it should be seen) as a completely separate work from the show that takes place in the same universe, which is maybe why so many were disappointed with it. It is an essential part of the Twin Peaks universe, especially since season 3 came out as it connects the original series to The Return in many ways. But anyway for this review I won't be referencing the show at all, just the film.\n\nFirst of all, FWWM tackles enormous themes of life and the human experience in a much more interesting way than other films that try to. One thing the film does is to examine the nature of good and evil and answer Jeffrey from Blue Velvet's question: why is there so much trouble in this world? It questions the nature of evil using abstraction and even spiritual reasoning. Like many of Lynch's movies it uses metaphors for complex human emotions in the form of cryptic characters. In this case there are the inhabitants of the Black Lodge and especially the ultimate representation of evil, Bob. These characters feed off of human pain and suffering (Garmonbozia) and so they seek to instigate it through real human cruelty (rape, murder, abuse). The reality is that human beings are always seeking the answer to why there is evil in this world and Lynch is saying that bizarre supernatural beings who feed on suffering is no crazier than any other explanation in the grand scheme of things. In Blue Velvet, evil is portrayed as a sickness or disease but in Fire Walk With Me, it is has some cosmic meaning that we will never truly understand. \n\nOf course the center of the film is in my opinion one of the most fascinating characters in movie/TV history, Laura Palmer. In her last seven days Laura lives through some truly bizarre experiences but her character is so real and reflects the suffering that so many people go through, especially victims of abuse/incest. Being sexually abused and tormented throughout childhood her self-esteem is so low that she resorts to prostitution and drug addiction to numb the pain and feel some sense of control. She also tries to corrupt others to make herself feel better. On the other hand, deep down she is a good person and so she tries to retain some sense of innocence and goodness by providing charity and helping others. In a way the movie is kind of like Star Wars with Laura being drawn to the Dark Side but trying to stay in the light.\n\nI think it is important to note just how amazing of a performance Sheryl Lee gives in the film. I have heard performances described as \"fearless\" or \"raw\" before but didn't fully comprehend their meaning until I saw Lee's performance as Laura Palmer. She puts everything into this movie (which apparently impacted her mental health) and really brings the character to life. In single scenes she transforms from frightened, to sensual, to insane, to scary and then back again. Her performance elicits so much empathy from the viewer as we witness her psychological torment and downfall in a way that feels very true to life despite all the strangeness going on. \n\nAnother major theme of the film is the loss of innocence, or more precisely innocence being taken away. The log lady's line \"the tender boughs of innocence burns first and a wind rises and then all goodness is in jeopardy\" summarizes the film well and is a moment of realization for Laura. She realizes that her innocence is gone forever, but that she can still be a good person. She deeply values innocence and goodness in others so she protects the most important people to her, Donna and James from the corruption that has already damaged her. The green ring becomes a symbol for her maintaining goodness and warding off evil. She comes to understand that if she puts on the ring she will die but if she doesn't she will become completely taken over by the evil of Bob and inflict suffering on others. This is a metaphor for the never ending cycle of abuse that is so real for so many people. Leland was corrupted by evil in childhood, and Laura fights to end the cycle.\n\nSo in the end she makes the ultimate sacrifice and shows incredible courage in fighting against evil (which Cooper couldn't). In the last scene the appearance of the angel shows that Laura has been accepted as a good person and allowed access to the white lodge/heaven/etc. There so much more I could say about the movie but I will leave it at this for now.

        "text": "I finished Enter the Void last night and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. Upon searching it I was very surprised to see how many people on this sub in particular, seemed to vehemently dislike it or at least have significant issues with its stylistic and narrative choices. I'm defending it here in part because I'm looking for an excuse to share my thoughts and partly because I'm curious to hear the opinions of those who disliked the film as I can tell there are a lot of things I’ve missed and misunderstood in my first viewing.\n\nI believe that many of the issues people have with this movie arise from viewer's mistaken expectations for what the film is attempting to be. I have read many criticisms regarding a lack of realism, plodding pace, shallow main character and general mistaken or overambitious philosophy. I believe that these criticisms all in some manner miss the point of the film, often overanalyzing it in search of some deeper level of meaning that just isn't there. It is easy to be fooled by the buddhist motifs and dramatic almost cautionary tale esque plot-line, but this is not a philosophical movie. I do not believe there is any deep meaning or lesson embedded in it. It is certainly possible to learn lessons from it, I did myself, but this is a peripheral effect of the story, not its purpose. The film is the opposite of subtle, often banging the viewer over the head with the most explicit foreshadowing and predictable plot arcs possible. These would be major failings of a normal movie, but this is not a movie, it’s a DMT trip.\n\nIt is difficult to understand what a psychoactive trip feels like if you’ve never experienced it, and as such impossible to recognize how closely this entire film mimics such a trip without that experience. Regardless, it is important to know that DMT is famous for allowing people to live entire lives in moments, rendering them inconsolable as the life they lived as well as the spouses, kids, lifelong friends and confidants within it turn out to have been nothing more than a figment of their imagination. I would suggest that this is exaggerated, however it gives you the context to understand the potency of the drug. Although many would disagree, it seems self evident to me that the entirety of the film after Oscar was shot, happens in a few seconds. The concept of one’s life flashing before their eyes is common to the point of cliche but Noe’s idea of exploring the effects of the most potent known psychoactive substance on this cliche is simultaneously refreshing, intense and disturbing.\n\nThe entirety of the film after Oscar was shot revolves around the conversation between Oscar and Alex at the very start of the movie in their discussion of the Book of the Dead. Alex explains that once you die you experience what he calls “a big trip” incomparable to that of DMT. Your spirit leaves your body and you see your whole past, as well as everything happening around you. You see different lights of different sizes and colors that are meant to lead you to higher planes of existence. However most people don’t want to leave this life, so they resist and it turns into a bad trip, which can only be escaped through reincarnation. He defines a bad trip as a nightmare in which your fears become reality. From minute 37~ on, this is a comprehensive plot of the entire film.\n\nOscar’s attempts to conceptualize and come to terms with his death in his final moments are heavily influenced by both this conversation, which occurred when he was in an extremely impressionable state due to his psychedelics usage as well as his previous reading (and liking) of the Book of the Dead. As such he is forced to face his fears, past present and future until he can “escape” them through the cycle of reincarnation. Tragically locked into this mindset due to his predisposition towards it and his drug abuse. \n\nMany people are confused by the flashbacks in this movie, assuming that the veracity of the flashbacks implies some overarching level of truth throughout the entirety of the disembodied sequence. However I’d urge you to consider, how can one’s greatest fears of the past be anything but certainly true events? Likewise, how could one’s greatest fears of the future ever be certainly true events?\n\nThe reason the plot is so predictable in the sequences that occur after Oscar’s death are precisely because he is drawing upon his knowledge and past experiences to fill in the blanks and predict a future full of his fears. Reality is far more creative than fiction as the creation of fiction relies solely upon the evidence one already possesses. He draws upon his assumptions of Linda and Mario’s relationship to predict that they would be having sex during his murder, culminating in her abortion and the general destruction of her mental state. He assumes that because Alex is his friend, and present outside the club he was shot in that he'd be forced into hiding from the police and living on the streets. He assumes that because Victor betrayed him as revenge for having slept with his mother, that he would get into a blowout fight with his parents and get kicked out of their home. All of his friends and acquaintances end up in dangerous positions, all because of Oscar, this is his fear.\n\nHe is only able to escape this cycle of fear through reincarnation. In a delusion that includes a blatant plagiarism of Alex’s roommate’s model Tokyo. He imagines a love hotel consumed by a massive orgy, identical to a hypothetical he described at the start of the movie. Within this orgy he sees many potential avenues of reincarnation, symbolized by a glowing yellow light however he follows Alex’s directions and waits until he finds the light that suits him best and thus the life that suits him best, that of Alex and Linda having sex. He is “reincarnated” successfully escaping the nightmare and presumably finally entering the void, achieving a peaceful death.\n\nI feel that many people, particularly those who digest and analyze films on the plot-centric basis of meanings and messages unfairly ridicule a movie that is more properly understood as an art, based on the feelings and emotions it invokes and the overall experience it provides. I do not use the word art as a pretentious term in an attempt to imply that art is a superior classification to movie. Rather I simply believe that Enter the Void’s classification as a movie, particularly an indie one, subjects it to unfair preconceptions and expectations that detract from its enjoyability for many viewers. As a movie Enter the Void is mediocre but as an experience it is a 10/10.",

        "text": "I just saw *First Reformed* yesterday and really enjoyed it. I can never really delve into the semiotics of movies since I have trouble parsing it out, but I do want to discuss some of the visual and auditory choices made throughout the movie and how it relates to the main character Rev. Toller. If I had to use one word to discuss the aesthetic of the film it would be austere. \n\nThe first choice is simple the lack of music. There is almost no music throughout the film which seems to mirror the sparse Upstate New York environment and Toller's own emotional state. He suffered a tragedy and had closed a particularly terrible chapter in his life prior to the start of the movie and when we are introduced to him we see him living a very simple life. Which brings us to the next point...\n\nHis environment is very empty. The movie takes place during the long Upstate New York winter with no vegetation around and snow on the ground. The color palate is full of greyscale, from the overcast skies to the pure white of the chapel. Toller's own living quarters are comprised solely of essentials. His \"living room\" is a single chair. This is a reflection of Toller trying to create order within his own life, and it sharpens to focus in every scene. There is very little for the eye to wander to. This can lead to a claustrophobic feeling at certain points. \n\nI say only certain points because the cinematography is composed to two main types of shots: the close up, and a larger framing shot (pardon my lack of proper terminology). Most of the conversations are shot statically with both subjects in the frame. There is no \"shot-reverse shot\" here, but there are closeups. Interestingly, the close ups of Toller are not done to show him speak, but usually to show his reactions, brilliantly performed by Ethan Hawke, I might add. These close-ups show a real pain and struggle in his face, and are shot without the other subjects shoulder or back of their head in the frame. You are just looking at Toller, in a very close up shot, that lends a strong sense of being boxed in (aside, this is mirrored in the near 1:1 ratio of the film itself). The contrast between these two shots seem to me to be showing an outward stability vs. inward turmoil struggle. Toller remains very composed throughout most of the movie, but as the events unravel and his own mental state becomes challenged the distinction between his created stability and the inevitable collapse becomes blurred. \n\nIn conclusion I feel that this movie was shot with a very specific purpose in mind (well, duh) and was able to convey a lot with how the characters were framed and the general visual tone. Any thoughts and comments? ",

Do you take an entertainment approach. Where something you loved, but may be technically flawed can get a 5? Or do you take a more analytical approach. Where rewatchability alone isn't the measurement?\n\nI tend to fall in the former. Using The Circus as an example.

I think it focuses on the life of the troops, but I imagine there were many things addressing colonization that I just can't remember.\n\n*Les Salauds* I saw maybe two years ago. As far as I recall, this theme of colonization is not present at all? Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI guess my question for those of you more familiar with her work is:\n\na\\) To what extent is this theme a consistent one in her work? To what extent is it present in all her work?\n\nb\\) What exactly is she showing or saying? What is her goal and how does she accomplish this? She's obviously for decolonization, but it seems her films are more nuanced than that and more focused on the tactile, the body, and mood. So in what ways does the way in which she crafts her films contribute to the theme in a unique way?",

Wasn't concerned about the past nor the future. Enjoying life as it is, whether it has ups and downs. His girlfriend for example aimed to be a country singer, her look was more her concern than the music. Her goal wasn't the music, it was the success. Paterson wrote poems because he liked it. And it was mostly for himself. People around him felt discontent. His boss at the bus company, the lover who couldn't bear losing his loved one, the bartender who stole money from his wife. He also seems to interact with these people as accepting but not understanding. But when he meets someone likeminded he opens up in a different way. Like the rapper washing his clothes, or the girls who also writes poems, or the japanese man who came to Paterson for it's poet history. Paterson is also challenged, he seems to overcome obstacles that others get hung up upon. When the bus stops working or when his girlfriend buys the expensive guitar. He is challenged by this later on though, when the dog eats his notebook. However, he overcomes when he meets someone like him. The japanese man, aha. And in the end it didn't faze him.\n\nI got a bit jealous almost, he's \\*just\\* a bus driver. But he seems more content than anyone else. I wake up every day and think about how things will get better. He wakes up and he's living it.\n\nMaybe I'm rambling or/and you don't agree. I don't usually write anything about movies after I've seen them. But I kind of felt I wanted to get it down right after the movie. Thanks for reading. :\\)",

It seems a very Western concern in cinema, as the only examples I’ve found have been from European countries like France (Time Of The Wolf), Switzerland (Cargo, 2009), or Spain (The Dark Hour).\nHas anyone found this to be the case? Is there a wealth of post-apocalyptic or dystopian films from elsewhere that I’ve missed somehow? If not, why does it seem to be a primarily Western concern?",

        "text": "The past couple of years or so I feel I have witnessed a change in the wind, politically speaking, in film. Whilst the topics covered are not necessarily new, the kind of screen time and reaction they're receiving feels different. Perhaps I am being overly optimistic about a positive change in the industry but there have been some key moments both on and off screen that I want to explore. These will cover racism, sexuality and sexism. \n\nAn example of this positive movement on-screen is Moonlight; a not-so-mainstream but not-too-arthouse film about black and gay communities. I think we can all agree that it was a great film and thoroughly deserved its acclaim. A black director with black lead actors talking about issues of sexuality. I could write a whole post on why I love Moonlight but I'll avoid the temptation to tangent. \n\nOn the other side of the art house Oscar-bait spectrum is Black Panther. Omitting the glaringly white faces of Andy Sirkus and Martin Freeman, it was a totally black cast and absolutely destroyed the box office. Say what you will about how good it (or any other Marvel film) is, it set a precedence for what film audiences would pay to see. I ignored Marvel studios awkwardly fiddle with the idea of exploring deeper race issues but I loved it's sci fi celebration of African culture nonetheless. \n\nOther films get political with varying success. Get Out was incredible, finding itself somewhere in the middle of that arthouse-popcorn spectrum and tackling so many issues in such an accessible way. 12 Years a Slave was a harrowing and important film to make but I wouldn't say it was progressive like the others I've mentioned. Same with Fences; incredible performances but was basically a black version of any Arthur Miller play. And this level of progressiveness and relevance is an important distinction. (EDIT: this was a pretty ignorant comment from me about Fences. I got wound up haha - apologies) \n\nFilm is an incredibly powerful platform with international reach. Changing the rhetoric of what is marketable or what is fashionable or which actors are popular and worth investing in will always have political ramifications. John Boyega being one of the main characters in Star Wars, then in the film Detroit and then Pacific Rim's sequel makes for very positive reading. He is starring in the biggest films as well as doing the important ones, representing his interests in relevant and current political affairs. He's a figurehead and pioneer in the modern acting world by being young, talented and black. \n\nOff-screen we see the degradation and condemnation of acts committed by people like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K.. Three powerful white men at the very top of their game being toppled by a just and right movement, mostly led by women. \n\nI had a pretty challenging discussion the other day about the new Blade Runner film. I really love Blade Runner and really really enjoyed one of my favourite director's take on it. I became immediately defensive when I heard it being called anti-feminist and misogynistic. Mostly with regard to the AI, prostitute sex scene. When I watched that for the first time I thought it was one of most interesting  thought-provoking and beautiful sex scenes I had seen.\n\nAfterwards I reflected critically; Is the film suffering from systematic and institutionalised sexism? \"White men grapple with their idea of what it is to be human through death and sex.\" Is it representing women well at all? \"Main female characters are sexy Artificial Intelligences and/or plot tools to test white man's idea of identity.\" \n\nWhilst I still think the scene was amazing with how it dealt with the idea of what it meant to be and feel human, it was still through the POV of attractive white male Ryan Gosling, essentially getting a crazy Sci fi threesome. I don't know what I think but it did make me be slightly more critical. One wonders, would Blade Runner be a better film if the main character was a black lesbian or is that just unsubtle and crude? How do you make a film about human identity represent all humans?\n\nIt made me question every film and their motives in fact. \n\nWonder Woman turned out to be a wonderful portrayal of a man's idea of what a powerful women should look like. I guess women are better at writing feminist stories because, well, they're women. \n\nSo does film have a political fallacy?\n\nWas Black Panther a success for the black community or is it a success for Kevin Feige? Is Moonlight shedding light on race and sexuality issues more than before or does the academy want to appear a certain way and decided it was the most delicious of the Oscar baits? Is Hollywood dictating what we want to watch and what political movements are important because they decide to listen and make space for it because they are the white and powerful and actually we're being deceived? \n\nOR are we shaping the content that is being created? Pressuring them to stay current, to keep up with us and making positive changes for under represented groups of people? \n\nA chicken or the egg type predicament perhaps. \n\nIn any case, I think things are improving. How much is not clear and I think film is a long way behind many other industries. But I'm enjoying the current evolution of film and these films that come out to promote diversity and openness, encourage movements and challenge society. \n\nThanks for reading\n\n\n\n\n",

To make a long story short, I broke up with my girlfriend and I felt like I needed to do it, but it truly did break my heart when I saw her reaction. So I decided to put to this movie on to distract me and just to cope y'know?\n\nSomething I've noticed is just how much soul and passion Llewyn puts into his craft. How he really is striving to be successful but personal relationships and life keep kicking him in the nuts. He even says at one point \"I'm done, I'm tired. And I don't mean by sleep,\" meaning that he's essentially giving up on music. Which is ashamed because he does have talent, before when he was talking with his sister, he refused to be considered \"normal\". He doesn't want a normal lifestyle and even becomes cynical to any up-and-comer musician. His craft is not just for fun anymore but work as in one scene he lashes out at the dinner telling them not to sing along to his song because it means something more to him. Not only that but it obviously reminds him of his partner.\n\nHonestly I get the way he feels. His attitude is a bit rude and assholeish but it is within good reason. He wants to be successful but he's just not getting it. I can relate because back when I was 14 (as stupid as it may sound) I wanted to be a rapper. Yes, I was one of those \"check out my soundcloud fam\" rappers and so forth. I would work day and night trying to write the best songs I could. Now that I'm 22, I've released that it was just a phase. That truly it use to be fun, but I never really saw the results and that it's best I move on. But something keeps pulling me back, begging me to keep doing music. Which is why it was painful to see Llewyn when he performs with all of his heart to the venue owner just to have him say \"I don't see a lot of money in this\". And when the venue owner tells him to get back with his partner, Llewyn's response \"That's some good advice\" kinda implying that maybe Llewyn should kill himself. Music just wasn't for him, but he feels like he's not good at anything else.\n\nEven though rap and folk are two very different genres, I admire the fire and passion Llewyn had for his craft. And I think anybody trying to break into any other genre can relate as well.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, but what are y'all thoughts on this film??\n\nAlso if you're reading this, you're awesome and have an awesome day!",

A critical term, coined by the French about the American films during the 40's. Yet the films had their codes and conventions and have been called a genre later. They were shot in the shadows. Dodgy areas, filled to the brim with [smoke and dilapidated buildings](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/solo-movie-trailer-images-13-600x250.png). It was not the highly colorized wonderland we'd seen in *The Wizard of Oz* or *The Adventures of Robin Hood*. The colors were stripped away. I feel like this is at many times what they were aiming for visually in *Solo*. The first scenes are almost monochromatic. *Mad Max: Fury Road* did something similar in the [night scenes.](https://media.giphy.com/media/l67H7ywZmhcvm/giphy.gif). Visually it reminds you a lot of German Expressionism, which film noir borrowed from. You have that in the beginning of *Solo*. And then it keeps going. The war scenes are gritty, dark and colorless. The docking [station is filled with fog](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/solo-movie-trailer-images-9-600x251.png) with only the light coming from small bulbs on the ground. Low-key lighting in [many places of the movie](https://blowoutbuzz.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/solo.png?w=636\\)).\n\nI feel like all of this was present in *Solo*. When Qi'ra looks out the window at the end of the movie, it almost looked like the light hit the inside of the room like [venetian blinds](http://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/solo-trailerbreakdown-qira-closeup-700x290.jpg). Vos' place also looked unique when it was draped in one color. \n\nYet the movies not only looked dark. They told dark stories about crooks and detectives. Murderers and corrupt people. Film noir had so much moral ambiguity. The quote that is beaten down on us about assuming everyone will betray you. And we see that with Han. \n\n**The femme fatale**\n\n[Qi'ra](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/solo-a-star-wars-story-emilia-clarke-600x251.jpg) is obviously the femme fatale of the movie. A seductive woman like that is a classic. Just based on that screenshot, Emilia Clarke looks like she stepped right out of a 1940's classic. And a femme fatale is a mysterious character, one who you can't really place, which might betray you at the end. Han is seduced, with a classical and romantic picture of all of this, but Qi'ra is entangled with something horrible, yet ambiguous at the start. She will in the end betray Han. \n\nA film-noir includes gangsters. It includes people getting into a life of crime without the intention. It includes heists and double-crossings. And the heroes (often times the detectives) can be cynical and vulgar skeptics. Most of them aren't classy and rich guys.\n\nThe coaxium at the end serves almost like the MacGuffin of the story. Something we can see in this type of films. And bars, lounges and [gambling](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/02/09/8-Lando-Solo-Trailer.w1200.h630.jpg) sites are frequent in film noir. I know we've seen bars on *Star Wars* before, but never have we seen such a [1940's Art Deco bar until this one](https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/solo-trailerbreakdown-fancybar-wide-700x291.jpg). An art style that also influenced film noir. \n\n**John Powell's music**\n\nIt seems like Powell embraces this notion, because the score sounds very old-school at times. The romantic tension in Lando's closet is [heightened by the strings coming out like a classical Hollywood score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWvGiqM_Tjw). Especially from [1:25](https://youtu.be/GWvGiqM_Tjw?t=1m25s).\n\nThe piano theme as well. Very classical, and we rarely hear piano themes in *Star Wars* as well, so it sticks out. It's from [2:34 in \"Testing Allegiance\"](https://youtu.be/ubcqxXHik-U?t=2m34s).\n\n\nI am not saying this is the only thing the movie aims for. It has a lot of western genre conventions going for it. The desert (both the snow and the sand) planets. And a lot more. But I feel like discussing the film noir tendencies could be interesting. Especially seeing as they came during/after World War II, which was a visual inspiration for The Empire in the original trilogy. And still is during this time. And after the film noir days ended we got the colorful widescreen epics that were supposed to lure people back into the cinemas. \n\nDo you agree? Do you have more examples of this in the film? How do you think the movie combines western, film noir and space opera? \n \n\n\n\n",

This is wildly simplified and a bit myopic, but on the set of Blade 3 Wesley Snipes wouldn't come out of his trailer, and was high all the time. So the Director used more footage of Biel and Reynolds, and Reynolds got a bunch more screen time by just being himself, ad libbing, etc. Someone on the set of that film told Ryan he was like the comic book character Deadpool. Ryan didn't know who that was, read up, and then carried the torch for a decade, especially after they destroyed Deadpool in that Wolverine film.\n\nFlash forward, and we have an R-rated Superhero comedy. Then that R-rating gives Logan the go ahead to do a straight up superhero western drama. Now we have the New Mutants coming out with the Demon Bear saga (comic story line) as a horror film.\n\nSo, after Nolan was able to craft an epic universe for his Batman, we found a more sophisticated notion of the superhero film, far beyond colorful spandex. Then we see genre specific superhero films. And yes, Marvel Studios has made a powerful machine that somehow churns out competent and enjoyable films that are also complex and have depth. And yes, they've taken over the movie world in a way that makes Star Wars seem dated and tiny.\n\nSo.... in your opinion, where will superhero films go? Will they ever go away? As we near the end of about a decade story arc for the Avenger crew, and start seeing more diverse and complex notions of superhero films, what do you expect in the future from the different studios?",

Trying to make this a weekly topic.\n\nAkira Kurosawa is a legendary director whom I am sure tops most cinephiles best director list. It was a no\\-brainer the director's work would be featured in Film Frame Friday. The Japanese filmmaker was a genius behind the camera and most of his films are known for standout shots. I could write about how great the director is, and how his work changed the way cinema is viewed, but instead let's look at the **cinematography** of his 1957 film\\* Throne of Bloo\\*d.\n\nI highly recommend reading this with the link due to the sheer amount of gifs, and picture comparisons. [https://thefilmera.com/2018/05/25/film\\-frame\\-friday\\-throne\\-of\\-blood/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/05/25/film-frame-friday-throne-of-blood/)\n\n*Throne of Blood* isn't just a typical samurai film but an adaption of W*illiam Shakespeare's Macbeth*. Instead of medieval Scotland, the film takes place in feudal Japan. The film features powerful acting by Toshiro Mifune, but what makes it stand out among his work is an amazing atmosphere, and use of movement.\n\n&gt;It’s a great adaptation of Macbeth, particularly in how it translates the dialogue of Shakespeare’s play into a spare visual style rather than relying on language. It jettisons anything that isn’t essential, and a number of key scenes actually play out off screen \\(enhancing its eerie stage\\-like quality\\). \\-Graham Austin, Filmera Writer\n\nI will never forget the first time I watched *Throne of Blood*, how the gorgeous visuals, great use of the environment, and downright eerie atmosphere gave me goosebumps. Til this day I point people to this film out of his vast filmography simply because the camera work is outstanding.\n\n&gt;How did Akira Kurosawa go about framing the scenes of this film? Simple, by using elements drawn from **Noh.**\n\nNoh is a Japanese form of theatre that focuses on drama, dance, and music. Created in the 14th century, it is the oldest form of classical theatre in the world.\n\nExcerpt provided by [**Japan\\-Guide.com**](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2091.html) \\-\n\n&gt;Noh theater is structured around song and dance. **Movement is slow, language is poetic, the tone is monotonous, and costumes are rich and heavy**. Plots are usually drawn from legend, [history](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2126.html), literature and contemporary events. Themes often relate to **dreams, supernatural worlds, ghosts, and spirits**.Noh is performed on a **square stage** with a roof that is supported at its four corners by pillars. All sides of the stage are open except for the back side which consists of a wall with a painted image of a pine tree. A bridge runs at an oblique angle off the stage for performers to enter the stage. Noh used to be typically staged outdoors, but recently modern indoor theaters have also become a common venue.One key element of noh are the **masks** which the shite wears. They tell the audience what kind of character is being portrayed. Frequently used masks represent demons and spirits, as well as women and men of various ages. The masks are carved from blocks of Japanese cypress. Their three dimensional properties allow skilled actors to induce a variety of expressions with changes in head orientation.Costumes consist of multiple layers and textures that create an effect of resplendent elegance but also a bulky, massive figure. Expressiveness is enhanced by props, most notably a folding fan. Closed, partly closed or open, the fan may represent any object as suggested by its shape and handling, for example a dagger or a lantern.\n\nThe facial expressions and makeup the characters displayed is an homage to Noh mask. Notice the layers of clothes the characters wear in the film, to give off a powerful yet still elegant demeanor.\n\nMacbeth and Noh were a perfect match, and Kurosawa made excellent use of the environment to display the supernatural and dreamlike nature of the film.\n\nIt is difficult to believe  Kurosawa originally only wanted to produce this film and not direct. Had he chosen to produce it we may have been robbed of some of the best fog and mist effects to ever grace cinema.\n\n&gt;It was a very hard film to make. We decided that the main castle set had to be built on the slope of Mount Fuji, not because I wanted to show this mountain but because it has precisely the stunted landscape that I wanted. And it is usually foggy. I had decided that I wanted lots of fog for this film... Making the set was very difficult because we didn't have enough people and the location was so far from Tokyo. Fortunately, there was a U.S. Marine Corps base nearby, and they helped a great deal; also a whole MP battalion helped us out. We all worked very hard indeed, clearing the ground, building the set. Our labor on this steep fog\\-bound slope, I remember, absolutely exhausted us; we almost got sick.\\- Akira Kursowa\n\nWriting about this film made me appreciate the director even more and actually taught me a lot about the influences Noh had on this film, which Kurosawa says he prefers over **Kabuki**. I highly recommend this film, and it is the perfect entry point into the work of the legendary Akira Kurosawa. I am looking forward to writing another cinematography piece on his work in film.",

        "text": "https://youtu.be/4x5_nFDD0XE\n\nAdapting and award winning stage play to the silver screen could be a treacherous task, but when you have masters such as Roger Deakins, Meryl Streep, and Philip Seymour Hoffman at the helm, it’s a whole other story. Doubt is written and directed by John Patrick Slattery about every MRA’s paragon, a false rape accusation. \n \n\n\nThese are expressive performances. I suppose the material sort of calls for it, being that it originated as a stage play, but these actors have found ways of communicating vast amounts of character and emotion through subtle looks, glances, or even silent pauses. These actors do a perfect job of taking the big, loud, and emotive performances from the play, and scaling them down for film. This film is a textbook example of how moments of pause in between lines of dialogue can be just as engrossing, informative, and emotionally impactful as a rousing monologue. This piece especially calls for a powerhouse of performance because depending on how the actor interprets the writing and translates that into their performance the audience will feel differently, yet if two different people watch this film they may come away with different conclusions. That is the power of these performances. The energy being thrown back and forth in these scenes is enthralling, seeing two of the best modern actors feeding into a scene is a sight to behold. The ability to compress and express all that emotion and information into such a compact and subtle performance is truly magical. \n \n\n\nRoger Deakins is a household name in cinephile circles, meaningless name drops abound, it seems as if the internet only knows of one cinematographer. The same applies to Spielberg as a director, Sorkin as a screenwriter, and Murch as an editor. But I would rather have people begin to learn what a DP does, what an editor does, and so on than have them be ignorant sheep. And these are well-known names for a good reason. Deakins has the insurmountable task of taking a uniquely cinematic work, and make it utterly cinematic. Deakins used the Arriflex 535B and Zeiss Master Prime Lenses to create a certain fluidity and momentum to the camerawork and editing that keeps the audience interested, as well as adding value and meaning to the words on the page that could not be gained through the stage play. The composition is visually varied yet informative, and some of the imagery from the sermons have been brought to light with the power of film, and the cut. While the visual metaphors are obvious, they are still meaningful. The staging and framing of the action is meaningful as well as visually interesting. But those are awfully general statements, what does Deakins do that separates him from his competition? As opposed to Tom Hooper and his use of the such dutch, these dutch angles are used with purpose to benefit the story. Deakins brings beauty that means something as opposed to Lubezki bringing obvious and obtrusive beauty. Deakins has said that the the audience should never be distracted by the camera while Lubezki loves pulling and pushing the camera around for dramatic effect. Lubezki is an engineer while Deakins is a sculptor. With engineering there are blueprints and formulas that anyone can follow if they have access to them. With sculpting there is no formula, and it changes based on what best compliments the story of the film, rather than being pretty on a surface level. Deakins is quoted as saying, “There's nothing worse than an ostentatious shot. Or some lighting that draws attention to itself, and you might go, 'Oh, wow, that's spectacular.” His work is beautiful, subtle, complex, and most importantly natural. A frame shot by Deakins is always striking, but never so striking that it takes viewers out of the story, instead it feeds into the story as a way to complement and contribute to the narrative. In doing research for this film and its cinematography, I came upon a lot of people who love name drop Deakins and praise his “good cinematography,” all while confusing cinematography with directing and editing. Spoiler alert - most people know what cinematography is. The internet just uses \"bad cinematography\" as shorthand for \"I can't think of a legitimate reason to criticize this movie but I don't like it so I'm going to speak in vague platitudes that I've seen other people say before\". A typical redditor is almost never talking about actual cinematography when they bring it up. I’m guilty of this. But I’m learning. I’d like to leave you with a poem, Introduction to Poetry, by Billy Collins.\n \n\n\nThis film was adapted from stage play to screenplay, two incredibly different mediums that require two distinct writing styles in terms of structure, pace, setting, character, and dialogue. As opposed to something like Carrol where the dialogue is a fencing match of sorts, much of the dialogue in this film seems to flow, each line feeding into the next, simultaneously setting up and paying off while forging the narrative. Many say that restriction breeds creativity, and the theatre is incredibly restrictive, while film is nearly limitless. Things that were merely hinted at in subtle dialogue in the play have been physically manifested into obvious metaphors. For example, expanding the cast from the 4 that were in the stage production means that the possible victim is noticeably missing. Without him, the audience can’t gain any insight by looking into his eyes, they can’t read his performance for information. The effect is that the playing field remains even between the priest and his accuser. This element is missing from the film adaptation, leading to less doubt and more certainty than the film’s subject matter and title call for. As well as having a cat physically catch a mouse at a key juncture is an incredibly literal metaphor that lacks the subtlety that was present in the play. The LA Times points out that \"Doubt\" threatens to become “meteorologically overwrought” by putting all kinds of wind, rain and even thunder into the story whenever it feels the proceedings won't work on their own. I think these sound effects heighten the tension and add subtext to the scenes they are featured in. Some of these techniques are a bit too literal for my tastes, but they add copious amounts of subtext to an already layered work. One of the things that is so interesting about theater to me is that it requires participation from an audience for the experience to be complete, because we don’t see the children nor most of the events taking place, we have the ability to participate by creating them in our imagination. It’s difficult to compare the theatre and film. Nothing can rival the physical intimacy of theater, the presence of the actor on stage. Experimental theater allows performances to move around, and interact with the audience. Theater has no tricks: the acting is uninterrupted by editing, singing undubbed, and dance unenhanced. It's \"real\" in a sense. Plays constantly change. The script is the same in each show, but the performances are different every night. The way I deliver a line one evening might be different to the way I said it before. The person receiving the line now has been effected in a different way and so they say their next line not only verbally in response to what i said, but emotionally to how I said it. Add in any number of variables - audience reaction, mistakes, or understudies playing parts and you so many things can happen. All whilst serving the story and emotion of the play. The brilliance of live performances are that you were actually there. You felt it with that actor, and it was personal. People laugh cry and shout in front of you and it's a real once in a lifetime occurrence. Theatre truly works when you are sitting in the audience and you realise that you are all feeling the same. The crowd laughs together, they cry together, they wait in bated breath together. They respond as a group, each person having a subtly different but somehow unified experience. What the actor must achieve in film is getting each moment right. They move from moment to moment in no particular order and often without any time to rehearse properly. Film actors have to work quickly to put a scene together in a film that then exists forever while theatre actors may work for months to achieve a performance that only lasts one or two performances. But in theater, it feels better. Life feels better. There are fewer surprises. You arrive at the theatre every night at the same time, seeing the same people, having had a similar day. The actor feels secure. It’s ritualistic and welcoming and unlike anything else. When we see a good theatre show we marvel at how, with so few resources, the performers took us on a journey into ourselves. We are shocked. We know that there were no tricks. It wasn't \"fixed later\". It happened in front of us. It's unquestionable. And it's why I am, and will continue to be, drawn back to the theatre. \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8m1heq/blow_out_compositional_motivation_vs_the_idiot/",
        "text": "Watching *Blow Out* for the first time last night got me thinking about compositional motivation. This is a term David Bordwell uses to describe elements in a film that *have to* be there for the narrative to progress. \\(His meaning is more complicated, but this'll do for our purposes.\\) You know that thing where you're watching a slasher movie or a thriller or whatever, and the bad guy \"seems\" to be dead but who knows and there's a gun on the floor and the protagonist straight up runs away, and everybody starts yelling at the screen, *why doesn't she just pick the gun up and shoot him in the head?!* Well, compositional motivation is the answer. If she did, the movie would end right then. Or like in rom coms, when there's a stupid misunderstanding between the budding couple in the second act, and they don't just like sit down and have a conversation about it and realize that no, the gigolo that Ginger Rogers hired to give her grounds for divorce isn't Fred Astaire, but the sleazy Italian guy with the pencil moustache. Improbable coincidences fit into this category too.* In What's* Up\\*, *Doc? there are not only four identical plaid traveling cases, but their owners are staying* in four adjacent hotels roo\\*ms. But if they weren't, none of the whacky hijinks would ensue, and then we wouldn't have much of a movie, would we?\n\nAnyway, you get the idea. All narrative films need to fall back on compositional motivation from time to time. What I'm wondering now, though, is where we as film viewers draw the line between it and the idiot plot. If you don't know it, the phrase was [popularized](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/narrow-margin-1990) by Roger Ebert, who defines it simply as \"Any plot containing problems that would be solved instantly if all of the characters were not idiots.\" A recent example of the phrase from [Tim Brayton's](https://www.alternateending.com/2017/12/star-wars-last-jedi-2017.html) review of *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*:\n\n&gt;Then there's the subplot that's basically just a middle\\-tier episode of the 2000s *Battlestar Galactica* \\(and it makes sense that Star *Wars would steal *from Battlestar *Galactica, given that the original ve*rsion of Battlestar *Galactica was stealing from Star Wars\\): hotshot pilot Poe Dameron \\(Oscar Isaac\\) is too impetuous and makes poor choices, putting him on the wrong side of fleet leaders General Leia Organa \\(the late Carrie Fisher\\) and Vice Admiral Holdo \\(Laura Dern\\), in a study of the tension between military leaders and the people they command that is, I am sorry to say, an Idiot Plot. Like, a pure\\-blooded, absolutely flawless version of an Idiot Plot: there is not one good reason for Holdo to withhold the information she withholds, there is even less reason for Poe to withhold the information he withholds, and a full goddamn hour of this movie takes place solely because they are both being dumbasses. And it's not even a productive hour \\- the plot is *advanced in not the smallest, most insignificant detail because of this hour. It goes exactly where it would have gone anyway, and all we get for it is Dern being amazing in a thready little nothing role, and Isaac being frankly not all that great in a heaving cliché of a role.\n\nSo this is the problem. On the one hand, for stories to work, characters sometimes have to do things that normal people wouldn't do, or at least wouldn't do if they were thinking clearly. Stories need conflict; they need obstacles that can't be too readily overcome. On the other hand, at some point those narratively\\-necessary choices shade over into characters just being complete and total bozos – to the point where their integrity as characters, our identification with them, and our immersion in the story itself can all suffer.\n\nWhich brings us at last to De Palma's *Blow Out*. I've written this whole thing, I guess, because I rarely much *care* about plot lapses and illogicities, but for some reason, I found myself caring deeply about the protagonists' decision that sets up the final act. Here's the heavily spoiled summary:\n\n&gt;!Jack \\(Travolta\\) and Sally \\(Allen\\) are in possession of a film and soundtrack proving that an important dude's death was murder. Jack is trying to get together with a reporter to make the whole thing public. What he doesn't know is that the killer, Burke \\(Lithgow\\), has tapped into his home phone, and has not only blocked the reporter's \\(and Sally's\\) calls all day, but has imitated the reporter and set up a meeting with Sally – alone – at the train station. She goes to Jack's place and tells him all that. \"Your phone's been busy all day.\" Weird, he says, it works fine here. \"The reporter set up a meeting with me alone.\" Weird, he says, I didn't give him your number. Also weird that he would want to meet alone. Maybe he just wants to talk me into coming on the air, she suggests, as though that's not also exactly what Jack wants. Jack knows, and articulates multiple times, how weird the whole situation is.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!So okay, you're in that position. What do you do? Here are some suggestions in descending order of sensibility. 1. Call the reporter back and ask him what's up. 2. Go together to the train station to see what's up. 3. Put a wire on Sally, though your wires have already gotten one guy killed and you have \\[edit: no\\] actual reason to mistrust the reporter, and send her in by herself to meet said reporter though she doesn't know what he looks like. Can you guess which option our heroes chose?!&lt;\n\nSo of course, on one level, this colossally numbskulled decision has to be made, compositionally. If they call the reporter, they learn the whole meeting's a trap; if Jack goes in with Sally, he knows the \"reporter\" isn't who he claims. And insofar as all that motivates the killer suspense and insane denoument \\(e.g. fireworks\\), I'm glad it's there. But it's just so damn stupid. *Especially* for Jack. Sally's kind of a dolt anyway \\(and a gratingly terrible performance, I'm afraid\\), but Jack seems wise enough throughout to know how in over his head he is, and react with appropriate caution. And I really don't think this is a J.J. Gittes' hubris\\-and\\-utter\\-lack\\-of\\-critical\\-self\\-consciousness\\-leads\\-to\\-tragic\\-ending kind of thing. It just felt...wrong. Incoherent.

        "text": "So I'll start off saying that I found this movie kind of...corny? Maybe it's because it's hard to both read the subtitles and feel the performance of the actors at the same time, i'm not exactly sure. I'd heard good things, and watched 'I Saw the Devil' a few nights before this. Which I found incredible and tense. \n\nBut as Man from Nowhere starts to build, and the last ~30 minutes or so, it really caught me off guard. The fight choreography was equally beautiful and violent. Obviously similar to Oldboy, but very much like the more recent John Wick films as well. The corny-ness of it also reminded me quite a lot of Man on Fire, another movie I like a lot.\n\nI'm not sure how to describe my thoughts on this very well. Is this supposed to be kind of schlocky but excellent movie by Korean standards, or even like a Tarantino movie? Korean movies are definitely some that I've enjoyed a lot recently but sometimes the schlock is hard to get through. Is that basically all or most of Korean film? \n\nI think the next ones I'll be watching are the other two Vengeance trilogy movies. Any others I should put in my queue to check out, or any ideas or themes or concepts that I should learn or keep in mind when watching Korean film? I think Memories of Murder is the only Korean film I've seen that doesn't have that schlocky aesthetic, which is one of my favorite movies and probably the one that got me interested in experiencing more Korean cinema. \n\nBack to Man from Nowhere, I definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Not my favorite of the Korean movies I've seen but probably worth watching and experiencing for that last fight scene alone to be honest. And with how brutal and honest about killing off and ruining main characters seems to be in Korean thrillers, I was actually surprised that the little girl survived at the end. With every other genre out there, that's basically a given, but here I'd actually gotten caught up in the film and expected her to either be dead or wander up to the guy eye-less and bleeding from the sockets or something. \n\nAnyway hopefully that sort of rant/ramble questions about korean film is OK here.

The biggest issue people have is with the third act, particularly the end fight. I personally didn't mind the end fight. I saw what the filmmakers were trying to do, but I can understand the complaints.\n\nHowever, what I do mind is what I'm calling \"clickbait syndrome.\" Clickbait syndrome is identified by its two main symptoms: treating an opinion as a fact, and not offering any middle ground. If you've seen YouTube videos about The Force Awakens, [you know exactly what I mean](https://youtu.be/36lEg63hpL0?t=1m4s).\n\nSome people can't just say they didn't like a movie, or that a movie is flawed, but enjoyable (because making a movie that everyone can agree is completely flawless in every way is *so* easy). No, if a movie doesn't meet a person's impossibly specific expectations, then it's the worst movie ever made.\n\nBut as I said, I can understand if someone says they just didn't like the movie or they just didn't like the end fight, and I will admit there are some things the filmmakers could have done differently. So here's my question:\n\nDoes Wonder Woman's end fight \"ruin\" the rest of the movie, or can the movie as a whole still be considered \"flawed, but enjoyable\"?",

        "text": "I want to point to how *Toy Story*, made in the early 1990s, is in many ways a metaphorical representation of pre\\-millennial optimism and its opponents in the era and country it was made. Most people probably know the basic plot: A young boy named Andy keeps a collection of toys that come to life when he is away. His favorite toy is Woody, a cowboy \\- a fairly obvious symbol of a mythologized American tradition.\n\nWoody is replaced as his favorite toy by the action figure Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut and explorer \\- this was a popular motif in the 1990s, with numerous pop divas and boy bands \\(such as Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys\\) as well as smaller one\\-hit\\-wonder artists from Europe and the Americas using space exploration as a theme.  Buzz, as an astronaut, is a fairly obvious symbol of a *Star Trek*\\-like notion of technological progress, with his role as an explorer representing the prevalent cultural globalization, while also parodying its proponents \\(see his phrase \"there seem to be no signs of intelligent life anywhere\"\\) as elitist know\\-it\\-alls. As Buzz gains popularity in the circle of toys, Woody feels displaced. In this I see Woody as something like a stereotypical \"culture warrior\" who believes that society needs to remain the way they believe it has always been \\(emphasizing the \"cowboy\" archetype over the newer \"astronaut\"\\), and he is skeptical as well as jealous of Buzz Lightyear, who seems \\- to Woody \\- to be a little loopy in his obsession with space, which represents the idea of a world that technology has made more accessible and expansive \\- see also \"cyberspace\", or the world wide web, which became available to members of the public in the 1990s. Buzz Lightyear represents the cosmopolitan and commercialist trends that took hold in the 1990s, reflected in the election of President Clinton in the aftermath of the  '80s Reagan\\-Bush era that was characterized by more\\-than\\-frequent media coverage of threats to perceivably normal, traditional, all\\-American culture. Woody, on the other hand, represents the remnants of that culture who feel that society is moving in the wrong direction by moving further away from mythologized narratives of tradition.\n\nThese two toys battle for the recognition of Andy, who represents the public mood on various abstract issues such as strict tradition vs. the openness of society, and has chosen \\- at least for a time \\- to embrace the latter.",

I mean they're alright, but they aren't really what I like to see in theaters. But I saw Iron Man when I was 13 in theaters, twice, and it was incredible. Like seriously one of the best superhero movies ever made.\n\n\nBut it's because it took major risks to the formula. It wasn't a normal superhero movie, it had a limited focus and felt very dark and realistic. Aspects of Dark Knight Rises seem heavily borrowed. It isn't bogged down with dozens of celebrities and cameos either, like the current MCU. \n\n\nMost importantly, it isn't afraid of being dark as hell. It's about the horror of war, and the US military industrial complex and the issues it causes. But first it makes you bask in the glory of Tony's new guided missile system, and make you feel like he is God. Then he gets captured and tortured and forced to make Iron Man. It feels more like something that could actually happen than every other MCU, like the Dark Knight. \n\n\nI think another factor is that there were so few superhero movies, that they could be a lot more grounded and not about space aliens. Now they all have to one up each other.\n\n\nBut I can't help but feel like everything Disney makes is weirdly \"sanitized\". The Star Wars movies, the MCU. It feels made for a wide market, and like it can't bear to show the \"real\" horror anymore.\n\n\nEven though Iron Man totally did. Fuck Disney.",

        "text": "[https://myfilmera.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/godzilla\\-showa\\-era\\-king\\-of\\-the\\-kaiju/](https://myfilmera.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/godzilla-showa-era-king-of-the-kaiju/)\n\nWarning massive post about my Journey through the first few Godzilla films, planned marathon, and WW2. The link contains the article with all the pics, gifs, and evolution of Godzilla from 1954 to 2014. TY guys for the time.\n\nFirst thing is to explain where I am with the franchise as a whole because I’m pretty new to it. Then I’d like to explore how the first movie and the Americanized version of it could have been made to work together. Finally, I’d like to offer some thoughts on the series so far.\n\nTo establish where I’m at with this franchise, I’d say “new” is a good word even though I do have some exposure. The Matthew Broderick Godzilla was most likely my first entry, and I think I rented Godzilla 2000 back in the day. I know the Broderick Godzilla deviates a bit from the source, but in some ways that is a good thing to keep things fresh. I’m actually looking forward to seeing it again after watching more of the inspiration. It will be interesting to see how older me feels about it. Godzilla 2000 I don’t even remember.\n\nLast year I watched Godzilla vs Megalon and Shin Godzilla. Godzilla vs Megalon was a bit too campy for me. The one thing I did glean from it, was that the idea for the Power Rangers is very old. Not to deviate too far, but that series was modern to me in the early 90’s and seeing roots dating back to the 70’s was pretty cool. Shin Godzilla, on the other hand, was an amazing piece of work. I loved how it showed the bureaucracy behind the threat and this could have been any threat from earthquake to a nuclear meltdown, but then we wouldn’t have the glorious breath scenes.\n\nSo I have some pretty random entries into this series but not much other exposure besides pop culture references and maybe, just maybe, caught one on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid. Even with little exposure to the actual films, I have some expectations to the series. Knowing how ideas develop over time, I expected that certain elements of the franchise would take time to bake in such as Godzilla’s breath and adversaries. Surprisingly, right off the bat, we have both. Pretty much all the tropes you’re used to with the name Godzilla are formed in the first two films and that was eye\\-opening for me. Looking ahead, the series really goes off into Kaiju land full force. So as I proceed through this series I’m looking forward to seeing how it grows from here and maybe it doesn’t. With everything already in place I don’t know what else I can expect to see show up. I mean Shin Godzilla from last year really was just a remake of sorts of the original.\n\nSo with fresh eyes and a decent amount of films under my belt, I’ve embarked on the journey through the Showa era of Godzilla. Or more accurately what is available on Filmstruck. See it was there adding these films that got me into this in the first place. I’ve been wanting to watch some old school monster flicks and what perfect timing with the new year. I rang in 2017 with disaster films like The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure so ending 2017 with a new adventure into Godzilla seemed like an awesome idea!\n\nI blindly started off with the original classic followed by Godzilla Raids Again but then something odd came up. According to the almighty Wikipedia, King Kong vs Godzilla was next, but Filmstruck had the American version of the original and Rodan up next. This gave me some pause because I’m new to the franchise and I’m not quite up on all the nuances yet. I thought about skipping the American version but I’m glad I didn’t.\n\nWhat I noticed between the original Godzilla and the American edition of it was that the two films could have worked together very easily. The original version felt a bit sloppy in its editing and storytelling, which I think the American version fixed quite a bit off, but it also chewed up the original story in the process to insert Raymond Burr. See, Raymond Burr plays a reporter on the scene as things unfold. Unfortunately, some scenes were reshot to include him in conversations with the cast of the original. This was actors with their backs turned or faces obscured plus some dubbing to make it ‘Americanized.\n\nUnfortunately, the American audience isn’t keen on subtitles, which younger me can relate to, so Burr has a voice\\-over explaining what is going on. I’m ok with that part because I feel it adds to the reporter angle. What I thought was a bad idea was trying to have Burr interact with the original Japanese cast. I think that altered the story too much to shoehorn him into everything. A better approach for the American version would have been to insert Burr into the story at strategic points but not change the story to make him the lead.\n\nHow this would have gone down in 1950’s America I can only guess. We’re only a decade past the end of WW2 at this point, and those wounds are fresh on both sides. Speaking of that, when I think WW2 and the 50’s, I feel like I’m speaking about two different centuries but they were really not that far off and getting a Japanese film like this into American theaters must have been an interesting prospect. On the opposite end of that spectrum is that this really wasn’t that far off of Japan being bombed, so their wounds with the H\\-Bomb are very evident in how many times that term is uttered in this film.\n\nSpeaking of H\\-Bomb. Godzilla’s breath is a thing of wonder. This isn’t fired we’re playing with. He basically vomits out this cloud of searing atomic death that incinerates whatever it hits. I thought it would take some time to get his breath in place. You know, stomp around town a bit. No way, he’s barfing like an evil fire extinguisher right in the first movie.\n\nIn a Filmstruck extra, Tadao Sato, who was a film critic when Godzilla originally came out, compared Godzilla to Japan of WW2. Basically saying that the big monster in the movie was the big monster that they were in the war which is a very interesting take by someone who lived through the war and saw the aftermath it caused. You can see how post\\-war Japan embraced this idea of mass destruction with not only Godzilla but his H\\-Bomb breath. In an instant, the idea of the atomic future was seared into a whole nation.\n\nWhich leads me to Godzilla Raids Again\n\nGoing back to my expectations of the series, I thought there was a singular Godzilla. Never in a million years did I expect that the name Godzilla really only refers to a type of monster. I’m used to Jason and Freddy, not just multiple guys named Jason or Freddy. This really does open up the franchise to any number of angles, so I’m curious where this goes. We also get the first adversary for Godzilla to battle.\n\nThis sequel wasn’t nearly as good as the first, and we have a hick, inbred looking Godzilla coming on board, but we get a magnificent creature battle midway through. Unfortunately, once that battle completes we get a long stretch of boring love story force fed to us before a somewhat mediocre ending.\n\nMy next entry to the series is really not part of it that I can tell. I’m talking about Rodan, which I’m intentionally not looking up much before I watch it. I can only surmise that Filmstruck picked this up because Rodan is featured in a future Godzilla film. Whatever the reason, I’m looking forward to watching it.\n\nI would be a bit remiss to mention that certain entries are missing from the Filmstruck Showa era list. Namely, King Kong vs Godzilla as it was supposed to be after Godzilla Raids Again. Looking at the Wikipedia page, it seems Criterion only got the license for certain entries which is fine but kind of sucks to try and watch these in order. I was interested in seeing how it all developed over the years.\n\nTo close this out I’d like to say that so far this series has been a bit unexpected for me. My original thought was that it would take some time for not only Godzilla’s abilities to develop but that the series would also evolve into the monster brawl I think its known for. Most of the entries I’ve watched are singular in their monsters like the Broderick version or Shin Godzilla. Seeing a giant dinosaur battle in the second movie was kind of surprising. For that matter, seeing Godzilla killed in the first entry was shocking too \\(sorry for those who have not seen it\\). Looking forward to what the series has to offer though!",

That would have underlined how the tables have in a sense turned and now she is the one who is pushing the buttons in the relationship. \n\nI‘m just really curious about this moment because whatever she actually did with that letter, I think, is a character defining moment and would tell us a lot about how she felt about the relationship she had with Olivia Cooke‘s character.

        "text": "So after watching The Lobster for a second time a couple of questions for me was why did he pick a lobster and why did his wife leave him. Well he says he loves the ocean and that lobsters are fertile for 100 years. I think he is infertile and this is why his wife leaves him. A few points that support this are:\n\n\\- his reason for being a lobster is fertility\n\n\\- in the scene in the city he mentions how much he loves his wife and how they will have kids. However, he then weirdly adds in if they don't have kids they will still be happy, they will go on amazing vacations, and will love each other. This says to me that perhaps his previous relationship fell apart because he couldn't have kids, they lost the spark, and his wife wasn't ok with it\n\n\\- he seems to reject the idea of the kid that his friend has and kicks her\n\nAnyways, couldn't find anyone else saying this and really think it adds a nice layer to the film. \n\nThoughts?",

Seeing that *Dogtooth* released in 2009 and was up on Filmstruck, it was a no\\-brainer for me to watch this before jumping in on *The Killing of a Sacred Deer*. The film being all in Greek is not the only thing that made this film stand out amongst his later work…\n\n&gt;*Someone told me this was Lanthimos’s most accessible film. Hahahahaha!*\n\nLike this film, that person played a sick twisted joke on me, leaving me thinking, “Wow! This director actually toned it down after his first film.” After watching *The Lobster*, I was ready to delve into more of his work, little did I know *Dogtooth* is the most fucked up film I have watched since *Fat Girl*. I can’t even call this a comedy; it’s just a social experiment to test how long a person can watch this film without turning it off or pausing to vomit. The premise is basically: “what if homeschooling went down the darkest path possible?” The film attempts to present that premise in such a way that the events are plausible in real life. Don’t get me wrong; I appreciate the theme he was going for, and the film–like most of his other work–is a social experiment that makes the viewer question things we take for granted.\n\nI do give Lanthimos credit for the way the film is shot. The film perfectly displays a foreign country in the 80s.\n\n*Dogtooth* raises the question of if our human nature can be tamed. As the film progresses, you watch these three adult children–who have been brainwashed by their parents–awaken their inner human nature and begin to question their upbringing. Some of the most enjoyable moments of the film are when the eldest of the three siblings watch some American classics and begins imitating them. She quotes iconic lines to display her discomfort or affection. It shows that no matter how hard you try to protect your kid from the outside world, they will eventually break away.\n\nFurthermore, violence and lust are not romanticized in this film but served on a cold dish and garnished with dark humor. Luckily, I washed the taste out of my mouth, but I am surprised this was Lanthimos’s big break. I think it is appropriate to say that *Dogtooth* is not my fetish, but hopefully, I will like *The Killing of a Sacred Deer* as much as I adored *The Lobster*. But right now, Lanthimos is 1\\-for\\-2 with me.",

An example of a truly singular vision would be some auteur films. I.E. Lars van trier, P.T.A, etc. An example of a film seemingly made by a committee or with great influence of a studio would be  new age blockbusters like some Marvel and DC films and basically anything made by Disney. \n\nNow I'd just like to say that that of course film is a collaborative medium in which every person on the set from a production assistant to the director have a part in the creation of the film but I'm not really talking about that and more  of the \"who's ideas are we trying to put to film right now\" aspect \n\nI lean more towards the side of a singular vision even if it's bad. Of course there's a balance between the two. I wouldn't want some hack just making what he wanted to make without any thought going into it. However I wouldn't want a group of people trying trying to make a perfect film, because something seems kinda fake about that. What do you think?",

        "text": "Despite negative reviews of  Fugue I am still excited for her new film. Here is my \"The Lure\" review\n\n[https://myfilmera.wordpress.com/2018/03/27/the\\-lure/](https://myfilmera.wordpress.com/2018/03/27/the-lure/)\n\nThe Lure has been on my watch list for almost a year, and after seeing it was on Filmstruck I dropped everything to catch it. I needed to know why such a recent release got the Criterion treatment, and why some are considering it a must see. Before I even begin my review I must say it was well worth the wait.\n\nDirected by **Agnieszka Smoczyńska**, *The Lure* is a Polish film that technically released 2015 but is considered a 2017 release if you live in the United States. Best way to describe this unique film is to imagine if *The Little Mermaid* was about man\\-eating mermaids who were also into goth music. The Lure is not only a horror musical but also a fairy tale about love. The film centers around two mermaids, one representing the little mermaid type perspective of romance and curiosity, and the other representing the horror and animalistic type aspect of the film.\n\nI have to give props to the film for managing to stay unpredictable until the later part of the film. When you think the mermaids are about to kill a group of strangers, turns out they are actually joining their weird band. When you think you are getting a normal shopping trip, you are actually ending up with the biggest musical number in the film. The film earns additional credits for using the visual effects in a great way; the mermaid tails and gore look natural.\n\nEverything about the film slowly gets darker as the story progresses, and the goth aspect of the film completely takes over. The Lure handles the goth changes in a brilliant fashion that overall suits the story. With that being said there are some flaws: some of the scenes only cause confusion to what is actually happening, and other scenes seem to only serve the purpose of a musical number. You can almost tell that some of the plot and focus is lost on providing beautiful visuals instead of depth. The horror aspect is definitely there, and the film is no slouch to violence, but it would have been nice to focus more on that part than the basic romance.\n\nI compare *The Lure* to that of the ancient Greek Sirens. The songs and visuals are so mesmerizing that you probably won’t notice the giant rock, or in this case the flaws of the film till you reach the end.  *The Lure* is an amazing musical film that delivers a refreshing take on *The Little Mermaid* story, but those looking for gore and horror will be left underwhelmed.",
