        "text": "I've been NC for 1.5 years. I don't want my actions or perspective at the moment to be seen as a reflection to anyone else's experiences. NC was important to me. NC is something that someone should do if they are being abused and mistreated. There's no denying that.  \n  \nPersonally, in my situation, I just can't live with myself if I continue on with my NC at this moment. I just can't. Empathy, even for someone who may not deserve it, is just something in my nature. I can't remove that part of me, I just cant. My anger is still justified. My NC is still justified, by all means. However, at this moment, I need some ways to go LC. I contacted my mom today. Many reasons for this. One, she's really motivated to sell our house, and although I've been ignoring her other emails, it seems she's almost at the point where she's going to leave our family home, so all of my things will need to be picked up. She was saying how the cleaners would remove all of our stuff if her children don't pick them up. My memories and my childhood and my things are important to me. I won't be able to live with those being gone. Those are priceless. I should have driven to pick them up some months back. I shouldn't have waited. I just hope that they're all there. If I'm too late and my belongings and my precious things were thrown out, that's just something I can't ever forgive, and the NC might be for real this time. She's been messaging me to pick them up for almost half a year now. However, my NMom forwarded me a text basically saying that her children doesn't care for her. She seems to be really financially unstable now. All my life she has not asked for any money from us. She is asking for money now for mortgage reasons. This is unlike her, you all would just have to take my word for this. I'm not lying. Also, my mom really doesn't have anyone in America except for her children, who have all left her right now. She's alone. All of her family is in her home country. I sort of feel like crying right now. But, although I am 100% justified being angry and NC, it's time for me to take control again.   \n  \n1. I want to pick up my stuff. 2. I want to see if she will be able to treat me as someone who should be treated with respect.   \n  \nThis is a part of the email she sent a week ago.. \n  \n&gt;Happy new year. I have been worried about you. I donot know really what I did to you,  and/or how I offended you so much that for over a year you have refused to call, text, email or pick up my calls. Does it have to do with my telling you....\n&gt;Also, you donot communicate with your siblings. Did they offend you also.\n&gt;Could you please, let me know what it is? At least email to say just that you are fine /and/or where you are.\n&gt;When are you going to forgive and let go? And if no know is sure of what is the problem , how can one know how to apologize to you?    \n&gt;Could you please forgive me, us ?\n  \nMom never asked for forgiveness from me in my entire life. I really need help on how to navigate this. My mom problably doesn't even remember or has gaslighted herself on what made me leave that summer. Her disowning me. Her cruelty. Her sabotage. I left.  \n \n",

I've been bouncing around from place to place, kind of struggling.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking lately about my life, and there are many things that I would like to change, particularly with how I cope and make decisions.\n\nI am a really negative person. When something doesn't go my way, I immediately blame myself, and proceed towards the nearest cliff. I'm aware that's not a rational response, and I feel that it is preventing me from making good decisions.\n\nI want to be able to stay positive most of the time, and to be able  to take the time and think rationally, instead of freezing up. I also experience a ton of anxiety, which can be problematic in social and professional settings.\n\nI was doing really well with all of this stuff until about 6 months ago. I experienced a very severe bout of depression. I'm no longer depressed like that, but I feel like I no longer have the tenacity and will power that I used to. I do have CPTSD, so is it possible that it flared back up? Prior to 6 months ago, I had been in therapy off and on for almost 2 1/2 years.\n\nI'm not sure if this is specific enough, but I am hoping that someone can relate, and perhaps provide some books, or therapeutic methods that helped them. I no longer want to live my life being a negative nancy.",

And yet I still am anticipating that she starts yelling at me like my mother did when dogs do something awful.\n\nThe other day she had a visitor and I freaked out because whenever I heard voices from other rooms at my mother's house it usually meant that I should avoid leaving my room. I was unable to leave my room for couple of hours because of anxiety.\n\nI am sure there are some more examples but these two freak me out the most :( and I don't know what to do with it. I am also contemplating that I will go NC with my mother after being LC and it's depressing.",

        "text": "In your world, either people do what you demand, or they face your verbal tirade of cursing and insults.\nYou behave like an extremely spoiled 4 year old. You are 34 years old - you are emotionally underdeveloped. \n\n\nYou are a pathetic existence, you don’t provide any benefit to anyone around you, all you do is take from everyone you can.\n\n\nYou are an extremely spoiled, selfish and entitled person. You believe you are within your right to be a burden to everyone, you think everyone owes you and is obligated to take care of you because you are miserable. You are the only one keeping yourself miserable. Much to your refusal to believe this but, your \"chemical sensitivities\" are the result of a mental illness. I suspect you have a slew of mental illnesses ranging from OCD to Bipolar disorder and potentially some others as well. In addition, you are extremely selfish and entitled.\n\n\nNobody owes you a damn thing - nobody is obligated to house you and support you, especially not elderly grandparents, and ESPECIALLY not when you enforce unreasonable house rules onto them and anyone else within your vicinity.\n\n\nOur grandparents experience a lot of difficulty because of you staying there and they are unable to rest in their old age, with you staying in their small 1 bedroom apartment due to how unreasonable your demands are. (No perfume spraying, no usage of household cleaning supplies, no microwave use, no shower gels/shampoos, no opening the windows, etc etc etc - just a few of the unreasonable requests you impose on them and everyone that happens to be near you).\n\n\nYou think because you suffer from your ''chemically triggered illnesses\" that means everyone must do whatever you want. The only illnesses you suffer from are mental ones. You have created illusions of physical symptoms, that only exist inside your head. The only problem you have is that you are a mental case.\n\n\nYou are untrusting of doctors and medicine. You believe in homeopathic bullshit. You are like a hypochondriac who thinks she is triggered by chemicals in the air, except since you are untrusting of doctors, you diagnose yourself as having \"chemical sensitivities\". You start believing you have any and all symptoms ranging from abdominal issues to face swelling, to headache, lethargy, tiredness, inflammation, joint pain, neck pain, back pain, leg pain, nausea, rashes, swollen lymph nodes etc etc etc. In other words, you claim to have every symptom under the sun.\n\n\nI really don't want a relationship with you anymore because quite simply, I'm sick of your shit. I'm sick of you making me feel obligated to do whatever you ask, because I know if I refuse to do what you ask aka demand - I will have to be subjected to verbal abuse by you.\n\n\nOur mother is an enabler and does everything you ask of her (which I suspect is also due to her wanting to avoid your wrath if she denies something you ask for). I also suspect your severe selfishness and entitlement is largely in part to her always doing whatever you wanted growing up.\n\n\nDo you think it's normal to ask our mother to fund your homeopathic bullshit when they cost hundreds of dollars per little vial? You are essentially making her buy you a $300 vial of water every month. She barely pays for rent, but you believe she is obligated to buy you whatever you want, regardless of how unreasonable it is.\n\n\nYou have grown into a useless and lazy human being, unable to take care of yourself financially and relying on our elderly grandparents to provide a roof over your head and financial support from our mother who barely makes ends meet herself. You are 34 years old, and you make yourself into a helpless child.\nBecause of the fact that you are lazy and spoiled, you don't want to do anything for yourself, that's when you ask me to do them. There have been times where I refused to do one of your unreasonable demands and of course you cursed me out, said how horrible I am because I dared to refuse the \"favor\" you asked for. This resulted in us not speaking for months at a time.\n\n\nAll you do is justify yourself and your crappy actions. When the only options you give someone is to either do whatever your demand is (no matter how unreasonable), or to be cursed out by you and verbally attacked - then that is no longer a “favor”. It's a demand, so stop referring to them as \"favors\".\nThis last occurrence of the above is the last time I want to deal with this crap anymore.\n\n\nI will remain civil with you when I see you, but I do not want a relationship with you. I refuse to tolerate being verbally abused for not adhering to your demands like everyone else around you does.",

From my very early childhood, I was very scared of my mom abandoning me.  My dad was (and still is) an emotionally unavailable workaholic, so I didn't have much chance to connect with him.  The weird thing is, I have no memories that explain my fear of abandonment.  I don't remember my mom ever leaving, or threatening to leave, or wishing she could get rid of me, or anything like that.  In fact, I can't remember my mom being abusive at all until I was in my mid-20s.  (At this point, my parents separated and my mom's behavior towards me changed a lot.)  I seem to have the attachment issues that people talk about here, but I don't know what went wrong.  I'm autistic but wasn't diagnosed until my late teens.  But it doesn't really make sense to blame me as an infant for failing to connect with my parent.  \n\nAll I can remember are symptoms, not causes.  I was VERY upset about having a sibling, I guess my parents thought it wasn't normal, and I was sent to therapy.  This made me feel like there was something wrong with me, but I was probably thinking that I would be replaced by my sibling and abandoned.  Also, until recently, I was a major packrat and could never throw anything out.  I don't think my parents understood it (although my mom has the same problem), but it seems obvious to me now that I was trying to create some kind of certainty or lastingness through physical items.  As an adult I became very interested in philosophies that talked about dealing with impermanence, like Stoicism and later, Buddhism.  ",

Gas lighting, yelling, mewling, kvetching. The sweet grandmother in her hospital bed, and her two daughters and THEIR two daughters all milling around, TRYING to pull together and get along and only very occasionally succeeding. But generally failing miserably.\n\nI have the grey rock in my pocket.\n\nI want to give you guys examples and scenarios, but it's like... so muddled. Did my Nmom manipulate the situation, or was it my aunt? All signs point to my aunt... but that's exactly how good an N can be!!! But then why is my aunt acting pissed? And now my other N-cousin (she's 12 years old than me and talks in a shriek) is here - they're just all SO LOUD AND YELL ALL THE TIME JUST ALL THE TIME AND I DONT GET TO TALK BASICALLY UNLESS I WANT TO PLAY THE YELLING GAME TOO.\nI had to say no to staying alone in my grandmother's place with my Nmom, and that didn't go over well. \"You can't say no.\" Actually said that to me.\n\nGrey rock. Grey rock. Grey rock.\n\nNan is in and out, her hip is healing slowly (at 103 we opted not to replace it) and it's just a matter of waiting to see, in terms of whether she'll heal up (she's a tough old goat) and last a year or more, or if she'll take a turn and go downhill.  Every day is different.  Sometimes she's with us, sometimes she just sleeps.  or is yelling in pain.\n\nI'm taking my turns caregiving, sometimes alongside my MOTHER who as I told you I haven't spoken to since Aug 2014.  \n\n My mom and my aunt are pretty much assuming that I'm going to stay and take my place as the third person on rotation as caregiver to Nan.  I don't mind caregiving... if it wasn't for the Greek tragedy factor of everyone (my mom, louise, my cousins, etc) just YELLING every time they're in a room together - I can't take it.  I want to be with Nan but they are just doing the whole gaslighting/lying/manipulating/guilting thing to Make me do it.  And being around my mother is effecting my emotional sobriety. \n\nIt's annoying too, because my cousin (43, teacher) is here in town, but because he has a wife and kids he's treated like a prince who couldn't possibly come and help.  Like, his life is obviously way more important than mine, right?\n\nI'm trying to decide if I should go home to seattle and come back in a few weeks, or if I should stay and do my duty to Nan (who is just the sweetest even in her delirious painful state) and put up with the rest. What do you think?  Nan will be taken care of either way.  But the moments I'm getting with her are wonderful.  But the moments in between are RIDICULOUS.  \n\n(x posted to r/parentlessbychoice) https://www.reddit.com/r/parentlessbychoice/comments/453eq7/xpost_quick_update_3/ ",

(My mother's parents were physically and emotionally abusive to her and my uncle; they are also extreme religious fanatics.)  I don't remember the details of how it started, but in the dream I was telling them how I honestly felt about them, their fucked-up and abusive concept of religion, their horrific childrearing practices, and all sorts of things.  Naturally they were very angry in the dream, and they were making all sorts of threats against me, especially religious threats about how I was going to hell and how God saw me as an abomination and so forth.  But the thing is, *I wasn't scared*.  Their Biblical threats didn't get to me, and I just kept on telling them what I thought, regardless of what they said or how they reacted.\n\nI think that even a year ago, this dream would have turned into a nightmare once they started issuing religious threats, and I would have woken up with a feeling of panic and been triggered for the rest of the day.  But I think it's a big sign of my own development that that didn't happen this time.  When I woke up, I remembered the dream, but I wasn't panicked or anything like that.  In fact, I felt proud of how I'd used my voice and not allowed them to intimidate me.\n\nThe fear of going to hell was indoctrinated into me from birth, and despite leaving their particular perversion of Christianity years ago, I was still afraid in some inner part of myself that there was a God, and that he hated me.  But I don't have that anymore.  I feel secure in my atheism, and in the knowledge that their concept of hell is just another tool that they've constructed to enforce obedience.  (No offense to anyone else's beliefs; I know there are a lot of decent Christians out there.  But for me, rejecting their religion completely was a vital and necessary healing step.)\n\nI am happy with how this dream went, because I used to be terrified of my mother and grandmother, and now I'm not.\n",

I feel like she gives me the 'positive regard' that Pete Walker talks about (I think that's because I'm functional and she has a lot of clients who aren't). So, that's good. On the other hand, I don't think she's going to be able to help me move forwards in terms of attachment - trusting other people and feeling heard. I asked her to explain her objectives and the thinking behind them the other day and she explained a psychoanalytical sort of approach where my doubts and difficulties are 'resistances'. I don't see how a therapist can use that approach and not see me as a problem and this means I'm going to have the same problem with being heard as I've always had. I don't know what to do. You have to persist with relationships, they're not just disposable - throw one aside and pick up another one easily - but on the other hand, you can't force what you need out of them if it's not there. Does anyone have any thoughts, advice or tips?",

        "text": "My grandmother was N in a lot of ways. She abandoned my (eventually N) mother and her brother when they were small children, had a terrible relationship with them through their teens, had a pair of (mutually) abusive marriages and a million instances of self-sabotage, manipulation and vindictiveness. I can recognize that side of her, though I didn't see it much growing up because we lived many hundreds of miles away, and I was her GC. But I didn't know her at all, either. We moved when I was 8. I saw her less than once a year until I was 37. I'm not demonstrative and I don't like phones. (That's a FLEA -- I love email and text because they leave a record, and I grew up with a malignant NF and N/HistrioM, so documentation was always necessary to maintain my reality in the face of their gaslighting.)\n\nWhether my mother's FLEAs turned into full N/Histrio or not is academic at this point. With my mother, I pray she's actually an addict, or bipolar, because that has a treatment modality that sometimes works. She had me in her teens, has lied to me and my (actually adoptive) (N)father about my parentage, abandoned my sibs in their teens, just after I left for college, is a life-long member of the Perpetual Victim's Club, has lied to and manipulated us so many times and on so much that all three of us have grown thick scar tissue. My grandmother did try to take me from my mother when I was an infant -- and neither of them were good parents. I've been LC with NMother for 18 years, mostly of the ghosting sort, because if I'm not there, she can't be bothered unless she needs NSupply or money or both. More often than not, I threw money at her to make her go away, because it was easiest. (My bad, but it worked for years.) NMother has recently drilled her N into a gusher. She's a compulsive shopper and scam magnet herself; she is epically bad with money, and for as long as I can remember, she's always lived paycheck to paycheck and outspent her income by at least 50% each month. She has multiple convictions for mishandling money, from misdemeanor bad checks to one serious embezzlement felony. (Though she's managed to talk herself into well-paying jobs, but they never last long because... She Ns.) Last fall, she stole many thousand dollars from her mother, my grandmother. Her theft required months of planning, significant work and manipulation, and would not have been necessary if she'd asked instead of manipulated. It's that last that broke my structured/LC commitment and reminded me that being NC with her is the only workable strategy. She just cannot be trusted.\n\nGran made me responsible for her end of life care almost a decade ago. I didn't find out until 5 years ago. Because things like that should always be a surprise, right? She's had a series of strokes over the past few years, and she's now to the point where she needs full-time nursing care, not a housekeeper or assisted living. It got bad over the last week. The strokes have been kind, in their way -- the nature of her brain damage has left her gentle, sweet and kind in a way she never was before. I'm thankful I have gotten to see this side of her.\n\nIt's also left her docile and highly suggestible. She got badly scammed twice in the year after her first stroke. The scams didn't have time to take her life's savings, but it was a near thing. The one thing Gran isn't is poor. And with NMother... That's a problem. After the second stroke, I brought her to my home state and took over, per her wishes. (In assisted living -- I am physically not capable of caring for her.) She's probably entered her last year now.\n\nNMother hates that I got the joy of the Depends runs and the messy back taxes. She is jealous of the fact that I can sign the checks, but have to have an audit every year. She doesn't agonize over every decision that has no chance of a good outcome, only one that might prolong my grandmother's suffering, or one that might shorten her quantity of life while improving her day-to-day quality. I have my grandmother's phone records (she uses a cell-based system.) NMother has spent less than 15 minutes on the phone with her mother in the last 5 months. She hasn't visited in a year. She stopped caring when my grandmother ceased to be able to feed NMother's vanity and victim complex because my grandmother couldn't remember and couldn't bail her out.\n\nMy grandmother is vulnerable. My mother is a taker. Thus... When it's a choice of putting my grandmother in harm's way or not, the choice is simple. I wouldn't leave my mother alone with a stack of money, and I won't let a scammer near my grandmother. Gran has about 6 months left. Right now, until NMother returns what she stole (in theory, this is \"in progress\"; I'll believe it when the check clears), she's lost access. \n\nNMother will call me evil and manipulative because that's what Ns do. My sibs know; my sibs agree that NMother lost her right to be informed when she took money she knows is not hers and did so by manipulating friends and members of the family. (How it happened is a long story and complicated by cousins, in-laws and 40 year high school reunions, and isn't actually that relevant.) Her actions have consequences and we've let her get away with not facing those consequences for too long. Sibs and I talk every day about Gran. We're making this decision as a group, backing each other up, and protecting one little old lady. \n\nI suppose there is a subtle blessing in Gran's dementia. She's so gone that she doesn't know what her only remaining child has done. And until the end, she'll have tasty cookies and a warm place and will be clean and well looked after, with no pain. It's all I can do. ",

I feel like this is a more appropriate place for my current situation.\n\nSo a little under a month ago, I packed up, opened a new bank account, left my N's house, and moved in with extended family down in Florida.  It's been an up and down ride since then.  The work has been more steady, and I've had fairly steady income since I got here.  And it's been great to be able to see all my extended family and friends again (who have all been incredibly supportive of me, even if they don't know all the details of my situation).  Not to mention being able to participate in my old hobbies again without anyone to push me away from them this time.  \n\nBut there's still the matter of my father, who is responsible for most of the behavior that led to me coming down here (feel free to go through my history for background, there really isn't a good tl;dr for it all).  But since I left, on the two occasions that we've talked, he's maintained that he doesn't understand my behavior, denies being responsible (or that they even happened, in some cases) for the factors and events that led to my decision to move out, and actively blames me for the state of our relationship.  Part of me wants there to be hope for our relationship in the future, but at the same time, I'm always happier when he's not around.  \n\nNot really sure what the point of this was.  Guess I just needed to put this in writing to maybe make some sense of it.",

        "text": "Sooooooo...\n\nAs some of you know I've been struggling recently (drowning it feels like)\n\nRelationship with my therapist broke down and ended very badly. I feel like I'm still mourning that, and it left me in a very raw and exposed place in the healing process. We removed most of my 'coping mechanisms' and exposed all the underlying pain and hurt, and then poof, no more therapy. I've been feeling like a snail with no shell. My PTSD has gone into overdrive, worse than ever. \n\nI saw my Dr again and asked to try meds (Citalopram). It really calmed me, but it also made my whole body numb, gave me a constant headache, nausea and dizziness, and when I looked at my body it was like it wasn't even mine. I tried that for 3 days and came off it. Dr advised me to talk to work about my anxiety and low mood. (I told Dr I think I have PTSD but he wasn't very interested in that.) \n\nSo when I got back to work after being off sick on the meds, I suggested a meeting with my line manager and head of our team. I explained that I sometimes have flashbacks and they've been particularly bad recently (it was really hard to do) they were very kind and reassuring and suggested they do a referral to Occupational Health for me. I agreed, somewhat reluctantly. \n\nThe next day I read the referral form my manager wrote. Much of it was incorrect, much was highly speculative stating things I had not said, and it was also written in highly stigmatizing language. (And Yes I remember the meeting and I remember what I said and I didn't dissociate during the meeting.)\n\nIt starts by saying \"Pp is a mental health sufferer. Managers were not aware of this until today.\"\nWhat the actual f*^k!?! \nApart from the fact that the statement is completely illogical (you cannot suffer from health!) it's also hugely generalizing and stigmatizing language to use and makes it sound like I've been keeping some kind of dirty secret from them! If I told them I had long term chronic back pain they wouldn't write \"PP is a physical health sufferer\"!\n\nMy manager goes onto say that I have \"long term underlying mental health problems since childhood as a result of a dysfunctional family background.\" \nFirstly, I didn't say a word about my FOO, all I said was that I had traumatic experiences in childhood. So she's simply guessed at that. Secondly, she doesn't have any right to talk about my family background. I've told her what she needs to know for the referral form, she's got no right to guess about my FOO and then put her GUESS in an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT. \nThirdly, 'dysfunctional family background' is a clear winner for Understatement of the Century. \nFourthly, I never said I had long term underlying mental health problems since childhood. I told them I get flashbacks sometimes and I'm going through a difficult patch at the moment and they are worse than usual. What she's written seems like a huge generalization and exaggeration. \n\nLater in the document she's written \"PPs mental health problems have recently worsened this has tied in with a reduction in performance at work\" \nThis is in fact total bullshit. My last appraisal was September and every appraisal I've had in this job has been excellent. During the meeting my managers commented that if I hadn't told them there was a problem they would never have guessed. No one has communicated to me that my performance has dropped. You can't just put something like that in an official documen without speaking with the person first. \nThere was lots more nonsense in there but you get the idea. \n\nThis has fundamentally undermined what little confidence and trust I had left for my manager (some of you may remember recent posts about how ive struggled with her constantly interrupting me) \n\nI don't see how I can continue to work with someone who thinks it's okay to make up shit about me. \n\nI've spoken with the head of our team; who's asked me to make suggestions for changes to the form. Which I've done. She's also suggested a meeting between the 3 of us to talk about solutions to the communication problems me and my manager have had. (Basically she doesn't listen to me, she constantly interrupts and talks over me, she changes her mind all the time, and she doesn't read my emails)\n\nBut right now I'm absolutely livid. I've lost all respect for and confidence in my manager. I made a huge effort to communicate openly and honestly, fearful of stigma. And her response has been at best inadvertently offensive and at worst close-minded, judgemental, and bullying. \n\nI'm dreading going into work tonorrow. How can I be civil to this person? \n\nAlso, I know she's spoken with two other managers I sometimes work with. Since she spoke with them they've been looking at me like I have 3 heads or something! What on earth rubbish has she told them about me?!?!! \n\nArgh! \n/End vent\n\nThoughts and advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n",

Even better - or worse, in the ACON way of things - was I wrote explicity what I would like to work on changing together, what doubts and hopes I saw in the situation, where my biggest boundary was (the boundary was actions not words because words are becoming rare - and conversations not just texts, because texts lack context and I'd already asked him to phone but he kept texting) and that I felt he was crossing these (esp the texting despite multiple requests to call if poss)\n\nIt all seemed very teenager-y because I think that I was about 14 the last time I could be open in a letter without worrying Nparents would open it or rip my room apart to find it \"accidentally\".\n\nBut I took a few days of crying and editing it, but I was pretty proud when I finished it and sent it.\n\nGot a text (sigh) saying he'd read it and he'd reply in more detail.\n\nThat was three weeks ago and even the little bit of communication is completely gone now.\n\nI feel a bit stupid for putting myself out there finally and *poof* I got ghosted. :(\n\nA friend in a private subreddit said well, you tried, and if that's how he wants to play it then you're better off without him and his ignoring reasonable requests.\n\nThen a person whom I've just met from the Marine Corps who is himself a well-known badass, apparently told a few people that he thinks I'm even more badass. Which is a fantastic compliment but it feels really weird.\n\nAnd I got bursaries and invitations for conferences, and a mentor helping me host my own conference. People are like \"wow! Your skills and experience and research are great, come halfway around the world for free to rtalk to us!\". Which is also gratifying if a bit shy/awkward.\n\nSo I have these two outside validations that I'm doing well in my chosen fields. But then I send this important personal letter and *nothing*. \n\nI have no idea what to make of this, the ghosting and that people I barely know are cheering on my work, but the person who matters most to me personally just doesn't give a fuck.\n\nSo mentally I've begun moving on...  but emotionally I'm really stuck between these dichotomies... and depressed he doesn't even think I'm worth an answer :(\nHis sister's ghosting a bit too now so I don't know... how can I be both?",

I was struggling to make a life, and he basically ignored me.  But then I made a mistake.  I started succeeding.  My career is very public.  It became obvious that each of these successes would be met with a lash out of anger.  I made the front page, he suddenly wanted custody completely upended.  I was lauded, he found some long forgotten reason to pull me into small claims court.  Family and friends congratulate me, he tried to create drama with them.\n\nWorse, each attempt to hurt me failed.  Courts saw through his repeated changes of stories.  Violent outbursts towards his son took custody from him permanently, completely outside my control.  Each time he lashed out, he dug himself deeper and only became angrier.\n\nSo, every success I now panic.  I'm interviewing, worried of his revenge.  I almost want to fail, to be the gray rock he forgets about except to gloat about how I failed.  But I keep working forward, pushing for more successes, because that's who I am.  I just hope he doesn't someday escalate until he truly does hurt me.",

        "text": "I’ve been struggling these past couple weeks. I’ve been in this place before and I always forget how dismal and hopeless it feels. It’s the place where I’m completely alone, even if there are physical people around me. It’s the place where everything seems pointless and everything seems to require an inordinate amount of energy. I know I’ll eventually climb out of this place, but it’s hard to remember how to do that right now.\n\nI was doing pretty well for a long time. Life was pretty balanced, I was going to therapy every week and it’s been feeling less stressful. I was pleased with this since I’ve been going for over 1.5 years at this point and it’s only now feeling more manageable/routine. My NC family hasn’t been bothering me, my husband and I have a fun trip planned for the end of this month, and my toddler has been manageable. Life has been going.\n\nAnd then my therapist got the flu. No big deal, right? It’s just missing one week, right? And I told myself I was totally fine with this. In fact, I was so fine with it that I decided to take off the rest of the month (5 weeks) and continue therapy after our trip. I presented the idea to my husband, mostly because I don’t entirely trust myself to make good decisions about therapy stuff, and he agreed it sounded reasonable to take a break. Everyone needs a break, right? I’m understanding now that my tricky part was the part that came forward at that time. I appeared to be completely logical and in my right mind. Now I know that I was actually freaking out from missing that one session.\n\nSee, I have Complex PTSD and, as I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3geofl/complex_ptsd_is_an_attachment_disorder/), it’s an attachment disorder. At least, that’s how mine often presents itself. I’m ashamed to say this, because it feels so incredibly childish and self-centered, but my therapist getting sick triggered a panic reaction in me. After I sneakily cleared it with my husband, I emailed my therapist to say that I was taking time off and see her in a month. She emailed back that I should be cautious and think about this thoroughly, that this might be my PTSD talking and that I might actually be needing extra support right now. She said she would keep my appointment this week if I wanted to come.\n\nI kind of lost my cool when I read her response… Again, I’m so embarrassed by my behavior. I wrote back, somewhat flippantly, that I was “more than just a walking case of PTSD” and not all of my decisions were because of PTSD. I reiterated that I was absolutely not coming in and that I was canceling all future appointments. I know, I’m a total jerk. I think which ever part of me was present got really offended that she wasn’t taking me seriously.\n\nShe responded with calm and kindness, as she always does, and I started to pull my head out of my ass. I began to worry that I’d made a big mistake, that I really should be going in and not taking a whole month off - especially since I freaked out when I missed one week. But I felt like I’d made my decision and so that was that. My Nmom always used to say “You have to lay in the bed you make for yourself.” And so I found myself plunging into that terrible place of self-abandonment. I didn’t like where I was and I didn’t see a way out.\n\nI’m proud of myself that I was able to talk to my husband about this and tell him I was worried I’d made a mistake. (One of my life scripts is that I have to deal with everything by myself. So this was doing something different.) He was wonderfully not judgmental and said it was ok to change my mind, that I should just email her and tell her I did want to come in. I felt ridiculous. In the end I did contact her and, of course, she was like “Great, see you Wednesday.” But, I’m still in this place and I’m super anxious for my session tomorrow because I know I’ve behaved very badly. \n\nMore than that, I’m disheartened by the resurrection of The Big Black Hole. That place that should have been filled by my Nmom caring about me (I don’t even say “loving me” because that just sounds too preposterous) but is now this eternal pit. I understand that no one and nothing can fill this hole. I understand that I am the only one who can provide any kind of comfort to that hole. But it feels so big right now, like it’s taken me over, and nothing else is there. Like no one can ever provide enough love and attention to make it feel better, I don’t really think it’s possible. So perhaps this feeling is what’s brought on the bad place. \n\nAnyway, I don’t think I’m asking for anything, advice if you have any. And thanks a lot for reading.",

Me sweeping the deck is for me, she lives 1500 miles away. I don't have to keep my deck to her standards. Second job -- is there a right answer?

My Nmom would tell me there was a standard and I was not living up to it. But she would set the bar as convenient to her. If she were responsible for it, there either would not be a standard or it would be low -- don't sweep in winter. If she just happened to notice that day and wanted to make it my responsibility, then the standard would be \"always sweep\" or always when not covered in snow. \"Can't you tell it is dirty?\" Likewise dirty dishes in sink, laundry, mowing the lawn, vacuuming, washing cars, or spring cleaning. I can observe her saving some task for tomorrow if SHE is tired. But the explanation when I was tired was, \"it HAS to be done.\" And most of all, she would never admit that it was her preference and to ask nicely. \"Would you please sweep the deck? I would be happier if it were clean.\" DAE have stories to share?",

        "text": "So this is just a bunch of little things on my mind. No crisis (thank god). Just processing :) \n\nSo where to start? I guess with my Grandfather. He has been in and out of the hospital since Christmas and getting worse. My Aunt (aka the only good family member I have) has been keeping me updated. I haven't called my probable N Grandma bc I frankly don't want to deal with her. I'm almost 6 months pregnant and she just stresses me out lately. I think I have emailed her but I can't remember. I send my messages through my Aunt mostly.\n\nSo my Aunt and I were discussing my Grandpa's health and likely turn of events. Everyone but my Nfather and my Ngrandma think this is the end. His quality of life is low, he's not mentally there, and he has just let go. My Aunt told me how my gc/nbrother came down an visited them all a few weeks ago (probably knowing it's the end and wanting to put on a good show) and how they are coming down again over president's day. Part of me feels guilty for not visiting (not like I can physically, emotionally, or financially) or for not even calling. So Ill try and call him tomorrow to at least talk to him one more time. So there is that.\n\nAlso when he was down, my Aunt informs me, my Ngrandma asked my Aunt if my nparents knew about my pregnancy (uh yea, pretty sure Ngrams told them or at the very least their flying monkeys from FB told them) and if my Nbrother knew about my pregnancy (background info: my Nbrother and his BPD wife got pregnant when we did with out first bc we were trying. Our kids are 10 days apart. Surprised I haven't heard about them being pregnant this time. It's coming though! I'm sure!). My Aunt basically told her to buzz off and focus on her husband. \n\nThen my Aunt and I got to talking about my Grandfather's probably turn of events and if/when he dies. I told her that I would not come to the funeral because of my current physical state. She completely agreed with me. She said even if I was earlier along, she would tell me not to come because of the stress. I agreed and said even if I wasn't pregnant I wouldn't go because it would be like walking into a snake's pit. I told her I would at least get my midwife to tell me I can't travel/go so I don't actually have to lie to my nGrandma (which honestly is more for her than me). It was nice that my Aunt supported me 100%. \n\nLastly, my baby shower is coming up in a few months and Ive decided to not invite my NGrandma bc I don't want her to come. I'm ok with a gift (that's been our thing and there have been no strings attached) if she wanted, but I don't want it per say. I really just don't want her to come and stress me out. So I decided a while ago not to invite her. of course now with my grandfather dying, I feel like a horrible person/granddaughter. I really don't want to deal with her shit but I also don't want to add any to her pile if/when her husband of almost 60 years dies. So there's that. :-/",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/43iaxm/realized_my_friend_was_a_narcissist_now_what/",
        "text": "Hello everyone. I'm new here, so I apologize if I'm breaking etiquette, but I felt like I needed to ask for your opinion.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago I realized that a person that I've considered my friend for the last 15 months or so is a textbook example of a narcissist, although to what extent I'm not yet quite sure about. They seem to have a giant ego, but they're also extremely vulnerable to any sort of critique and have a low stress threshold. They sometimes abuse their own body. I'm not sure if the person is completely devoid of empathy, because they are known to be nice to animals and cry at movies, but, then again, who knows. Everyone around here knows they can be a difficult person, but tolerate it.\n\n(If you want to get straight to the point, you might want to skip the next two paragraphs!)\n\nI first met the person through some mutual friends. They're a very vibrant and interesting person, and after the initial attention-bombing I was left hooked. I considered this person a mentor of sorts and valued their opinion over everyone else's. Of course, the person gradually got colder towards me, leaving me wondering what I had done wrong. I started doubting my own opinions and lost my sense of self. I'm not a very strong-willed person to begin with, so I was easy prey.\n\nLast summer, I made a comment about something that they took as a personal insult. They stopped contacting me. Naturally, I was blaming myself for making them angry, but I decided not to contact them again and (sort of) got over it. However, as we have a lot of mutual friends, meeting again at some point was inevitable. After 4 months of radio silence, they started being nice to me again. Of course, gradually they got colder, giving me a small amount of attention from time to time.\n\nThen came the turning point. I'm not getting into too much details, but lately, I had started to wonder why the person seemed to suck all the energy out of me and how I still couldn't stop thinking about their opinion. Then they did something that made me notice that their treatment of me was not completely fair. I sort of got pissed off at them first. Then, for some reason, I googled \"narcissism\" - and surprise... almost everything matched.\n\nBut here's the thing: after realizing they had been a narcissist all along, I was suddenly invulnerable! Suddenly it all made sense. I was right about my opinions all along. I can't begin to describe how refreshing it was to feel like myself again. The person had gone from being a god to being just a sad, pitiful creature in no time. This amazes me too, but now that I know where their insults and praise are coming from, what they say just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm currently in a loving and supportive marriage, which may have prevented me from being sucked in too deep into the narcissistic friendship.\n\nThis happened about two days ago, so it's still a very recent revelation. To be honest, I'm a bit worried about the \"discard\" phase. The narcissist's insults don't matter to me anymore, but I'm sort of slightly worried that if they realize this - should they want to discard me - they might resort to some other means, even physical threats. They can try to turn people against me, but I know there's a limit to what extent they can do that. They don't seem like a violent person, but it's probably not wise to trust a narcissist in that sense either.\n\nI can try to act like nothing has changed, but if what I've read about narcissists is true, there is no way the person is NOT going to realize that I don't value their opinion anymore. I'm pretty bad at acting, too... I also can't really avoid meeting them in the next couple of weeks.\n\nIncidentally, I'm permanently moving to another country in two months. Should I just try to act like nothing has happened until I move away, and let the friendship just sort of fade or dissolve after that? Is that even possible? We're friends on social media, which poses some problems.\n\n(I guess I need to add that there are some things about the narcissist that I truly admire - they are a very skilled, intelligent person after all - and their writings are amusing to read. If all they want from me is some compliments from time to time, I have no problem with that.)\n\nThanks for reading. This might seem like a weird problem, but any opinions and help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEDIT: edited for clarity",

I asked her if she knows where they are because couple of years ago she wanted me to free my room so my brother's girlfriend didn't have to live at dormitory. (Her parents didn't like it, so it didn't happen). She got an anxiety attack and started crying.\n\nI think she is beginning to understand that her kids are leaving her and she will probably end up alone unless she changes. I am in the middle of moving to a neighboring country and my brother studies at the moment in third country.\n\nIt was weird to watch a woman who could cause me anxiety attack by just looking at me experience one.\n\n*****\n\nI am starting to think that she isn't true Narc but just someone who has a lot of FLEAs and doesn't know how to deal with them. :(",

        "text": "So, I'm not sure how to link posts, but my original post isn't far down the line. Short version is my Nmom wanted to send an inappropriate gift, I told her it was inappropriate and that I was taking a break from email communication for a month.\n\nNow, here's how I reconstruct what happened next. Nmom's pattern is to buy extravagant gifts that we don't want. She especially does this right after she has done something really bad to us. I've decided it's her way of proving to herself (and the 'watching' world?) that she really is a stellar person. \n\nSo...what to do, what to do? It turns out the next day she ordered 'Valentine's Day' gifts for at least one of my adult children. (I haven't heard whether she got the others stuff, too, but I'm thinking probably so.) Which is hilarious, because if she felt the need to do this, I'm going to take it as essentially an admission of guilt. Plus, knowing her, she probably did it to hurt me and make me jealous (\"See the nice gifts your children get???\") but I'm not like that. I'm more like, \"My kids get nice stuff--cool!\" Plus, to make it even funnier, the slippers she got my son are too small for him, and he asked if I want them!\n\nIt feels so good to finally be in a place where I can set boundaries, and where I really know that my own relationship with my kids is secure enough that her presents are not going to steal them away from me. That used to be a huge fear of mine and for whatever reason that's gone now.\n\nAlso--the whole Valentine's Day thing. She found out last year that their other grandmother sends cards and a little cash every year, so she of course has to outdo her. Because of the timing, though, I think this year Valentine's Day was just a convenient excuse to buy someone something because that's her pathology.\n\nThe other thing that has changed for me this week is that I watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAxOvgXS-0&amp;feature=youtu.be\nThis is my Nmom **exactly**. It was so helpful to see the behavior from the outside, and the on-screen text is perfect!",

        "text": "I don't know if my Dad is an N or not, but my step-mom is.  Luckily, I had a good mom but at the age of 13 they separated, my mom died (from emotional abuse from my dad I am speculating) and my dad remarried right after my mom died, a month after.  For the past 17 years I have tried to please them both, especially my step-mom but nothing I ever did was good enough.\n\n2 years ago I had a baby and it gave me a sense of confidence in myself so I started asserting myself for the first time.  This resulted in my step-mom, who is a therapist with a master's in social work, to start trying to convince me that I had delusions and that all my \"thoughts\" weren't right.  These thoughts were anything I said about my daughter and my relationship.  My dad supported her.  They both tried to basically convince me that everything I think is \"just an interpretation based on incorrect thinking.\"  Before when I was younger it was just \"you're too sensitive\" when I was offended and I just ignored it.  But this recent thing with trying to diagnose me and shame me for fighting back (because I have been in therapy for years and my therapists and doctors do not agree with her, she has no access to my thinking or my conversations with my therapists) it has just crushed me.  I used to be a very agreeable person but after my family telling me I wasn't interpreting reality right, I have had this desperate need to prove myself and prove that I have reasons for my perspective and that my judgements should be respected.  I'm overasserting myself in a lot of relationships because of it and I'm not being a very likable person.  At work I've lost confidence in my abilities and get panicky when I have a task I'm not sure how to solve.\n\nThis is so different from how I used to be before all this.  I had been out of contact with them for a while and after lots of therapy decided to forgive.  So I moved back home and was met with this psychoanalyzing (without any feedback from my actual doctors).  It was shocking but it made me realize how bad it had been and I hadn't noticed it, I had just internalized that they were right about me being sensitive and that I should doubt my view of things because it's \"just\" an interpretation.  \n\nMy mom died from cancer.  She spent the last two years of her life INCREDIBLY angry at my dad and step mom and obsessed over it and I see a parallel in my behavior now.  She was angry and felt the need to prove herself to him because he is self-righteous and will never admit to a fault or a wrong.  She was so angry and I'm sure that's why the cancer killed her so fast.  I don't want to end up like her.\n\nI don't know how to stop feeling the need to be right about everything and to defend myself.  I'm somewhat argumentative about a lot of things and I have trouble even paying attention to people because I'm planning what I should say next.  \n\nI'm working with a therapist and on anti-depressants so I don't need advice about that.  I'm just looking to relate to others' personal experience with the need to prove oneself after similar emotional abuse.  Thanks.",

I applied for a social services position (those jobs pay really well in my area) but was relieved when I didn't get an interview.  I realized that I probably wouldn't do very well in a job that requires me to be around stressed, unhappy, desperate people all the time - I soak that sort of energy up like a sponge and I just can't handle it long term.  I've come to the reluctant conclusion that it is unlikely that I will be able to work a job - any job - that has consistent high levels of stress, and of course, those are usually the best paying jobs.  \n\nSo I was wondering if any other ACoNs were in a similar situation, or previously in it, and what your thoughts are on the matter - especially if you've somehow managed to make the transition to a better paying secure job that includes moderate to high amounts of stress.",

Because I spent a lot of time in her company since 3 or so, she was my role model and I wanted to start my own company one day too. On the other hand my father wasn't as successful at operating his own business and went bankrupt. \n\nFor some time my mother wasn't able to distinguish between me and my father. Or at least that's what I understand from her \"One Shoji I kicked out of the house and another Shoji grows up there.\" This sentence hurt a lot for two reasons:\n\n* I am a trans woman\n* she would tell me how my father was awful\n\nWhenever I tried to talk to my mother about starting my own small business she would talk me out of it and comparing me to my father. Telling me that I will surely fail because I can't handle stress caused by being in classroom. So I hoped that one day I will do it because I wanted to choose what will cause me stress.\n\nI am neurodivergent, meaning sometimes I can't read (solved) and talk (somewhat successfully working on it; usually after too many phone calls and being around too many people), my sensory issues can cause me hell (public transport can be impossible) and several other things which I can minimize. (AFAIK those of us who are highly intelligent/high functioning [I hate that label] can't get state support, especially if I have only partial diagnosis; I need my mother to get \"fully\" diagnosed)\n\nI wished that instead of talking me out of wanting to become a small business owner, she would teach me how to do bookkeeping and filing taxes. She's a CPA, if I were her I would teach my kids how to do this because knowledge how to read numbers is always useful. If I will ever have kids, they will know this before they leave the house.\n\nFast forward to last month when I was taking an online course on branding/starting business. I didn't want to reveal much about what is it going to be about because my mother who refuses to learn English might find out (paranoia, I know) and might tell me that it is a bad idea and that I should look for employment.\n\nYesterday evening I started looking for a virtual office provider in Estonia (I am only an e-Resident). Today I chose one company and I didn't have a need to be as secretive about what I want to do as I was last month. I was open about my intentions and it felt good.\n\nAnyway this January is an insane month for me and I have gained a lot of confidence because of everything I was able to do or plan.",

        "text": "I think these dreams may be common -anxiety dreams where you are late or need to get somewhere and obstacles keep preventing you from your destination.\n\nI recently had one based on a real teenage scenario years ago. The real part: Once I got into trouble when I was 15, for the next year I was on probation. I had to check in with my probation officer, it was our first meeting and of course my covert Nmother ignored it, never intending to arrange transportation to get there or come with me, we didn't have the internet then I couldn't figure out the couple hour bus ride. So being my mother ignored me in general and doing things for me was such a hassle, she was secretly pleased I had much older friends that could drive me places so she would not have to. I arranged for a \"friend\" who was 30yrs old to take me to probation. I was so easily influenced at the time, I was nervous and the friend suggested we smoke some pot before going. Pot made me anxious, but I did it anyway. I felt so stupid afterwards.\n\nThe dream: I was trying to get to probation, my \"friend\" came by he was running late, then there were so many strange obstacles keeping me from getting to probation and I knew if I was late I'd get in trouble or have to go back to court. As the anxiety and panic was building - I suddenly had a realization. I was a child, I was a minor, it was my parents responsibility to get me to an important appt. I should not have to bear the burden. I do not have a car or dr lic.  If I am late the court will definitely be understanding of my situation and possibly scold my parents - not me. In the dream with this revelation I woke feeling calm and at peace. In the past, the dream would end in the middle of anxiety. So I finally feel like my brain is actually healing. This is the second type of healing dream in the last couple weeks. Hoping this will continue and if anyone feels like sharing their healing dreams that would be nice too.",

In my dream to get away from her I walk away and run into to my two Nsisters who basically tell me what a horrible person I am, I keep walking and end up in a dead end hallway where there is no where to go, I turn around and my husband it there. Then I woke up\n\nI was so upset by this whole thing, He was still here and hadn't left for work, and he hated leaving too because I was so upset and crying. It was awful.\n\nI hate that in my dreams even she can make me feel guilty and hate myself. When I'm awake I know I've nothing to feel guilty about, but in my dreams...well that's just horrible.

        "text": "Hey everybody, looking for advice, and I feel like subs like this would understand the context better. \n\n\nSo my boyfriend's friends live in different states and when they come around they seem to regress to middle school behavior. Sure, whatever. But most of the time I function as a third or fourth wheel while they make fun of him *literally* the entire time. \n\n\nSo, first issue, I have trouble with so much negativity, cause it's less light-hearted ribbing and more turning everything he does or says into a joke at his expense. Okay, vroooomyo, you're being too sensitive, or that's what I tell myself because that's still a common response I have to my own feelings. \n\n\nOver time I learned, though, that before they'd even met me I was given a nickname. Randy. The explanations I've gotten vary, from being because my boyfriend dated another girl with a unisex name/it was some weird kid in elementary school/it's because I'm some \"random\" girl. What? \n\n\nSo that made me feel devalued and like they didn't give a shit about getting to know me anyway, whereas I've always enjoyed getting along with my past boyfriend's friends, the logic being \"they're important to him so they're important to me.\"\n\n\nAt subsequent hangouts I've only enjoyed myself when I've gotten drunk because they still make me so uncomfortable. Independent of my boyfriend they're decent guys, but when they're around each other they team up on him hardcore, and I always feel like I'm just being tolerated. Oh and they still call me Randy when they talk to each other even though I asked my boyfriend to ask them to stop (he did). \n\n\nSo, in general, I get the impression that to them my feelings are a joke, and my preferences are something they'll learn and then ignore and post Randy - themed things on my Facebook wall. \n\n\nI try not to seem like I'm being \"too sensitive\" so I vacillate between trying to play along and being an awkward bitch because I just don't know how to navigate the situation. \n\n\nGood news is I don't have to see these guys often. But we just got invited to one of their weddings, and I don't even want to go. At the same time, I'm telling myself I should just suck it up for my boyfriend's sake, because he'll probably be in the wedding party.\n\n\nAny advice? I just don't know how to handle people that are kinda shitty to me in real life when so many of my responses are ingrained things like invalidating my own feelings.",

        "text": "I mean, I don't know if its the case. Maybe yes or maybe no. But I just imagined what would happen if she does get sick. I don't want that to happen. My Nparent is sometimes very fragile and does not go to the doctor. From how she lives, she does get very agitated and very upset very quickly and things wear on her. Everything. It's always been like that. Her blood pressure was always sort of high. So, I don't want to be wearing on her or affecting her health which I imagine must have been affected by how she framed events my entire life.   \n  \nSo on one hand, I feel that worry when I read that message from my relative. But then on the other hand, the memory when I was 22 and she said \"when you were born, I should have thrown you in the trash.\" It's just something I can't reconcile. She's probably said similar things when I was a kid that I have long forgotten as I don't remember those years. But being conscious and aware due to  finding RBN that summer and hearing her say that, whether she was angry or not, whether this is a sickness of hers or not, I just think back on it and can't imagine someone saying that to their daughter. Like, if I had a daughter, she'd be the light of my world, and when I do have one, she'll know I love and accept her and I will hear her voice. I just can't imagine saying words like that to my unborn kids. So, I think about that moment, and it helps me remember why I'm NC in the first place. That I'm not making it up. That these things did happen.   \n  \nBut what can I do? No matter how I feel about my n parent's treatment of me in her n sickness, I do not want my actions to be driving her even more sick. I sort of wish she just maybe forgets about me. Just pretend I don't exist so she won't feel sick, if she is actually feeling sick. I can't live with myself, if I am a reason of her declining health, and since I don't actually know if she's getting sick or not, it's not a place I want to be in.",

What came next is even more interesting. Sister used to be critical and aware of their games, but gradually she began to engage more and more in their lies and gaslighting, and now, decades later, she has completely rewritten the history. She praises the memory of late enabler dad - whom she used to call bastard - and became mom´s most loyal friend and guardian, at least at the eyes of society - despite I know from other sources their relationship remains sick as always.  I was shocked when I saw she picked a picture of her childhood, snuggling with mom, to her Facebook profile. (Thinking better, I would never find a picture alike because mother never used to touch me unless to beat me...) Of course I´m sure she has financial reasons - keep an eye on mother´s money - but she really seems to believe it. So, what will happen when mother is gone and she finds herself with none to watch her plays? I fear she will maybe try to take \"revenge\" of me in mother´s name... ",

        "text": "My Nmom was very physically abusive to me up until the moment I ran away (literally, she was punching me as I was leaving) and I can't remember ever being held by her as a kid that wasn't creepy or dominating. My dad held me a bit, but he died when I was a kid so that source of physical comfort went out the window. So from 9 onwards, any physical interaction I had was either painful or used to put on a show for other people. Needless to say, I have a problem with being touched and touching others. \n\nFor me, I equate touch with being bad. Just as much as I fear being touched, I fear touching others because touching someone = hurting them. I don't like hugging people because it feels like a breach of their personal space and when I do get hugged, it's to say goodbye. Three seconds of awkward holding and it's done, easy enough to get over. My BF has helped a lot with my touch issues but the thing is now not only do I equate touch with harm, I also now equate it with a sexual relationship. I basically went from \"Touch is bad and hurts everyone\" to \"Touch is bad and now it's inappropriate to touch anyone but my BF\" and it's a problem. \n\nMy BF and I are LDR and it's been six months since I last saw him. I have gone six months without human touch on any level outside of aforementioned goodbye hugs. Despite my problems with touch, I still really crave it and want it which just leaves me frustrated and lonely. I live with my Sister and her husband and I've been trying to work up the courage to sit next to one of them on the couch, but the closest I've gotten is maybe a foot away from them. I was trying to get myself to cuddle with my sister but I don't spend many evenings at home and when I do, I can't manage it. I want to be held by my family, but it's so goddamn hard and it's frustrating. They respect my boundaries with it but I'm trying so hard to push my comfort zone and work on this so I can stop being afraid of touch.\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm wrong to put such importance on being held by family but when you've never had it, it's a kinda big deal. But maybe I'm just a creep who's intruding on personal space, I don't know. What is everyone's view of touch here? Is this an ACoN thing?\n\nAnyway, my BIL and I are really close. He's an ACoN too and we've bonded over that and have helped eachother through some pretty rough things. Well, mostly he's helped *me* through really rough things. He has played a huge part in my recovery and continues to be one of the single most supportive people in my life. Every so often, we have one of our late evening talks that goes until 2-3 in the morning and we had one last night. My sister is out of town but he's been working late all week so I didn't get to spend any time with him until last night. Right now, there's a lot of family squabbling going on and he's kinda being blamed for a lot of shit he didn't do and it's really rough on him so we talked about it for a bit. Eventually we started talking about what our mutual childhoods were like and how it affected our day to day lives (including our sleeping patterns, both he and I wake up at the slightest movement and are up 2-3 times a night) and our relationships with people. I find it very cathartic to talk with him because it's like speaking to an older version of myself and it makes dealing with everything easier. I think he likes mentoring me too, he's really the only one out of my siblings to step up to that role. \n\nAnyway, our conversation turned to touch and why I always was stressed out about it. He'd cleaned up my side shave earlier and remarked that he was surprised I'd let him considering. I told him that I was trying to push things more so it wasn't so scary. I talked to him about why I was so iffy with being touched and it turned into me talking about my memories of being beaten. Which turned into me telling him about the time I came really close to death and left my body for a bit. I told him about how I still miss the place I went to and that when I came back it was the single most devastating moment of my life. He just got kinda quiet and I could tell he was upset and he just kinda muttered \"Well, please don't miss it too much.\" and I told him that I wouldn't. He kinda stood up then and said it was time to go to sleep, but asked if he could get a hug first. I said yes and I was nervous but it went well. I don't want it to sound creepy, but it felt nice. He's the closest thing to a father I'll ever have and that was the first hug I'd gotten from him since moving in a year and a half ago. He kinda started crying a bit and just kept hugging and it was the first time I'd felt safe in my own home. It's weird how hugs do that. \n\nWe eventually said goodnight and went to bed but I was so happy that I immediately skyped my BF and told him about it and he was proud of me. I was proud of me. I feel a lot calmer now and I'm kinda looking forward to my time with both he and my sister a lot more. I think I'm going to try to work on getting a good hug from my sister next. It would mean a lot to her. She has cuddled me before when we've watched movies together but it was a really long time ago and we just stopped doing it after 2-3 times. I know it's pointless to get one from my brother as he just doesn't do that, but maybe I can get one from my SIL. I don't know, my SIL is kinda scaring me at the moment so I'm not going to pursue that right now. \n\nI don't know why I'm writing all of this other than maybe to keep track of my progress. And maybe to encourage others to not give up on being held? Yeah, it's nice to get physical comfort from your partner, but there's also something to be said about being held by someone who doesn't have the same kind of relationship. Like, the hug with my BIL was just pure love and care. I get that from my BF too, but with him it's also sexual. It's inherently different. And it felt different too. \n\nI don't know if I'm making any sense, but bottom line is that being held is actually a really good thing and it's a great experience if you can allow yourself to feel it. I know it's not that easy and it takes a lot of effort, but maybe push to be more open with the people in your life that love you? Friends, FOC, Mentors, pets, whoever means the most to you. It's something that you wont regret or forget. I know I wont.",

Perhaps, I could deal with what I am going to tell you about better, if the stuff with my n-father wasn't going on.  I don't know.  But, this happened 2 days ago and I still feel sick over it.  This will probably be long.  I want to get it all out, so maybe I will stop waking up at 2am with my heart pounding.  \n\nMy 3 year-old son has dangerous food allergies (peanuts/treenuts).  At age 3, my son really isn't great at keeping himself safe.  If a food looks interesting, he will probably try to eat it no matter how many times I have talked to him about talking to mommy before eating food that he finds or anyone gives him.  He's just too little to keep himself safe.  Of course, this causes me no end of anxiety, especially when my son is going to be away from me or my husband.\n\nThere is also a whole lot of stupidness in the world around food allergies.  Some people don't think they exist.  Some people think that I am a hypochondriac trying to be a \"special snowflake\" and using food allergies to create drama.  Some people think that if I just fed my kid more peanuts, he wouldn't be allergic (yeah - that would kill him).  I have been told by stupid people that if I had breastfed my son (I did) or if I had eaten nuts while pregnant (yup - did that every single day, because I was vegetarian) or had eaten nuts while breastfeeding (did that, too) that my son wouldn't have these allergies.  He just came out allergic.  \n\nSo, when someone babysits my son, it is a big deal for me.  It is terrifying.  I have used babysitters less than most other parents I know, because most people make scary mistakes around my son all the time and I just don't want to take the risk.  I have gone out of my way to seek out babysitters who were pediatric nurses or people who had someone with food allergies in their immediate family.  The few people who didn't fit into those categories had to be people we already knew fairly well who took food allergies super seriously and showed that they took food allergies seriously.  \n\nOn Friday night, I let the neighbor kid watch my son and daughter (3 years and 1 year-old).  The kid's mom was there for most of it.  Every thing that happened that night that is freaking me out happened in the 15 minutes his mother left him to get milk.  The babysitter is legally of the age where kids can babysit in my state and he is a good kid, so the mom going out for milk like that was within bounds.  This kid has watched my son before and did good job.  He doesn't have any direct experience with food allergies, but he did listen to my instructions and they would just be next door, so I thought it would be okay.  He went out of his way to make sure there were no nuts where my son could get into them.  I also, would be like 30 feet away the whole time with my phone right beside me and occasionally looking out the window to see how things were going next door.  \n\nI sent my son over there with epi pens, benedryl and his asthma inhaler, because this is all the gear we are supposed to keep with him at all times.  The babysitter had instructions to call 911 if anything went down, because anaphylaxis can progress really quickly and it is important to get help fast.  \n\nMy son spent 1 hour snuggling the family dogs next door.  He started itching.  He started coughing.  He said it was hard to breathe.  The kid is in the middle of changing my daughter's diaper, so he drops everything (baby is now roaming the house naked) and calls 911.  The 911 operator wasn't advising to use the epi yet, but the kid worried that my son was getting worse, so he injected my son with epinephrine and called me as soon as it seemed safe to hang up with the 911 operator.  By the time I get there, my son seems completely normal, but very hyper (as we would expect after being jabbed with epi).  I check my son.  He's good.  So, I get my daughter squared away and we wait for the paramedics.  The paramedics check him out.  He's good.  Of course, the kid babysitter is so upset.  It was terrifying for him.  I am in shock and I dunno terrified.  It terrifies me that my son has to live a life where he is afraid of something that is everywhere (nuts).  Anaphylaxis terrifies me.  And, was anyone keeping an eye on the baby while all this was going on.  She loves chewing on electrical cords and really wants to stick her finger into a power outlet.  \n\nThat the kid didn't listen to the 911 operator really bothers me.  This bothers me because I think what actually happened with my son is that he had a mild allergic reaction to the dog.  Benedryl probably would have fixed it.  But, the kid didn't know my son was allergic to dogs and I hadn't realized how allergic to dogs my son is.  My son had had reactions to dogs before, but that was when he was a baby (kids outgrow these problems sometimes and his problems never manifested as coughing and breathing problems) and he had played with these particular dogs in passing so many times with no problems.  I guess that snuggling the dogs for a full hour is too much.  Fuck.  \n\nIt is also possible that my son was exposed to peanuts as I have just learned that dog food and dog treats often have peanuts in them (I had no idea about this until yesterday).  If a dog had peanut breath and licked my son, that would be enough to put him in danger.  FUCK.  So, who knows.  Maybe the babysitter saved my son from anaphylaxis, but I doubt that this is the case.  Epi pens keep a person with anaphylaxis alive long enough to get to the hospital - they aren't the cure.  I doubt my son would have been in such good shape, if he had truly been exposed to peanuts.\n\nTomorrow, I will contact my son's allergist and tell her all about this to get some help with how to deal with his probably-more-severe-than-we-knew dog allergies.  I suspect the dog triggered an asthmatic episode in my son rather than anaphylaxis.  But, we'll see what the allergist says.\n\nAs an ACoN, I feel like I am drowning under an ocean of guilt.  I feel guilty that I never mentioned that my son may be allergic to dogs.  I feel guilty that I sent my son next door to be babysat.  I feel guilty that I walked in the house and my daughter was toddling around naked.  I feel guilty that I mentioned (very calmly) to the kid and his mother that it is important to listen to the 911 operator.  I feel like the kid had an itchy trigger finger and that bugs me, however, it is better to err on the side of using epi when it is not needed than the opposite problem.  Not using epi soon enough can kill a child.  The babysitter knew that, because I had told him and he acted on my instructions.  So, I feel guilty for not giving him clearer instructions.  I cannot even look at the house next door without feeling a tsnunami of guilt and anger and fear and sickness.  I feel like maybe the neighbors will hate me now and maybe I traumatized their kid with this whole situation.  I feel guilty that I have a serious face that probably scared the kid once I got there terrified for my son.  I feel guilty that I didn't keep my son safe enough.  I feel guilty that he had to go through the terrifying experience of being jabbed with an epi pen.  I feel guilty for not realizing that a child with deadly food allergies might be too much for the neighbor kid to deal with.  I cannot believe I didn't see this before.  \n\nI just feel sick all the time.  I feel like I'm in a panic all the time since this happened.  I keep waking up with my heart racing.  I doubt there is any way I will ever let my kids be babysat by that particular neighbor kid again and there is no way my son is going in their house again.  It is a really nice house, actually, but I am sure it also has a lot of dog fur and dander in it.  Also, some elements of what happened concern me (mostly not listening to the 911 operator and was anyone keeping an eye on the very mischievous baby when this went down?).  Of course, I feel guilty for these boundaries.  \n\nGuilt.  Guilt.  Guilt.  I wish there was a pill to make the guilt go away at least for a little while.  But there's the fear, too.  These kind of food allergies are terrifying, especially when nuts are freaking everywhere.  \n\nI really need to calm down.  Does anyone have any advice on how to calm down?  Even after writing all this, I feel just as scared and guilty as I did before.  Usually posting helps me more than this.  I really need a vacation or something.  :(\n\nIf all this stuff with my father wasn't going on at the same time, I would probably be dealing with the babysitting incident better.  Unfortunately, it is all happening at once and my PTSD is really taking me for a ride.  I really need to calm down.  How do I calm down?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "She lost a lot. The things that happened to her in her life before I was born stunted her growth. She doesn't like herself or love herself. She believes she is disgusting and believes she must project a false self to everyone. When I was a child and looked at her with adoration and treated her like the most wise person of all, she was intoxicated with seeing herself that way. She expects me to keep looking at her in this way, regardless of how she treats me. When she does not see herself reflected back the way she would like to appear, she becomes enraged, vengeful, and bitter. She believes that she is above reproach and feels entitled to be automatically forgiven no matter what she says or does. She has said, \"I want to be revered.\" And she means it. \n\nI love my mother because she is my mother. I know that she can't change. I feel sad for my mother. I feel sad for me because I dulled my own light for many, many years so that she would not feel threatened. It became my life's work to give my mother her own self worth. I was given this role at an early age, before the age of cognizance. I fulfilled this role for three and a half decades at the expense of my own self actualization. I tried many things to try to reach the spirit that is trapped inside of my mother and was hurt by her over and over again for my efforts.  \n\nThere is no one that can save my mother except for her self. I love my mother because she is my mother. But I have stepped away from her because I must do something with my life, and by stepping away, my own sprint is beginning to reawaken. My mother did not tell me it was okay to have my own life. She told me over the years that the things I was planning were wrong, bad, stupid. I have lost a lot. I could have taken my paths and lived many lives but because my spirit was never able to express itself, I could not withstand her rejection of my autonomy. \n\nI need to learn to believe that I am a good person. I need to learn to believe that I am not crazy. I need to learn to believe that I will not always fail. I need to learn to believe that I have a voice that people will want to hear. I need to learn to believe that it is okay to take up space with my body. I need to learn to believe that I can own some things. I need to learn to believe that I have a future. I need to learn to believe that if I work hard enough to believe in my dreams, that good things will happen to me. \n \nI believe I have a life force, a spirit, inside of me. It is as big as a mountain with a voice like a powerful blues song. I believe other people will want to hear my voice. I believe other people will be healed by my love. I believe good things will happen to me. \n\nI can feel sadness but I can't let it climb into bed with me and sit on my chest. I can wish I knew what I know now ten years ago but I can go out now and learn new things and meet new people. I can look at art and hear new music, and eat new food and try new things. I can be patient with myself as a new baby, giving birth to myself. ",

        "text": "tl;dr - After 1.5 years of solid NC with my demonic Nmom, I need to visit my grandma. Nmom is in the way.  \n\nI love all of you!  This subreddit means the world to me.  I hope some of you seasoned NC'ers will give me your sage wisdom.  \n\nI've been NC from my enmeshing addict Nmom since Aug 2014.  Changed my number, moved, etc.  Dead to me.  \n\nI'm 33.  I feel like I've 'gotten sober' from codependency but I'm still not back to functioning - really depressed, not working, isolated, etc.  I don't want to regress.\n\nNow my sweet, lovely, grandmother who I sincerely ADORE has finally, at the age of 103, broken her hip.  We all know what that means.  I can't even talk about it :( :( :(\n\nNmom has flown out there and holed herself up in my grandma's apartment with no signs of leaving.  (well she lost her medical license thanks to all that illegal Rx writing so it's not like she has work to go back to!).  Which I guess is probably good for my grandma (whose sweet-natured personality is her armor), but bad for me if I want to visit.  My skin is crawling at the idea of being in the same room as my mother.  How do I navigate this and keep my NC status?!\n\nI feel like my grandma needs me and there's a dragon coiled around the foot of her building.   And of course my mother is spewing all kinds of hateful nonsense, and drinking at night and wrecking the apartment (source: my aunt).  AAGGGHHH.  \n\nAND I just found out that she has known my address all this time - I moved so that she wouldn't know where I was living, but my aunt told me my mother hired a lawyer who got my address for her.  Cool! Nbd.\n\nMy aunt is out there, and supportive, and she could theoretically get my mom out of the building to guarantee me one afternoon of peace - but if I'm flying all the way out there, and my mom is staying in my grandma's apartment, there's no avoiding it.  SO.  How do I deal?   \n\nThank you so so so so much.  I'm really nervous.",
