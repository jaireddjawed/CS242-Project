However, when the term was used in a problem that I received, there was not even any hypothesis mentioned. Just a sentence without any context explaining what hypothesis or assumption the sentence is supposed to contain. As a result I started considering the possibility that hypothesis falsification has a more specific definition within linguistics. If anyone could confirm this and preferably also link to some source where this definition is described, I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nAlso, the field of linguistics is syntax if that makes a difference. Most problems had a very clear connection to the study material but in this particular instance there was just no context at all which is the reason for the confusion.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm starting to get frustrated by the difference between these two sounds, and I'm starting to wonder how much of this is my own misunderstanding and how much is some sort of underlying universal that removes a contrast between central and back unrounded vowels. The very very few examples I've found which theoretically contrast the two as phonemes (I think I found two in South America) actually have other things in the phonology such that you don't actually get minimal pairs. \n\nFirst issue: many languages seem to use …® in their phonologies, but looking closer you realize that it's an abstraction to avoid less commonly known symbols like …ò, and the language may in fact not even have phonetic …® as a realization. Polish would fit this. \n\nSecond issue: I've seen a lot of descriptions choose a symbol for one place and the description for a different place, such as Romanian using / å/ for a mid central vowel. I've seen similar descriptions in many Southeast Asian languages like Vietnamese and Thai. This appears to be deliberate, not a misunderstanding of symbols, but as far as I can tell it's always left unexplained.\n\nThird: a lot of languages really seem to vary between the two! I was just listening to a South American language, Apurin√£, and it seemed almost random when it was (to my ears) …® and when it was …Ø. Romanian seems to go back and forth but it's more contextually governed. I think the sound is probably in between …® and …Ø? Russian has a ton of realizations, but it seems like …Ø is more frequent than …®? Not sure about Turkish. \n\nFourth: some volunteers use languages with mischaracterized descriptions as prototypes for the ipa, using them on various websites as examples of the sound in question, when I'm not sure it really is. This only muddies the water more. Wikipedia seems to be pretty ok for …Ø, but absolutely not for …® in my opinion. ipachart.com and www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/ also mischaracterize …® and …Ø in my opinion. \n\nFifth: I've never seen proper formant measurements contrasting the two. I've looked, but I hope this is something someone else can say \"check source X, it has a good description and measurements\". \n\nI suspect that there isn't really such, however, or then the generated speech on the websites I mentioned would be more accurate. \n\nNow, the question is what do I perceive as the prototypical IPA symbols? From what I have heard, Romanian s√¢n - s√¢ni would be a good example of back - central. The example I heard from one Romanian sounded like /s…Øn/, /s…®n/, although he said the n was palatalized. I don't have a recording, but I'll try to get one, or if not, maybe a Romanian reader can contribute. \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xnewqczxxij8nv7/Turkish-pain-self.wav?dl=0\n\nThis Turkish example might also fit, where I hear something like  åd í…®,  åd í…®l…Ø, k ∞√¶nd…™. \nThere's a youtube video of Krishna the conlanger who does pretty good with the unrounded central vs back high vowels, even if he doesn't quite get  â.\n\nSo is it nothing other than convention that Turkish is usually described with …Ø and Romanian with …®, but in practice they're both using sounds in between …® and …Ø? \n\nAm I mishearing things? \n\nI welcome any thoughts!",

I'm wondering if any linguists on here can name this phenomenon, and if there's been any publications on it at all.\n\nSpeakers of Indian English seem to emphasize the word \"the\" just before the noun at the end of a sentence. For example, in the video below at 2:04 - 2:08, notice the stress and pause after \"the\" and before \"order of the filter\" and \"cutoff frequency\". \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgrwzMiJpJY&amp;ab\\_channel=MJoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgrwzMiJpJY&amp;ab_channel=MJoe)\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with pausing to think about the following word, since it seems intentional and happens frequently. I'm very curious whether this is a phenomenon that worked its way into Indian English from a similar feature in native Indian languages, or if it arose naturally by chance.",

        "text": "The vast majority of european languages follow the latin script due to the roman empire's expansion. However with there being language families that pre-dated the expansion of latin such as the germanic languages. Do we have any records of different scripts being used of the more ancient forms of these languages, or even if the languages were written down in the first place. A pretty well known example in the north germanic family is the runes used in Norse. But is the any record of other similar systems in place for the west germanic language family or other language families in this region? Or is it even hypothesised that we had no writing system in place prior?\n\nAlso just as an extra to whack on the end for if anyone knows similar for other regions than in europe, due to international colonisation/invasian of countries from the British, French, Spanish, Dutch empires (and more), do we also have any scripts that got replaced due to this such as any non-latin script for the vietnamise language, any native American scripts, scripts for African languages etc? The only other well known example I can think of would be hieroglyphics from ancient egypt.\n\nI'd also be interested in similar impacts that happened with the cyrilic script, persian script, spread of chinese characters across eastern asia and so on since I doubt the replacement of older scripts would be purely latin-centric as such but since it would be a pretty broad area I think limiting to Latin for now might help keep things a bit more candid",

The book has hundreds of pages, so I hope that explains why I didn't put tonnes of effort into strip searching the book.\n\nI often hear these two sounds the most for y/ll sounds (such as in words llamar, ayuno) in Spanish, and I'm wondering about the following:\n\n1. What is the geographic distribution of the use of \\[d í\\] versus \\[ ù\\] and vice versa? Like do certain countries use one sound over the other more? I'm wondering is there a pattern to how it is chosen to be used. I've heard multiple people from Spain, Colombia, Puerto Rico, etc. use it, and I've heard just as many not use it as well.\n2. Is there any sort of formality or prestige distinction between \\[d í\\] versus \\[ ù\\]? I was watching a Spanish teaching channel where sometimes the Youtuber will speak casually and then formally. When speaking casually he uses \\[d í\\], but when speaking formally he uses \\[ ù\\], which made me wonder is it a formality distinction as even when he's speaking casually (with more slang and elisions) he is speaking at the same slow pace for non-natives to understand, so I don't think it's an issue of clarity.\n3. Is one of these sounds used more than the other? From personal experience it almost feels like I hear \\[d í\\] more than \\[ ù\\], especially as of late and particularly in music.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/z1y7r9/reevaluating_the_origin_of_austronesian_and/",
        "text": "It has been widely accepted that the island of Formosa, present day Taiwan, is the urheimat and origin of the Austronesian ethnolinguistic group. With this logic, the people in Formosa should be older than those from anywhere else since they are the progenitors. But a recent study of the Philippine waves of migration points out that the Cordilleran-like groups are the least admixed or \"purest\" group of Austronesian, more so than the Formosans which have more Northeast Asian admixture (not referring to the relatively recent Han migrations in the past millennia). Wouldn't this study challenge the \"Out of Taiwan'' hypothesis since shouldn't there also be Northeast Asian admixture present within Cordillerans if all Austronesians descended from Taiwan? The study places the waves of Cordilleran migrations to the Philippines from Southern China at around 8000-6000 BC which would before the Northeast Asians went southwards and mixed with the Austronesian populations in the mainland where Formosans could have later descended from. If indeed that Cordillerans did migrate out of the Southern China area earlier than Formosans, does that mean the people and language of the Cordillerans or the whole Malayo-Polynesian branch, is older than at least some of the Formosan branches? Will the relationships of the Austronesian branches, the reconstruction of the Proto-language, and the ultimate origin of the family be reevaluated and changed?     \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn another discourse, the Austro-Tai macro family is already much accepted as related with only the exact relationships between Austronesian and Kra-Dai remain uncertain and debated. The comparative method shows cognates between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Kra-Dai, however, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian shows more connections with PKD leading to the recommendation that PKD is a daughter branch of PAN, just like PMP. But if PMP is in reality older than the Formosan branches, it could explain why PMP has more connections with PKD than PAN (which I would now assume for this scenario is erroneous as it puts into consideration the branches and languages in Formosa that would now have disputed relationships and age) would have. Based on the study, it would suggest that the ancestor of PMP&amp;PKD moved out of Southern China and maybe into Southeast Asia, with PMP leaving for Maritime SEA (maybe even some parts of Taiwan as well) and PKD staying in Mainland SEA, where eventually PKD becomes heavily influenced and seemingly butchered by the Southeast Asian sprachbund. Only later after the Northeast Asians mixed with the Austronesians that stayed in Southern China did the Formosan groups leave for Taiwan. Further evidence to this is PMP&amp;PKD sharing closer-looking cognates of proto-words, like \"manuk\" and \"ijung\", that's not common or absent in modern Formosan languages. The Formosan languages of Atayal and Amis also exhibit dissimilar numerals than the other Formosans, PMP and PKD, which coincides with the theory as Atayal and Amis have NEAsian and Austroasiatic admixtures therefore signalling they are younger and are perhaps already linguistically influenced prior the migration to Taiwan. The Kra-Dai words for agriculture are mostly borrowed from the Austroasiatic family while Formosans are speculated to have already been farmers when they came to Taiwan, which all aligns with the study mentioning Cordillerans left Southern China before commencement of agriculture, that explains the lack of shared agricultural words between the older PMP&amp;PKD branches that the younger Formosan branches have as they could have adopted agriculture from Northeast Asians.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main takeaway would be that Austro-Tai did not originate in Taiwan but somewhere in Southern China, and this I think would support the sister relationship rather than the mother-daughter one that proposes PMP &amp; PKD come from Taiwan. However, all the implications that I have raised are reliant on the evidence from the recent study that indicating Cordillerans being less mixed and older, thus I assume also carry with them an older language. What are the strengths and flaws of genetic backing when it comes to language tracing? Is the correlation between linguistics and genetics strong? Did the Cordillerans spoke PMP since their arrival in Maritime SEA or could the Cordillerans have adopted PMP language later on from an emigrating group from Taiwan? Is the study even sufficient enough to support all this?\n\nPlease share your thoughts, observations, propositions, doubts, criticisms and point out any errors or inconsistencies of mine.",
