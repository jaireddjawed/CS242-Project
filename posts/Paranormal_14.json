        "text": "This very truly happened, to me, with my young son present. Even thinking about it feels like something I shouldn’t do, raises the hair on my neck, but I want to know if others have similar experiences. \n   When I was 21, I had a young son and was pregnant with another. I wanted to come home to Texas and my very elderly uncle had an old house in Newton, tx that I could fix up and stay in for free. It was one of the oldest houses in town, across from the funeral home, and fallen into disrepair. I mean, built in the 1890’s. I put so much work in, ran new plumbing, gas lines, cleaned. It had tall ceilings, beautiful woodwork. One wing of the house was being used as storage by my uncle so I just closed the door to it. \n   For quite a while nothing happened. My boyfriend was living there with me. He wasn’t a very nice man, we fought all the time and eventually he left. \n   I didn’t have a car, or home phone. Spotty cell service. But it was ok, I has my own space. \n   Then I started hearing things, quiet voices, tapping. I reasoned it by saying I was paranoid and afraid of being in an old house with just my son. The blinds would mysteriously close after I left the room, the door to the laundry which I secured with a slide bolt would open, breakers would flip. Small things. Constant feeling of being watched. Explainable.\nThen one night, my son and I were just going to bed but still awake. Lights off and I closed my eyes. Out of nowhere, there was a blood curdling woman’s scream. It was in the room with us. Sounded directly above us, like someone screaming in my face. We both froze. I could feel my son gripping my arm. I was so afraid that I didn’t breathe, didn’t open my eyes. I always had curiosity about the supernatural before, but in that moment, knowing that there was something very wrong in the room, I did not want to see. We laid there frozen until the sun came up. \n   I stayed because I had nowhere else to go. Once the sun was up it didn’t feel so ominous and I had put so much work into the house. But I called my mother and left for a couple days. \n   The night I came back, I was cooking at the stove, my son standing on a milk crate with me. Next to the kitchen was the dining room, next to that the living room. All in a straight line to the front door, with French doors open between each room. Next to the stove was the laundry room door with the sliding bolt closed. In the laundry there was a door to outside, but I had it boarded over and nailed shut. The lights in the living room went off, I thought it was just a breaker, no big deal. Then quickly following, the lights in the dining room went off, I was starting to get scared. Then the lights in the kitchen went off. The gas stove was still on, so there was low light. As the lights in the kitchen turned off I heard and saw the laundry door swing open and heard a massive loud boom. I grabbed my son and ran for the front door. I didn’t turn the stove off, didn’t think. I ran barefoot through all three dark rooms, out the front door and didn’t stop until I reached an open gas station. I called my family, they picked us up, but I was too afraid to go back into the house for our things. \n  My stepfather walked around the house, when he came to the boarded over door he found it laying in the yard. All of the boards were broken or pushed out from the inside. \n    I never spent another night in that house. My mother and aunt went in to retrieve our things, nobody went into the house alone, and nobody that came that night questioned our story. They believed It and we were all hesitant to talk about it after. \n   The house has since been demolished. I was relieved. But it lives rent free in my head and I think about it all the time. \n   Just to really make it worse, after I left, my cousin moved into the house briefly. He had never had problems with mental illness before, but after, had a psychiatric break that has left him diagnosed as a paranoid pschitzophrenic with religious voices. Not even the same person any more. I have always wondered if the house affected him somehow. But he never said he experienced anything and now I can’t ask. \n       Has anyone else experienced something like this? I mean really. This isn’t a ghost story, it happened. I don’t know what it was. But without a doubt, something was there that did not want my son and I there.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/10te7ms/paranormal_beings_classification_by_potency_level/",
        "text": "So I wrote a liste based of my own experiences, shared stories, observations and researches.\nBut before starting, here's the basics. \nIt seems clear to me that 'Paranormal beings' (namely referred to as Djinns in my culture) that surround us, yet far away, have different degrees of 'Potential'. There are lesser and weaker beings as well as higher and more powerful beings. \nIt is unclear to me what determines the 'potency' of a Paranormal Being (Djinn) and perhaps it is an innate trait to each of them, but these other dimensional beings seem to be influenced by flows of energies, emotions and certain waves. There is also a clear pattern that points out how the 'veil'/'barrier' between our dimension and theirs become significantly thinner during a certain time, between 2:50am and 4:00am approximately. They also seem to prefer darker and more humid environments but not exclusively, as well as places where strong emotions are lingering. \nThere seems to be a connection between the state of self-/consciousness of a Djinn and it's potency. The higher charged in energy they are, the more they seem to be self-/aware and the more likely they are to interact with our dimension/physical reality (Paranormal). While most of these beings seem unfazed/unbothered by our existence and harmless, some sometimes act out of goodwill, and some are harmful and evil. \n\nBut regardless of their motives and inclinations, here's a self-made classification list based on their levels of potency and what paranormal influence they would be able to achieve.\nThese aren't exclusive to each other and not all that is listed needs to be observed, it is but a scale of what is observable. The higher the level goes, the more 'violently' the previous levels' signs may also be observed.\n\n\n\nLevel 0 (irrelevant) \n-slight feeling of a presence, being watched\n-slight impression that the dark feels darker than usual\n-slight change of temperature/humidity density \n\nLevel 1 (harmless) \n-unidentified knockings on doors, walls, ceilings and/or windows\n-unidentified footsteps \n\nLevel 2 (noticeable/annoyance) \n-doors inexplicably open/close\n-lights inexplicably switch on/off\n-uncomfortable nights to frequent nightmares\n-irregular mood swings, higher sensitivity\n-(rare) whispers, distant voices \n\nLevel 3 (start worrying) \n-objects are sometimes inexplicably moved, pushed\n-'gifts' can sometimes be found in the case of a 'friendly' entity\n-feelings of being touched/brushed (sometimes feels eerily cold, sometimes burning hot) \n-waking up with unexplainable slight bruises or other lesser 'injuries' \n-more complex electronics can be disturbed\n-(rare) voices (from regular to screams and shouting) \n-(rare) fleeting dark shadows/silhouettes \n\nLevel 4 (honestly, look for a new house asap) \n-objects can be much more violently and blatantly moved or thrown away\n-waking up with unexplainable heavier injuries or feeling like someone is choking you\n-pretends to be someone you know and/or that passed away (signs of malice, intelligent enough to manipulate)\n-(rare) visual manifestation (animal/human-like/distorted/half-animal) \n\nLevel 5 (dangerous, what are you still doing there) \n-physical assault (dragged to pushed around) \n-(rare) physical manifestation\n-(very rare) possession (unless extremely powerful demonic entity, would usually require a long exposure to the entity and a weakened mental and physical state) \n\n\n\nThere may be different kinds of paranormal beings out there that most likely have different abilities, but this list/scale should still be relevant enough for whatever you're facing. \nParanormal beings have so many different names (spirits, demons, djinns, sirens, yokais, 'ghosts', you name it) depending on the cultures, but I personally like to think of Djinns as just Djinns, whether they fly, swim, walk, depending on their habitat, or whether they're good, bad or somewhere in between. \n\nNote that deceased people, wherever they go, don't linger around our physical realm anymore. But I do suspect that emotions and memories, or maybe even fragments of time flow differently in the 'other dimension' where the 'paranormal' beings live. Whatever happens, if something poses as a deceased person, IT'S. NOT. THEM. Djinns, although sometimes 'lost' or lacking self-awareness, have their own identities and names. A djinn posing as a deceased human being could either be a confused lesser djinn that shows signs of empathy, maybe out of goodwill to pass on the deceased's past feelings they picked up, or it could be a malicious evil djinn trying to manipulate you with these informations. So be careful. \n\nPlease also note that much younger kids still retain a higher sensibility to 'otherwordly' matters, so them acting out of character or pointing out to 'seemingly' invisible things is not necessarily something to worry about, unless things start getting out of hands.\n\nAlso remember that the fact of simply discussing and thinking about the 'Invisible' and whatever is beyond, makes us unconsciously connecting to it and therefore slightly weaken the veil between our realities. Trying to reach out to their side, with whatever means (ouija, rituals etc) would obviously affect the barrier even more and might be extremely dangerous. And according to certain cultures, some everyday acts such as displays of strong emotions in humid places, whistling and probably more, might also weaken the veil that separates us from these entities. \n\nI'm unsure what kind of audience this will reach but feel free to educate me, add to the list, argue if you have different thoughts and opinions 💕💕 Much love to all, and stay safe out there",

        "text": "Well, ghosts or visions were likely constant but my naïveté prevented me from recognizing things. Things like folks asking who i was speaking to. I just assumed they were under an inattentive spell. As a child images would come to me like a train, one behind the other, as i tried to sleep. I don't know why i felt such fear as they slithered across the darkness like a fragmented snake. Some images would be of those books with giant front wheels, victorian dresses, skulls. Things like that. It was like i was uploading memories of knowledge. \nOnce i woke up to a dazzling lady of light kneeling over me, analyzing me. The events continued after i met my current partner who has a natural gift of sight and communication. She only uses it when she's upset or is trying to find out if I'm lying to her. But her presence, among with mind, has amplified the activity to a bear nightly thing. According to her, though, once i have fallen asleep or have left the house (or am not paying attention).\n\nThe UFOs were a sporadic occurrence. Once, when i was a toddler, many danced in the sky over a mountain named Mount of the Star in Mexico City. Further north i would see them, too. Honestly, i never felt alone. Which was fine because i trusted them. I still trust them. Only, i never expected to actually meet one.\n\nI had turned 18 or was turning 18, and they decided to drop by. \n\nI was in bed, lovesick and reading old messages, when i began feeling drowsy (my lady and myself have often found that we are often forced to sleep when visitations occur). This was before years of experience, so i just fought it, refusing to fall asleep. I wanted to read at least a few texts. The sensation changed.\n\nInstantly, i was sheathed in a blanket of needles, and my flesh was apanic. The screen was a blur but somehow I could see the outlines of the walls of the house i was in. I could feel someone entering the front doors. The way i felt is perfectly visualized by a magnet dipped in metallic dust. It felt like shards of fear jabbing me, all over me, and the closer it came the more they stung. I could see it on the other side of the door. And even though the door was closed and the room was blackness, i could see it turning the doorknob. I panicked, tried to turn my phone around to shine a light, but was losing control and the phone closed shut. Hastily, i pressed as many buttons as i could to trigger the light. My buddy felt so heavy and it took everything to shift my thumb. I swear I'm certain i pressed a button or two, but no light shone, and i collapsed onto the bed, heavy and immobile. My eyes shut, i was falling through darkness, and suspended in nothing, i was electrocuted. At least, that's how it felt. And when i tried to force my flesh to move, the pain increased drastically. Eventually, I accepted the pain and entered a serene state. The pain subsided and i opened my eyes. What a terrible dream! Except...\n\nI turned to sit up, and there, just beside the bed, not even two feet from my nose was an extraterrestrial staring at me like one of those garden gnomes. I can't say why i didn't scream, jump, or even fear. I just stared. It tilted its head and smiled meekly. I ponder this day the meaning of that smile. It retreated and disappeared in the darkness. Instantly, reality set in, and i hugged the wall frantically for the light switch.\n\nSince, I've trained on reconnecting with them, instead of running away. We have developed a rather distant teacher-student dynamic. I haven't seen them since, but my lady has. Though, when it comes to ghosts, i never believed they existed until my lady came into my life. Many teachings are taught in an ethereal state. \n\nAny questions, please ask.",

When my mom moved in she could sense the negative energy that was in the house so she hired a house healer (i don't know if this is the correct word because english is my second language please correct me in the comments). So the healer told her the spots in the house that should be cleaned out for example the attic etc. We didn't pay much attention to that even though we experienced weird stuff all my life. I always had vivid dreams, dreams that repeated themselves exactly the same, dreams of women at different places at my house staring at me etc. One dream i had scared me the most, my room is on the second floor, theres a hallway, a door and then the stairs. So the dream starts with me sitting in my room and my mom calls for me so i go downstairs on the first floor where she was, but while i'm going down the stairs my mom's voice calls me from upstairs and says ,,don't go downstairs i'm upstairs i'm right here'' and as i look up by the door a hand with the ugliest dirtiest long nails i've ever seen comes out and i just woke up, but shortly after that is when i started to experience this in real life. Multiple times i hear my mom's voice calling me while i'm sitting in my room and i run downstairs and she says i didn't call you. Even after this i was a bit of a sceptic about the paranormal stuff, but one experience made me change my mind. \nOne night my mom ran to the store to buy something and i stayed at home with my dad. The store is very close to home so it takes about 15 minutes to buy something and come back, but this time it took longer. So my dad and i are sitting watching tv and my mom calls me to ask me what i wanted from the store because i asked her before to buy me something, and not even 5 minutes later i hear my mom coming up the stairs, grocery bags making noise and her calling for the cats to feed them, i thought to myself ,,there is no way she got home that fast you're tired take a nap or something'', until my dad said ,,come on go help your mom with the bags can't you hear she is coming'', so i go outside and guess what my mom isn't here, i go to the main entrance to check if her car is there and it wasn't there. After that i still hear my mom's voice occasionally calling for me, i also sometimes have a weird feeling when im sitting in my room, and multiple times i have felt something tugging my blanket while im sleeping ( i don't sleep with the cats in my room because they wake me up at night).",

        "text": "Let me start by saying this: I have been able to sense spirits/entities or the energy of people living since was 6. Even had my late great-grandfather who I had no way of knowing what he looked like or who he was because he did tragically at work… and no one in my family likes to talk about it. (Learned after this incident as to why as my grandmother told me on the one rare occasion) present himself to me in a semi physical form and 3 days later my grandmother found his wedding band that had been missed place for 15 years. \n\n\nSo I recently moved in with my fiancé and his family. I’ve been living here for 3 months now and just in past two weeks there have been weird things happening. It’s an older farm house and im not to sure if someone has died here or not. The house it’s self doesn’t have much of a creepy feel to it, it’s just a less modern home so it’s kind of a site for sore eyes. (Which I don’t mind, i like older/thrifted/antique things, they have history) it first started with me waking in the middle of the night to get some water. Everyone was sleeping so the lights where off (conserving energy) i made my way down a flight of steps and to the kitchen with my flash light on my phone. nothing out of the ordinary. As I’m going back up, I get about half way on the stairs and feel like something was watching me from behind. I was so terrified i didn’t want to walk all the way to the top of the steps because i feared i would see someone appear behind me in the mirror (located at the top of the steps) i tell myself “quit being a little chicken shit”. Squeezed my eyes shut and ran up the rest of the way. I accidentally slammed the door so hard I woke up my fiancé. He obviously asked me what the hell was wrong with me as I scared him and looked terrified myself. I told him what happened and in the manliest way possible told me to go back to bed that it was nothing. But i could tell he seemed weirded out by my story too. Since then I’ve heard noises in the middle of the night like someone is in the basement or the kitchen and no one else living here gets up in the middle of the night unless they go to the bathroom. Which is a completely different noise then someone rummaging around in the basement or the kitchen. Progress to earlier this week it’s only me, my sister in-law and her daughter home. We all agree to go out on a Walmart excursion. I lock my dog in his kennel on the top floor. They tire their dog up outside (it was a warmer day and both dogs cannot be out together they cause mischief) when we return the basement is destroyed. There was stuff literally everywhere. We tried to dismiss it by saying maybe an animal got in because the land or came and left the door open. The next morning we’re at the table talking about it again. But this time it clicked in my brain that when we came home the door to the basement was in fact closed. And no one else had been home yet. We were only gone for 2 hours. A few days go by with no activity. Then yesterday my sister in-laws daughter tells me she heard scratching on her wall closets to her bed (which happens to be the one wall that’s closest to the bottom of the stairs). I went to the gym today after putting in a load of laundry and put the second load I was going to do when I got on top of the washing machine (I’ve done this multiple times before and nothing has happened to my basket) when I got home and to change then over to the dryer the basket and dirty clothes where on the floor…. Im honestly starting to think some paranormal stuff is going on here.",

For a long time now I've just ignored it and I wouldn't notice it as much, but now my girlfriend who I've been with since 2019 has told me for the past 2 months she keeps seeing this ash just falling as if it was from the ceiling but float up and down then disappear and lately seeing it from the corner of her eye. What are we seeing? I really tried to think rationally about it but now that she sees it too I'm worried. I've had paranormal things happen most of my life but this is the first time I've had someone else able to say for a fact the seen or hear it too until now.",

I remember there were other adults there as well. \n\nWe lived in rural housing development surrounded by forest and we were outside in the yard (a few acres, of which 3 sides are bordered by trees)\n\nThe older kids were running around the yard and into the side of our yard which was a light forest. \n\nAbout 100 feet into the woods was a small stream of water, and I remember hearing a sweet song. I walked closer, looked deeper into the woods and on the other side of the stream were women in white flowing robes dancing and singing in a white mist. The next thing I remember was one of my parents grabbing my shoulder and the other one calling over keep an eye on him, we turned around back to my yard and everything was fine. Just clicked off. I didn’t really find it unusual or scary. It just was was it was and I never really gave it that much thought again.\n\nCurious as to others thoughts on this experience\n\nIdeas? Are there similar stories / legends? Spirits? Angels?",

        "text": "  Okay, before I start, I’m sorry in advance for any mistakes, I’m not an English native speaker, but I guess this sub might be the best shot I’ve got out here -and I have no real idea where to even start. \n\nI, M(27) grew up and live in a fairly small town in the middle of Germany. My parents bought their dream house in 96, a year after I was born, and moved into it in 97. Everything was fine until the late 2000s (Something around 2007/08) when a salesman for a German grocery store chain knocked on the door, offering to buy every house on the street because said grocery store chain wanted to expand and build a new store in town. This started to lead to an up and down for the next technically 10 years until my father passed away and we were forced to sell the house to the company for far less than expected since my dad ended up making a huge debt to my mother and my name (We forgave him and moved on, he was mentally ill).\n\nMy mother told me today, less than 3 hours ago that the bureaucracy is finally done and that the store is going to demolish every on the street by the beginning of next month. \n\nWhile we talked, she told me about wanting to place a rose down into our old house before it gets demolished, and silly me always kept one spare key because you never knew if you would ever need it again.   \n Anyways, the store or company never replaced the locks and I was able to get back into it for the first time in 5 years to make sure that we could place the rose down.\n\nSo, while I was inside it felt like coming home, but I suddenly felt a cold breeze after a moment, and the smelled the scent of mothballs like someone would walk past me smelling like them.\n\nI haven’t thought a lot about it by this time, but when I ended up walking out the back into the small courtyard and I ended up standing in the middle of a free area, something suddenly touched -and pressed into my shoulder while I wasn’t able to move and breath for a like a second. I was physically not able to do so while I had the feeling I was being watched from the second I entered the house until I walked out.\n\nThe scent of the mothballs also followed me the whole time I was in there, or better while I was on our old ground.\n\nI remembered my mother telling me about smelling mothballs in the house back in the day from time to time as well as feeling the cold breeze in a closed room, and after calling her and talking to her, she mentioned that she believes that there lives a ghost in our house -which is also the reason why she wants to put a rose down.\n\nIf it helps. The house is from the 1600s (1628 afaik), burned partially down in the 1700s, and got rebuilt. We highly believe that there used to be a connection to the church up the hill, but we were never able to actually prove the theory even tho we’ve seen the original plans from the 1600s showing a pair of stairs leading down where our back then living room used to be. \n\nSo yeah, my question is:\n\n\\-Did I encounter a spirit?\n\n\\-and if so, was or is it a good or bad one? \n\n\\-why did it touch me, but never my mother or anyone else?\n\n\\-Did it recognize me after not being there for 5 years?\n\nAnd well, can someone explain to me what happened to me in there?",

My family always had a thirst for adventure, and when they heard there was a supposed haunted house that was about to be torn down, they of course wanted to make a trip of it before it was gone.\n\nThe story went that someone hacked their family to death in this house, but I don’t think that story is relevant to my experience. We drove to the location and what was before me was a house in ruins, it was a two-story home on a very large lot (it even had a large well). The house was just a complete mess. The walls were completely torn down in some rooms, the second floor was opened to the sky, people had graffitied the hell out of it, writing things like “this is the house of the devil” or scribbling their names. Nonsense like that. \n\nWe decided to tour the home, or what was left of it. There really was not much to see on the first floor, walls were down, and we were exposed to the elements, but we all did notice one curious thing. There was a doorway and if you looked in, you could see a spiraling staircase going straight down to a very dark room. We all assumed it was the basement, and we all commented how creepy it was. I even stuck my head through the doorway to look down, I just got a weird feeling and felt scared, I chalk that down to hating dark unfamiliar places lol\n\nMy family decided that we should visit this room last, as it was probably the best part of the whole house, which at that point was just a rundown house.\n\nSo, we all went to the 2nd floor, looked around and finally we went downstairs to check out that creepy spiraling staircase and that basement. Well as you would have it, that doorway was now a solid wall. Nothing was there, as if it didn’t exist at all. The odd part is that we didn’t react, we just sort of accepted that the doorway was gone and here is this solid wall. We searched for that basement, we looked all around and couldn’t find it.\n\nI still think about it till this day and how if we had all gone down those stairs, would we have been trapped down there for all eternity? The odd part is that this is in a country where basements aren’t even common at all, it should not even make sense to have it in your home, yet we saw it.",

My fiance and I watched some scary movies last night so I may be over reacting but the more I think about it, I still think it was odd and kind of freaked me out at the time. Last night around maybe 2am, I woke up and noticed that the fan was going, but like pretty slow. It has been colder here than usual so we have had the fan off and I thought it must be the air flow from the a/c/ heat unit pushing it around. I got up and had some cheese and got back in bed. A few hours later I wake up and am browsing reddit and social media until 6:30. (Not great sleep habits, I know). \n\nI know it was 6:30 because this did freak me out and I checked the time. The light came on. We recently bought an older town home (1950s ish) and there is a switch to turn the light/fan on and off and also pull strings on the ceiling fan. The light just turned on. Idk honestly. I sat there for a few minutes and then reached up and pulled the light pull string to turn it off and it went off. Nothing else happened. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that after the weird thing with the light I just watched the ceiling fan for a while. When the a/c unit kicked on I thought okay lets see if this pushes the fan around like it was moving last night, and it did not. I watched through 2 cycles and it never moved at all. \n\nI just don't know what to make of it. We have 2 dogs and a cat and none of the 3 acted like they felt anything was off. I could ignore the fan moving slowly like that and just chalk it up to the a/c unit maybe working harder for some reason in the middle of the night, but the light turning on? That just doesn't make any sense to me. There was no way for it to just accidentally turn on?\n\nAny input? Not really looking for a solution I guess, it was just kind of unsettling. I always thought the animals would pick up on something if there was something freaky happening. But the cat and the dog that were in the room just looked at me like \"Hey, you're up.\"",

Sadly he was decapitated and died. Had I not turned around, that would've been me in the exact same spot and time. Curious if anyone else has had similar experiences like this? I felt completely fine all day, then something just came over me to stop and turn around...",

        "text": "I get a lot of anxiety thinking about this memory but when I was a little girl, my whole family had finally gotten into the car for a trip to the store. I realized I was going to need my sweatshirt and begged my mom to let me back inside. She unlocked the door and told me to hurry up. I ran through the entire house and ran to the end of the hallway where my room was. I stopped dead in my tracks, not even entering as normal because I felt the energy was shifted. I opened my door and looked up and my desk chair was in the middle of the room spinning and my ceiling fan was spinning in the same exact speed and in unison. I remember my tiny hand on the cold doorknob and the feeling of holding my breathe but that choking feeling in your throat. They both stopped immediately at the same exact time, the chair spinning a tiny bit, gravity adjusting itself. I remember running back through the house like someone was actually after me. I basically threw myself into the car petrified and my mom was saying where’s your sweatshirt and I barley said a word. I assume they thought I couldn’t find one. I remember the whole ride to the store I kept thinking about how that was the one time I actually pushed my chair into my desk before I left. \n\n\nBy the time we got home, I forgot all about it because that’s what’s great about being a kid. I’ve gotten awful vibes from places where the energy is rancid and you feel someone looking even though there’s no one. But never anything like that ever again in that house or anywhere else. \n\nI’d appreciate anyone who might want to share a similar story or your opinion on my experience.",

What are your thoughts?\n\nLike the title says, I’m interested if anyone here has had this experience with paranormal phenomena.\n\nFor example: You notice strange things happening around your home, catching glimpses of shadows or hearing noises noticeable by both you and your partner. Then for a few weeks there’s nothing, no strange happenings, radio silence. Then seemingly out of nowhere you start to notice you are hearing more and more weird noises or seeing those strange glimpses out of your peripheral vision again. The cycle, though sporadic, repeats itself.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI (M22) am going to a college in Ohio. I live in a fraternity house that used to belong to the town (the school buys out properties and houses students in them). My house has been displaying some… interesting… encounters. \n\nLast year (around February or March), one of my housemates and I were talking in the hallway outside of the bathroom. We were there for at least 30 minutes, bathroom was empty, no one went in or out. Then the shower suddenly turned itself on. For context, the shower handle is one that points to the ground when off, and rotates counter clockwise to turn it on. We looked at each other, and went to check it out. The handle was turned 90 degrees counter clockwise. I turned it off, and we resumed our conversation.\n\nLast semester (around September), I was at E-Sports practice. One of my friends had sent me a SnapChat of my room from the outside, asking what I was doing. When I opened the photo, there was a figure standing in my room. This was more concerning considering my room is a single, and I am the only one with a key (outside of skeleton keys kept by campus security).\n\nAt this point, we had assumed it was the spirit of the old man who, conveniently enough, passed away in the room that I’m in.\n\nAt the end of last semester (around early December), my girlfriend (F20) and I were sitting on my bed, talking. We heard a voice outside of my door. Both of our heads snapped in the direction, as it was either a young or female voice, and rest of the house is male. When we asked the others about it, (who were all downstairs, no one was outside my door), they all swear they didn’t hear anything, or do anything.\n\nA few weeks ago, I, my girlfriend, one of my frat brothers, and his girlfriend were in the living room playing Mario Kart when there was a sudden loud bang. We all went to check it out. The shower curtain rod had fallen from its fastened spot. 2 years living there, and it never fell before.\n\nFinally, last night was one of the weirdest. I had heard the same voice from last December, and it was trying to speak to me inside my own head. There was what seemed to be radio interference (best I can describe), as it kept cutting out. It began to imitate sounds outside. I’d hear a car drive by, then a few moments later, hear a distorted version of it in my head. After this went on for a while, it screamed at me, “F***ING LISTEN!!!” (Censored, ofc).\n\nI hadn’t planned on discussing this, hoping it was a dream, until my girlfriend told me she heard a growl this morning, and asked if I had experienced anything.\n\nOur conclusion as of now is that there are 2 spirits in the house. The old man, who is peaceful, and whatever this other thing is. Any assistance on identifying it, or general advice would be welcome. Thank you in advance to everyone’s help!",

        "text": "So my family is full of sensitives. Not like, we walk into your house dripping crystals and saying stuff like \"there is a spirit of a woman here\" we can't tell who, what, when, where, why or anything like that. Can't even tell good or bad. Just that there's something there. Also if we even think your house is haunted we won't go because it's uncomfortable to have to sit there and pretend we don't feel anything. There's no rhyme or reason to who can do it or how we feel it my grandmother feels it in her stomach, mom feels cold wind on her body, my sister doesn't feel anything, and I feel what I can only describe as a vibration where my skull meets my spine. Yes I have called it Spidey sense more than once.\n\nWe also have the habit of knowing stuff we shouldn't, I have vivid memories of playing with my great grandma in a house that collapsed when my mom was 10 and my cousin was one of those children who had the habit of telling people he didn't know, their stillborn babies are happy where they are and don't want them to be sad. Since we usually show signs when we're still little, 3 to 10 years old, we didn't think the newest batch of children would have the gift since none had any of our bad habits. Not even seeming to get uncomfortable when we feel something. \n\nSo far as we know, none of us actually *see* ghosts. Except me and now my nephew. I say so far as we know because the ghost I (think) I saw was very normal. Not see through or blank stare or anything just a woman in a grey sundress with purple flowers that kinda looked like spider lilies but I don't know much about flowers and can only remember they were curved and \"stringy\" but definitely flowers. The only weird thing about her was that her hair was natural which was rare to almost unheard of in the 90s. I had gotten seperated from my grandmother in the store and was having a little kid freak out amplified by the \"there's something here\" feeling. This woman came over to me and said something like \"she's not far\" or \"she's this way\" whatever it was it indicated that she was gonna take me to my grandmother so I went with her, even holding her hand. It wasn't cold but I also don't remember it being warm like a person should be. \n\nI say she's a ghost because when we turn into the isle where my grandmother is, I stop getting the ghost feeling and after taking a few steps towards my grandmother I remember my manners and turn to say thank you to the open air. Even at the time I just think she saw I was reunited and walked away. Well, last week my nephew (now 14) said a woman in a grey dress told him not to take his usual route home. Being in our family, he listened. Turns out, a car ran off the road and plowed into someone's yard on the street he usually takes. My nephew tells us he doesn't know who' she is because he hasn't seen her before or since. When he mentioned the purple flowers I showed him a picture of a spider lilly and asked if they looked like that. \n\nSame woman. Still looks young enough to be a mom and with the same hairstyle and dress. Maybe I saw her when she was alive and now my nephew saw her ghost, maybe we both saw her ghost, and maybe the dress isn't as unique as I think (I have tried to find one online) but I'm gonna assume she's either an ancestor watching over us or some ghost who goes around protecting kids in our city.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. Like right before Covid. I was leaving the house, for background it's a lower level apartment. \n\nOn my way down the steps to the parking lot I noticed a crow under my kitchen window. (the window faces the street) It's eyes were open, it was laying on its side with the wings perfectly tucked. But it was dead. It looked alive. Like it's eyes were looking at me, you know? And it was right under my open kitchen window. I looked all over for evidence on how it could have landed there. It couldn't have fallen off the roof and landed like that, in that place. \n\nIt was like it was placed there.\n\nSince then, weird stuff happens in that location. The most random place, like there is ivy all around that window. It's not a place easy to get to, really. \n\nA few examples: \n\nMy husband took a video of a raccoon, something we never just see out and about in this area. The raccoon was standing in the SAME SPOT as where the crow was found. It was hissing, angry like it had rabies or something. And it was trying to get over the fence onto the deck. \n\nAnother time I opened the sliding glass door and there was a woman and her dog up against my kitchen window, again, same spot, and again she would have to climb through ivy to get there. She saw me and just gave me the creepiest smile I have ever seen. I went back inside but she just stood there, RIGHT THERE, for about 15 minutes before moving on.\n\nI have more examples as well if anyone is interested. \n\nMy question is this:\n\nWhat does a dead crow in this situation mean? I had a friend who saw 7 dead crows on her way to work one day and she later had a miscarriage. Is there a link between finding a dead crow and bad luck?",

The only issue was I was terrified to sleep in my own room- for valid reasons I will go through and share with you below. \n\n\nBecause I was terrified to sleep in my own bedroom, I would sleep in my parents bedroom on the floor on a makeshift bed. One particular evening, I was trying to fall asleep and having a hard time doing so. I decided to shift around my pillows a bit. Moving them around, I noticed a finger- not a normal looking finger mind you- this one looked like it belonged on a corpse. It was pale and purple looking. I looked at it in horror not knowing what to do. While staring at it, it slowly retreated back under the bed. I covered where it was with a pillow and tried my hardest to go to sleep, to no avail. I remember looking under my parents bed and seeing bright yellow glowing eyes one particular day. I thought it might be one of my cats- but it was not one of my cats. This thing was staring me down and I felt uneasy; like I wasn't safe and I wasn't meant to have seen whatever it was doing. \n\n\nWhile living in that house I would hear noises that would sound like plates and glasses breaking in the kitchen. Only to go out and investigate and discover nothing had been broken. I would hear heavy running footsteps up and down the hallway. My sister would regularly see a person hanging from a noose in my parents bedroom from the corner of her eye, then look at it- only to have it disappear moments later. \n\n\nI would see shadow people running around in shadowy areas of the house such as the hallway. My father would have to tell the spirits that lived in that house to go in peace- and we would be ok for maybe a week, then things would go weird again... Amongst many other experiences, these are only a few that I can recollect clearly that really left an impression on me. \n\n\nI think of these experiences I had as a child now as an adult and think that whatever I was experiencing was definitely one that was paranormal. I still am not entirely sure of what to think of what I experienced in that house.",

        "text": "I hope someone reads this whole post, because I’d like some input. I’m just starting to really explore this memory. TYIA.\n\nThis happened in 2017. A friend of mine, who I’ll call Julie, was going on vacation for two weeks and needed a pet sitter for her elderly dog. A mutual friend, let's call him Nathan, offered to stay at Julie's house and pet sit for the first week, and I took the second week. Several odd things happened to me during my week at Julie's house.\n\nThe first odd occurrence was a knocking sound at night in the guest bedroom, where I was sleeping. I would get in bed and as soon as I’d turn off the lamp on the bedside table, a knocking sound would start. It sounded like it was coming from inside the wall at the head of the bed. It wasn't very loud, and it wasn't constant or rhythmic either. The other side of that wall is inside the house, not outside, so it wasn't the wind blowing a tree or shrub against the house. And there wasn't anything on the other side of the wall that could have been moving or rocking to cause the noise. If I turned the bedside lamp on, the noise would stop. If I turned the lamp back off, the noise would start again. The first night I chose to chalk it up to some kind of plumbing noise. I told myself that I didn’t know enough about houses to know all of the things that might cause noises, so I shouldn’t worry about it. I put in earplugs and went to sleep. The next morning, I remembered what had happened so I intentionally spent some time in that room during the day with the bedside lamp on and off to see if the noise would happen again. It didn't. But then that night it started up again as soon as I turned the lamp off. I gave up on that bedroom and slept in the master bedroom instead.\n\nThe second odd occurrence was in the guest bathroom. I was taking a shower and knew that I wanted to put the washcloth I was using in the dirty laundry instead of just rinsing it and hanging it up to use again. So, after I finished washing myself, I wrung out the washcloth, opened up the shower curtain, tossed the washcloth on the bathroom floor right next to the shower, and closed the shower curtain back. I finished up showering and opened the shower curtain all the way to step out of the shower. I expected to see the wadded up washcloth on the floor where I left it, but instead it was neatly laid out flat in the middle of the bathroom rug, at least a foot from where I had tossed it. Something had moved it and neatly spread it out on the rug. It did not land like that when I tossed it out of the shower. It simply did not.\n\nThe third odd occurrence I am tempted to just dismiss as a draft in the house, but I will include it anyway. In the kitchen my friend had one of those upright stand alone paper towel holders. I was standing in the kitchen and suddenly the paper towels started to unravel. This is something I've seen happen in my own house if the paper towel holder is under an air conditioner vent and the air conditioner kicks on. But this was different because there weren't any vents or fans nearby. And instead of the paper towels just gently unraveling a little bit, they unraveled several paper towel's worth (if that makes sense), and with more force.\n\nI was a little spooked at this point, but I couldn't just abandon Julie’s dog, so I basically pushed these odd events to the back of my mind. I experienced a lot of violence as a child, and I think my brain is really good at just filing things away until I am in a safe place somewhere else and can actually think about and process what happened. Does anyone else's brain help them in this way?\n\nNow for the fourth weird occurrence. This happened in the master bedroom, which hadn’t given me any trouble until the second to last night I was there. This bedroom had an overhead ceiling fan light that was controlled by a light switch by the door, and there were lamps on the bedside tables. The ceiling fan light was on and the lamp on my side of the bed was off. I wanted to get into bed and I was too lazy to go turn the lamp on and then walk back to the light switch to turn off the ceiling fan light. There was a direct path from the light switch to the side of the bed I was sleeping on, so I switched off the light switch and walked to the bed in the dark, where I turned on the bedside lamp. The thing is, on my way to the bed something heavy and cold (it felt metallic?) hit me in the middle of my forehead. In the moment I thought I had walked into the pull chain hanging down from the ceiling fan. This has happened to me before in my own house. But when I turned on the bedside lamp and looked back, I saw that there was no pull chain hanging down from the ceiling fan. There was just a very short chain that in no way could have reached my head when I walked under the fan. \n\nThe fifth odd occurrence happened on the final night I was there. I had just laid down in bed in the (now spooky) master bedroom. I wanted to just pass out so the morning would come and I could leave. Suddenly, a loud crashing noise came from the living room. It sounded like someone had stacked a huge pile of furniture in the living room and then pushed it all over. Big loud prolonged crashing. I froze. I wasn't sure what to do, because there was nothing in the living room that could have possibly fallen over and made that kind of sound, yet I definitely heard it. I looked over at my friend's dog, who was sound asleep and didn't seem to have heard a thing. I wondered if maybe the noise had come from outside. Maybe something on the porch had fallen over, or maybe a neighbor had dumped a huge load of recycling into their recycling bin and my brain interpreted it as something else since I was already freaked out from being in that house. Then I worried that someone had broken in. I just laid there for a while, afraid to move. After everything had been quiet for a while I got up and peaked out into the living room. Nothing. It was just as I had left it. Nothing fallen over. Everything neat and tidy. I walked through the entire house and the garage and didn't see anything that could have possibly explained the crashing noise. I didn't want to go outside and creep myself out any further, so I locked myself and the dog in the master bedroom and eventually fell asleep. The next morning, I walked around the outside of the house and didn't see anything that could explain the crashing noise.\n\nWhen I got home, I honestly forgot about my experiences at Julie’s house. I think my brain was just a bit tired and traumatized and pushed everything to the back to be dealt with later. The next time I hung out with Nathan (the person who had pet sat for the first week) everything came back to me and I asked if he had any odd experiences in Julie's house. He hadn't. For the first time I talked about everything that had happened to me at her house, and he was surprised and confused by all of it.\n\nI never pet sat for Julie again. I have been back to her house multiple times, but only during the day for short visits, and nothing odd has ever happened during those visits. I never told her about my odd experiences, because she has to live in that house and I didn't want to scare her. And we are very close, so I know she would have told me about any strange experiences she had. I concluded that something or someone wasn't happy about ME staying in that house. I decided to just let it be and not involve her.\n\nI appreciate anyone who reads this whole thing! Apologies for my lack of writing skill. I'd love to hear any thoughts you all may have, and hear about any experiences like mine, especially experiences similar to the washcloth weirdness and the cold metal thing touching my forehead.",

        "text": "*Disclaimer: sorry for my english, it is not my native language so there may be some mistakes while writing this*\n\nThis story is real, this happened to me when I was a kid. Just remembering this me eyes get full of tears and I start to have goosebumps. \n \nBetween the ages of 5 an 8 years old I used to suffer “night terrors” I thought that it was caused because my parents tend to argue screaming to each other a lot. \nI slept in my room, it is a really small room with only space for a bed, a little desk and a small closet. The room has rectangle shape and there is one item in every corner, in the one who is left it is the door (this will be important for later).\n\nI can remember very clear how every night when I was in my bed trying to sleep some kind whispering in my ear that was increasing its tone until it became a scream. Instead of waking me up this scream started my nightmare. \n\nThe nightmare always starts the same way, I am alone in a huge black field with a black sky and no lights with nothing around me but a small house made of stone bricks with a little window. I always walk inside the house from the front door and get out from the back door. \nWalking out the back door I saw the skyline of tall buildings that looked totally destroyed. After that a huge fireball comes to me with the same whispering. As the fireball gets closer the whisper becomes a scream again. \n\nThis time the scream wakes me up and in front of me inside of my room in the real life there is a woman in the same corner where the closet is, looking at me. This woman seems to be totally wet like she just got out of a storm, her long black hair is covering his face and she wears a loong green coat. \n\nNon of my parents is able to see her when they come after hearing me scream in terror but the woman keeps there looking at me while my mother is hugging me. \n\nThis nightmare has repeated so many days during those years but what gives me goosebumps is how they stopped.\n\nIt was a sunny day of summer, during the morning I was going with my mum to the supermarket to buy. The supermarket is inside the city (european city). My mom stopped by to chat with a friend in the street. I was looking around and just at the other side of the street, separated by one road I was able to see that woman again. I do not remember why but I let go my mother's hand trying to go to that woman. When I was crossing the road a car hit me and I just remember waking up in the hospital with the doctor checking me legs. (I was okay) \n\nAfter this incident I never had night terrors or saw that woman again. \n\n\nI just wanted to share this with you because maybe someone has went through something similar.",

        "text": "If you read my first “encounter” or whatever you want to call it, well this all happened just about 7 km down the road from that.\n\nA few years later I was out hunting with a friend when we lost legal light. So we hiked back to the truck and hit the road in his parents new ford half ton (the ones with the sensors all over the vehicle). We had some music playing as we were just heading back towards town again, when the music started acting weird and cutting in and out with static, so me being in the passenger seat, disconnected the Bluetooth and reconnected the phone. Music cleared up and we continued down the road. We got up to the km board on the road that my previous encounter took place and I mentioned: “oh hey, that’s the whistle block that we logged a couple years back.” Half jokingly because I couldn’t make heads or tales of it. My friend replied: “grrreeeaaaat, thanks for that…” as I had told him the story before.\n\nWe continued slowly driving down the road because it gets pretty rough in a couple spots and the road has a few sharp turns and an S bend. Well we go about a kilometre further and the music starts screeching and doing what we can only describe as alien noises. So I disconnect the Bluetooth again and my friend says: “oh, moms got a cord in here.” So he stops and gets the cord for me, I plug the phone in and play music again.\n\nAnother kilometre down the road and the phone goes ape sh!t. I mean loud alien squealing and sounds similar to that sh!tty dial up Internet noise from the 90’s. We had started into the S bend when this was happening and we shut the music off completely as we are driving still, making the one half of the S turn and then we both look up from the music deck/screen and the headlight illuminate a figure standing in the middle of the road. So we swerve and take the ditch a bit still going probably 30km/h, and get the truck back up on the road. We continue coasting down the road as we are both in awe after just seeing a flash of this thing.. I finally say after what seemed like 5 quiet minutes: “Man did you just see..” my friend cuts me off and says: “a f()ckin skeleton in the middle of the road?!” I say: “Yeah.. like a white rib cage,” “and a deer skull for a face?” He finishes. I said: “turn around, what the f()ck was that? Does someone need our help?” Not thinking that we are in the middle of no where, with no vehicles around or any that we had past from other hunters(it was early season and no one bow hunts here anyways). My friend said: “I’m not turning around, I feel sick. Like I’m going to throw up.” And he continued driving. We didn’t see another vehicle until we hit pavement again.\n\nIt was taller than the pickup by easily a couple feet. (I’m 6’1 and my forehead is at the top of the window for reference) it has black surrounding the white of the bones with long arms half stretched to its sides as if it was saying try and hit me.\n\nI watched this thing pass the passenger window and stared up at it as we wailed by it, and it was definitely 3 dimensional, tall with long arms and dark. Dead looking. Like light was sucked into it without reflecting anything. Hard to explain.\n\nWhen we hit service again my friend received a text message from his mother saying: “what did you two idiots hit in my brand new truck?!”\nI guess the new fords send near accident reports to the owner when the sensors pick up something? I’m an old school chevy guy so I don’t know haha.\n\nThe only thing I can find online that resembles what we both saw is a “wendigo” without the antlers. Or the headlights didn’t illuminate them anyway.",

        "text": "\nI am a logger in northern BC, Canada. I am a avid hunter and have spent many a nights hunting alone. That being said.. Quite a few years ago, I was working on a broken down skidder in the dark after everyone on the logging block was gone, changing a blown hydraulic hose under the cab when I felt like I was being watched. The feeling continued to get worse and worse so I was on edge and continued to work on replacing the blown hose. Every trip for tools to the service truck and back I would scan for eyes in the near by tree line about 25 meters away with my flashlight. Nothing. Continued to work on the pain in the @ss hose that you literally have to dive your head and upper body under the cab to reach and so your legs are stuck up in the air and feeling vulnerable, the feeling of being watched gets more intense, all the hairs on my neck are standing and I hear a two tone whistle from far away. Almost as if it was wind it was so far away but it was flat calm that day, also there was about 6” of fresh snow on the ground. I pushed myself out from under the skidder and looked around quietly with a flashlight for eyes in the tree line and down the road. Nothing. I had one side of the hose fitting to remove still and it was the easier side and higher up so I wasn’t @ss over tea kettle removing it, I put my head back under the cab and quickly began to spin the fitting loose. The feeling of being watched was so bad every hair on my body was standing and then I hear the same two tone whistle very loudly in the tree line directly behind me. I had the hose off at the exact same time so I whipped myself out from under the cab and turned ready to thrown down with a 1 5/8” wrench in my hand, yelling “alright, WHERE THE F()CK ARE YA?!” \nNothing, no one there, no tracks, no eyes, no wind, nothing. The flashlight I had was more of a small flood light for working on repair stuff so it didn’t light up inside the trees.\n\nThe next day it had snowed another 6” or so, but I went and hiked the tree line with a 12 gauge and 7, 3” slugs ready to go. No tracks that I could see, no perches on the trees where snow had been pushed off, if it was a bird. Nothing.\n\nSee the next post for the second incident.",

After a while, we didn't think anything of it. About a week later, we're talking to our neighbors, and we find out they used to live in the trailer we did. The first thing they asked was, \"Have you heard the singing?\". Of course, this was kinda creepy. From this point on, I've always been a believer, at least to an extent. This could have a logical explanation, but I never found one. Comment your stories below.",

        "text": "\n\nMy passion for the paranormal started over twenty years ago. I was just a teenager and  my step dad had died of cancer. I lived in a different state and didn’t get a chance to say goodbye. I went over to my sisters house to watch my nephew. It was his nap time, so I placed him in his crib and walked down the hall to the living room. \n\nFrom the couch I could see him in his room. I was really tired and decided I would take a nap while he was taking one. I was in that half awake state and I kept hearing him jumping up and down in his crib and laughing. I was so tired, but sat up and said, “please go to sleep for auntie”. As I lay my head back down, I was almost asleep and heard a grown man whistling really loud. It was a quick tune, but it was loud. My nephew was staring at something and laughing. \n\nI completely panicked and froze in fear, as I thought someone broke in. I ran down the hall to protect my nephew and there was no one else in the room. I ran outside until a friend could come over. When I made it back in the house and made sure no one was there, I started to explain the details to my friend. I took my nephew back to his room to change his diaper. As I was changing him, he pointed towards his closet door and said “Papa”. He called my step dad papa. This experience brought me so much comfort knowing that our loved ones are still with us after they pass.\n\nFor the many year after the experience, I looked for more. I wanted more validation from more experiences and from the experiences of others. In my early twenties, my husband and I had met a couple through his work that seemed as interested in the paranormal as I was.\n\nOne of the haunted placed in my town was the obvious, a cemetery. The cemetery was right next to an asylum and many other state buildings that had well lit parking lots, My friend and her husband picked me up one night after work to go to this cemetery for our first ghost hunt, as there were many stories about this specific area.\n\nIt was late and as we started through the cemetery path, it felt as if there were spider webs brushing across my face. Not much happened for awhile until we walked to the back towards the mausoleum. There were trees and Ivy with a small dirt hill that had an little path, with nothing more at the end but a chain linked fence. On the other side of the fence was one of the state building with light coming from the parking lot.\n\nMy friend and I noticed what we thought was a security guard walking along the chain link fence on the cemetery side. With the light from the parking lot and the darkness from the cemetery, I couldn’t make out features other than his bulky uniform and hat. He wasn’t facing me and was pointing a flash light towards the \nground swaying it back and forth as if looking for something. \n\nI was at the top of the ivy path, looking down towards him waiting to be busted for being in a cemetery past dusk. He made a abrupt stop, did a military about face maneuver and raised his flash light at us in a mechanical motion. I still saw no features. I knew by the movement it wasn’t a security guard. I never thought when I saw my first ghost it would look so solid and real. I honestly don’t know what else it could have been. \n\nAlthough a little jarring, it is was I was looking for. I will always have a passion for the paranormal, as I know from experience there is so much more out there.",

We talked about how weird it was and I made a pallet on her floor to stay the night in her room because I wasn't sleeping alone.\n\nEventually she fell asleep and I was trying to go to sleep but I saw 3 orbs in her closet all at once. I've never seen orbs before in my life or anything paranormal except for when I was a child. I closed my eyes and hid under my blankets like a kid because I didn't want to see anything else.",

She had informed me in December that her and my cousin (her son, who hasn’t had any paranormal encounters before) have had a dream and chatted with my grandfather (on my moms side), who passed in May of 2022, one week apart, and both woke up around 3 AM.\n\nExactly one week later I think I was visited by him as well. \n\nIn my dream I was at an auditorium, might have been for a basketball game or volleyball. I’m not quite sure because I don’t remember what was being played, but I do remember sitting in the stands. They were the type of stands that can pull out and retract back into the wall, much like a high school gymnasium. \n\nI went to the bathroom and to the stall to take a leak since the urinal was taken. I finished up, opened the door and I saw my grandfather (on my dads side) standing near the exit with a very puzzled look on his face. I tried to call out to him, sternly saying “hey! I need to talk to you!” but he turned and walked out. As soon as the exit door shut I opened it and nobody was there. He physically looked as he did when I was a kid, not the age of which he passed. I felt a bit disgruntled because he didn’t recognize me.. I can only assume it’s the dementia. I went back to wash my hands and exited.\n\nAs I’m walking back toward my seat I notice a bunch of kids turned looking and talking to a man who looks like my grandfather (moms side). Nobody else in the crowd seemed to notice him except the children. As I’m walking up (he’s in the far most top corner) it’s for sure him, I overhear one of the kids asking if he’s an angel. He chuckled and replied “well, I’m not quite sure about that.”\n\nI was happy to see him. He looked like my other grandfather did, younger, healthier, like he looked when I was a child. We talked for a second and he said he had to leave. He started to kind of fade away but I interrupted and asked him if he could stay longer. He again chuckled and said “that’s now quite how this works.” I started tearing up in my dream as he was fading away, and said “feel free to visit any time.” I felt very comfortable around him in my dream. He then nodded, disappeared, and I woke up at roughly 3 AM.\n\nI’m not sure if it was just in the back of my brain because they both had mentioned him visiting or what but it was almost peaceful. I did wake up feeling calm but a few moments later I could feel my heart pounding in my ears, as I’ve never had anything like that happen before.\n\nI just wanted to share my story and ask, has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any input would help. \n\nThanks for the read, I’m not quite sure how this Reddit thing works but I’m going to try to figure it out.",

It was one tone, slightly warbling and came in waves. It came from above my head, almost in the right corner of a wall that is exactly 150 degrees SE. When i looked up, i saw purple waves coming from the ceiling in my minds eye. Only one of my dogs heard it and freaked out! I looked out the window and nothing was there. What could this be? (This is not my first encounter with the paranormal, so I’m confident what I experienced is exactly what happened)",

AND i have a video capture of him, where his left eye is completely black. strangely the camera couldn’t “really” capture the different face even though i saw the face with my own eyes in the same moment i took the video. right after the different eyes and that one black eye, he closed his eyes and moved them around, opened them up and they looked at the camera with normal eyes, looked at me and said “what are you doing bro? ..taking a video of me? ..why?” \n\nas if he knew nothing.. \n\nit’s all in the video and i can show it in private, to the one who may have answers for me.\n\njust one more thing that just popped in my mind: i once asked him why he liked me so much and wanted to spend so much time with me. he said “you truly have a soul and and you’re a truly good person”.\n\nthat’s all thank you",

Standing on a stool to get close to the light with their hands as the lightbulb was on the ceiling. One night they did this and then they all sat down and started getting ready for bed. My grandma then looked up from her bed in horror to see a pair of shadow hands still moving on the ceiling, even though nobody was near the lightbulb. They all saw it and ran out of the room.\n\n\nSame grandma but years later, she would be in her 50s at this point maybe. She came home from a meal with my grandpa (neither drank alcohol) he dropped her at the front door then proceeds to drive the car around the back of the house to park up. My grandma opens the front door and walks into the house. Upon entering she notices a thick fog covering the entire living floor up to knee height. She said you couldn't see anything below this fog and the level of the fog was extremely flat. She ran out to get my grandpa but when she returned it had gone. \n\nHope you enjoyed, love reading everyones stories :)",

        "text": "It all started when I was about five. My parents never had a lot of money, at least a few times a year power was turned off due to failure to pay bills. Since it was such a frequent occurrence; we always kept a big box of candles and tea lights to light the house in the evenings when we didn’t have power. My parents had put me to bed and blown outmost of the candles, with the exception of the ones in their room. I woke up at some point early in the night to go use the bathroom, which was directly across the hall from my room in the trailer.  I pause in the dark hallway and look to my left, through the living room and into my parents room and I see him. The Zebraman. He was roughly my dads height (6’1”) and honestly his appearance haunts my dreams still. He had the, completely nude torso of a human male; but the head, lower arms and legs, and hands and feet of a zebra. His face though was slightly different, particularly his eyes. His eyes were orange and marquise shaped, and not set in the typical spot for an equine. Instead they were centered at the front of his face. \n\nI was a child.  I stared.  I didn’t know if he was real or not. Then he started sprinting.  Like a human.  At me. I started screaming and bolted into the bathroom. I could hear his hooves clicking across our hardwood floor, they got close enough to the bathroom  that I could feel the vibrations from his footsteps in the floor under my feet and then the stopped.  Seconds later my parents were in the bathroom with me as I screamed and cried terrified. \n\nMy parents assumed I was sleepwalking.  Then it happened again.  A few months later I saw the Zebraman again.  And again I stared and he started running at me.  Cue screaming and hiding and my parents coming to comfort me again.  As I got older the Zebraman showed up every time we were lighting the house with candles.  I learned quickly that as long as I just glanced at him he would be gone after I’d gone to the bathroom.  The last time I saw him I was 14.  He chased me that time. Stopping just short of the bathroom Door as he had many times before.  After that, home felt a lot more peaceful at night, like something negative had finally disappeared from my life.",

        "text": "Hi.  To be brief in the first instance, I have experienced spirits both good and bad on and off since I was very young.  I experienced poltergeist/demonic activity as a child but later on had experiences from what seemed to be good spirits. I was also extremely curious of good spirits and got a ouija board.  I had some bad experiences with it, was drunk one day and gave it away.  Later on, just, at least six months ago or more, I was drunk and feeling very down and felt like getting knowledge and contact from the other side again. I wrote a spirit board layout on a piece of A4 paper and used an upturned shot glass.  Nothing obvious happened but I suddenly had had enough completely and didn’t hesitate or feel any resistance to taking an overdose of Quetiapine.  I did it and then went to bed like it was nothing and just fell asleep.  I woke up hours later with my heart pounding and hardly being able to move or speak. It was terrifying.  Things went from there and my friend phoned an ambulance although I remember them constantly asking ‘what happened’ on the phone over and over and over again, it became real annoying and I felt they weren’t listening every time I told them.  Things went from there and during this time and the time in the hospital, some seemingly odd things happened which I don’t wish to expand on but I feel someone benevolent must have been watching over me that day.  Since then, strange things have been happening, usually nothing really overt but noticeable none the less.  I feel it could be a good spirit but it is possible that it isn’t.  I heard odd noises that are definitely not wind from outside kind of noises.  Sometimes there are sudden loud ‘crack’ noises on the fridge but that could be passed off as the fridge itself by anyone sceptical enough.  The thing with these sounds though is that they seem to come at key times as well.  Sometimes I hear a tiny rhythmic rapping sound on the printer next to me, it is definitely not normal, but so covert that people would probably just say I wasn’t in my right mind if I told them.  Sometimes there is the sound of something falling on an odd occasion only to go and check and nothing is out of place.  The last time, my friend heard it too thinking the chess board he had made had fallen in the kitchen but it hadn’t.  He is a total skeptic and will come up with a ‘rational’ explanation for anything even if it couldn’t possibly be the case.  Not so long ago I was in bed and there was the Christmas decorations packed away down the side of the bed in a bag.  It suddenly sounded like it had been lifted and then dropped but I had got used to strange things so much by now that I didn’t let it bother me and I went to sleep.  While I was asleep it became like I was awake and I could feel tingles all over my body only it was warm and didn’t feel evil even if I was a little bit freaked out by it at the same time.  It seemed to last at least an hour.  At one point I could smell my deceased mothers cigarette smoke and I had visions of my passed loved ones.  I was aware I was in bed during all this, it felt like a warm hug from the other side.  I suddenly got woken with three sudden clattering raps on the bedroom window, my close friend was still asleep beside me.  Later when I told him about it he passed it off as a loose piece of wood that hit the vestibule window in the wind.  Now I heard the wood hit yesterday and the three raps or clatters on the bedroom window were nothing like this at all…. He will find anything to fob my experiences off.  Now this is another reason why I think the spirit may be good.  Just around a week or so ago, I had set my alarm as I had an appointment.  I placed the phone on the bedside table beside me and went to sleep.  I woke up to the alarm going off but was a bit confused at first.  The alarm tone was completely different to the tone that I had set, also it was not beside me, it was coming from the floor at the back of the bed.  I thought maybe it was my friends phone at first although I didn’t know how as he didn’t have that tone either.  I got up and went and picked it up and knocked it on to snooze. I got back in bed and lay there for a short while.  When the alarm went off again it was my usual alarm tone.  Now I know sometimes I knock alarms off in my sleep so that is what brought me to the conclusion it could be a helpful spirit.  Of course when I told my close friend about this he wouldn’t have any of it.  He had been out at the time.  He just said it was a glitch with the phone and I must have dropped it down there.  I also have a general feeling of a presence around me but it doesn’t feel totally evil like when I was a child.  There is so much more which I haven’t written here but for whatever reason my typing on the keypad is not keeping up and is very slow the further I get so it is getting really annoying so I will say one more thing and finish off.  I woke up in my apartment one day and the TV was off.  Suddenly what seemed like a strand of spider silk was kind of trailing across it and expanding and contracting.  I looked at it perplexed but it was daylight so that took any freak Ines away from it a bit. I looked closer and there was a tiny ball of condensed white light  travelling up and down it.  It lasted about ten minutes and during this time my curtain was definitively tugged.  I had no windows open and it was definitely a tug.  I felt that the spirit was trying to communicate.  After it went, I went up to the TV just to make sure, beyond a doubt that it wasn’t my imagination and sure enough, there was nothing there.  Now this bigger thing happened today.  I was in bed and suddenly the guitar on top of my close friends wardrobe vibrated like a thud and I could hear after that a lot of noise coming from the bathroom next door. I can only describe it as very intense noise going through the wall and rattling against the radiator.  I felt from the start that this was something paranormal but perhaps for peace of mind passed it off as my close friend making a lot more noise in the bathroom than normal.  Not long after I heard the noise stop, I heard my friend zipping up his jacket and going out the door for his hospital appointment.  I rang him not long after and asked him why he had made so much noise and he outright denied it.  He still seems to think it is all in my head… a thanks for any replies here, I really appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hopping dimensions? So I know the saying don’t sleep with a mirror towards you but that seems to be the only way I can dream and haven’t noticed that was the case until my husband started turning it around at night he felt uncomfortable with it at the foot of our bed😅 but these dreams aren’t normal dreams usually they are premonitions or I’m meeting people who already know me and are waiting for me when I get to this field in an opening like in the mountains. (Same place ever single time) then sometimes I don’t remember anything after. I first thought okay it’s just vivid dreaming but the thing is they come true I’ve been able to predict multiple things like 3 pregnancies in the family that aren’t my own ( I had dreams literally I swear on everything the days I conceived my children so I knew without having to ever take a test) kids broke my mirror a few months back and I have to get another one I haven’t dreamt really at all since it broke. Anyone else ever experience this? Btw I don’t HAVE to have a mirror for my premonitions I knew I was going to die in child labor with my second baby and I almost did I passed out from blood loss while hemorrhaging and I told all my family members this was going to happen but the baby would be okay. Ever since then they always believed me. My husband thinks I’m a witch 😅😅",

        "text": "I had this weird feeling when i was about 13 years old guy (Now about to be 25 in a month) with one of my younger cousins while about to explore an abandoned house right next to the one of my grandparents. One day, we were passing a ball between each other and at the next moment, i turned around towards the basement door creek open a little inwards (note that there was no wind), which made us both bolt out of there. On the next day as we continued our game in a meadow next to the same old house, i had this strange feeling that someone was watching me.   \n\n\nAt first, i decided to not pay attention, but at the same time i was curious.. so i turned my attention to the attic window of the house and saw some dark figure with one hand on the window's bottom frame and had a huge creepy grin on it's face, while i just looked at it. Afterwards, i told my cousin about it, but he didn't believe me.  \n\n\nSo, what do you guys think what this thing could've been? a demon? some other entity? I'd like to read your opinions!.",

        "text": "I moved in my hostel yesterday, there is a forest behind our hostel and few balconies open that side. I'm getting major bad vibes and presence of something out there in the forest area, particularly there is a huge tree I feel like is haunted.\n\nI told some of my Hostel mates too. Everyone is shit scared, including me (I'm the strongest person with all the paranormal knowledge here).\nI tried to create a barrier so no entities enter the hostel and have asked people not to go the balcony past 1.30 am. \n\nAlso, the outer door to one balcony opened even after we locked it. We were 6 people there, all saw it getting locked but nobody saw it getting unlocked, we asked everyone on the floor but nobody knows. (It maybe a terrible prank but tbh, I'm not feeling good)\nI also have a scratch on my arm which I have no clue how it happened. I just noticed it randomly.\n\nI don't want to impose my views on anyone but I also wish nobody makes fun of the entity out there coz it's a unknown one. I know how to communicate and make place a little safer but still I know very less.\n\nI need advice whether I should tell everyone (like my mates in hostel) or wait till something more happens.\n\nTLDR: Felt a presence in the forest outside my hostel and locked the balcony door from where it is visible and asked people to avoid the balcony, terrace and place after 1.30am, the door is the unlocked and nobody knows how (maybe a prank, maybe not), I got a scratch on my arm randomly and now I'm thinking whether to inform everyone or not.",

        "text": "IDK if this is related, I have a fusion with cadaver bone in my neck.  12 years ago, so I have had it a while. I also have a nerve stimulator in my lower back, it's related.\n\nHistory:  I have always had some type of esp, maybe? Like something I just know will happen or see people in meditation and meet them later. Not all the time but enough to know when somethings is going to happen or just something almost like a feeling. I just don't know how to explain it. \nI also have, had my palm read and have that intuition line, so the above stuff I guess was just normal for me. \n\n\n  Ok so here what's going on:\nOk Sunday,  so every night I turn my stim to silent mode so I don't feel it working before bed.  So a few hours later all of a sudden my stim gets strong like I can actually feel it so I'm like wth and pick up the remote and log into it and see that it's turned up to 19, like a crazy number, I have never turned it higher than 6. So I was a little shocked, literally.\n\nTuesday,  about 3am I wake up for no reason and decide to go and get a drink and use the bathroom, so after my drink I go into bathroom and my bathroom scare turns on... So I'm looking around in the dark bathroom and I see this pop up on the scale 00.00.  Now about my scale you have to step on a small square to even turn it on. Nothing was there.  So now after I get up and do my usual day, I go online (yes I know my mistake) and look up why my scale would do that, nothing, if the scale was going bad it only shows lines. Not for nothing looking up signs online gets you lost in a rabbit hole.\n\nToday, again I woke up again at 3am again for no reason. I didn't even have to pee, so I laid there waiting to see if something was going to happen, nothing until I come downstairs and my microwave has this displayed 00:01 and waiting to start. Now I have a thing for all my clocks oven, microwave, Alexa have to be right. Makes me nuts. So I know it was set to the time. Now for the latest thing, I went to my local store and when I went to make my purchase the machine turned off, the employee looked like she was going to cry, she had to literally turn it back on.  And yes I still bought what I wanted, it didn't feel negative almost like a sign. It's hard to explain but my gut I guess told me it was good. Yes weird.\n\nSo here the question I guess, is all this related? I did look up the numbers meaning along which angel runs the day, but it's only leading to more questions.  \n\nI will answer any questions here, because I'm not sure what is and isn't relative.",

About ten years ago someone told me that my great grandmother had a twin sister who died in her crib as an infant, the reason of her death is unknown but as I know there was some guy in the village with a cursed eye in 1920's, basically whatever he looked at would be cursed in some way or another. idk thought it would be fun to share my story.",

        "text": "First time sharing this...  I lived in an 'active' house for about 12 years and I never experienced anything like this before or since.  A bit of background - I've had, what I'll call 'super dreams' my entire life - incredibly realistic dreams of places or events (precognitive) or of people (departed) - I recognize these dreams as, something more than just the typical random, drifting dream - there's definitely something real going on.  So, with that little bit of background, I began having these dreams where, I'd be sitting at a table, across from my, then, wife and she'd start berating me.  Just saying the most hurtful, derogatory, insulting things imaginable - just verbally destroying me to the point where, in the dream, I can't see past the tears - all I could say was, \"Why? Why are you doing this to me?\".  It only seemed to amuse 'her' and increase the severity of 'her' verbal attacks...  I'd wake up, in tears.  This 'dream' would set my entire day off.  These dreams would occur every few weeks - I got to the point where I began to question if my wife really thought these things.  It really started to have a negative impact on my life.  I became depressed and started to withdraw from my wife and my family.  I started to wonder if she really felt or thought that way about me.  Then, the sleep paralysis started.  I never experienced sleep paralysis before and it was terrifying - felt like something was holding me down and there was a noise and a feeling associated with it - like a vibration.  During one sleep paralysis episode, I woke up on my stomach (I'm a side sleeper - my previous sp episodes occurred while laying on my back) and it felt like something was trying to attach itself, like, around my spine - this vibration - just an overwhelming sense that something was trying to enter me.  I began to fight - sheer will to resist.  I snapped out of it but I honestly felt that I had just been in a real fight for my life - like something just tried to possess me.  So, fast forward a bit - a few more bouts of sp and the berating nightmare, until this one dream...  I was in a hallway and 'she' started to come at me and started screaming at me, hurling insults - but this was different than the table dreams, and I noticed something different about 'her' - something was off and I recognized 'it' wasn't 'her'.  I got pissed and confronted 'it' - \"Who are you!?  YOU aren't my wife!  Who are you!?\".  'It' seemed surprised by this and paused for a moment but then came at me again, again hurling insults.  \"NO!  You aren't my wife!  Who are you!?\".  Then, for some reason I started yelling, \"What's your name!?\".  'It' changed - 'it' became scared and started to back away but I was pissed and I started walking towards it ready to fight - \"Who are you!?  WHAT'S YOUR NAME!?\".  It began to panic and shifted into this shadowy dark mass and turned to get away and I went after it - demanding to know its name.  It disappeared into a dark corner - like there was a door there or something, but it got away.  I woke up and I knew this 'thing' this 'entity' was responsible for what I was going through.  The berating dreams and the sleep paralysis - it all stopped after this.  We moved out of that house several years ago and shortly after the move, 'it' appeared again in a dream - I immediately recognized it and I distinctly remember saying, \"Really?  You're going to try this again?\".  That was the last encounter.  I believe this thing was attacking me emotionally and spiritually in an attempt to weaken me so it could attach itself or even, possibly, posses me.  I've been on a journey since this to try and learn or get some answers as to what happened or what's going on but more importantly, I wanted to share, in case anyone else has experienced or is experiencing anything similar.  Thank you for your time.",
