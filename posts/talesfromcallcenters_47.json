Today I politely called to check in on the service and as soon as I said our company she said \"I am so mad at you! Don't you dare call me on Sunday. Go home!\" I apologized for the inconvenience and immediately hung up. This just blows my mind. Our office is open 24/7 and that is very explicit. Why are you mad at me for trying to provide good customer service? I'm sure if you were having trouble you'd call in about it even if it was Sunday!

        "text": "**DISCLAIMER:** While I worked for a wireless carrier and frequently worked with reps and supervisors, I was not a rep myself.\n\n\n**A bit of background:** years and years ago, no such thing as a nationwide wireless/cellular network existed. On a trip from, say, New Orleans to Houston, you'd go through five or six different coverage areas. Some were owned by major corporations, others were regional or even locally owned. Many smaller operators ran their own customer service locally.\n\nOne Friday after work I got a wild hair and decided to head to Lake Charles to see a buddy that'd moved there a few months ago, never mind the five hour drive. Met up with him and we went for the casino boat. At the time, call delivery systems were in their infancy. You had to dial a * code to tell the system you were there and to send calls to you. Except this wasn't working for me, as I found out when I stepped outside after losing a particularly large blackjack hand. Checked voicemail and had a stack of messages, but the phone hadn't rung. So I 611.\n\nCSR: \"Thank you for calling Cellular One of Lake Charles, my name is Janet, how can I help you?\" (Not a real name)\n\nWe go through diagnosing the problem (I used to work for a carrier) and determine the home system is having an issue. Nothing can be done on this end. She's being professional about everything but something just seems... off. Midway through this as we're waiting for I-can't-remember-what, I ask Janet how her evening is going. \"Oh...*ragged intake of breath* fine.\" \n\nOnce all is said and done she goes into the wrap-up script and I blurt out \"You sure you're ok?\" \"Oh yes, I'm...\", and then just loses it. In the space of about two minutes a volume tumbles out about divorce, custody battles, working nights, etc. Midway through a sentence she stops and, \"I... I ... am so sorry, I didn't mean to blurt all that out, thank you for calling Cellu...\" I interrupted again and told her not to think a thing of it, that sometimes we just need someone to listen. I then gently asked about call recording and metrics (as I mentioned earlier, I worked for a carrier back then). \n\nTurns out; small company, rudimentary metrics {that were ignored for the graveyard shift), and the recordings were only retrieved in case of subpoena, emergency, or a customer complained of egregious behavior on the part of a CSR. We compared notes for a few more minutes, then I bid her a good night and told her if she needed an ear she knew where to find me. Astonishingly enough, she did. We ended up becoming friends, although I lost track of her years ago. \n\nI miss those days. Everything is so centralized, sanitized and scrutinized now. I suppose it makes for more consistent standards, but there's a certain human factor that's been eradicated. If you've read this far, thanks for reading my random ramblings.\n\n**TL;DR: Asked a rep how her day was going one too many times and caused an emotional dam failure.**",

It was quite frankly the worst job I've ever had, and gave me a real glimpse into how dark and horrible people could be. This story is a little lighter. Just another shift, and I had an inbound call.  The guy on the other end took a deep breath, and within seconds I could tell he had rehearsed this.\n\n\"I am calling as a representative of the fictional construct that is Mr John Doe (Names changed to protect the...i don't know) to discuss the matter of the alleged funds that are claimed to have been utilised by him\"\n\nNow when someone starts the conversation like that, all you could really do is let the silence hang for a second, then launch into your script. \n\n\"Okay sir, for me to be able to discuss this I need the reference number and to confirm authority. \"\n\nOn opening the account I saw that it was in the name John Doe, and he had no other authorised contacts. This meant I could only talk to the person whose name it was in. I relayed the information to the (suspected) debtor. I asked him straight if he was John Doe. He refused to answer the question directly, instead spiraling off into complex explanations about fictional constructs and social contracts. The best I could get was that he would state that he was referred to as John Doe by some groups. Security was a nightmare, but I managed to placate by assuring him that we already held the data, and we weren't fishing for more. Finally I could talk openly about the debt. It was a credit card balance on a card that had been maxed out, and not a single payment made back. Interest had snowballed and it passed to us. Before I could talk, he cut in.\n\n\"Have you ever heard of the Freemen on the Land?\"\n\nI had not. But I wasn't going to let this conversation be derailed again. Whilst confirming I did know what they were, I googled the Wikipedia and scanned the page. Individuals who feel statute laws don't apply if they don't consent. I already knew I wasn't gonna get anything out of this guy. He was calling up to try and posture. At this point he made reference to the fact that he considered John Doe to be a fictional construct and a light-bulb went on in my head.\n\n\"Did you....did you take out a credit card with an identity that you consider to be fictional,sir?\n\n\"Ye............\"\n\nAt this point some survival instinct kicked in and he went silent. I moved in for the kill.\n\n\"I feel I should remind you that all calls are recorded, sir\"\n\nHe started to stammer, and skipped to the beginning of his speech to start again. I let him talk talk, and waited until he got to the part about the fictional identity. He balked at the words and went silent. He finally hung up. \n\nI guarantee you that he didn't make this song and dance when he was taking the bloody card out.",

I love it, it's so much better than the phones because you don't have to waste mental and emotional energy dealing with idiots. However, this one lady made me a little pissed:\n\n    Me: Hello Lady!\n    Me: How can I help you?\n    Lady: I would like to know about your returns policy.\n\n(*at this point, I'm dealing with about 4 other chats simultaneously that just came in*)\n\n    Me: &lt;pastes generic returns policy scripting&gt;\n    Lady: Wow, I thought your company was known for having more personalized customer service\n    \nAt this point, I got a little offended. I wanted to say \"Hey Lady, I'd like to see you try talking to 6 people at once and provide personalized service. I doubt you could.\" Instead, I said:\n\n    Me: I apologize Lady, live chat is not always the best place to receive personalized service. I would recommend calling &lt;company phone number&gt; for further assistance.\n    Lady: &lt;disconnects&gt;\n\nTelling people to call in is one of my favorite things about this job, because a majority of the things that happen at our company we are not allowed to help the customer over chat with. I know I'm not the one that has to deal with them when I send them to the phones. Man, I wish I could have a full-time chat position.\n\n______________________________\n\nBonus story!\n\nI got a call from a customer it was a typical problem, nothing too hard, but there were unusually long notes in his order.\n\n    Guy: Hello, can you please look up my order? I was supposed to get a call back from someone.\n    Me: &lt;Sees long notes in order&gt; Okay sir, just give me one moment while I read through these notes. &lt;Places on hold&gt;\n    Me: &lt;Sends IM to supervisor&gt;: It says that you were going to call this customer back? &lt;pastes link&gt;\n    Supervisor: &lt;IMs back&gt;: I don't remember talking to this customer at all.\n    Me: Well, it says here that &lt;other CS rep&gt; passed it on to &lt;other OTHER CS rep&gt; who left them a voicemail saying that you would speak to them.\n\n(*Our supervisors, unlike a lot of others that I read on this subreddt, are actually competent and also double as escalation specialists. They don't usually take over an order unless it's a major escalation situation and we are expected to help the customer as much as we can to keep the supervisors from being too busy. The issue they were having was extremely mild, something that should have been handled with one call.*)\n\n    Me: &lt;Back on phone with customer&gt;: Sir, it says here that someone had left you a message. Do you know who that was?\n    Guy: Hold on, I think I have the message on our other phone. Ah yes, here it is. &lt;holds his other phone up to the phone he's talking to me on&gt;\n    Message: Hello, this is &lt;other OTHER CS rep&gt;, I do see that this problem may require a supervisor to speak with you, &lt;Supervisor's name&gt; will be calling you back soon to speak about this.\n\n(*I'm facepalming at this point. I put Guy on hold again and I walk over to my supervisor's desk*)\n\n    Me: Hey supervisor, I know you're busy, but &lt;other OTHER CS rep&gt; said that you would talk to this guy, and now their expectation is that you will be handling it. I'm really sorry about this.\n    Supervisor: *Sigh...* Okay, I know it's not your fault, send him through.\n\nSo... the moral of the story: take ownership of your own gosh darned problems, geez.",

        "text": "This is the saga of 1 member. Out of all 300,000 which we deal with throughout the year, she is one of those we all know by name. I'll call her Mrs B although that's obviously not even close to her real name and I will alter some of the information to make it less easy to identify the company and/or person in question. If any of this is against the rules please let me know and I'll stop updating the post. \n\nOk let's begin.\n\n---\n\nA member (whom I shall call Mrs B for privacy) often calls in and, from the moment you pick up the call, fires a flurry of verbosity at you. Although most is unintelligible, she is extremely polite and complimentary of whomever takes the call. Here are some of my favourite logs which document her craziness...\n\n---\n\n\"Mrs B wanted to make sure that her order that she's posted in to arrive soon is to notbe delivered between Wed 16th and Sun 20th. Any other Tuesday or Friday is fine.\n\n\nMrs B also wanted us to know that she loves listening to music and it plays a big part in her life. She appreciates everything we do here for her custom and thinks it must be very complicated doing what we do and keeping track of all our vans. She wants us to know that as a Christian she knows that Burgundy's are definitely something to look forward to. She asked me about delivery times around the country and if they are difficult to do but cut me off when I started to answer before telling me again how happy she was to listen to music and drink wine as a Christian of [retailer]\"\n\n---\n\nMember called at to ask why people drink Brandy after a meal.\n\nShe then decided it would be a good idea to either order one, or get a bottle of cognac, or possibly sloe gin.\n\nShe will phone back in June when she decides which one as it was a little expensive today, she may or may not place an order at this time.\n\nThe member then informed me she hadn't touched a drop of alcohol until 1995. The reasoning behind this was she now believes it is the blood of Christ, and it will help ward off Satan.\n\nMember then blessed [retailer], and informed us she believes we must be a very holy company.\n\nMember then treated me to some wine advice by informing me that only wines with no sugar should be drunk (all wines have sugar in them), as the others are not up to the taste she remembers from when her dad used to let her try some, and therefore bad and not worth your money. \n\nMember has placed an open invite to everyone to join her at church, but to bless those who cannot make it.\n\nMember then informed us she was a royalist, and would like to thank the company for all the good work we do, and me for the conversation (although it was very one sided)\n\n---\n\nMember called to check up on the price of port as she wants to send a bottle to her brother as a gift with a Christmas Greeting, the order will be sent in the post in a day or two. She likes port, as a child of 15 she was given a glass of very good red, and although she didn't like it she said that she did, but has now very much changed her opinion on the matter, after all red wine was the first milk of the Cain of Galilee...\n\nMbr very much likes the magazine and wishes her lady friend who is a vicar at 96 could have one. She has a small parish on the West coast of Africa, has a very broad smile and has restored her faith in human nature.\n\nMbr very happy with us and the magazine and will send in an order by post to go to her brother with a Christmas Greeting. She once again reminded us of her devotion to Jesus Christ.\n\n---\n\nMrs B originally called to ask if our bottles were bigger as they looked very large in the photos. I said that this would depend on the picture as some might feature magnums or larger sizes, but she insisted that in all the pictures they looked much bigger. She told me the page of our brochure. There are no pictures on this page.\n\nThen Mrs B made reference to a healing Sanctuary that she visits where there's a woman who has visions of Christ.\n\nQuickly moving on to how she doesn't have much money to buy, but will if there are any more babies born as she will get them a port as her father did that she drank on her 21st Birthday. A relative of hers bought some beers for another relative from us this Christmas, but apparently they can't be taken out of the country. Mrs B contacted the police about this who said to contact the Post Office which she felt was a bit barmy. What do they know about the law? It turns out that the drink couldn't be taken out of the country so it must be consumed here.\n\nMrs B wanted to say Happy New Year and to thank us so much for what we do and for bringing Christ into the World.\n\n---\n\nSpoke to Mrs B's brother, who kept addressing me as \"Mr Joan\" (his name doesn't even have a J in it). He is going to ask Mrs B to call us back when she returns. I'm happy to talk \"to\" her if this is the case.”\n\n---\n\nAdvised Mrs B that 1 unit of a 40% spirit works out to 25ml. She was very grateful and invited me to join her Church and come to the theatre with her so I can see the statue of a policeman outside.\n\nAlso mentioned she works for a Christian charity because they've been so good to her. Her father used to give her a glass of wine on Sundays when she was a girl, and she started to drink wine regularly when she became a member. She likes French, Chilean, Brazilian, German and Austrian wine but doesn't want to risk the stuff they make in Russia or the Outer Hebrides. She's now on medication because she had too much fun when she was younger but her doctor trusts her. She was living in the wilderness for 15 years, then came home in 1981 and started to live with Christians. It's a lesson about how much merriment we should accept.\n\nShe now sometimes helps at the borstal where she sees things that really upset her but it's really rewarding and she likes it when they play the drums, even though it can be very loud.\n\nAlso the Holy War was important because it hadn't happened before or since. Charles died for his country and his beliefs and we shouldn't have a Catholic on the throne. Also told me in the strictest confidence that Charles' son had 18 illegitimate children. Martyrdom in the 15th Century was bad but they just didn't have the same understanding about religion that she does. There's a lot more Jehovah's Witnesses, Non-conformists and Puritans moving to her area (just down the road from Queen Anne) and she imagines there'll be more throughout her lifetime. And she was Christened on 3rd Oct 1937 by her father.\n\nFinal comments were that she's a Royalist, being a member has been a wonderful gift to her and she's really touched by us.\n\n---\n\nThat's all I really have access to at the moment. Some other comments are usually \"I have no idea what Mrs B said during that call, but she seemed happy\" or \"Member said a lot about different items but didn't make it clear that she wanted me to run through an order... I'm sure she'll call back.\"\n\nHope they brought you some amusement and that they may be well received.\n",

        "text": "Here's what I want to say to consumers who think this way. \n\nNext time you call your company, just think about this: if you ask to be transferred to a supervisor seven times, do you really think there's seven more levels of management actively on the phones waiting for your call? Imagine this from a business perspective... does it really make financial sense to staff a Tier 8 customer service supervisor? \n\nNo. Of course it does not. Yet people still subscribe to this idea that if you keep working your way up the phone tree, you'll eventually reach the CEO of the company or whatever. \n\nHere's what happens 100% of the time. You ask for a sup, you get transferred to a sup. You've gone from Tier 1 to Tier 2. You talk to that sup, he informs you that there's no way to resolve your request, so you work up to Tier 3. Around this time, you've hit what I call the \"phone ceiling\". If an associate says they can get you to someone higher up at this point, they're lying. No company has the resources to staff that many levels of escalation. What they're probably doing instead is transferring you to another Tier 3 and not telling you. So while you think you may be climing the phone tree, you may be climbing laterally. For the record, my company does NOT allow this behavior... but policies vary of course. \n\nMe? I am Tier II. I'm the highest tier that takes calls for a living. My boss would love to be on the phones waiting for a call. However, in the middle of managing 27 people a day, going to meetings and monitoring calls, he simply doesn't have time to take calls. Not every job in a company is customer-focused--at some point, the company needs to focus on finances, quality management and human resources. \n\nAnyhow, this is where the phone ceiling comes in. I'm literally the highest tier you can escalate directly to. If you don't like what I have to say, I can't transfer you to anyone (unfortunately). We can have someone call you back, but we can never escalate directly to that department. \n\nI work in banking. I hate to say \"no\" to people, but when I do, it's for compliance reasons. If you're not the primary on the account and you want to close that account, that's a hard and simple \"no\". It's not company policy--it's the law. I cannot legally let you close that account unless you get the primary on the phone. If you don't like that... well... tough.\n\nSo here's what happens to the phone tree climbers: they get told no, they get told no again, then they escalate as high as we can possibly go... only to be told no one last time. \n\nIn conclusion: stop climbing the phone tree. You'll waste your time not getting what you want... and you'll waste the company's time when you keep pestering them. If your cable bill went up by $70 with no notice *and nobody in customer service will help you resolve the issue*\\*, file a complaint with the BBB and the FTC. That company couldn't give a shit less about you... but the second they start receiving bad press or legal scrutiny, they'll warm up to the idea of helping you *very* quickly. \n\n\\*edited for clarity since /u/asfinfrock pointed out that you should call customer service before doing these things.

An older lady answered my greetings and asked me what city was smack dab in the middle between two cities in Florida (Orlando and another one I can't remember) I checked it out and told her. She then proceed to ask me to find the cheapest hotel they had and also if they had a pier close by that had any shops and attractions. I asked if she was planning a trip there and if so I could transfer her to one of our departments that will help her plan it. She replied no and started to tell me a variety of medical issues she has and that she didn't know how to use a computer which is why she called us. The city in the middle didn't have a pier so she asked me to find one in one of the other cities she asked about previously, so I find it and give her a phone number and she thanks me and hangs up. Apparently her son is trying to start a business at a pier in that area, so I guess if I hear any thing about it I can feel like I was a part of it. I've only worked for this company a few months, but this was the strangest request I've had so far...defiantly not the worst though.",

        "text": "So, there's this person I transfer to who leaps violently to conclusions after listening to *maybe* three words that you've said, then yells at you for whatever stupid thing she's decided you obviously did. Then she does it again when you try to explain what you're *really* transferring for, and yells at you again for this *new* thing she's decided that you did. This repeats until you've managed to get the whole story out, at which point she'll paraphrase it back to you like you *haven't* just spent five minutes trying to explain it to her, and smugly tell you that, even though you could've figured that out on your own, she'll kindly take the call and fix it for you.\n\nI want to sit her down and explain to her that not only do she and I have the same credentials, just in different departments, but that I have worked here for two years and I know what the fuck I'm doing. Furthermore, I am an adult, I live on my own, I pay my own bills, and she does not need to talk down to me like I'm some second-grader who didn't bother to read the instructions.\n\nAnyway. She finally pissed me off enough to warrant her own post.\n\nSo, we work for an insurance company. We're both licensed insurance agents, although I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm on the non-licensed team because she gets righteously offended whenever I tell her I've made a policy change, but that's beside the point. For the basis of this story, there's this thing that happens when a customer answers \"yes\" to one of our flagged questions, which basically tells us that they're going to be a huge liability to insure. The application is placed on hold while we send them out a request for more information, which we then review and decide whether or not we'll cover them. These applications are a huge pain in the ass to find, because they ONLY come up when you search by the customer's full name, in a system that can't handle punctuation such as hyphens or double first names, so someone with a name like, for example, Anna Marie Marcus-Johnson is pretty much screwed.\n\nBUT, if the customer had a PREVIOUS policy with us, and you search by the old policy number, BOTH the expired policy, AND the application will pop up. This is Stupid Insurance Database 101. Non-licensed people who transfer calls to me routinely tell me \"I'm gonna give you the policy number, but I want you to look at the application.\" I understand what this means because I've worked here for more than a week.\n\nSo, basically I get a caller whose request packet never arrived. The customer asks if we can just save some time and email it to them. I don't have access to the packet because I don't handle incoming applications, only existing policies, so I put the customer on hold and consult with the department who does, and I get this *person,* who I will call DeeDee.\n\nMe: \"Hi, this is FlyingGuineaPig in the (location) office, and I have a policy number for you, but I need you to look at the application.\"\n\nDeeDee: (at full volume) \"WHAT!?!?! NO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! JUST SPELL THEIR NAME!\"\n\nMe: \"Ohkaaay...(I spell their name, she doesn't find it, I spell their name again, it comes up, and I feel vindicated that I probably did, in fact, know what I was saying.) So, you can see they previously had a policy. What I meant was I was gonna give you the number so-\"\n\nDeeDee: \"NO! THIS POLICY IS TOO OLD; IT'S EXPIRED! THEY NEED TO REAPPLY! YOU HAVE TO *COUNT* THE MONTHS-\"\n\nMe: \"No, no! They *did* reapply! I need you to look at the application, because-\"\n\nDeeDee: \"THEY ANSWERED YES TO ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS! TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO RETURN THE PACKET-\"\n\nMe: \"I know, I know, but the packet never arrived, so they want us to email it.\"\n\nDeeDee: \"OKAY, SO EMAIL IT!\"\n\nMe: \"I can't; I don't have access to it. I need *you* to email it!\"\n\nDeeDee: \"YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO LEARN ANYTHING IF YOU JUST KEEP TRANSFERRING!\"\n\nMe: \"No, you don't understand; I *don't have access* to the packet. They didn't give me the packet. No one in my department has the packet. *You* need to send her the packet.\"\n\nDeeDee: \"ALL SHE NEEDS AT THIS POINT IS THE PACKET, SO I'M GONNA EMAIL IT TO HER, BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO TRY AND SOLVE THESE THINGS ON YOUR OWN!\"\n\nMe: (with steam pouring out my ears) \"That is *exactly* why I'm transferring to you, yes; you've got that right. *So,* I'm gonna put the customer through now!\"\n\nAnd I did. And then filed a complaint with my supervisor, although I was too angry to articulate our entire conversation. And I'm still really fucking angry. Because if she would just *shut up for a minute,* I could tell her what was *actually fucking happening.*\n\n*And she does this every single time I get her!*\n\n",

        "text": "I actually woke up on black Friday and had a long, winding diatribe that I ended up saving into a Google doc with the intention of shortening it down to a post. I'll just post this, hopefully shorter, little bit instead.\n\nAt 28, 5-6 years out of college I started a job in financial sales at a call center. I hated it and moved into one of their smaller companies. In reality I have little to say negative about the company other than I couldn't see myself in a call center in 10 years. I quit them. It was hard because it wasn't that I hated the job but that I was bored silly and underwhelmed. They did all of the right things to make it a good call center to work with culture, engagement and incentives.\n\nI needed more and I went back to school for a engineering/technician degree at a local community college. To put bread on the table I took a job with a mediocre call center. It tried to be the job I mentioned above but failed at it because you could tell the people in charge didn't have the balls to take a risk and do more than pay lip service and bring in bagels on Friday.\n\nManagement knew I wasn't going to stay and today I quit because I got a job doing inside sales for an engineering company. Basically I'll be using my phone sales skills still but there will be a technical side that can only grow. I start on Monday but told my old, mediocre employer that I couldn't do it anymore. I quit today at the beginning of my shift. I'm nearly doubling my salary\n\nFor me, the satisfaction was telling my boss with whom I went round and round about how to do phone sales that I was quitting. The person didn't care and it was very routine for her, but in my heart I feel it was conveyed \"I'm better than this and you know it\". \n\nI know I'm boasting a little, but all I want to say is that working at a call center does teach you skills that are valuable elsewhere. It might take a plan and some chutzpah, but I'm confident everyone here who wants a change can do it.\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

I have an environmental allergy that that started to flare up a few months ago, and it's pretty up in the air whether I'll be able to work anywhere with a lunch room (the allergy is garlic and onion and even a tiny bit of steam from someone's lunch will set off a reaction. I have an epipen but I haven't had to use it yet.) So, I'm looking for something that will let me work from home.\n\nI live out in the country, and the best internet I can get is 7mbps down and 640 kbps up. (Not sure if I can move into town--apartment buildings are likely out because of cooking in other apartments. I'm looking for a cheap townhouse or something that is at least partly separate.) I do have space to set up a desk.\n\nI know we aren't supposed to identify companies, so if you have a recommendation and would rather PM me, I'd appreciate it. :)",

        "text": "This happened in the last few days. I work for cable, internet, and home phone service provider in Ontario.\n\nCustomer calls in stating he had his son come and visit and by chance his son looked at the bill. And explained to him that he is paying for internet and cable tv. After the formalities of getting in to the account he tells me he never uses the internet and wants everything credited back to him. Ok, i think, it doesn't seem like a huge problem so it probably the first bill he's seeing internet charges on it. And i can credit that back as we give you 2 months to the very most 6 months to dispute a bill. As I'm looking he tells me that he was offered a free DVR/PVR back awhile ago and that he remembers an agent asking him about the internet.  \n\n\nSo i look further. He had the free cable box rental added in July 2014. So the idea was at the time that his bill would not go up and that's why he added it. So that happen with out any issue. However, it looked like the internet was added on at the same time. For a one year promo at 29.95. And if anyone is interested i believe at the time it was a 10mbps line with 80gb a month. Our lowest plan. Anyways the key point is for year he had at 29.95 then in July 2015 it went up to 49.95. So the conversation kinda went like this. (He'll be Bob for this story)\n\nKurtins: So I'm seeing here that the internet was for sure added back in July 2014. The tech came out installed your DVR and our modem at the same time. And you were promised the free rental?\n\nBob: Yes. That's why i took it but i have no use for the internet i don't have anything the uses the internet. I dont care for the internet. I've never used it. I want it all credited bank to me.\n\nKurtins: I really don't think i can credit this whole amount back as it was so long ago. You never noticed the extra 30 dollar increase on your Bill when you added the free dvr?\n\nBob: No. I just though it was extra charge i had to pay and i just continued paying the bill. \n\nKurtins: And you never called us at the time? Any time you have questions about the bill we want you to call us as we don't have people watching over the bill. \n\nBob: No i don't really pay attention to bill and i don't really understand it that's why i had my son look at it. I still want the whole time credited back to me. I never used it.\n\nKurtins: I still don't think i can credit this whole thing back to you. I can see that the modem hasn't seen Any usage in the last three months. So maybe that's the extent we could do.\n\nBob: No I never used i want the whole thing credited back.\n\nKurtins: Well I'm not authorized to credit even two months of service. Let me get a hold of my support and see what they will allow me to do.\n\nBob: I want everything back tell them that.\n\nKurtins: I will, I'll contact them now.\n\nAt this point i know dam well he it's not getting the whole amount back. This is more of me wanting to know am i crediting this guy back one, two or three months back. Support looks at it. I tell them the jist of everything. No he never really noticed the increase. Not even a year later in July 2015 when his promo was done. He never called us to ask why his bill went up by $20. After a few shared laughs at the stupidty of it all. They allow me 2 months, nothing more and to tell him we give you 2 months to dispute the bill. We can not credit the whole amount back.\n\n\nAs you can guess he didn't like that. He stated that he never wanted the internet in the first place and that this is bullshit. We need to credit the whole thing back. I advised him we can only give you 2 months credit. Reminded him we give a few months to dispute a bill. At the very most 6 months And that this is well over a year. Asked to speak to supervisor. I ended getting same one i talked to 3 minutes prior. Checked back about hour later we canceled the internet gave him 2 months credits.\n\n We're not going to hold your hand check your own bill. Call us, ask questions. There is a reason why we have a call centre.\n",

        "text": "This one's kinda long, but I'll do my best to paraphrase some of it so I don't bore you.\n\nA little background: I'm a supervisor in a call center for a textbook distributor.  We sell both physical textbooks and eBooks.  My department specifically provides tech support for eBooks.  About 90% of which is \"I can't figure out how to access my eBook!\"  Which translates into \"I can't click on the link in the confirmation email that will take me straight to my eBook.\"  But i digress.  My position is literally a supervisor.  I oversee agents, worry about metrics (which in my center are, thankfully, extremely lax), discipline and reward.  It's very rare where I'll have to take an escalated call.  This is one of those times.\n\nCast: EC = Escalated Caller, Me = Me (duh)\n\nSo I'm on break and standing outside smoking my griefs away (people complain, myself included, about idiotic/annoying customers.  You don't realize how much employees can be the same way until you supervise them).  When, of course, out comes rushing one of our most annoyingly incompetent employees (nicest woman in the world, absolutely sucks at her job and HR won't let us fire her because she hasn't actually done anything wrong other than just suck).  I'm thinking, \"Great.  What'd she screw up this time?\"  Sure enough she tells me she has a customer on the phone that she was working with about a problem with his eBook and he's extremely mad and wants to talk to a supervisor and nobody else is available.  I sigh, put my cigarette out, and head back to my desk and she transfers me the call.  I should point out that the customer swears a lot, which I have redacted, but never actually at me.\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for your patience.  My name is Jacobn43.  I understand you requested to speak with a supervisor.  How can I help?\n\n&gt;EC: Your (expletive deleted) eBook is wrong!  The page numbers are wrong! It says there's only 5 chapters when there's actually supposed to be 76!  The page numbers don't match up!  I want my eBook fixed NOW!\n\nTakes a deep breath...\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry for the troubles EC.  Is this regarding XYX Title?  Ok, let me open it up and take a look.\n\nNow I should point out that with these eBooks there are different formats, ePub, PDF, etc... Each one works a different way.  But the eBook reader will display them all.\n\n&gt;Me: OK, I think I see what's going on.  The chapters you're referring to are actually the sections of the book.  For example, Section 1 covers chapters 1-17 just like in the physical book.  As for the page numbers being off it's because this eBook is actually a direct scan of the physical book.  The publisher literally took a copy of the book and scanned it into the computer.  So while the physical book starts page 1 at the Introduction in the book, which is the page numbers you're seeing at the top of each page, the reader starts page 1 on the cover page.  All you need to do is add 17 to the page number you need to go to.\n\n&gt;EC: I don't get it.  Stop trying to confuse me!\n\n&gt;Me: For example, If your professor tells you to go to page 303, you would actually go to page 320.  I understand it's a pain in the ass, but we don't have anyway of changing that.\n\n&gt;EC: No! You need to just fix this.  I want you to fix this now.\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, I'm sorry.  I know it's a pain in the ass, but there is literally no way for me to do that.  It's the format of the book the publisher decided to go with.\n\n&gt;EC: Then you need to re-scan the book in a different format!\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, that would violate numerous copyright laws.  Not only would the fines be extremely hefty, but we would most likely never be able to do business with that publisher again.  And they're literally one of the largest publishers of textbooks in the world.  If we were not allow to sell their products we would probably go out of business.\n\n&gt;EC: (Finally starting to get it through his head that nothing can be done.) Fine, but I can't keep searching blindly through a book looking for a page number the professor is talking about.\n\n&gt;Me: (At this point I've pretty much given up and my voice just sounds like I don't care.)  All you have to do is add 17 to the page number.\n\n&gt;EC: No.  You need to go through the book and find all the correct page numbers for each chapter!\n\n&gt;Me: Would that make you happy sir?\n\n&gt;EC: Yes!\n\n&gt;Me: Fine, I'll have that emailed to you within the hour.\n\nThe call then proceeds to end normally.  And like the good little peon I am I proceed to do that for him (it literally only took me like 5 minutes because the table of contents was at the beginning of the book and I just added 17, miraculously, to each page number).\n\nThis is why I hate adult students.\n\nEdit: Formatting and grammatical fixes.  And I should clarify that by \"adult students\" I mean middle-aged.",

        "text": "I'll just start off with the fact that my little call center job, is a little bit of sales and a little bit customer service if anybody wants any background. \n\nThis has to do with sales side of it, where I'm making reservation for someone. Now we have a little system like most call centers do where we can save information from previous customers like their name and phone number. So when we start quotes we ask for a phone number and email and sometimes with new customers and even previous customers get kinda huffy and suspicious when we ask for it because MUH INFORMATION I guess, so when they ask what for I just say to see if you're in our system, to either they'll comply or refuse again. Which is annoying because if we at least leave a quote, we get 50% of the reservation bonus. \n\nSo I'm working the graveyard shift today, where I get all the dumb questions, the complaints, and prank phone calls which go against my score for sales. So I get a call finally asking for a quote which leads into my automatic customer service voice\n\nME:HI there! Thank you for calling blah blah this is releasethekraken42, what can I help you with\n\nCustomer: Yeah I need a quote for blah blah \n\nMe: Yeah no problem can I start off with a cell phone number or email address? \n*keep in mind I just dealt with some control freak lady who got mad when I wouldnt tell her state I was in so I was not in the mood for bullshit*\n\nCustomer: My cell phone number?? For a quote? Wow that's horrible, what else do you need my daughters last name? \n\nI was just thinking like good God man, you couldn't have just said no? I would have gone on with the quote anyways. I've been working at this same job for two going on three years and I hate taking shit from customers. I will always point out rudeness, especially during graveyard shift because all I get is shitty calls and it messes with my sales number which equals trouble from the boss. It wastes my time and theirs too. So that's what I did. \n\nMe: Wow, there's no need to be sarcastic with me sir, all I need is a phone number \n*slight pause on the other side*\n\nCustomer: Oh.. Oh my gosh, if I am being sarcastic I'm just joking. I'm so sorry, you said you needed my phone number? *gives me number* \n\nThen I felt bad, because like wow he just realized that he wasn't being a great person. \n\nMe: No no its okay, it's just been a long day if getting chewed out and prank phone callers. Thank you for the number if you don't wanna provide your name that's fine. \n\nCustomer: Wow, nobody has ever called me out like that before. I'm so sorry. \n\nSo we went on and he actually reserved the equipment with me and he chuckled and was like now we can be friends again. That made the rest of my shift better, I'm probably gonna get worse calls in the future but I'll always remember this as the call where I broke through.",

That's 240 minutes of international calls I didn't use! What are you going to do about that?\n\nM: We could file a complaint, and the complaints department has the power to offer you a refund, or extra minutes, or any other thing you might ask for in that complaint. I wish I could offer it to you myself, but sadly, us, the humble, puny customer service agents do not have that kind of power. Only the Complaints Dept has it. &lt;audible, theatrical sigh.&gt;\n\nC: OK, how do I file a complaint then?\n\nM: &lt;Gives him the email adress.&gt;\n\nC: Well, thank you very much, Miss &lt;my full name&gt;.\n\nM: Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\nC: No, thank you, Miss &lt;my full name&gt;.\n\nM: Have a great day and thank you for calling. &lt;3 (Goodbye, beautiful stranger.

I was one of the poor sods you'd get on the frontline who was responsible for completing basic tasks and transferring your call to a specialist if your request was more complicated.\n\nAs with all call centres there were call metrics a laundry list long. One of my favourites was the \"customer satisfaction\" score. Basically this entailed someone calling up one of the customers you spoke to a few days later and asking them to give a score out of ten for their experience. You'd get three of these a month and your overall score would impact what payrise you'd get at the end of the year. A \"10\" was a pass, a \"9\" was say 50% and \"1-8\" were considered fails. Over my time there I received fail scores for:\n\n1. I was \"perfect\" but they didn't like the automatic menu thing before they spoke to me so I got a \"7\".\n2. The outbound survey guy interrupted them during dinner or something so they gave a \"1\".\n3. They couldn't remember the call so gave me a \"5\".\n\nOn my last outbound survey for the year I needed a 10 to qualify for a particular payrise. This was the feedback I got: \"Outstanding service. Could not have been better. Scoring a '9' because I don't believe in giving 'perfect' scores as anyone can improve.\"",

        "text": "I work in a call center booking reservations for an extended stay hotel chain. overnight. I get some...people...\nI received this call a few nights ago.\n\nAgent:Thank you for calling [hotel chain] my name is [I'm dumb and my username is my name], how may I help you tonight?\n\nMan:Yes, hello, I need the WiFi password.\n\nAgent: I will be more than happy to assist you. I am at the central reservations office and I do not have access to those passwords, however if you call this number back and press 0 that will get you straight to the front desk and they will be able to assist you further.\n\nMan: I did press 0, no one answered. Someone else [hilariously it turned out to be my mother, who is an agent on the same account at the desk next to me] told me to go down to the front desk but there is no one here.\n\nAgent: I do apologize about the trouble you are having tonight, but the front desk attendant is the only person that would have the password for you. There is a night attendant on sight at all hours of the night, but they do leave the front desk to do nightly chores such as laundry. You would need to keep calling them back, I guarantee someone will answer and help you.\n\nMan, rather rudely: There is no one here. Ma'am, I have been outside beating on these doors, there are people out here trying to get checked in. What can you do to help me?\n\nAgent:Sir, there would be no way for me to contact the front desk for you, you would need to keep trying them back. The guests trying to check in can use our call box outside the door to page our night attendant and if they do still encounter problems they can call us and we will be more than happy to assist them further [the only legitimate reason we can call the hotel or its manager.]\nIn the meantime, the only thing I would be able to do is to file a complaint for you with the manager of the hotel, and they will get back to you within 24-48 hours and talk to you further about compensating you for your troubles. \n\nMan:That's bullshit. I need someone to help me now. [at 3am.] Fine, fill out the complaint, but I will be speaking to someone in the morning about possibly cancelling my reservation. Do call this customer service?\n\nAgent: I once again do apologize, I understand this is a very frustrating situation for you. Let me pull up your reservation and get some information off of it to fill out your complaint form [required]. Do you happen to have your confirmation number?\n\nMan: No. [of course not.]\n\nAgent: I'll just look that up by your last name [...and check in date and specific property number...]\n\nMan: Thats [generic last name]. *proceeds to give me check in date as well.\n\nAgent:Thank you, and to verify that I have the correct information, can you verify your telephone number for me?\n\nMan: *gives number\n\nAgent: And for security purposes can you give me the address that you used on that reservation?\n\nMan: There is no such thing as security in this {field.} I used to work for a police station and I know that nothing is for security reasons. You know who I am [yeah, some rando on the phone].\n\nAgent: We are required to verify a few pieces of information just to make sure that we are talking to the correct person and to secure your sensitive information.\n\nMan:I'm already a guest here, you can see my information, you know who I am.\n\nAgent:And can you verify that by giving me the address that you used on the reservation?\"\n\n*Man hangs up phone.\n\nNo, I don't automatically know who that random guy two thousand miles away is by his voice and I certainly do have to ask these questions for security reasons. We have a lot of customers who would like discretion for various reasons, and asking questions ensure that information like their location is not given out to random people pretending to be the guest.\n\nOn the other hand, I was proud of myself, I rattled it out without a hitch.\n\n \n\n",

We can't go around terminating random accounts.\n\n**AG**: BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN USING IT. CANCEL IT NOW, REMOVE MY PRE-AUTHORIZED PAYMENT!\n\n**Me**: I've already done that. You will no longer be charged for this service and the service will be terminated at the end of your bill cycle.

Grace period voided, locate the interest rate, got my how we calculate interest answer ready and I start typing the answers.\n\nC: Are you doing anything? What's taking so long?\nC: Helloooooooooo???????\nC: Hi.\nC: Hi.\nC: Yoohooooooo\nC: ?? \nC: ?\n\nThis was it... like honest to god. This is where I have disconnected if I could.

Then I repaste my so far typed answers, finish them...and just as I am about to send....\n\nHe hangs up.   \n\nDisconnected. Session terminated by Visitor.  Chat was all in all... 3 minutes maaaaybe 4? \n\nAnd then... then... I see his interaction survey. \n\nVery dissatisfied. Comments:  I was too slow to answer a few simple questions. (simple?  Lol, he thinks interest calculation is simple, how cute).  \n\nAnd then he comes back.  To complain to me. About me.  Cause the first me,  was incompetent. But the second me...oh I am so much nicer, and fast, and so efficient... \nAfter trash talking me to me for a few moments...and me defending the other me...he still doesn't know why he got interest...I had offered to explain but no thanks.  It doesn't really matter, was just $12.83.  FML. \n\nAny other full moon adventures on the phone/in the chat box?",

I kept telling her that I couldn't do anything unless she told me which bus route she was riding and where she got off the bus. \n\nFinally, while she was in the middle of another rant, I sent out an email to every coworker who I knew was working today. I got three different emails back immediately about how the lady was crazy, her punch pass was all used up so the bus driver threw it away per protocol, and about how it had already been documented three times. \n\nI went back off mute to tell her the issue was already documented and gave her the names of the agents she had actually talked with and she responded with, \"yeah, but it's been fifteen minutes and I haven't been given a new punch pass yet\". \n\nWhen I told her that she needed to go buy a new one and the bus driver wasn't just going to give her a new one, she went ballistic and I ended up transferring her over to our complaint department just so I wouldn't have to deal with her anymore. Which was kind of a shitty thing for me to do, I feel bad for whichever new agent got her, but it was already a ten minute phone call, (our average call time is just over a minute), and there was literally nothing else I could do for her. \n\nSince I've been typing this the agent right next to me got her again and is repeating the same cycle, (I handwrote her a note and passed it along telling her the situation, so now she's trying to get the crazy lady off the phone by explaining protocol AGAIN). What a wonderful start to an eight and a half hour shift :/ I really hope my center invests in some type of technology that blocks certain numbers, because we don't have that and have had some crazies call in. \n\nTL;DR: Call Centers have multiple agents and if you call back you're going to have to re-explain your situation to whoever the new person is, especially because my call center in particular doesn't have a note system because most of our calls are just general information calls and we don't handle accounts.

And other candidates have followed his lead with exaggerated figures, just not quite as high. Ben Carson claimed 200,000 from the Middle East “region” and 100,000 from Syria;  Fiorina said 100,000 from Syria.\n\n&gt; In fact, the planned number of Syrian refugees thus far is 10,000.

Our training was divided between customer service and sales support, with customer service being the majority of our training.

Would you look at that, isn't that nifty.\n\nKeep trucking through the set up, with her attempting to do both phones at the same time and them constantly timing out.\n\nTwo hours later both phones are active and I've had her make test calls from one to the other and taught her how to make calls.  She wanted me to program her bluetooth headset for her, but it wasn't charged and I informed her I couldn't stay on the line waiting for it to charge.  She mentioned she was going to the ----- store tomorrow and I let her know they would be happy to assist her in setting it up and scheduled an appointment for her.\n\nMy manager gets on the line to confirm that I've helped them.\n\nManager: Has Guy assisted you with this call?\n\nOL: No, this took way too long.  He didn't know what he was doing.\n\nManager: I'm sorry to hear that ma'am, how would you rate Guy on a scale of 1 to 10?\n\nOL: A 2, he was nice but he was stupid.\n\nManager: Thank you ma'am, you have a good day and thank you for calling ----- customer care.\n\nTwo hours and 47 minutes in total.\nMy manager was pissed at me, until he listened to the entire call.  Then he was just confused.  The lady had multiple times thanked me and confirmed that I had helped her as much as I could.",

        "text": "Hey, I've been lurking on reddit since I started this job and this is my first post ever on the website. I love the stories and already have stories to tell, but I guess this is just something I felt like I needed to talk about and get off my chest. If the format or subject in the post is wrong or anything I'm really sorry and will change it or do what ever to fix it.\n\nOk, so I just made a huge move from West Virginia to Michigan and it took me two months to get my new job at a major company that works with dispatching road services and what not. It's a lot different to me coming from working at fast food for two year to a call center environment, in fact it's my very first call center job. Training went very smoothly for me and my trainer actually sent a pretty nice email to the department talking about how prepared I am to start a career with the company, not just a job, so I felt very hopeful. Then here comes the week of mentoring, which went well also. My mentor was awesome, fast, and very friendly saying how well I'm doing and that I will catch on quickly. Finally I am now taking calls on my own...the first three days I was defeated, hated ever aspect of the job, wanted to cry, wanted to quite, it was the most horrible job I had ever experienced. I now have three weeks under my belt and while I don't want to cry the urge of quitting is still there. It's a slight struggle to show up to work and to put enthusiasm in my voice while trying to emphasize with the person on the other end knowing that they're going to yell at me because they will have to wait for a hour for their service....\nIt's just kind of becoming a loop of having ok days where it is slow, slightly peaceful, and people aren't as mean, to days with high call volumes, high estimated time quotes, and every one seems to have a major stick up their butts and they're just waiting for you to ask you to repeat something so they can immediately ask for a supervisor and have a reason to just start going off on you. I try not to let it bother me, I was really good at it at my last job kind of, but the amount that my heart beats when sitting down and hearing the whispering of the call offering voice is crazy, the people calling in are crazy, I just don't understand how some calls go the way that they do.\nI'm trying to stay strong and to leave work back at my cube, but it's really hard. I can't sleep well because I'm thinking back to my horrible calls wondering how I could fix it, what I screwed up, and when I'm going to be fired because quality control will finally crack and realize I'm doing a horrible job....\nI really want to do better, help every one out, and succeed in the company, I've been told it's an amazing place to make a career for yourself, but I feel like my days are numbered and I will get fired soon. How do you guys deal with this kind of stuff? Any tips and advice would be appreciated. \n\nAgain, this is my first post so I do apologize for any weird formatting or if I'm breaking any rules or anything. I also apologize for the long post of me complaining, I should just be happy to have a job that pays well, but I'm going crazy. I can't really talk to anyone about it at home since they won't understand and I just need to vent I guess.",

        "text": "Over the past couple years I've posted a few times here. Sometimes it was to vent sometimes it was because I found situations genuinely hilarious. Each time though, people here were able to understand and empathize and I really do appreciate that. It helped me make it through the last few years of a downward spiral at work.\n\nI mostly wanted to thank several of you whose names I forget now because it was months (a year or more for some...) that encouraged me to find a new job. Those people may not even frequent this sub anymore, but whatever. Plenty here know all too well the struggle.\n\nThe job I got laid off from (due to business closing its doors for good, hooray! fuck that place) was a small appliance parts place that also did repairs. So it was a lot of annoyingly small parts that were sometimes in stock sometimes not in stock but never accurately accounted for. Repair technicians that didn't speak much english/know how to operate a phone. \n\nTowards the end (well, ~3 of my 8 years there) I spent more time on reddit and facebook than I did working because I hadn't had a raise since my first year there. Commissions were killed my second year there (for sales on things like super automatic espresso machines and Miele vacuums), and 401K and whatnot were done away with a year or so prior to my arrival. The definition of a dead end job has a picture of my previous workplace.\n\nI fell into such a routine that most of my work was done in the first hour. Then it was just rote answering calls and e-mails throughout the day between reddit/facebook so people couldn't accuse me of daydreaming all day at my desk. \n\nIt sucked. So many people were jealous because I could be on reddit/facebook all day, but precious few understood why I wasn't thrilled about it. People here understood. People here were jealous too, and I don't blame you. If I were in that situation and couldn't fuck around online I probably would have ragequit life, honestly. I thought about it. Pay was meh. \n\nCommute costs ate up around $300 a month. I was in a situation where I couldn't quit because I was living paycheck to paycheck, even a 1 week lapse would screw me.\n\nWhen my daughter was born (she turns 6 in about a month) and I told my boss, his response was \"so... you'll be late today?\" To which I responded \"I'll be late about 48 hours.\" He threatened to fire me. I didn't answer my phone until we got out of the hospital and back home, and I wasn't fired yet so I went back to work after that. Was congratulated by coworkers, and told I'd be \"written up\" for not showing up as scheduled by my boss.\n\nI'm rambling. Fuckit. Beer does that to me I suppose.\n\nThank you for understanding the hell that is being entirely unappreciated at work.\n\nI wasn't able to find a new job before things tanked. But then I got laid off and had the time to go on as many day time interviews as I wanted. My fiancee (I call her my wife, we're not legally married yet but we've been together 8 years and have a daughter together... close enough) had been working for a while, so I *finally* had the ability to take a one week lapse in pay for EDD to kick in while I job searched. \n\nNow I've got a new job. It's still customer service, but it's a new field (after delivery support for a furniture company) and I'm mostly dealing with issues I can resolve. Like my table has a scratch on the top of it right after delivery, halp! Ok, send a tech out to touch it up or replace it if they raise a stink. Ezpz. \n\nAlso about 80% of it is e-mail, I'm in an office with one other person (she has been doing this for 30 years) and we take ~20 calls at the most in an 8 hour day. One day so far (been 3 weeks now) we had 0 phone calls.\n\nThis company does 20-30 million dollars worth of furniture sales in the area I'm in. There is a 401K with unlimited match I mean to take advantage of when I'm back stabilized financially. I took a small pay cut, but it costs me $30 a month in gas costs to get to/from work. That's a full zero cut off that expense, and makes the pay cut equal out. There is upward mobility, and a raise structure I plan to max out on each year.\n\nWhen I accepted the job I told my wife how happy I was, I slammed three beers, cried a little, and played video games all night. Then we went to Disneyland and did a gender reveal photo with a blue pumpkin for the son we're expecting in March.\n\nSo to all of you stuck in soul sucking shitholes: Keep your chin up and keep looking. If I hadn't been laid off, I would have found this job anyway since I was looking every damn day and the phone interviews were scheduled before/after normal working hours. Don't need to be laid off to find something better, but it sure made applying to ~30 places in a week pretty easy.\n\nSo thank you for allowing me to vent, and providing me things I could read and know that there are people out there that understand. I didn't realize how much it mattered until I escaped the death grip that shit hole had on me.",

        "text": "Okay, so. I work, or should I say, used to work, with an airline in Australia. (At an outsourced remove, since I am after all a Flippy agent, but that ain't important.)\n\nSee, I thought it was the big things that'd make me quit. In fact, back in August, it was Mount Raung spewing ash clouds that closed Ngurah Rai Airport (DPS) in Bali - and hence deluging us with calls from Aussies stranded there - that made me submit my resignation. (Among other things, but that's not here or there.)\n\nBut then I got loaned to the airline's customer care (read: complains) department, which we also look after. And I found that infinitely more refreshing that I actually asked for a transfer there, make it permanent. Which got approved!\n\nAnd I actually had an excellent time in training. It was lovely. It single-handedly convinced me to stay on. I was even aiming for trainer, as we have just the one trainer dedicated to that department and the poor dear has not taken a break since she took the post.\n\nAnd then another volcano nearby Bali decided to be troublesome. And for all that the work is reasonable, the schedule is unfortunate. It's still the same number of hours worked, but the transit time is the killer and I inevitably come home with no more mood than to just listen to music and sleep, and if I'm feeling ridiculously adventurous, maybe play Wesnoth.\n\nFeeling like a drone is not precisely conducive to also doing National Novel Writing Month.\n\nOver the weekend, for the above reasons and some personal ones, I vented my rage over into the void. Yesterday, I didn't come into work, still being non compos mentis from previous venting. Today I came into work. Not quite happy, but not rage-filled or depressed, either.\n\nSo I clocked in and booted up my tools. I look into my caseload.\n\nAnd then what does Flippy see? He sees one perfectly normal baggage query got sent back with a customer reply. Flippy blinks, because he knows he explained to the passenger why his 2.89m surfboard will not fit into a 2.77m baggage container. He knows he said to the passenger that it won't matter if he pays a hundred dollars, that isn't going to magically stretch the container. (Not in so many words, though.)\n\nWhat do I see on the notes on that case from the proofreader?\n\nShe deleted the explanatory paragraph about the baggage limits. Her grounds being that the passenger was 'just asking if he could check in his surfboard'. Which is perfectly true. However, it means that the passenger got an email that, instead of saying \"Sorry mate, no can do, and here's why\", he got an email that said \"Sorry mate, no can do\".\n\nSo basically, on grounds of irrelevance, one proofreader not only ruined first-response resolution but also effectively killed twenty minutes of my working day because I'd have to draft another email to him that I could use to work on other cases.\n\nAfter seeing that, I sent an email saying goodbye to my team leader, picked up my headset, and just walked out.\n\nGood bloody riddance.",

I could have sworn I paid that.\n\nAgent: Ummmm, It looks like we did miss it and we haven't received one this month.\n\nMe: Hmmm....(super long pause) Okay do you have my information on file?\n\nAgent: Bank account 1234 we have that on file.\n\nMe: no no no that is not right this is the right number \n\nRead her the exact same information she already has.\n\nAgent: There seems to be an issue and it says we cannot accept this information. (Obviously flustered) \n\nMe: See I told you!!! you already had my information just use the account you already have!!\n\nThis young lady you could tell she was shaking a bit more as I was pressing her.\n\nAgent: *stock payment disclosure* And you agree correct?\n\nMe: Yeah Sure whatever.\n\nI know she has to ask me if I want to set up a ACH auto withdraw monthly, been waiting for this part.\n\nAgent: I have this great program for you -cut her off-\n\nMe: I don't want any programs or anything that makes it sound like I can't pay my bill. (she wasn't supposed to call it a program)\n\nAgent:well *stammering at this point* I mean I think it would be a great option to try.\n\nMe:(I go deadpan on this) Do you really think I care what you think is a great option for me? Do you know how I spend my money are you snooping into my purchases?!?!\n\nAgent:No Si - cut her off - \n\nMe: Get.Me.Your.Manager.\n\nLong pause and she asks me to hold on\n\nManager: Hey Mr. Awesome I am a supervisor I hear you wanted to speak with me?\n\nMe: Awesome you came super quickly! Yes I sure did I just wanted to tell you that the previous agent was a god send, she helped me get my bill paid, took my late fee off and was super professional throughout the whole process, she is a keeper and I want to give my personal kudos to her over taking care of me. Is there anyway I can get her everytime I call in?!!?!\n\nSupervisor: Well that is great to hear, however we cannot do that *blahblahblah policy*\n\nMe: Okay well tell her she is awesome and I had an awesome experience, keep up the good work.\n\nI hung up and busted out laughing, I mind fucked that poor girl so badly.",

They're going to pay me (very) well and the company provides a service I'm very interested in.\n\nThe problem is the last call center I worked for fired me for being too rude on the phone. I don't mean to be rude; I won't pretend I wasn't a bit innerly contemptuous, but no matter how hard I tried to smile when I talked and be courteous, three warnings turned into, \"Perhaps you're just not right for this line of work.\"\n\nI applied almost exclusively for office management jobs and this one seemed to be one (it sort of is, really) until they described it more in detail and it turned out I was going to have to strap on the old headset again. They pointed out that this job can lead to better positions and greater responsibilities, but I'm terrified that history will repeat itself and I'll be out the door before that can happen.\n\nWhat secrets do you have to keeping your cool? Are any of you like me and seem to come off naturally curt? How did you overcome that? Is generic Xanax as good as the real stuff? Luckily this isn't necessarily a \"customer service\" job as much as it is fielding calls from professionals, but I'm worried my rude demeanor will rear its ugly head again.\n\nI appreciate any help.

        "text": "I  have been really relaxed in the past few weeks after quitting, and I left you all in the lurch.  I am here to deliver some more stories and an update.  (Say it with me....\"FREEDOM!!!!!\")  If you'd like some background on where I worked, see some of my previous posts on this.  I do not work there anymore!  Phew!\n\n**Update:**\nThe only worker left on my team has been given the position of QA.  This was a position that I was dying to get on.  No more phone calls, and just judging other agents on the phone.  I could do that, easily.  Or...another position, that I straight up was denied for.  So, she/he is still there and received a \"promotion\" of sorts off of Asshole TL's team.  Yay for her!  (They also stopped messing with her pay!)\n\nHubby is currently working for another at home call center.  The training was terrible...just imagine no training whatsoever and that was his training.  But, he's hanging in there and is officially on the call floor now.  I told him to keep an eye out for a higher paying, better job...just in case.  They don't pay him much and require sales out of him.  He's not a fan of doing sales, and I can't say that I blame him.\n\nI did return the computer back to the company.  I had to basically contact the US Department of Labor and let them know I had no idea where to send it.  They contacted the company for me, and actually received a response (after a month of silence when I tried to contact them).  I sent it back, no issues.  I also got a nice little cheque from them for some of my missing hours.  (That was quick!)  Seems like company just wanted me to escape into the night, and I was more than happy to oblige them.  It wasn't for ALL of the missing pay, but it was definitely helpful.\n\nOnto the stories!!!  (You might even notice a theme to some of these stories.)\n\n**Story #1:**\n\nThis was during the initial release date of a game, and these calls were plentiful.  I love game release days, don't you?  This is actually a common scam tactic that people use.  This call was taken the day of the release, and the caller was an older gentleman who was just (to put it plainly) obsessed with this game.  He knew way too much about it and was on the verge of a homicidal rage by the time he got onto my phone.\n\nHim:  I pre-ordered the game RacingCarGame and never received my carpack.  I want my cars!!! (insert random rage here about how awesome said car is...)\n\nMe:  I understand.  Let's take a look at your account and figure out what happened to your carpack.\n\nI looked at his account.  He actually DID pre-order the game...but then he cancelled the pre-order 24 hours before activating the \"normal\" version of the game (most likely went to GameStop and bought the hard cd instead).  This means, technically he never pre-ordered it and yes he received a refund for his preorder long before speaking to me.  What he did was pre-order it, cancel the pre-order hoping that the system wouldn't notice and still send him the codes to use for the free cars, and then went out and bought a cheaper version of the game so he could save himself roughly $30.00 (while still keeping the cars that ONLY come with the ultimate edition).  What he didn't know was that I can see everything that he did, and no they won't send you the codes for the free things if you cancel your pre-order.  Sorry.\n\nMe: Sir, it looks like at one time you did pre-order the game -gets cut off-\n\nHim: Yeah! I told you!  WHERE ARE MY CARS?!?!?!?!\n\nMe:  ...but then you cancelled the pre-order and activated a hard disc cd copy of it.  So, you wouldn't be receiving the codes for the cars with the version that you actually bought and put onto your console. The carpack is only available for the ultimate edition, and you don't have the ultimate edition.  (Hard message delivered successfully!)\n\nHim:  That's not possible!  I am staring at my receipt right now that says I pre-ordered it, but I don't have the codes to activate my cars!  GET IT FOR ME NOW!!!  I KNOW YOU HAVE CODES SITTING AROUND AND I WANT MY CODE!  (I am unsure why people think this...because it's wholly untrue.  I don't have random codes sitting on my desk.)\n\nMe:  I do not have codes sitting around to give out to people.  I can tell you that if you wanted to upgrade the verison of the game to the correct version that you get the carpack with, you can return the original game back to where you bought it from and buy the Ultimate Edition instead...or you can try contacting the publisher and seeing if you can just pay the difference for an upgraded version instead.\n\nHim:  I am not happy with that solution, little missy!  You will fix this immediately!\n\nMe:  Unfortunately, I cannot give you a free carpack when you do not have the correct version of the game.  You'd need to have the ultimate edition in order to have access to the carpack.\n\nHe went into a wonderful rage about how my customer service skills are lacking, and how I should just give him the carpack willy nilly because he said so...then he hung up.  I did get to mention to him that I could see that the original pre-order was refunded by himself, and he acted like it never should have been refunded.  I did ask him where he got his game from (GameStop) and why he would feel the need to buy the original version of the game if he truly he pre-ordered it.  Which then lead him into some lies that I could easily see through.  (His account was later flagged by another agent for him trying to scam the other agent)\n\n**Story #2:**\n\nIt was not uncommon for people to call in numerous times to try to receive refunds or credits onto their accounts, when a previous agent told them no.  For this call, the man had actually spoken to 13 other agents before me (in one day, that is impressive).  Some were chat agents and some were on the phone.  He started with the chat agents, and when the chat agents \"messed up\" (made a minor false promise) he would then use that on the call agents or if they told him no - he prayed another agent would ignore the previous notes and try to scam the new agent (or he was just phishing for information on our policies, etc).  This is actually a normal scam tactic, but when you speak to chat agents - their entire chat is posted into their notes (the ENTIRE chat).\n\nSo, he's on my phone and seems genuinely happy to speaking me (yay!  no angry customer!)  I saw the notes from the previous agents after loading up his account and panicked a bit.  It was a mess.  Imagine an apocalypse just happened in my system, because that's what loaded up for me.  The account was a mess of notes and I had to quickly sort through and read them all.\n\nHim:  I never received my code for ShooterGame.  I ordered the game and never got my email for the download.\n\nMe:  I have looked all over your account and I do not see any record of you buying that game.  Is there another account it might be on?  I have gone all the way back over a year, and it's not listed on this account.\n\nHim:  I spoke to someone else and they told me that because of YOUR error that I will get a token.  (This is a term that is ONLY used by our agents, and is a red flag.  This is a MASSIVE warning that a person is a scammer and we are warned about it multiple times a week.  We are to NEVER use this term with customers or you will be fired on the spot, immediately.)\n\nMe: *suddenly really concerned about the word used* I can take a look through all of your previous notes and find out if they did send you a code to your email.  Would you mind hanging out with me for a bit while I do that?  (Cannot put people on hold, I start random rapport as I look for the agent that REALLY screwed the pooch...  Oh crap!  It was a chat agent, and they physically typed it in their email to him WITH the code - I can see the email they sent!  SOB!  I now have to contact my Asshole TL and report this agent for a massive breach in protocol.)\n\nHim:  Well, they sent me an email with a code but I lost the email.  (Yes, email and code was sent.  1- He didn't deserve this code, he was a scammer and his original issue was he never actually bought the game.  Not our fault, his.  2- Since it was promised by another agent, I had to honor that promise (though my TL disagreed with this).  3- He had already used the code before contacting me)\n\nMe:  Well, let's check your email right now while you're on the phone with me and try to use it.\n\nHe checks his email, magically the code is there.  Before now, he was demanding a new code to be sent out.  Nope, not gonna give you two codes.  You were lucky to get one.  Went to plug it in, yup...error already used.  I check the code on the account, again, has been applied to the correct account.\n\nHim:  Oh okay, so it was used!  Well, your agent also promised me a code for FreeReallyExpensiveGame. (remember kiddies:  he originally claimed he didn't speak to anyone, and then suddenly he did...and now he's talking about yet another agent he spoke with.)\n\nMe:  According to the notes I am seeing on your account, this was never promised to you and I have never heard of anyone being able to offer that to someone. We aren't actually in the sales department and would have no access to ReallyExpensiveGame code to download.  I also checked your account, and other agents have told you numerous times that we cannot give you ReallyExpensiveGame code to download the game and that they told you that you had never bought OriginalShooterGame.  (Mind you, TL is now listening to the call because I had to honor that promise...so hard message and stonewalling on my part needed to be done)\n\nHim:  Your company is lucky that I am still a costumer!!  -click-\n\nI am fairly certain he tried to call back in again and scam another agent.  I had to flag the account for multiple attempts to scam, since he tried multiple times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, I guess what we learned today is:  agents are warned about scammers and I came across quite a few.  I'd say about 1/5 calls was someone trying to either learn our policies about refunds (to know how many and how much per month/year could be refunded) or try to get things for free.\n\n**Random Goodness:**\n\nAround 11pm on a weeknight, I received a call from a sobbing woman.  She had recently gone through a divorce and her son couldn't play his console.  It was receiving an error message that basically meant the hard drive had been removed.  I explained this to her and her response was epic (in my mind).\n\nHer:  That dirty rotten bastard was just over here, and I saw him messing with it!  I didn't even know it had a storage thingie on there!  I'm going to chew him out over this big time!  I can't believe he would do that to his own son!!!\n\nMe:  If you wanted you can actually buy a new one online from either our store or even from Amazon and it should work just as well.  They are pretty cheap for this system, and if it doesn't work when you buy it off of Amazon...they have a great loyalty program that will allow you to return it and get a refund.  I know it's not ideal, but this way you don't need to speak to your ex.\n\nHer:  *instantly all smiles*  That is a fantastic idea!  I won't let him into my house again, he's just punishing our son right now because of me and it's not right.  Thanks so much for the advice!\n\nThis call later turned into a kudos call because I was very patient and understanding.  She later forwarded an apology to me through the supervisor that she was sorry for \"flying off the handle and crying so much\".",

So if someone needs to pay their trash bill, or doesn't get picked up one week, or any of the other 20 million things that can happen, they call in and we help them fix the issue. Normally, everything works relatively well. However, the past few weeks there have been a couple issues building off each other and it's starting to grind.\n\nThe first issue is that since this job can have it's bad areas, we have a lot of people either quitting or just deciding to stop showing up. Usually this is balanced out by having frequent training classes to bring in new people, but the last training class for my center was back in June... 6 months ago. Because of that, we're at a point where there are ridiculously few agents working on any given day.\n\nThat brings us to the second issue, which isn't one that most people on this subreddit would complain about, but our call volume is incredibly low as well, which is why new agents are not being hired.\n\nBring these two issues together, and you get to the final problem. Right now, there is no room for advacement that I can see. When everything is running smoothly, you have the chance of either becoming one of the people responsible for answering other agent questions and helping the new people, or being the person who gets to take the escalated 'i want a soophavisa' calls, if that is more your style. However since no one is being hired, no one is being promoted, which means being stuck as a normal tier-1 agent, no matter your stats.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: No room for advancement, no matter what.",

Most people are alright when we call, we can usually find something affordable and take the admin costs off if they really want to pay up front. \n\nOne of the accounts I had been chasing belonged to a Solicitor who was very intent that I knew about his degree. For some background information, previous to starting my business degree and qualifications, I had done law but gave up because of how boring it is. I was good at law but I knew it wasn't for me. \n\nThe outstanding debt was 3,000 in property taxes which were passed to us by a real-estate firm that had been chasing this guy for a while. It had been passed to me due to the fact that I can deal with business matters better than most of my colleagues who are from the old generation of debt collection which is essentially bashing down doors and taking items.\n\nI get a call from his office stating that I am to stop all communications to him. I kindly tell them that I cannot discuss anything due to data protection. They get mad and try to go off on one, I disconnect the call once against stating that I cannot discuss anything by law. This makes me happy. \n\nI get a call from him directly, giving auth to his office. He states that what I am doing is illegal. I inform him that we have all authority under law to chase him for this. \n\nHe goes on a massive ego drive. He informs me that due to his status of being a solicitor that I should take his word for this not being lawful. Our legal dept had checked it and essentially deemed his reason for not paying to be legal under Scottish law, which the contract he had signed was signed under English law which was clearly defined as being the active law at time of signing and therefore the Scottish law sections were completely void. \n\nI inform him he can either pay or he can go to court, and I am very gracious in telling that we wouldn't be footing the bill for that. \n\nHe once again tries to make me feel small by suggesting I know nothing about the law, and that his status some how makes a difference. My last words before sending it to our legal team was \"Well sir, just like the law operates with everyone being equal, so does this collection firm. I suppose we'll need to see you in court then.\"",

He comes through to my department, and the following conversation ensues:\n\nME: Hi there, am I speaking with X?  \nCX: THAT'S MR X TO YOU.   \n*ME, INTERNALLY: oh joy, you're a complete wanker*  \nME: My apologies, Mr X, how can I assist you tod-  \nCX: I shouldn't have to pay this rate change!   \nME: I'm sorry?   \nCX: I shouldn't have to pay the new rates!   \nME: ... Sir, the rate change affects everyone in your state as of the first of July.   \nCX: YES, but I was AWAY.   \nME: Away?   \nCX: YES. I was OUT OF THE COUNTRY from the 24th of June until AFTER this billing period ends! So I should only have to pay the OLD rates.   \n*ME, INTERNALLY: are you fucking kidding me*  \nME: Sir, are you aware that your gas meter is only read once every three months?   \nCX: Of course I am!   \nME: So our meter readers have no way of knowing on which dates the gas was used. It's a pro-rata average of your daily usage.   \nCX: BUT I WAS AWAY   \nME: Did you call us to tell us that?  \nCX: Of course not!   \nME: Then how can you expect the meter readers to know that?   \nCX: I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE NEW RATES. I WASN'T THERE.   \nME: ... okay. So, you were away from the 24th, correct? And this billing period ends on the 3rd of July.   \nCX: SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY TH-   \nME: Sir, what I'm trying to do is work out the difference in what you paid and what you seem to feel you should have paid. Do you mind if I place you on hold while I do some quick calculations?   \n\nI put the guy on hold and work it out. The difference comes to... $1.49 total. On a $400+ bill. Fuckening hell.\n\nME: So the total difference comes to a dollar forty-nine, which we'd be happy to apply as a goodwill credit.   \nCX: THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, I WANT HALF THE BILL WAIVED FOR YOUR INCOMPETENCE.   \nME: Sir, I don't appreciate being called incompetent and I have to warn you if you continue to insult me I will terminate this call. We can't authorise a credit of half your bill - that would be over $200, and as the amount of your bill is correct, we wouldn't apply a credit of that amount. The charges you're disputing come to $1.49. We're happy to credit *that* amount.   \nCX: BUT I WAS OVERSEAS. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THESE CHARGES.   \nME: And we're happy to waive them.   \nCX: I want half the bill waived or I'll see you in court!!  \n*ME, INTERNALLY: mmmhmmm, sure you will*   \nME: Well I'm sorry you feel that way, but a credit of $1.49 is all we can approve in this instance.   \n\nHappily, he hung up then. Probably wisely, I chose not to point out to him that it costs about that per minute to call our centre, and so he wasted about 19 times what he was disputing calling to complain about it. ",

        "text": "ISP tech - rant ensuing.\n\na customer (Cx) calls in complaining of an issue, doing the basic diagnostic troubleshooting i determine it's his equipment, i offer to setup a field tech to come out but the available times for the tech do not fit with the cx and he ends up requesting we mail him out the equipment instead. important thing to note here is i can't 100% confirm which part of his equipment is faulty since my diagnostic tool doesn't look at the individual parts of his network. i inform his as such and explain that the department (customer service) that normal handles mail outs is currently closed, and recommend he call back tomorrow morning when they open, he's entirely ok with this and i start doing my closing statement only to have a co-worker (\"we\") (QA agent, who's not even my direct boss or even in a higher position then me but oh because we've been here longer we seem to think we know everything?) come rushing over from across the call floor screaming \"place him on hold place him on hold!\" oookk... -holds- \"we can totally set up the mail out's but i don't remember how\" mumbles to self for about 3 minutes while i'm basicly visually showing and audibly instructing on how to do a mail out and giving the general impression that not only do i KNOW how to do it, but that i've also tried, failed due to system issues i can't fix, and also don't feel like sending my AHT sky high to fix an issue that's not my problem anyway and that they customer is entirely ok with calling back to resolve.\nyeah no, \"we\" finally remember how to set up a mail out after yelling back and forth with the helpdesk &amp; supervisor sitting further down the row of cubicles  and then insists on doing it themself, insisting i move myself away from the computer so that \"we\" can attempt to setup a mail out, meanwhile customer has been on hold for 10 minutes and at this point not being near the hold button, i can't take him off hold and let him know i haven't forgetting about him or just trying to waste time till i'm off work., 15 on hold, 16...18, he hangs up...eventually \"we\" determines issue is unresolvable with my access so \"we\" try to fix it by going to our computer with higher access (which \"we\" don't have ) 30 minutes (i've put myself on code now under order from \"we\", without much protest because hey, i don't mind getting paid to watch other people stick their nose in peoples business and make an ass of themselves, and if anybody tries to come down on my ass i just need to point to \"we\" and the several eye witness colleagues that have been watching this unfold (and yes i have popcorn too yumyum :3 )) and issue still isn't resolved, eventually after 45 minutes i'm instructed to phone the people who can fix the issue (and wake them up), they fix it in about 2 minutes and i am able to call my customer back (now an hour since he called, and 48 minutes since i tried told him to call back tomorrow) but not before \"we\" can put in their further 2 cents worth of opinion and \"show me how it's done proper\" because apparently me not touching anything why other departments fix things is entirely doing it wrong. an hour after the CX hung up i'm finally able to call him back explain the situation and that i've got the mail out setup. \"we\" is now off work, and has been for  about 20 minutes. \ntalk about work avoidance &gt;.&gt;... i almost hope the higher ups try to come down on me for call avoidance, but saddly, i know they won't...(they're kind of lax about that sort of thing)\nit's incredibly infuriating that \"we\" has to stick their nose so far into my shit i'm getting a sore throat, BUT karma is a bitch and i have 101 passive agressive ways to help it slowly progress down it's due course....it will be fun :)",

        "text": "The word of the day is inept, brought to you by the cotton-eared motherfucker I just got off the phone with.\n\nI work in customer service for a homebuilder. I don’t mind our homeowners. I’d say 85% of them are normal human beings with basic, pertinent questions and problems that I can solve, or figure out how to solve. Everyone else, that last measly 15%, comprised of rude, entitled, brainless, irritating homeowners - those fuckers just need to die.\n\nTake Jerry, for instance. This man clearly never learned to use his ears. Or his eyes. Or his brain. \n\n&gt;Joe Schmoe Homebuilder Warranty Services, this is Hyde. How can I help you? \n\n(Note the clear identification of the company and my name.)\n\n&gt;Uh … is this Joe Schmoe Homebuilder?\n\n&gt;…Yeeees?\n\n&gt;Oh, great, okay. Who am I speaking to?\n\n&gt;… Marsha.\n\nHe had a simple enough request: paint colors. Sure. No problem. I can do that. Simple. Except …\n\n&gt;Where are you located, sir?\n\n&gt;Uhm, right now, I’m in my kitchen.\n\n&gt;… That’s great, sir, but I meant what is your address.\n\n&gt;Oh. \n\nSilence. I let it get as awkward as possible.\n\n&gt;Sir?\n\n&gt;Huh?\n\n&gt;Your address?\n\n&gt;OH. You need me to GIVE it to you. Let me go find it.\n\nLet you go find it? After a few minutes, he manged to find a piece of mail with the address on it, and read it to me. I found him in the system and almost groaned aloud. Our records indicate that you’ve lived there for thirteen years … and you don’t know your address?\n\n&gt;Okay, sir, give me one moment to find the color scheme for your lot.\n\nI put him on hold and mentally eviscerated him while I searched. Moments later I had the document. All of the codes were neatly listed, and the paint brand was noted in at least seven places. I took the phone off hold.\n\n&gt;Hello, sir. I found your color scheme. May I please have your email address so I can send it to you?\n\n&gt;Whoa, that took like … thirty minutes.\n\nI blinked. My active call time read 8 minutes, 13 seconds.\n \n&gt;We haven’t even been on the phone for *ten* minutes, sir.\n\n&gt;… Oh. Well, what is the color?\n\n&gt;Excuse me?\n\n&gt;Didn’t you say you found the color?\n\n&gt;I found the color scheme for your home, yes.\n\n&gt;Okay, cool.\n\n Silence. I ground my teeth a little.\n\n&gt;… May I have your email address, so I can send the color scheme to you?\n\n&gt;You can’t just read it to me?\n\n&gt;……… Nnnnooooo, I cannot.\n\n&gt;Why?\n\n&gt;It’s a full page of paint codes, sir. There is no efficient way to give you out-of-context information from a grid.\n\n&gt;Uhm … okay. What if I can’t read it? \n\n*Tough shit, twatwaffle.*\n\n&gt;Sir, are you going to buy paint for your house?\n\n&gt;Uh, yes?\n\n&gt;Then the employees who sell you paint will be able to read it to you.\n\n&gt;Oh. Okay.\n\nSilence. I knew I would not be able to keep the impatience out of my voice, so I didn’t try.\n\n&gt;Can. I. Please. Have. Your. Email. Address. Sir.\n\n&gt;Huh? Oh, right. It’s tinydickmoron@canthearyou.com.\n\nI confirmed the email address.\n\n&gt;Yeah, that’s it. What was your name again?\n\n&gt;Kelsey.\n\n&gt;Okay. And you’re sure it’s the color for the yellow house, right?\n\n&gt;… They will read the paint codes at the hardware store, sir.\n\n&gt;Oh. You can’t just - \n\n&gt;Thank you. I will send this immediately.\n\nAnd without saying goodbye, or ‘have a nice day’, or any pleasant thing whatsoever, I mashed the end call button. My IQ was dropping so fast speaking with that idiot, I was afraid to expend the energy.\n\nI sent the email, and continued working. Twenty minutes later, I nearly bit my lip off in frustration as an email notification with his name popped up.\n\n&gt;Hi Natalie,   (&lt;—- FOR REAL?) What do the codes refer to? What is the paint brand used? What is the little number 5 in front of the codes? Thanks, Jerry\n\ntl;dr: AAARRGHHH.",
