[{"title":"Happy Birthday AskReddit!","author":"-eDgAR-","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10kzboh\/happy_birthday_askreddit\/","text":"[Time to celebrate!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XcYQ1dm.gif)\n\nThat's right, January 25, 2023 marks the 15 anniversary of the creation of this wonderful community. Some of you might remember 5 years ago, for our 10th anniversary, we had [a t-shirt design contest](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/7gurqh\/announcing_a_very_special_contest\/) to celebrate (ignore the date on that, we goofed up back then). From the many amazing submissions, we had [a community vote between 7 of the best](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/7nf0xk\/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th) for the one to be featured on a shirt that would raise money for a charity that was later [voted on too.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/7oyhb5\/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th)\nFollowing that, we teamed up with \/u\/mrscrankshaft from CustomInk and ran [a fundraising campaign](https:\/\/www.customink.com\/fundraising\/askreddit-10th-anniversary-collection) where you could purchase two designs on various products or just donate directly and together we raised $3,621 for Doctors Without Borders\/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) International through sales and donations.\n\nWell, we've decided that we are going to do it all again for this milestone! Later today the new design contest will go live and in the following weeks the community will be voting on the best designs, a charity to support, and finally ending with another fundraising campaign like we did 5 years ago.\n\nIn the meantime, **we invite you to use this post to share some of your favorite AskReddit moments from the past 15 years.**\n\nThank you all for making this one of the best communities on Reddit,\n\n- The \/r\/AskReddit moderators","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674655389.0},{"title":"AskReddit's 15th anniversary t-shirt design contest","author":"-eDgAR-","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10lfd5w\/askreddits_15th_anniversary_tshirt_design_contest\/","text":"This is the official thread to submit your designs for this contest, so post your submission as a top-level comment here. \n\nThis contest will remain open for a month and will conclude on **February 21st, 2023 at 7pm CT**, so you have until then to submit a design. Following that the mods will choose from designs that we feel best fit the spirit of the sub, similar to how we did 5 years ago for [our 10th anniversary contest](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/7gurqh\/announcing_a_very_special_contest\/), and the community will vote on those designs. For reference [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/7nf0xk\/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th) are the designs that were voted on back then and [here](https:\/\/www.customink.com\/fundraising\/askreddit-10th-anniversary-collection) is the fundraising campaign were we raised $3,621 for Doctors Without Borders\/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) International through sales and donations.\n\nThe winner of the best design will receive a free shirt and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place will receive a special community award that will give them 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year of Reddit Premium respectively. \n\n\n**A few guidelines to consider:**\n\n* Please no NSFW designs (sorry that means no cumboxes)\n\n* Please keep designs limited to one side (either front or back)\n\n* Please have the images be as high resolution as possible and CustomInk has requested the image be vectored if possible. These are the accepted file types: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .pdf, .ai and .psd\n\n\n* Please avoid using anything that is trademarked, except for Snoo. We will work with the admins to get permission for the final design.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what this community comes up with!\n\n\\- The \/r\/AskReddit Moderators","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674695207.0},{"title":"What industry do you hope won't exist in 10 years?","author":"filetemyoung","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10wtgtt\/what_industry_do_you_hope_wont_exist_in_10_years\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675852749.0},{"title":"What\u2019s something that tastes better burnt?","author":"FlintTheDad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10xej6m\/whats_something_that_tastes_better_burnt\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675898951.0},{"title":"People Who Never Dated in High School: Is there something that you feel like you missed out on or lack now that you are older?","author":"AdEconomy501","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10xloik\/people_who_never_dated_in_high_school_is_there\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675917983.0},{"title":"What's a famous product that is a complete scam?","author":"Leather-College2557","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10ww9zs\/whats_a_famous_product_that_is_a_complete_scam\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675861739.0},{"title":"What are some \"rich people\" sports?","author":"Guilhermedidi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10x7cy5\/what_are_some_rich_people_sports\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675882339.0},{"title":"What was a huge trend everyone forgot about?","author":"broadway96","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10x8omz\/what_was_a_huge_trend_everyone_forgot_about\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675885510.0},{"title":"What is the most addictive drink?","author":"iloko1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10xi8tk\/what_is_the_most_addictive_drink\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675908304.0},{"title":"Redditors born before 1990: What was your opinion of Michael Jackson in his heyday, and what are your opinions of him today?","author":"TheFleshlightAnthem","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/10xntez\/redditors_born_before_1990_what_was_your_opinion\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1675924832.0},{"title":"Pee-Can, Pee-Kahn, Puh-Can or Puh-Kahn?
