Hence symbolic; DOJ must act independently and decide on its own evaluation whether it has evidence to pursues any charges.\n\nHowever, there is no prohibition against the DOJ to evaluate any evidence that the Panel may have uncovered. In the past \\[June 2022\\] DOJ even accused the Panel of a “failure” to share its 1,000 witness transcripts.\n\n[Tensions escalate as DOJ renews request for Jan. 6 panel transcripts - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/16/tensions-escalate-as-doj-renews-request-for-jan-6-panel-transcripts-00040267)\n\nThe Committee referral to DOJ includes charges against Trump. Panel alleges Trump violated federal criminal statutes and committed the crimes of insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the federal government and making a false statement.  \\[Specifically, the charges that subcommittee proposes for Trump: 18 U.S.C. 2383, insurrection; 18 U.S.C. 1512(c), Obstruction of an official proceeding; and 18 U.S.C. 371, Conspiracy to defraud the United States government and Conspiracy to Make a False Statement 18 U.S.C. 371, 1001\\]\n\nAs noted, the Justice Department has pursued its own investigation regarding the January 6, event and it may, if it so wishes, make an independent evaluation of the evidence discovered by the Panel.\n\nIs DOJ likely to find useful information and how that may impact its decision on whether to pursue charges against Trump, if any?",

Kosovo’s statehood has been accepted by the U.S. and much of the West. Serbia and its allies Russia and China have rejected it and have blocked Kosovo from joining the U.N. and other international institutions.\n\nA few days earlier tensions soared in northern Kosovo after unknown attackers exchanged gunfire with police and threw a stun grenade at European Union officers overnight.\n\nAnimosity mounted after Kosovo scheduled local elections in four ethnic Serb-majority municipalities in the north for December 18, with the main Serb political party saying it would stage a boycott.\n\nExplosions and shootings were heard earlier this week as election authorities tried to prepare the ground for the vote, while an ethnic Albanian policeman was wounded after law enforcement was deployed in the region.\n\nHundreds of ethnic Serbs, outraged over the arrest of a former police officer, gathered early last Sunday at roadblocks they erected the previous day, paralyzing traffic at two border crossings from Kosovo towards Serbia.\n\nSerbian officials claim that the NATO and European Union-led peacekeeping missions are unable to protect the minority Serbs in Kosovo from harassment by majority Kosovo Albanians and that their security forces can do the job.\n\nAside from requesting authorization from NATO to send its own troop to Kosovo \\[which it expects to be denied\\], Serbia also raised combat readiness of its troops on the border with Kosovo and warned it would not stand by if Serbs in Kosovo, who make up less than 10% of Kosovo’s population, are attacked.\n\nIs Putin possibly pushing for another open front involving Kosovo backed by NATO and Serbia, backed by Moscow?",
