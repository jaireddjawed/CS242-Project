The shop boss (a scatterbrained and somewhat spineless guy) thought that I was going to be the new boss until we figured out that he outranked me by \"time in grade\" - we were the same rank, but he held his rank a year earlier than did I.  So he was the boss.\n\nHe was also going through a very messy divorce.  He caught his wife cheating on him and was heartbroken and bewildered, but his civilian wife had become extremely vicious and was trying to get him in trouble.  Her boyfriend was a military cop (MP), and she tried using that against my boss until the military caught on and put a stop to it.\n\nSo I had only been there for a couple of days, and was alone in the shop doing paperwork when the shop phone rang.\n\n\"Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you're the new NCOIC (shop boss for the civilian folks).  Jim (Staff Sergeant Bewildered) told me you are going to be in charge!  I need you to make him do something for me.\"\n\n\"Sorry, no, Staff Sergeant Bewildered is still the shop boss.  He outranks...\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't.  Why are you covering for him?\"\n\n\"We just figured it out yesterday ma'am, he out..\"\n\n\"NO!  YOU are his boss,\" she yelled.  \"And YOU need to tell him to let me the fuck into our house!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, but he's my boss, and I won't get involved in his private life.\"\n\n\"You're an asshole and you're lying for ...\" CLICK.\n\nI'd hung up the phone.\n\nThe phone rang.\n\n\"Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how...\"\n\n\"YOU ASSHOLE, WHY THE FUCK..\"  CLICK\n\nI hung up the phone again.\n\nThe phone rang.\n\n\"Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant... \"\n\n**\"GOD DAMMIT YOU FUCK...\"**  CLICK.\n\nI had hung up the phone again.\n\nThere was a noticeable pause.\n\nThe phone rang.\n\n\"Bla Squadron, Staff Sergeant Calladus, this line may be unsecured, how can I help you?\"\n\nHer very quiet, and somewhat contrite voice said, \"Why do you keep hanging up on me?\"\n\n\"Ma'am this is a military phone line for military business.  I'm not required to listen to an abusive civilian who has nothing to do with my job.  So any cursing will immediately end this phone call.  Speaking to me is your privilege, not your right.\"\n\nShe started to say something, but I just bulldozed over her.\n\nMa'am, I don't know you and you don't know me, but you've accused me of being a liar to protect your husband from you.  Frankly, I don't care one way or the other.  What is true is that he DOES outrank me by a year in grade, and will remain the shop boss unless something changes.\"\n\n\"You are not in my chain of command, ma'am, so even if I did outrank your husband, I would not order him to do anything for you because that would be unlawful and unethical.\"\n\n\"I don't give a damn about what is going on between the two of you, and since I'm not anyone's friend here I won't lift a finger to help either of you solve your personal problems.  As long as his personal life doesn't get in the way of his Air Force duties, or break the laws of the UCMJ, then **I. Just. Don't. Care.**\"\n\n\"Now get off my phone.  I have work to do.\"\n\nAnd I hung up again.\n\nShe spent the next year trying to fuck up his life, and almost succeeded, but a judge saw through the crap and awarded him full custody of their children, with supervised visits only by her.  He wasn't a great leader, but he was adequate.  And she was such a bitch!\n\nAnd she never said more than a sentence or two to me for the rest of my time at that assignment.",

        "text": "So I used to work as a manufacturing engineer for a security manufacturer.  I got the job fresh out of the Air Force, and even though I started as a technician, within the first six months I had won Employee of the Month and had been promoted to \"associate manufacturing engineer\".\n\nIt was a great company, I loved working there and I really respected and enjoyed working with my coworkers and my bosses.  \n\nBut there was this one guy...\n\nI worked as a non-degreed engineer trainee, and they needed someone with experience and training to design automated test systems.  I was doing that with embedded processors and with ATE systems, but the company wanted an \"ultimate tester\", and hired an engineer.  He was personable, easy to get along with, and extremely intelligent.  He knew his shit.\n\nHe was also pretty damned lazy.\n\nI worked at this company for 9 months - total.  During the time I worked there we were sold on three different occasions.  The first two times we were sold, I hardly noticed.  Life went on as normal.  The third time we were sold, all of management came out wearing their best suits to tell us that nothing would change.  \n\nSome of these people I had never seen wearing a suit before.  So naturally I polished up my resume, and sent out 50 copies a week and starting going to interviews.\n\nDuring this time, we had been having problems with our engineer.  Parts were missing, project dates were missed.  He fell asleep at his desk.  It got pretty bad.  My boss, (also this guy's manager) talked to me and we both admitted this guy was a mistake to work with.  \n\nThe company started letting him go, but somehow he got in good with the plant manager, who overruled my manager and kept him on.\n\nSome of the automatic test equipment we used had the ability to use passwords and multiple accounts.  There were administration privileges.  Someone once locked themselves out, and my boss and I figured out how to trick the system into unlocking itself.  \n\nSo I left that company just as it was starting to reduce it's workforce in preparation of having the company gutted and the pieces scattered around the country.  I let everyone know that I had a new job lined up, and where I would be living and working.\n\nI ended up at a new manufacturing company.  And a month after I got there, I got a call at my desk from my old plant manager asking me for the passwords to several test systems.  I gave him the passwords I used to use, but they did not work.\n\nI then told him that my old boss knew how to break in and get around the passwords.  But I was informed that he had quit after a dispute with the plant manager over the lazy engineer.  (I later found out that he found a job on the East Coast at a nice pay raise.  Good for him!)\n\nI then mentioned that perhaps the lazy engineer had those passwords.\n\nLong sigh from the plant manager - lazy engineer was fired, but out of the goodness of his heart, and for a large consultant fee, lazy engineer could probably figure out how to \"break in\".  Of course lazy engineer had no clue what the passwords were to these systems... \n\nI have no idea what happened after that call, but I think lazy engineer had figured a way to get another paycheck out of that company.\n\nTL;DR: Of course I don't know the passwords to your system, but maybe if you pay me, I can hack it.",

It shows here you actually owe us 345 dollars more due to not filling up to the correct amount and leaving the equipment filthy and the extra equipment that you rented but we never got back.

(cuts me off AGAIN screaming nonsense that I DGAF about at this point I try and cut her off and say Ma'am she ignore it so after a few time.. I, in an extremely loud manner say MA'AM!! JUST LISTEN, STOP TALKING! So she stops...) \n\nL:Even if you did go to the place and show statement of double charge you would not get the charge back, they would keep that charge and you will still owe the remaining balance that you owe us.

        "text": "I had a job one summer working for an organization that goes door to door seeking donations for various causes - usually environmental ones but other stuff too.  Like everyone else, I ended up working there only because I hadn't planned ahead better and this place would hire pretty much anyone (though there were a few people there who I'd call True Believers who thought they were singlehandedly saving the world by doing this job).  \n\nThe job was from 4ish to 9ish we'd go door to door and ask for donations.  We'd also sign people upfor our mailing list.  You had to bring in a minimum of $500/week to get paid $300/week.  Anything over that you got 35% of, anything under that and you'd only get 35% of it (so if you brought in $400, you get paid $140).  For most of us this meant that once you hit $500 for the week (which you could on Thursday or Wednesday) you could slack off and goof around.\n\nIt wasn't awful as far as summer jobs went as long as you didn't mind the weather or harassing strangers all day everyday.  Usually you'd knock on 70-100 doors and maybe get 10ish people to donate.  I saw some weird shit there because, of course, you were just knocking on random peoples doors interrupting what they were doing.  I had some of the expected stuff - getting sworn at, cursed out, offered food drinks and illegal substances, but a few stories stick out.\n\n-I had a guy talk to me from behind the door with his head sticking through the crack.  He didn't want to donate so I offered him a pamphlet.  He told me to leave it on the step because he \"forgot to bring clothes to the door\".  Had another lady talk to me through the front window because she wasn't wearing pants cause she couldn't afford to run the AC.  She ended up donating.\n\n-One lady invited me in and pointed me to her living room.  We weren't supposed to go into people's houses, but everyone did cause it was hot.  I fixed her cable box before she realized I wasn't the cable guy.  She gave me $50 (because she could cancel her service call).\n\n- Some guy walking his cat saw me talking to his neighbor and afterward insisted I follow him home (was only a few houses down).  He asked me all sorts of questions for over an hour (normally, even if someone donated it was under 10 minutes).  I covered literally everything in our pamphlets three times and out of nowhere he's just like \"Ok I'll get my checkbook\" and writes a check for $70.  Still no idea what I said.\n\n-Had a coworker leave because she was saw in a psychic vision that we would all be flooded in  storm - she moved to Florida and after that would send us postcards addressed from her cats.\n\n-A lady found out that I was going to the same college as her daughter in the fall and gave me her daughters number and then took down mine.  She actually was pretty cool and we hung out some in college.\n\n-Acting out our spiel for the numerous people who didn't speak English.  Yeah you try charades-ing \"climate change' and \"sea level rise\".\n\n-All time favorite:  Knocked on some guy's door and he comes out and invites me to sit on his enclosed porch.  We're talking a bit and I notice he has an accent and it turns out he lived in some British colony and actually fought in some sort of colonial conflict in the 60s or something.  It takes me a minute but I realize the whole conversation he keeps gesturing with his pistol and waving it around, generally in my direction.  I point out a couple times that it's making me uncomfortable.  He keeps waving it around, so I start getting up to go.  He gets in my way and is looking at me and asks me if I'm nervous.  I reply that no, I just need to be moving along or I get in trouble.  At this point, he points it at me and tells me to sit back down.  I'm thinking in my head \"SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT\".  The guy pulls the trigger and it squirts me in the face.  With water.  He starts rolling on the ground laughing his ass off as I just sit there in shock.  He ends up cutting a check for $200 something and apologizes profusely.  On the paperwork we do for donations, there's a little spot for notes (for when they go back to the area next summer), so I write \"may try to scare you with realistic water gun\".  My boss asks me about it, and I retell the story, at which point he looks horrified.  So, he took me out for ice cream and put it in the computer with a big note that this guy was nuts and someone from central can call him and not to send people back to his house.  So, terrifying as it was, I got ice cream and it turned out to be my best paying week of the summer.",

        "text": "So once upon a time, soon after I left the pharmaceuticals distributor that had the 19th floor brake room, I worked for one of those tax help companies.  We're not talking something like Liberty Tax or H&amp;R Block, or anything that just does tax returns during tax season here in the US, we're talking one of those companies that promise to reduce your taxes down to around ten percent of what you owe.  \n\nWell, OK, it's a legitimate business.  The IRS has a process for this called Offer in Compromise.  There are conditions to it (like you have to file your taxes on time, every time, no extensions, no exceptions) for five years after that, but if you're really that destitute and have no hope in ever getting a job in your field of choice, then yeah, they'll work with you.  Your home state, should that apply, is harder to work with, but similar processes exist.\n\nThis particular company was in Orange County, California, and the owner of this company had a habit.  A bad habit.  An illegal habit.  A very dangerous habit.  It involved dealers and putting white powder up his nose.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe way this firm worked was basically directing their marketing to people with liens placed upon their property by the tax agencies.  My job - sort this stuff out.  Harvest the data from the data set, prepare phone numbers and addresses, feed the phone numbers to the sharks, and prepare the bulk mail batch, which we did daily.\n\nDid I mention the drugs?\n\nWell, one fine day, the owner of the company decides, while he is in jail on drug charges (yep), that he's going to revisit all of those old lien adverts.  He wants them to go out in one shot.  \n\nI look at the data set. We have about 25,000 of these records that are not identical.  My equipment: about three pallets of pre-printed advertising fliers, which I run through a HP LaserJet 5SI on a daily basis, no matter how many I have.  We also had a stuffer-sealer machine that we used for this - a lower-end Pitney Bowes machine.\n\nHe wanted them out on a daily basis.  Made no sense to me - that, and he refused to understand that the stuff that got sorted at the main PDC in Vernon, California would spend three weeks waiting to be fed into the system and delivered, rather than getting sorted at the more local PDCs and arriving a day or two after departure - and save him money in the process.\n\nDid I mention the drugs?\n\nSo we got to work.  We rented two more HP 5SI printers, got the toner we needed, ordered more supplies, and I got to work.  I spent three weeks running everything through the SS machine after we spent three days printing the batch in several separate jobs, in a concerted effort to make sure that we didn't crash the workstation I was working with.  Meanwhile, the daily batches must be run and transported to the Anaheim P&amp;DC, which covers north Orange County.\n\nDid I mention the drugs?  They helped him work faster. How he maintained this in the slam, I don't even.\n\nSo we finally finish, I get back to my normal routine, and these things sat.\n\nAnd sat.\n\nThey blocked the coffee maker, so we moved the coffee maker.\n\nThey blocked the time clock, so we moved the time clock.\n\nThey gathered dust for another month.  \n\nBecause he would not approve the postage.\n\nThe postage bill for this entire load ran about $5,000.  \n\nDid I mention the drugs?  They sometimes came from the postage budget.  We had a nominal budget of around $1,000 per month for the postage meter, as we required this to send out monthly invoices and correspondence. \n\nWe finally got it out.  We took three cars, including the small pickup that one of the employees drove, and delivered the whole kit and caboodle to the US Postal Service, with an enormous check for the postage required, plus a little extra for future runs.  \n\nThey delivered.\n\nThis marketing campaign, ultimately, didn't really fail.  It helped a bit, but at the end of the day, the company folded.\n\nDid I mention the drugs?  Part of the payroll budget was required for that.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis happened around a decade ago.  I now do technical support, until I get a gig in IT somewhere.\n\nTo note, I have a labor commissioner judgement against him, set in 2005, for $4,000 as base principle; this is set for the owner and the now-dead company, jointly and severally (which means I can collect from either one).  In California, promising to pay vacation to somebody, and then failing to do so when they request it, constitutes shorting somebody's paycheck - and if you are short so much as a dime on somebody's paycheck, that constitutes late payout of payroll.  The penalty for that is one day's typical pay per day it is late, for up to thirty days.  As California applies a 10% APR on a judgement, he now owes me much more.  I don't expect that I will ever get that from him, however, even if I enforce collections against him.\n\nDid I mention the drugs?  \n\ntl;dr: What DARE programs don't teach you is that the name DARE is actually an acronym for \"Drugs Are Really Expensive\".",

Take a guess as to what is plugged in and who's at work.  \n\nYeah.\n\nI wait around a few minutes, and then once they are done, I plug the machine back in.  It kicks on.  Nobody was the wiser, and the machine was only unplugged for a few minutes, so no biggie.\n\nMonday comes 'round.  I get my burrito, go to work, don't get sick. In the process, I fire up WordPerfect, and make a sign:  \"Please do not unplug/No Disconectar, por favor\"\n\n(Our cleaning staff was Spanish speaking.  Yes, in English, too - there should be no question.)\n\nThe problem never happened again.\n\nI continued, however, to be amused by the fact that the old cleaning system always designated the big box of coffee cups for the \"19th Floor Brake Room\". =D\n\ntl;dr: If you don't want to piss off a bunch of angry people who deal with billing, don't unplug the fridge.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to complete a",

I suspect this may be a contributing factor. Not that I rose in the ranks in those 3 years either but... meh).\n\nFrom the time I first started working here until now, all the tickets she handled came back with near-insults (always *just* subtle enough not to actually be explicit, but clear enough as to be denigrating) and half-assed \"solutions\" (try this - try this - try this) or not at all (\"I have no idea\" - ticket closed).\n\nAt first this bothered me GREATLY and took a toll on my confidence. Every time I got a ticket back from her I felt like an idiot - and sometimes I still do. But with the years I did grow somewhat of a mental armor and it's become easier to shirk this off.\n\nOf course, people will tell me to go to my superior or HR. As we've just read in jon6's [epic tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1b2mf7/the_b_manager_from_hell_pt24_faq/), she's part of that circle of people who could, for lack of a better analogy, take a shit right on the boss's desk and still get *him* blamed for it. Let alone a lowly underserf like me.\n\nThus, I wonder how I can *subtly* take her back. Remember, I don't want to test her wrath - she has far-reaching powers by virtue of knowing the right people, even if she's dumb as a box of bricks otherwise.\nApart from that, she does have an extensive knowledge of our firm's workings, but things change so often and so fast that much of it is \"outdated\". I am by no means saying I'm a better employee or smarter than she is, this is solely about her demeanor towards me and others.\n\nI'm not after ruining her life or anything, I just want to... y'know, push some buttons.\nAny advice?

The staff of the institution do not have learning disabilities, this distinction is important.

As an early riser, I am almost certainly  one of the first people to notice this, and I am immediately aware of the safety consequences, all the more so given the clientele that will be exposed. So even before my first cup of coffee, I am exercising my brain, trying to figure out what to do about this.

I continue with my quest to talk to someone at the electrical utility and as I am navigating phone menus I see the first staff member arrive by car. The staff member stops short of the row of chairs, stares puzzled for a moment, exits the car, moves the chairs out of her way and proceeds to **drive over the fallen power line**. Obviously the risk is low, but I am pretty sure that she did not consciously weigh the possibility of voltage and how well protected she was with her tires.

I only heard about this through co-workers, as the subject of this story works only during the week on the front desk. I'll refer to her as M. \n\nStory: M is an older woman who works the front desk early in the mornings on the weekdays. I've only had the \"pleasure\" of working with her twice, and I've avoided the brunt of her rude behavior (side note: when I worked with her, the worst she did was persuade me from taking a break when I felt exhausted and then taking the food that a friend brought in for me). My coworkers have seen her at her worst.\n\nShe spends her time complaining about the other cleaners, ignoring the members' complaints, and generally being a bitch. Recently, the workers for the front desk have to \"compete\" in a contest to get members to sign up for the fitness training program and M decided to cheat by signing up members whether they wanted to or not. The straw that broke the Boss's back was that she spent a good portion of her shift complaining about how the cooler was running low of water. She then refused to stock it herself, as well as bitch about how there was no water in the closet. Boss flips and rips her a new one, telling her to do her job and stop complaining,\n\nAs far as I know, her bitchiness toned down a lot after that. ",

        "text": "As I've [written here before](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1352w4/a_big_black_guy_threatened_me_in_the_shower/), I used to work at a gym that closed at 4:30 p.m. on Saturdays.  Pretty much without fail, if something was going to go wrong, it went wrong at 4:15.\n\nSo one day, I'm working the front desk with my buddy Will.  Around 3 p.m. this member comes in.  He was this tall, slim guy in his early 40s who came in fairly regularly although never on a normal schedule like most of our members.  He was kinda weird and unpredictable.  Sometimes he was very talkative, usually annoyingly so, and other days he kept quiet and to himself.  I never actually saw him working out, which made me kind of nervous but my other coworkers saw him much more frequently and said he was weird but never did anything out of line.\n\nAnyway, he must have been off his meds that day because he seemed really agitated and kept going in and out of the gym.  He'd be inside for maybe 15 minutes then leave to smoke a cigarette then come back for another 15 minutes then leave.  The security guard said he would routinely see the guy talking to himself on the street and swinging around light poles.  I knew from his behavior this day something wasn't right.  At 4 p.m. we closed the pool as usual and around 4:15 we did a sweep to get people off the execrise floors.  Meanwhile this guy is still going in and out with increase frequency.  Finally he comes in around 4:20 and goes into the locker room.  He's the only person left.  By 4:35 he's still not out and we've basically shut down the whole place, cleaned up, and prepped for the next day.  Will and I probably could have taken the guy but were uneasy about forcing him out because he was so bizarre and we were scrawny teenagers.\n\nFinally around 4:40 as we're getting ready to go get him, the security guard comes around to the desk and says \"I saw your boy back there in the shower.  He was jerking off.  I told him he couldn't do that here and he had to get out.\"\n\nMaybe 5 minutes later he comes out and gives us this weird face.  I can't say it was a threatening face but the gesture was clearly an obscure \"fuck you\" as he left.",

I'm not familiar with the mens room at his work, so I'll paint the picture from what I know.\n\nIt has 2-3 stalls and a few urinals. Not a big place, it's more of a satellite office. \n\nMy husband has to use the toilet, and he enters what can only be described as the depths of hell. Surely no one, ever should be exposed to the complete horror of what lay in that stall. However just like the car wreck that you cannot look away from, this was just as difficult for the mind and nose to process. Apparently, one of the male co-workers had a slight emergency. He made it to the restroom, closed and (I would guess) locked the stall, pulled down his pants, and thats when the battle against the shitsplosion was lost.\n\nIt was a scene from a 3rd rate horror movie in the stall. While this persons ass was at least aimed in the correct direction, that was as good as it got. Shit was literally splattered all over the two side walls, and the back wall of the stall. It continued on in a dripping horrid mess down to the flusher, which was covered in what can only be decribed as \"liquid brown stank\" and was also splattered all over the seat and floor.\n\nThe aim must have been unusual (according to my husband) because the shit on the back wall of the stall was waist high. So not only was this persons asshole aimed backwards, but upward as well.\n\nMy husband was very thankful that he was not the cleaning person at his job that day.\n\n*Also, this happened more than once at this specific location, I do not recall if the total was two or three times however.*",

        "text": "Years ago I worked as a \"Database Specialist\", which is a fancy title for someone who does simple data entry, for a brand new company whose product was internet based.  \n\nWhen I say \"brand new\", I mean that when I was hired (first employee in my department, after the Mgr and Asst mgr), the company had just moved into their new office *from the owner/president's basement*.  Brand spanking new.\n\nMy job was simple.  Companies from all over the US would fax us their information (that changed daily) every day.  The fax would show up on the Mgr's computer, she would distribute the faxes to the Asst mgr and me, and keep some for herself.  We would enter the information into our database, which could then be searched by any of our subscribers on our website.  \n\nFast forward two years.  The company and, hence, my department, have grown so much that we have had to move to a larger office space.  There are now 8 other people doing the same job I am, 7 of whom I have trained.  (I have, in fact, written the training manual.)\n\nI love my job, and I am an excellent employee (if I do say so myself).  Of the 200 or so faxes that we get in every day, I enter over 100 of them, including all of the \"difficult\" ones.  I do this in the same amount of time that it takes my 8 other team members *and* the 2 managers to do the other 100 or so.  But, far from minding, I love doing it.  \n\nUntil.\n\nApparently, Asst Mgr got it into his head that he should rightfully be Mgr, and sets out to accomplish this goal.  The way he goes about it is to write programs for the computer, which he somehow thinks will get him promoted into Mgr's job (don't ask me how, as Mgr *built* the database, has been with the company since it was in the basement, and is personal friends with the owner/president).  In order to have the time to do this, he starts handing me most of his work.  I don't mind, I think its fun, so I add it to my workload without complaint.\n\nMgr sees this as a threat to her position (again, don't ask me why), so she calls me into her office for a \"chat\".  I am informed that the work Asst Mgr has been giving me is \"above my pay grade\", and that I'm not allowed to do it anymore.  I agree that I will not, but explain that it has been given to me *by my boss*.  She says she will handle him.\n\nLess than an hour later, Asst Mgr gives me some of his work to do.  I tell him that I have been told by Mgr that I can't do it anymore.  He gets irate, and starts yelling at me (in front of the whole department) and telling me \"I am your boss and I'm telling you to do it!\"  I again explain that I can't.\n\nSo he *writes me up* for insubordination!  Naturally, I go to Mgr and explain what happened.  She says she'll take care of it.\n\nNext day, repeat.  Another good screaming at, another write up.  I go to Mgr again.  Same story, she'll \"take care of it\".  Somehow, I don't believe her.\n\nSo I go to the owner/president (who I know, since its a small company, and he's always very friendly and chatty around the office and keeps telling us at company meetings that he has an open door policy).  I explain what's been happening.  \n\nHe gets a \"deer in the headlights\" look, and starts stammering.  The gist of the stammering was, basically, \"what do you want *me* to do about it?\"  \n\nSo I thank him, go straight to Accounting (we didn't have an HR department), grab a blank piece of paper and write \"I quit\".  I sign and date it, and go home, never to return.\n\nBecause, **fuck that**! ( Also because I was barely 23.)\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello one and all!  I've returned with more stories from my time working as a security guard at a theme park we will call *Five Penants*.\n\nAs I stated in my last story, this was the worst job I've ever had. It was only for one season, and it still aged me at least 10 years.  I have two tales today.  **Camp American Idiots** and **Bigots. Bigots Everywhere**\n\n*Camp American Idiots*\n\nI knew from the start that today would be rough.  It was already 85 degrees at 8am, and weather projections said it would reach around 100 degrees by 11.  To top it off, I was working a double.  9am till closing, usually around midnight.  My only hope was that I was on a patrol, and not assigned to a ride for both of these shifts.\n\nBut like a man who pulls down the panties of that thai hooker he suspects *may* just be a man, my worst fears were soon confirmed...\n\nI arrive at work, sign out my radios and equipment, and look at the assignment board.  Ahhh fucksticks...  There in bright red erasable marker is my name.  And next to it my assignment.  The most popular ride in the park *AwesomeDude: Guy of Iron* (Think super hero with red tights and giant letter on his chest).  I was assigned that ride for both shifts.  I wanted to punch a baby out of anger right then and there.  This was the most popular ride in the park, prone to a  lot of problems.  It had also been voted best coaster in the world several years running. It was EXTREMELY popular. Average wait time was over 3 hours. That meant dealing with a ton of people wanting to leave for the rest room.  It was fine to leave but we weren't allowed to let people go back to their spot in line. Once they left the line, they left their spot.  It was awful.  I had a single life guard chair to sit and watch. Or I could wander around and keep an eye on the lockers. I was not looking forward to dealing with line cutters, smokers complaining they couldn't light up, and fat people causing a scene when  they wait for 3 hours and then cant fit on the ride.  That happens WAY more than you think.\n\nCut to 5pm.  The mid day heat is just starting to fade, but its still blistering hot out.  The sweat stains on everybody's clothes are like a moving, complaining, Rorschach test.  All I see when I look into those shapeless patterns is myself, pulling my hair out, screaming \"WTF AM I DOING HERE!\"  It's hot, it's miserable, and just an awful day.\n\nOh I missed a part. Today we had special guests at the park. Camp America, if I recall.  It was a camp set up for kids who lost parents during 9/11.  They were obvious with their bright red shirts.  They weren't the only ones in the park that day, but you couldn't go far without seeing at least a few of them.  \n\nAnyways, it's late in the day, I've been dealing with bullshit since I first started my shift.  A while ago I had seen a group of kids from Camp America enter into the line.  Now, a few hours later, they are near the stairs leading up onto the ride platform. I see one of them on the phone.  A minute or two later, I see two other in Camp American shirts pushing their way through the crowd.  These two though, are counselors.  I see them walk over to the group of 4 younger kids, and begin climbing the stairs with them.\n\nSo I walk over to them. They are next in line to get on the ride at this point.  The operators of the ride see me and keep the car in the station.  I approach one of the counselors and calmly explain that they can't ride the ride. Only the kids can.  This counselor, Blake (Because he looked like a Blake.  Just imagine  any 80's movie bad guy named Blake. Now throw him in modern clothes. Nailed it), didn't like this.\n\nBlake: Why can't we ride the ride?\n\nMe: You can. Long as you go to the end of the line and wait like everyone else.\n\nBlake: But we're counselors. These are our kids.\n\nMe: Yea....\n\nBlake: So we have to stay with them.\n\nMe: So where were you the last 3 hours while they were waiting in line?\n\nBlake: We were with them.\n\nMe: No. I was here the whole time. My job is nothing but sitting and watching. It's awful, but easy. I've been watching them since they walked in because I thought it was weird that they didn't have any counselors with them.  But they were well behaved so I figured you guys just allowed them off on their own.  Now I guess you just wanted them to wait in line while you used other kids to skip the line for other rides. (Note: We had been getting complaints all day about this from other park patrons.)\n\nBlake: How dare you. This is Camp America man. This for kids who lost parents. IN 9/11!  \n\nMe: And did you lose anyone in 9/11?\n\nBlake:  No...\n\nMe: Ok then.  So here's the deal.  You're holding everyone up.  You cut hundreds of people who have waiting hours for this ride. You left your kids, who you're in charge of, alone for several hours. And you used them to ride the rides without having to wait. So, if you want to ride it, go to the end of the line.\n\nBlake: We have to ride with the kids.\n\nMe: Ok tell you what. Why don't you go and ask everyone in line if it's ok with them. If they all say yes, I'll let you ride with them.  Tell them it's for 9/11. They'll understand I'm sure.  \n\nAt this point Blake is staring at me. People in line are chuckling.  One large man, who was behind the kids in line simply says \"Don't even bother. End of the line asshole\", which got  a good laugh from the crowd. Blake and the other counselor just told the kids they'd wait for them at the exit of the ride and walked back through the line. The kids got on the ride, and the car began its ascent up the lift hill.  As I was about to walk away, the same guy who had just told Blake to pack it in, waves me over.  He is with 4 people, and says he wants to give up his spot on the next car for the Camp kids.  \"They already went through enough.  It's unfair they have to lose a parent and be stuck with dickholes like that. We can go after their second ride.\"\n\nDude's an American hero.  So the ride comes back into station, I tell the kids someone has offered to let them go again if they wish. They all cheered and took another turn riding.  \n\n\nAnd now for the dark side of humanity: *Bigots. Bigots Everywhere*\n\n*Warning: Graphic, hateful Language*\n\nSo at our park, we would host groups on occasion.  They were offered first sale of tickets for a day of their choosing. If they could sell X amount of tickets, the park was theirs for the day. If they couldn't, they would get first entry into the park, and then the park would open and hour later for regular guest.  They would be told their is a group function before they purchased their tickets.  It's also a little bullshit because season ticket holders would only be allowed entry if they purchased a ticket for the day.  \n\nI walked into work, and saw a huddle of my co workers.  Wails of lament could be heard from yards away.  \"Man, if I had known, I would have called out.\"  \"Fucking hate this day\"\n\nI ask whats wrong, and I'm told that it is \"Gay Day\".  Apparently once a year a local LGBTQ magazine rents out the park. It isn't advertised ahead of time because it draws protesters.  My boss gathered us round and explained whats up.  He had some simple rules for us to follow. \n\n1.) Treat everyone with respect. Doesn't matter our beliefs, you will be fired and held accountable if you do something stupid\n\n2.) Don't call anyone sir or ma'm or miss today. Just to be safe and avoid awkwardness.\n\n3.) If we see someone enter into a restroom and aren't sure of their gender, just keep an eye on it, but otherwise let it go.\n\nSimple enough. I have several friends in the LGBTQ community, and it doesn't bother me none.  My boss pulls me aside and says he wants me at special duty today.  This basically consisted of hanging around the ticketing area to deal with unruly customers. And also responding to any calls over the radio.  I couldn't imagine being needed for anything, but fuck was I ever wrong.  \n\nSoon after I was at the ticketing area dealing with an irate waste of life.  A gentleman was not happy that it was \"Fag day\".  \n\nWoL: This is bullshit.  I came here from Vermont. And I can't spend a day with my kids here because some queers wanna prance around?  This is wrong!\n\nMe: Sir.  Im gonna need you to stop swearing and calm down\n\nWoL:  Who are you? Some gay lover? Working for a gay loving company? \n\nMe: Sir I'm not even gonna deal with this today.  It's not even 10am and you're already winning bigot of the day.  We don't want your money, so you can take your kids and leave.  \n\nWoL: And what are you going to do about it?\n\nMe:  Me?  Ask you to leave.  And let you get worked up until something happens. Then I'll hold you here in front of your kids till those nice cops over there arrest you for assault, public disturbance, and whatever else they can tack on there.  \n\nHe decided it was a good time to leave at that point.  I wish i could say this was the only person like this. But most of the day was spent asking several people to leave the ticketing area. We had one arrest from a guy who threatened a ticket girl.  Several instances of people threatening to \"sue for discriminating my religious liberties\"  Dafuq?\n\nOne of these ladies was priceless:\n\nLady: This is wrong. I will sue. You're forcing beliefs that aren't my own onto me and my children. You'll corrupt them.  \n\nMe: Ma'm sitting here saying Jesus doesn't approve would also constitute forcing your beliefs on others.  And everyone seems to be having a good time. I apologize if this makes you uncomfortable but they bought entrance to the park.\n\nL: You need to read the Bible and see what Jesus says about the gays.\n\nMe: He doesn't say anything. It's all old testament.  It's next to the part that says you can't eat shellfish, or cut your hair, or wear clothing of mixed fibers.  Doesn't stop you from cutting your hair though.\n\nL:  This place is the hell on earth! You're all demons!\n\nM: Have a great day!\n\nIt was awful. I've never heard worse things in my life.\n\n**TL;DR- The good, the bad, the 'Muricans**",

        "text": "Hey everyone. After several successful post in [r/Talesfromretail](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/)  I have decided to post some of my other work stories on here.  \n\nI worked at two different amusement parks, two different summers.  These jobs were hellish. Easily the worst jobs I've ever had, and thats including a psych hospital.  One park was a small regional family park that may or may not be the oldest theme park in America.  The other, is a theme park owned by Ted Turner, that we will call \"Five Penants\".\n\n*Five Penants* was the absolute worse company to work for. Between their modern day slavery tactics (bringing people over on work programs from other countries, charging them food and rent, and not allowing them to leave the hotel except for work), the price gouging (Don't go to the Johnny Rockets in their parks. It's literally the same thing as all the other burgers in the park for double the price), and treatment of guests &amp; employees (writing me up for providing first aid to someone suffering from heat exhaustion, instead of leaving her on the ground and directing people around her till EMT's got there). And lets not forget how many pedophiles we caught the one summer I worked there ( I was involved with 4 or 5 myself).\n\nAnyways, the job was shitty, beyond shitty.  Guards were given a 2 hour training course that basically consisted of how to kiss ass and not piss off the customers.  A brief overview of the map of the park, and next day you're out there on your own.  The one thing they really wanted us to enforce was guest going withing the fences that surround a ride.  This was the year that another *Five Penants* park in Georgia, had a kid die when he jumped over two fences to get his hat, only to be killed by the Batman rollercoaster.  All rides had a fence around it, and if any part of the ride got within 15 feet of the ground, there was a second fence around that part.  Park policy was pretty strict. Anyone caught going over the fence was ejected from the park with a 100 year ban.  Why 100 years? Because logic.\n\nSo me, being an intelligent human being, assumed that this wouldn't really be an issue.  Fences are there for a reason and who would want to climb a fence into one of these areas where dangerous machines are flying by?  Obviously I was wrong. Super wrong.  We had several issues a week of people hopping fences. Usually to retrieve personal items that fell off during a ride.  It was insane how many people we caught going over into these areas.  The only explanation I can offer now is that all these people must be related, and their father is the judge who keeps letting Lindsay Lohan out of jail. \n\nSo one hot, summer day, I'm out in my cheap polyester uniform, sweating to death because why pay a lot for good uniforms that are only be worn for 5 months? It'll be smarter to buy uniforms that when you wear them, it feels like someone scraping sandpaper over your nipples after you just ran a marathon.\n\nAnyways, I'm walking, and I see a woman and her young child sitting on a wall in front of a fence.  The woman is watching the exit of the Batman coaster, obviously waiting for someone to get off of it. The young boy has a basketball in his hand, and is throwing it up and catching it. It's one of those small basketballs that we give out as a prize for winning a midway game.  The kid is super excited, and throwing that ball in the air like it's a one man game of S.P.U.D.\n\nJust then, the young boy throws the ball up in the air, and naturally, it flies behind him and sails over the fence and into the out of bounds area around the ride.  I can see this young lad staring, in disbelief at his quandary.  The ball is right there, *RIGHT THERE*. But unreachable.  I can only imagine that at that moment he felt like a fat woman on a treadmill, wearing a hat with a stick attached, dangling a twinkie just out of reach.  \n\nThen, being a young child, he begins to cry.  The mother oblivious, picks him up and asks him whats wrong.  He points to the ball, and the mother turns, seeing the source of her sons despair.  She tries to calm him, but being a foot away from the ball, he is just trying to reach through the fence, apparently attempting to use the force to bring the ball towards him.  I walk over to the mother, and tell her I'll get another ball for her son.  I see its a \"Tar Heels\" college basketball design, in black. I walk over to the basketball game across the midway, and ask the kid to give me the same ball to give to the kid.  Told him to make a not on his sheet that whoever retrieves the ball at the end of the day just add it back into his stand so he's not penalized. Sign off on it, and go back to the young boy to give him his new ball.  He's happy, mother is appreciative, I'm a hero, all is right with the world.\n\nBut like a drunk sorority girl waking up after a night of drinking, unsure if she had removed her tampon before fucking that frat boy the previous night, something felt wrong.  I continued to patrol the area, and shortly after, I see a \"gentleman\" walking up to the mother and young boy. The boy is showing his ball to his dad, and the mother is pointing to the ball over the fence, then at the ball in her boys hand.  I can see this man, shake his head, and stand up on the wall.  Determined, he grabs the fence, and I can see him start to try and climb said fence.  WTF?\n\nI run over, trying to get this guys attention.  He sees me, and steps down.  I tell him he can't climb the fence.  Now, let me take a moment here to digress.  I am not a handsome man.  Not ugly, but nothing special.  A 6 at best. Maybe a 7 if I dropped 40 lbs.  But I've always said if you ever want to feel good about how you look, go to a carnival, or amusement park.  The amount of human waste that walks around, just makes you feel better about yourself.  That kid from the movie \"Mask\" would leave any amusement park feeling like Hugh Hefner after getting his Viagra prescription filled: Unstoppable and slightly tired since he skipped his 3pm nap.\n\nThis gentleman, who we shall refer to as \"Bubba\", was a great example of the general population of the theme park.  A faded, stained, sleeveless tshirt, with the southpark characters as Saint Bernards on it.  Jean Shorts, with a chain wallet.  A beer gut that sticks out like a black guy at a clan meeting. And naturally, he's wearing sandals with socks on. And the socks are pulled up as far as they can go. Oh, and the smell of overpriced budweiser is apparent, even from 4 feet away.  This will play a factor....\n\nBubba: Well I'm getting my sons ball.\n\nM: Sir, I already got him a replacement ball.\n\nB: Yea but thats the one that I won. I paid $3 for it.\n\nM: I understand sir, but its the same ball. I can understand you won that one for your son.  But i can't allow you to go over that fence. Rides are running and you could get killed.\n\nApparently, Bubba took this to mean \"Oh I understand sir. Go ahead and climb.\"  He began to try and and climb again, his arms not strong enough to pull his massive frame more than a few inches, his sandals not giving him purchase on the iron bars.  I grab his shirt, and pull him down, using my radio to call for assistance as I do so.\n\nBubba, naturally did not enjoy me putting my hands on his shirt\n\nB:DON'T TOUCH ME OR I'll SUE!\n\nM: Stop trying to climb over the fence. There's a ride running and that ball is right near the track! Are you an idiot?\n\nB: I PAID $3 AND WON THAT BALL. YOU'RE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF!\n\nM: The prizes cost like $1 for every hundred of them.  We already make a huge profit off one person playing. Why would be want to rip you off for two? I gave your son the same damn ball. He is happy and you're the one making a scene!\n\nB: IT'S THE BALL I WON! \n\nKeep in mind that this entire conversation is being punctuated at random points by the sound of the coaster running not 15 feet from where we stand.  Bubba keeps trying to walk over to the fence, and I keep blocking his path. Eventually he tries to shove me out of the way, and things got physical. His wife is screaming and his kid is playing with his ball, happy as can be.  My co workers were already there by this time, and we detained him till the police arrived. The police escort us him to our control trailer, and the whole time Bubba is yelling for everyone to hear \"THEY STOLE! FIVE PENANTS DOESN'T CARE! THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY! THEY STOLE FROM ME!\"\n\nThe wife is crying, saying he's a good father.  Asking if we can let him go. We calm her down, and have her sit outside the trailer.  Cops run the guys record, and he's clean. We ended up just banning him for 100 years, and he got charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication.  To this day I still don't know why he wasn't satisfied with  the replacement ball I gave to his son.  \n\n**TL;DR- LANA! LLLLAAAAANNNAAAA! YOU'RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE DANGER ZONE!**",

        "text": "In the comments of Alcohol and dangerous machines I said I'd post about joining the Navy but, true to form, I remembered that I had another job before doing that.\n\nI was a roofer.\n\nMy step-father, at that time, owned a roofing company and, probably at the behest of my mother, gave me a job with one of his roofing crews.\n\nA bit about my step-father. He was truly passionate about roofing. He had t-shirts and bumper stickers that said, \"I am a roofer\". He had divorced his wife with whom he had four sons. He was a pious man and his sons were absolute zealots. But this story isn't about his sons so, I'll tell you about them in the comments, if you're interested.\n\nI figured, since I told him that I had done some *carpentry* with my grandfather who was a retired *carpenter* that he would put me on a shingle crew. Nope. Not how it works. Apparently everybody has to prove themselves on the hot tar crew, first. Do you know how hot *hot tar* is? I do. Disclaimer: I know it isn't tar. It's really asphalt (or bitumen if you prefer). Part of my job was to run the kettle. I had to use an axe to split the solid tar plugs (100 lbs./ea.) and \"load\" them in this seething cauldron of molten tar. The first job I was on had us pumping the tar up three stories so, I had to keep the tar between 525 and 550 degrees. Tar's flash point is around 450 degrees and it's auto-ignition temperature is only around 650 degrees. This is scary shit.\n\nOnto the crew. Because I was the stepson of the owner, these guys really had it in for me. They did everything in their power to get me to quit from the outset. Couple this with a horrible commute and these were dark days for me. I had been drug free since I left high school but things change. I start smoking weed at night to help me sleep and taking crosstops (speed) during the day to keep me going.\n\nWell, a roofing crew is small and it didn't take long for word to leak out. Pretty soon I was supplying the rest of the crew. **Especially** the foreman. He accounted for close to half of the consumption on the crew. The crew didn't let up on me ... they were just a lot friendlier.\n\nTime turned into a blur. I went on job after job. Got hurt and worked through the pain. Out worked guys twice my size. Paid my dues (or so I thought). Still couldn't make it onto a shingle crew. My step-fathers guard dogs pissed on the nice chrome wheels of my ride and rusted them right through that pretty chrome.\n\nThe last job I was on was putting the very first roof on a large public storage facility. The area that this place was in was very well known for the wind that kicked up every single day around 2:30 to 3:00 in the afternoon. And it was a cold wind. Not germane to the story but several of the guys got hurt on this particular job.\n\nOne day, toward the end of the job, the wind really kicked up. We were almost done picking up our gear and were about ready to leave when, on a lark, I walked to the edge of the roof, opened and spread my jacket and leaned forward. The wind held me up! COOL!!! \"Hey guys! Look at this!\" All of a sudden one of them runs over and grabs me by the back of my pants and the collar of my jacket and throws me off the roof.\n\nNow, in my mind, I'm convinced that this nut had thrown me forward over the barbed wire fence and above the train tracks running next to the storage place. The wind blew me over on to my back ... on the roof ... a good two feet back from where I started. In retrospect, the guy probably had just thrown me vertically to scare me but, I freaked.\n\nAbout a week or so prior to this, I had decided that my body just couldn't take the drugs anymore so I had quit and told the rest of the crew that I would no longer be supplying their speed. Ah, I forgot to mention, I had been supplying it for free.\n\nAfter this job, I and my step-father came to an agreed parting of ways. I heard from one of the guys that the foreman had been lobbying very hard to get me canned ever since my very first day. Even while he was gobbling almost half the speed I brought to work, he was trying his best to get me fired. After I stopped supplying him and especially after my post flight freak out, he insisted I be fired.\n\nThat was the last job I can remember having before joining the navy. There is a lot more stuff surrounding the personalities involved that don't belong in the tale itself. I may or may not cover them in the comments. We'll see. I promise, my next installment of The Chronicles of Rudraigh will be about the Navy. That's going to be weird. And long.",

        "text": "I was asked to post the tale of my second job having only mentioned it in my first post.\n\nMy first job (at an Arby's) only lasted three days because the manager would only schedule me for three days a week, three hours a day. On the very day I quit that job I was hanging around the house shooting the breeze with my sister's boyfriend (Stubbs or Stubby or something like that). He says, why don't you come work with us doing tree and brush removal. Pays $20 a day whether you work or not.\" I wondered how that worked but said \"Sure!\"\n\nNext day I meet his boss. He tells me that I would report for work every day but sometimes we would just hang out, drink and sharpen the chain saws and I would get $20 a day regardless.\n\nHELL YES! Count me in!\n\nA bit about the boss. He was apparently in his 40s but looked like he was in his 60s and had that glassy eyed look of a LONG time alcoholic.\n\nA bit about my particular job. Three guys go ape-shit in a forest and I clear everything out and throw it into our chipper.\n\nA bit about our chipper. The boss claimed it was the most powerful chipper around. This was back in the late 70s and this chipper was powered by a Chevy 283 ci. V8 engine. Yes, it was powerful for it's day. I see V8 chipper all over now but back then they were mostly 4 cylinder diesels. Anyway, this machine could eat a five inch diameter tree in seconds. Every bush branch and tree I threw into it had the chance of wrapping me up, sending me through and turning me into so much chili meat.\n\nFirst day on the job, I go to the bosses house (that's where we were to meet each day) and everyone is sitting around his kitchen table doing vodka shots! I was offered a shot and, well duh, I went for it. Our job for that day was at a school to clear the brush out from around it. Seems the kids were hiding in the bushes, getting stoned and having sex. Y'know, the usual.\n\nWell, I'm hauling this stuff as fast as I can but I'm falling behind and getting bawled out by the boss and the crew. Lunchtime rolls around and after I'd eaten my bologna sandwich I go up to the boss and say, \"Look, I'm doing the best I can but if that isn't good enough, just fire me and I'll get on down the road. No problem.\" OMG! All of a sudden these guys are all hugging me (I'd never been hugged by any man but my grandfather) and saying what a man I am (I was 17) to just come out and say that. WTF? So ok, I'm in good with these guys and they back off on the yelling and turn it more towards good natured ribbing about me falling behind. The day ends well, I'm exhausted and $20 richer.\n\nAh! Forgot to mention that the boss was nipping from a flask ... all ... day ... long.\n\nNext day, same place, same outcome.\n\nThird day, it rained. I showed up at the bosses house and we spent all day drinking vodka and sharpening chain saws. Oh, and playing cards. What the hell, I got paid $20 for that day. I can really be down with this!\n\nThe next day was just some light clean up at the school. Only took a couple of hours but, I got paid my $20. Bossman said to not come back to his place as he had some things to do. Okie dokie!\n\nNext day I go to his house but nobody is around. I wait and wait. Finally Stubby (remember him?) shows up but not in his pickup. He's in a little import car.\n\nSeems bossman got drunked up, stole Stubby's pickup and wrecked it and ended up in County jail. So much for that job.\n\nI heard, many months later, that bossman, with a different and reduced crew, managed to have one of those bushes, branches or trees wrap him up and send him through the chipper. I've never been able to determine if that was true or not but, I wouldn't doubt it was likely. He was always drunk and that chipper was very powerful. He almost lost a finger on my first day.\n\nPlot twist! Stubby sold weed to supplement his income. He was an Olympic class rower!\n\n**TL;DR:** \nOh Dunderbeck, oh Dunderbeck, how could you be so mean\nTo ever have invented the sausage meat machine?\nNow long tailed rats and pussy cats will never more be seen,\nThey'll all be ground to sausage meat in Dunderbeck's machine.\n\nNext: [I are a roofer](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/173yn7/i_are_a_roofer/)",

One of those places took those five gallon soda kegs and stamped the name of whatever company was leasing them onto the shell. That was where the alcoholic forklift driver fell asleep on the forklift and ran the blades right through the wall. I then learned how to drive a forklift. But, this is not that tale.\n\nI was sent to this place many miles away from home as a general dog's body. On the way there, I was doing exactly the speed limit, having been busted multiple times for speeding before I turned 18, when this dick started honking at me and then made an insane, high-speed pass (on surface streets, not the freeway) and flipping me off as he did so. I grumbled and wished he would get busted. BAM! A few hundred yards down the road, there he was, pulled over by the local constabulary! Justice!\n\nI get to work and find out the totality of my duties is to load scrap fiberglass insulation and scrap cardboard into a **HUGE** compactor/baler. And, I didn't have to do it alone! (YAY!) oops, too soon. My partner is a moron.\n\nThe idea is, toss a bunch of insulation into the baler and then put in a big piece of cardboard in order to give the resulting bale some structure, otherwise it will fall apart. The baler had a vertical shaft into which we pitch the material which is then compressed horizontally into the bale. Ok. Except my partner kept throwing the cardboard into the shaft horizontally (relevant in a sec). I told him, \"Look, you handle the insulation and I'll handle the cardboard and whatever insulation you don't get to.\"\n\nWell, I had to jump down off of the \"beast\" to get some more material. When I climbed back up, I saw that my partner had thrown a big piece of cardboard ... horizontally ... into the hopper. We had a cubic yard of fiberglass insulation at the bottom of the shaft with a nice cap of cardboard sitting right on top acting like a lid. As I leaned over and saw this, and my eyes went wide and I opened my mouth to scream, \"SSSTTTOOOPPP!!!\", My partner hoisted a two by four and slammed it down to knock the offending piece of cardboard down into the baler.\n\nCue fountain of fiberglass dust blowing directly into my face, up the sleeves of my shirt, into the neck of my shirt, even down into the top of my jeans.\n\nI fell off the baler (causing much consternation on the floor of the place) screaming with pain and choking on the dust. And, lucky me, this happened at the end of the shift.\n\nI was led to the eye washing station, choking and coughing, to clear my eyes so I could see (the whole time my partner swearing it wasn't his fault) and I was already starting to feel the itch.\n\nMy local boss told me to go home early and he would sign for a whole day (this being only 15 minutes before quitting time ... thank you too much!).\n\nSome things I haven't mentioned yet: it's winter, my car doesn't have a heater, I'm wearing a flannel shirt. It's completely impregnated with fiberglass.\n\nI go out to my car and start it up and head down the road. Oh shit. One of my headlights is out. I can barely see. I have no heat. I can barely see. I am FUCKING MISERABLE!\n\nI get home after more than an hour of driving (took half as long that morning), threw away my shirt and showered till I ran out of hot water. Went to bed utterly exhausted and still itching like crazy.\n\nWoke up the next morning and started dressing in fresh clothes, dreading going back to that place when ... the phone rings. It's the temp agency telling me that the company I had worked at the day before, \"no longer needed my services.\"\n\nMixed feelings.\n\n**TL:DR:** Doc, it hurts when I do this.\n\nNext: [Alcohol and dangerous machines](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16nu3u/alcohol_and_dangerous_machines/)\n\n[I are a roofer](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/173yn7/i_are_a_roofer/)",

I was to weigh them and, if they were light, throw a little more product in there to bring it up to the proper weight. The line foreman insisted this was very important (relevant later) I think you see where this is going. He showed me how to do it and I grokked things pretty well so he left me to the job. Literally seconds later, every single box came through either too light or with the plastic liner flopped over so it couldn't be filled at all. Well, I hit the emergency shut-down button and bring the line to a halt. The foreman comes out of the inky shadows looking for blood and in a split-second makes a beeline for me. He start screaming at me for shutting down the line. I pointed to the offending boxes and he sort of calmed down. Some adjustments were made, the foreman showed me my job again, again I grokked it and said I was good to go, again he left and again, seconds later every single box came through under-weight. Not wanting to be the target of the foreman's wrath, I kicked into insanely high gear.\n\nTo. No. Avail.\n\nI had boxes backing up like crazy. It was literally like the scene from I Love Lucy in the chocolate factory. Well, except I wasn't eating the detergent.\n\nSome guy on the line finally saw how far in the weeds I was and hit the button. Line comes to a halt and out comes the foreman, making a beeline straight at me again. He starts screaming at me again (I've been on the job for perhaps 30 minutes). I show him that every single box is underweight and suddenly he scream, \"IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT!\"\n\n*cue jaw drop*\n\nHe yanks me off the line and makes me a janitor. Right off the bat I'm sent to clean a restroom that someone (likely him) had just destroyed. The head janitor was standing outside the door with his arms crossed just staring at me. A few minutes later, the line foreman shows up and asks him very loudly if I had \"fucked anything up yet.\"\n\nI kicked the mop bucket over onto both their shoes and walked out. Total time on the job, 45 minutes from the time I walked in to the time I walked out. The shortest job I've ever had.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Mmmm ... chocolate.\n\nNext: [Please remove my skin](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16lgw3/please_remove_my_skin/)\n\n[Alcohol and dangerous machines](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/16nu3u/alcohol_and_dangerous_machines/)\n\n[I are a roofer](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/173yn7/i_are_a_roofer/)",

        "text": "I posted most of this as a comment to give insight on a post in /r/talesfromretail, but thought I'd post it here too. There's a tl:dr at the bottom.\n\nI work as a security guard for a large company, and I live in Canada, where employees seem to have rights.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, a paper copy of an e-mail was brought to my site, and it instructed me that I was to view and sign off on some bilingual inspection requirement. (Basically test you, then sign it, is what I understood), and it was to be submitted to the client company by the 1st of January.\n\nThis video was not available, so I e-mailed my supervisors, listing the missing files. My Manager replies, telling me to resend the e-mail, as I forgot to attach the files.......Q.Q...\n\nAfter clarifying that there were no files attached, that that was the issue, I was CC'd on several e-mails between my managers, all showing that they intended to deal with the matter.\n\nCut to the 2nd of January, Wednesday. \nMy employer calls me, asking why I hadn't completed the task, and I told them I hadn't received the video. \n\nThe next day, they call me again. Why haven't I done it? \"The other site did it!\" - I still don't have the files, \"oh...I'll get on that\". \n\n*The next* day, the 4th of January, and the video *still* hadn't been made available. One of my managers calls me in a panic, says they will try and e-mail the video...5 minutes later, a call back, she doesn't know how to attach it, and no attempts to explain it could help her, so she decides to burn a disc...ok then.\n\nAn hour later, I get a disc dropped off at my site. Instead of containing the video, it's a bunch of unrelated Security Camera footage...I call them to let them know. This was about 1100, I finish work at 1600.\n\nI hear nothing until about 1530, minutes before my shift ended. She was telling me I could either A) Sign off without viewing the video, B) Come in and view it after work, or C) Lose my job. (Keep in mind, I never sign anything without accepting that I'm liable if it should be false, and a company policy is to fire for making false reports, or lying)\n\nA quick call to the Labour Board does nothing...so after work I go to their office, thereby fucking up my plans for the weekend, costing me 2 hours of my time (1h40m driving...), and I'm only going to be \"paid\" for the time spent in the office (about 10 minutes). I say \"paid\" because this company is notorious for forgetting to pay your hours, and I'm not about to fight for 10 minutes. (I fought for an hour once, the next week I was missing 4, and the following week they forgot 11).\n\nTo top it off, the fucking video (of which the video portion didn't work), was just a narration of an Act that states that companies such as the Third Party's are required to offer services in English and French, blablabla. They could have just linked the bloody legal document instead.\n\nThe best part is how I spoke with the labour board about the fact that they forced me to go to their office after work, and the Labour Board says they can do it.\n\n**tl:dr: Company Management doesn't bother doing their job, leaves me to suffer because of their procrastinating, insufferable, and grossly inept abilities; Labour Board can't help me.**\n\nThe only good thing is that the member of the client company on the site I work, sent a record of the events that transpired to his HR rep (the one who requested this verification process in the first place), painting my company in a very bad light.\n\nEdit: To clarify, the chain is like this. 3 Massive Corporations. 1 is Security Firm (mine), 1 is Client firm (Building Managers), 1 is Third Party (Building Tenants). Client Firm asked Security Firm to prove guards are biligual, as Third Party is required by law to greet guests in both English and French.\n\nI do not like my company in the slightest. I feel more like a member of the Third Party company than I do part of my own company.\n\n**Follow up: They didn't pay me, big surprise there.**",

        "text": "A few years ago I took on a job at a well known office store. I applied for a computer tech position but was called and asked if I would be interested in doing custodial/maintenance while I trained into the tech position. \n\nI was well versed in floor care and so the job was nothing new to me. I was shown the floor machines and the stock of pads for the floor they had. For those who do not know, the shiny floors are places like Wal-Mart are due to being waxed, the machines that they run on the floors have a large semi-abrasive pad under the machine that heats up the wax as it crosses over and the melted wax then fills all the small scratches etc. to make the floor shiny again.\n\nThe pads last for about a week of constant use but have to be changed so that they will still get the wax melted. \n\nOn day one, I saw that we had a couple boxes of cleaning pads (red) and 1 single buffing pad (Light brown). I informed the manager that I had to have the brown pads to keep the floor nice and he said he would make it happen.\n\n2 months go by and I am still using the first pad I had and was accomplishing absolutely nothing. With repeated requests to get the correct cleaning supplies (This included a broom which they did not have) I was finally informed that they could not get me the pads I needed. \n\nAlright fine, I will do what I can with the old one then. Fast forward 3 weeks and I am stopped on the floor by the manager and he says the following, \" I have noticed that the floors have been getting dull and are not as nice as when you first arrived. I understand that once the excitement of a new job wears off it is easy to start slacking, however please make sure that you are doing your best as it reflects on the whole store if the floors look bad.\"\n\nI was at a loss for words. I have been working here 3 days a week 5am to 8am doing the dirty work in this store without any of the required supplies and am now being blamed for the floors not looking good. Priceless.\n\nThis was 1 of 2 jobs I ever walked out on. The manager had this misconception that the industrial strength amonia based floor sanitizer they had me using attracted flies. Granted, there was a lot of flies in the back around the bathroom, but it was from the drains in the floor, not the water. \n\nHe told me to not leave dirty water in the mop bucket and while it was kinda dumb due to it instantly killing anything that got in it, I did as I was told. One day I had a clean bucket of water that I had not used and knew I would be back in the morning, so I left if in the cleaning closet. \n\nI get a call when I am about 10 miles away that he found the bucket of water. I said I did not think it was a problem as it was clean and he promptly informed me that I needed to come back to the store to empty the bucket. I said that I was 10 miles away and he told me that he feels that the only way I will learn is by being punished and coming back to dump it. \n\nSo, off the clock I go back and dump said bucket and never went back to that job again. I was working 2 jobs, and this one was just spending money so it didn't really hurt me financially, but it was not worth the hassle.\n\n",

        "text": "Years ago I worked as a peon in a smallish professional office.  I was insulated from the company president by a layer of management, so I only rarely had any contact with him.  The few interactions I did have with President Derp, left me with the opinion that he considered himself to be a very important individual.  Even as a noob in the workforce, I knew this self importance was unwarranted, his father had built up the business and clientele and left it to his four sons as equal owners.  Pres. Derp made it clear that he was the first among the equal partners.  There were many events that tried my patience, but the one that stands foremost is the basis for this completely fictional tale.\n\nPres. Derp got the bright idea one day to impose a management exercise on the staff.  It involved getting the entire staff together and going around the room with each employee naming a weakness that was the greatest detriment to the business.  Once the weakness was aired, those assembled would suggest possible solutions and the employee would be presented with a goal or series of goals to improve the weakness and thus be a more valuable employee.  Since work was all important, this exercise was scheduled for after business hours, and since most employees were on salary, it would be uncompensated overtime.  To further taint the experience, management would not be providing any food; employees were expected to bring their own.\n\nI was immediately skeptical with this proposal.  I did not trust Pres. Derp, and identifying shortcomings could only be used against us in the future. I'm pretty sure most of the rest of the staff felt the same way and the fact that this was taking place on personal time meant nobody was going into the exercise with a charitable opinion.  Nevertheless, the exercise commenced and the Seinfeld-esque \"airing of grievances\" began:\n\n*\"I don't see projects through to completion.\"*\n\n*\"I don't spend enough time in the initial assessment stages.\"*\n\n*\"I frequently forget to CC people on emails.\"*\n\nThis essentially turned into a banal list of mostly harmless things, because nobody was going to go on record with, \"my alcoholism is interfering with my job.\" or \"my boss' wife give awful blow-jobs.\"   When it came to Pres. Derp's turn, the assembled staff is wowed with this staggering admission:\n\n*\"**The day is not long enough to get everything accomplished that I know I can do.**\"*\n\nIn the silence that follows,  I whispered to my neighbor, \"His weakness is that the planet spins too quickly??\"  The startled look on my neighbor's face was a hint that perhaps my voice carried a bit further than intended.  A quick glance around the dozens assembled shows barely concealed smirks and outright giggles and it is confirmed, my whisper was too loud.  Pres. Derp is not amused but says nothing.  The exercise continues and I sit silently, embarrassed; dreading my turn to air my weakness.  I hear nothing that follows, I sit red faced under the stares of my coworkers, awaiting my turn.  When it comes, I quietly stammer:\n\n*\"I don't always think carefully before speaking.\"*\n\nSilence.  Pres. Derp drops his characteristic scowl and actually smiles.  The room lets out its collected breath and the tension that had been building from my initial unguarded comment instantly eases.\n\nA month later I was applying for unemployment benefits and mailing out resumes.  \n\ntl;dr - insulted my overly serious boss, embarrassed myself and am confident that my gaffe is still talked about to this day.",

I was a bit enraged about that, this has been the 3rd time in two years that  something like that happens to me for company events. They know that I registered for the event, they have the list of people that registered, and so they make me work that day. \n\nBut well, I actually wasn't in the mood for party anyway, and weekend nightshift is nice and relaxing. Also they promised catering for the poor souls that had to work instead of partying. \n\nThe \"catering\" by the way looked as if it already had been eaten by    someone. Even after eating it I wasn't sure if that wasn't the case.\n\nBut that was not the part which really made me furious. \n\nThe part that made me furious was the mail from my boss the next week that noted that of 20 people of our team registered only 15 had come, and that we (personally!) were responsible for squandering money that could have been used for something else.\n\nHmm... short check... I had to work on the night of the party, my colleague worked 6am shift the next morning, and three people were on sickleave. \n\nTime to look for another job, I don't know if I can survive this bullshit management much longer.",

        "text": "I worked as a grocery store cashier for all five of my highschool years. I have posted some of the customer stories on TFR, but I would like to share with you. Sorry if it gets wall-of-text-ish.\n\n**i) Sick Daze**\n\nThis one happened about three years in. I was sick. I mean hug-the-toilet sick. I called in saying I couldn't make it - the first time I ever had. The manager says 'Ok, we'll find someone,' which is what I'd expect, given that we don't get an up-to-date phone sheet.\n\nNext day is a staff meeting to get our new uniforms. Why couldn't we get them when we next came in? Because half the staff only came in nights and weekends, and management didn't want to either stay later than 4 pm or leave the shirts out in the open. I call to see how long the meeting will be so I can arrange rides.\n\nI get chewed out over the phone for not covering my shift. And told that I will get lectured when I get to the staff meeting. No one ever did lecture me, though.\n\n**ii) Stop picking on the shop lifter!**\n\nSo there was a man who came into the store and he always had a backpack. It would generally be empty when he came in (not that we checked, but the bag was , well, baggy, so it was obvious) and full when he left. A group of us noticed and told the store owner after a while.\n\nResponse? Stop picking on him.\n\n**iii) Vacay Melee**\n\nBooking time off at that store was a disaster. You and anyone else would write your name on the day you wanted off on a calendar, and when the schedule was made, the manager would look at the calendar and decide who got what days off. There was no way to say who wrote their's first, or what they wanted to do, so someone who wanted to party would get the day off while the one trying to go to the dentist would have to figure it out.\n\nAbout a year in, I was going on a week's vacation with my family. I had requested it off well in advance, had told my manager verbally and left written notes. The schedule comes out.\n\nWeek one - One shift.\n\nWeek two - Three shifts.\n\nWeek three - Five shifts.\n\nWeek three was the one I booked off. Trying to be good, I found other people to cover most, but the last one no one would get back to me on. So I told the manager (again) that I was going to be in a different country, and that I tried and only needed a person to cover one last shift. She did take care of it, but it was frustrating having to remind her for the fifth time that I would be OUT OF THE COUNTRY.\n\n**iv) Clairvoyance is not part of the job description**\n\nAs a cashier at this grocery store, it was always a good idea to check the schedule when you came in, because the cash manager had a habit of changing things and not telling anyone.\n\nWell, I worked on Sunday, and my next scheduled day was Friday. Sweet! Time to get homework done *and* socialize!\n\nWednesday rolls around, and I get a call from my manager. \"You were supposed to be in half an hour ago!\" I tell her that I'm not, and she tells me she gave me the shift.\n\nNow, I know it wasn't there Sunday. I'd checked. So I ask when she gave it to me. Apparently, she did that on Monday.\n\nI asked her how I was supposed to know that I had a new shift if no one called me, and she backed down. It may have also had something to do with the fact that I told her I was babysitting my nephew (not entirely true, but that's besides the point).\n\nSurprisingly, she actually learned and even started *asking* if I could take extra shifts once the schedule was out.\n\n**v) Gold star for doing diddly**\n\nI tried at the start to be good and do extra jobs when it was quiet, but no one cared so I stopped. I was the best dang cashier I could be when the customer was there and that was it. No cleaning the bathrooms or break room. No facing. Nada\n\nCustomers loved me. It may have been the fact most of the time the other cashiers I worked with would rather talk to each other about what they did last Friday than make friendly with the customer. I like to think it was my charming personality. Either way, being a customer favourite endeared me to my manager, who after a long while started to adore me.\n\nThere was another cashier, let's call her Goody. She cleaned like there was no tomorrow, faced, and other assorted chores. But, since she didn't spend as much time getting a good reputation with the customers, she lost out. I got my days off, she didn't. I got good shifts, she didn't.\n\nHeck, I had a customer like me enough to warn me that my manager had customers that she'd asked to keep an eye on us. When Goody, who was bagging, tried to speak up, the customer snaps \"I wasn't talking to you!\" at her and turns back to me.\n\nThat was how I learned that it's not going the extra mile that gets you places, but kissing ass.",

Yesterday the phone lines were a little wacky, so they transferred the lines to our answering service (they typically answer the calls from 9PM to 7AM).\nWell, we can go on the answering service's website to monitor calls as they happen. So we were returning the most urgent/important ones via cell phones. \nWe got a call from a disgruntled former employee, Sarah, asking about our insurance. The answering service employee offered to transfer her to the general manager's cell phone and Sarah's response was a little unexpected. \"I would rather bathe in HIV needles than talk to that woman.\" Keep in mind that she wasn't rude or angry. She said it so matter-of-factly. Everyone was monitoring these calls so a lot of people heard it.\nThe bizarre part of it is that the manager had nothing to do with her being fired. She worked in an entirely different department. I don't know where the animosity came from. But it was understood that we were all supposed to act like we didn't hear anything.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/1352w4/a_big_black_guy_threatened_me_in_the_shower/",
        "text": "I used to work at a gym (most of my crazy stories start that way) and on Saturdays we closed at 4:30 pm because most of our members were office workers and mostly worked out during the weekdays.  Naturally, if anything went bad on a shift, it always went bad at 4:15 pm and we'd always have to try to scramble to resolve things before 4:30 so we wouldn't have to stay late.\n\nOne afternoon at 4:15 pm, I'm at the front desk with my coworker and the manager on duty Dante.  A little (5'3\", 130lbs) white guy in swimming trunks and dripping with water speed walks up to the front desk and says, \"A big BLACK guy just threatened me in the shower!\"  To put this in perspective he says this to three black guys who are all at least 6 feet tall.  We're sort of stunned because of the emphasis on BLACK, altercations between members were extremely rare, and we had accounted for who was still left and none of our usual troublemakers were around.  We asked him what happened and he doens't really say anything specific but keeps repeating that a \"big BLACK guy\" threatened him in the shower and he asks us to go back in there with him.  \n\nSo we go with him to the shower.  At this point, I had been at the gym for several years, so I'd seen more naked old men than most people, no sweat, but going into a shower to resolve  a dispute or follow up on a threat is just uncomfortable.  It was a 3-sided open shower with roughly 7 or 8 shower heads.  The four of us go in there and there's an ancient white guy showering and lo and behold a big (6'3\", 285lbs) black guy showering.  As soon as he sees us he basically gives the \"I can't believe this shit\" face and he and the white guy get into it.  Through their bickering we determined that the big black dude was showering and the little white guy started showering right next to him despite the fact that there were other showerheads available.  It apparently made the big black guy uncomfortable and he said something to the little white guy and it escalated.  At one point the ancient white guy yells at the two of them to stop arguing, just shower, and leave.  The big black guy was physically intimidating but his attitude seemed very low key and he seemed inclined to just want to shower and leave.  After a couple minutes we felt everything was ok and went back to the desk.\n\nFive minutes later, the little white guy comes out and says he wants us to call the police for him (this was right before cell phones were ubiquitous) and we're all just like \"Fuck, we're going to be here late, again!\"  But he made it clear that he felt very threatened by the \"big BLACK guy\" so we called. The big black guy came out a few minutes later and with the news of the police being called decided to stick around.  The big black guy trolled him a bit while they were waiting for the cops  saying stuff like \"Yeah, I've seen guys like you before.  I'm not scared of you.  I had a judge roll up on me once, and I put him in his place.\"  The little white guy periodically retorted with stuff like \"I'm not going to let some big BLACK guy go around threatening me.  I don't let that kind of stuff happen.\"  We heard the phrase \"big BLACK guy\" no fewer than 15 times during the whole ordeal.  Perhaps it was a pure statement of fact but the emphasis on the BLACK became increasingly comical the more he said it.\n\nObviously without any physical violence, the call wasn't a very high priority so we had to wait maybe 20 or 30 minutes for police to show up.  They talked to the guys together and then separately and in a nutshell told them both to grow up.  No police report was filed.  We filed an incident report internally, which meant absolutely nothing and that was that with us leaving work more than an hour late on a Saturday.\n\n**EDIT:** TL;DR A big black guy \"threatened\" a little white guy in the shower at a gym where I used to work resulting in me having to stay an hour late for no real reason.",

        "text": "It was suggested by some folks over in /r/talesfromtechsupport that this would be a proper venue for this story, and I apologize if it is not.\n\nA little set-up is required.  I was doing tech support at an engineering firm, working for an egg-shaped man with a hitler moustache.  I was WAY beyond what I was actually being allowed to do, so I had a tendency to ignore my evil-ex-boss and just get the job done, no matter how many toes I had to step on.  To this day, i'm sure he thinks that it is I, and not he, who was the idiot in this relationship-gone-wrong.\n\nI was obviously unhappy with this situation, and had been sending out resumes as if that were still something fashionable to do.  And on this very day, I had managed to score an interview with a promising-looking start-up.\n\nOn the previous day, I had cause to visit my boss's office, only to note that he had a management screen up for the VM server I had spent months carefully setting up and populating for an overseas project.  He was actually trying to MANAGE it.  Without really even knowing what the word \"virtualization\" meant.  And inevitably, was going to break it, and then blame me for making it in the first place.\n\nAfter YEARS of putting up with his bullshit, I decided to put my foot down.  I consoled into MY VM server, took away his permissions, and changed the root password.  It probably bears noting that by this time, I had memorized the location of every fire axe in our warehouses, in case I wanted to plant one right in his fool moustache.\n\nSo there I was, going about my dreary business, when my phone rings.  It's the HR director.  \"Hey, Rum, can you scoot over to my office for a minute?\"  \"My plate's kinda full, I've got a user with the wrong user name, a console with a bad keyboard...  is this something that can wait?\"  \"No, actually, I need to see you right now.\"  \"Sure thing, I'll just finish up what i'm working on and be right over.\"\n\nNaively, I'm thinking her laptop is acting up again due to yet another trojan... caused by yet another toolbar... that she downloaded.  But, no, I am in for a surprise.\n\nI get to her office, and say, \"what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"There's no tactful way to say this, but I'll try.  The board of executives has decided to let you go.\"\n\n\"Let me go where?\"\n\n\"... you're fired.  Frankly, we know you've been looking for other work, and it was suggested that you might sabotage the company's infrastructure.\"\n\n\"Sabotage?  Really?  After everything I've done to keep this company going despite its incompetent management?\"\n\n\"Yeah.  You have ten minutes to clean out your desk.  We'll comp you for the rest of the day, naturally.\"\n\nShe walks me over to my desk, and there is my evil-ex-boss with a shit-eating grin on his face.  \"I'm gonna need all the company property you have.\"\n\n\"Here's your phone, here's your computer that you don't know how to operate.  I'm taking all MY stuff, and don't you dare get in my way.\"  He observed as I took down the Wall of Me and carefully packed it in a box.  Lifted an eyebrow when I took a couple of decent beers out of the company fridge.  I kept all the thumbtacks out of spite.\n\nNow, one other little detail, not particularly relevant to the job itself.  My cousin had been in and out of the hospital for months, and we didn't know why.  Pursuant to this, she asked if I could manage a laptop for her.  We had a ton of old laptops gathering dust, and I asked the guy in charge of them if I could borrow one?  He handed me one and said, \"Yeah, keep it.\"\n\nSo, my evil-ex-boss is escorting me to the door, with my box of my possessions, and he says \"I understand you have one of our laptops.  We're gonna hold your final paycheck until we get that back.\"\n\nFine.  Glad to be out of this shithole.  If I ever see again, anywhere, for any reason, I will cut open your belly and force-feed you your own entrails.  My parting words?  \"There's no love lost.\"  And home I went.\n\nI come stumbling in with my box of crap from my desk, and my flatmate is crying her eyeballs out, and then notices me.  \"What happened?\" she asks.\n\n\"I got sacked.  What's with all the waterworks?\"\n\n\"I have ovarian cancer and I'm probably going to die.\"\n\nWell... shit.  \"I have to step out for a bit.  I'm going to buy an enormous quantity of booze.  Anything I can get you?\"\n\n\"Tequila,\" she says.\n\n\"Back in a jiffy.  Are you done with that laptop?  My final paycheck kind of depends on it.\"\n\n\"No.  But I will make it so,\" she says with a sigh.\n\nSo, I buy some booze, and we both get likkered up.\n\nNext day, dawn broke hard, and my first thought was, \"I still have undrunk booze.\"  And if you ever start a day at 7 am with more than one shot of 151, it ain't gonna end well.  This one certainly didn't.\n\nSo I've got this laptop, and this friggin' useless retard trying to make me dance for my last paycheck.  And, drunk as all hell, I call him up and leave some voicemail.  \"You foul foul filth piece of foul foul filth, I have your foul foul filth laptop, and I'm bringing it in monday.  And if don't get a receipt, I'm gonna pound your face until my fist is as broken as your face, you useless retard.\"\n\nThen I blacked out, and I didn't really remember doing that either.  Until Monday rolled around.\n\nMonday morning, and I'm having the worst hangover ever.  My flatmate says to me, \"the police were here, I told them you were out.\"\n\n\"Well, what did they want?\"\n\n\"They didn't say.\"\n\n\"It's probably about that damned laptop, maybe they reported it stolen, and I'll be damned if I want to see my evil-ex-boss again.  I'm gonna have my friend drop it off and get a receipt for it.\"\n\nSo, laptop returned, receipt in hand... I think this is OVER.  Boy was I wrong.\n\nCop comes rolling around.  Pretty little thing, decked out in as much body armor as her slight frame will allow.  \"Can I speak to Rum?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what's up?\"\n\n\"Keep your hands where I can see them!\"\n\n\"OK... who are you, and why are you here.\"\n\n\"I am a police officer, and you made some threats against you ex-employer.\"\n\n\"... what now?  They have their stupid piece-of-shit laptop, I have a receipt for it.\"\n\n\"You threatened to punch him in the face until your fist was a broken as his face.\"\n\n\"... oh.  Yeah I guess I did do that.  I just want my last paycheck, and to have nothing more to do with these jerks.\"\n\nCop goes away.  Next day, a certified letter with a paycheck in it.  Hooray!  I'm done.  All I need to do is cash this, and my business with these jerks is concluded.  Or so I think.\n\nSo I cash the check.\n\nA week later, I get another certified letter.  The check bounced.  My final paycheck?  From a special account that was made out of rubber.  So, I give the money back to bank.  Not much choice, and I'm planning my next move.\n\nAnother week later, I get the bombshell.  It's another certified letter, from my ex-employer, demanding THEIR money back from the check I attempted to cash.  Accusations that I was defrauding them, over a rubber check THEY cut ME.\n\nSo, I did the most reasonable thing I could think of without spending money.  I sent them a registered letter.  It said, basically, \"you cut me a rubber check and then demanded money I never actually got back.  You can give me actual money, plus the $25 it cost me in transaction fees, or I can consult a lawyer about a harassment suit.  pick one.\"\n\nThey cut me two checks.  A real paycheck, and a check for $25.  I never cashed the latter, I still have it.\n\nAnd that is the tale of my last day in tech support.",

        "text": "Now that I quit and am happily re-employed, I feel that I can actually post stuff like this in public.  I used to do lots of miscellaneous stuff, mostly web maintenance and graphic design, for a small family-owned business.  Being the one person who knew how to install Windows (as well as being competent with a search engine), I was naturally the self-titled \"Makeshift IT Guy\".  I'll add that I had and still have a good relationship with these people, only there were some ways they ran the company that I wasn't too fond of.  Anyways, here's some random things off the top of my head that I dealt with/observed at my time with this company:\n\n* was assigned the task of installing a Costco-purchased 16-camera security system.  I actually had fun doing this, except for the fact that I had to put one on the wall behind my desk literally staring at my back.  The other 2 cubicles in the office (for order takers and another designer) had to have the same thing.\n\n* was yelled at for countless stupid things.  One of which was hanging my jacket on the back of my chair.  I was told to use the coat rack in the front of the office like the other warehouse employees (who don't have desks).  Mind you, i was 22 when this happened.\n\n* one of my coworkers (years ago) was scolded for building a spreadsheet for logging excess material for a product that was cut to size in house from a larger stock. (i.e. something came in 50\" pieces, was then cut down to lengths of 10\", 12\", 14\", etc.  The guy doing this was individually measuring each piece of waste, taking hours to do.  The spreadsheet just simply took inventory of the pieces cut and calculated the waste)\n\n* Was scolded many times for using the computers for personal use.  I would do things like check my personal email, look on craigslist, check my bank statements, etc.  That's fine and I completely understand that policy.  However, the last time i got in trouble for this, i was informed that they've been using a keylogger this whole time on *every* computer in the office.  Time to change my passwords...\n\n* Was asked a few times to help out the owners' son (who also worked for his parents) with his college homework.  Help out as in do it.  I would only agree to work through stuff with him.  That didn't matter though, as they had his girlfriend, yet another employee of this company, work his assignments on company time.  They literally payed her to take an online college course (which i presume they were also paying for) under his name while he worked for their company.  I decided to not get involved with that whatsoever.\n\n\n\nThat's all I can think of right now.  Being there for ~7 years, I'm sure I have a lot more material, but it's not coming to mind.  Anyways, I now have a much better job at a bigger company that treats their employees like responsible adults.  It's great.",

We have to be in the new office by MONDAY.\n\nLuckily, I've been hedging my bets and talking to the owner of our current office space, and they have a 4 office suite in our price range that is sitting empty.  Now all I have to do is pack up 2 offices worth of crap and furniture and move it in a week.  \n\nOh, and there is no overtime.  The other woman in the office will help when she can, but as I'm the de facto office manager and she has clients to deal with, most of the burden falls on me.\n\nAnyone know where I can get some cartons that can hold dense reference books?\n\n*edit - and if you're wondering why I'm on Reddit instead of packing, I'm sitting in a public area waiting for people to show up so I can hand out applications.  The packing starts when I get back to the office.",

        "text": "So, I used to work at a chain restaurant, let's call it Pizza Land. \n\nBackstory: I was a waitress, and the back of house guys (BOH) were complete idiots. Not only that, but our manager was a totally nervous kind of guy, always terrified that either a customer would yell at him, or his manager would, or both. \n\nSo, one day, this family comes in: parents, two kids. I go over to take their order, the woman explains to me that her husband and both their kids have a fairly serious milk allergy, and asks that they can have their pizzas with certain toppings, but no milk anywhere near their food. \n\nI'm quite new to the job at this stage, so I go to the manager and ask him what to do. He gives me the allergy sheet, the family pick the food they want, and my manager tells me to run it as 3 cheese pizzas, and what the wife wants.  I make a point of going into the kitchen afterwards and telling them what they wanted, saying that it will come through as 3 cheese pizzas, but they really want this. I write it on a post-it and stick it on his terminal, for goodness sakes.\n\nSo, I go see to other people, it gets kinda busy, and so I am serving another customer when their order comes through. My manager takes it to them. It's 3 cheese pizzas. Just like I expressly told the BOH idiot I did not want. \n\nOf course, this is all my fault. My manager brings me over to the family's table, who are clearly all right with the mistake, and yells at me in front of them. I was 16 at this stage, this was my first job. I have to admit, he yelled at me so hard I had to stop myself from bursting into tears.\n\nAfter the horrifying incident, I go to the kitchen to ask what happened, and I see my manager comforting BOH idiot, telling him it wasn't their fault that the order was messed up, and that I wouldn't last long if I kept up this behaviour. I was appalled. I was also 16, and had absolutely no idea how to voice these kinds of concerns. I left about a month after.\n\nTL;DR: Lousy BOH guy causes tiny, teenage me to cry my sissy face off.",

But this involves two different workmates: DJ Brazzle Dazzle, and Captain Strugglugs.\n\nDJ Brazzle Dazzle was my supervisor, we were the same age and had similar responsibilities, but he knew his shit. Well respected by the lads, he was still just one of us instead of an office whore.\n\nCaptain Strugglugs was one of our apprentices, slow... In movement and wit. The biggest red flag was when our boss described him as, \"Just like me when I was an apprentice\".\n\nEvery time we recieve a new PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), the workshop becomes a war zone for about half an hour. They arrive packed in styrofoam strips, that with a little imagination, become all manner of bladed weapons.\n\nDJ Brazzle Dazzle that day, was wearing his +2 Stealth Fancy Pants, and decided to utilise them by hiding around a corner waiting to clobber an unsuspecting leet_hacksaw with his foamy katana. I was hip to his jive though... As I rounded the turn, I assumed my power stance, raising my hand to block the killing strike.\n\nWhat DJ Brazzle Dazzle failed to compensate for, however, was air resistance. Moments before foam met hand, the weapon collapsed on itself, exploding in a starburst of styrofoam nodules.\n\nCaptain Strugglugs had witnessed the entire thing, and, admittedly only for an instant, it appeared to him that I had decimated the weapon using only my mind (again, not real smart). The misty-eyed look of hero worship I received in that moment was hilarious.",

        "text": "I work for a major car rental agency located at a North Eastern US Airport that I would classify as \"medium\" in size.  Not the busiest airport, but large enough to be classified as a 'hub' airport.\n\nAs part of my duties we sometimes have to wash/prep cars.  Not a big deal to me.  The facility that I work has a CSR (me) working this particular shift since its slow.  I'm the only one there.\n\nI'm outside getting a car ready when I receive a phone call from a customer asking where we are located.  I tell her we are at the particular airport in the terminal area.  She states that she believes that she is at the correct location but doesn't know where to go.  I tell her to look for the signs (posted at the main entrance to the airport) that point to the reservation desk.  \n\nOnce again she states that she believes she is at the airport, but is not quite sure.  I see her driving by the road directly in front of the terminal building, and flag her down as she is driving.  I asked her if she saw me and she said that she did.  She once again asked me where the terminal was and I told her that it was the big building that I was standing in front of, and she is in front of now and to park in the parking lot and come in the main entrance.  \n\n**At this point and time I knew that I was dealing with a Rocket Scientist!!!**  If its not obvious, I work at a place that has aircraft (jets/props/helicopters, etc) in plain view of the terminal.\n\nShe came inside to the reservation desk, told me that she had hundreds of questions before she rented and told me that she had lived in the town next door to the airport and never knew that our county had a airport.  **She said that she lived there most of her life!!!**\n\nShe was cute as a button girl, mid 20's I would say, and on her blouse it said that she was a nurse.  She had to be under 25 because she told me that she is underage for rentals without a fee.\n\nAnyway she had gotten a quote online from one of the Reservation people and wanted to clarify exactly how much it would be to rent a vehicle.  I asked her the reservation number, and she provided a number that I was not familiar with as a reservation number.  The number she had given me was a quote for a car rental, and not a actual reservation number.\n\nHer response to me is that it was a reservation number and needed to confirm it.  I asked her what location the reservation was for, and she told me that she did not ask for a particular location yet, but insisted that she had this reservation.  In a roundabout way I tried to explain her in many different ways that this was not a reservation number, and that the quote could change depending on what location she rented from and was dropping off at.  She did not understand this. \n\n**As a sidebar I should mention that we are not a corporate location for this particular company and do not have access to the entire reservation system, unless the reservation affects our particular location**\n\nShe asked if there was anyone else there that could help her out, and I told her I was the only one working there.  She asked whom the person was in the next booth, and if they could help her because I did not  understand what she was trying to explain to me. I told her it was one of our competitors (Which we get along great with, and help out from time to  time) and if she wished to get a quote from them she was more than welcome.  She said that she preferred our company and said that she had all sorts of coupons, referrals, etc.  I said ok, no problem and explained to her how I could help her.\n\nShe wanted to use a debit card and I explained to her that a person using a debit card can have up to a $400.00 additional hold placed on it above the actual rental price.  It is our company policy, and I told her that a normal deposit is $250.00 and at our location they have elected to only add an additional $200.00 instead of the $400.00 hold. So a debit card would have a $450.00 placed on it total.  (The actual hold we could do on her rental was $700.00)\n\n\nShe did not understand this at all and insisted that I was over charging her, and she looked at the paper we had on our counter in regards to debit cards and showed me where it said \"up to an additional $400.00 can be held above the actual rental price\"), and told me that I was doing things illegal because I was withholding $450.00 instead of \"$400.00\".  Literally I spent the next 10 minutes explaining to her like she was 5 the basic arithmetic.  \n\nHer basic rental price (before discounts) was around $300.00.  I told her that we are withholding $450.00 and that if the total at the end of the rental was $300.00 then she would get $150.00 placed back into her checking account.  Of course if there were late fees, she didn't fuel the vehicle, etc that $450.00 would be taken out of the \"hold\".\n\nShe started to berate me some more, calling me very incompetent among other things.  She said the quote I had quoted her was much different than what she received from the person over the phone, and that I was too dumb to know what I was doing because she had a reservation #.  She also asked me why I did not do a credit background check on her like the person on the phone did.  I told her at least at our location we don't do background checks.  We have your driver license information along with your credit card information.  If you don't pay then we have avenues we can pursue this through the court systems.\n\nI told her that if she gave me her e-mail address I could send her a quote, or make a reservation for our particular location  if she would like.  She told me she had a e-mail address to send it to, but it wouldn't do any good because she doesn't have internet at home.  I asked if she could could use another computer, possibly her work computer to check it (she had a gmail account) and once again berated me because she \"doesn't have internet access\" and was infuriated that I didn't understand that she couldn't access the internet.\n\nI asked her to contact the reservation number again and confirm the information with the agents there because at this point and time I was about to bang my head against the wall, and was literally beet red from trying not to laugh and keep my composure.  \n\nMeanwhile the other Rental company agent was over at her desk literally having a belly laugh while listening to all this going on and couldn't even look at me with a straight face.  She also stated that she has never dealt with someone that was so stupid.  And the girl in question.. Well I hope I never run into her at the hosptial......\n\n(This is long and I left out some of the other details, as my dealing with this person went on for at least 45 minutes).  I finally walked out of the airport terminal and went outside because I couldn't deal with her anymore.",

        "text": "There are two guys I work with, who for the sake of anonymity will be referred to as: Scrooge McFuck, and The Muffin-Top Madness. The following occurs in an electrical workshop I worked in 2 years previous.\n\nScrooge McFuck is an older gentleman, bred Old Navy, part time handyman, part time Maritime endorsed shark hunter, full time storyteller. The most interesting man I have ever met. Has a hundred stories that, if I heard them from anyone else, I would call bullshit, but from Scrooge McFuck, 100% legitimate.\n\nThe Muffin-Top Madness is your standard workshop clown. Utterly hilarious, until you were the target. A god of the minor inconvenience, each major prank a masterpiece of workshop warfare.\n\nOne of The Muffin-Top Madness's less creative, but more frequent ideas, was Toilet Terror. Our toilets were a single door set-up, one toilet. Randomly, when someone was in there, The Muffin-Top Madness would throw an 8mm bolt at the door. The noise inside was akin to Cthulu's bellowing orgasm. The 8mm limit was imposed after a 16mm bolt penetrated the hollow-core door, narrowly missing an apprentice. There was so much urine... Everywhere.\n\nNow, Scrooge McFuck had a few quirks, as is to be expected from a life experience such as his. One of these is putting the entirety of what he packed for lunch on the one sandwich, stating \"it all goes to the same place anyway\", as he scoffs down a meat pie and cake extravaganza. Another is that he leaves his shits to the absolute last minute, desperately sprinting to the toilet before he soils himself.\n\nOne fateful day, Scrooge McFuck hammered past me, in the middle of removing his pants. Immediately after he closes the toilet door, a bolt whistles past my head and impacts against the door with the force of a... bolt hitting a door really hard. There was a crash, quickly followed by a scream. Scrooge McFuck had fallen over, breaking the toilet and shitting everywhere.\n\nThis, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason that I caught glimpses of an old man shitting, every day for over a year, because he refused to shit with the door closed ever again.\n\nTL;DR: There are many topics I will freely discuss on the internet, the origins of those nicknames are not among them.",

What is important is that our product is multiple pieces of hardware controlled by our software. It only controls some types of hardware and not others.\n\nAnyhow, I get a call from SomeTVCompany and he tells me they have the standard system with a \"BAR Encoder\" underneath the usual gear. No one has told them how this works. No one has told them how to connect anything. No one has given them any instructions. Hell, No one has even told us this has happened. I dispatch a tech.\n\nSo, follow up later in the day. Ticket gets logged. This system was manufactured the proceeding week. The day before the rental goes out, they discover they're missing a piece of the FOO encoder and can't actually make the system work. \"No problem, we'll put in BAR\", they say to themselves rather smugly thinking they have solved the problem.\n\nExcept, our software doesn't know how to control the BAR. It knows how to control FOO. Making the system FUBAR.\n\nNeedless to say, they'll probably be getting their money back, someone will get a stern talking to and we'll probably lose that customer. All in a good days work.",

        "text": "I work as a lowly bank teller at a small community bank.  Like many customer service related jobs, I get my fair share if irrational customers.  One might argue people get even more irrational with tellers as we are dealing with money here, but I digress.  \n\nToday's story focuses on a charming fellow who pulled up to our drive-up, he asks for a deposit slip, fills it out and half-heartedly tosses the check and deposit slip into our motorized tray (the little box do-hickey that you see in bank drive up lanes).  I reach in to grab his deposit and notice there is no check to be found.  \"Sir, did you still have that check? I can't seem to find it.\" I say.\n\n\"No, I put it in the tray.  I watched it go in.\"  He replies.\n\nThese motorized trays have a lot of panels, moving parts and compartment space.  My first thought is that the check is somewhere inside the empty space under the tray.  So another teller and I dismantle the tray looking for this guy's check all the while he's getting  more and more impatient, swearing up and down he put the check in the tray.  Once we've confirmed that the check is nowhere to be found inside the tray I begin looking outside our teller window to see if I can spot the check on the ground in our drive-up.  I notice it instantly.  \"Sir, I think that's your check on the ground there.\"\n\n\"Impossible, I saw it go into the tray.\"  He responds.\n\n\"Could I ask you to check and make sure that isn't your check?\" I ask.\n\n\"Am I going to need to call your manager?\" he growls back. Irate, he continues to threaten the other teller while I step away from the window, go outside the bank, walk up to his car where I spotted the check, pick it up, hand it to him and ask \"Is this your check?\"\n\nFlustered, he acknowledges it is his check.  I take the check from him, walk back into the back to my computer, run the deposit and send him his receipt. \"Here's your receipt.  Have a nice day.\"  I tell him.\n\nHis only reply: \"The wind must have blown the check out of the tray before you pulled it in.\"  He then drives off.\n\nThere was no wind.",

        "text": "Derp is a terrible programmer, perhaps back in the good old days of using fortran for the Russian army his fortran skills looked pretty good but today we call this skill \"math\" and we no longer use pencils and paper. For whatever reason Derp has been thrown back into the workforce and has somehow found his way to my company. His unwillingness to take advice from co-workes is his major downfall. The following is a description of his development process using a automated car wash as an analogy.\n\nDerp shows up at a car wash. His goal is to wash a car, so he somehow found his way here. I mention this because this will be his only correct step. Derp immediately pulls past the teller machine and directly into the washing area; disregarding any the directions telling the driver not to drive forward. The casual observer will note that the machine may not actually function at this point. Next he exits the vehicle leaving the door open as he walks to the teller machine. He identifies and immediately presses the Start button - nothing happens. He presses this button again and another button called \"Stop\". No results so he presses the buttons many more times each time harder and hard. Still nothing. Next he sees a coin slot. A quick chuckle insues. \"Ha ha, I should have expected this Microsoft car wash to be greedy.\" He reaches for a penny from his coat pocket and turns to his fellow co-worker and asks \"How long should the card be washed before it would be clean?\"\n\nPuzzled the co-work explains, \"it doesn't work like that, you have to pay $6.00 and you have to use the tokens provided from that machine over there. First you pay then you press the...\"\n\nDerp interrupts, \"I know what I am doing! I am just trying to determine the length of the car wash so as to ascertain the quality of the wash given by this machine. Architecture is very important and not to be looked over!\". Derp scoffs at inexperienced the co-worker. \"So you think about 1 hour?\".\n\nThe co-worker tries again, \"It doesn't work like that, there are different sets of washes, cheap, extra soap, with or without wax. Length of time really isn't considered.\".\n\n\"Ha ha, yes they are very greedy aren't they\". No matter. Derp proceeds pour pennys into the coin slot, coin after coin all get rejected. And start to jam the coin return slot. After this he tries dimes, quaters, \"Damn Microsoft, you'd think they know what they are doing by now!\". Finally - perhaps when no one is looking Derp makes a trip to to the token exchange machine and returns with a token.\n\nThis time Derp confidently presses the start button, inserts his token, and strolls to his car and waits for the wash to begin. After some time he falls asleep (Microsoft is very slow you know). After a few hours Derp wakes up to find that his car is still dirty. \"Damn this microsoft crap! You would think they could make a simple automatic car wash!\". With no other choice Derp decides to rebuild/fix the car wash himself. Derp exits the vehicle and finds a hose. He connects one end to a spout near the car entrance. He walks over to the car but stops short when the length of the hose is found to be too short. He jokes with the co-workers, \"This greedy company - give us a hose that is exactly long enough to run from their spout to their machine, but not long enough to wash the car with!\" In Derp's mind he has already found many reasons to abandon this Microsoft car wash, unfortunately he cannot even name a single other car washing company so he is stuck with this one. Derp proceeds to disconnect every hose that he can find. Basically dismantles the entire facility one piece at a time. He then fastens the hoses together using duck tape whenever needed. Taking a break from his duct taping sessions he has a quick chat with a fellow co-worker. \"Do you know, that the cheap 3 dollar duct tape works better and far more reliably than using microsoft's own hose connectors? In fact many of their hoses are difference sizes and are not even compatible with each other! How can such a company exist?!\"\n\nThe co-worker caught is dumbfounded, having a vague idea that Derp has been assigned the quick task of \"use the automated car wash to was a car\" he cannot fathom what Derp is doing with a dismantled car wash parts all around him. The co-worker suggests \"You know they have an automatic car wash that does all...\"\n\n\"No no, I don't have time to learn about another company's car wash. I do not perfer Microsoft to Linux but this is what I have to work with. Besides I just got this one working.\" (Holds up tangle hoses). \"Although next time I may choose to never use another microsoft product in my life.\"\n\nCo-worker: \"..uhh, this other car wash is Microsoft. I mean the one you are using. They have an automatic car washing machine now-a-days which makes washing a car very easy...\"\n\nDerp: \"Believe me I've taken a look at their automated car wash machine, and I know what I'm saying when I say that 'It doesn't work.'.\"\n\nBy some stroke of luck Derp manages to get a set of tubing together. Being made of duct tape it has a 5 minutes life span before more repair in necessary. The tubes will provide water to about 10% of the car. And in order to wash the entire car Derp has to move the car multiple times. Finding soap however was a quick win, after dismantling every piece of the car wash facility Derp has found more than $6 dollars worth of soap, or something like soap and chooses to use it all. \n\nNow Derp is in a situation where the car is still dirty, covered in soap, needs to simultaneously move the car and spray water on it, not to mention scrub the car it himself.  So what's a person to do? **Now is the first time Derp is willing to call for the help of his co-workers**. He's got the framework laid out. (You three go create hoses, you two repair the hoses as they fall apart, you scrub the car, meanwhile Derp will pull drive the car in circles.) \n\nDerp proclaims the job is done. And gives a word of advice, the problem is not so much putting the soap on but getting all of the soap off!\n",

        "text": "Last year I had the privilege of being a lifeguard supervisor. It was my job to drive around to pools all day and make sure teenagers were doing their job. Understandably, there were a lot of frustrations, but this one takes the cake.\n\nFor some context, I'm going to give you a crash-course in pool systems. [See this picture?](http://www.parpools.com/images/Pool/Care-Other/Pool-system.jpg) Essentially, water goes through the pool from the drain and skimmers to the pump, though the pump's filters, and back into the pool through the inlet valve (or jets, as most people call them). There are two important things to know here:\n* Sometimes the pump filter gets clogged, and you need to \"backwash\" the pool. This runs the pump in reverse, using the water to push crap from the filter into an external drain. This lowers the water level of the pool. This should only ever be done for 5 minutes at most.\n* The water level should always be above the skimmers; otherwise, air will get into the pump, which is really, really bad.\n\nSo, anyways, one of the pools I supervise has a moron of an assistant manager. This is, for sure, the stupidest person I've ever met in my entire life. We'll call her Lauren. How she got to be assistant manager, I'll never know, but one day, while she's working, maintenance staff comes by and tells her that she needs to backwash the pool. Any competent person would have interpreted this as \"backwash the pool for 5 minutes.\" She interpreted this as \"backwash the pool until it's empty.\"\n\nSo she puts the pumps in reverse and leaves them in that position for 2 hours.\n\nAround this time, I'm on the other side of town, stuck in a pump room (which is basically a really loud sauna), trying to pick a piston out of a pipe with needle-nose pliers. To express how annoying this is, imagine someone put a pipe cleaner down a really long straw, pushed it down just out of reach, and then told you to get it out. While doing this, I get a call from moron #2, we'll call her Alexis. She tells me that she came at the end of Lauren's shift and that the pool is down past the skimmers and that she had just walked away from her shift without doing anything.\n\nI told her to shut off the pumps and turn on the hose, in a mad scramble to fill the pool up. She did so, and then asked how much shock (chlorine powder) she should put in. Normally, you're supposed to put in about 30 lbs. So I ask how big her scooper is. She says 2lbs, so I say use 15 scoops.\n\nIt was a 3lbs scooper, and she put 45 lbs of chlorine in the pool.\n\nSo, by the end of the day, I spend an hour in the sauna, the pool was pretty much drained, half of the pumps had sucked in air and had to be replaced, and the water that was in the pool was the color of milk.\n\nNo punchline, just another snafu.\n\nTL;DR - some idiot drained a pool and destroyed half of the pumps.",

        "text": "I work at a mid-sized tax and book keeping office. As it is tax season, we have been very busy lately. I work reception, so I'm the front line in the war on irate clients. Most clients aren't too bad, but every once in a while there are some real rotten apples.\n\nClient #1:\nA man came in to file his 2006 and 2010 returns. It is now the 2011 tax season. We had to spend 30 minutes trying to explain to him that CRA(Canada Revenue Agency) was working on the 2011 tax returns, so previous years  are set aside. He kept yelling that he was going to sue us because we were refusing to give him his money, which isn't ours to give in the first place.\n\nClient #2:\nDropped off her tax papers to get her personal and small business returns completed along with her husband's personal return. Usually there is a back-log of dropped-off returns, but this particular time there wasn't. She had dropped it off March 24, and it was completed on March 25th. We called her to come sign the papers on March 25th. She came in March 29th, signed and paid. It was the eFiled, the same day. A week or two later she called to make sure that everything was done and it was submitted, because she hadn't received her refund yet. I told her that it was, and that CRA received it on the 29th. She the flipped out demanding to know why it had taken so long to get done. I was speachless. Her actual words were \"I was in WEEKS ago, and why was it only filed last week!\" She then proceeded to complain about the service she received, and stated multiple times about how unhappy she was.  Keep in mind it takes CRA at least 10 business days to send a refund. It had only been 4 business days when she called because of the Easter weekend.\n\nClient #3, well more like multiple clients:\nThe Ontario government has changed how the process refunds from deductible rent. How it was last year was that any amount of you rent that was refunded to you, was put on your lump-sum income tax return. They introduced the 'Trillium Benefit' this year that changes that. Starting this year, any refund from your rent is no longer applied to your lump-sum refund, but is instead spread out through the year, in monthly cheques. The amount you get is the exact same as you would get if it was included on your income tax refund.\n\nA large number of our clients are in lower income brackets, or are elderly, so a lot of them only got a refund because they could get their rent refunds on the income tax refund. But now, a large portion of them no longer are getting an income tax refund, and refuse to listen to our explanations about the Trillium Benefit. A lot of them have decided not to even files their taxes because of it. We try and explain that you actually need to file your return to qualify for the Trillium Benefit. So not only are we losing clients, some aren't even filing.",

        "text": "I work in a hotel, a pretty low-end budget type hotel chain in the UK. Ours is a new build so it is a LOT nicer than a lot of the other hotels in the chain. A lot of people only pay around £20 a night to stay there. I figured I'd share some weird hotel stories I have - anyone else work in a hotel and get the same? \n\n- Couple weeks after we open, a very nice mild-mannered man in maybe his 50s makes a reservation. Everything seems normal on check in, and on check out he reports no problems. After he checks out, the housekeepers come down and say 'Umm, I think you better come look at this room'. We head up, the thing I notice instantly is the room stinks of alcohol and sweat. There's blood on the mattress and on the walls - only a few spots so I figure maybe nosebleed? Around the bed there's half-empty bottles of vodka, some broken. We go into the bathroom and the toilet is full of blood. Half of the toilet seat has been snapped off to a point, which is stained with blood. The shower is also all bloody. We spent ages looking for the missing piece of toilet seat and find it hidden under the bed. \n\nObviously we have to document and take pictures and let head office know since there'll be a charge. A little while later, the man comes back - it's a different receptionist on so she doesn't recognise him, but he says 'I think I left something in (wrecked room number) and she instantly knows, and has to call a manager to explain there'll be a charge. He just agrees and walks away. The next day he came back when I was on shift and asks me if there's any way he can pay in cash rather than have his credit card charged. I felt really bad for him :(\n\n- A story one of the night-shift workers told me: The fire alarm suddenly went off late at night, around 1 or 2am. We have a system where we can see which alarm is going off so we can see if it might be a false alarm. This is in one of the rooms, probably just someone smoking but it could be a fire, since it's a long way from reception the procedure is to call the fire brigade and evacuate since there's no type to run up and check. Our night-shift workers work completely on their own, so it's one guy trying to get everybody out safely and reassure them - and there are 60 rooms, including some family rooms, so potentially more than 120 people in the hotel. He does everything he should and then knocks on the door of the one occupied disabled room - he knows there's a woman in a wheelchair in there with her husband. They yell at him through the door that they don't want to come out. He eventually calls through that he's coming in, that he needs to evacuate. They open the door and this woman starts pushing her wheelchair right at him, ramming it into his legs and insisting she wants to stay here. I'm amazed he kept it together really, with all these people running through the corridors.\n\nWe got complaints from so many people in the morning. It turned out it was some people smoking. :/\n\n- I covered a night shift for someone who was sick, which I don't usually do. Halfway through the shift one of the rooms is reporting a fire alarm fault. This causes a fairly loud alarm to go off. It's mostly down to people putting socks over the alarms or messing with them so they can smoke or something. So I have to go up to the room, there are a bunch of young guys staying in this set of rooms. When we get groups like that checking in, we have an agreement that one person in the group has to sign, to take responsibility, which says they can't smoke, or mess with fire equipment, or disturb other guests, stuff like that. I can hear them talking to eachother, saying 'oh shit hide it quick! put it in the bag!' I knock on the door and apologise, explaining that there's been a fault with the alarm and have they noticed anything. I can immediately see that they've taken the alarm off the ceiling. I ask them where it is, after much arguing they produce it from the bag. It's a pain in the arse cause usually those things just refuse to go back on and we have to get a technician to replace the whole thing or do some rewiring. I say that there is a charge for tampering with the fire equipment, and remind them of the form they got a member of their group to sign. They go quiet, and I say we'll need to discuss it in the morning, and go back downstairs.\n\nAbout ten minutes later all of the members of the group come to the lobby in their pants and socks, and start arguing with me, calling me a 'silly bitch' because they hadn't done anything. I'm trying to stay as calm as I can, explaining the policies, and I produce the paper that one guy signed. He goes off on one about how it's not his fault; I point out that he should blame his friends since they messed with the alarm. All together they are there in their underwear for nearly half an hour, completely ignoring me pointing out that it's about 3am and they should all go to bed. They still don't until I threaten to kick them out, and have the police called. \n\nIn the morning they didn't mention a word of it. We say they'll be contacted by head office to arrange payment for the damage and they just shrug and leave.\n\n\nSo so many weird things happen. Sometimes I feel a little bad, but most of the time, these people are so blatant about the weird things they do in hotel rooms. :/",

        "text": "I have worked in customer service for almost 6 years. I began working full time when I was 14 (while still going to school). I am nearly 20 years old now and have accumulated more weird, disgusting, outright ridiculous things than I ever thought possible. \n\n* Backstory: My mom is hawt. Like still gets ID'ed when her an I go out for beers together (legal drinking age here is 19). My mother also happens to own the two gas stations I work at (and manage). She recently left on a three week vacation leaving me to run both her stores and continue working at my third job. There's a regular that comes into my gas station all the time and after seeing me there every morning he commented and asked where my mom was. I told him she was on vacation leaving me in charge. He responded with \"She'd better give you a nice big bonus when she comes back or I'm going to have to bend her over me knee and give her a spanking\"\n-After she came back home he tried to follow her out of the store in a joking manner saying \"I'm gonna see if you're ticklish\" to which my mother responded \"Actually, you're not going to fucking touch me\" Haven't seen him since-\n* I get asked my creepy old men all the time for a Lotto SEX 49, with creepy winking. (Instead of 6/49)\n* A man asked me once for a Western 6/49 lottery ticket with 4 boards and an extra (it's a Canadian thing) but he wanted the ticket to be $3.00. This is not physically possible. Each board costs $1.00 and the extras is another dollar. You do the math. That's $5.00. While explaining to this man that I can't actually do this, my cell phone rings. Now I am usually very good about not answering my phone while dealing with a customer but this was a phone call from the other store I was managing so I answered and asked them to wait. So I have my phone propped on my shoulder, still trying to explain to this man that his lottery ticket will cost $5.00 when he says \"maybe if you weren't on the fucking phone, you would have some fucking idea what I'm talking about, you stupid bitch\"\n* A man pumped his gas and the total came to $40.01. He comes in to the store and my cashier goes \"Good afternoon sir, you had the $40.01 on pump number 3?\" (Standard greeting) He responds with \"Yes but I'm not paying that one cent. I have complained about this before!\" He goes off on a big tirade about how our pumps never stop right on the dollar and that it \"jumps\" three cents and how the stupid manager at \"this stupid fucking place\" needs to call someone to fix it, or risk losing a customer. I jump in and say, as sweetly as possible \"Good afternoon sir, My name is DFTBAwesome and I am the manager here at Canadian Tire Gas Bar.\" He turns to me and says \"no you're fucking not. You're too young to be smart enough to manage\" Basically we argued until I finally told him to just leave the $40.00 and I would pay the ONE FUCKING CENT out of my own pocket. I made sure to wish him a wonderful day before he left. \n* Our garbage bins outside are only authorized for the use of our store. We can actually charge people for throwing garbage in our bins. So this guy pulls his truck up one day and starts throwing garbage in to our bins. So my mother (who as previously stated) owns the gas station, walks outside and politely tells the man he is disposing his garbage on private property and that only the owner can authorize dumping in these bins. He rounds on her, red-faced and yells \"Well I AM the fucking owner of this place so you can just fuck right off\". I don't know exactly what happened but he left in a hurry. \n* I work at a Canadian Tire Gas Station. We give out 3 cents per liter back in Canadian Tire Money on every fuel purchase. We do not however, accept Canadian Tire Money as payment at our store. ONLY the retail stores do. Usually about once a week I have someone try and pay me in CTM. And nearly every time I get told I'm new, stupid, fucking retarded, or \"Last time I got to pay with it\" I always manage in the nicest possible way to explain \"Actually, I have been a manager at this store for nearly three years. There is no possible way for ANY of my staff members to accept CTM because our system has no POSSIBLE way to allow it.\" They usually leave pretty quickly. \nJesus I fucking hate people. ",
