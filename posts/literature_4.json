        "text": "Charles Baxter’s “Harmony of the World” (1982) is a portrait of a man destined for mediocrity. The protagonist comes of age in a small town in Ohio, where he is the quintessential big fish in a small pond. He has some musical talent, he is told he is special, he believes it, goes to college, finds out he’s just not as special as he was made to believe, and takes a job as a music journalist for a newspaper in a town much like the one he grew up in. He has the skill for the piano, but not the soul for the music. \n\nThe narrator/protagonist takes a side job as the accompanying pianist for a female singer who, while not technically a musical savant, enjoys her practice and performs for a group of people who love her. The two become romantically involved briefly, and it seems as though things will work out. Opposites attract, creative hearts aligned, all is well. \n\nAfter the recital, the protagonist cannot contain his rage at the singer’s lack of precision within her craft and explodes at her - causing her to leave the relationship, and him to wallow in his own self pity and continued tortured ordinariness. \n\nWoven throughout the story are references to Hindemith’s symphony of the same name, which the narrator is simultaneously reviewing for his job at the paper. The small town residents weren’t as moved by its brilliance as the narrator beloved they could be with the power of his excellent and educational introduction of it, so he had no choice but to give it a poor review to reflect that misstep. \n\nQuotable: “Such a symphony would have to pass beyond technical sophistication into divine inspiration, which Hindemith had never shown any evidence of possessing. It occurred to me that Hindemith’s lifelong sanity had perhaps given way in this case, toppled not by despair (as is conventional) but by faith in harmony”.",

        "text": "Apologies if this breaks the \"no curriculum advice rule\" \nI was looking for an informed perspective from readers, but it does relate to education. \n\nI teach literature and language in an international middle school.\nI assign a book to read over a 6 week unit, setting a clear target to read a few chapters each week, then do a reflecting task based on those chapters. I have several students who read the whole book in the first few days. They are mostly good about not spoiling the plot for slower readers. \nPart of me thinks it's great, they are keen and able readers who clearly enjoyed the book. They can answer questions on it well, and have a good understanding of the content.\nThe other part of me wishes they hadn't, and thinks they might have got more out of the book if they'd taken more time over it, pausing to think along the way.\nWhen I was growing up binge watching a TV series wasn't an option, and we'd have a week between episodes to process and speculate. I feel like that time was valuable, and led to a deeper understanding. Obviously that has never been the case with books, apart from waiting for a sequel. Am I being old fashioned in my thinking? Should I ask them to reread it at a slower pace? Do you read first and think later, or stop to thing as you go? \nAll thoughts welcome, from a teaching or a reading perspective. \nFor context, the books we are currently doing are Wonder by R. J. Palacio and Ender's Game by Orson Scott card.",

        "text": "Hi all, thanks for checking in!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrictly speaking, I myself am currently still reading this Chinese classic in a very thorough annotated German translation by sinologist Eva Lüdi-Kong. More on why I say \"strictly speaking\" below. Primarily, I was wondering about your experiences with the book(s). Did you like it? What fascinated or confused you? What else did you notice, maybe about your own reading? \n\nAnother reason why I created this post is to see how the number of readers and the reception have developed since [this post back in 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/ygmno/what_do_you_guys_think_of_journey_to_the_west/). I'm wondering if there's a trend towards more people reading it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeware spoilers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for my own experience in general:\n\n&gt;!The reason I wrote \"strictly speaking\" above is that, about three or four months ago, I fell out of my daily reading flow of The Journey to the West, and since haven't picked it back up. I had started reading it quite a while back and got to around chapter 80-ish out of 100, my main motivation being that I have an academic background in sinology and felt it was time to tackle this classic. Despite my education, it was never easy for me to approach Chinese classical texts and I thought this one might break the ice.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I assume that already tells you a little bit about my experience. However, I must add there are multiple ways to approach, read and enjoy The Journey to the West, just as much as there are lessons to take away from it.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy issues with The Journey to the West:\n\n&gt;!First and foremost, I suggest to not, ever under any circumstance whatsoever mistake this book for an easy-going novella. Quite honestly, the Journey can be pretty boring and repetitive. Character development is slooooooow and I would even argue a number of (if not all) characters are supposed to embody certain attributes, which keeps them from real character development due to their purpose. Furthermore, although there are a few unique situations like the impostor monkey king, quite a few predicaments the protagonists find themselves in are repeated over and over again with only slight variations. This, too, serves a purpose. But without any knowledge of Chinese history, worldviews, religion and superstition, chances are it's a bit much. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!My final gripe would be the cast of characters as such. Xuanzang, the Buddhist monk, the Emperor-decreed leader of the journey and chosen representative of the Empire, is whiny and prone to despair, although he is supposed to be an accomplished individual. Even worse, he makes multiple vows to trust his comrades more - most importantly, his disciple Sun - but quickly forfeits his determination on the next occasion. Sun Wukong is the rightful driver of the narrative and the most interesting and diverse character. However, this also means he is put in the spotlight 90% of the time. If he can't handle a situation and/or save his comrades from imminent death, the solution is usually a convenient trip to Bodhisattva Guanyin or - in later chapters - Buddha Tathagata himself. These two are by far the most annoyingly \"deus ex machina\" characters I have ever encountered in any medium.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Time and again, I have read that The Journey to the West is meant to teach the reader valuable life lessons. At the point in the story I am at, I am a bit shocked what lessons are apparently being taught. Lessons I agree with are:!&lt;\n\n1. &gt;!Don't cause trouble.!&lt;\n2. &gt;!Work to maintain peace and uphold order.!&lt;\n3. &gt;!If you can't fix it yourself, ask someone who can. !&lt;\n4. &gt;!If necessary, call the authorities.!&lt;\n5. &gt;!Don't give up when things are dire, keep going.!&lt;\n6. &gt;!Help others and you will receive help. More importantly, the divine powers will be on your side.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Lessons I disagree with are:!&lt;\n\n1. &gt;!Lying is bad, but you won't get anywhere without lying, so lie, lie as much as you must.!&lt;\n2. &gt;!Fight with honor. Footnote: It's also totally honorable to challenge your opponent to a duel and have your buddy ambush him. Two-on-one, three-on-one... Doesn't matter. This is especially true if a) your name is Sun Wukong, b) you look cool during the fight, c) it's funny, or d) all of the above. Seriously, you are on a divine mission for the same gods who told you lying is bad. So do what you must and entertain the readers along the way. As long as it's entertaining and you get to your goal, all will be forgiven.!&lt;\n3. &gt;!For the most part, there is only black and white. Either people are on a righteous path or they are not. The grey area inbetween is very, very slim.!&lt;\n4. &gt;!If someone falls under \"not righteous\", it's totally ok to kill or subdue them. They are less than insects. Remember, there are multiple levels of afterlife, ascension and rebirth. If they happen to be powerful, they may be powerful insects, but they are still insects. This generously applies to all who have a different perspective from \"the way things are supposed to be\", i.e. devotely serving Buddha and the celestial order, as epitomized in the Empire.!&lt;\n5. &gt;!Most who are \"not righteous\" are usually so by their own choice. Don't bother understanding them or educating them. It's rarely worth the effort. In those cases where it is worth the hassle, it's probably because the gods willed it to be so.!&lt;\n6. &gt;!It's awesome to rely on your network and to call on the higher-ups you know. Unless you have friends in the government who can get you out of a pinch (i.e. the Jade Emperor, divine ruler of all, or his near endless troops, or Bodhisattva Guanyin), you won't get very far.!&lt;\n7. &gt;!The Chinese civilization is the pinnacle of mortal existence. Everything else is either straight-up barbaric and wrong or halfway decent, at best.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I take it for granted that some of these may be my misunderstanding the content. That's also part of the reason why I read it: to learn and understand it better. My, it's the reason why I wrote such a long post :)!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe joys of reading this classic:\n\n&gt;!The last point above is where I feel the real value of The Journey to the West lies. Following Xuanzang and his disciples is not so much about experiencing their growth, although that's still part of it. It's about transporting a worldview. More than anything else, the Journey can teach readers today how people like Wu Cheng'en (whom the books are attributed to) perceived the Chinese Empire at the time and the world around it. Yes, it's made painfully clear that readers should accept the Empire as the only hospitable and most important place on earth (though there's still hell and the heavens). And for all I can say - that was the official narrative for as long as the Chinese Empire existed. So rather than presenting a plot with lots of action and drive (which there are), the Journey presents a worldview, maybe multiple worldviews, and is a window into Tang/Ming-dynastic China. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sadly, it is almost impossible to transport the original writing into any other language. Otherwise, the language itself would be a stellar treat. I undertook a number of attempts to read the Chinese original and began translating some of the poems. That alone already proved to be a daunting, yet highly rewarding task. But since I like to read and \"one verse per hour\" is not really my idea of pastime reading...!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As for the characters, I suggest to treat Xuanzang and his disciples not as individuals, but as fragments of one psyche that's trying to fit all the different temperaments of human existence. Here, I am so thankful for Eva Lüdi-Kong's annotations and I wish everyone reading this classis gets an equally thorough translation with useful remarks. They are a life saver! The Journey is rich with references to Chinese mythology, cosmology, and alchemy, not to mention Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. At some point, it became clear that Sun Wukong plays the role of the rambunctious heart, whereas his master Xuanzang is more aligned with reason - the heart's reins, so to speak. Zhu Bajie, despite being made the laughing stock on multiple occasions, is more than just a beast driven by instinct. More importantly, he displays a whole range of emotions, especially those that would be \"unbecoming\" for his comrades. Sha Wujing is usually a very quiet character and rarely gets the spotlight, but when he does, he keeps the group together and takes the role of a mediator. Finally, the dragon prince/dragon horse... I'm not yet decided on this one, but I remember one extremely cool scene that made me wish he would get more action. I suppose he, too, has a role to fulfill within the group, but I'm uncertain what it is.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Lastly, some of the scenarios are just epic. Or hilarious. Or both. Yes, such situations are far and few between, but some perils the group ends up in (or the solution) had me laughing out loud. It was also fun to see where Dragonball borrowed some of its ideas. Some of those inspirations were pretty surprising.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy verdict:\n\n&gt;!I will certainly finish the Journey. Yes, I'm kind of yearning for the conclusion at this point, but I still think it's a rewarding read. To all with an interest in China and/or literature, I recommend giving it a shot. I suppose some knowledge of Chinese history, religion, etc. helps. Is such knowledge neccessary to enjoy this classic... I'll give that a tentative \"maybe\". But whatever you do, don't expect an easy read. I know it's not a fair comparison, but I'll still say that I found Homer's Odyssey exceedingly easy to read compared to this - and by \"this\" I mean a translation in my mother tongue. I haven't read Tolstoi's War and Peace (yet), but something tells me that might still be easier to grasp.!&lt;",

        "text": "I posted this on r/books but thought it would be more appropriate here for discussion \n\nJustine by the Marquis de Sade is a great book. There, i said it. It is genuinely evil, perverted, misogynistic (too say the least), repetitive, completely lacks pacing, pretty dense. De Sade was a genuine psychopath, that deserved all 30ish years he went to prison for, he was also a r***ist and pedo. Justine is over the top and horribly pornographic, its no mystery to anyone why he is where the term sadism originated from. I know, great pitch huh\n\nBut he was also a genius. This is a philosophical novel, and it points out genuine critique and contradictions in christianity and the social morals that were popular at the time. this book will make you question why it is you choose to be moral, and why you have the morals you do. It builds a legitimate moral system out of vice, which before i didnt even know was allowed. I sure as hell do not agree with, or choose to follow, pretty much any of the philosophy given, nor do i think thats the point. I think De Sade wanted to create this novel to show that philosophy is completely heterogenous (as Bataille would put it), and to break us out of out limited societal values, although it is obvious that he also truly just wanted to spread evil and his horrible libertine teachings.\n\nThe writing is dense and repetitive, but i dont think thats a fair critique since this book wasn't made for entertainment (if anything, outside his philosophy, sexual arousal). Its a tough read but not necessarily badly written. He single handedly created transgressive literature, and went to prison for the last ten years of his life as a result. As someone whos a fan of french extremity and other transgressive underground movies and books, this is probably the only book that really lived up to its disturbing hype, probably because the evil was completely convincing. This is a weird book to say that you like, let alone call a favorite.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on de Sade?",

        "text": "I’m currently rereading The Alchemist, and though never mentioned by name, my theory is The Brothers Karamazov. It almost feels like an inside joke the author has with himself. \n\nWhen Santiago first starts reading it, he notes that the names are all introduced too quickly and are difficult to pronounce. This is the beggining of the joke to me because Santiago is the only character who has been introduced by this point. \n\nI’ve heard so many times that “everything you need to know about life is in The Brothers Karamazov.” Since both books have similar themes of free will and the individual’s relationship with faith/doubt, it almost feels like Coelho is saying “we can talk about all this same stuff in layman’s terms, chill Dostoevsky” \n\nMaybe I’m projecting - because Santiago also never gets more than a few pages in before finding it too convoluted, and that’s what I do with the Brothers K - but I’m curious if anyone else has any theories!",

Her wit is wonderful and she has a remarkably fresh layer of honesty in her depiction of the world. Now to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmy is perhaps the most complete villian I have ever seen. Her motivations are fleshed out both in the present in explaining her actions day to day as well as in her origin which is not absolving in the least but is incredibly enlightening.  Her intellect is astounding and her drive is unmatched.  Her final chapter is so well done. \"Just\" her getting the last word. But the chapter is not wasted at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNick is potentially the worst character I've have ever actively rooted for. Worst meaning terrible human being not poorly written. The line in his final chapter really summed up why he worked so well as a protagonist. Paraphrasing: \"I'm finally the hero. In a never ending battle with my antagonist wife.\" Gillian leaves Nick transformed but not redeemed. Nick admits that he loves Amy, essentially confirming her analysis of their love being cancer to each other. In doing so he supports at least a little of what Go says about him using the baby as an excuse. He does love Amy in a terribly twisted way and he can't see life without her. He is not uncorrupted or absolved. He is still a sociopath with Main character syndrome. However his actions are truly noble. In the end he says he is willing to lay down his life to undo all of the wrong things Amy will do to their child. And that action proves he is a good man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm blown away by this book.",

        "text": "*Comprendí que el trabajo del poeta no estaba en la poesía; estaba en la invención de razones para que la poesía fuera admirable*.\n—JLB\n\nEntramos en una sala con techos altos, la iluminación dorada y varias cortinas blancas y transparentes bajaban casi hasta rozar el suelo. Teníamos que hallar la luz, habían muchas, de cristal, de muchas formas, las había lisas y angulosas, también suaves como el terciopelo y con ondas amplias como las de un vestido de tela gruesa y pesada. Mirábamos siempre hacia arriba, los fugaces candiles se ocultaban entre las sábanas blancas. Vestíamos ropa blanca, con la textura del lino, y el piso era un mármol interminable, tibio. Por encima de nosotros, las luces blancas y doradas danzaban a nuestro paso; cerca del suelo, el juego incesante de luces y sombras parecía dibujar formas que no estaban allí. No veía el techo, no veía el piso y tampoco las paredes; adivinaba unas columnas como hechas de marfil, invisibles a mis ojos. Sin miedo de tropezar, mantenía la mirada en el origen de las luces, miraba arriba, y ella se acercaba con una cara indescifrable y ponía un beso en la comisura de mis labios. Caminaba lento, con sumo cuidado y moviendo con delicadeza las sedas que pendían de lo más alto. Con ambas manos y a destiempo, separé dos sábanas y vi la luz dentro de un cristal con forma de flor, una flor blanca, puesta del revés, con una luz dorada en su interior, era más brillante que el resto y podía verse el dibujo de un corredor por detrás. Miré a la luz unos segundos y de inmediato escuché un timbre que me hizo temblar las manos y tensar el cuello; provenía de todas partes. Con los pies descalzos y ahora húmedos daba pasos vacilantes hacia el trazo del corredor, cubierto por la seda. Me detuve centímetros antes, y me quedé estático ante la sábana. Abrí los ojos para comprobar ese laberinto, un viento cálido y suave agitó mis pestañas y descifré una barandilla blanca que ascendía hacia ninguna parte. Los pies dejaron de llevar mi cuerpo y me sentí cegado por el sol. Salí de entre las nubes, la escalera ya estaba cerrada y escuché alejarse el campanilleo de unas llaves. \n\n— Pedro Ximénez Saavedra.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nWhen searching for an interesting and significant book journey for this year, I finally selected Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”. It has so far intrigued me with its characters and the storyline and though I am not much ahead, I feel strongly about this one and determined to finish by summer.\n\nSome of the thoughts I have been having on the book are the current events around the globe. There are so many wars out there and so little peace in many countries. I would even say that with all the information and rapidness, there is lack of peace inside peoples’ minds and hearts. It is also interesting and sad to read a book of the Russian author during the course of the current events.\n\n“The misery of nations is caused not by particular persons, but by the particular order of Society under which the people are so bound up together that they find themselves all in the power of a few men, or more often in the power of one single man: a man so perverted by his unnatural position as arbiter of the fate and lives of millions, that he is always in an unhealthy state, and always suffers more or less from a mania of self-aggrandizement.” [para from W&amp;P]\n\nThe book gives so many life lessons I would wish everyone to listen to.\n\nMy recommendation for those people who want to read this book is to find a decent translation and suitable format and ask yourself why you want to read this book.\n\nThank you.",
