Was there a specific aspect of anthropology that you liked that was different from other fields? Or did it have more to do with your research topic, university advisers, previous experience, etc.? \n\nPerhaps a better question would be, did you have a research topic and choose anthropology because it would be the best way to answer your questions, or did you choose anthropology and then tailor your research topic to suit the field? \n\nThank you! \n\n\n",

That is all wonderful! But my question is this: Our unique consciousness also has made humans the only species that is aware of its own mortality. We know we are going to die. That is a terrible burden. True our civilization also evolved some religions that told us that we do not really die - and many of us cling to that. But why did evolution produce this knowledge of death and not provide any remedy? I have two thoughts on this:\n- one is that the evolution of our society required conscious individuals to build a knowledge base - remember the eating from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden was the moment when Adam and Eve realized they were naked.\n- the second thought is that Alzheimer's is actually evolution providing a remedy for awareness of death - not really different from being medicated - and we never had much awareness of of our earliest years of childhood either.

There are those people who crusade to defend their heroes by engaging in popular websites such as Wikipedia and dressing it up with bullshit, almost everyday.

What if you could bring someone from that time to the present day, will they become as smart as a modern day human?\n\nAnd if people did become more intelligent over time, did it happen gradually or there were huge spikes followed by long periods of stagnation? I ask this because i read an article that said that cooked food allowed us to evolve(not the Darwin kind) much quicker than the other living beings that do not cook their food, so i guess after people started cooking food there was a bit of a spike.\n\nAlso what about the fact that smart people today are having less children than people that are not that smart, is that having an impact on the intelligence level of humanity?\n\nThank you all for reading and i wish you a great day.",

Presumably again in ancient times people started having sex as soon as they reached sexual maturity, like every other species on the planet. Given that pregnancy before the age of 15 is considered risky, does this mean that a female would usually suffer from stillbirths, miscarriages and other problems before a successful pregnancy?\n\nI appreciate any responses",

So, in my understanding, race, on a biological level, is an arbitrary division into groups of the human race, done by selecting certain parameters to break up the continuums of phenotype variation, like, for example, eye color, or likelihood of contracting certain diseases. On a societal level, race is once again an arbitrary division of humans based on appearance, and also, on culture, and place of origin. So race is a construct, as it's arbitrary, but as any other system to group people, it can be used as a tool to study people and is not inherently good or bad, as it is just a tool.",

It's also ideological as I believe most if not all human made inventions are detrimental in one way or another, but let's not get into that.

I'm a fruitarian living on very low calorie intake so food wouldn't be a big concern. As I see people around me going bananas without some technological outlet or someone to talk to about current events, I wonder how traditional people spent their days and what their conversations were about, when the massive amount of information we have today is absent. What are the topics of conversations? I guess it's generally about finding food, mating, gossiping, playing, making jokes (about what? a grizzly bear walked into a bar? I ask seriously) dancing/singing/crafting. Obviously some philosophical/religious/mystical stuff as humans can't live without it. But could those fill in a whole day, every day? A \"job\" tends to occupy most of one's time, but when most (all?) jobs are removed, what people do with their free time?

        "text": "Hi!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that this subreddit existed, I recently followed some paleoanthropologists on Twitter and was watching some CARTA videos about the role of hunting. I come from the r/ketoscience and r/zerocarb subreddits \\- which talk about having very low carbohydrate diets of mostly meat and the modern science trying to uncover how these diets effect modern humanity\\(it's positive\\). I was curious about what the consensus positions are in this subreddit. What positions do people take? What kind of drama exists in the field overall as it relates to human nutrition and evolution? Based on my research, it seems that humans shared an ancestor in Africa with other apes 5\\-8 million years ago but became human through eating a meat\\-based diet while relying on hunting and scavenging, and their bodies, minds, community, and metabolism changed to become apex predators. \n\n* How long has the evolving human species eaten meat according to the best of our knowledge?\n* How much meat was eaten as a percentage compared to plants/fungi and what changed the percentages over time? Evolution and adaptation.\n* Should we think of ourselves as carnivorous herbivores or herbivorous carnivores? Or to joke: today's carbivorous carnivores? \n* What big questions still need to be answered?\n* Is it worth thinking about paleo nutrition to 'fix' modern nutrition?\n* What specific features did we evolve to become better hunters? Or did we become better hunters by evolving other traits for other reasons? \n* Did the race evolve in the state of ketosis\\(compared to relying on carbohydrates for energy for long periods of time/generations\\)? \n\nAre there any great books that discuss these topics that I need to read? I know of Wrangham and some of the paleo/keto doctors but was looking for the hardcore science books \\- for instead a whole book about the evolution of scapulas would be fascinating to me. \n\nI can also answer any questions you have for me as they relate to eating an all\\-meat carnivore diet or the science of ketosis and reversing chronic disease by limiting carbohydrates and seed oils. \n\nThanks so much!\n\nu/dem0n0cracy",
