        "text": "After watching the Winter Olympics for a few days now, I'm starting to see the sheer amount of opportunities for a BM Episode. Call me crazy, but there's several reasons behind my justification.\n\n* **Technology** - After the drone post that came to this sub reddit a few days ago, I noticed the sheer amount of cameras in literally every direction. Yes, it's the Olympics and it needs to be recorded, but it's also a global event watched by millions. I feel that an episode could be similar to a White Bear concept, where everyone is being watched.\n\n* **Corruption** - The Olympics have been prone to various types of corruption in the past, drugs, match fixing etc. I feel there's alot of wrong-doing that we are oblivious to/have no knowledge of, and for that side of the Olympics to be revealed would be entertaining.  \n\n* **Competition** - In general, the Olympics is the best of the best. There is no higher achievement for an athlete than winning the Olympics. Similar to 15 Million Merits, I feel that Brooks could create an extended metaphor somehow, on how the athletes are just trying to be better than each other. Linking to Nosedive, athletes are striving to be the best, figuratively gain a \"better rating\".",

All the episodes I've seen so far have been kind of morally ambiguous or definitely wrong/right, this is the first episode I personally found myself genuinely unsure of what the moral \"high ground\" was. This was also the first episode that I genuinely did not predict something until the moment it was about to happen. First it leads off with total government surveillance, and in a few seconds it presents the pros and cons to it. That they're spying on the public, but have \"prevented mass shootings and bombings\". With information like that how can a solid train of logic still say whether one side or the other is correct? And the game of who to kill. I found that probably was a commentary on how people basically already do that today, where oftentimes one single person who has not really done something wrong, or just something stupid, finds themselves being bombarded by thousands, or even millions, of unknown people. That there are no consequences. I feel like I agree that there should be consequences, but death? Even still I understand that from a purely logical point of view as study after study has shown that behaviors are both nature and nurture. So effectively committing Genocide of cruel people would significantly reduce cruelty. But the fact they even put a number to the amount reenforces how ingrained it is into society to be cruel, 387,000 people in just 3 days had used that hash tag. That episode just really struck a chord with me personally and I feel presented enough logic to make it difficult for someone to say which of the extremes is better in the situation provided.\n\nI don't really care if this gets removed I just needed to write this down somewhere where hopefully even one person will see it since it's 1:30 AM where I'm at currently üòÖ",

When the crew was fleeing into the wormhole why didn't Daley just exit game and pull the goddamn internet connection instead of chasing them in a slow in-game ship?\n\n3.

        "text": "I'm a big fan of everything this show did until it passed to netflix.\nSeason 4 was really bad compared to the already pretty shameful season 3 imo.\nHow did we go from to the complex universe building of \"15 million Merits\" to \"BOI TECH BE SPOOKY\". Seriously every episode before season 3 wasn't about how tech is bad or tried to shock you with cheap stuff. \nThe first 7 episode were a excellent psycho drama about humanity in the age of technology, they never lacked subtlety, they were in good tase, never derivative. The drama, the shock and the scare never came from technology itself but from the human element or even human interaction and how these were corrupted it by Spectacle (15 million merits), Media (The National Anthem or The Waldo Moment), Loss (I'll Be Back), Isolation (White Christmas) ecc. This corruption was delivered THROUGH technology not BY technology. What made me feel sick during \"I'll Be Back\" wasn't the thought of the bot becoming indipendent and killing her, it was the thought of him doing everything she wanted,  the thought of her replacing the reality of the loss with the fakeness of a bot. After that? Fucking psycho bees? Upvoting people? My mom seing what I see? Playing a videogame that was too realistic? \nThis show literally made me so sick (in a good way) that after \"The Entire History of You\" that I didn't sleep, it wasn't the gimmick of the week, it was the crescendo of him going crazy over his obsession to the point of forcing himself to watch his wife having sex with another man.  Even if both he and she were at wrong, I empathized with both so it wasn't forced, it was ambigously realisitic. \nThe details plus were great but still subtle in every episode, thanks to them you could still theorize and at the same time they served the purpose to build the universe, always from the \"entire history of you\": think on how much they drank in that episode, how liam was greeted into the house, the discussion in front of the babysitter and how he involuntarily revealed a joke about her... All this stuff made a black mirror episode, all this stuff made it realistic and ACTUAL and thus scary. What's scary about fucking killer bees? How is that technology even practical? It's an episode about online vigilantes? I don't have twitter, I'm safe. I never felt safe during the first 7 episodes, never. Even when the show tried to get political in \"the waldo moment\" it gave me goosebumps and was able at the same time to make a deep sociopolitical commentary. \nLet me talk a bit about this episode now because I feel it's been misunderstood even but it's own creators. This episode did not predicted trump or at least not in the way you think. If you think that the political discourse in america and in the rest of the world was single handedly destroyed by trump you are an idiot. Trump like waldo was a consequence of perceived dishonesty and sense of malaise from the population. Like trump waldo was a pop culture \"icon\" in its country. Like trump waldo was a show\"man\". The analogies do end here tho, if you remember the episode ending, before the epilogue, waldo didn't win the election but he had control over the masses. The climax was when the protagonist left the waldo van and showed himself infront of the public who didn't belived him. It wasn't an episode about how \"one day an asshole will become the most powerful guy/thing in the world\" because it was really actual. Big corporations/governments already do put in frontline likable \"outsiders\" (Woman, actors, blacks ecc.)  who speak like the people with language of the people. It's no different from Reagan, will be no different if Oprah if she runs, will/was no different from one of the hundred jokes candidates around the world or talk show hosts with \"pointy\" thongs. The point of this episode was that the other two candidates were losing because they were not percived as incorrect or comedic enough from the people. The girl is the only one who really wanted to do good,  through wrong means tho (again ambiguity), is percived as too posh and dishonest (which she is) and can't really do anything because she's new and not in a position of power doesn't even get to speak during the debate scene. There is no chance of steering from the masses though, there is only chance to speak in an incorrect way through anonymity like waldo does. Again he's outing an exposing of her during the debate wasn't about him not agreeing politically with her but rage about the fact that she didn't pick up the phone. The anxiety of the protagonist causes all the events but you still feel bad for him, he's a tragic and a little patetic figure. He's a low tier, unfunny comedian who's gimmick gets used to first get more ratings and then enslave the population. His anxieties, insecurities and social fobias became real in the climax scene, that's what makes that scene so good: this is black mirror. Socio politcal commentary makes the dystopia  dystopia  + psycho drama about the consequences on human interaction makes the horror.\nI just want to add another thing: the epilogue where we se Waldo everywhere was a bit too on the nose but useful, the scariest part was before that in the hospital where he watches the result of on tv. Waldo DOES not win, but though how easily a guy acts as soon as waldo orders to throw a shoes we understand that he has control over the masses, then it fades to black. The worst is yet to come. Now this is fucking scary  (btw I think you should read manufacturing consense to get the episode a lot better)\nI talked about this episode because I feel like Charlie Broker thought that his job after  the special was to \"predict what's gonna happen\" and I think this is in part to the fact that people say that black mirror predicted trump. That \"predict what's gonna happen\" totally killed it for me. Charlie, don't predict shit. Talk about the present through dystopic lens that's what this show was about. \nThe other thing that really bothers me is how the american press that ignored the show when was on channel 4 now acts all excited for the dumbed down version of it, people will watch probably some episodes from the 3rd or 4th season an give the same amount of attention to the first two who deseve better. Plus the format of netflix doesn't help neither, If i watch more than one episode a day imho you lose all the impact. Infact this was the only show I followed weekly and feel good about it. I had time to think about it. To feel it. To try to digest the trauma, but the putting the details in the head togheter didn't let it go down. It was haunting in every sense. \n\nIs everything in the new seasons bad? Nono. I like how they are trying new genres and there are a few good episodes here and there (all through nothing like the first 7). I just think what nosedive or san junipero would be like with the quality writing and care for the details of the orginal. \nYeah Black Mirror is the new Twilight Zone, no doubt about that... But if the show continued the direction of those 7 first and improved them slightly with new genres and more budget, Black Mirror would have easily been one of the all time greats on tv and surely the most terrifying show in history\n\nEdit: Don't go heavy on me.

I've been trying to get my BF into it, and by random chance the ones we happened to watch were San Junipero (\"a bit boring, not as dark as you said Black Mirror was\") and Arkangel (\"too predictable\"). \n\nI feel like we happened to watch slower episodes without any big twists, so any advice on a good last episode to try before he may give up forever? The episode that probably got me the most was Shut up and dance, but that is probably a bit slow again.\n\nThanks!",
