        "text": "S.O.M.A. is a post-apocalyptic piece of horror science fiction.  It is supposed to entertain you by scaring the shit out of you.  That is the sole, exclusive purpose.  \n\nIt does not propose anything that should shape your view of trans-humanism.  It is science-*fiction*.  That second word is extremely important.\n\nI want to put this out there largely to address the fears of 'mind-copying' which keep coming up.\n\nOne of the primary goals of preserving the mind is to preserve continuity of consciousness.  There is nothing in S.O.M.A. about doing that.  NOTHING.  Continuity of consciousness is very important to most transhumanists.  If you're not *you*, then you aren't really living forever, now are you?\n\nWhat most people frightened of brain-scanning and mind-copy are afraid of is losing their 'soul'.  \n\nThat is where the fear stems from.  It's not dying that makes them afraid.  It's losing their individual unique magical spirit while something else continues on in the real world which looks and acts like them, but isn't them.  \n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers wouldn't be such an effective movie without this fear and it is innate in most people above a certain level of societal advancement.  Defining what and where the soul might be is pointless, since we have no evidence whatsoever for the existence of the soul, but most people are terrified of losing it.\n\nS.O.M.A. plays on this fear.\n\nThe mind-copy methods employed in S.O.M.A. are *obscene* and backwards.  There have been many, many better methodologies suggested that allow a person to copy themselves and preserve continuity of consciousness.\n\nWhat this comes down to is self-valuation.  If you have five bodies, all of them yours, then one of them breaking down might be an inconvenience...but that's all it is.  If you only have *one* body and it breaks down then...well, you're fucked.\n\nCollective intelligence is one excellent method of preserving an individual mind.  Say you clone a person four times and then the five clones regularly plug themselves into a computer which shares all five of their experiences.  Yes, it would be sad if one broke, but their experiences would be preserved in four other bodies.\n\nIf that doesn't do it for you, then consider simulated body exchange.  You connect your brain to a clone body, then use that body from day to day over a period of weeks to acclimatize to it.  When your own body breaks down, the clone body survives with your consciousness in it.\n\nWe could take it a step further.  You operate a simulated body, rather than a clone body.  That is to say, a body within a simulation.  You hook your brain up to the simulation's brain and take input directly into your sensory centers.  At a point, your un-simulated body breaks down and you continue to operate the simulated body.\n\nWhat this is about is stripping value from the idea of the *soul*.  If the soul exists, no new body you take on can ever be yours.  Your soul is gone.  \n\nThe soul is *horse shit* perpetuated by religious authorities to keep you afraid.  That's all it is.  Nothing else.  Your individuality and consciousness are transferable and *will* be lost upon your death, one way or the other.  If you choose to die for fear of losing your soul, then that is your choice, but it sounds downright silly to me that one should make that decision based on a *video game*.\n\nEDIT: Could someone who is downvoting this present me with the reason they're downvoting it?",

        "text": "Good Afternoon! Been active in the transhumanist community for a while, but needing a discussion and brainstorming session about Transhumanist Education.\n\nEducation (especially K-12) is one of the areas most lacking adequate scientific attention. While it may not be at the top of the list of priorities for the transhumanist community - compared to the medical domain, or philosophy and the social sciences - nonetheless it is fundamental to creating a better world. Additionally, the general population against transhumanism, life extension technologies, BCIs, etc. are likely so against it all, from my experience, because (A) they are not working in those fields, or (B) are unaware that our efforts at technological development are anything other than science fiction. The only way around both of these issues is to participate in education policy reform efforts and curriculum development.\n\nNote: I'm grossly understating and under-discussing these issues for simplicity sake, to get to the main question, namely:\n\n\n(1) What would a transhumanist curriculum look like? How could it be different/better?\n(2) What would transhumanist education policy look like? How could it be different/better?\n(3) What steps could we take to reform either education policy and/or curriculum guidelines to reflect and/or encourage transhumanism?\n\n\nMy initial comments:\n\nIn regard to policy, I myself am an advocate of funding (either as a government or non-profit initiative) the creation of an ARPA-ED here in the U.S., and see that as something of a priority, especially for transhumanists. Discussions of this have re-arisen very recently from the ashes of the efforts failed attempt in Congress a few years ago. Also, taking away education from the states and making its administration a federal effort *could* be a good idea to increase the quality of that education in regard to the interoperability of our education and learning systems... I mean, aviation as a federal program works damn well, defense as a series of federal programs manages to keep its head above water, so why not education? Also.. what about the transhumanist community even supporting a ban of state/federal funding for religious charter schools? If religious groups want to brainwash children about something not productive for society, they should do it on their own dime - your thoughts?\n\n\nIn regard to curriculum development, I see transhumanism as needing to support the implementation of innovative perspectives such as the \"Big History Project\" into our history curriculums, in mandating the recognition of programming as an option for K-12 secondary language requirements, and in generally supporting the scientific improvement of curriculum development. Shouldn't the transhumanist community be a main source advocating for the replacement of traditional classrooms through the use of intelligent automated tutors capable of individualizing each student's education?\n\nPlease let me know what you think about all this, let me know if you support education as a significant domain for transhumanist intervention (much like medicine!), and also, what your visions of a transhumanist education system and transhumanist curriculum would look like!\n\nThanks!",

The Gattaca argument (genetic divide) is an example of one such criticism and I'm looking for responses to those kinds of criticisms.\n\nThere are two I know of but I'm looking for more.  The first is that the trend in technological progress indicates that it would only be a short time between when new technologies are first made available and when they are cheap enough for everyday people to afford, so there won't actually be a problem.  The other response grants that the criticism is a real problem and proposes government policy to prevent that divide from cementing.  Social democracy is one such policy proposal.\n\nI don't believe either of these responses sufficiently address this criticism so I'm looking for stronger responses to it.  I'm looking primarily for responses by well known transhumanists but if you have a response of your own I'd love to hear it.\n\nedit:  I need to clarify my own version of this criticism of transhumanism.  It is true that technological progress tends to make modern technology more accessible to everyday people but the wealth divide is very real and appears to be growing.  The key to this criticism is that wealth better enables the wealthy to increase their wealth (i.e. increasing that divide) and with exponentially developing technology the wealthy can cement their position faster than the general public can resist a growing class divide.\n\nWhat are the transhumanist responses to this problem?",

Being natural does not make something good.  \n\n*Mortality is part of what it means to be human.\"*\n\nDid you agree to be human?  You need to decide what your own nature is, no one has the right to tell you that you are obligated to adhere to some arbitrarily-defined \"human nature\".\n\n*Death is otherwise good or desirable.*\n\nIf you truly believe this, then why haven't you just gone and jumped off a bridge?  I'll answer this question for you: you're still here because you have something to live for.  There is something in the world important enough to you to make you want to keep existing in it.  Do you expect that to just change at some point around the arbitrarily-defined end of your lifespan?\n\n*Knowledge of mortality is the only thing that makes people do good things.*\n\nThis is no different than the \"atheism is bad because you need religion to be a good person\" arguments, and is refuted in the same way.  If knowledge of your mortality and fear of being remembered poorly is the only thing convincing you to be a good person, then you are by definition not a good person.  Furthermore, knowledge of mortality (and in particular desire to be rewarded in the afterlife) has throughout history driven just as many unspeakable atrocities as acts of heroism.\n\n*Overpopulation.*\n\nI think that very few people will deny that overpopulation is the greatest existential threat to humanity.  But executing people through depriving them of the right to extend their lives for the crime of using more than a given allotment of resources is not the answer.\n\nArguably, knowing that you will be around for much longer will even promote a sense of environmental stewardship.  It's no longer \"the next generation's\" problem.  Speaking of...\n\n*We need to make room for the next generation.*\n\nI'll be blunt with this one.  Do you think people have an obligation to die for the sake of a bunch of hypothetical people who don't exist yet?\n\n*It will never work.*\n\nPerhaps not, but if that's your attitude then you'll never know for sure.",

When we were all reading William Gibson as kids, we saw this possibility of a dark future where corporations had all the power, there was a web that people could access, credit was the most important aspect of a person to society and people were enhanced by machines. Well that future stopped being possible, became probable then happened. For the common person, these were pessimistic visions of the future that have come to pass basically.\n\nNow enter Transhumanism. this, in my estimation, is a very optimistic view of the future for the common person. There are some of the same elements, but the access to the technology seems to be ubiquitous and affordable in theory rather than sparse and expensive, as in Cyberpunk theories. I am just beginning to engage Transhumanism as a theoretical framework and I need some expert analysis by those who know both Cyberpunk and Transhumanist social theories. My questions are these:\n\n1. Is Transhumanist social theory informed by Cyberpunk social theory? Is it an outgrowth or are they completely independent?\n\n2. Is the social mood of a bleak future vs. a bright, optimistic future enough to compare the two?\n\n3. Is generation the main determining factor in that social outlook?\n\nMy nerdy friends an I are attempting to establish a continuum utilizing these theoretical frameworks as a way to try and predict or generalize what is coming next. We would use the frameworks of Modernism, Postmodernism and Posthumanism as a control continuum. Help?\n\n",

Capitalism have failed in many ways now , and I'm sure that some (or even perhaps many) of you know what I'm really talking about here. \n\nSo in conclusion, that's why I think that if we , Humanity / Mankind / Humans Civilization really want the REAL Progress , then we must TRANSCEND beyond this stupid &amp; limiting biological , emotional , &amp; primordial Human Nature , and the real answer / real key / real solution therefore is : Transhumanism / Transhumanist / Transhuman project . \n\nWhat do you all think ? \nAnd also, what we must DO then , to turn it into reality ? \n\nthank you.\n",

        "text": "I for one think we need to fundamentally change the way we organise our global society to not be so blindly accepting of death. \n\nA small fraction of people currently have a small chance of being bought back to life after death and perhaps not having to die again, at least not ceasing to exist until the heat death of the universe if we don't find a way around it. People signed up for cryonics have this opportunity. \n\nI think every human alive should have this opportunity, I also think we shouldn't blindly bring humans into existence just to eventually die and as such we should limit population growth. I think we should cryopreserve everyone who dies and limit the population of the planet to less than ~1 billion people.\n\nI believe we should make cryonics the standard procedure at the end of life. I have noticed I am not the first person to think of this idea, Ralph Merkle has suggested it here: http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/cryopreservingeveryone.html\n\nHis ideas are very good and definitely provide a good skeleton for the way we should go about cryopreserving everyone. However I think we should think of an alternative to compromising the quality of cryopreservation by using field cryopreservation technology, in that we should try and think of an alternative which results in better than the local cryopreservation quality we can currently achieve and continously improves with time. \n\nI believe we should start cryopreserving everyone as soon as possible and that it is definitely possible to start doing it soon because all the techniques are already in place. \n\nWe need to rally more support for this idea. \n\nIt is a much better alternative to just giving up at death and disposing of peoples bodies so they never have a chance of coming back. Even if there is only a chance with cryonics its far better than none at all. \n\nI also think we should fund much more money into anti aging research and organisations such as Humai, The SENS Research Foundation and 2045 Initiative as well as mind uploading research. If we can eliminate death we will no longer need to cryopreserve any more people other than those who are already preserved. If we can radically extend life span we will need to cryopreserve people less frequently until indefinite life extension is achieved.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on bringing about these radical changes?",

        "text": "I am only vaguely familiar with transhumanism, but one thing I cannot quite figure out is why becoming some boundless God-like entity is even desirable.\n\nI hear people talking about doing reverse entropy research (because, presumably, they want to live *forever and ever*), and I don't really understand what this would look like - sit down and let your mechanical 'brain' run for a few millennia?\n\nThe other one that baffles me is the idea that disembodied consciousnesses would have any need for a society. If you're feeling lonely, why not simulate your own company? If there exists a desire to become all-powerful and everlasting, why would we seek to complicate our lives with unknown factors other than to flirt with the limitations of our power and knowledge (presumably other consciousnesses would be 'unknown' to us, sort of like subnetworks on the internet)?\n\nWhen you can learn everything just by downloading it, where does limitation come from? What purpose can you direct yourself to when you are essentially all-powerful, and why would it be likely that such all-powerful consciousnesses would be cooperative rather than adversarial?\n\nFinally, how would abandoning the human form impact perceptions of time? Presumably an increased cognitive capacity allows for more to be observed in a shorter amount of time, thus 'slowing down' time, but wouldn't the ability to essentially automate all of your actions without any need for what we might recognize as toil or boredom result in the whole journey going relatively quickly if you don't manage to crack entropy in that time frame?\n",
