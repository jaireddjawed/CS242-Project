And the fact that I can be exposed to the most unhinged opinion at any minute. I grew so tired of it I just deactivated my account impulsively. Didn‚Äôt even hesitate and haven‚Äôt looked back since. I‚Äôm better off without that hellish app.\n\nInstagram is much of the same. People and their itch to constantly share everything about their lives, it‚Äôs so unhealthy. I got to a point where I only used to message other people. So I decided I was done with that too. People can message me elsewhere. \n\nI used to scroll on Twitter for hours, watch reels mindlessly scrolling without realising the damage I was doing to my brain. I‚Äôve honestly had some very peaceful days since getting rid of those apps. I‚Äôve been reading more, gone outside for walks, just generally enjoyed my days a lot more. And I feel better about myself too.\n\nSo yeah. I guess just wanted to get that off my chest. Where better than Reddit?

        "text": "Hey, 20M. My whole life, I was a bit of a physical late bloomer, ugly duckling, whatever you could call it. Now I have a slightly feminine but attractive appearance and the difference in how I get treated is without a doubt noticeable.\n\nI've always struggled with self esteem and got bullied a lot, now that's over. But now I'm stuck between wanting to be alone and feeling like I have to make a million connections for my life to mean anything. I'm so easily distracted with my academic and career stuff that as much as I want to focus on it I am always searching for the next easy dopamine hit. By any means possible - from casual social media overload in class to alcohol.\n\nSomehow I just know I haven't learned to love myself. Every time I go out for a date or group social outing with people I don't know, I take a few shots just so I can feel like I'm going through it like a normal person. Or maybe Phenibut that day, or just something so that I'm not going in detached and shy. \n\nI started university on a very small campus and it felt like I was always watched and judged, even as I grew some friends that I could rely on. I couldn't carefully manage my impressions because I see people I know everywhere and I would be too distracted to focus on other people in the environments where real connections come - classes, extracurriculars, etc.\n\nBut, due to other circumstances, I am in NYC this semester. One hilariously awkward encounter with a girl I kept running into taught me my lesson in my other location, but it felt like I was suddenly in anonymous paradise.\n\nImmediately, I got Tinder Gold, Bumble, and Hinge. I've had a few hookups and have rapidly matured over the past two years from a kissless virgin at 18. But none of that has resulted in anything meaningful beyond one FWB situation. I tell myself that these aren't the right circumstances in my life and most importantly I'm not really good enough for someone to see all parts of me.\n\nIn New York, there are plenty of people so even as a man I get plenty of matches. Probably over a hundred between all the apps in the last month. But no matter how promising a conversation seems to be going - I think texting is my strong suit, anyway - there's always the risk that it just drops dead at any moment. And I respect people when we've made plans and I am not going to rearrange them except for emergency circumstances but clearly it's never mutual.\n\nI met three people last weekend. One girl just told me her roommate was gone and invited me over at 11pm on a Friday and we hooked up. Stayed the night but I think I just felt a bit dirty afterwards, honestly. On Saturday I met a girl and our vibes just seemed to mesh together, that one actually has some promise for this weekend. On Sunday I had a long date that seemed to go well but it was a daytime market date so I wanted to take it slow, especially because she lives in my dorm and I could run into her if anything goes wrong. We agreed on dinner today, then of course she flaked last minute.\n\nThere's just such a bizarre disconnect between the feeling of a date that's supposed to be a relaxed time and knowing that they have infinite options and will drop you as soon as you show the slightest hint of insecurity. And I realized that I'm bemoaning this while I'm meeting three different people in a single weekend. But what else is there to do? If I genuinely focus on getting to know one person that person won't be doing the same. I had a weekend once while traveling where I planned to meet three different people - like arranged a time and location - and ALL flaked. Treating people and their time with respect feels like a losers' game.\n\nAnd, moreover, it feels like I'm almost relying my social life on this. I have conditioned myself for so long that starting a conversation organically with someone is just wrong or unnatural. It's a busy, cutthroat atmosphere in a lot of my university classes and I'm not here for long enough to really immerse myself in events. But even in a small campus with a lot more intimate vibes I just complained about the suffocatingness of that so I don't know what I really want.\n\nAt first, I was surprised that I succeeded on apps being a shy late bloomer and it was validation that I actually wasn't ugly and doomed to be alone. But even as I've gained sexual experience I've come no closer to understanding myself. I could use that excuse for the first month I was on Tinder though, but not now. There's really no endgame, it looks like I'm just going to keep swiping and then be stuck inside when my plans fail. I've even underinvested in real friendships just to chase pussy, for fuck's sake. Perhaps I'm very impatient and even if the swipe nature of an app is dehumanizing, I love the immediacy and lack of ambiguity. I'm going to talk myself out of escalating with someone I 'know' organically.\n\nHow I come off to people in an organically developing situation is still quite shy and introverted. I have come convinced that a lot of people at my main university campus dislike me and as a result I kind of... dislike them back? I tell myself I can't talk to them because they'll just want me to go away so they can get back to their circle. I don't know why I refuse to depend on others and insist on this 'lone wolf' mentality. Often the worries with cold approach / conversational type things is being creepy. I still fear this but the vibe I give off is the opposite issue. I've been told I look \"innocent\" and \"harmless\" multiple times. Creepy: zero. Part of that is the halo effect, of course, but I need to evaluate what I'm working with.\n\nThis is really an insidious trap. Well-played to the designers of Tinder and all these other apps, because I convince myself I'm missing out when I deactivate them and don't see 'opportunities' around me. I love writing, hope to commiserate with people, and hope this rant didn't turn out too long.",

        "text": "\\*if you have the time to read the whole thing, please let me know your honest opinion because i need advice, I'm scared and i just need some guidance\\* \n\nI recently turned 22 and for the past year i feel like I've been living a double life, slowly and steadily destroying everything I've worked for in a spiral of self-sabotage and disassociation. ever since i was a child, i have been working the system to achieve what i want, figuring out how to achieve what i want with whatever i have and whatever loophole i can find, and i think a huge part of this is bc i had undiagonised adhd for a majority of my life so i was just tryna cope with what means I can find, however over the past couple of years i feel like this \"superpower\" has done away, my lies used be a vehicle for manifestation and push me forward and now i feel like I've lost the will to catch up and slowly they are swallowing me alive. \n\nit started in 2019 when i joined engineering as a major, not my true hopes and dreams but i knew i loved tech from the conferences i had been to and could push through even tho math and science didn't come as easily to me as english or history, etc did. failed my first semester, then covid hit so i went back home and i was able to pass my classes and then when things calmed down i came back to my uni town and started doing poorly again and started coping with weed and became a full-blown stoner, this was never me, i have been a high achiever, great student my whole life, sudden i was a fucking degenerate, why was life so hard since i came to uni? i went into therapy, got help, got diagnosed for adhd, started meds and started to take control of my life. \n\nI started to network in the tech space and make opportunities for myself, this how I discovered my love for design, and i was making money, finally doing something for myself even tho school was still so hard; it got to a point where i felt successful enough to dropout and move to NYC and had enough money and jobs to make it happen. \n\nand then everything went to shit at the end of 2021.\n\nI went home to help my family move and finish the rest of the semester online and decided once December exam season ended, I would take a gap semester off to see if my design work could turn into something bigger, but that is not how things planned out. \n\nmy parents were not ready to move, they have their own pile of issues but this new life step really brought it, suddenly i was expected to drop everything to help them and as the oldest i just felt like i couldn't say no, on top of that a week later my dad wanted to get a dog, even tho my mom knew she would be doing most of the work and he promised that he would do 50/50 but that was no true; i wasn't too sure about it but i was like I'm not gonna be here soon like yall can deal with this. when the dog came i spent most of my time raising him bc i fell in love with in him within a day, he was a messy crazy lab but i didn't care, i felt like our souls bonded.\n\nthen my grandparents moved in with us bc that's how it goes in a lot of POC cultures and they're from my dad's side so you know they were mean to my mom when my parents were younger and now everyone acts like nothing happened bc they're frail but they're still naraccists and my dad just cant see that bc he's been brainwashed his whole life. this lead to a lot of trauma over 2022, fights, abuse, and it really fucked me up. everything i wanted to do and create, i dropped it all, all i did was get in between my parents fight and try to survive another, i started secretly smoking again, and then only thing that got me through another day was my dog, i was filled with pain and rage, and took that out on my work, i stopped replying to people, fulfilling my commitments, and went from a young talent with lots of potential to the girl who always uses her mental issues and life as an excuse to be irresponsible and procrastinate. i know that its not my parents fault and that a lot of people see a sorts of fucked up shit and are so successful and don't ruin their lives, i don't know, i cant even tell you what i was thinking, i lost track of time, a day or week of not replying turned into a year nad now theres some people and commitments that i haven't responded to in like 12+ months. i decided in the summer that i would come back to school so i could get out of that house so that i could can at least get a part time job, study, make some money, start designing again, and make amends with the people i hurt.  and then turns out the place i sublet lied to me and i found out when i moved in that they had a huge bedbug infestation, i got reactions everyday and started to not sleep and go crazy until we got rid of them, which took all of last semester, so ofc i didn't work, sleep, anything. \n\nand the worst part is now I've used up all my savings and the line of credit i opened for school so i basically have to live paycheck to paycheck for the first time ever, how did i get here. and you know what, now my parents wanna give up the dog, so it frees them to get a divorce or at least separate for a big even though they promised to keep him until i got back on my feet then i could take him. they found a good family and everything, and i know I'm just in my early 20s and the dreams of being a fast-paced design and tech creative require me to being working all the time and travelling and that is what i want for my life but i cant imagine anyone else being my dog's pet parent, it makes me want to puke and the air leaves my lungs when i think about it. i know i sound dramatic but i was the one who stepped up for this dog when my parents couldn't, he was the one who saved me when everything was going down, i feel like our souls were meant to meet, how can someone else raise him for the next 10 years?? just bc my parents are finally getting their shit together and want to move forward, now he has to go, i know its not fair to hold them back for him and they will live better lives once they have the freedom to go their own way but please i cant lose my dog, why was all of this for nothing, but at the same time there's a voice in my head that is saying i don't care enough about my big dreams if i cant let go of this dog. my whole life is a fucking mess and its all my fault. how am i supposed to make amends professionally, get an internship, get money so I'm not broke anymore, i just have too many problems and each one needs the other to be fixed and its just too late. I've fucked everything up, please just give me advice, real talk, i just need help, I'm so scared I'm crying as i write this, how did it get to this point. i cant even tell my friends bc they still assume I'm making as money as i did a year ago, no one knows I've fucked up so bad what do i do",

For context, I am admittedly very much not knowledgeable about fitness or going to the gym, so I would have never guessed on pricing.\n\nThe only other big gym in my area is a Planet Fitness. If there is one thing I have heard about this chain, it's that it's despised by the fitness community. However, I'm not looking for anything hardcore at the moment, just enough for running or basic weights. Both membership plans I saw looked way cheaper.\n\nDo I go with the cheap option, or fork over more for a better experience?\n\nI'd like to add that if there is a better sub for this kind of question, please let me know.",

And I've came to this conclusion that I shouldn't expect anything. LITERALLY ANYTHING from people. Cause they'd all disappoint you. No matter how small or tiny the expectation is. They can easily forget everything, like how good you were before, and they'd be so happy to see you fail. Even the ones you thought you could count on as \"somehow-friends\" they don't usually show it but it's so damn obvious. And they are like so over confident. They think they are the best But they sure are not. And this is about almost everyone most people don't show it, or like act the exact opposite and they are always like \"nooo I'm not good at this\" but who are they fooling anyways TT ?\n\nYes I've also decided that I should distance myself from people. Like literally. Mostly and specially at school. I should move my sit to another place where I'm alone and all by myself. And in the break times I'd find an empty place to be or just act like I'm busy so people would go and stop talking to me.\n\nGod it's so tiring why are pope like this T-T\n\nAnd yk this way they don't make me full of self-doubt and stuff. It's way much better. Wish I had never talked to them at all.( yk I'm talking about the people in my school)\n\nLike they can mind their own business why'd they have to talk behind my back and then talk to me like we are friends. If you don't like me tell me so. You don't have to do all that shit.\n\nIt's not that I hate people. Well yeah I do but it's because how most if them act and behave, it's so hard to find a good human being. Like a good person. A real friend you can count one. This world sucks.\n\nAnyways Any tips on how I can improve my confidence? And like believe in myself?",

        "text": "I think most of us know our constant doomscolling is killing our motivation, happiness, and productivity.\n\nIt wastes time, but more importantly, constant dopamine hits make it impossible to focus on other tasks besides getting more dopamine - i.e., scrolling more on your phone.\n\nBecause of the biological impacts scrolling has on our brains, if you scroll social media or other apps for hours on end I have news for you: **it is probably the single biggest blocker to improving your life.**\n\nBut just knowing it's a problem isn't enough. If you‚Äôve tried to reduce your screen time then you know:¬†**it‚Äôs incredibly difficult.**¬†And it‚Äôs not entirely your fault. Social media companies use powerful psychological techniques to keep us engaged.\n\nLuckily for us, we can implement our own techniques and protocols to help fight back and reclaim our time and attention.\n\n# Below are the 7 most helpful tips I've implemented to help me stay off my phone:\n\n1. **Don‚Äôt sleep with your phone - delay use as late as possible.** Our addiction to dopamine largely resets overnight, meaning we have the most self-control when we wake up. Don‚Äôt immediately lose the day by scrolling on your phone.\n2. **Delete all social media/doomscrolling apps.** You don‚Äôt have to delete your accounts, but force yourself to use these apps on your computer (if at all). This makes using these apps more intentional.\n3. **Find a good screen time app.** App blockers never worked for me, that‚Äôs why I use ‚ÄúPresent: Screen Time Control‚Äù which motivates you to stay off your phone by turning it into a game, but there are countless others out there. Find one that works for you.\n4. **Increase distance between yourself and your phone whenever possible.** Leave your phone in another room, turn your phone off, etc. Anything you can do that increases the effort to access your phone will condition you to stop checking\n5. **Turn your phone to grayscale mode (black and white).** Apps intentionally use pretty colors to get us to look at them. If you turn everything to black and white, suddenly your phone becomes more boring. How to: Settings&gt;Accessibility&gt;Display &amp; Text&gt;Color Filters&gt;Grayscale\n6. **Turn off all non-human notifications.** Do you really need dozens of notifications from Domino‚Äôs letting you know that Hawaiian Pizza is trending in your area?? No! Make it a habit to turn off all these automated notifications that are designed to distract\n7. **Figure out what you want to do with all your extra time.** This one might be the most important. Tell yourself WHY you actually want to reduce your screen time and what you‚Äôre going to be able to accomplish. If you don‚Äôt tie reducing screen time to your goals then you‚Äôll fall right back into your old habits eventually\n\nThanks y‚Äôall, hope these help!",

She said I was mad at her. While it's true she said a couple of things that upset me, I didn't yell at her or anything, but she probably could see it on my face. Should I look for things in myself to change? Or should I stick with the boundary that I am allowed to respectfully express my feelings?\n\nAnother example is I was falsely accused of something I did not do.

I have so many friends back home but once i come to college it feels like i have no real friends. I am in a frat and somehow still have no social life.\n-quitting porn. I suspect this affects me subconsciously more than i think.\n-sleeping/eating healthy. I am constantly tired which makes it hard to make improvements on any of the things i listed above\n-exercising. I am really out of shape and it doesnt make me feel good.\n\nListing out all these things makes me realize how much i hate about myself. I feel so miserable and hopeless and it sucks.

        "text": "Before an answer about \"fear of failure\" or \"general helplessness\" shows up, I need to specify that I've read many pieces of advice and videos over my whole life now but I'm not improving. Please help me understand what I'm doing wrong and what I need to do.\n\nProcrastination has always been a problem for me throughout school and even out of college now. I hoped to have fixed this but it's not going anywhere and I think it's even worse now. I've read many pieces of advice and watched many videos. I have the capability to start off well and start getting some good habits, schedules, and plans but it's never been for good. Time after time, I show some improvement but I always end up spiraling back to sitting on my chair to consume unnecessary content and trivia for obscene hours, forgetting everything I've learned up to that point. I look for help again, then the process repeats. This has been a cycle for years.\n\nIt's only getting to extreme consequences with this writing project (won't specify) that I've been working on for more than a year. We've finally set a hard deadline, too many delays have happened no matter how many times I self-impose a work ethic or schedule. I just cannot get it done. I keep blanking out on the screen showing the words I've already wrote a week ago and even if I force myself to write just a little for a few minutes, my brain can't budge the motivation to keep going. There are a couple of trappings that should be obvious at first glance, but aren't the right answers for what's going on here:\n\n\\- I'm a perfectionist but it's not to an overly impeding degree. I know this because I don't care about the quality of this project anymore. I just want it to be done, mediocre or not. I'm tired of it and I want to move on to develop other work and hobbies. \n\n\\- I don't hate this project despite what I said, it's not a doomed prospect and I think it has the potential that my team will naturally fill in the blanks. I'm perfectly aware that I don't have to submit the greatest work ever.\n\n\\- I don't fear this project failing, it's not even a high risk if it does honestly. I just need it done.\n\n\\- I'm not out of ideas. I CONSTANTLY get ideas, write organized notes, and send myself details I think of on the fly during the day. I'm very easily inspired and creative... I just rarely EVER sit down to put them together.\n\n\\- I know that by finishing this and putting my time into it, I'll improve. I know that it isn't pointless to work on this and it is forwarding my career as a writer.\n\n\\- Despite the real pressures of deadlines and delays, my parents and team understand my mental block and procrastination problem. I've tested their patience many times but they fully support and sympathize with my issues, they are not the problem.\n\nDespite all this, I'm still paralyzed every time I open my document to work. No matter how many productivity apps, self-imposed bans, automatic site-blocking, and location-shifting practices I do my brain doesn't budge. Once I lose all of the options to distract myself, my brain always manages to find more. I'll get unnaturally sleepy, I'll start daydreaming about the things I can't do, I'll research for the project just to never write them on the page, and sometimes, after spending literal hours sitting down and doing nothing I eventually give in to just look at more random content because I wasn't doing anything else anyway.  \nThere are bursts of motivation where I actually do progress in my writing, and these are significant, but there is no formula. It's just utterly random. I want to say I'm trying hard to get into a better mindset and force myself to put down the ideas I already have, but I'm not and nothing I'm suggesting myself is working.\n\nI just can't work. And I don't know why.",

(Also as a note I rarely sleep more than 7.5 hrs regardless of when I go to bed and if I have an alarm set. I naturally just wake up after about 7hrs and always have). I go on social media a little (generally on breaks at work for 5ish minutes at a time and playing videos while cooking/cleaning) but I'm far from doom-scrolling. According to my phone I'm only on social media for a total maximum of 2 hours a day(again this is mostly while I'm cooking or at work so this time is included in my 11.5-12.5 hours I've accounted for).\nBasically there's 4-6hrs a day I'm just losing being too tired to do anything and yet not getting any more rest.

        "text": "I recently started working at a warehouse doing picking/packing. It's clear that I'm going to be fired in a few months because I can't keep up with everyone else, and they expect you to hustle all the time. Like I'll just go work fast food then because at least then I'd have a break when there isn't a line. I feel terrible about myself because of how incompetent I am at my job and how I'm not meeting their unrealistic expectations.\n\nI'm tired of typing my full life story. But the important bits are that I have had a series of jobs that I left due to depression and one recently because it was causing me panic attacks. I have a Bachelors degree and am a former ESL teacher who isn't interested in teaching.\n\nI live in a small city where there are limited job options. Not only this but it's hard to make friends here and there isn't much to do. The weather is cloudy/rainy 9 months out of the year and rent costs are rising despite the lack of jobs. Everyone here is punk, hip, into tattoos and piercings. Nothing wrong with this, but I don't fit this category at all. If I dress well, then I'm considered preppy. Like Seattle up north, where I live it is terminally casual, and I don't like that.\n\nHow is it possible for me to move somewhere else when I don't even have a full time job? I can't get a full time job. I have to get surgery for my hernia in a few weeks, and so I won't be able to work physical jobs for a while. Getting an 8-5 here is considered making it here, as far as I'm concerned. Everyone seems to be doing some kind of shift work or they're shooting up on the streets, and I'm not even exaggerating.\n\nI turned 31 recently and still live with my mom. It's embarrassing. Forget getting a girlfriend. I've never had a real gf, and living with one's parents at 31 is a huge turn off. I want to live on my own, but I can't afford it.\n\nI just want to move away, either to Seattle or another US city. But that takes money. And I'm working only part time. I hate having to endure living somewhere I hate just to finance moving somewhere else where I may end up hating. I literally have no one to talk to about this except my family and my therapist who doesn't give any advice.\n\nHow do I improve my situation?",

Im writing this from my phone while waiting for my son to get out of school.\nI am looking for advice.\nFirst im going to tell you about me to paint a picture \nI am 5 foot 5 and I'm at the heaviest I've ever been. I'm hovering around 275 but I kinda carry the weight well except for my mom pouch stomach.\nBefore I had children, I was in amazing shape even though I was considered overweight on the bmi scale, which while I do take into account, I do not follow blindly because I'm aware of its history and bias. I had my first child young, at 18. And while I gained a bit, I lost it all within the first few month. I strictly breast fed, only using bottles when necessary for all my children. With my second and third children, I gained, I was on bed rest and had horrible symptoms and was in and out of the hospital. I worked until I couldn't. I also went back to work as soon as my leave was up. I've always been physical, not as much anymore, but I dont just sit at home and watch TV. \nI work for instacart and doordash. So im walking and jogging and doing stairs alot. My legs are always in great shape, even if they are bigger, and I dont carry alot of fat there.\nI am also eating really healthy. I have been for 3 years almost. No dairy, cause it makes me feel bad, no gluten, for the same reason. I don't intake alot of processed sugars or eat the artifical kind either. I'm on a very strict AIP diet. And even limit the amount of meat I eat, going for mostly chicken when I need extra protein and fish because I love sea food. I also limit calorie intake and watch my portion sizes. I'm not starving myself or over eating. I enjoy fresh veggies and fruits. I drink flax meal water to help fill up 3 times a day and drink alot of water throughout the day by itself. No soda or energy drinks. Just unsweetened tea and black coffee when I want something different. \nI also play with my kids and do yoga and Tai chi with them every day. \nI dont gain anything if I'm not pregnant. I just can't seem to lose anything. I've even worked with specialists, Dr's, nutritionists, and personal trainers. I am not the strongest but I can lift quite a bit. \nAnd the belly fat is actually fat, not just loose skin.\nMy next step is to save money for surgery but I have to lose weight to qualify.\nI am married to a wonderful man who supports me in all that I'm doing and helps me when I'm feeling down about it, but never makes me feel bad about myself.\nNow for medical stuff. I am a walking medical mystery at the moment. I've gone in for test upon test and lots of blood work. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, arthritis, my back is messed up from the weight on my chest and belly, I also have a mass of scar tissue that causes me pain from the epidurals I've had. My l5 and pelvic bone is fused and  splitting apart, and I have a curvature that\" shouldn't be causing any pain\" according to the Dr, but pain is definitely there. I have a very weak neck that is in pain just from supporting my head all day every day. I have numerous problems from when a car hit me as a pedestrian and threw me 10 feet through the air, according to the police and camera footage. And from another accident involving my own stick shift ford truck slipping into gear from neutral and hit me 3 times trying to stop it. I've had several surgeries. I have chronic migraines and I am trying to get tested for POTS since I've been passing out when I stand for no reason and my heart rate sky rockets while my BP bottoms out. I also have been diagnosed with ptsd,depression, adhd, bipolar 2, bpd, and several other things. \nI'm currently only using Tylenol when needed as I've found other things help with pain and inflammation like coconut oil and turmeric in a paste on my joints.\nI do smoke weed to help everything else, but only at night after the kids are asleep. Other than that I take prenatal vitamins as an everyday vitamin.\nI've tried all diet plans and pills I can find. Nothing is working and i am loosing the battle in my head. I know I can feel so much better just loosing 75 to 80lbs but how do I do that when my body refuses to work with me?\nMy husband just started a new job and with our current income, as we just moved to a new state for safety reasons, I cannot afford surgery at this time. I haven't even had a wedding or honeymoon. I work all day every day and have my toddler with me while I work, then I come home to cook and clean and take care of the kids. I do all my exercises in the morning when we first wake up and my final bit before bed. I also do that intermittent fasting when I change it every once in a while based on my metabolism type.\n\nPlease help me. This is making my depression and anxiety worse. I just want to be healthy again",

        "text": "My hobby group moved 2.5 hours away from where I live 2 years ago. I still help out from a distance but want to be there in person with my friends. I'm finding it very challenging though. At the same time as the group moving, I became very isolated and agoraphobic. One of my goals this year is to start to overcome this, and I've done really well. I have managed to get to the point where I can leave the house with minimal anxiety, yesterday I got a part time job around my studies as a cleaner, which I'm really excited about, and I have joined a volunteering group where I have been able to realise that sure I'm awkward but I can do things and meet new people. I'm really proving to myself that I can do things and I am competent. I'm already at a stage where I never thought I'd get to. \n\nTo go back to my hobby group, being able to go back and spend the day with them is my year goal, but I seem to be stuck with this. Today I did what I thought was the impossible - I drove all the way to the same town my group moved to, had a sandwich in a park, and drove home. I didn't have a migraine and lose my vision, and I didn't have a single panic attack, even when the road was closed and I had to go back roads to get back on track. It is the longest I've ever driven (6 hours) and I am so proud of myself. This was a trial run for trying to go to my hobby group this Saturday. I found it quite tiring driving that much in one day, and I am worried that after spending the day with my hobby group which is quite physical, that I am going to really struggle with driving home on the same day. I don't have spare money (can barely afford food and petrol, so the idea of spending a night in a hotel (¬£50-150 for one or two nights)) is just too much at the moment. I really miss my friends and want to go, but the anxiety of spending the whole day and driving home after getting up at 5 to get there and then driving home late is really stressing me out. I want to go on Saturday but it just seems too challenging. It feels rude to only go for part of the day, and leave before the bit of the day where they need help. Does anyone have any advice or tips, as I'd really appreciate it?",

Today hasn't been the best day, especially this morning but writing everything down through out the day means I can look back now and see that, yes the first third of the day was pretty crap, however the other 2/3 was quite good. \n\nPreviously I would have just focused on the bad third and let it ruin the entire day but now it's much easier for me to also see the good parts of the day. And so far this has been true for every day since I started. Even the worst days have good moments and realizing this through the journal helped me to not sink into a hole of sadness because I'm convinced everything is just bad. It's not there is pretty much always SOMETHING good within a day.\n\nI wouldn't call this a tip, for that I'm too inexperienced with this. But it's a recommendation. Even if you think it won't work, just start with writing in your phones note app. Although I really like the feeling of an actual, physical journal :) If you go down that road I'd recommend taking some money and buying a nice one, not the cheapest one the dollar store has lying around.

        "text": "We had a slow break up\n\nIt started right after Christmas, he went into a depression and I was trying my hardest to help him.  I honestly feel guilty because I failed to ask at the beginning of our relationship for a timeline of his relationships.  When I finally found out, he had been alone a total of 3 or 4 months since divorce in the last 2.5 years.  And he‚Äôs 48.  He had never taken the time to heal himself from his childhood trauma (he grew up LDS, with a family that centered themselves around a disabled sibling) his marriage was dysfunctional as a function of the church, but when we met? He was honestly well adjusted.  He kept up with me.  \n\nAnd then after Christmas all of a sudden he thought he wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and became very passive aggressive looking for my attention.  Demanding all of my time (which he was nearly getting) and it spun me into manic. When I met with my therapist to break down what was happening I put in place some boundaries and reassured him exactly what I was doing with my time (I‚Äôm getting my second MBA- a program I put on pause because it was taking away from time with him) I had gotten a puppy for Christmas for my kids and surprisingly gotten two (last littermate came home too) so I was getting into a routine) I took on additional duties at work to honestly save my job, and my kids have always taken priority. \n\nHe asked for a few weeks to get his head space, and I gave him that and then we decided to date again, allow the relationship to grow again.  I listened intently and supported his plans to help himself, but voiced concerns when those plans included only Ayawaska or MDMA treatments, and when he said he was going to do ‚Äúhero‚Äù doses alone in his apartment or have his adult son supervise.  After I researched and couldn‚Äôt find evidence that pointed to clear conclusions that this would heal him, I asked him if he had that evidence I could look at and he didn‚Äôt.  I also said it was unfair to ask his adult child to supervise what could become a dangerous situation with no experience.  I offered books and resources, and became concerned that he wasn‚Äôt seeking them on his own (I ordered 3 books this morning on break ups) \n\nLast night we decided to do a small valentines at my house and when we sat down to dinner he said he didn‚Äôt get me anything for Valentine‚Äôs.  This is after he brought up the topic of gifts one week ago.  I said I‚Äôm not a huge Valentines person, I prefer small thoughtful gifts, that don‚Äôt cost much. For reference, I hand made a picture frame with a map of our first date on one side and our first picture on the other side. He didn‚Äôt bring a card.  He is a teacher and yesterday was a snow day, the snow had melted by 10am.  I don‚Äôt care about a gift, I care that it was clearly intentional.  \n\nMany of his actions have been passive aggressive, either in an attempt to get me to think of him, do something for him, feel bad for him.  I was madly in love.  I showed my love often and he told me so.  Unfortunately I think the unhealed parts of him, were afraid that I would change. The constant need for validation was not because of something I was doing but because of something he was missing internally. \n\nI think this will be hard to heal from. And I‚Äôm not sure why.  We spent many months blissfully happy.  And then it changed.  Sometimes it seems I‚Äôll never be able to trust that people have their shit together.  I‚Äôm beginning to believe maybe I will just be happier alone.  It is so hard to be in a relationship.  From a woman‚Äôs perspective it often feels like I‚Äôm taking care of another person, and I find it easier to just take care of me.",
