Einstein @ home is powered by volunteers who lend their spare computational capacity to the project, anybody with a computer can participate, no astrophysics PHD required. So far the project has processed over 50 billion individual candidates, which will be further analyzed by volunteers on their [zooniverse project](https://www.zooniverse.org/).\n\nPretty cool to think us regular people can contribute to such exciting discoveries from the comfort of our home. If you're interested in helping out, check out the Einstein @ home website linked below :).\n\nCheck out /r/BOINC4Science to learn more about this project and others on the BOINC network (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing)\n\nsource: [https://einsteinathome.org/content/news-about-einsteinhome-searches-radio-and-gamma-ray-pulsars](https://einsteinathome.org/content/news-about-einsteinhome-searches-radio-and-gamma-ray-pulsars)",

As black holes have the potential to absorb all matter including light , If and this is a big if all matter is absorbed into just one big black hole according to steven hawking idea that if a black hole dosent absorb enough matter after a long period of time it would begin to evaporate. This is know as hawking radiation. So let’s say all matter in our know universe was absorbed following the same principle that mega black hole would eventually evaporate. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed so in a sense all the energy that was in the black hole would be expelled form it (the big bang)\n\n\n-Dankayo",

Is it possible that technology is not a requirement to explore, expand, etc.?\n\nFor example, a planet-born mycelium discharges extremophile spores that are capable of surviving in space. \n\nProblems obviously would include: defeating the planet's gravity well, vast distances between planetary bodies, and suitable bodies in space for spores to develop. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are there potential scenarios you could envision that a non-advanced organism or species could become space-faring?",
