        "text": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy search algorithm and an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. PPO algorithm aims to optimize the expected reward of a given policy by adjusting the parameters of that policy in order to maximize its probability of success. This makes it easy to deploy in real-world applications since it does not rely on complicated off-policy techniques, but instead on simple updates to the policy. In addition, it has been shown to be highly sample efficient, making it a good choice for applications with limited data and resources. PPO also provides better exploration than most other reinforcement learning algorithms, which ensures rapid convergence of policies in complex environments. Finally, PPO is well-suited to continuous action spaces and has been used in robotics applications. In this post we will explore the PPO algorithm in detail and dive into the unknown! So join us learning PPO together and discover how this great reinforcement learning algorithm can help you reach the best performance possible. \n\n[https://deepboltzer.codes/proximal-policy-optimization](https://deepboltzer.codes/proximal-policy-optimization)\n\nHappy Learning!",

        "text": " Let us understand the core concepts underlying various¬†policy gradient algorithms! In simple terms, policy gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm which allows us to learn the optimal parameters of a given environment in order to maximize rewards.¬†As opposed to previously introduced methods - which suffered from the curse of dimensionality - it is not necessary to analyze the full action space to update the policy¬†œÄ. Instead of learning the parameters of a policy directly, the algorithm learns the gradient of expected rewards with respect to those parameters. The idea is that by taking small steps in the direction suggested by this gradient, we can converge on optimal policy parameters. So if you want to learn more about how policy gradient methods work, feel free to explore our latest blog post. We hope that this will help to get a better understanding of policy gradient methods! If you still have any questions or would like to discuss further, do not hesitate to reach out - we are always happy to help.\n\n[https://deepboltzer.codes/introduction-to-policy-gradients](https://deepboltzer.codes/introduction-to-policy-gradients)\n\nHappy learning!",

        "text": "Many German universities offer two CS degree programs, *Informatik* and *Medieninformatik*. *Informatik* is the standard German designation of CS and a translation to \"Computer Science\" on official documents is the usual way to do it, while *Medieninformatik* can be translated differently depending on the university's internal preference, I've seen \"Media Informatics\" (e.g. Aachen), \"Media Computer Science\" (e.g. Stuttgart), \"Computer Science for Digital Media\" (e.g. Weimar), \"Digital Media Technology\" (e.g. Berlin) and many other variants so far.\n\nIn any case, *Informatik* and *Medieninformatik* have very much the same study content. The main difference is that *Medieninformatik* usually has a few mandatory courses on HCI/CG/UX/VR related topics, while *Informatik* students can take some (but usually not all) of these courses as electives. Based on my industry experience, German employers usually don't discriminate these two subjects much (more or less similar to the case statistics vs. biostatistics).\n\nHowever, I wonder how people outside of the German-speaking countries, be it in academia or industry, would view the name \"**Media Informatics**\". Is it possible that they could confuse it with a degree in art, design, or even communications or journalism?",
