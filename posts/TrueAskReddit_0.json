If I know I will die young I wouldn't want to make someone I love fall in love with me and have to suffer going through that. I feel like it would be wrong of me, and I would want someone I love to be able to experience a relationship/marriage that isn't cut so short. I have mostly accepted this over the past couple years. I've fully accepted dying young and am living my life doing what I want and not being bothered by that fact, but part of me wishes I could be in a relationship. Every time I do start talking to a girl I feel a wave of guilt due to my circumstance and feeling it's selfish of me to force my situation on others, and to waste their time if I can't give them something for their whole life. I can't ask people im friends with on their opinion on this matter because I don't want people I know to know about my health concerns, and decided asking strangers for their thoughts would be the best idea.\n\nTldr: is starting a relationship when you are going to die young selfish?",

        "text": "\nHello, everyone.\n\nI'm relatively new to posting on Reddit and don't expect this to keep any of you up. However, I just heard the strangest noise ever.\n\nI live in a very small town in Northwestern Iowa, it has a population of about 1,500. I know the town like the back of my hand and can't seem to pinpoint the source of this bizarre noise.\n\nTo describe it, the noise came in sets of three, all identical to one another. They sounded quite lovely, a whistling tune that sounded very passive, and non-threatening.\n\nHowever, I heard it inside of my house, there is nobody here with me. Outside, it is cold as hell, and sounded far away, yet strangely loud.\n\nThe point is, I doubt it was one of my neighbors who made the noise.\nIn addition, I checked to see if I was playing any music because it's not too uncommon for me to mistake music for real life occurrences. To add onto that, I checked every electronic in my house; radios, televisions, record players, computers, etc; all of them were turned off.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I am the only one here, so asking if anyone else heard it would be unproductive, at best.\nI could go ask a neighbor, but it's almost 10:00 pm, it's very cold and eerily dark for this time of night.\n\nKeep in mind, I've also taken into accountability other probable factors. Instinctively, I thought it was the wind. However, I doubt the wind could whistle an identical tune three times in a row.\n\nI also thought it could be a car on the icy roads; yet again, it seems highly unlikely.\n\nI also thought it could be a bird, but it has yet to warm up for spring, and this area isn't known to have any unique birds that do anything other than chirp.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I keep trying to come to some logical explanation as to how a person could've made this noise, I've yet to find a theory that checks out, though.\n\nIt was just highly unexpected, it's a relatively quiet night, other than the occasional wind gusts, and it's just a typical Iowan night with nothing of interest going on around me.\n\nThe point is, it seems highly unlikely that any feasible external factors are at hand. I've taken everything to mind that I can think of, and it just doesn't check out.\n\nI'm open to suggestions, I'm just trying to figure this out. It's nothing that sent shivers down my spine, it's nothing that I'll lose sleep over, it would just be nice to know any suggestions.\n\nI don't expect this to gain much traction, so I will most likely post in other subreddits to get a firm grip on the subject at hand.\n\nSent with love, M.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/11lmscc/question_about_people_who_cant_have_a_serious/",
        "text": "Long read ahead but it's the only way I can get anyone to understand what I'm going through. \n\nSo, in my family, NO ONE can have a serious conversation about anything. However, I am able to, which is frustrating as hell!\n\nWhenever I bring up something that normal people would consider a serious conversation, the people in my family will either stonewall me, make jokes or get angry at me and turn things around like I am belittling them or something. And obviously the conversation goes nowhere.\n\nHere's a recent and relevant example:\nWe have a miniature horse named wilbur who is prone to stomach aches/getting colicky when they either have too many treats or eats some hay that has too much alfalfa in it. Which if you know horses, these ailments can be serious and deadly. Their stomachs can rupture and/or when they try to roll on the ground like they do when they're stomachs are not feeling well, they can twist their stomachs. And with money being tight these days, both of those outcomes would end up with us putting him down. My mom feeds him in the morning, I feed him at night and My step dad will get off of work inbetween those 2 times and go over to the farm and feed him snacks like apples sometimes. \n\nWell, 1 night ago I noticed he wasn't his usual self when I come out to feed him his normal hay and a handful of sweet feed. He usually Screams and snorts and comes rushing towards me. That night he didn't. So I knew that meant he probably had a belly ache. So I put his halter on and gave him some banamine which is medicine for horses with upset stomachs. I ran him around a little bit to try and work out the gas in his stomach/intestines. \n\nI go over to my mom and step dad's house to tell them that he's not feeling well and that even if he seems like he's feeling better the next day, we probably should stop feeding him any sweet feed or any treats like a piece of apple or anything like that for at least a couple days. My mom stonewalled me by looking down at her phone and scrolling the very minute she heard me mention any suggestions on what we should do with him. Then My step dad just smirked and started making idiotic jokes that only he thought were funny like \"well maybe it's not the sweet feed or treats. Maybe he ate a cat.\" like seriously STUPID jokes. I say \"no, I'm serious here. There's 3 things that could be making his belly upset. 1. Treats/sweet feed 2. The hay and 3. The least likely, the weather. So I think it's best we play it safe and eliminate the treats, which is for certain not to kill him if we do. Switch out the current hay bail with a more \"strawy\" bail and see if that helps. My mom is still scrolling on her phone not replying and my step dad is still making stupid jokes as if to imply that I have no clue what I'm talking about and my suggestions are idiotic. Finally I say \"I'm serious. Can we try that?\". Step-dad doesn't say anything and I have to nudge my mom to get a response. To which she replies angrily and sarcastically \"fine! We will try that!\"\n\nSo, today I come over around 2pm and ask my mom \"was he feeling better this morning?\" she replied \"yes\". Then I ask did you give him any sweet feed? And she replied \"yes\". I kept my frustration to myself and told myself \"don't say anything. I guess if he's feeling better, he'll be OK.\" then my step dad gets off of work and goes to the farm. When he gets back to my mom's house I ask him \"how was wilbur?\" he says \"fine.\" I asked him \"since I'm going to feed him in a bit, I need to know if you fed him any treats?\". He said \"yea. I fed him a half of an apple.\" once again, my frustration bubbled up inside but kept it to myself because maybe he'll be just fine.\n\nSo I go to feed him tonight and what do I see? He's laying on the ground in the mud and snow and won't move. For one, he rarely ever lays down and two if he does, it will be in his hay bed I make him under the roof near the barn. I also felt his belly and it felt like cement (not good!). So I call my mom and said \"he's not feeling good again. He's laying on the ground and won't move.\" she cruises over and the first thing I ask is \"can we have a serious conversation without you getting mad and no one making a joke about what I have to say?\" followed by \"I told you guys we shouldn't feed him Any treats for a few days until we know for sure he's feeling better. Why do you two just ignore my suggestions like they're dumb suggestions?\" she instantly gets pissed off and tries making excuses like she knows for sure it's not the sweet feed or the apple. And when I ask \"how do you know that?\" she gets even more upset.\n\nSo I stop her once more and say \"see, you're getting mad for no reason. Like I'm saying or doing something purposely to piss you off. And I'm not.\" followed by \"given that what wilbur is going through could possibly kill him. Is it not a reasonable suggestion to cut out treats and sweet feed until he's feeling better for a few days?\" then I said  \"if we don't know what it is exactly causing it, let's play process of elimination and cut out the sweet feed and treats, if he's still sick after that then it might be the hay which we will have to go and by a bail that we know doesn't have a lot of greens in it. If hes still sick after that then we know it's something else like the weather or possibly eating some plant he found or something. And regardless, if he has a belly ache, apples and sweet feed can't do anything but make it worse. So why do it???\"\n\nShe just looked at me like I was crazy and said angrily\" fine! We will try that!\" and I asked\" why are you saying that like youre mad at me?? I don't understand.\" to which she got in her car and said \"i'm leaving. Bye\" and drove off.\n\nSo I gave him more banamine tonight and now I'm staying over here to run him around every once in awhile to hopefully work out the bloat/gas out of him.\n\nThat's just one example of how serious conversations go in my family. And it's so frustrating. And honestly makes no sense to me. My suggestions i made about the horse would do nothing to hurt him. If anything, my suggestions would help him feel better and at the worst it would do nothing and we'd be at square one.\n\nI can only conclude that instead of them thinking about the horses health, they're more concerned with someone younger than them suggesting what they should do. And if what I say works that I'll lord it over them or something and use it in future situations with other things. That's all I can think of. Because the ONLY other reason would be they want the horse to die which I know that isn't it at all. Like, not at all. So it has to be my first conclusion.\n\nSorry for the long read. But I'm super frustrated right now. And this is just 1 example of MANY and the most recent. And never being able to have serious conversations with them without them either getting angry or shrugging off what I'm Saying with idiotic \"jokes\" it's extremely depressing and frustrating.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or articles or studies about this type of behavior, I'm all ears.

        "text": "I came across this video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vK4y6C1Uuhw\n\nWhich is about a study that was discussed a lot on Reddit in subs like this one:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1195kb7/us_most_young_men_are_single_most_young_women_are/\n\nBut the general concept is one that comes up a lot on subreddits that discuss things closely. If you're on a subreddit like this one, you've seen this topic, \"how men are falling behind\". However, I've found a lot of the discussion lacking in specifics and potential fixes. I'd be interested to hear some well formulated thoughts, as I think there's some interesting angles to this that don't get discussed too often.\n\nFor full disclosure, I consider myself a well adjusted man. I'm in my early 30s, earn over six figures, go to the gym a few times a week, have no debt except a mortgage on my house, a quite good retirement account, and I've had multiple multi-year relationships and a healthy social and sex life. I am married and have my first child now and I think I'm a good dad. I am quite left-wing in my political outlook, particularly economically. I grew up in a blue collar, immigrant, fairly \"traditional\" family.\n\n* Is there any serious solution to the economic angle?\n\nIn a lot of the discussion, like in the CNN clip, the expert says something about how average wages have remained stagnant and declined since the 70s. About how everything is more expensive and it disincentivizes family creation. I agree with this angle and [wrote a pretty well received post on it recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11aq45o/japan_readies_last_hope_measures_to_stop_falling/j9tqz0x/). What I'm most curious is, is there any serious remedy to this?\n\nTo me this outcome is very predictable for a deregulated capitalist economy. The race to the bottom means that wages go down and work time goes up. Any attempt to change that means very explicitly butting up against the concept of a free market. For the record I am very much for this, but I think the majority of voters are not. Certainly not the moderate liberals like on that CNN panel. They aptly describe the problem, and then come across that uncomfortable point where you can't go further without acknowledging contradictions between capitalism and a good family life, so they just kind of shrug and move on.\n\nMy personal conclusion is that there is no realistic path to solve this issue economically. It is outside of the US Overton Window in coverage and electability. I will always vote for the furthest left candidate, but for the near future, this is the economy we have and we will continue to have.\n\n* Why specifically can't men adapt to the new economy? Are we not giving men enough credit?\n\nA lot of the discussion talks about how schools are weighted towards how women learn and they discourage men. I have to confess that I don't have much first hand experience. I was always gifted intellectually, got very good grades, advanced, classes, and have a Masters in Engineering. To me, reading a book quietly and taking tests and learning new software and doing class projects always came naturally. I don't quite understand what people mean when they say this.\n\nOf course, I understand that historically, men were over-represented as scientists, entrepreneurs, innovators and the field that we associate with success. I guess I had a bias towards thinking that the academic fields and intellectual \"thinker\" type success was a man's field. I don't intuitively \"get' how we've structured things so that now it's flipped.\n\nOr has it always been a minority of men with the intellectual aptitude to do these things, and the vast majority of men are \"button pushers\" for lack of a better term? And when manufacturing and blue collar work left the US, they literally have no market value? That doesn't sit right with me either, because it assumes very little of men. Is there this gigantic swath of them who just don't have the ability to do intellectual thing? Or work through the school system to the point where they get a degree that will get them a job with what is in demand? My gut tells me that's not right.\n\n* Is the focus on women really harming men?\n\nOne argument that comes up a lot is that a lot of the focus on empowering women or minorities comes at the cost of making white men the bad guys. I have to admit, I can't validate that with my personal experience as a white man. Of course, most of the special episodes on TV and guests coming into the classroom and focus was on empowering girls and minorities. But I never felt discouraged as a white man. Even if you told me I was dumb fucking cracker asshole who couldn't do shit, I'd still read books and tinker with technology because I just liked doing those things. I don't quite understand this argument, that helping those people came at a cost to people like me.\n\n* What do you do with people you know in this position?\n\nNow that I'm in my 30s, I have some friends and acquaintances for whom I can see are \"failures to launch\". Their work history doesn't resemble a career and is mostly low wage work here and there, entry level supermarket work and things like that. They live with their parent and have no realistic chance of ever moving out, much less owning property they purchase themselves. They drool over Instagram and OnlyFans models and compulsively masturbate. They don't take care of their health, either with food choice or exercise. They are overly focused on consumer pleasure - the latest Pokemon game, Fortnite skins, that kind of thing. Their plan for life as it is hops between coding bootcamps they never finish, crypto schemes, buying into Gary V or one of those hustle people's pyramid schemes, sports betting with the latest explosion of apps, dropshipping, something with AI. There's always an angle or scheme that seems to drop off into another one sooner or later. They have not dated anyone as long as I have known them and don't seem to have the social awareness as to why. Like they don't take social cues to have a conversation, they can't project confidence or romance. Their hygiene is poor. They usually fall into some right wing guru like Andrew Tate.\n\nThere's nothing wrong or illegal about living like this if you're happy. But when they are obviously not happy, it's genuinely sad to see. Do you know people like this? Are these \"button pushers\" who due to de-industrialization in the US have lost their buttons to push? Is there just a subset of men who need to have something like that or else they kind of aimlessly drift through life like this? Genuine question, I don't know.\n\n* Is there a toughness or resilience argument?\n\nHere's where I may seem a bit conservative or old school. But as in the previous section, when I see my friend like that I go back and think \"what did I do different? How come I didn't end up like that?\" Me and those groups of people all grew up as friends. I was a big video gamer as well. I was a cringey Linkin Park and Slipknot fan also (no shade though, I still think the music is good). I was awkward on AIM with flirting with girls too in the beginning. I wasn't some popular kid going to all the school dances either. I spent hours editing video game level mods or reading nerdy anime shit also. How can you tell if someone is going down that path, or more importantly, how can you change it?\n\nMy personal pet theory when I think about myself is that I was put into uncomfortable situations in which I had to grow. I think the psychological term nowadays is \"resilience\". Like I said I grew up in a very blue collar immigrant family. I'd have Saturdays where my dad would unplug my video games as I was playing them and say \"get the hell outside, we need to dig a trench\". Or fix a pipe or cut a tree down or whatever it might be. I used to work with uncles and cousins in various trades being a helper before I was in college. I would go fishing with \"bro-ey\" kind of people, that kind of thing. Usually against my will, as I was a pretty nerdy kid. \n\nBut when I think back, I think that really helped me navigate the world. I was put in positions with people who didn't have the same background as me. Usually guys who were crass or overly masculine. And I learned how to deal with it. I learned how to shoot back when someone was teasing me and eventually laugh together at the end of the day. I learned how to take elements of traditional masculinity without the toxicity and stand up straight and have confidence. I learned that sometimes life is unfair and you get accused of doing something you didn't do, or you get left with an impossible situation and you need to live through it.\n\nAnd I attribute those kinds of lessons to being able to navigate into a field where I had literally no network to get into. To get past the gauntlets of switching jobs and getting your resume through an algorithm and how to adjust to a new job and excel and get promoted. How to confidently and respectfully approach a woman and be pleasant and up front with your intentions. How to say \"Screw it, I'm going to start a business and I'm going to make these people want to give me money for my service\". How to deal with going through bureaucracy and advocating for myself.\n\nWhen I think of how I'm different from a stereotypical \"failure to launch\" guy, I do see myself in them. Sometimes I do think that the only difference in how my personality grew to help me navigate the world better was because I was put in unfair, uncomfortable, sink or swim types of situations. And those friends I have that didn't get put into situations like that seem a bit less...*resilient* in a way that I think affects their lives such that it leads to them being a statistic in \"Why men are falling behind\".\n\nMy pet theory is that our culture discourages putting kids or boys in situations like this, because it just inherently seems wrong. There's a whole train of thought about how kids are coddled and are soft. Like I said, this is the one place in which I am a bit \"old school\" where I think maybe it is good for an adolescent to have to think on their feet and be put in an unfair situation. Or have a little more responsibility placed on them than they were expecting. Not in any of those \"abusive upbringing\" kind of ways, obviously. But in ways that are within the bounds of suburban modern day life. I think a little struggle like that can make the eventual man more resilient and able to adapt to the modern world.\n\nAnyway, those are just my pet theories. I'm curious at what other people think.",

        "text": "I've already posted this somewhere else but I'm searching for answers so here I am.\nI am not seeking professional help nor do I expect it here, I am far more interested in what average, normal unbiased and strangers thoughts are on what you're about to read. That is my only intent here, nothing more and nothing less.\nIf this post is not ok I understand and apologize but the rules I've seen here seem to fit this... Situation?? That happens to be my present. \nIm a (22M) kissless virgin.\nI'm not the typical \"niceguy\" neckbeard type but I'm also not a extroverted Chad TYPE A individual. I'm the middle ground, I'm not unfortunate looking but im not a gem either. Im a bit \"quite a bit\" different to other humans. I don't understand human behavior, I try to blend in with the masses so I can be entertained by mostly normal humans. I find them interesting, what normal interactions look like. I only have male friends, they know I'm a virgin and try to push me. Like female genitalia is all that matters in life. I know that my first time if it comes WILL NOT be extravagant, but I don't want to lose it to a woman who I can't see being a part of my life. The problem with that is I have no idea how to develop a connection or why I my brain thinks it needs a connection emotionally or mentally or however it works and I don't understand it, I don't even have a connection with my own friends or family, even my mother. I just like hanging out with them because they're funny and we can crack jokes together but that's all I feel and get from those interactions. I care about them but only in the way that I'd be sad if something happened to them and I can barely express sympathy but I try so they at least think I have a heart. I can feel that I want to share my bed with a woman to cuddle with and hold at night but I don't even understand why I feel this almost weight inside me. It's like a primal barbaric instinct that made its way to my damn near reptillian, analytic observational type of brain. \n\nTo be honest I think I'm too far gone and too different for any woman's senses to not pick up on the fact that I'm not right in the head and I'm aware of it.\n\nI'm not a threat to society, I am stable and am the happiest I've even been in my life \"shitty childhood and teenage years\" those sob stories seem to be far too common though.\n\nI am not abusive physically, mentally or emotionally and I believe I'm incapable of hurting people unless I need to defend myself of course. That seems so unnecessary and cave man like. I grew up with all three of those forms of abuse, every day that was my life and if I were to ever have children I would make sure they receive nothing but my idea of what love and nurturing looks like from a father's role. The innocence is a beautiful thing and it is priceless to me, the open mind and creativity of a child is a experience to behold and protect as long as possible. Even though I also believe that organic life is pointless. I have a need to believe that this life serves at least the most microscopic amount of purpose, the idea of me having children and giving them an enjoyable, loving, caring and supportive childhood and teenage years as well as having a woman that understands my brains workings is a spectacular thought. A purpose for my past suffering, a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe even joy. \n\nBut women don't know this about me, they can tell that I'm off and I try to put myself in a females position. They are far more vulnerable and not as able to defend themselves from potential predators. I completely understand as well as respect their situation and quickly oblige their uncomfortable appearing body language or words by making myself scarce as politely as I can even though they're incorrect about me.\nI don't like the idea of people being uncomfortable or afraid of me which is why I never talk to anyone about this and also why I try to blend in as best as I can copy what I observe from normal humans.\n\nTyping this out and reading it would sound scary to another person but this is my truth. I will never tell anyone unless i know for a fact they can handle it. Only you reddit, You are the only entity who wouldn't have cut me off during me letting you have a peek into my mind and put me in a institution. \n\nIs there anyone else like me? Maybe a woman?\nSimply knowing that I'm not alone would make me... Hopeful I think?",

        "text": "So I'll start by saying me and my husband have been together for 10 years. We were young when we married. Me 30f him 31m. We have 3 beautiful babies. Just for back story we've been through alot. Lost a kid right after birth, loss of family, many traumatic things and he's always been my rock we have been a great team. Just trying to make it clear why it's hard for me to walk away. About 3 years ago we found out our daughter was hurt by a family member on my husband's side and we pressed charges and cut them off but I could tell this deeply hurt my husband but he stood beside us and was supportive, but this is about the time our real issues started. He was always out with friends, constantly had people over. I tolerated it at first but after over a year it got old and I realized there was no end in sight and it was ripping us apart. We had absolutely NO PERSONAL TIME. When we did he was just wanting sex, i felt like a toy. I decided to lay down the law that this could only be a sometime thing with his friends that i was lonely, exhausted,  and honestly just wanted my husband back.  I've never been a overbearing wife he can go where he wants no questions asked and as long as he gave me a heads up I NEVER SAID NO TO HIS FRIENDS BEING AROUND but we literally couldn't even go on a date without him wanting to invite a friend at some point. Anyways after awhile of these conversations I had someone from high-school reach out to me. I was lonely and venerable no excuse but It started off friendly \"hey beautiful\" small talk and then became a friendship which \"eventually\" got super flirty. He eventually took a shot and sent me a picture of his... you know and I really don't know what came over me but I sent a underwear picture back. We then started getting a little to comfortable talking all day and my husband shortly later saw my phone and freaked out and threatened to leave. I lied and said he was a friend because he didnt see the pictures just friendly conversation but I immediately broke off the conversation seeing the hurt in my partner, and never looked back. I never wanted or intended to hurt him. Even though I did. Fast forward a year I started getting weird vibes from my husband he was leaving early for work. Going to the gym 24/7, sketchy with his phone but I told myself \"I know my husband\" he would a NEVER hurt me and he's always been a bad liar cause we are best friends I would know right!?! Well I was wrong! Last year a lady confronted me at his Christmas work party insinuated lightly something was going on and left it at that. I confronted my husband with nothing but a hunch and this random woman's word with no detail and he bodly denied it. Said she had made passes at him in the past and was probably jealous. I again was stupid and just took him at his word. This year rolls around and again at his work Christmas part she said something again to the extent of \"how do you tolerate his behavior that would break my heart\" but gave me no details or anything I confronted him again and same story. Well I kept it in my back pocket this time and checked his phone several times before one day doing a deep dive and looking through all his apps, pictures, and trash in his phone and what do you know he had a conversation ans pictures of this lady from work saying he loved her and he would always care about her but they had to stop talking. When I confronted him he took a Minute but then he told me everything. That he had seen this woman on and off for about 2 years that they had sex a hand full of times and grew a strong friendship. They obviously as I said told eachother they loved eachother as well but as soon as I told him to cut it off and make it clear and block her he did. As well as gave me access to everything. Phone records, passwords, Even took it apon his self to download a GPS, and got using counseling right away. I've been happy with his changes and I believe I know his heart and this doesn't change who I know he is. We also opened up communication and i told him honestly who the other man was and that i did indeed send him pictures and he said he forgave me and \"couldnt be mad with what he did\". Fast forward to today and we  started counseling. our therapist was telling us both this would take time. For him to answer all my questions honestly yatta yatta and for some reason this set him off and he completely through me under the bus without warning me he was going to bring it up. No conversation about him being upset or anything and started telling our therapist that \"I get to grill him all day\" but he can't even ask questions and that he still thinks I'm lying even though he never told me that and I opened up to him willingly. He even told the therapist I was trying to use his cheating as a free pass to sweep what I did under the rug.. even though I told him I was telling him so we could start on a fresh slate no secrets no lies. But he insinuated I was STILL hiding things even though he goes through my phone all the time and since the event I leave it out where he can. I know this is long winded but I feel like this sent me right back to square one. I'm feeling like he is a enemy. Like he used my honesty as a tool to victimize himself. Like he kind of gaslite me and our therapist to take some of the guilt off of himself and to not talk about what he did, and like he is undermining the whole situation. I never slept with this man never saw him in person, I never chose him over our family, and I know I should have never done it but it didn't last long and as soon as reality hit me where it was going and what I was risking I ended it. He did his dirt FOR YEARS gaslite me into believing I was crazy, was texting and calling her while not responding to me, telling this woman he loved her and slept with her. I havent even told anyone whats going on to protect him. I'm just so confused and i don't know if it's still worth fighting for. Obviously I'm gonna sound like a lunatic at this point but should I even try to make this work. He's been the best friend I've ever had until all this. We rarely fight.. I'm just so lost how we got here and if we could even build again after all the hurt. I thought we could until I saw that side of him tonight and now I'm just feeling like maybe i don't know him as well as I thought I did and maybe he's not willing to protect me the way I am him. Maybe we both just f@#$Ed up to bad. Help I have no one to talk to.",

        "text": "I posted this in another sub, but I wanted to get more opinions. There are two specific examples that always lead me to this question. To give a very simplistic generalization as my first example, poor people are often depicted as happier than wealthier people because their lives are much more community and relationship oriented, because any sources of any negative feelings they may have are often caused by tangible problems (like having enough to eat, having a place to live, and so on) rather than more abstract life problems, and because they tend to be more \"needed\" by other people, but then they're simultaneously depicted as too busy surviving in order to even consider happiness. Are \"poor people\" generally happier than people who are \"not poor\", or are the poor people too busy surviving to know that they’re unhappy? It has been said that constantly having to work to stay alive gives them a purpose and leaves them less time to suffer from existential crises or negative attitudes towards life. Aren't existential crises a necessary part of \"developing yourself\" as a person and growing to become more content? Is \"self development\" of this kind even necessary to be content? Do you always need something in your life to “fight against” (like poverty or illness or injustice some other inhibiting or even dangerous life circumstance) in order to appreciate your life and be content?\n\nAs for the second example, we often hear about young kids who laugh about everything and exist largely in the present moment, even though they have no actual control over their lives or even their sense of selves to really “understand” what the meaning of contentedness even is. A child is often happy to play outside all day every day no matter what is going on around them, and children generally have no wisdom, no life experience, and no real concept of love, compassion, or empathy outside of a childlike \"narcissistic\" version of these things. They don't generally have a \"passion in life\" or any big goals that they are truly driven to aim for. Despite this, children are generally depicted as happier than adults. Does the fact that children live in a tiny, supervised world and don’t have very many options to choose from in their day to day life actually improve their outlook on life and their contentedness?",

        "text": "Now imagine:\nYou have since the 8 grade (second half of the year) a crush on a girl. Now over a year. At the beginning you thought it won't last long, because you often had a crush on girls for about a week. So the first week passes and still same crush. Second week passes and still the same. After a month you think: yea i love her definitely. The in french class the teacher said sit beside her because you were talking to much with your best friend(Let's call him Justin). Perfect opportunity. So first lesson wasn't very good. Now you think nothing about it. Second lesson she was asking \"do you speak Russian?\" and my response was yes. We talked for the next 2-3 lessons. After a bit of time she just didn't began a conversation with me and me having no confidence so. The teacher was also very angry about me because I didn't do anything so like some month later I was sitting at another place. And sadly someone else (a boy) was sitting beside her. My other best friend (Let's call him David) at that time was talking with me about her and this guy also talked with her, did things for school with her but I think they never met each other. Before I was turning 14 i quitted our friendship because I didn't liked David any more, that with my crush and he was strange at all. At this time I interacted not much with my crush. June Summer Break came and I didn't really thought about her. Maybe quite a bit but it wasn't annoying. After that I was very happy that she was in every lesson, every course we had sitting around girls. In the autumn holidays I had a call with an other best friend (Let's call him Finn) I had the idea that maybe I should send her a text message or something. After 6 hours waiting my crush read it and didn't responded. And still not. Now going further in french class my teacher was angry about my crush and her best friend talking all the time. He decided putting my, she \"hated\" friend (Let's call him Andrew) next to her.(Short story, he also had a crush on her, messaged her per sms and she rejected him) Andrew managed that she joined our clan in clash royale. I thought it is like a prank so I said write me a message on WhatsApp if you are real. But she didn't had my number and because there are also some random dudes on the clan I firstly said go on our class chat. And nothing. I said then here is my insta. And suddenly I've got a message WTF from a new account and also she got a profile pic from her TikTok ACC. So our \"Chat streak\" ended very fast. At this time we got a new seating arrangement. She sat next to the guy every girl loved and I think she too. So me having no confidence and no friend was sitting near me I had it even worse. And ot gets worse. On 27.12.2022 I logged in Instagram and got many messages from her saying that I should invite he back to our clan in clash royale. I gave her the data to the clan and yeah. We talked a bit and why she didn't wants to talk to me on WhatsApp. At the beginning it was \"cringe\" but then it turned out she didn't wanted to, because her friends and her mom are looking in to her privat chats, but on Instagram not. We talked every day at that point. But she began to talk about Andrew. She say he is actually ok and quite nice. The she said she has a crush on him. She told to ask him if she also had feelings for her. But after Andrew got rejected in 7th grade he hated her. After that \"incident\" talked futher. After time she talked less to me on Instagram. Sadly I made many mistakes and blunders(Chess players know what I mean) and our streak of having shitty conversations ended. I was a bit sad and also Finn had a crush on her who said \"I don't have a crush anymore on her\"(he fell in love with her when I did and said that after about a year) talked about her and my brain \"drove\" me in a very bad or depressed phase. But I think it isn't a depression. Just a bad phase as I many times got especially during the time I had/have a crush on her. Finn talked very much about her and Andrew too but in a mean way. In the last weeks not much happened but over the weekend I got sick and now it gets even badder. 13.2.2023 I had a call with Justin because my parents forced me to get homeworks and also to get the information what i  school happened. My friend said to me \"Finn said I should better not tell you but a teacher came in and got her out because what she did with some on the toilet.\" Justin talked with me for the rest of the hour we talked about normal things. After the call it began to hurt, \"Why? Who? Maybe I should forget her? Was that a prank?\" I thought maybe I jerk off, feel good and yeah, but no the s**reminded me even more of her. My dick also didn't got hard. Then I should watching some TikTok and forget this stuff. And now i decided to write it down. Maybe someone could help or idk. \n\nSo the question is:\n1. What happened there(on the toilet)?\n2. Was it a fake acc or real acc on insta/cr?\n2.1 If it was real the WTF does she thinks???\n2.2 If it's fake who TF do that shit???\n3. I should definitely forget her, shouldn't I?\n4. WTF am I going to do?\n5. If I made some writing mistakes, tell me.\n\nNow I want to thank you for reading such a crazy story and for your help. It was a bit a relief and now I'm going to overthinking while I'm trying to distract me with stupid Southpark clips on TikTok.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/111gqs1/what_are_the_best_rebuttals_to_these_common/",
        "text": "Inevitably in any conversation concerning human behavior, nature or wrongdoing someone will always try to explain why people are the way they are or why they perform certain actions and in response someone always responds with one of two arguments. They either say the suggested reason for someone’s wrongdoing is “no excuse” for it or the classic “I was/am XYZ and I never/don’t do [insert immoral behavior or action].”\nMy question is since these two rebuttals get used regularly what would be the best refutation in your opinion and are the two refutations offered below reasonable?\nMy refutation for the “That’s no excuse” response is to say it (whatever it may be) isn’t an excuse for wrongdoing but it is a reason. Whether or not you believe in free will and what kind it’s obvious people do things for reasons even if those reasons aren’t explicitly known to themselves at the time. Someone who did the most random things for no discernible reason at a moment’s notice would be an extremely mentally ill person that couldn’t function in society. Saying that someone for example stole money because they were poor or attacked someone else because they were angry doesn’t excuse their behavior or make it okay. It’s simply a matter of fact explanation that doesn’t necessarily carry any kind of exculpatory power. A reason you don’t like doesn’t magically stop being a reason.\nMy refutation for the second argument would be more nuanced in that although for example most people who live in poverty don’t commit crime the state of systemic poverty itself is naturally and logically conducive to behaviors and actions we disapprove of which includes crime. If you give 100 average people a choice between right and wrong inevitably some number of them will choose to do the wrong thing for one reason or another. Humans aren’t perfect angels and even people who are good and upstanding citizens aren’t necessarily like that every moment of their life. Temptation and weakness are very powerful forces whether it’s mundane like failing a diet or serious like committing a crime or betraying someone. It doesn’t necessarily make the ones that choose to do the wrong thing intrinsically evil, psychopaths, monsters etc.\nThe number of people who choose to do wrong in any hypothetical scenario only increases if they’re in a suboptimal situation or environment that leads some people to do wrong or break the law for some kind of gain whether financial or otherwise. To use the poverty analogy people living in poverty and horrible environments tend to commit far more street crimes than people who live in gated communities and suburbs and frankly it would be bizarre from a sociological perspective if this wasn’t the case. People aren’t perfect robots that are identical to each other in every single way after all. As mentioned in the previous paragraph this isn’t an attempt to say it’s okay to do bad things in certain circumstances but an attempt to explain why people do the things they do and how their environments influence their decisions. Humans aren’t perfect by any means and as Chomsky once said our DNA is closer to apes than angels. If people were perfect and made perfect decisions no matter what we would be living in a utopia, not the kind of world we live in now.",
