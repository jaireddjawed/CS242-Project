Maybe someone finds this useful. I find that sometimes people don't really write up what precisely they did, so therefore I have included snapshots of my exact programs (well more or less) to show what I trained and how, and how everything progressed. \n\n**Background**:\n\n* 34 year old male\n\n* 112-113kg bodyweight, average bodyfat %age. Not lean, but no real belly either. \n\n* 189 cm tall, 201 cm armspan with a relatively short back to long legs and arms. I.e I'm a natural puller, but not a squatter or presser. \n\n* Work an office job, no kids or other commitments. I.e not that much physical stress or work outside of my training. \n\n* Previously competed in Olympic weightlfting, past year or so have been focusing on throwing shot, discus and hammer. Therefore the training here is geared towards assisting that. \n\n* Have been lifting for some 14-15 years, started when I was 19. Have done Olympic weightlifting since 2011, and have competed on and off in weightlifting in that time. Until around late 2018 did my own programming that was relatively haphazard, but made progress as I was very consistent in my training. Late 2018 to the middle of 2022 trained on the programs of a weightlifting coach that improved my technique, but didn't do that much for my absolute strength levels. I'm still training with this coach, but starting to do my own programming again, but now with more thinking and science behind what I'm doing. \n\n* My previous program was a modified version of Juggernaut which can be read about here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/yrigfk\/maybe_its_not_about_the_1rm_at_the_end_but_rather\/ \n\nMy aim was to do a nice proper training block, starting off with some higher volume, almost work capacity training, and then moving through a strength block with a peak. Goal was to improve my squat, bench, and Olympic lifts\/their variations. Didn't focus much on a heavy deadlift. \n\nI've really enjoyed Alex Bromley's content on programming, and it has heavily influenced me, which is why what I did was based on his programming templates. Also some influence from the work of Vesteinn Hafsteinsson, one of the best throwing (and therefore also strength) coaches working today: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UlLTFSMcVJo\n\n**For my volume block**, I took as my starting point Bromley's block periodization program from LiftVault (https:\/\/liftvault.com\/programs\/powerlifting\/block-periodization-powerlifting-program-empire-barbell\/), and specifically the 6 week volume phase from it. I did make some adjustments to it, and this is pretty much the full program as I ran it:\n[Volume-block.png](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/64W4JVG9)\n\n* As originally written, that program had too much volume. I think I'd have the energy for it (just about) but not the time, so my program was a bit more skinned down. I progressed both my back squat and my bench press with 3x10\/4x10\/5x10\/5x8\/6x8\/AMRAP from week to week. My secondary lift for each movement, done on a different day, was the front squat and incline bench. Incilne bench progressed with pretty much the same set\/rep scheme, front squat I dropped reps to 3x8\/4x8\/5x8\/5x6\/6x6\/6x6. I let increasing volume be the overload driver, with some increases in weight as well from week to week. I also had 2 days where I worked on Olympic lifts or their variations. \n\n* One thing that I felt was missing when I ran Juggernaut was that being away from heavier weights for a long time makes you fall out of touch with them, so I worked up to an overwarm heavy bench or back squat on my secondary day, just so that I don't lose the feel. Nothing heavy, not pushing anything, just getting a bit of touch points in and then hammering the volume. \n\n* Some programs have you reduce volume as you increase weight, but I liked this double progression of adding more sets while simultaneously adding a bit of weight as well. It just can't be 5x5 or 5x3 all the time, I do think one needs some periods of a bit higher volume as well. After I finished the volume block, did a half week or so deload (basically completely off training as it coincided with new year's eve). Accessory work was relatively bodybuilding-esque, using some leg press\/hamstring curls for the lower body, triceps work and occasional rear delt\/chest work for the upper body, plus of course upper back rows\/pull ups. \n\n**For the strength block**, I used Alex Bromley's Bullmastiff as a starting point: https:\/\/www.boostcamp.app\/alex-bromley\/bullmastiff\n\n* This here is exactly what I did, the full 9 week block prior to max testing. \n[Strength-block.png](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hjdyymvf)\n\n* What I modified was that I added in working up to a heavy double or single in the back squat, bench press (which I now did all paused reps, while as the volume block had been touch and go reps), front squat (paused) and close grip bench (paused). Basically the setup was that I'd hit my heavy double or single for the day, and then do the Bullmastiff-esque prescribed volume\/strength work as back-off sets. You can see in the program, but I stated from around 80-85% in week 1 for my heavy single or double, and the progressed that ultimately to near 100% of my old max by week 9 before deloading and then testing my max. \n\n* The volume work was 4x6\/4x5\/4x4 (each for a 3 week block, before moving on to the next rep range) which I did for both bench press and back squat. Front squat I did 3x6 progressing down to 2x3 as my back off work (as the weights increased), close grip bench was 3x10 at the start of week 1, moving down to 2x5 by week 9. I had two Olympic lifting days, one where I progressed a variation and one where I did a full lift. My only heavy pulling was snatch grip deadlifts which I used a simple 3x6 in week 1 progressing up to 2x5 by week 8 setup. I wasn't really that focused on heavy pulling this block. \n\n* Accessory work was some triceps work, single leg work (doing leg press for a bit, and then front foot elevated split squats), and trying to push the weight on belt squats.  \n\nMy typical training week was this, across both the volume and strength phase:\n\n* Monday: Back squat and lower body accessory\n\n* Tuesday: Bench press and upper body accessory\n\n* Wednesday: Olympic lift variations + deadlift variation \n\n* Thursday: throwing practice\n\n* Friday: secondary squat and secondary bench movement\n\n* Saturday: Low volume full Olympic lifts, throwing practice\n\n* Sunday: rest\n\nWhat constrains me in how I set things up is that my weightlifting gym which is equipped with absolutely everything a strength athlete would want is 35-40 mins from my home (and there isn't really a proper strength gym closer to me) so I go there sparingly twice a week. Otherwise I train at the gym in my apartment complex (2 mins from my door), which has a squat rack, bench, dumbbells and machines, but no lifting platform and the ceiling is too low to do overhead work. But life is all about compromises and tradeoffs. \n\n**The results:**\n\nHere I need to preface this with understanding what your starting point is. I was beating myself up for not hitting all time maxes that I may have done when I was 7 years younger, but that's not the baseline I was starting off from. I tried to see what was the improvement relative to when I began the program, and whether I hit a weight that was the heaviest I'd done in x-number of years. \n\nLift | Start of program | End of program\n:--|:--|:--\nBench press | 1x130kg touch and go | 130kg with a pause (heaviest paused rep I'd done in over 3 years) and 135kg touch and go. When I was testing this I felt like I had a lot more in me as 135kg moved well, but on 140kg I felt a twinge in my pec as I was lowering the weight and just had my spotter pull the weight off me without attempting it. Doesn't seem like its a serious injury, but really annoyed by that. Also hit 110kgx1 and 15x70kg on the incline bench and 2x115kg paused CGBP which were PBs, but more due to never really having tried to max these out rather than massive strength improvements. \nBack squat | 1x175kg | 180kg, which is the most I've squatted in some 3 years, and a weight I've only ever done once before. Also hit a nice rep max at 13x140kg. Given that this implies a 1RM of near 200kg, I'm definitely better at rep work than maximal work. \nFront squat | Hadn't really gone heavy on this for a while, so hard to say | 1x150kg bounced, 1x145kg paused. Heaviest paused I'd done in years, best bounced front squat in a year.\nOlympic lifts | Hadn't really pushed these much right before I started the program | All time best above the knee hang snatch of 105kg, 141kg clean (heaviest I'd done in 9 years), 90kg power snatch and 120kg power clean (all time best lifts), 122kg push press from the front (best in c3-4 years). Also did a 210kg snatch grip deadlift, best I've done in c2 years. \n\n**Conclusion**: \n\nReally enjoyed this kind of programming. While I might not have hit all time bests in everything (though in the Olympic lifts I did hit a few of those), these were nice little improvements over where I was before so therefore I'd say the programming worked. At my training and physical age, getting a 5kg improvement over a few months from my starting point is good progress, I'm unlikely to see 20kg jumps in all time PBs now. The heavy single\/double followed by back off volume works very well for me. Gives me the best of both worlds of getting me strong and getting enough reps in. \n\n**What's next**:\n\nGiven my throwing season is starting soon, my next program will focus more on speed and power development, and less so on pushing 1RMs. I'll definitely go through another volume + strength block once the season is over and I'm focusing on building up a base again.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678550235.0},{"title":"March 11 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11ob9ut\/march_11_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678510879.0},{"title":"Candito 6 Week Review","author":"spiceboi1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11nwvur\/candito_6_week_review\/","text":"||Start||End||\n:--|--:|:--|--:|:--|\n|Bodyweight|76.2||75.8||\n|Height|170||170||\n|Age|24||24||\n|Fingers|10||10||\n|Girlfriends|0||0||\n||||||\n||Heaviest|Best Set|Heaviest|Best Set|\n|Squat|122.5|120 x 4|127.5|127.5 x 1 (considering depth)|\n|Bench|85|80 x 5|87.5|87.5 x 3|\n|Deadlift|152.5|140 x 5|155|155 x 3|\n\nGains were as expected. Difference in bodyweight is probably just water. Regarding squat, my depth before Candito was inconsistent. I also started using WL shoes from week 3. So when I tested I hit my max at full-depth A2G with great form, as in no forward lean, good-morning squat, loss of balance, or knee valgus. I do upright torso weightlifting style deep squats. I have yet to test my low-bar max for fun.\n\nWhat I learnt\n* Squat and Deadlifts same day can work very well. I used to be afraid of this before Candito, now I think it's perfect\n\n* Not working on a deadlift for a week and doing a variation instead was actually great for recovery and gains\n\n* Had a great chance to work on squat form during low intensity high rep sessions. It was at the perfect weight between heavy enough to be challenging so I can test my form and light enough to work on form\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n* I treat OHP like a strength movement, so that had to take a backseat during Candito, and the prescribed reps for shoulder accessories was too much\n\n* Barbell rows -  Jonny Candito himself does Sumo but I do conventional, and I felt doing rows on the upper day after deadlifts the previous day would leave me sore for a while. Not enough to hurt progress, but enough to be uncomfortable. Had to switch to Pendlay Rows to reduce lower back load\n\n* MR10 Squat Week 2 - I couldn't adequately recover from the first session to do well in the second. The squat intensity for the second volume week felt completely off for me. Squats were at perfect level except for the second week. No complaints on deadlift volume, it was perfect\n\n* Second Bench Press session in week 3 felt like it came out of nowhere and was the most intense upper session throughout the program. As per other reviews, not a huge fan of how bench has been set up, though I still made good progress. Bench volume was actually fine, but the intensity felt all over the place, and was too easy except for the week 3 second session which violated me\n\nI didn't change anything and did the program as prescribed. The main reason I chose Candito was to observe and learn, and to properly understand how undulating periodisation works and put into practice some of the theory I'd read. I've been lifting since 24th Sep 2022. I've made quick progression starting 3 day allbody for a few weeks, and tried a modified nSuns. Recovery was becoming hell the heavier I lifted, so I started reading up on many programs. Candito felt a good one to try for both its complexity and simplicity. \n\nMoving forward, Candito may be too advanced for me, the undulating periodisation is unnecessary for my stage and I'm going to try Texas Method until I properly plateau on weekly progression. I'm planning doing a variation of it for Oly Lifting suggested in Practical Programming, before eventually moving to Glenn Pendlay's program based off Texas Method. Another issue is Candito can't be adapted well for Oly lifting focus. For powerlifting PRs though Candito is a great program I'd definitely recommend.\n\n\nEDIT: Having thought it over, Candito's 6 week is an amazing powerlifting peaking program. It's something I would definitely hop on again if preparing for a meet or wanting to drive up my 1rm. However, it's not a program I would repeatedly follow for the off season, there are better programs for consistent volume\/hypertrothy and Candito doesn't work when wanting to focus on Oly lifting. Candito also has some widely documented issues regarding it's upper\/bench days.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678473118.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11nkyrd\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678442472.0},{"title":"March 10 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11nfbxv\/march_10_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678424484.0},{"title":"March 9 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11mjavn\/march_9_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678338079.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Loading\/Stones","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11lujx0\/weakpoint_wednesday_loadingstones\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

I ran SuperSquats from Jan-Feb 2023. I also started a base-building period for an ultra (in Aug 2023), ergo running mileage was high and building. I also tried to gain mass during this period, with some success.\n\n# Background\n\nRelevant things:\n\n* I've been running long distances since 2012 (predominantly ultras, trail marathons and the occasional country when I can bear to try mass-start races), lifting regularly since late 2017 (started with kettlebells, moved to barbell\/other things in late 2018). Otherwise regularly climbing, hiking, cycling, various martial arts.\n* I've been regularly (at least 3-4 times a week) since the age of 18. Basically no physical activity before then.\n* I'm 36, M, sedentary day job. Life stress is fairly minimal.\n* Last few programs before this have SBS Hypertrophy, SBS custom template, 531 BBBB (this with high mileage was An Experience) and most recently BBM Olympic Lifting template. My average mileage in 2022 barely eeked out to 25 miles a week following some serious hip issues in Jan 2022. Had some high mileage weeks but largely took it easy. First (and so far only) running injury.\n* Competed in a Strongman Show (Oxfordshire's Strongest Man) in June 2022. Came dead last and had an absolute blast!\n\nI decided to try SuperSquats as a try-hard programme before ultra mileage really picked up (I considered BBBB again but 3 times a week sounds more manageable), conveniently the \/gainit\/ party started soon after. I also wanted to get used to squatting with weightlifting shoes and this would give a lot of practice!\n\n# Program\n\nMost probably know the lifting bit, 2-3 times a week, start with a reasonable 10-rep weight and add 2.5\/5kg a session for 18 sessions, supersetting with pullovers. Additional exercises at a decent poundage to exercise other movements.\n\nI'd read a suggestion to aim for your 5RM for the final session so I went with that and worked backwards. Started at 50kg, took a 5kg jump and then 2.5kg a session. I originally started with one set of exercises (BtNP, Rows, Floor Press, Curls, SLDL, Ab wheel) but I had issues with heavy BtNP regularly, so took inspiration from our dear legendary berserker and switched to 2 sets of exercises and switched between them:\n\n1. Dips, DB Row, Axle Clean and Press, Curls\n2. BtNP, Rows, Incline DB Floor Press, Curls\n\nWeight wise I just progressed the smallest possible weight if I got all the reps for sets across.\n\nI did regular oly lifting essentially following Dan John's recommendation for Easy Strength for Cleans, and did occasional EMOMs with a BW sandbag and some farmer handles. \n\nOther activities were 5-6 days a week running, sporadic climbing, 2-4 hours HEMA a week and whatever random hikes I did with friends.\n\n# How it went\n\nNo E1RM because a) Don't massively care, b) Breathing squats, leads to some weird numbers.\n\nVideos - Please appreciate squat kitchen, it's a cosy venue\n\nFirst Set of 20 - [https:\/\/youtu.be\/P\\_uq59gU7CQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/P_uq59gU7CQ)\n\nLast set of 20 - [https:\/\/youtu.be\/qt7kRpxVBIA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/qt7kRpxVBIA)\n\nSome numbers, some fun, some not\n\n|Weights in kg|Start|End|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Age|36|36|\n|Weight|78kg|83kg|\n|Gender|M|M|\n|Squat |50kg|95kg|\n|BtNP|30kg 3x10|40kg 3x10|\n|Mileage|42mi\/wk peak, 34mi\/wk avg|1 speed session a week, otherwise all slow|\n\nI posted semi-regularly in the daily but in brief, the early weeks were quite doable, squats didn't interfere much with mileage nor vice-versa. By the end of week 3 I was exceptionally hungry. I don't count calories but I was eating every 3-4 hours. Outside meals I made good use of Greek yoghurt, peanut butter, bananas, seed and nut mixes. I drank a lot of liquids, probably 5L a day. I started getting some lingering soreness around the hips (not bad, just trying hard) in week 5 the day after a session but otherwise went good.\n\nResults\n\n* Back and hips feel a lot tighter when squatting. If you have ankle mobility issues (I have a borked left ankle due to a climbing injury) I highly recommend weightlifting shoes, my depth and form feel much more consistent. I also no longer get tired first in my lower back during high rep sets\n* Back as broad as a barn\n* Lungs as deep as the void\n* A much greater appreciation for what grinding a rep really feels like\n* Didn't die combining reasonable mileage and lifting\n* Gained weight with the above (the key is EAT THE FUCKING HOUSE)\n\n# Things going forward\n\nI went skiing for 2 weeks after, got hit by a massive storm in California and then scarpered back to the UK\n\nMOAR MILEAGE! I have a 50k in mid-May, a 100k in late June and 42 hours of self-navigating silliness in mid August (around 100 miles, if I read map good). I'm using TB Operator which will be a lovely change of pace. Mileage should peak at about 70mi\/week, and alas my thighs will likely diminish from their glory but that's what Autumn is for (and I really want to run Brian Alsruhe's EDC at some point).","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678204205.0},{"title":"Training Tuesday: 5\/3\/1 Part 1","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11kxfmz\/training_tuesday_531_part_1\/","text":"Welcome to Training Tuesdays, the weekly \/r\/weightroom training thread.

I fell in love with lifting heavy and wanted to learn everything about technique, programs and nutrition. I was 171 cm and 72 kg at the time. I followed the program for 3 or 4 months and brought my numbers up to: \\*Squat: 125 kg (`276 lbs)`, Bench: 85 kg (`187 lbs`), Deadlift: 155 kg (\\*`342 lbs)` *, Overhead Press: Can't remember, probably around 50 kg (*`110 lbs`*).*\n\nThen, I don't know what happened but I lost interest and gym was not a part of my life anymore. I still went to the gym from time to time, with some periods of consistancy, but no more that once a week most of the time. I was back to doing basis bodybuilding stuff as well. 5 years go by, I've gained a lot of weight and became lazy. This summer I weighed 85 kg and I said to myself: This needs to change. I started watching my food intake again and made an efford to go the gym again. When I remembered the good old 5x5 program, I became motivated again and remembered how well it went before. I follow this program for 2 months, before a came across the Texas Method. I basically started the texas method with the numbers I hit during stronglifts 5x5, minus a small deload.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Goals:\n\n**Stronglifts 5x5 Goal:** Lose fat and build muscle while trying to reach my old PR's again.\n\n**Texas Method Goal:** To join the 1000lb (455 kg) club for Squat, Bench and Deadlift. Side goal was to get closer to my goal of a bodyweight Overhead Press. I also wanted to join the 2\/3\/4 plate club.\n\n# Program:\n\nWe all now stronglifts so I will try to keep it to Texas Method only\n\nThe first 2 months were a 3-day texas method split with alternating Overhead Press and Bench Press.\n\nI set the volume days at about 90% of the intensity day. I added 2,5 kg every week for the big 4 and went by feeling for the accessories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Monday (Volume)**|**Wednesday (Recovery)**|**Friday (Intensity)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Squat  (5x5)|Front Squat (2x5)|Squat Intensity (1x5)|\n|Bench (5x5)|Overhead Press (5x5)|Bench Intensity (1x5)|\n|RDL (3x8)|Pull Ups 3x8-12|Deadlift Intensity (1x5)|\n|Dips|Barbell Rows 3x8-12|Incline DB press 3x8-12|\n|Hip Trust|Face Pulls 3x8-12|Triceps\/Biceps 3x8-12|\n\nBecause the Volume day was taking too long (1,5+ hours) I started to switch to a 4 day version that split the Upper Body and Lower Body and got rid of the recovery day because it didn't really do much for me personally. I did a small deload (10%) and just kept adding 2,5 kg each week (and 1 kg for overhead press this time). It looked like this for me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Monday**|**Thuesday**|**Thursday**|**Friday**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bench Intensity (1x5)|Squat Intensity (1x5)|Overhead Press Intensity (1x5)|Deadlift Intensity (1x5)|\n|Overhead Press Volume (5x5)|RDL\/Deficit Deadlifts Volume (4x8)|Bench Volume (5x5)|Squat Volume (5x5)|\n|Incline DB press 3x8|Lat Pulldown 3x10-12|Weighted Dips 3x8|Chin Ups 3x10-12|\n|Triceps\/rear delts  3x10-12|Tbar Row  3x10-12|Triceps  3x10-12 |Machine Row 3x10-12|\n||Biceps||Biceps|\n\n# Diet:\n\nDiet has always been the hardest part of fitness for me. I struggle to find consistancy and beat myself up for making bad food choices. I finally found a way for myself to keep food choices simples by eating the same thing every day (except for dinner, because I like to keep my girlfriend happy as well). During stonglifts I limited myself to 1800 kcals a day and during texas method I tried to eat at maintance most of the time (around 2000 on \"strict\" days).  Protein intake was between 120 g and 150 g a day. 80% of the time I stuck to my daily goal but I made the occasional bad choice and drank alcohol about once a week.  \n\nEvery day would look like this:\n\n*Breakfast: overnight protein oats or 4 eggs with some bacon*\n\n*Lunch: tortilla wrap with hummus, blue cheese, spinach and chicken or tuna*\n\nDinner: anything, around 600-700 kcal and 25+ g of protein\n\nSnacks: Fruit, protein shake\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Experience:\n\nI really like the idea of alternating volume and intensity. I just makes sense to me. Building strenght and displaying it. It kept things fresh for me and got me out of the boring 3x10 mindset. The original 3 day version just was to much for me. I tried to keep adding exercises because I felt I didn't hit certain movements\/muscles enough, which made some days way to long. It just felt like a missed a day, which is exactly what the 4 day version gave me. \n\nDoing a the major excercises 2 times a week was just perfect for me and seems like a very sustainable way of training. You will get just enough practice, while keeping enough time for recovery because your muscles will always get at least 2 or 3 days rest. \n\nThe 4 day split is also very flexible because you are alternating  between Push and Legs\/Pull. You don't always have to train mo-tu-th-fr. The only thing you have to make sure is that you have to have 2 days of rest between training the same muscle group. No time on tuesday? just do squats on a wednesday. It's alright because it doesn't interfere with the next training. \n\nAll days were pretty much sub 1,5 hours which is fine by me. They could be much shorter if you skip the bicep\/ tricep stuff and really want to focus on the basics.\n\n# Tests:\n\nThe last 3 weeks I have been practicing with heavy weights in the 1-3 rep range and reduced my volume to peak a little before testing my 1RM\u2019s. I did my Overhead Press, Deadlift, Bench & Squat on tuesday, wednesday, thursday & Friday respectively.\n\nDuring training my best lifts and estimated 1RM's were: \n\nSquat: 150 kg x 4  \\~ 169 kg\n\nBench:  102,5 kg x 3 \\~ 112 kg\n\nDeadlift: 175 kg x 3 \\~ 191 kg\n\nOverhead Press: 60 kg x 3 \\~ 65 kg\n\n# Results:\n\nBiometrics: Male, 26, 171 cm (5\"7)\n\nPR videos are linked \n\n||**Start SL5x5**        `01-08-2022`|**TM week 1**           `03-10-2022`|**TM week 20**         `28-02-2023`|**TM Gain**|**Total Gain**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Bodyweight**|85 kg                            `187 lbs`|78 kg                         `172 lbs`|80 kg              `176 lbs`|2 kg                               `4,4 lbs`|\\-5 kg                               `-11 lbs`|\n|**Squat**|100 kg                 `220 lbs`|132,5 kg                `292 lbs`|[**175 kg**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/A8yy8rX)`386 lbs`|42,5  kg                      `94 lbs`|75 kg                          `165 lbs`|\n|**Bench Press**|80 kg                 `176 lbs`|92,5 kg              `204 lbs`|[**115 kg**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/s4ND2bV)`254 lbs`|22,5 kg                   `50 lbs`|35 kg                         `77 lbs`|\n|**Deadlift**|120 kg               `265 lbs`|155 kg                `342 lbs`| [**190 kg**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ooekR5u)`419 lbs`|35 kg                      `77 lbs`|70 kg                            `154 lbs`|\n|**Overhead Press**|\\~ 55 kg                  `121 lbs`|60 kg                        `132 lbs`|[**67,5 kg**](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8PiWThX)`149 lbs`|7,5 kg                         `17 lbs`|12,5 kg                     `28 lbs`|\n|**Big 3 Total**|300 kg                          `661 lbs`|380 kg                     `838 lbs`|480 kg                          `1058 lbs`|100 kg                      `220 lbs`|180 kg                          `397 lbs`|\n\nThe calculators were sometimes a little of (on the low side) but gave a pretty good estimate\n\n[Physique pics before and after.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/qv9w6sn)\n\nConclusion:\n\nI accomplished my goal of breaking the 1000 Club was earlier than I hoped for (aimed for may\/July) and finally hit the 2\/3\/4 plate club. I also found out that the squat is my favorite lift. And most important of all, I found my passion for lifting again! The texas method is great for intermediates who have reached the end of their stronglift 5x5 training and want to keep making some linear progression.\n\n# What's next:\n\nI really liked the program but I want to change some things up, because setting a new rep PR every week became a bit taxing. I want something more sustainable in the long run. I found out about GZCL and \"The Rippler\" will be my next program. It is very similar to my 4-day texas method split so I won't need much getting used to. I will incorporate some weak point training for the first time by focussing on bench lockout (Close Grip Bench & 2'Board Press). After12 weeks I am aiming for a 500 kg SBD total and a 70 kg overhead press, while keeping my physique relatively lean.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677860844.0},{"title":"[Program Review]: Super Squats 3: The Revenge!","author":"MythicalStrength","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11go5su\/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge\/","text":"Folks, as of my writing of this, I am one workout away from finishing my third run of Super Squats.  What makes this one unique is that this run of Super Squats comes on the tail of a prior run, with a 6 week break in between: an idea proposed by the very author of Super Squats, Randall Strossen.  I wrote in a previous blog entry regarding Duality via Periodization on how I trained in between the two runs of Super Squats, effectively trying to UNDO Super Squats and prep for another run, and found that to be ultimately beneficial.   What was also unique about this run compared to the previous run is that I did NOT contract RSV at the start of it, nor did I tear my hamstring in the 2nd week, so I got to have my revenge and really give Super Squats the full \u201cMythical Strength\u201d treatment. \n\nI wanted to document how this run went and what lessons I learned from it, because that\u2019s why we do these things.\n\n---\n**HOW I SET UP THE TRAINING**\n\n* I stuck with my 2 different training day approach, alternated in an A-B-A, B-A-B style approach.  Day A was a superset of axle clean once and strict press away with pull aparts, weighted dips w\/axle rows, squats with pull overs, axle SLDLs, and poundstone curls, day B was a superset of incline DB bench and weighted chins, behind the neck press and pull aparts, squats and pull overs, and then an unbroken circuit of single set work of kroc rows into axle shrugs against bands into reverse hypers.  Each day also included standing ab wheel, glute ham raises, pushdowns, and some form of short conditioning work to end the training day.\n\n* Around the 5 week mark, I started cutting stuff out of the training days.  Biggest issue was my forearms\/elbows from the frequent squatting.  They were in a significant degree of pain, and started limiting movement.  I removed weighted dips entirely, replacing them with a burnout set of flat benching with 20lb DBs (worked up to a max of 160 unbroken reps), and I\u2019d play the Day A workout by ear on if I\u2019d do the SLDLs or not.  \n\n* Week 5 was also unique in that it\u2019s when I broke from the standard \u201cSingle set of 20, add weight next time\u201d approach to one where I rotated between reps and different movements, once again in an attempt to spare my forearms.  I adopted an approach that had me do my heavy squat day on the first day of the week, then a lighter squat with 30+ reps for the middle workout, and then a Safety Squat Bar squat for 20 rep workout on Friday.  I\u2019ll speak more to that later.\n\n* On the days between Super Squats workouts, I\u2019d do 30 minute fasted conditioning workouts.  I almost never did the same one twice, and usually based it around what hurt the least to train and what could promote recovery for workouts.  On weekends, I found myself doing the Grace WOD from Crossfit with an axle pretty frequently, and would do some wild variations of it, like hitting it 3 times in a row with some burpee chins and swings in between or doing one every 10 minutes.  Pretty much just winging it.  I also practiced Tang Soo Do twice a week and had various other stints of physical activity. \n\n**HOW IT WENT**\n\n* If you care to watch the full run of the program, [here is the playlist]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rd_Kf7YoiX0&list=PLfcuGAffLlScyXsCOwVXhuFVErM4Geyhc).  With me starting at 335 for 23 reps, lighter weight allowing for higher reps as I broke into the program.\n\n* Without question, this was my most successful run of Super Squats, and one of my most successful runs of any program in general.  I hit some amazing lifts.  I feel the crowning achievement was [20x400lbs]( https:\/\/youtu.be\/lAICWL-nGMY)\n\n\n* Yes, I did in fact manage [20x405]( https:\/\/youtu.be\/sL05YuXIpv0) later in the program And it had quite a dramatic finish, but I absolutely dominated the set of 400 and felt the rep quality was high, whereas 405 was barely there, and I know I went short on the final rep just for the sake of getting the 20 in. Will I still count it?  F- -k yeah I will, but I also intend to come back sometime and get it clean.\n\n* Also got [35x315]( https:\/\/youtu.be\/rJx9g_ip2Tg), which was gnarly\n\n\n* And in an attempt to top it, I did [33x315, then, after feeling sorry for myself for 20 seconds, got back up and got in 7 more reps for a total of 40]( https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ry1zrSmP1cw)\n\n\n* On top of all that, my incline dumbbell benching went from 3x12x95 to 110lbs, Behind the neck press from 3x10x120 to 145 and weighted dips capped out from 3x12x90 to 115 before I had to tap out from elbow pain.\n\n* My chins, rows and SLDLs also progressed incredibly well, but in that regard I entered the program recovering from a torn lat\/tricep which had it so that I couldn\u2019t do a single unweighted chin to start the program, and rows and SLDLs were stupidly light.  By the end of the program, I could do 2x15x25lb weighted chins, axle rows with 230lbs and axle SLDLs with 301lbs.\n\n* Oh yeah, and I didn\u2019t weigh myself at the start of the program, but the day before the final workout I stepped on the scale after my post-workout shower and saw 201.0. [ I still have ab veins]( https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UqOdqBJ.jpg).  I\u2019ve never been this heavy and lean before, so that\u2019s cool.\n\n**HOW IT WENT AWRY**\n\n* As I\u2019ve mentioned a few times now: elbow pain became the variable.  And I write \u201celbow\u201d, but really, it\u2019s more like forearm flexor\/extenders.  It\u2019s a byproduct of the stupidly low bar style of squat I employ, and I know it\u2019s playing with fire whenever I do prolonged frequent squat workouts like this.  I experienced a similar issue on a run of Building the Monolith a while back.  It\u2019s most likely why I tend to gravitate toward programs where I squat only once a week.\n\n* But I was also stupid in my conditioning exercise selection at the start.  I was doing a LOT of kettlebell cleans and snatches, and those TOO tend to jack up my elbows pretty badly.  Pairing them together on such an intense training program was a recipe for disaster, and once I crossed the point of no return on pain there was no course correction available aside from \u201cdrastic measures\u201d.  Pain was beginning to influence training decisions, I was cutting movements out of the program or re-arranging things so that I wouldn\u2019t go into the squat with so much pain that it distracted me from the set, and my conditioning became based around \u201cwhat will hurt the least\u201d.  I had to stop my daily ABCs or TABEARTAs for similar reasons.  \n\n* Eventually, after failing my first attempt at 405lbs, I had to make a change.  Now, that failure happened on an off-day as it was, since it was the president\u2019s day holiday, so I trained in the afternoon rather than the morning, after a morning of \u201cTop Golf\u201d and different food than I normally have, but it was also the first workout of the program where I approached the bar with trepidation rather than an assurance that I was going to succeed, and it was due to the sheer pain I\u2019d endure in simply UNRACKING the bar.\n\n* So I took a lesson learned from my previous run of Super Squats and decided to go for a set of 30+ reps.  That\u2019s where the set of 35x315 happened, which was awesome, and I walked away feeling BETTER but not fully healed.  The next course of action was to use the Safety Squat Bar and completely remove the elbows from the equation.  That worked, and it was a challenging workout, but much like I wrote previously: the SSB just doesn\u2019t create the same effect.  When you breathe at the top of the squat with the SSB, you can really rest.  You aren\u2019t being crushed, you\u2019re in a peaceful state, you can regather and recompose.  With a bar on your back, that time is murder.  I can\u2019t see running a full cycle of Super Squats with a SSB being successful, but I can definitely see benefits of rotating it in as part of the program.  And in that regard\u2026\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED AND FUTURE IDEAS**\n\n* Running a cycle of Super Squats where I worked up to 30 reps prior to this one was brilliant and totally unintended.  It legit made 20 reps feel mundane.  I was so used to the work STARTING at the 20 rep mark that I\u2019d often not realize I was \u201cdone\u201d with my set until around rep 18 or 19.  And they were STILL hard sets of 20, no question, but, mentally, there was no battle whatsoever.  I was conditioned to not even think about those first 15 reps, since they were \u201chalfway\u201d to the end and I didn\u2019t want to get into my own head before that time.\n\n* There\u2019s nothing wrong with some short conditioning sessions between Super Squats workouts to keep appetite high and recover from training, but movement selection is crucial.  Death by a thousand cuts can happen, and once you\u2019re on the wrong side of it, it\u2019s too late to fix.\n\n* I didn\u2019t write about nutrition, because mine is so stupidly nuanced and insane that it\u2019s cumbersome to do so, but I once again did not do the gallon of milk a day, and I once again say that, if you CAN, you should.  I was pretty much eating non-stop through the program.  If I had to work late, my whole evening got compromised and I would end up literally spending the time I got home to the time I went to sleep eating (I say without hyperbole, I\u2019d eat my last meal, go upstairs, brush my teeth and go to bed.  All the people worried about eating before bed messing with their sleep can f- -k right off.)  I had a lunchbox full of food that I\u2019d bring to work and eat something at least once an hour out of it, to say nothing of the snacks I kept in my desk, to say nothing of the gigantic breakfast I had BEFORE work.  And after I ate breakfast, I would do the dishes, have a snack, get my kid in the car, drop them off at school and then eat my CAR SNACK on my way to work, where I\u2019d eat my \u201cI got to work snack\u201d as soon as I sat down.  People: a gallon of milk a day is so much simpler.  Also, I need to get sponsored by Nuts \u2018n More, because I was going through a container a week, easily.\n\n* At one point, squatting around 400lbs every other day for 20 reps just takes a toll on the body that cannot be recovered from if one is not drinking a gallon of milk a day (still gonna keep plugging that).  Next time I run Super Squats, I want to try an approach where I have 3 distinct approaches to the squat.  The first day of the week will be a traditional 20 reps.  The next day will be a lighter weight for 30+ reps.  The final day will be the Safety Squat Bar for 20 reps.  This is the layout I used for the last 2 weeks of this run of Super Squats, and I think it has a TON of merit.  Primarily, that heavy set is the first one of the week, so I effectively have 6 days to recover from it before I have to do it again.  Yeah, the middle workout is still a barbell squat workout, but the lighter weight is far less taxing on my elbows, and the SSB is completely forgiving of it, so I get to spend a lot of time healing\/recovering.  As far as progression goes, I\u2019m thinking 10lb jumps each week for the sets of 20, and going up a rep or so a week for the high rep work.  I\u2019ve considered making the workout 1 and 2 weight the same at the start of the program and going from there as well: hitting 20 reps with it on workout 1, 21 on workout 2, and then when workout 4 rolls around go up 10lbs, then going up 1 rep on workout 5.  Lots of ways to succeed.  There\u2019s also the possibility of swapping out the SSB day with a trap bar day too.    \n\n* Randall Strossen\u2019s idea of \u201c6 weeks of Super Squats, then 6 weeks of a 5x5 bulk and power program, then 6 weeks of Super Squats\u201d is right on the money.  I really overlooked that gem the first time I read the book, and even the second time, but after enough re-reads it really clicked, and this was a fantastic experiment in that regard.  You don\u2019t need to run the exact 5x5 bulk and power program, but take the lesson it\u2019s presenting: do a program with 1 set of a lot of reps, then do a program of a lot of sets of few reps.  It was stupid simple periodization and it was there all along.  And keep reading the rest of the book, where Randall talks about doing 2x15 or 3x10 or 1x30 and you see all the ways you can keep making Super Squats \u201cwork\u201d.  That book, no joke, should be the first book any serious trainee reads regarding training.  It gives you a plan you can follow for life and imparts SO much knowledge.  \n\n**THE FUTURE?**\n\n* Plan is to take a 1 week deload, and then I\u2019m thinking of the 6 week base phase of 5\/3\/1 Krypteia, as I have a 10 mile race I need to be in shape for in Apr, and the time with lower reps, higher sets, timed workouts, assistance work and an opportunity for running should all pay off.  I\u2019m also thinking of experimenting with a pseudo Apex Predator\/Velocity Diet, seeing how I can fit it in as someone with social\/family obligations around mealtimes, but quite frankly I\u2019m sick of cooking, cleaning and eating, so an opportunity to live off of shakes for a while sounds amazing.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677809203.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11gwx5m\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677837671.0},{"title":"March 3 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11gruyo\/march_3_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677819684.0},{"title":"How To PUSH Through PRESSING PROBLEMS - 4 Injury Work Arounds","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FA73XYyoPbw","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677781427.0},{"title":"[program review] The Abomination","author":"Eddy_Hancock1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11g3vzr\/program_review_the_abomination\/","text":"**OVERVIEW**\n\n[Here is the spreadsheet I found.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1BikP3XbyJiILJQR8BDAyhecHl4X-_4PJo2qEjKrxHaQ\/edit#gid=0) I personally prefer pen and paper, so I wrote out the program and did the maths myself.\n\nThe Abomination is a Franken program combining the Russian Squat routine, Mag\/Ort Lite and Pushing the Monolith. I don't know who made it, I cant find any reviews of it, and I cant find another reference to 'Pushing the Monolith' anywhere (though its easy to see the Building the Monolith influence), but it looked interesting, so I went for it.  I've also been eying Mag\/Ort and Russian style routines for awhile, and this seemed to conveniently fit the bill.\n\nIf I had to describe the purpose of this program, Id say it's for peaking your lower body while building upper body mass, but really it was just something fun to do and expose myself to training outside of 531.\n\nFor context, I went into this program following BBB Beefcake, so I theoretically had some unrealized potential from muscle gain coming into this.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nTLDR, its complicated, but I started proper weight training in December of 2021, running 531 variants for all the time leading up to this program.\n\nI've always been physically active, if not always physically fit. I was in Taekwondo \\~9-13, then 13-18 was in wrestling. In grade twelve, I also started 'weight training', but it was a far cry from anything productive. After graduation, I got a shitty weight bench with a safety rating of 300lbs max (including the occupant) and continued to do enough work to tell myself I was doing something, but never really got anywhere.\n\nAround age 20, I got access to a gym with exclusively machine equipment and went so hard on upper body day I think Jon Anderson would be proud (I'm talking machine benching up to a max, laddering back down, getting a buddy to help me do negatives as a drop set till I cant hold up 5lbs, then super setting chest flys and pushups till I cant anymore). Lower body was almost nonexistent, and usually turned into cardio days. After a bit over a year, I lost access to the gym and reverted back to my shitty bench.\n\nThis entire time my weight stayed at 150-160lbs (yes, including 9 year old me). Over the last year I've been gaining weight, and who knew that the catalyst for growth... is growth.\n\nAfter finding r\/fitness, I learned a lot and bought a power rack in December of 2021, and ran nSuns for 9 weeks. Since then I've ran FSL, BTM, GVT, Coffinworm and Beefcake x2, which brings us up to this program.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Age|25||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Height|5'6\"||\n|Weight|186.5lb|194lb|\n|Chest|41 3\/4\"|42\"|\n|Neck|15\"|15\"|\n|Waist|37 1\/4\"|38\"|\n|Navy Method BF%|25.1%|26.3%|\n|Arms (L\/R) Relaxed|14 3\/8\" \/ 14 3\/8\"|15 1\/8\" \/ 14 3\/4\"|\n|Arms (L\/R) Flexed|Forgot to Record...|15 5\/8\" \/ 15\"|\n|Thighs (L\/R)|23 1\/4\" \/ 24 5\/8\"|24\" \/ 25 1\/8\"|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Lifts|Before PRs|Before e1RM|After Tested 1RM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|OHP|165|160X3=176|175|\n|DL|430|410X4=451|465|\n|BS|300|275X5=321|360|\n|BB|260|240X5=280|280|\n\nAside from the squat, there really isn't a huge improvement from e1RM-1RM, but I feel its better than it appears because I can never hit e1RM numbers, I'm just good at getting reps. I also didn't do a deload week prior to testing, testing was my deload.\n\nFor the deadlift AMRAPs, I hit 13 reps every week except week 5, which I got 12 reps. When testing, I tried and failed 480 3x, getting it up about 2-3 inches each time, then was still able to get 465. This makes me believe 480 was there, but I just couldn't grind it out.\n\nAs noted in the table, my test for bench was 240x5 before the program. My final bench session I did 5x5 @ 240, so there was some kind of improvement there.\n\nI don't think I can really express how happy I am with my squat. My squat test was 275x5. My Final AMRAP was 300x6, which was also my weight PR before. In truth, I was just hoping to hit 315 by the end to say I got 3 plates, so 360 was a genuine surprise, and it was smooth as hell. I'm also glad I got some breathing room between it and my bench.\n\nNothing of note happened for my press, but given the volume of pressing, I was likely fatigued going into testing. I do think, however, I have more delt definition.\n\n**CONDITIONING**\n\nOnce a week, every week, I did a variation of Tower of Babel, typically Front squats paired with ABCs, and once I did KB swings because my knees were bothering me. I also did 20min TABEARTA sessions, EMOM ABCs, and KB Swings for time. I only had a maximum of 1 day fully off per a week, totaling 4 days off in 6 weeks.\n\n**WHAT WORKED**\n\nI'm honestly amazed at how well Russian Squats and Mag\/Ort Lite fit together. They don't interfere with each other at all, and I feel my deadlifts benefitted from the squat technique work as a warm up. I think I'm going to keep this combo in my back pocket for peaking in the future.\n\nThe high frequency of squats clearly did wonders for my squat. The confidence I gained under the bar from so many touches cannot be understated.\n\nMag\/Ort Lite really helped me touch higher weights than I was used to training with.\n\n**WHAT DIDNT WORK**\n\nThe barbell rows are programmed in a really dumb way, being based off of your deadlift TM. I don't know if my row is crap or what, but I failed week 2 horribly. The obvious solution would be to lower the weight to where I can do proper rows, but that's boring. Instead I increased the percentages by 10% and did Rubbish rows for the first time, and I feel it worked really well, though I probably could have increased the weight a bit more even.\n\nFor me, mentally, there is just too much close grip bench. I made it through the first 3 weeks, but 300 reps a week is just too much, and my regular bench grip was starting to feel awkward. Weeks 4-6 I swapped out the day 1 CGBB for dips, and left the day 3 the same.\n\nThis program is time consuming if you don't have a second barbell to work in super sets. This was a huge benefit of substituting in the dips as mentioned above. I strongly recommend either using a second bar, or swapping in some dumbbell variations. Otherwise, be prepared to spend almost 2 hours lifting some days.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThis was a fun experiment to run this program. IMO there is flaws with the program as written, but I picked up some things I enjoyed and am likely to incorporate into future training, so in that sense I believe it was a good program for me to run and step outside of the box.\n\nShoutout to the Reddit fitness community for being such a positive influence on my life and inspiring me to pursue dramatic changes in how I view fitness and how I pursue my goals.\n\nNow, unfortunately, spring is approaching and its time to cut a little blubber off. Then I plan on running Bromley's Kong, then Bullmastiff. Hopefully 2\/3\/4\/5 plates will come this year, but we shall see.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677766685.0},{"title":"March 2 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11ftk9a\/march_2_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677733280.0},{"title":"What are your thoughts on programless training?","author":"Dramatic_Quote_4267","url":"https:\/\/plagueofstrength.com\/for-the-last-time-old-time-strongmen-strongwomen-and-other-elite-lifters-neither-dieted-nor-followed-program-and-they-would-mock-the-shit-out-of-you-for-doing-both\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677687599.0},{"title":"MythicalStrength speaks on the nature of physical transformation","author":"JeremiahWuzABullfrog","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/sC5HdRWyG9Q","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677632122.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Carries","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/11f1ywo\/weakpoint_wednesday_carries\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

My wife and I both joined a gym a few years ago and I started making it priority after our free one on one personal trainer deal had some feedback for me that wasn\u2019t great. I had gotten pretty chunky so I began with Starting Strength and running, both of which I enjoyed. Ended up doing a bunch of different programs and ended up training for and running a half marathon a few years back and was lifting in conjunction with my running. A few months later, I ended up hurting my back during a deadlift and couldn\u2019t run or so anything where my back wasn\u2019t supported so I gained a bit of weight back but my pressing got decent. Got back into it all and just kind of spun my wheels program hopping and being very cautious with my back. Pandemic hits and ended up doing some running. Really missed the lifting aspect of it all but had to do something to keep the pudge down. Ended up becoming a dad and moving into a house with a garage where I built out a home gym and have fully embraced it. I have been running and lifting in tandem for the past two years. Mostly still taking everything slow to be able to make progress in both and have longevity but still doing it nonetheless.\n\nLeading up to the start of running 531 BtFI, I had run a Garmin 10k training plan and the SBS hypertrophy RTF 4x and wanted to focus more on getting stronger. I had felt like I stalled a bit while trying to push both and wasn\u2019t happy with it so I wanted to focus on weights after the 10k race I had planned. I also wanted to do something that gave percentages, since I am terrible with RPE, and immediately thought of 531. I\u2019ve run it in the past but have always been a little disappointed with results which lead to not being consistent with it. It always felt like my Squat and DL would do ok while my Bench and OHP would maybe move or maybe not. I had moved away from 531 for that very reason and wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough to know how to appropriately add more volume and practice in. This was changed after finding the post by u\/TheMightyGullet.\n\nProgram\n\nThe program: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/rudoce\/program\\_review\\_531\\_bomb\\_the\\_fitness\\_industry\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/rudoce\/program_review_531_bomb_the_fitness_industry\/)\n\nI wanted to run this after reading the post and seeing the combo of BBB and BBS as well as the extra volume and power days and decided to do it after my race. You can read all about the program in the post so I will just mention what I did differently. I ran a 5k on the power and volume days before lifting and also ran a 10k on non-lifting days for the Leaders. Once I got the Anchor I switched to Low Heart Rate Training to allow for more of a focus on strength realization. I only had time for one super-set of accessories after the main lifts instead of two like mentioned. I definitely didn\u2019t get enough walking in outside of the running days so my conditioning probably could have been better. I also didn\u2019t track how I ate but I made protein a priority and backed off drinking a lot which probably led to the slight weight loss. I am still fat so no progress pictures, sorry team.\n\nHow it went\n\nResults first here for your enjoyment. The estimated nature of the 1RM\u2019s get a little wacky with some of the higher reps that I got but I used the same calculator for all of the estimations.\n\n  \n\n|In lbs|Pre Rep Maxes|Pre E1RM|Post Rep Maxes|Post E1RM|Change in E1RM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Squat|275x3|291|265x12|371|\\+80|\n|Deadlift|330x1|330|320x8|397|\\+67|\n|Bench|225x4|246|215x10|286|\\+40|\n|OHP|125x5|141|125x9|161|\\+20|\n|Age||31||32|\\+1|\n|Weight||230||225|\\-5|\n\nI posted daily updates on the Daily Thread if you want a more thorough walkthrough but I thought it went perfectly. I know I\u2019m not as strong as most around here and I was a bit nervous to jump back into weights after having truly split my training and not focused on them as much and I was met with a pretty darn good response from my body. Even though I probably had my TM\u2019s too high for the first cycle, everything really got to moving well by the end of the first Leader and continued through to the second Leader. The only issue I had was dealing with some shoulder stuff after higher volume OHP and Bench days but that was relatively easily remedied by facepulls and more thorough warm ups for those movements.\n\nI had hit the 1000 lb club earlier in the year last year but knew my strength had dropped off so I was very pleased to put almost 200 lbs on the big three total to get me back over 1k and 20 on my OHP. I still want a bit more which brings me to\u2026\n\nThings going forward\n\nI have taken inspiration from 531 BTFI and combined FSL, BBB, and BBS into a 3x week lifting and 3x week running program to see how long I can ride this train. I know I can\u2019t handle this volume forever so I am planning to back off after a bit. For running, everything is LHRT to allow myself to keep my conditioning up somewhat for lifting without hard runs getting in the way of recovery. I am doing a lot of supersets and giant sets and have spread out the accessories across all 6 days to allow for everything to fit into my available timeframe. My goal is to do 3 cycles of this and have a test week to see how I do (break 1100 lbs would be nice) and then back off on the volume, increase intensity and start ramping up on the running a bit leading into the summer.

I usually compete in the U200\/90kg class, but for a fun challenge I decided to compete in the U265\/120kg weight class. I weighed in a bit fluffy, around 227 after drinking and eating a bunch on the way to the comp, with my backpack, coat, and shoes on. That morning I actually weighed 220.\n\nOne big mistake that I made was changing to heavy weight last minute after thinking I was going to do U231\/105kg class. Because of this I trained at a percentage of the lower weight classes weights and suffered a bit when I was given the heavier weights.\n\nThat being said, the whole point of this competition was to push myself so I could perform better in my own weight class. The mistake wasn't moving up to heavy weight, but instead, training at the middle weight classes and I should have been doing heavy weight all along.\n\n\\----------\n\n**Event 1:** [600 pound yoke for 50 feet, set down, 50 feet back. Best time wins.](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/Colax76p0YC\/)\n\n*Results: 2nd place, losing to first place by about .5 seconds.* \n\nI hadn't trained yoke super hard because I find it very taxing. Instead, I made sure that I could carry the competition weight fairly quickly early on in my training and then every Saturday I would use somewhere between 60-70% of the competition weight and run it as a medley with frame or something else, focusing on speed.\n\n**Event 2:** [Log Clean and Press, 240 Clean and Press for reps in 60 seconds](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/ComxZNZjBTk\/)\n\n*Results: Tied for 3rd with 3 reps, 2 reps behind the winner*\n\nExcuses: The log was 14 inches and it crushed me. It was hard to clean, it was hard to press. It should have been a weight that I could do for 5-7 reps, but I wasn't prepared. I also blame training with the U231 weight of 220 in training. I was getting 8 reps of that and didn't think the 20 pound jump would be too big of a deal. I was wrong.\n\nLessons learned: I have a bigger log and I need to practice with it. I choose not to because it's harder. I paid for that mistake in the competition. First mistake of the day and it started with training.\n\n**Event 3:** [425 pound axle\/wagon wheel deadlift for reps in 60 seconds (no straps)](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/ColluepjnzH\/)\n\n*Results: 2nd place with 18 reps, losing to 1st place by 1 rep*\n\nLessons learned: I would have easily taken first if I would have just kept deadlifting. I got inside my head that I couldn't beat the 1st place guy so I should just focus on taking second. With 10 seconds to spare I stepped back and only did 1 more rep as time expired. I could have easily gotten 2-3 more reps in that time frame and taken first in the event. It came back to be costly in the overall placing.\n\n**Event 4:** [Duck walk into power stairs, 375 pounds](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/ColouwYj_K0\/)\n\n*Results: 2nd place, 1st place was quite a bit faster*\n\nNot much to say, I was looking forward to this event and also ready for it to be over because it was a bit sketch with how narrow the steps were. Now that I understand how this event works I think I can do it much faster next time. I was just making it up on the spot.\n\n**Event 5:** [Frame carry, 600 pounds for 50 feet down, turn around, 50 feet back](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cok7tKnS7pb\/)\n\n*Results: 5th, tore both of my hands wide open.*\n\nToo much blood and pain for me to continue to pick up the frame. It wouldn't have mattered either way. I am not good at the frame\/farmers and didn't train it very hard. I paid for it. 4th place would have guaranteed me a 2nd place overall. 5th knocked me down to 3rd place by .5 points.\n\nGrip continues to be a big weakness and I need to get serious about training it. As soon as my hands heal up.\n\n\\----------\n\n**Overall:**\n\n3rd place in the U265, 1st place was California's Strongest Man in the U231 last year so I was happy that I was able to keep up with such a strong athlete for most of the day. A few costly mistakes that I need to take into my next competitions, a big ego hit dropping down to 3rd, and pissed off that I didn't  perform like I expected. \n\nI make up for it when I compete again in April.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676416375.0},{"title":"February 15 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/112pzhx\/february_15_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676437269.0},{"title":"Training Tuesday: FrankenPrograms","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/1123pjz\/training_tuesday_frankenprograms\/","text":"Welcome to Training Tuesdays, the weekly \/r\/weightroom training thread.

I made significant progress. And I probably didn't eat enough.   \n  \n**Background:** I am 42\/M\/6'3\" and have ran all sorts of programs through the years like Ice Cream 5x5, All-Pro's, Arnold Split, 5\/3\/1's, Super Squats, and the Texas Method just to name a few. Some of those programs are definitely better than others especially in terms of built in recovery and progress, IMO. Like many people I've learned what I like and what works for me in terms of making gains.  \n\n**Building the Monolith:** I feel like BtM is pretty well known at this point, at least to the denizens of Reddit.  \/u\/ColdGrasp recently posted a really good [review](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10ueg5k\/program_review_building_the_monolith_coldgrasp\/) of the program. But long story short, [Building the Monolith](https:\/\/www.jimwendler.com\/blogs\/jimwendler-com\/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) is, to me, a conditioning program more than anything else. I've ran this program before and found it to be pretty straight forward: eat big, lift big, condition big, and then eat some more.   \n\nI wanted to go hard on conditioning for a long period of time, so I decided why not give BtM a try for 2 cycles instead of 1. 6 weeks + 1 week deload + 6 more weeks.  \n\n**Changes to the Program:**  \n\n* I trained 7 days instead of 6. The 7th day was reserved for cardio. \n* I did some form of conditioning every day. I also ran every day. More on that below.\n* I did the weighted vest walk once. I didn't care for it and ditched it. \n* On Friday's widowmaker squat sets, I'd occasionally up the % higher to 75% or so.  \n* DB rows were swapped out for pendlay rows.\n\n**Running the Program:**  \nMy typical week looked like this:  \n  \n* Sunday: 10k run  \n* Monday: Day 1, light\/moderate conditioning, 5k run\n* Tuesday: Prowler, 5k run   \n* Wednesday: Day 2, light\/moderate conditioning, 5k run  \n* Thursday: Moderate to hard conditioning, 5k run  \n* Friday: Day 3, light\/moderate conditioning, 5k run\n* Saturday: Air Dyne bike for 10 miles, 5k run    \n\nI ran everything at 85% of my TM's. I also estimated my TM's and frankly, probably went a little lower than where my actual 1RM's are at currently because of the fact I set out to run the program for a longer period of time.  That and I wanted to focus more on conditioning than anything else.\n\nSome thoughts on the program itself: \n  \n* 200 Dips - to me, these were (by far) the most difficult part of the prescribed lifts. Doing 200 dips in addition to everything else on Day 1 was HARD. I had to break them up to ensure I wasn't spending more than 90 minutes in all training that day (not counting the running time here) \n* 100 Chins - like the 200 dips, these were really hard and made my arms feel like they were going to fall off  \n* Squats\/OHP - One of the reasons why I picked BtM is how it focuses a lot on squats and overhead presses, 2 of my favorite work outs. I'm in agreement with many people who feel that the squat is the tops of all the different barbell movements you can do. It's so effective at...everything.  \n* The dip in the percentages in the middle week of each 3-week block was a nice touch. This program was hard and this sort of break of was necessary.   \n* I didn't program the rows, curls, band pull aparts, or weighted chin ups. I just did whatever felt challenging that week. \n\n**Conditioning:**  \nYou MUST do conditioning. This is required and this is where I really tried to make progress. \nThe \"light conditioning\" was anything from KB swings to jump ropes to box jumps. The \"hard conditioning\" was anything from burpees to a WOD to something terrible from  \/u\/MythicalStrength's [Little Book of Bad Ideas] (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/pimzfr\/per_request_my_free_ebook_mythical_strengths\/).  The Tower of Babel is probably the hardest conditioning anything I've ever ran. That left me gasping for air by the end of it, which made the subsequent 5k run even more difficult.  But for these, I wanted to change things up from week to week so I usually just picked something that sounded challenging and went with it. The added variety was nice. \n\n* Prowler: I pushed the Prowler 10 times for 50 yards with 60 seconds rest in between. I started off at 50%ish bodyweight then added a plate (45 lbs) every 3 weeks. This was really hard. By the 10th push, I was really struggling, especially as the weeks went on.   \n* Air Dyne Bike: I underestimated the Air Dyne Bike. Riding this thing for 10 miles at a decent pace will really make you feel it. I found the first half to be hard enough but by mile 10, my lungs, arms, and legs were all crying out for mercy. I tried to improve my time from week to week.  \n\n**Cardio:**  \nA few months before choosing to run these BtM blocks, I got sort of addicted to running more often. Why, I don't know. But I didn't want to stop running, so I made the decision to add some runs throughout the week. I also walked 2 miles each day on weekdays after I ate lunch.   \n\n**Diet:**  \nWendler says you have to eat big on this program and he wasn't kidding. No matter how much I ate, I felt like it wasn't enough. As I'm a grown man who knows how to cook so I didn't follow his diet recommendations. But below is a sample of what my daily diet looked like (I didn't track calories or measure anything):  \n  \n* Breakfast: 6 eggs scrambled with 1 tablespoon of butter, spinach, peppers, and parmesan cheese, 2 bowls of cereal (I'm partial to Fairlife's lactose free milk and the organic Kashi cereal), 1 banana, 2 mugs of black coffee \n* Mid-morning snack: 1 apple with peanut butter  \n* Lunch: One-pot recipe usually with some type of meat, rice, and veggies, then some carrots and an avocado on the side  \n* Mid-afternoon snack: Bagel with peanut butter  \n* Dinner: One-pot recipe again with meat\/veggies and some form of carb. I like one-pot cooking as it's easy on time and cleaning up.  \n* Dessert: Cottage cheese with honey, fruit, and granola     \n  \nEdit: Here's an example of a one-pot meal. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FP6E3JtmsCE&t=6s\n  \nI had carbs in there but mostly I tried to ensure my diet was based around healthy fats and protein. I don't drink a lot of alcohol; maybe 2 drinks a month or so even then it's just a light beer or a cocktail.  \n\nSupplements are 5g of creatine, and then some fish oil and vitamin D \n\n**Results and Progress Made:**  \n\nThe lifts are the TM's I used. The weights are in lbs. The 5k\/10k times are estimated and rounded up. \n\nItem| Start | Finish\n---|---|----\nWeight | 187  | 195 \nDeadlift | 410 | 440\nSquat | 315 | 345\nBench | 260 | 275\nOHP | 150 | 165\nDips | 20x10 | 10x20\nChins | 10x10 | 10x10\nProwler | 170 | 305\nAir Dyne | 30:05 | 25:36   \n5k | 24:00 | 22:30  \n10k | 48:00 | 47:00\n\n**Some thoughts:**  \n  \n* I set out to make progress on my conditioning and I feel like I was successful. My work capacity is probably higher than it's ever been in my life and my hard work has paid off. I'm quite happy about that. \n  \n* I should've eaten more. I'm feeling it right now as I type this. \n\n* I'm quite pleased with my progress on dips! I was happy that I cut the number of sets in half in 12 weeks to reach the 200 total.   \n\n* I think I've capped myself on that Air Dyne 10 mile time. The 25:36 time had me damn near pass out by the end of it. \n  \n**Conclusion:**   \n\nI don't know if I can recommend running 2 cycles of BtM back to back. It was really, really hard and often times miserable. But if you want to give it a go, I strongly recommend you learn from my mistake and eat bigger with each 3-week block. \n\nAs for what now, I'm deloading this week. The conditioning will be light to moderate, the runs will be at a slower pace, and I'm probably not going to lift anything. Frankly my joints are telling me they need a break. I haven't decided what program I'm going to run next, but it certainly won't be as intense as BtM.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676215426.0},{"title":"February 12 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/1107kvw\/february_12_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676178068.0},{"title":"Jacked Guys MUST Know A Lot About Building Muscle","author":"GigaChan450","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/pfIevsMBe74","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676052960.0},{"title":"February 11 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10zcq8t\/february_11_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676091670.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10ynndp\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676023268.0},{"title":"February 10 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10ygro2\/february_10_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676005270.0},{"title":"SANDBAG EXERCISE DIRECTORY 4: Sandbag NALA Rolls, Get Ups & Split Squats","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ousWffFWnKQ","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675982191.0},{"title":"How Many Rest Days Do You Need in a Week?

So like and subscribe and stuff. Or don't. I won't force my Only Fro's down your throat.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ijgQUJSBBMo&list=PLzhs7nkkyZS2kGmmoUr1mE73kD53NzbXV)\n\n**What is 531 and what is this template?:**\n\n[https:\/\/www.jimwendler.com\/blogs\/jimwendler-com\/101082438-boring-but-big-and-really-sore](https:\/\/www.jimwendler.com\/blogs\/jimwendler-com\/101082438-boring-but-big-and-really-sore)\n\nThe one and only online review of the program. At least I couldn't find any other reviews. I'm probably the first dummy to run it. And oh boy did it live up to it's name!\n\nSo I won't go into basic 531 more than this.\n\nYou have a lighter week, a slightly heavier week, and then a heavy week, but everything is pretty much submaximal work. You then have 5 more sets that are lighter than the heavy sets to get extra volume in.\n\nMost of you are probably familiar with the 531 Boring But Big. You do your 3 main sets, then do a 5x10 of what is usually 50% of your training max.\n\nThis template is just like that, except for you don't ever change the weight of the 5x10's as you progress cycle to cycle. Instead, you increase the reps from 5x10 (cycle 1), to 5x12 (cycle 2), to 5x15 (cycle 3), to 5x20 (cycle 4).\n\n(my weights used for these sets... OHP 110, Deadlift 250, Front Squat 175, Bench Press 175)\n\nThe regular 531 sets progress as normal, but the 5 supplemental sets stay the same weight during the entire 4 cycles.\n\nYou deload after the 5x12's week and then again after the 5x20's week. Meaning this will take 14 weeks worth to program. I absolutely needed the deloads.\n\nI ran the first cycle as 531, but remembered that I preferred running the templates as 351. Cycles 2 through 4 were all done as 351.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The rules that I broke:**\n\nJim says don't do more than the minimum on the last set. I often did do the minimum, but sometimes I took sets to failure or close to failure against recommendations. On deadlifts I almost always chased 10 reps on my last set. Bench I usually cut off at 5 reps. Squats I would leave a couple reps in reserve or stop at the minimum for the most part. OHP was a bit different, I started with using my push press TM because I thought I would want to continue doing my main sets as push press. I quickly grew the desire to grow my strict press again so I switched over to strict. The thing was I never reset my TM so I was still using a TM 20 pounds heavier than it should have been. That being said, it made me really good at strict press again and towards the end of the programming I was getting more than the minimum reps.\n\nJim says only use this on squats and think about getting rid of deadlifts all together when running this. I decided to send it and do it for all of the lifts. 5x20 deads, ohp, bench, and squats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goals for this program:**\n\n* Earn mental toughness (5x15's and 5x20's will do that to you)\n* Create a good work capacity for higher rep events\n* Gain some mass and put the extra calories to work\n* Put myself in a position to have additional muscle mass when I cut back down to below 200\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Body weight progression:**\n\nApproximately 210 pounds. I was technically lighter, but I had just gotten over a water cut to compete in a strongman comp so I knew that number was skewed down a bit. I ended the program weighing 223 pounds. A little short of my 225 goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Best lifts during this time frame\/PR's:**\n\n(Note, this template wasn't designed with the goal of increasing my one rep maxes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bench:**\n\n* 340 x 5\n\n**OHP: (Strict)**\n\n* 250 x 2\n* 240 x 4\n* 230 x 5\n* 275 (Log clean and push press)\n\n**Squat:**\n\n* 515 x 1 (PR)\n\n**Deadlift:**\n\n* 495 x 10\n* 250 x 42\n* 565 x 1 (PR)\n* 570 x 1 (PR)\n\n**Zercher Squat:**\n\n* 455 x 1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lessons learned:**\n\nI made the mistake of adding way too much volume at the beginning in terms of accessories and conditioning. I slowly widdled it down and got to a really good place that I was happy with. (See accessory section for final selection of accessories)\n\nThere was a reason Jim didn't recommend it for all of the lifts at once. My back was frequently pumped, but got really use to the volume after the 5x15's. I frequently had neck tweaks and upper back tweaks from OHP. I knew this, but I wanted to push myself nonetheless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* Bench Day - Dips: Body weight\/High volume in a little amount of time, Pullup progression, facepulls\/band pull aparts, core work\n* Squat Day - Pull up progression, core work, assault bike (or similar)\n* OHP Day - Dips: Body weight\/High volume in a little amount of time, Pullup progression, facepulls\/band pull aparts, core work\n* Deadlift Day: Pull up progression, core work, assualt bike (or similar)\n* Other: lots of sled pushing\/pulling and keg carrying along with a lot of different sandbag workouts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Event Day:**\n\nI volunteer at strongman gym on Saturdays closing up shop. In return I don't have to pay for my membership there. It's also a four hour shift so I have a lot of time to do some hard work, get a decent rest time in and go to the next event. The competition that I was training for has a yoke, axle deadlift, a log, frame carry, and duckwalk\/power stairs. I had access to all of these and the actual comp weights weren't too taxing so I frequently did comp weight for all or many of the events every Saturday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a commons Saturday may look like:\n\n* Log for 4 sets\n* Yoke Run\n* Light Frame Carrying for speed\n* Axle deadlift for reps in 30-40 seconds (instead of the full 60)\n* core\n* Assault bike\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor an alternate day may look like\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Log for 4 sets\n* Heavy Frame Pick and holds\n* Light yoke runs for speed\n* Duck Walk or Power Stairs\n* lower back\n* sled work\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis program sucked. It was difficult and I barely felt like I was going to survive. This is why I think it's one of, if not the best weight gaining programs I've ever followed. I am stronger for pushing this program the way that I did. It was worth all of the pain and discomfort. Every squat and deadlift day felt like an absolute nightmare. I hated the idea of getting underneath the bar for 20 reps of squat and then having to do it all over again 4 more times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the 5x20 weeks I couldn't stop eating. I'd be hungry and eating in between sets. I'd be eating 2-3 times after dinner. I'd be eating a huge breakfast upon waking up and still feel like it wasn't enough. Equally I felt like I could never drink enough water even though I was drinking at least a gallon a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe upper body pumps were like no other. Every time I did presses\/dips my chest, shoulders, and triceps felt extremely swollen.  Every time I did pull ups my biceps were painfully pumped. My upper and lower back never felt 100% recovered. Once I got to the 5x20 weeks I could get the first 2 upper body sets to 20 reps, but then it turned into getting the remaining 60 reps in any way possible. Sets of 10 with 30 seconds rest, sets of 5, etc..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe lower back pumps equaled some of the worst that I've ever had. (From when I ran the 10x10 in deep water) I was literally terrified to get back underneath the bar and squat for 20 more reps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not think you would be successful with this program unless you were extremely committed to eating yourself to death, feeling tired and fatigued the majority of the time, and would have to get over the feeling of hating the idea of going back into the gym. This is what bulking should feel like. It's harder than cutting if you train the right way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nCustom programming to focus on strength while I lose weight and work on strongman specific events for upcoming competitions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's now coaching season so my 4+1 event day has turned into 3+1 event day along with some additional running. (Since I run with the kids at practice)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy overall goal is to place better at nationals this year. I was 11th last year, I'd like to perform better than that even if it's by one placing. I also want to reach the top 10 at static monsters. My first year I was in the 30's, this last year I was number 17 in the world. Top 10 gets invited to the world championships and I want that experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is going to be my last year under 200. I want to bulk 20 pounds, cut 10, and repeat until I'm about 300 pounds. I would love to take a real shot with the big boys. Even though I know that'll take years to accomplish, it gives me something long term to look forward to. Should hit a PR or 2 on the way as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n200 --> 220 --> 210 --> 230 --> 220 --> 240 --> 230 --> 250, etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Worse case scenario I fall short and start being competitive in the 231 weight class.*","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675718779.0},{"title":"February 7 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10vt7rc\/february_7_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675746069.0},{"title":"CORRECTIVE EXERCISES for KNEE & HIP PAIN!!

Thanks to Stronger by Science team I no longer fear the interference effect and neither should you.\n\n\nI started performing and exploring \"cardio\" last March after realizing I was \u201cvery strong\u201d for your average 32-year-old at 255lbs 450\/300\/445 but A.) sucked wind for anything of meaningful duration B.) realized if I wanted to progress my strength further I need to become a complete athlete and you know actually do athlete things like build my cardiovascular system up.  After Greg and Trex quelled my fears of cardio I took to a new commercial gym that had a 20 yard strip of turf and fun cardio toys: battles ropes, prowlers, kettlebells, carries, etc.  I spent a few weeks playing around and figured out my jam and now I have a roledex of fun cardio-esque modalities I can choose from depending on the session, how i\u2019m feeling and my time constraints.\n\n* Battle Ropes -\nI first played with Battles Ropes and came to the conclusion that they are fun for short bursts, but should be a filler exercise in my opinion.  I found them to be boring and not personally engaging in a very similar way to jogging which I do in fact hate; give me a bike to meaningfully cover distances or let me sprint. I tried Battle Ropes for long durations because of the supposed creator 'John Brookfield' claimed he used them for long durations to great benefit of his athletes but I cannot find proof or testimonials to this end. Here is his site. If anyone knows more please guide me! I'm open to exploring them again in the future. To be fair, Battle Ropes made me realize how slamming a rope\/chain\/thread that is tied off to something could be used to give an intense cardiovascular workout in a very small space with very minimal equipment. Maybe you want to be Bane, I don't know but you could make them work in very small spaces for cheap.\n\n* Prowler\/sled -\nNext I moved onto the prowler\/sled with the intention of using it to perform some LSD\/aerobic work.  I set the bar low to start off and decided I would just push, pull, drag the sled for time, I didn't care about the load moved, I just cared to keep my hands stayed on the uprights and my feet kept the thing moving for the next 20 minutes.  I then added 5 minutes a session until I capped out at 45 minutes after 6 weeks. However, as I went into a strength peaking phase I need to cut down on the long-duration pushes\/drags because I was not willing to be in the gym for 3 hours. So I had to get creative and figure out how to fit the sled into my programming because it was the first cardio tool I fell in love with enough to actually use. So I divided the sled into two easy interventions based on how I'm feeling: Sprints in 10 minutes and Continuous work for time.\n\n* Kettlebells - \nI had a previous history with Kettlebells due to a back injury in college and was familiar with the swing, snatch, clean and Turkish Get-Up but I left them behind the moment I could touch a barbell again and feel no back pain. Kettlebell swings are great and can be done very heavy which I like, like 100+lbs but I don't think they should be done overly fatigued as the rep quality quickly drops off in my experience.  Previously I went off the rough estimate that 100 swings is equivalent to a mile jog in terms of physiological response, I don\u2019t know if that's true but it provided a framework to build off of for programming.   I really like swings for hamstring work as well as my gym does not have a GHR.\nAnyway around this time last March I was really digging into Physical Culture history and came to learn of strongman [Hermann Goerner](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hermann_G%C3%B6rner) who performed records that would still be respectable today and found a golden tidbit from his training that he referred to as \u2018Die Kettle\u2019 or \u2018The Chain\u2019 and he used them to warm up prior to dumbbell or barbell work. \u2018Die Kettle' has you set up a chain of kettlebells of increasing loads, you snatch the bell overhead then you perform a press then lastly a clean and press and move onto the other arm then you move on to the next heavier bell working you way up \u2018The Chain\u2019. I found this to be a great warm-up for all upper body lifts and power cleans and it only takes 5 to 8 minutes max to run through 32,45,55,70lbs kettlebells with each arm. Sadly all the adjustable KBs on the market are unitaskers at best, so instead of increasing load i\u2019m going to see how putting fat grips on the horns works or i\u2019ll move onto to performing the chain with both arms.\n\n* Hand Over Hand Rope Pulls - \nAfter 6 weeks of playing with the sled and kettlebells, I noticed next to the useless Battle Rope was a 2\u201d rope that could attach to a sled and inspired by [Kyriakos Grizzly](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jvMizmyem1Q) I started performing heavy-ass rope pulls and fell in love once more. I never found rows of any kind to offer any meaningful reward given their time cost and reasoned a rope pull is more similar than not to a row so maybe rope pulls offer some value to maintaining shoulder health as well and oh boy have they been a hidden godsend. I linearly progressed my rope pulls from 70lbs(not including the weight of the sled which is 70lbs) hand over hand for 20 yards for eight rounds to 185lbs for five rounds (I should hit 200lbs later this month).  Sure I expected some grip benefits because of the rope diameter and can now hold onto any lift with ease, but the big secret sauce is how they benefitted my chin-up\/pull-up game as a large man who could barely do two reps. I went from barely doing 2 reps to comfortably being able to hit sets of three which allowed me then hit sets of four and five reps now at 245lbs, my upper back now has the endurance to last and I solely credit the rope pulls for this.  If you\u2019re a big guy or gale and want to do more chin-ups find a rope to pull some weight! Furthermore, they do not make you sore but will give you the sickest forearm\/grip pump without posing any risk of injury (I have gotten some pinky flexor junk from not fully wrapping my hand around the rope which was easily addressed by grabbing deeply and fully with my hand before curling-pulling the rope back). \n\n* Carries - \nMost recently Farmers Carries, I bought a small pair of loadable handles that cap out at 330lbs per hand because lifting 100lbs dumbbells won't do jack for my grip given my strength and the trap bar is too wide and cumbersome for the strip of turf available to me.  I load them up moderately heavy (185+ per hand) and walk for 40 yards at a clip, rest, and repeat OR do some other filler in between like bear crawls or sled pushes for rounds. Some days I go heavy for short distances or moderate loads for more yardage. Going to really push these after my meet in March and will also be getting a sandbag for front carries, but all my conditioning work is at maintenance until my meet, then I\u2019m going to really play with cranking the dial up going into summer.\n\n\n\n**Programming - How I used these modalities in my upper-lower split:**\n\n\n* Volume Lower - Continuous sled pushes, drags, backward, and lateral trots for time, keep the load low to moderate as the goal is time or the number of trips. Currently, I program for X trips in Y time and if I hit X trips before Y time I make note of it and aim to keep that standard OR I don't hit the same number of trips but still go on for the full scheduled duration. I do these on lower body intensive days as the exercise doesn't require much power or pop, just the will to grind on and keep moving. It's also done on days I'm mentally or physically dragging and feel too tired to sprint or do anything else more intensive.  I steadily do these two days a week.\n\n\n* Volume Upper - Sprints in 10 minutes, load the sled up to 140lbs (without the weight of the sled) and see how many reps you get in 10 minutes. Once you hit ten reps over two or three sessions, increase the time and aim for 15 in 15, etc. Don't go too heavy as these should still be sprints. I found placing them on upper body volume days allows me to keep speed and power without my legs feeling like dead weights. You won't always PR nor should you aim to, sometimes set the bar low, step over it and when you feel you can hit more then do so. To govern my monkee brain I only aim for one more rep if I hit the same number of reps over two or three sessions. So if over several sessions I hit 8 sprints, 8 sprints, then maybe i'll go for 9\/10 or maybe i'll aim for 8 and increase the goal the following session.  I picked up this idea from [Matt Reynolds\u2019 old Death by Prowler Article for Staring Strength before he split off and created Barbell Logic](https:\/\/startingstrength.com\/article\/death_by_prowler) as the idiot proof way to prowler sprint effectively. When 10 sprints can be done consistently, increase the time to 15 minutes and aim for 15 sprints eventually ad infinum or increase the load or density of sprints.\n\n\n* OFF\n\n\n* Intensity Lower - Standing Rope Pulls baby! Too heavy and it becomes a full-body movement requiring your legs and becomes some kind of heave which I\u2019m not intending. So I try to stick with moderately heavy for 20 yards, hand over hand, and aim to move my hands as fast as possible to keep up the momentum of the sled moving. I also aim to get full retraction on the pull as you do with a one-arm row. You can go \"heavy\" for a few rounds 5-6 or a bit lighter for 8-10. When resting between rounds some days I perform basic gymnastic trots: jog forwards\/backwards, carioca\/grapevine OR some ab work like rolling planks. This should only take you 15 minutes or less.  Sometimes I follow these with an additional series of Continuous sled pushes, drags, backward, and lateral trots for time depending on how I feel.\n\n\n* Intensity Upper - Carry and crawls, aiming to burn out my grip going as heavy as possible over 40 yards for 10 rounds. Set the handles down then do something else, recently I'm exploring bear crawls with the intention of progressing to slider seal crawls (aka a moving plank).  This should only take you 15 minutes or less. Sometimes I follow these with an additional series of Continuous sled pushes, drags, backward, and lateral trots for time depending on how I feel.\n\n\nTLDR; Do sled stuff, push it one way for some distance then figure out something else to do or push it back to where you started and do that for 15-45 minutes. If you have a rope attached it to the sled and pull it. But find some modality you find acceptable or love and keep at it!","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675641134.0},{"title":"Gainit Program Party: Super Squats Week Five","author":"richardest","url":"\/r\/gainit\/comments\/10v57s3\/gainit_program_party_super_squats_week_five\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1675685979.0},{"title":"February 6 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10uy5ze\/february_6_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675659670.0},{"title":"[Program Review] Building the Monolith - Coldgrasp Edition","author":"ColdGrasp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10ueg5k\/program_review_building_the_monolith_coldgrasp\/","text":"**TL;DR:** Ran at least 30 minutes every \"rest\" day, did conditioning after every workout, and opted for one hard conditioning per week. This results in a program that will build a well-conditioned monolith. I gained 4-5ish pounds eating 3.5k calories.\n\nHello r\/weightroom.  I just finished BtM and I think anyone who is having trouble gaining should try this 6-day program. I have gone ahead and split this into sections, but I know a lot of people just care about progress photos so here ya go:\n\nBefore: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jfKkY8j](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jfKkY8j)\n\nAfter: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/RjLaZ31](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/RjLaZ31)\n\n**Prior Training\/Backstory**:\n\nI did PHAT in the first part of my lifting career which was absolutely crap for me. Did not progress at all. Next, I did nSuns for a while and that really helped me get some good numbers, but I did it for too long resulting in just burnout. Next up was Super Squats which was my favorite program until this one. I started out at 100bs BW (Check out my r\/gainit progress post for more information on my background) and have gained a significant amount since then.\n\nMy numbers running BtM:\n\nSquat: 260\n\nDeadlift: 315\n\nOHP: 120\n\nBench Press: 185\n\nNOTE: I have not tested my new 1RMs. I probably won't. This isn't a PR program but a size one. I feel like my photos show that this program works.\n\n**What is Building the Monolith?**\n\nBtM is from the creator of 5\/3\/1, Jim Wendler, and the program is found here: [https:\/\/www.jimwendler.com\/blogs\/jimwendler-com\/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size](https:\/\/www.jimwendler.com\/blogs\/jimwendler-com\/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size)\n\nMake no mistake, this is a 6-day program. A lot of people just see that you are lifting three times per week and just assume it's a 3-day program. This is wrong. You must do conditioning. You cannot fall behind. If you do, then you need to play catchup. Make time for this program. For the next 6 weeks, your only priority should be on this program.\n\n**Modifications I made to BtM:**\n\nAs I mentioned above, I had zero rest days. I just don't think they are needed at all no matter what program you are doing (NOTE: I am not saying you should lift heavy every day). I ran 30 minutes in between lifting days and added a 5-minute Tabata sprint after the run. I also added daily work on these days which is 100 pushups, 50 pullups, 150 air squats. This is just to get my blood flowing to my muscles. Another modification was the additional work I added. After every lifting session I added a 10 minute to 30-minute conditioning workout. This was hard and I did not want to do it, but I wanted the results more than anything, so I did it anyway. Finally, I did a hard conditioning workout once per week and this fucked me up. I hated these with every fiber of my being. The hardest one I did was a blackjack WoD with Kettlebell Swings and Back Squat (135lbs) AFTER I had done my widowmaker set. Another one is the Buddy 6 WoD. Did this solo and it was terrible. I would not make these modifications if you're not willing to eat 24\/7.\n\nI plan to do Buddy 10 in the future :)\n\n**DIET:**\n\nAgain, I was eating 3.5k calories as a 5'8 man who isn't even above 160lbs. I ate constantly. It got to the point where I would demolish PB&J sandwiches in my college classes. To mimic Jim Wendler's diet, I bought a whole chicken every 3-4 days and ate all of it. Including skin. I found the macros here lined up with the diet recommendations from Wendler. It was also super cheap so do not neglect whole chickens. Carbs were rice and oats. Protein was chicken, tuna, cottage cheese, and protein powder. Fats were mixed nuts and nut butter. I ate two bags of frozen veggies a day and had at least one whole fruit per day. This is healthy. Please do this.\n\n**What I did wrong:**\n\nI drank a lot of alcohol, and I did not get enough sleep on some days. No one else to blame but me. I go to a college with a rich party history, and I partied. I would say that was the only thing I really did wrong during this program.\n\n**Additional Thoughts**:\n\nLook this program is going to beat your ass. I recommend supersetting everything you can. I ended up finishing most days in under 45 minutes which left plenty of time for conditioning. Do not forget that this is a 6-day program. If you treat it like a 3-day program, then just do a different program. Follow the diet or something remarkably close to it. The dips are tremendous here and I loved doing them. I ended up doing 100 BW and 100 weighted dips at the end. Chin-ups exploded my back, and I can easily do them in sets of 10. I also added weight to my chin-ups. I recommend that you do not do that at the beginning of this program.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGonna take a well-deserved deload and run Beefcake but with more hypertrophic accessories after the 5x10 exercises. I am also going to lower my workload and calories just because it is expensive to be eating 3.5k calories. If you have any questions, please do not be afraid to ask.\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite subreddit. Yall are amazing.

Indeed, it is very hard to become overtrained (getting overtraining syndrome). It mostly happens to elite athletes. It is rare in strength training and bodybuilding [1] [7].\n\nHowever, saying overtraining does not exist, is an exaggeration. Many scientific studies describe overtraining syndrome in athletes [1] [4] [5] [6] [7] [9]. Estimates suggest 20% to 60% of athletes may become overtrained at some point in their career [4]. \n\n###**What overtraining is**\n\nOvertraining (aka overtraining syndrome) is when you\u2019ve pushed your body too hard for too long [1] [4] [5] [6] [7] [9].\n\nIn practice, you experience a drop in physical performance and fatigue [4] [7] [9] [11].\n\n**There are two things that lead to overtraining:**\n\n1. Excessive exercise: for example, intense training every day [7].\n\n2. Under recovery: not enough food, water, physical rest, mental rest and sleep [7] [9].\n\nYou need to do both of these for months, maybe years, until overtraining develops.\n\nIn other words, overtraining is all about balance, or the lack of it.\n\n###**Under recovery, not just over training**\n\nWhile it may seem contradictory, overtraining doesn\u2019t have to come exclusively from excessive exercise.\n\nUnder recovery  means eating, sleeping or resting too little. It also includes mental stress.\n\nSo if you do not recover properly, you may end up \"under recovered\".\n\n###**Will I become overtrained?**\n\nIn \/r\/fitness, I would say the chance is 0. The level of intensity in \/r\/weightroom is much higher, and many people here are pushing limits.\n\nStill, the risk of real overtraining is low. You are more likely to become overreached or non-functionally overreached. The symptoms during overreaching are actually the same as during overtraining: fatigue, drop in performance, and so on.\n\nThe ones who are at a real risk of overtraining, are elite athletes. It could happen to a normal person, but that person would have to train daily, intensively, for months and years.\n\n###**Conclusion**\n\nIf you recover with 4 weeks of rest, you are overreaching. If you are still not recovered at the 4 week mark, you may be overtrained.\n\n[Source - full article](https:\/\/sci-fit.net\/overtraining-myths\/)\n\n###**References**\n\n1.

My bad.\n\n**Intro**\n\nCurrently a 27 yo male, 5 foot 6, 158 lbs. But lets start in the past. I started weight training mostly for body building at like 16 and then got really into powerlifting between 18-22. I ran mostly Sheiko style stuff with some 5 3 1, some self created plans etc. Was my strongest at 22 years old around 168 lbs. My squat was 375 for a 3RM, bench was 260 for a 1RM, and DL was 515 for a 1RM. But then I messed my back up somehow. I remember waking up the day after a lightish squat session and my lower back felt a little funky. Didn't worry too much about it and went to the gym to deadlift. But on an easy warm up at 225, I basically heard my disc slip. To keep it short, I stopped lifting for years. I recovered within a year or so (I mean, it wasn't that bad, but I occasionally noticed twinges until a year went by) but I was very down because I lost so much strength.\n\nBut, January or February of 2022 I decided to start lifting again! Yes, I could barely bench a plate, barely squat 185, and I didn't even dare touch deadlift. But I went back in just doing general bodybuilding stuff to get back into it. Progress came quickly and I was able to bench over 200 and squat around 250 pretty easily after maybe 6-8 months of 3x per week. And then I decided I should get back into my passion, powerlifting. But I was still scared to dead.\n\nSo I did my own training for a couple months which took me right into the beginning of 2023 and tested my maxes. And I decided to say fuck it and try to deadlift as well. Squat was 315, Bench was 240, DL (without any training for 5 years) was 335. So that's where I stood before deciding to try the Nuckols Program.\n\n**The Program**\n\nY'all know the program, I won't explain it to you all. But what I did with it was run the 3x Intermediate (Medium Volume) Bench, 3x IntAdv Squat, and 1x Intermediate DL (though, with the deadlift I also did the accessory work sans Sumo that is in the Advanced version). On top of this, I added at least one or two extra pull movements on each day (pull ups, lat pulls, face pulls, rear delts, BOR). I did it 4x a week with Tuesday being Bench and Squat, Thursday Bench and Squat, Saturday Bench and DL, and Sunday Squat.\n\n**Results and Thoughts on the Workout**\n\nDeadlifts went very well. The workouts felt difficult and I ended up hitting 365 on max day. It was a tiny grind at the bottom, but locking it out was very fast. The only thing I wasn't huge on was the third week almost felt too easy since it was a deload. This left it feeling like I really only got two good workouts through the whole cycle before maxing. But hey, 30 lbs isn't bad. The EMOM stuff was interesting and I almost wonder how much that helped.\n\nSquat also went well. I ended up doing a 3RM of 315 and it honestly felt like I had at least 1 more, maybe even 2, in the tank. The low bar days were rough, especially the 10 RM and 8RM days. I'm not sure if I like how that was laid out because I really prefer just being given numbers. And on top of that, the 10 and 8 in the calculator seemed wayyy harder than the 5 in the calc. Front squats were good. I mean I hate them, but they went well. And the high bar pause were a nice, semi-challenging way to incorporate a safe third day.\n\nBench is where I shocked myself. No fucking clue how this happened. Week 1 I hit 190 for 9 which meant I could increase my max 5 lbs. Keep 190x9 in mind. Week 2 I hit 195 for 10, another added 5 pounds, nice. Week 3 I barely hit 200 for 9, but that's still another 5 lbs. But here's where it went crazy. Today's session, at 215, I hit 8 reps. I thought I would barely get 4 out and I killed the 8 (even though the 8th was a massive grind). Nonetheless, that puts me at about 265 max which is more than I've ever done before. So that was a major confidence boost. Overall, I loved the bench workouts the most out of the three. It felt the most useful and the most well thought out. I'm curious if there's a similar way to do these types of workouts for the squat.\n\n**Questions**\n\nSince I've only been training deads again for 4 weeks, I'll leave things as is despite my complaint about week 3.\n\nFor Squat though, I really don't like front squats lol. And I honestly feel like another low bar session would better benefit me... Do you guys have any suggestions for swapping the FS out with a different LB session? And how would I tackle that? Or would this be a bad idea.\n\nFor bench. Idk. Clearly I think this program works for me, because I feel stronger on bench than I ever did back in the day when I powerlifted for 4 years, so I'm for sure sticking with this one for now!\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nSquat: 315x1 --> 315x3\n\nBench: 240x1 --> 215x8 (\\~260\/265 est.)\n\nDeadlift: 335x1 --> 365x1\n\nBodyweight remained relatively similar. Started at 156 and ended at 158, but it seems like normal fluctuation.\n\nThanks for reading! Feel free to provide tips or ask any other questions for clarification.\n\nEdit: Should add that my injury came from me doing self-programming and pushing myself with way too much intensity...\n\nEdit 2: Maxes at 22 were all belted with decent weightlifting shoes. Maxes today were all beltless with Brooke\u2019s running shoes (yes I really need new shoes lol).","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674963510.0},{"title":"January 29 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10nzfrz\/january_29_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674968468.0},{"title":"SANDBAG EXERCISE DIRECTORY 1: Sandbag Pick, Extensions & Loads","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Uwrtyw7gpTU","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674920315.0},{"title":"[Program Reviews] 531 The Morning Star and The Armstrong Pullup Program, run by a rank novice.","author":"Eubeen_Hadd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10nf5ni\/program_reviews_531_the_morning_star_and_the\/","text":"History\n\n27 yo male, 5'10\u201d, 183 lbs at the start of the program. \n\nThrough high school, I was a cross country and distance track runner, weighing in at about 145 lbs at my heaviest, and with programless lifting I managed a pr of 345lb high handle trap bar deadlift, and also gave myself an inguinal hernia. Oops. College rolled around, I stopped running and lifting and fattened up to 190 on zero exercise and 100% Ben and Jerry's Half Baked. I lived sedentarily like this til 25, started intermittent exercise in the form of rucking, occasional running, and Tactical Barbell SE work. \n\nI also ran Super Squats. \n\nBetween super squats and now I've been juggling my running and pullups, but wanted to return to 531 proper for some gpp. I did so and hurt my knee. Whoops. \n\nWhat I wanted:\n\nMy primary goals were to lay some groundwork for an ego lift with the clean and press, bump my pullups, add some pushups to my total, rehab my knee that started locking up on runs, and develop whole back pulling power. I did not want to gain or lose weight to avoid having to cut lots or stunt my healing, so I could return to 5k training and general PFT prep. \n\nThe Program\n\nWendler wrote a 531 Forever program for a guy who wanted to clean, press, and squat a lot. Naturally, like all programs in 531 Forever, it includes daily push, pull, and single leg\/core work, plus jumps and throws. He called this The Morning Star. I abbreviated it to 1 leader, 1 anchor from the written 2 leader, 1 anchor recommendation. This is the only template I know of that calls for reps at your TM which is cool. \n\nModifications\n\n\"No program survives first contact with a novice\" -Sun Tzu, probably\n\nI modified the program by adding the Armstrong Pullup Program to it! \n\nArmstrong is simple, available free online, and covers both the push and pull assistance required by Wendler, by requiring daily pullups and recommending daily pushups. \n\nBecause I wanted to add weighted pullups to the progression, I took the heavier 531 progression from 531 2nd edition and applied it to the pullups to replace day 5's \"do whatever was hardest\" recommendation. If you can strap ~40% of your body weight to you and do one pullup you can do this too. \n\nI did minimal core work, against the plan. \n\nI changed squats to front squats to build some upper back strength and front rack familiarity. \n\nPress became Axle Press because I was familiar with the movement and pressing an axle feels cool. All sets were taken from the floor. \n\nAll training maxes were set at 80%, instead of the recommended 90%, except for weighted pullups. \n\nThe program was run 351 instead of 531.\n\nI did no jumps or throws for lack of venue. \n\nConditioning was running, phased-in as my knee allowed. 2 weeks without running, 2 weeks with 1 run weekly, 2 weeks with 2 runs. Runs were a Tuesday speed work day and a Saturday long run. \n\nDiet\n\nMy diet was calorically uncontrolled, just going on what felt right. Here's a sample food day:\n\nMorning coffee with 2 scoops of protein powder\n\n.8-1.25 lbs of crock pot pork or beef for lunch\n\nOne large bag of steam-in-bag frozen veggies an hour or two later\n\nPeriworkout Gatorade, mixed from powder, 1L\n\nA bowl of Costco Tonkatsu ramen with 3-4 cage free eggs\n\nOccasionally, a large bowl of mini wheats with whole milk. I'm a sucker for it. \n\nResults\n\nAxle Press PR returned to 130lb e1RM, approximately 20 pounds lighter bodyweight than last time, approximately a 20 pound jump. Stoked\n\nOn my last day I set a 3@118lb barbell press PR, matching that e1RM despite having not pressed a barbell overhead for a max ever. Stoked\n\nPullups jumped from 11 to 13 overhand. Stoked\n\nPushups climbed from 20 to 40 without stopping. Nice\n\nMy final PR attempt at front squats saw me do 8@178lb, which is a big bump in e1RM over my previous best of 2@198 also set 20lb heavier. I had more in the tank for sure. Nice\n\nCleans went from a very messy 3@123 to a much less ugly 5@128, with much more confidence to clean the barbell for pressing now. Nice\n\nBodyweight grew to 185. Meh\n\nAesthetically I noticed the pulling and pressing gave me real aesthetic gains in my back and shoulders. Pullups build great lats. \n\nWhat I liked\n\nThe Morning Star is sweet. If you're the type of guy that hates doing the same lifts every day it's not for you, but I really enjoy that 3x weekly frequency. Because you're doing mainwork, 5x5's, and 10x5's every week in the leader you're getting lots of volume in, but it's all laid out manageably. The Anchor cycle sets you up to hit 9 successive PR's if all goes to plan. \n\nThe Armstrong Program delivers. I've never really done pushups with any serious effort so the gains there are nice, but the pullups are the purpose and they went up despite gaining a couple pounds. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\n\nMy choices of assistance (pushups and pullups only) meant I got little rowing in, and some kind of dip work would've been nice to balance all the pushing and pulling in other directions. You'll note that this is a me problem.\n\nCutting the second leader cycle meant lower TM's for my PR cycle and less volume accumulated, so there were definitely gains to be had there. Once again, me problem. \n\nWhat I'd do differently:\n\nI think next time I run this, it'll be with 3x weekly weighted pullups in line with Tactical Barbell Operator plus either dips or gorilla glute press as my equipment allows. Banging out a pullup ladder then going for speed work isn't fun, I'd rather divorce them, but results are results. \n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nThe Morning Star is sweet, and I'll run it again.\n\nArmstrong is sweet and I'm running it again after a deload week. \n\nMoving forward:\n\nI feel mostly ready for my next block which is clean and pressing every day, pullups every day, planks every day, and running\/rucking every day for PFT prep and weight loss. Hoping for a 250+ PFT, which 4-8 weeks of specific conditioning and weight loss should enable.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674912704.0},{"title":"Watch \"SANDBAG EXERCISE DIRECTORY 2: Sandbag Sprawls, Squats & Over the Shoulder\" on YouTube","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6iM8agPtC8E","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674920372.0},{"title":"January 28 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10n6pdl\/january_28_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674882070.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10mhay8\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674813670.0},{"title":"January 27 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10mco6d\/january_27_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674795669.0},{"title":"January 26 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10lk03m\/january_26_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674709271.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Chest (Aesthetics)","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10kx12e\/weakpoint_wednesday_chest_aesthetics\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

There are a few tips throughout about how certain aspects can be harnessed to build your own motivation and help you stick with things long term, but this is intended to provide background information that can be useful for understanding your own motivation. The most useful way that I can see this write-up being useful is for selecting which program you should run, but it can be applied to any aspect of behavior (changing diet, adding conditioning or mobility work, improving sleep, etc.). \\*Note that references to redditors are purely for example sake and may not represent their actual viewpoints\n\n**My Background**: I am an assistant professor of Kinesiology in the United States. I teach courses on the promotion of health related (mostly exercise) behaviors, and (part of) my research focuses on understanding how and why interventions work and how we can make them better. I am also a hobbyist strength athlete (my best gym total is 615\/390\/715 - 1720) who picked up running in response to COVID gym closures and progressed from \u201ca mile totally counts as long distance\u201d to multiple half marathons and 500 some miles run per year.\n\n**Introduction:** Exercise is a thing where consistency is more important than perfection. A year from now a suboptimal program done week in and week out will lead to better results than a perfect program done for a month. With that, ensuring that you are properly motivated to start and keep up for that year is a key prerequisite. We could get into the whole *motivation doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s about discipline* idea, but this is an overly simplified cop out and overlooks the idea that you still need to be motivated enough to exert that discipline. I can do a whole other write up on self-regulation (discipline), but one thing at a time here. This write-up is framed around motivation that is outlined in Self-Determination Theory, which is one of the most commonly used theories when analyzing exercise-related behaviors. Other theories might view motivation differently or might simplify it since it isn\u2019t a key aspect of explaining behavior, so keep this lens in mind. For example I touched on motivation in my high level overview of behavioral (link: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/pyo0ml\/behavior\\_for\\_dummies\\_background\\_and\\_tips\\_for\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/pyo0ml\/behavior_for_dummies_background_and_tips_for\/))  that I wrote like a year and a half ago, but this is intended to be a more detailed dive into just part of the process.\n\n**Basic Psychological Needs:** (Refresher from the last write up.) In SDT our motivation for behavior is based on our need to meet three separate basic psychological needs: Autonomy (a need to be in control of our own choices rather than being forced or coerced), Competence (a need to engage in behaviors we are good at\/or be good at the behaviors we engage in), and Relatedness (a need to feel connected or accepted in a group of similar individuals). The extent to which all three basic needs are met is important for determining if we will stick with a behavior long term. The other thing to keep in mind is that these needs being met is behavior specific, so just because you might have high motivation for one behavior (say, lifting) doesn\u2019t mean you have high motivation for related behaviors (e.g., stretching or cardio). This can also be even more specific within a behavior, where you can be motivated for some elements of a program but not others (e.g., you might love the way a program structures volume, but hate the idea of monitoring rest times). Conversely you might enjoy programming that revolves around a limited number of lifts that you are good at (like u\/dadliftsnruns programming deadlifts but not squats), or you may be motivated by doing a variety of lifts as a way of building your overall lifting competence. \n\n**Source of Motivation:**\n\nTo complicate things further, from a SDT perspective, motivation is a bit more complex than something that you have or don\u2019t have. It\u2019s also important to consider the source of that motivation. Broadly speaking motivation source can be split into controlled (external) and autonomous (internal, \"having autonomy\"), but it really is a continuum, and know that nobody is entirely motivated within one source. It's the relative amounts and balance that are more important\n\nControlled motivation\n\n* External regulation - being motivated by external factors. This is people that are motivated by tangible incentives (t-shirts, money, social media recognition etc.) or because other people say you should\/have to\n* Introjected regulation - being driven by some internal factors that are dependent on outside judgment. For example people that exercise because they feel shame about being overweight - the emotion is internal, but it's rooted in approval from others\n\nAutonomous motivation\n\n* Identified regulation - doing things because you recognize the benefits of it. Doing cardio even if you hate it because you know it's good for your heart or your weight loss. You want the benefits so you understand that you have to do the thing\n* Integrated regulation - the activity becomes part of your identity. u\/gzcl sees himself as someone who shows up day in and day out no matter what or u\/mythicalstrength sees himself as an exercise barbarian. For these people they don't have to be convinced to do something, it's just assumed because it's part of who they are.\n* Intrinsic motivation - doing something because you enjoy the activity itself. Even if it didn't give you benefits, you do something because you just enjoy doing it. For example, enjoying running for the sake of the run itself, not being concerned about the benefits to heart health or whatever. You can still recognize and want those benefits, but enjoyment is a key reason as well. This is the \u201cmultiple sources, relative weighting\u201d thing in action when it comes to answering the question *why do you run?*\n\nIf you are interested in understanding your own sources of motivation, there is a research survey that is commonly used called the BREQ-3 available at this link: [http:\/\/exercise-motivation.bangor.ac.uk\/breq\/breqdown.php](http:\/\/exercise-motivation.bangor.ac.uk\/breq\/breqdown.php), and a scoring guide available here: [http:\/\/exercise-motivation.bangor.ac.uk\/breq\/brqscore.php](http:\/\/exercise-motivation.bangor.ac.uk\/breq\/brqscore.php). (sorry, pdf and word versions only, I don\u2019t have a website that has this automatically scored for you)\n\nConventional understanding has said that autonomous motivation leads to better long term adherence than controlled motivation because those external factors are not necessarily permanent as tangible rewards and shame (or shaming people) may disappear, and if that also eliminates your motivation, the behavior ends. If you can become more autonomously motivated, then you are more likely to continue the behavior on your own. More recently there have been papers that show that a moderate level of external motivation helps support high levels of autonomous motivation, because it acts as another source of accountability. For example I have moderate to high amounts of autonomous motivation but low amounts of external motivation towards running, so when life gets busy I stop running. But I\u2019m still able to take the time to meal prep and track calories, because the external factors (shame in getting fat) forces me to prioritize. \n\n**Applying your newfound understanding**\n\nAdding a new behavior (or picking a new program or series of programs to stick with) are more likely to be successful if you support the three basic psychological needs, and properly build autonomous motivation (with appropriate underlying external motivation). How you do these things is an individual process, but I have a few strategies that you can try to get started.\n\n* Autonomy - The most important foundation, you have to WANT to be doing whatever it is that you\u2019re doing. This is kind of obvious, but questions like \u201cshould I cut or bulk\u201d almost always come down to *what do you want to do.* Cutting and bulking both suck if done properly, and if your body fat is high enough that the consensus is to cut, but you want to be stronger or have more muscle, you will be more successful if you bulk until you WANT to cut. The same thing applies to picking a program. Pick something that you want to try, and go do it. Begrudgingly doing a program like super squats is not going to go well if you\u2019re not bought into the process.\n* Competence - Start with where you are at and build from small successes. New behaviors can start from small changes and build. Start by just tracking calories, then start cutting calories out. Pick a program that you can successfully complete, not go from never working out to 2 hour a day workouts, 6 days a week. It\u2019s okay to not be good at things, but you should be able to improve with the program. Think starting running with couch to 5k, not jumping straight to an advanced marathon program with 15 mile runs in week 1\n* Relatedness - find people that are also interested in the same things. Maybe its the same program, maybe people that are cutting at the same time as you, maybe its just friends that you can talk about. Doing something as part of a larger group is one of the best ways to also develop the external motivation I mentioned earlier, because it offers a sort of accountability. Personally, I knew that I needed to put in the work to keep up with u\/dadliftsnruns when both of our deadlifts were blowing up, and that sense of competition and support got my ass to the gym on days that I really didn\u2019t want to. Also, this is why places like r\/weightroom are great for people that typically work out alone. Also, reply to each others workout logs, respond to or ask questions, generally be social. Not only does it help foster a better community, but it also makes you feel more included, and will help you stick with things when barriers come up. \n* Building Autonomous Motivation - Building autonomous motivation takes time, but try and focus on the positive aspects of why you do things that you do rather than view them as punishment. Thinking long-term (e.g., if I can cut successfully for a year\u2026, or doing cardio to prevent heart attacks in 30 years) is usually less beneficial because in the cost\/benefit tradeoff those positive outcomes are a long ways off, but getting up early sucks today. Instead try and recognize shorter term benefits. Tracking progress helps recognize weights moving easier or weight coming off. Even focusing on less concrete benefits like sleeping better or having a sense of pride and accomplishment in your workouts can help reinforce the why (seriously people, building a community that lifts each other up through positive reinforcement of PRs\/progress is one of the most effective ways to help beginners stick with it and intermediates do hard things). Even non-exercise related benefits can be enough to get the ball rolling (for me personally workout time is just as much about having time to myself blocked off where I don\u2019t have to work and I can just listen to music).\n   * Positive self talk\/affirmations \n\nAs I said at the top, motivation is a bit more complicated than just a have or have-not thing, and there are lots of reasons that you can be motivated to do something. Motivation doesn\u2019t automatically lead to success, but it\u2019s an important prerequisite, especially for hard things like diet and exercise. Whether its picking a program to stick with or adding a new facet to your training, understanding why you are even interested in the first place and having an understanding of where motivation comes from can hopefully help figure out why it may be lacking at times and address the shortcomings to be successful long term. Want to do something that you\u2019re already halfway decent at, but having a hard time with it? Try finding a friend (or many friends) to do it with to satisfy the need for relatedness and add some extrinsic motivation. Have friends and a goal in mind but it never lasts? Maybe start with small steps and build over time. \n\nI\u2019ll try and check back if there are any specific questions. I figure at some point I\u2019ll dive into the \u201cactually do it\u201d part of the equation from my high level overview, but if there are other topics that people are interested in diving into let me know.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674481763.0},{"title":"Contest Recap: Battle Axe Showdown, Garland TX 1\/21\/23","author":"not_strong","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10jhn62\/contest_recap_battle_axe_showdown_garland_tx_12123\/","text":"I completed in the Masters Male (40+) division at the 4th Annual Battle Axe Showdown this past weekend. It was a Strongman Corporation Regionals and Nationals qualifier. Battle Axe is a great strongman and powerlifting gym run by some nice folks who put on a great show. There were like 100 competitors across all divisions, there was a live stream, and there was a nice dog I got to pet.\n\nQuick background on me: I'm 42, I'm 5'7\" and 265 lbs., I've been training in one way or another since 1994, and I've competed in strongman since 2018.\n\nThere were 4 events at this show: axle clean and press for max reps in 1:00, deadlift ladder, truck pull, and sandbag\/yoke medley. I set up a 9 week training block with a one week deload for this show, and it was probably the hardest prep I've put myself through. The weather, the holidays, my job, and my baby daughter's sleep schedule all contributed, but the training was killer too. Axle clean and press is not a familiar movement for me, sandbags are my nemesis, and I've never pulled a truck. Nor do I have access to a truck to practice on. I consider deadlift to be my worst event, but I was actually pretty confident that the deadlift ladder would be my best event on the day.\n\nMy goals were to win an event, not zero an event, no injuries, and win the show. My goals for 2023 are to win an event (something I haven't done yet), win a contest (also something I haven't done), and compete at SC nationals (nope, never done it). If I won this show, I would be qualified for nationals, so I was amped to compete.\n\nThere were originally 4 guys in my division, but someone dropped out out, so it was just three of us. I signed up last, so I was up first on the axle press- clean each rep, 1:00 time limit, 245 pounds. I didn't know the guys I was competing with, and I didn't do any Instagram stalking to know what kind of numbers they would be chasing on the press, AAAND I wanted to prove to myself that I could kick some ass on this event, so the plan was to just go all out and get as many as possible. My adrenaline was cranked up to 11 before they called start, and I was yelling and shaking prior to. Got the go command and let it rip. In training, I had only gotten two reps in the minute, but it was a deliberate choice not to go 100% during training, as I didn't want to burn myself out. I figured I would be good for at least two, but didn't really know what was going to happen. Warm ups went fine, and the adrenaline could have gotten a rocket into orbit, so I was reasonably optimistic. First rep was nice and snappy. I got the down command, stepped back for a breath, and got the second rep no problem. At this point there was a little voice in my head telling me to just call it there. I don't know that voice and that voice is not my boss, so I went for a 3rd. Got the clean, and the press was no problem. Got the down command, stepped back for a breath. The announcer called 15 seconds left, and I decided very quickly that I would attempt a 4th rep. That friggin' voice told me not to waste my energy, because I probably didn't have time, but I ignored that voice, pushed the bar forward so I wouldn't fall off the platform, and went for the clean. One of the judges was yelling \"Hurry up!!!\" and the announcer was counting down the time on the mic, and normally these things would just shut me down, but I kept going. I pressed the 4th rep easily and got the down command right as time expired. 4 reps at the buzzer was pretty sweet. The other 2 competitors each got 2 reps, so 2023 goal for an event win achieved. I felt great after that.\n\nNext was deadlift ladder. As with any strongman contest, there was a lot of down time as they cycled through all the divisions, so I ate some snacks and made sure to stay hydrated. They set up the platforms for this to be head to head, but they called me first to do the event solo. I thought that was weird since I won the 1st event, but I guess they did it that way since the other guys tied the first event? I dunno. Anyhoo, the ladder was standard height power bar at 425 for one rep, then Texas deadlift bar at 455 for 2 reps, and then 13\" wagon wheel axle at 505 pounds for 3 reps, fastest time wins. I was all amped up again, ready to just kill this event. I think the adrenaline might have worked against me though, as I was so pumped up I forgot to pull my straps down off my forearms. My plan was to pull the first two bars with no straps, and then strap up on the axle. My intention was to have the straps at my wrists from the start, but when they asked if I was ready, I just yelled YEAH and got going. My straps were up near my elbows! Oops. I flew through the first two bars, absolutely no problem at all. I got to the axle and wasted nearly 10 seconds pulling my damn straps down over my forearm meat to my wrists. I pulled the 3 reps no problem, but the damage was done. The other two guys had no such lapses in concentration and I ended up in 3rd (last) place on this event. If I wouldn't have screwed around with my straps, I would have at least had 2nd, probably first.\n\nWaiting in line for the truck pull, I misread the scoring and thought I was still in 1st place. I reported that to my Instagram stories and later had to recant. That was a shitty piece of humble pie to have to choke down. But, when it was my division's turn for the truck, they called me first to pull. I thought that was weird, since I thought I was in the lead at the time, but I did not question it. The nice folks getting us into the harness and setting it up gave some really good instructions, and I got set to pull a semi truck for the first time in my life. I trained for this by pushing my SUV in my driveway with the parking brake engaged, and then rowing a dumbell non stop for 1 minute+. I don't have access to a truck, a big ass rope, a harness, or anything like that, so I just did what I could. The course was 25 or 30 feet, with a guide rope to pull with your hands. Again, I was all crazy with adrenaline and again it screwed me up. When they called go, I immediately started pumping my feet rather than getting that big pull to start with your feet together. I corrected myself and got the truck going at a good clip, but I wasted like 4 seconds. I finished the course and had to kick myself. The plan was always for the big initial pull, I just was not thinking. It's funny because I don't let myself get amped up like this when I train, but I was just a ball of adrenaline all day. Maybe too much pressure on myself to win? Maybe I just wanted to show off for the live stream? I don't know. In any case, I killed my chances at the contest win, because the other two guys were smart enough to pull the truck proper, and I ended up in last place again. Mathematically impossible to win the contest now.\n\nLast event was 3 sandbags to shoulder (200, 225, 250) into yoke (585 pounds for 25 or 30 feet). I was again going solo, and since I was in last place, I was up first. Sandbags are a struggle to me, and I trained this event really hard. Training went really well, especially in the last two or three weeks leading up to the show, but I knew it was going to be my toughest event. This being the last event of a 7 hour day to this point didn't help either. I got the go command and made it through the first 2 bags with no issue, just not as fast as I would have liked. I got the third bag to my shoulder and it immediately slid off to the back- but amazingly, I got the down command. I had a split second of OH SHIT and then grabbed the yoke and launched off the line. This was a mistake, as the weight got away from me and I dropped about midway down the course. Probably a bit of fatigue here as well, but I'm pretty sure that my strides were too long right off the start to control the weight. I have never dropped a yoke in competition, and I didn't drop it in any training leading up the show, so I was pretty disappointed in that. I crossed the line and cursed myself for yet another mental error.\n\nI ended up in 2nd place on that event, and 3rd place overall. So, technically a podium, but also technically last place on a show I was fully prepared to win. But, the positives were an event win (it being a press event win is a bonus because pressing is my favorite), no injuries, and I am qualified for regionals.\n\nI'm going to take some time to get a little less fat, address some shoulder, knee, and biceps uncoolness, take my family to Disneyworld, and then start on a 12 week prep for regionals.

My personal contribution, apart from adding to the [four existing reviews as of writing this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/search?q=rippler&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all), is to share my unique results as a novice stuck in a soft plateau coming off of COVID & back-to-back knee injuries, as well as how I tweaked the progression to take advantage of my shockingly fast (relative to the past months) progress.\n\n**Goal**\n\nMy *initial* goal for [The Rippler](https:\/\/swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com\/2016\/02\/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) was simple: maintain my meager strength that only recently came back after months of rehab work, while also trying to cut some weight before the holidays. Spoiler alert: the latter was a fat (heh) fail, but I noticed myself hitting incredible AMRAPs halfway in, so I course corrected.\n\nMy revised goal was much more ambitious given my soft plateau: hit an O\/B\/S\/D of 1\/1.5\/2\/3 plates. I was on track for this before COVID, but in order to hit this would mean making more progress in 6 weeks than I've made in the past **9 months**.\n\n**Results**\n\n* Biometrics: 30s\/M\/5'10\n* Program Duration: Nov '22-Jan '23 (12 Weeks)\n* Weight: 195->205lbs (oops for cutting)\n* Lifts (in kg):\n\nT1 Lift| PR (RM) | Before (e2RM) | After (2RM)\n---|---|----|----\n | **(e1RM)** |  | **(1RM)**\nSquat | 90x2 | 80x2 | 100x2\n | 95 | | 105 (+10)\nBench | 72.5x3| 72.5x2 | 80x2\n | 78 | | 85 (+7)\nDead | 120x2| 120x2 | 140x2\n | 126 | | 147.5 (+21.5)\nOHP | 42.5x8| 50x2 | 57.5x2\n | 53 | | 60 (+7)\n**SBD** | **299(e)** | | **337 (+38)**\n\nT2 (e5RM)| Before | After\n---|---|----\nFront Squat | 35 | 62.5 \nCGBP | 35 | 60 \nSLDL | 55 | 100 \nIncline Press | 35 | 57.5\n\n**Background**\n\nI first started lifting seriously in late 2020 with the r\/Ftiness Basic Beginner routine for 6 months. From there, I transitioned to GZCLP for almost 2 years, and built ~80% of my old PRs within the 1st 6 months. Many factors (internal & external) in between led to multiple layoffs & setbacks. Then early last year, I got COVID. Then injured my knee, which was my worst injury since I started lifting (not caused by it though.) And then the other knee.\n\nLong story short, I've been losing & regaining the same novice PRs for years, thus the soft plateau. Throughout that time, I have never been able to string together a consistent 3x weekly lifting cadence for more than a month. What I needed was consistency and structure. I also needed to keep losing weight. The Rippler felt like the obvious next step. It would be my first ever non-LP, a taste of early intermediate programming.\n\n**Changes I Made**\n\nBefore starting, I modified my existing GZCLP program to introduce SLDL, BTNP, & front squats in the T3 because I never did them and needed to train mobility. When starting The Rippler, I also swapped DB Row with the barbell row I was already doing, EZ bar to DB variants (don't own the former), & did front squat with cross grip (because fuck my front rack mobility).\n\nAfter the 1st T2 AMRAP week, my ending reps were crazy high - 15-20 on average. I decided to make large weight jumps each meso based on AMRAP reps, up to 10kg on upper & 15kg on lower.\n\nTowards the 2nd half of the program, I also decided to strategically up my T1 TMs to keep my AMRAPs lower & more specific to strength. This made every set harder, but still manageable. Around this time, I noticed my e1RM growth from the Week 5-8 AMRAPs, and plotted what weight jumps I needed to hit my new, ambitious goals of 1.5\/2\/3\/4 plates. It required almost linear progress in some lifts, but if I could make it, I needed to find out.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\n* Coming from 2 years of GZCLP, the majority of The Rippler is a big increase in volume, and it took weeks to adapt to. When I did however, the undulation of T1 & T2, plus the staggering of AMRAPs, was a huge breath of fresh air compared to doing heavy AMRAPs every single week.\n* Having the defined weeks, and actual percentages\/weights designated per week, was very sustainable.\n* The UL split with close variants in the T2 is so much fun! Very flexible too.\n* I was nervous about making my TM changes considering this was the first time I ever ran this program, but it turned out remarkably well.\n* This was also my first time experiencing a programmed peak & 1RM test. Matching my e1RM in all lifts, and then matching my fatigued 2RM in the next set, was the most empowering thing ever.\n* This program gave me the confidence to continue progressing my squats after consecutive knee injuries.\n* Dumbbell pullovers really sucked, for a long time, until I got the hang of it near the end. Now they only kind of suck.\n* I'm probably still a solid novice on DL, considering how much I added to it compared to the other lifts.\n* A lot of my progress may also be attributed to my failed cut-turned-bulk. Doing higher volume made me **hungry**, and I just lacked the control to keep my calories in check.\n* I love the variety of lifts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI failed my initial goal of cutting, but played to my strengths and hit my goal of 1\/1.5\/2\/3 plates on O\/B\/S\/D, with 3 of them as fatigued 2RMs! I also added 38kg (84lb) to my SBD total. I'm already running Rippler again, this time hoping to actually lose weight. Looking forward to Run 2 results.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674362925.0},{"title":"PROGRAM REVIEW] JACKED AND TANNED 2.0","author":"Hmcvey20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10i80as\/program_review_jacked_and_tanned_20\/","text":"[Mods if you can add a flair for some reason I can\u2019t without Reddit crashing]\n[PROGRAM REVIEW]  JACKED AND TANNED 2.0\n\n**INTRO**\n\nFinished up bullmastiff and ended up with 210\/130\/230 @85kg then got into a bit of a rut in training went on holiday at the end of July and when I came back I was very indecisive with my programming and I also started playing football more often (insert excuses) anyway after spinning my wheels for 2 months and feeling weak\/small I decided to run JNT to kick myself into gear. \n\n**NUTRITION**\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to any form of set out diet, I eat 4-5 meals a day and a shake where I feel it\u2019s needed, these meals are normally heavy on meat and carbs. I aim for a 1g of protein per Lb of Bw, and make sure my weight is going up, that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve tried set diets\/ counting calories and it bores me tbh. I meal prep for 3 days then change it up to keep things fresh.\n\n**CONDITIONING**\n\nI don\u2019t really do any \u201csport\u201d specific conditioning. I play football (English football (real football)) 2-3 times a week, this can be 6-9 aside it\u2019s fairly competitive and I\u2019m always knackered by the end. I also utilise short rest times in isolation movements.\n\n\n**THE PROGRAMME**\n\nJNT is one of the programmes under the GZCL umbrella I\u2019m sure everyone is familiar with the training principles involved. JNT is the one that appealed to me the most. It involves hitting a top 10\/8\/6\/4\/2 RM and maximal lifting is always something I have found works well for me especially for lower body, its also fun.\n\nOnly thing I changed on the program was the optional 5th day, first half of the program I ran it with barbell rows as the T1 T2 weighted chins and then T3s were back and arms. I did this as I felt my arms were lacking from a size and strength perspective and I also wanted to increase my row as who doesn\u2019t want a bigger\/stronger back. In the second block I swapped barbell rows for floor press in order to get more tricep work as they are a weakness in my presses.\n\nT1s Bench, Slingshot, Squat, Boxsquat, Barbell Row  \t\nBlock Two Bench, Slingshot, Floor press, Conv DL, Squat\n\nT2s OHP, CG Bench, Weighted Chins, Deficit DLs, RDLs\nBlock Two OHP, CG, Inc BB, Deficit DL, Box Squat\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE\/RESULTS**\nStart of the program I felt WEAK! \nStarting 10rm- Squat 140, Bench 90, Box Squat 140, 105 SLINGSHOT.\n\nThe first two weeks were just reps galore and not the most fun, as I progressed by week 3-4 I was getting back into the swing of things and enjoying training. I was excited to test however in the last 3 weeks of the first block I ended up getting tonsillitis and losing 3kg down to 81 then bulking back to 83 and had my wisdom teeth come in lol.\n\nWeek 6 (Testing) \n\nDidn\u2019t test anything other than squat, squat 215 failed.\n\nSecond block\nAfter a disappointing end to the first block, I had to gain weight I\u2019d lost back.

Partially to run in a cut, also because I travel for work sometimes and don't like lugging stuff around.\n\nI also recommend purchasing the actual program and running it through; Brian does have a free version on YouTube but if you've never run through his programming you might have trouble with some of the interpretations.\n\nBEFORE (With belt and sleeves):\n* 30M, 210\n* Squat 420 X 1\n* Bench\/BB Row 350 X 1\n* OHP 225 X 1\n* Deadlift 520 X 1\n* Neutral Grip Pullup +90 X 1\n\nAFTER (Beltless sleeveless but straps on DL):\n* 30M, 200\n* Squat 385 X 1\n* Bench\/BB Row 365 X 1\n* OHP 205 X 1\n* Deadlift 445 X 1 (I did hit 535 X 1 earlier. Had hit a bout of the flu for a bit during this time so it might be why I lifted less)\n* Neutral Grip Pullup +135 X 1\n\n**Program Design**\nI'll just give a 1 week example. There are 3 weeks in each \"phase\" or cycle and you do a total of 4 cycles. The last cycle is a test cycle where you go for your 1RM on the main movements instead of 2 reps. This program is designed around auto regulation, so keep that in mind. \n\n* Week 1 Day 1: 30 seconds heavy KB swings OR Sandbag Over Shoulder, (8, 6, 4, 2) Deadlifts (sumo or conv), 1:00 Plank, 90 seconds between rounds. Volume: Take 80% of top set above and take as many rounds to hit 12 total reps (continue doing the rest of the giant set). Assistance: 10 minute as many rounds as possible of 5 Tempo Romanian Deadlifts (moderately heavy), 25 DEEP goblet squats, 20 seconds leg curls\n\n* Week 1 Day 2: (9, 7, 5, 3) Widegrip Pullups (weighted preferred), (9, 7, 5, 3) Push Presses\/Jerks, 8 Plate Halos each side, 90 seconds between rounds. Volume: Take 80% of top set above and take as many rounds to hit 15 total reps. Assistance: (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) reps of pullups\/inverted rows and standing neutral grip DB Strict Press.\n\n* Week 1 Day 3: 6 Burpee Vertical Jumps, (10, 8, 6, 4) Pause Squats or Pin Squats, 25 hollow rocks, 90 seconds between rounds. Volume: Take 80% of top set above and take as many rounds to hit 20 total reps. Assistance: Load the bar with 40% of your TRUE 1RM Front Squat or Zercher & Get in front of a running clock (RPE 4 if no PR). Minute 1: 2 front\/zercher squats Minute 2: 4 front\/zercher squats etc...until you can't keep up with the clock\n\n* Week 1 Day 4: (8, 6, 4, 2) Bent over rows, (8, 6, 4, 2) Bench Presses, 30 seconds russian twists (weighted), 90 seconds between rounds. Volume: Take 80% of top set above and take as many rounds to hit 12 total reps. Assistance: 10 minutes as many rounds as possible of 7 close grip bench (moderately heavy), 8 dumbbell\/kettlebell pullovers, 10 - 20 deficit pushups (hands stacked on plates)\n\n**What I enjoyed**\n\n* I greatly appreciate Giant Sets. I've never been the biggest fan of straight sets and have been supersetting for years now. Adding core work has helped my lifts improve to the nth degree. I think it also forced me to be a bit more conservative than I normally would when lifting. Activation sets felt nice, hadn't used them in the past.\n\n* Conjugate elements. You don't do the main lifts week after week, but you'll go hard on the main movement and medium\/light days will have a variation that forces you to improve. Brian offers 2 choices on the variation days so someone could run through this program multiple times, which is a big reason I'd advocate in purchasing it. \n\n* Autoregulation. I never really ran with autoregulation before, always choosing a program that had percentages. When my life got hectic, I really enjoyed having the ability to go in and hit a lift hard relative to the day compared to an 85% front squat.\n\n* Rotating heavy\/medium\/light days works well for me. I'd notice that running some other programs (including a certain application that added set after set until I was at the gym for 3 hours) would feel good one week, then okay the next, then run over by a freight train the last week. Running this I'd get DOMS and feel sore, but by the time I wanted to lift again I'd be chomping at the bit. \n\n* I like having a number to reach for volume. I don't like to do 3 X 8 or 3 X 10. If I feel good to hit all 12 reps in one go, let me do it. Same with assistance work; such as put a bar at 50% your 1RM squat, then do 2 minutes of squatting(do not put the bar down!) rest 2 minutes (no bar) then do 1 minute of squatting rest 1 minute then 30 seconds of squatting. The last 30 seconds of the 2 minutes are the longest 30 seconds I've ever felt.\n\n**What I didn't enjoy**\n\n* Trying to determine weight on the assistance was *major* trial and error. Bodyweight stuff was always fun and I could knock it out; picking a \"moderate weight\" forced me to do like 4D chess. \n\n* Sometimes choosing which weight to start out with for a main mover would make or break my workout. I ended up doing 50% to start and that seemed to work...most of the time. There were plenty of times that I'd have a number I normally hit and I'd be struggling to pick it up. \n\n* I have a homegym(I enjoy that part lol) but some of the workouts would be difficult if I didn't have 2 bars\/equipment that I bought. I imagine you can run it in some gyms, but in a packed place like LA Fitness (do those still exist?) or a gym at peak hours I can't see someone really doing Dumbbell rows, close grip bench, and then some landmines. Hell, having to go to a commercial gym in CA I couldn't do Pin Press anymore which threw me off. \n\n**Recommendation?**\n\nShould you run this in a bulk? Probably not. Should you do minimalist training forever? No. Should you do it if you have 1 hour to dedicate to lifting? Yes! Do what you can to make training fit your schedule and needs. \n\nI highly recommend people purchase a program from Brian and run through it. His programs are tough but doable. And after completing one of them I actually do feel a sort of \"what now?\" This past week I've been taking it easy and not lifting or anything, but the itch has started to grow again.

I compete in powerlifting at 148lbs and ended up getting up to 165lbs before deciding it was time to cut again while running RTF to get down to 150. \n\n* For both of these programs I ran the 5x weeks versions, training Sun\/Mon\/We\u2019d\/Thur\/Fri and then Resting on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\n* For the Hypertrophy version, I did an over warm single for the main 4 movements almost every session. I ate in a caloric surplus of ~500cal and really tried to add size all over, even though I\u2019ve been training for a decade. \n\n* For the RTF version, I also did the over warm singles on the main 4 movements, and ate in a ~600-700 calorie deficit.\n\n* Supplements: Creatine, fish oil, and vitamin D\n\n\n**Results**\n\n* Hypertrophy - Gained 10lbs in 14wks putting 1\u201d on my neck, 1\u201d on each arm, 1\u201d on my thighs, 1\u201d on my chest, 1\/2\u201d on my shoulders, and 1\/4\u201d on my calves and forearms (I even trained calves 3x\/wk). I also hit [405lbs on back squat for 12 reps](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CXPADk6AP9l\/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=), then [a 20 rep max on SQ (335lbs)](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CZzxhTAO1Q5\/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=) and [on deadlift (445lbs)](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CZNGK99Brns\/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=)on one of my last AMRAP sets, AND I hit a PR on OHP by +15lbs because I was feeling so good\/confident due to all the over warm singles.\n* Pros: Build kick ass work capacity when you have 6-8 exercises each day and need to get it done in under 75min, Feel like a bodybuilder and have a better MMC since the weights are lighter[and feeling kinda jacked](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/it0qerU), and it gives my joints a break from all the heavy ass training I usually do.\n* Cons: Not accustomed to the heavier percentages so when going back to strength focus it takes awhile to adjust, You can feel pretty beat up after each workout and exhausted but totally worth it\n\n* RTF - Lost roughly 15lbs through the program, and increased my deadlift by 40lbs. I used week 21 as a deload and tested all three lifts at the end of the week. Squat stayed the same, because I hit 500 and felt okay so I jumped to 515lbs but failed the lift. My E1RM for squat was 520. Bench Press went down (as usual during my cuts), because I get 340 during testing and jumped to 350 but got stapled even though my E1RM was 366lbs. Deadlift\u2026this was the best thing about the whole program. I was on week 19 and was working up to a single and only got to 515lbs, which was well below what I was supposed to do for the day so I called it quits for DL and did all my other exercises. I thought about it all day at work and so after work I decided to go at it again, hitting 545lbs for 5 reps, then I said \u201cF* It, I\u2019m going for a PR\u201d and pulled 605lbs. It\u2019s been a dream of mine for YEARS to pull over 600 and [I DID THE DAMN THING!!](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CdtVsDOOb-j\/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=) \n* Pros: Low reps and heavier weight to practice my sport and master technique, Not super fatiguing compared to the Hypertrophy version, Didn\u2019t feel as beat up physically and mentally either\n* Cons: CAN be fatiguing if doing lots of accessories on top of over warm singles and working sets, especially in a deficit. Plus the programs can be super boring and monotonous (that goes for all of the programs)\n\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n* I enjoyed this program. While I know my Squat and Bench took hits during my cut, I still got a lot out of the program and definitely plan to run it again. I would probably drop OHP and make it another Bench day, add a set to all my bench and bench auxiliaries, and just cut slower next time if I do it in a deficit.\n* I absolutely LOVED hitting back in some form every single day I was in the gym. You can never pull too much\n*5x a week full body is perfect for me running this program. I like the higher frequency because it means more time to master my craft in a less fatigued state. \n* 9\/10 and would recommend others give it a shot.

So my \"peak during program\" column are the best sets that I had at some point during the program.\n\n\n |  Start| Peak during program\n-----|----|----\nWeight|  174| 189\nSquat|  285x5| 295x5\nBench|  225x1| 225x6\nDeadlift|  330x1| 320x5\nOHP|  135x1| 135x2\n\n\n**Starting point**\n\nAfter vacillating between bulking\/cutting as one does, I decided to say screw it and just try to lift big and get bigger. I've spent a lot of time in the \"I don't have abs\" mindset and it's hindered growth for a while. I'm not lean by any stretch but I figured I'd stop spinning my wheels and just go for it. Feel like I don't look any more or less muscular, just that I've \"expanded\" a few percent. Really am looking forward to comparing physiques when\/if I get back down to my starting weight.\n\nStarting physique: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w0fpbcN\n\nEnding physique: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/iQb7jk1\n\nFor all programs, I added face pulls in direct proportion to any pressing movements. Generally I would just superset the two.\n\n**Beefcake**\n\nI thought this was by far the most enjoyable, tough but short enough that it didn't become a slog. I started with a slightly more aggressive TM than I should have, but did the main sets in 5\/3\/1 style as opposed to 5's pro. After the first three weeks I changed to 5's pro and found the FSLx10 sets more challenging. If I run this again I think I would keep the main sets in 5\/3\/1 style, I preferred feeling a bit more fresh for the FSLx10. Suppose it depends how much you want to suffer.\n\nI subbed incline bench for OHP because I was still working through some shoulder issues, in the future I would not do this again. The rest of the program made me realize how effective OHP is, if your shoulder hurts then do some rear delt work and stretches.\n\n**Building the Monolith**\n\nI decided to carry over my TM from the last three-week block of Beefcake. In hindsight this worked for everything except for squat. During the middle of Beefcake I decided on a whim to take a video of a squat set, and discovered that I was squatting quite high. It wasn't so much that I \"just wasn't\" reaching bottom, it was that I physically was straining myself to get parallel, usually ending up moving my whole body forward and good morning-ing my squats. During this time I tried different stances\/setup's to try to get to parallel, and naturally I didn't lower my squat weights in proportion to the change.\n\nAs you can imagine, this didn't work well, and I really struggled with the week 3 squat days. It wasn't until the end of this program that I really figured out my squat issues. Basically poor ankle mobility has been restricting me. Along with stretches I bought a pair of squat shoes with an elevated heel, and the difference is staggering. Squatting to parallel feels like second nature, no more discomfort.\n\nAnyways, if I run this program again I would bump up the widowmaker weights for the first few weeks, I found them almost too easy. \n\n**Deep Water Beginner**\n\nThe first two weeks of the program I thought \"Really? This is it?\" Oh to be young and na\u00efve. After completing this, I feel tougher, like I've come face-to-face with pain and didn't blink. Normal workouts feel like a walk in the park. \"Just three sets of squats? Is that really enough?\" \n\nThat being said, I feel like this program made me sick. Legitimately, after both the second squat day and the third squat day I came down with a mild illness. Not sure if it was a cold or covid or what, maybe it was coincidental, maybe my body was shutting down trying to repair the damage to my legs. I don't know, I'm not a doctor. But I'm not one of those people who work through illness, I stopped lifting until I recovered. I also played touch football during this program, and since I only play once every two months or so my legs were shot for a few days after playing.\n\nOverall it took my about 9 weeks to get through this factoring in illness, soreness, and a few minor tweaks. Maybe don't run this program during the winter sick season? Another issue has to be just poor recovery, while sick I wasn't eating much. I actually didn't really gain weight between the start and end of this program, so it's possible I wasn't eating enough to recover and that contributed to my illnesses.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nAlmost don't even need to write anything here. Didn't follow any diet plans. Just ate based on hunger, and tried to eat a lot of protein and healthy foods. Didn't work so well during the holidays when I had baked goods coming out the wazoo, but when you run programs like these and work hard, you will be insatiably hungry. The days after deep water sets I felt like I could shovel food endlessly down my gullet and never felt satisfied.\n\n**What worked**\n\nI learned what a gaining program should really be like, in contrast to me previous \"bulking programs\".\n\nFeel like my discipline improved. This program is more tough mentally than physically in my opinion. The penultimate squat days make you really consider if it's worth doing (it is). \n\nAll the overhead pressing. I have never pressed this much, but I can tell the difference. Probably not a coincidence my bench went from 225x1 to 225x6 after a few months of more pressing.\n\nFacepulls to offset the pressing. As someone with not-so-great posture and a job at a computer, shoulder pain is a dear old friend of mine. I found that even with the increase in pressing volume, so long as I did proportionate real delt work, I didn't have any increase in shoulder pain.\n\nDips, weighted dips will be a staple come the summertime when I move my lifting set to the garage and my dip bars aren't ice cold.\n\nThe deadlifting! Turns out you can do more than one heavy deadlift set in a workout. Who knew? I set my deep water deadlift weight based on a 1rm that I haven't done but feel like I could, and the deadlift days felt...not too bad. My highest single in deadlift is 330lb, and during the BTM block I did 320lbx5 and it felt easy. I feel like when I get back to heavy lifting my deadlift is going to soar past where it was.\n\n**What didn't**\n\nThe 100 chin-up day on BTM is terrible if you're like me and have poor chin-up endurance. If I run the program again I think I'll divvy it up between multiple days.\n\nI did a lot of conditioning at the start and felt great. Slowly but surely I did less and less, and didn't feel so great at the end. Just ten minutes a day on rest days was enough, but I'm lazy and didn't do it. I really should have. \n\nI went right from BTM to deep water without a break and my body has paid the price. My knees just hurt. I would feel tired going into workouts. One time I somehow hurt my knee while tying my shoe and had to miss that day. I believe mythical recommends taking a 7-week diet break in the middle of the program, I think that would function well as a rest period for your body. When you run this program hard, you really feel it. \n\n**Looking ahead**\n\nGoing to give my joints a break and do the 10000 swing challenge. Might help shed some of the fluff I put on (looking at you raspberry crumble bars). Going to try to do conditioning on the off days and some upper body (vanity) work as well. Hoping it will strengthen my posterior chain and core, and hopefully make my forearms look better. Want them to really pop out of rolled-up sleeves. After that, going to do strength work running simple jack'd and starting working my way up to the 1000lb club, and preparing for a friendly meet in a few months. My best friend has always said that he'd never let me be stronger than him, and I'm closing the gap.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674091111.0},{"title":"January 19 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10ft1le\/january_19_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1674104470.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Upper Back (Aesthetics)","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10f5p10\/weakpoint_wednesday_upper_back_aesthetics\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

It was an experience that I want to revisit in some fashion once a year, so wrapping up 2022 with another run seemed like a good idea.\n\nu\/dadliftsnruns' [progress on PED](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/rkme3l\/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_benching\/) inspired u\/garret1234 to run it for strict press, and since the two of us have become competitive over the last several months (read: he keeps being stronger than me and it pisses me off) I figured I would give it a shot.\n\nBut there's only so much time before I need to train hard for Nats! What to do?\n\nIt seemed to me that the volume on both PED and SS are really pretty low, and that one wouldn't interfere much with the other - so hey, why not try doing both at the same time?\n\n*Modifications*\n\nI made some changes to DadRuns' spreadsheet to make it more suitable for strict press: [here's a copy if anyone would like to give it a go](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1nsNu4yjzyJeLaKMfB7ellFIV-NBaXDsG\/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109297618475493917028&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n\nAlso, I bought a safety squat bar late in 2022, and discovered that my upper back was holding me back in a lot of ways, so I thought it would be fun to do breathing squats with the SSB. I did decide that instead of the rest of the assistance exercises listed in Super Squats, I would Press Every Day and do the assistance work suggested on the spreadsheet, and squat every two or three days depending on how I felt. I did no deadlifting at all as I strained something in my hip pretty badly at my December comp.\n\nI ran this setup for about four weeks.\n\n*Results*\n\nIn October, I [set a PR on strict press at 210 pounds](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/RCV4SNWtAjQ?feature=share). Today, [I pressed an easy 225](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/HJV90tkXRys?feature=share) and failed 235; I'll get 230 in the next couple of weeks to keep me motivated as I start cutting weight. And I got a chance to throw some volume in with u\/Frodozer's [Strict press challenge](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/strength_training\/comments\/102owoe\/strict_press_competition\/), which I hope some more people will go give a shot.\n\nI started my breathing squats at 240x21, and [wrapped up last week with 315x20](https:\/\/youtu.be\/_5utJFC3jt4). Along the way, I also [squatted 225x54](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2nnXujhnciI) for my 42nd birthday, and right now I weigh about 225. I set a couple of PRs on the safety squat bar, topping out at 405x1, and my low bar PR of 435 feels like butter. I'm pretty confident that I'll hit 475 low bar on my cut and my goal is 500.\n\n*Talk talk talk*\n\nI didn't eat enough to really support a hard push on either the squats or the pressing: I did not gain any weight after the first week of this run (and even that was mostly regaining the ten pounds I dropped for competition). I won't be competitive unless I drop some pounds for shows in April and June, and while I'm not worried about crash dieting 20 pounds, dropping 30 sounds miserable.\n\n15 pounds on my press is pretty rad and all - and I got some headspace gains on the breathing squats again, so I'm glad I did that again this year - but this would definitely be worth more from a *gainz* perspective if I weren't watching my weight at the same time.\n\nMostly, I want to share the edited spreadsheet in case it's useful to others, and leave this for anyone who has wondered if pairing a couple of methods like this would be sustainable. I for one will be exploring this method next time I'm ready to put on some weight: my bench sucks and this fall I might go after it hard with something like this.\n\nThat's all!","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673563630.0},{"title":"January 13 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10alra3\/january_13_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673586070.0},{"title":"January 12 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/109qvjx\/january_12_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673499670.0},{"title":"[BOOK REVIEW] Dan John's Easy Strength Omnibook","author":"MythicalStrength","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/109b6t0\/book_review_dan_johns_easy_strength_omnibook\/","text":"* **INTRO**\n\n* Dan John has been teasing the release of his Easy Strength Omnibook for months now over various podcasts and I\u2019m just going to flat out say: it was worth the wait.  Folks: buy this book.  I\u2019ll go into details shortly, but I want to lead with the conclusion.  I pre-ordered this book as soon as it was available and was able to download it on Christmas Eve and could not put it down until it was finished.  This is Dan in top form.\n\n[Here is the link to buy it](https:\/\/danjohnuniversity.com\/bookstore)\n\n**WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT?**\n\n* Fundamentally, this is a 300+ page e-book on the Easy Strength program, which, in turn, is a program comprised of 5 sentences from Pavel Tsastouline relayed to Dan John a few decades ago.\n\n\n> \u201cFor the next forty workouts, pick five lifts. Do them every workout. Never miss a rep, in fact, never even get close to struggling. Go as light as you need to go and don\u2019t go over ten reps for any of the movements in a workout. It is going to seem easy. When the weights feel light, simply add more weight.\u201d\n\n\n* That Dan is able to write 300 pages on 5 sentences speaks to a few different qualities.  One is that Pavel is amazingly talented at taking a complex idea and boiling it down into a simple executable plan, and Dan, in turn, is amazingly talented at taking simple executable plans and digging VERY deep into the \u201cwhys\u201d and \u201chows\u201d.  Alongside that, it speaks to how, it doesn\u2019t matter HOW simple you make the plan: people will STILL screw it up.  And Dan admits to doing just that a few times while running this on his own, going too heavy sometimes, too high in volume on swings, the many many MANY failed attempts to include squats into the program, etc.  And he does a great job of detailing all these adventures, and many more discoveries, through the book.\n\n**WHAT THE BOOK ISN\u2019T ABOUT**\n\n\n* Unlike Mass Made Simple (another fantastic read), this is not a book about putting on mass.  It\u2019s not a book about maximizing conditioning.  It\u2019s not a book about improving sports skills.  \n\n* Easy Strength, the program, is about doing exactly what is needed to ensure one has the necessary strength TO PERFORM.  One must remember that Dan coaches ATHLETES: not lifters.  And yes: you can lift AS an athletic activity (and Dan DOES have an Easy Strength with Olympic Lifting program in the book), but one has to approach the book and program with the understanding that lifting is the MEANS: NOT the end.  And strength, in turn, is a means to an end in the whole spectrum of how Dan approaches training.\n\n* As much as I (and many of you) would love to be superhuman strong, it\u2019s worth appreciating that, for sports, there comes a point where enough strength IS enough, and the benefit of pushing strength further will not be worth the opportunity cost that comes with spending that time and energy in other venues (specifically, doing those things that get us BETTER at the sport).\n\n* By Dan\u2019s admission (and demonstration), and Easy Strength workout takes about 15 minutes.  This is the amount of time dedicated in a whole athlete program toward the specific goal of developing strength to support athletics.  This does not necessarily mean that the athlete\u2019s WORKOUT is only 15 minutes: it means we\u2019ve streamlined the process of strength building down to its most essential elements so that we can now spend MORE of our time improving ourselves at sports.\n\n**HOW WOULD I APPLY THIS?**\n\n* I am not reviewing the Easy Strength program, because I have not done it.  What I am writing is merely my understanding, and a \u201cwhat I WOULD do\u201d approach.\n\n* But say you were an MMA athlete.  You have a demand to improve your conditioning, striking skills, grappling skills, and strength.  That\u2019s a LOT of demands, and many struggle trying to balance all of them.\n\n* With Easy Strength, you could start your daily training with a 15 minute EASY workout that achieves the objectives of building strength to support MMA.  Dan picks basic, fundamental human movements for his 5 here (upper body push, upper body pull, hinge, ab wheel and loaded carry), which will cover all the basis of strength needed for an athlete.  As trendy as it is to have some sort of incredibly complicated and overly specific strength training protocol with bosu balls and stability training, those qualities can be developed through the actual ATHLETIC training of the athlete.  Here: we\u2019re just making ourselves stronger.\n\n* After those 15 minutes, one can then move on to whatever objective needs covering that day.  Striking, conditioning, grappling, etc etc.\n\n* And, of course, you can see how to extrapolate that to other athletic realms. As a Strongman competitor, I could start my training day off with an Easy Strength workout to make sure I am strong ENOUGH for my sport, and from there spend time doing conditioning drills, working technique on the implements, or even turn it around and do some muscle building work if I\u2019m in an off season. \n\n* The other application of Easy Strength would be in line with Dan John\u2019s \u201cbus bench-park bench\u201d protocol, along with his discussions on minimalism.  Easy Strength is a \u201cminimalist\u201d program: it\u2019s the lowest dose needed to still get results.  These protocols are great to follow after periods of MAXIMAL training: were we\u2019ve been pushing the volume and intensity hard in order to accomplish some sort of radical physical transformation.  This is balance, it\u2019s duality, it\u2019s basic periodization.  And, typically, after that really intense training, a program like this allows us to REALIZE all that we\u2019ve built, which is just a fantastic experience.\n\n* One could easily do this with some of Dan\u2019s programs.  6 weeks of Mass Made Simple, 2 months of Easy Strength, 4 weeks of the 10k swing challenge, 2 months of Easy Strength, etc.  Dan even lays out a schedule just like this in the book.  \n\n**WHY I LIKE THE BOOK**\n\n* Dan John personifies signal-to-noise ratio and this book is in top form for it.  At 300+ pages, there is no filler.  Points get repeated, yes, but differently enough that they ENHANCE the understanding of the reader, compared to Stuart McRobert in \u201cBeyond Brawn\u201d who is just brow beating the reader with the same point, or Brooks Kubrik in Dinosaur Training (a book I have STARTED multiple times and simply cannot get through because of the writing style).  I never wanted to put this book down, and I was sad when it was over.  As soon as I\u2019d finish a chapter, I\u2019d see the title of the next one and think \u201cOh damn, THIS chapter is going to be even better than the last!\u201d, and I\u2019d get sucked in and discover I was right.\n\n* And I say all this as someone with no intention of running the program in the near future.  I was the same way with Mass Made Simple.  And I re-read that book constantly too.  That\u2019s because Dan is able to take local lessons and apply them on a global level.  SO many of the lessons on Easy Strength that Dan shares are lessons that can easily be applied outside of that specific arena, to include training for athletes, balancing of workloads, an appreciation for what qualities matter and what don\u2019t, talks on nutrition and fat loss, a fantastic discussion on what makes the squat a great mass building movement whereas the deadlift is more a strength building movement, etc.  \n\n* Dan took 40+ years of coaching experience and put it into 300+ pages of written word, broken down into easy to read and digest 2-4 page chapters that are laser focused and hard hitting.  This book is a gift to humanity.  \n\n**WHO WON\u2019T LIKE IT**\n\n* If the only reason you read training books is for a spreadsheet and photos demonstrating how to do exercises, you will not enjoy this.  If you want a book on extreme transformation, you will not like this.  If you do not like to read in general, you will not like this.\n\n**SHOULD YOU BUY IT?**\n\n* Yes.  100% yes.  It\u2019s currently in e-book format: get it as an e-book.  If it gets a hard release: get that too.  \n\n* Be happy to field questions about my experience reading it.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673460011.0},{"title":"How to get more arch for the Bench Press with JM Blakley","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_dpKPSJ5sek","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1673477853.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Lats (Aesthetics)","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10930q8\/weakpoint_wednesday_lats_aesthetics\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

After seeing the [non-drug-related PED post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zxrhiz\/peds_a_casual_users_experience\/) and getting inspired, I figured I\u2019d share an actual PED experience since I just completed my first training block with PEDs in the mix. All info for education\/entertainment\/harm-reduction purposes. There are shockingly few cycle reports on the internet that are specifically from a powerlifting or strength training perspective. Most are more bodybuilding\/aesthetics oriented and by intermediate-level lifters, so it can be challenging to get an idea of the kind of progress that is achievable for strength.\n\nOne thing you\u2019ll quickly learn is that there are very few sources of reliable information out there. Places like the wiki on r\/steroids are *decent* but are definitely oversimplified for the sake of the audience. Most people already can\u2019t seem to bother reading that, so if it were even more complex, it just wouldn\u2019t work from a harm-reduction approach. Most people go into PEDs having read forums or watched videos from MPMD (not a good source of info imo)\u2026 and not with the guidance of one of the few reputable coaches out there. I know I made mistakes, so hopefully, someone can learn from them.\n\nThis is going to be long, and I make no apologies for it. Throwaway due to personal information on my main, so I won\u2019t be sharing videos of the lifts directly in this post. Bummer because I'm proud af about these lifts and the standard they were done to. Here are the cliffs: \n\nThe Cycle:\n\n* 20 weeks total duration\n* 400mg Test C\/week for all 20 weeks\n* 300mg Primo E\/ week added @ week 12 through 20\n* 50mg Anavar on heavy training days only (3x week) added @ week 18 through 20\n* 12.5mg Accutane\/day added @ week 16 onward (ongoing)\n* Comprehensive blood panel done before, mid-cycle, and post-cycle\n* No AI use (but had Aromasin and Raloxifene on-hand)\n\n**Results Summary**\n\n X | Before | After | Absolute Change | % Change\n---|------|-----|---------------|--------\n**Squat** | 215kg \/ 475lbs  | 267.5kg \/ 589.7lbs | +114lbs | +24%\n**Bench** | 134kg \/ 295lbs | 167.5kg \/ 369.2lbs | +74lbs | +25%\n**Deadlift** | 256kg \/ 565lbs | 302.5kg \/ 666.9lbs | +102lbs | +18%\n**Total** | 605kg \/ 1,335lbs | 737.5kg \/ 1,626lbs | +291lbs | +22%\n**DOTS scores** | 430 | 490 | +60pts | +14%\n**Bodyweight** | 76kg \/ 168lbs | 85.5kg \/ 188lbs | +20lbs | +12%\n\n**Background**\n\nTL;DR: 27 y\/o with ~10 years of training exp, mostly strength sports. Decent athlete. Never really trained for hypertrophy. \n\nPersonally, I find it helpful to have a deeper sense of someone\u2019s background before a PED cycle, so I\u2019ll provide a longer version as well:\n\nWas never athletic growing up but eventually fell in love with training during high school when I started track. Ended up setting some national records in my age group. Nothing super elite, but pretty decent and enough to get noticed by some D1 schools and continue track in college. Continued lifting in college with a focus on Olympic lifting and powerlifting. Spent most of my time in the weight room since I was also interning with our S&C dept. I never looked strong\/athletic, but I was certainly able to move like it. After college, I focused on powerlifting but eventually got a bit burnt out. Right before this cycle, I stopped lifting consistently for a few months and focused on some backcountry skiing\/mountaineering and climbing goals. Got all the way down to 155ish and after ski season ended, decided to get back on the lifting train.\n\n**Cycle Goals**\n\nMy motivations were mostly personal. My desire to compete in tested powerlifting at a high level was mostly over. I just wanna be strong, look strong, and do cool shit. Though, after this cycle, I'm stoked to compete USPA untested. PEDs were always something I was curious about, and 27 seemed like a good age to take the dive. My life is in the most stable place it\u2019s ever been, and I knew I would be able to prioritize training enough to justify the health risks within my tolerance. Once the decision was made mentally, I did a few months of on-and-off research and talked with my partner to ensure she was on board too. I thought she would have some objections, but shockingly she had no issues with it and fully trusted me to be responsible about it (crazy how healthy relationships work). Having her be part of the process was super helpful as I could talk through sides with her and have help with pins (glute pins are annoying to do solo). Funny story with the first pin that I'll save since this is already a long-ass post, but happy to share it in the comments.\n\n\n**Overall Experience**\n\nI have many pages of detailed notes that I journaled throughout this cycle. I\u2019ll try to condense the key bits:\n\n**Side effects:** much less than expected. First 10-12 weeks were very smooth. The best way to describe it is that I had superpowers in the gym, but nothing else changed. If I had secretly been administered a drug without my knowledge, my only suspicion would be that I made exceptional progress in the gym. Sleep, sex drive, acne, blood pressure, everything was around baseline levels. In the last 8 weeks, I did notice more in the way of sides. Acne picked up with the addition of primo (common for a DHT derivative, likely related to total anabolic load increasing as well). I've always had acne, and decided to take this opportunity to get on a low-dose of Accutane (good choice so far). Blood pressure spiked significantly with Anavar, but dropped off immediately upon ceasing use. Can\u2019t comment on hair loss as MPB runs in my family, and I had already shaved my head prior to cycle. My body hair increased a bit compared to the beginning, and my beard has filled in more, which was a pro in my eyes.\n\n**Blood Tests:** If there\u2019s interest, I\u2019m happy to scrub my personal info and share these directly. @ mid-cycle (10 weeks) all values were within normal ranges with a few elevated above baseline. For the end of the cycle, I\u2019ll be getting blood drawn this week, so TBD. I am anticipating worse results, but hopefully, nothing shocking. Either way, it will be a data point for next time. I review my results with a close friend who also happens to be an ER general surgeon + powerlifter familiar with PEDs. Reviewing blood tests through a PED-user lens is not his job, so I know to take what he says with a grain of salt, but it\u2019s still a very helpful gut check to get a better understanding of everything and catch any red flags. I plan on getting an echocardiogram done every 1-2 years as well--though I haven't looked into that too much yet.\n\n**Training Experience:** During my cycle, I worked with a powerlifting coach who essentially put me on a template very similar to the ones The Strength Guys would use (he was coached under Jason for a number of years). For those unfamiliar, these are quite high-volume programs. For some context, my weekly squat tonnage (working sets only) peaked at ~110,000 lbs, which is about double what I\u2019ve done in the past. There were a few workouts in particular that really tested my focus and perseverance. Although it was challenging, I felt pretty great throughout the cycle and block. No injuries to report--just some knee irritation that cropped up during the volume peak. The solution to this was to switch back to heels and be even more strict with technique while dropping volume for a few weeks. Small technical errors cannot be overlooked with this kind of workload.\n\n**Diet and Recovery:** I did not strictly track during this training block. I\u2019m quite good at intuitively estimating and roughly tracking my food and macro intake as I have done so previously for years. I aimed to be at a surplus for this whole block, and for the most part, I believe I succeeded. I have to thank my partner here as they prepped almost all my meals based on my requests; very lucky to have that. Slept 7-8 hours on most nights. Stress was pretty low for the duration of the block. \n\n**Future Plans**\n\nI\u2019ll be dropping down to TRT for the next 6 months (to be dialed in via blood tests to ensure im within physiological range\u2026 not over). During this time, I\u2019ll focus more heavily on skiing and climbing and hopefully tick off some backcountry objectives. Starting in Feb, I\u2019ll be working with a new coach with the intention of prepping for a meet in August @ 82.5kg. It will actually be my first time competing, although I've been at many meets to handle friends or my GF. Trying to not worry about numbers too much, but I'd love to take all the relevant USPA state records and break 500 DOTS.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nUnsurprisingly, PEDs work. However, I was pretty surprised by the amount of progress I made. Based on discussions I\u2019ve had with coaches, it's likely that I\u2019m a stronger responder to PEDs than most, and I was in an ideal living situation to prioritize training and recovery. YMMV, I wouldn\u2019t expect to add 300lbs to my total like this again (lol, imagine), nor would I encourage anyone else to expect it for themselves.\n\nIn hindsight, I would change a lot about this cycle. I probably would have started with a lower dose of test, I would have subbed in masteron for primo, and run a lower dose of anavar. My peak anabolic load was 850mg\/week (for the final 2 weeks), this was absolutely higher than necessary for a first cycle. Thankfully, I handled it well from a health perspective (pending final blood work) and made exceptional progress, but had I known better, I likely would have started lower. I've spent a lot of time trying to absorb whatever information Joe Jefferys, John Jewett, and Broderick Chavez have put out, and it's given me a lot of food for thought on cycle design, harm-reduction approaches to PED use, and the concept of poly-pharmacy. If you're considering the use of PEDs, i would strongly advise considering some of the content these people put out, as I believe it will result in safer and more informed use than what you can gather via other avenues like forums. Also, do your cardio. I didn't do enough of it during my cycle, and it's certainly something I plan to incorporate more heavily next time.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions since I know I did not cover everything above.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673290379.0},{"title":"January 10 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/1081442\/january_10_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673326870.0},{"title":"A Primer on Emerging Strategies","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/107ddm2\/a_primer_on_emerging_strategies\/","text":"I\u2019ve been fascinated with the idea of Emerging Strategies since Mike talked about it on the SBS Podcast however long ago. A structured way to personalize training and go about figuring out what works best for a trainee? What\u2019s not to like?\n\nOn the macro level everyone does that over the long term. But at a certain point you\u2019re kind of just throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. You\u2019re still sort of doing that with ES but somehow it feels different. \n\nAnyways I felt like I needed to try something new after my most recent layoff. So I did a massive deep dive into the method and stitched it together as best as I could. Honestly I think I\u2019ve got a solid handle on it, but until I have a spare thousand dollars to drop on the course I guess I\u2019ll never know. \n\nI also wanted to do this now instead of later like I originally planned because there\u2019s a ton of new lifters that\u2019ll be coming around with the new year. And we know all of them will want to make their own programs, this might at least help them do it a little bit better. \n\nAnyway, there is a list of references at the bottom. Feel free to check my work.\n\n#What is Emerging Strategies\n\nEmerging Strategies is Mike T and RTS\u2019 framework that they have been using to more effectively measure athlete response and customize programs to individuals. They have a full course on it up on the RTS site. But there are enough breadcrumbs on the internet that you can piece it together on your own. \n\nMike got it\u2019s roots from the Bonderchuck system for training field athletes. Specifically throwers. \n\nUnlike more \u201ctraditional\u201d programming systems it follows a bottom up approach instead of a top down approach. \n\nWhat does that mean? Basically it means instead of starting with a full training cycle planned out from start to finish you start with a Microcycle and run it until it stops working. Thereby creating a larger block of training. \n\nAt least that\u2019s the starting point. ES is simple to start but will become more complex the longer you work with it and figure out everything that works for you. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that this is also a very methodical approach to training. It\u2019s slow and a bit ponderous and will take years of use to really see the benefits. You\u2019ll understand what I mean once I get into it a bit more. \n\n#Key Concepts\n\nSo we need to start somewhere and while some of you might be familiar with these ideas we can\u2019t really have a useful discussion without making sure everyone is on the same page. \n\n*Development Block*\n\nA development block is the meat and potatoes of the system. Typically it is a single week of training repeated until you stop improving. You measure improvement by measuring your 1RM\/E1RM for you competition\/focus movements. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that your goal has to be to improve your 1RM\/E1RM. But that is, generally, how you will measure your response. \n\n*Exploration Block*\n\nThis is a block of training where you try something new. Whether that\u2019s a new movement, a different rep range or different RPE targets. \n\nDepending on how far out you are from a competition or a goal will decide how much you explore new ideas that you have. \n\n*Time to Peak (TtP)*\n\nPretty straightforward. This is how long it takes for your lifts to stop responding to a stimulus. Everyone\u2019s TtP will be different but it is, generally, the same for all lifts. \n\n*Pivot Block*\n\nA short block of training (compared to a Dev Block) that would be a deload week in a traditional program. Mike T and RTS prefer to call this a washout or resensitization phase. \n\n*Exposures*\n\nThis ties into TtP and can easily be mistaken as lift frequency. Basically it is how often you do your competition\/focus lift at a specific intensity and rep range. \n\n\n#Applying Emerging Strategies \n\nSo I haven\u2019t really done anything helpful here, just repeated a lot of things that you\u2019ve probably already heard Mike say on podcasts or in videos before. \n\nThings like, \u201cDon\u2019t change things often, follow your response to the training, repeat with small changes and measure that until a picture of what works best emerges.\u201d\n\nWe all do this. We run long programs, run them again with tweaks if they worked well or move on if they didn\u2019t. But Emerging Strategies is about taking that top down view and turning it on its head. We\u2019re not really working with Macrocycles or training blocks\u2026 at least not yet. \n\n**Setting up your first Development Block**\n\nThis was the hardest part for me. So I\u2019m hoping I can save you all some time.  First, let\u2019s be clear. What\u2019s in here are *examples*, there are a lot of ways to set-up a Dev Block. Mike T says to make sure you start with what you know works. \n\nSo let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe first and only thing you do when you are putting together your first Dev Block is to build a week of training. \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nThe following examples will use the General Gainz framework because it was the easiest system that I had a good understanding of, could fit into a week and I knew had previously worked for me. \n\nYou can use something else if you want. \n\n*Example 1:*  \n\nT1: Find 3RM @9  \nT2a: Find 7RM @8  \nT2b: Find 10RM @8  \n\n*Example 2:*  \nT1: Find 3RM @8, Push to 6RM @8  \nT2a: Find 6RM @8, Push to 10RM @8  \nT2b: Find 8RM @8, Push to 12RM @8\n\nBoth of these are a simple microcycle that you can repeat over and over week after week until you hit your Time to Peak. Now I can hear some of you saying \u201cwait! But the second one doesn\u2019t repeat!\u201d\n\nWhich is true and isn\u2019t. Just because you\u2019re trying to repeat a week doesn\u2019t necessarily mean *everything* about that week needs to be the same. \n\nIn the first example your performance measures are your RPE and Rep Max. Your RPE is staying the same but the weight of that Rep Max is going up? Awesome, that is a positive response. See how long it lasts (I.e Measure your Time to Peak). \n\nFor the second you are measuring essentially the same things but without looking to add weight to the bar. See how long you can add reps to a weight, then add some weight and see how long you can do it again. And of course measure your TtP with that stimulus. \n\n**Measuring your Time to Peak**\n\nThis is the easiest part. Your main measure is going to be an Estimated 1RM. Just run that Microcycle until you have 2-3 weeks where that measure goes down. The week before that first \u201cbad\u201d session gives you your time to peak. \n\nIf you use RPE, consider creating your own customized RPE Chart (see reference #21). You can better calculate your 1RM that way.  \n\nNow, not all TtPs will look the same should you chart them on a graph. Some people will improve week to week, some will improve then have an under performing week and then improve again (it might even happen a few times before seeing multiple poor performance weeks), and others might not see performance increases for weeks before finally shooting up. Mike talks about this a lot in Reference 1. It\u2019s well worth a watch. \n\nThe point is that your TtP is unique, but should also be stable across all of your lifts for a fairly long time. Look at your training logs, I\u2019ll guarantee that you can find a pattern. Weeks in a training block where you absolutely shit the bed for no reason and I\u2019ll bet that it\u2019s pretty consistent once you start looking. \n\n**Troubleshooting your TtP**\n\nSometime during a Development Block you might find that you have a different TtP for one or more of your lifts. The first thing you\u2019ll want to do is stop and look at your Microcycle. Do you have some T2 work that is in a similar Rep range and intensity level? (I\u2019m going to make them obvious as an illustration)\n\nExample:  \nT1 Press: Find 5RM @8  \nT2a Incline Press: Find 6RM @8 \n\nThey\u2019re probably counting as two Exposures instead of one. Shortening your TtP. In your next Dev Block change that T2a lift to a rep range that is further from the T1 and see what happens to your TtP for those lifts. \n\nYou\u2019ve done that a few times and no matter what your TtP doesn\u2019t match up? Congrats! You\u2019re an oddity, but at least you know how to plan around it. \n\nNow, I can see the gears turning in some of your heads so let\u2019s keep with a theme. \n\n**Manipulating your TtP**\n\nThat\u2019s right. You figured it out, Exposures lead to you being able to manipulate your TtP. Now we don\u2019t necessarily want to mix Exposures up with Frequency. Your competition\/focus lift is the thing we\u2019re measuring and is the main aspect that governs Exposures. \n\nOr at least it should be. \n\nSo, say your TtP is 6 weeks and you\u2019ve just started a new Dev Block but you have randomly decided to enter a meet in three weeks. What do you do? Obviously you want your last \u201cExposures\u201d to the competition lifts to land on competition day. Instead of building a microcycle that is a week long, you\u2019ll build one that is two days long and run it twice a week so that you are Exposed to two of your competition lifts in the same way every week. \n\nThis should halve your TtP. \n\nNow obviously you wouldn\u2019t want to do that going into a competition unless you\u2019ve played around with it before. You can\u2019t actually be sure that it will halve it unless you e tried it before. But in general it should. \n\nSimilarly you could create a two week microcycle where you only have one exposure and double your TtP. \n\nBut now that you\u2019ve found your TtP it\u2019s time for us to talk about\n\n**Pivot Blocks**\n\nYour deloads that aren\u2019t deloads! Mike T\/RTS *really* like making sure that you know these are about resensitization and not about taking a break. I also like thinking about them as a bridge between blocks. After all you know where you\u2019re going (either because you\u2019ve done it before or because you know there\u2019s something new you want to try), so approach it from that perspective. \n\nEither take a \u201ctypical\u201d deload where you just ease off the rep range, intensity or whatever you want, just do something a little different. Do things you haven\u2019t been doing. \n\nExample 1: keep the Development Block going but sub out all of your lifts for different ones. \n\nExample 2: You\u2019re moving into a hypertrophy block. Pick some mid Rep work to get yourself prepared for the high rep work at a slightly lower RPE then you plan to use for your Dev Block. \n\nNo matter what you decide to do the first thing to remember is time. Your Pivot Block will be 1\/3 the length of you Development Block. \n\nFurthermore a Pivot Block should be considered a success if you were able to maintain your peak or only see a bit of a performance decrease. If you\u2019re back really close to where you started at the beginning of your previous Development Block then you know that what you just tried probably isn\u2019t the best idea for a Pivot. \n\nNow that you have finished your first Pivot you have two choices. \n\nOption 1: Hit that Development Block again and see if you have the same response \n\nEDIT: Option 1 may be wrong. I\u2019m not sure why repeating a successful block to retest your response after a washout would be a bad thing. But it seems it\u2019s discussed as a negative in the course. So take this suggestion with a grain of salt. \n\nOption 2:\n\n**Using an Exploration Block**\n\nIf you want to see what else works or if something might work better with a change this is how you do it. \n\nYou\u2019re either going to take a Dev Block that\u2019s worked before and make small tweaks to it (sub out lifts, maybe change how you structure Follow-up Sets, alter RPE targets, etc.) or you\u2019re going to do something extremely different. \n\nWith the first option don\u2019t change a lot, maybe one or two things for each competition\/focus lift. You\u2019re trying to figure out what works and what might work better, fine tuning each successful Dev Block until you think you have it as optimized as it could be. \n\nWith the second option you start from scratch and plan out a whole new Microcycle and see how you respond to that. \n\nEDIT: For clarity. Exploring new ideas is very important. Do not be afraid to try something new and mix it up. It\u2019s important. The point of running something similar again with some tweaks is to see how you respond to those changes. Running a block again as originally designed is to see if you still respond to the same kind of stimulus. The goal there is to be sure that they are your \u201cgreatest hits\u201d and what you can rely on to give you your best response going into a competition. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it. You keep repeating everything until a clearer picture of your responses emerges. \n\nThat\u2019s all Emerging Strategies is. It is simple at its core and complex in its long term application. But there are three things that Mike stresses time and time again:\n\n1. Follow Athlete response. It doesn\u2019t matter if you find you respond to something weird or unconventional. All that matters is that the *majority* of the time you do it you improve. You\u2019re looking for repeatable improvements no matter what causes them. The why doesn\u2019t really matter. \n2. You have permission to try things. You have to experiment to figure out what works best for you. Start with the simplest thing you know works and build from there over time. Focus on the small scale and let the larger picture uncover itself. \n3. Limit the noise. You want to be consistent across as many variables as you possibly can. Change is good, but the effect it has on your performance (however you are choosing to measure that) needs to be easy for you to see. Find a few things to anchor your training around and make these changes around them. Whether it\u2019s movements you know build your main lifts, Rep\/intensity ranges you know you respond well to, or anything else that you can think of. \n\nI could keep going. There\u2019s so much to try to include. \n\nHell, I didn\u2019t even get into planning Follow-up Sets. Who am I kidding, even if I did I\u2019d just be saying \u201cexperiment!\u201d Which seems to be a theme with Mike when people ask him about where to start. Just start somewhere and make informed decisions based on how you respond to things. \n\n*I* picked General Gainz to help me do that. You can pick whatever helps you make better sense of this. Just make sure you know how it works and that it works for *you*. \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget. Once you have a few Dev Blocks that you know work you can start to play with them. Did that one Dev Block only work because of the one before it? What if you run those other two together?\n\nYou get the point.  \n\n**A tongue in cheek TLDR**\n\nPlan a week of training. Don\u2019t change it until you shit the bed for a few weeks. Then do something else for 1-4 weeks. Come back to that week, change something if you think it needs changing and run it again, don\u2019t change anything if you don\u2019t want. Was it better?  The same? Worse? Cool you learned something. If it was shit the first time plan a different week and see what happens. \n\nEDIT: don\u2019t be afraid to really mix it up though! You don\u2019t have to, or necessarily should, repeat a block immedietly. Even if it was a successful block. \n\nRepeat for years until you have a great understanding of how you respond to training. \n\n**A shout out**\n\nMike\/RTS have put together a free training log. It\u2019s amazing and has a block review function that shows you everything about the block of training you choose. It\u2019s amazing and showed me that my first Dev Block had too much shit in it. Every T3 under the sun and simply too much noise for me to really get a good picture of what was helping.  \n\nIt\u2019s useful. It\u2019s free. Give it a shot. \n\n**References**\n\n1. https:\/\/youtu.be\/WdGP120e4B0  \n2. https:\/\/youtu.be\/nUjjzusPAzk  \n3. https:\/\/youtu.be\/G7Qa_z93Q80  \n4. https:\/\/youtu.be\/vKdXY_PovLs  \n5. https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLpUp9eeOLyRefDpiZDWtv8YVIaWDGGvxH  \n6. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/4fVQfXAzArbCsmHiny0Waf?si=uXvkWZorSWO1uDBZBjnXeQ  \n7. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/0I8Kv0vN6LfZlDIfZJ86Sr?si=CFyUvRJ7Q9SnOZL7dudaLA  \n8. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/3InMrwNREqFTScSqXBp2vW?si=ixL8A_h5Snm0sqFQXnhuAA  \n9. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/6XSu4PQEgBYSlqTU4Ama84?si=iiqxJdY4SPqQ83co9qW1gg  \n10. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/7KjujEBP6tsij65Rnr8XQc?si=8lniIdAgTCSpAkjghL9bxw  \n11. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/1mDbshbOEMIMPHQt1jfHD1?si=jDZOoNaGQ42k55SFGAxDBw  \n12. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/13EuTjMhMANcAm7xvQYAFG?si=2YgQ6yyCQC6Wk0rp7Siy2A  \n13. https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/1dVidt9fFNvBfzUKQMRU0s?si=INxKbvWGTyqF7mn7RFkqVQ  \n14. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2022\/06\/02\/how-i-added-129lbs-to-my-total-in-2-blocks\/  \n15. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2021\/06\/08\/note-to-self-remember-the-long-term\/  \n16. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2017\/12\/20\/deloading-effectively  \n17. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2018\/01\/10\/should-you-use-heavy-singles-in-training\/  \n18. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2017\/09\/19\/using-block-reviews  \n19. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2017\/07\/19\/performance-downturns  \n20. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2017\/05\/10\/project-momentum-17-1-results\/  \n21. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2016\/01\/06\/customizing-your-rpe-chart\/  \n22. https:\/\/articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com\/2018\/07\/11\/why-skipping-the-wave-load-might-be-useful\/","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673267827.0},{"title":"Gainit Program Party 2023 - Super Squats Week 1","author":null,"url":"\/r\/gainit\/comments\/107d0o3\/gainit_program_party_2023_super_squats_week_1\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673266992.0},{"title":"January 9 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/10759ms\/january_9_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673240470.0},{"title":"January 8 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/106acdy\/january_8_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673154069.0},{"title":"January 7 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/105gcqw\/january_7_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1673067668.0},{"title":"Fatigue Indicators and how to use them - Juggernaut Training Systems","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/www.jtsstrength.com\/fatigue-indicators-and-how-to-use-them\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673016473.0},{"title":"What SANDBAG WEIGHT is RIGHT for YOU?!?","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r9CGU_PVHaI","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1673024224.0},{"title":"[Meet Report] Strength Tribe End of Year Send \u2013 Sydney, NSW, Aus (622.5kg @ 100kg \u2013 Open)","author":"VladimirLinen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/104gbqb\/meet_report_strength_tribe_end_of_year_send\/","text":"## Summary\n\nPut 20kg on my total at a lower body weight, learned a lot about my training, and could have executed the small things better. \n\n## Takeaways\n\n- Alternating heavy\/light weeks for deadlift result in more consistent performance in training and a large peaking effect on the platform.\n- Starting light for the peak (55% 1RM for sets of 6 for squats, 65% for sets of 6 for bench) felt much easier to execute and resulted in very crisp movement patterns. We can maintain technical proficiency with heavier close variations, like Close Stance High Bar squats.\n- Bench needs more technical focus earlier in the peak, either with comp pauses or Spoto, to make sure I can express my strength on the day.\n- Running all assistance with a 2020 tempo meant I felt less beat up and fatigued without any strength loss.\n\n## Background\n\nI\u2019m a 6\u20192\u201d lifter who oscillates between 95-105kg depending on how well I can sweet talk my fiance into letting me gain weight. My previous best total was [603kg at 104.1kg](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/jwmkui\/meet_report_paragon_open_sydney_nsw_aus_603kg\/). I\u2019ve been lifting seriously for 6 years, with the last two under a coach. \n\n# Training\n\nI had 16 weeks to prep for this meet. The training was linear periodisation with a heavy focus on technique. I had four main training days a week with optional extra days I put in for LISS cardio or more intense conditioning (TaBEARta, AMRAP Armour Building Complexes). The main lifting days had 5-6 sets of the comp movement followed by 5-7 assistance movements with 3 sets each. We progressed each week by adding weight to the main movements and used a pretty simple double progression for assistance. \n\nThis looked a little something like this:\n\n| Day 1 | Day 2 [optional] | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 [optional] | Day 6 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Volume Comp Squat  | Tempo Circuit \/ Cardio | Heavy \/ Light Deadlift | Heavy Squat Variation | Conditioning | Heavy Comp Squat  |\n| Volume Bench |  | Volume Front Squat | Comp Bench |  | Lunges + Pull + Abs Assistance |\n| Push + Abs Assistance |  | Pull + Abs Assistance | Bench Variation  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Push + Abs Assistance |  |  |\n\nI treated the optional cardio and conditioning days as life stress \u201crelease valves\u201d. If work got too intense, and it did a couple of times during prep, I cut the conditioning and cardio days to maximise recovery.\n\n### Squat\n\nWe squatted 4 days a week with heavier and lighter days and variations to manage recovery. Two things really helped my historically weak squat this prep \u2013 properly bracing and rooting my feet and Close Stance High Bar. \n\n- We put a lot of work into my bracing mechanics this prep, with lots of oblique work and 90\/90 breathing before each session. I also stumbled across u\/BigCoachD\u2019s idea of rooting feet into the ground a few weeks into prep which helped squats to click.\n- We used a Close Stance High Bar for my heavy squat variation (sets of 2-5 reps). This variation felt like one of the [\u201cmagic exercises\u201d](https:\/\/peakhd.net\/p\/uyp) Ben Pollack talks about in Unfuck Your Program. Week to week, I could put more weight on the bar at the same RPE, and my squat form and confidence carried over to my comp lifts. Why? Not sure, but I think it rewards driving hard through your quads and maintaining torso positioning throughout the lift.\n\nMy best training lift was a 220kg squat, and a 210kg peaking single that moved pretty well. \n\n### Bench Press\n\nWe benched twice a week. We did two things here:\n\n- I\u2019m a very pec-dominant bencher (chest grows like a weed, triceps don\u2019t) which means occasionally I run the risk of pec tweaks if my training volume and intensity get too high (80+ total reps over 80% in a training block) and I flare my elbows too much. I was just coming off one such tweak, so we opted for a heavy DB bench for my main movement and used comp bench for volume.\n- We also used Close Grip Incline Bench, which felt like another \u201cmagic exercise\u201d. It works my weak areas, like front delts and triceps, and forces me to drive through my elbows.\n\nWe kept bench intensity pretty conservative through prep, and my best training lift was a 145kg single. \n\n### Deadlift\n\nThis is where things get unique. We\u2019ve found in the past I don\u2019t respond well to a high RPE deadlift session each week. It leads to technique breakdown and excessive erector fatigue. Instead, we use an alternating progression with one heavy week for lower reps, and one lighter week for volume. At least one of those weeks is a variation. We use my baes Snatch Grip Deadlift or Deficit Deadlifts as variations. This prep looked like this:\n\n- For the first 12 weeks, we did a heavy, lower rep snatch grip week followed by a lighter deficit week where I just slammed volume (6 sets of 12 reps, for example)\n- For the last 4 weeks, we switched to alternating weeks of heavy and light cluster singles of comp deadlifts.\n\nI\u2019d missed a 240kg pull at the start of prep, but deadlifts never let me down, and my best training lifts were a 240kg pull at RPE 8 and a 220kg Snatch Grip double. I finally remembered how to slack pull about 3 weeks out which was helpful.\n\n## Assistance\n\nAlmost all assistance in this prep was done with a 2020 tempo because my coach ~~hates me~~ was sick of me rushing my lifts. All the usual suspects like back extensions, pulldowns, DB OHP, and ab wheels were in. This was cool because we could drop the intensity of assistance while still getting stronger, which helped with recovery. \n\n## Nutrition\n\nI started at a lean 95kg and steadily gained weight up to 100kg over 6 months (including meet prep) for an average weight gain of about .2kg a week. I follow a standard high carb, moderate protein, low fat macro split, and got up to 4,200 calories a day by the end of prep. This was usually 200gm protein, 60-70gm fats, and the rest into carbs. \n\n## Prep\n\nThings were going fantastically well for the first 10 weeks, and my technique was looking the best it ever has. Then I had to get a suspicious mole cut out of my shoulder (thanks to spending all summer at Australian beaches when I was younger) which took two weeks to recover from. That left about 5 weeks to remember how to lift and regain my technique, which was a bit tricky. Overall, I felt really good the whole prep, and even the peaking phase didn\u2019t floor me too hard. \n\nI also found a few guys in my gym who were also competing, so we created a little training crew. This made prep really fun, and I\u2019d highly recommend doing the same if you can. \n\n# The Day\n\nIt was a pretty casual meet with no weigh-ins, so we got there early and started eating carbs and drinking energy drinks. \n\n### Squat\n\nWarmups were feeling a bit whack. I was strong, but I couldn\u2019t stay upright and kept falling forward. \n\n- [205kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=96s) I have a rule to always fist bump my spotters on my first to thank them and make sure they\u2019re paying attention to me in case they need to save my butt.\n- [212.5kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=6418s) Again, you can see I\u2019m a bit wonky here.\n- [220kg \u2013 Miss.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=7035s) Not happy at all with this. The spotters did a good job keeping me safe, but I was strong enough to squat this weight, just not technically good enough, and I knew it.\n\nI took five minutes outside to go sulk, then pulled myself back together and decided just to make sure I had fun for the rest of the meet. \n\n### Bench\n\nWarmups felt good, if a bit heavy, so we decided to open light and see where we could get to. \n\n- [140kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=12668s) Ez pz.\n- [150kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=13260s) Best 150kg has ever moved, so we took another big jump. This is where I started having fun again. I was a bit nervous about keeping my leg drive on and my butt down, but we decided to go for a little PR.\n- [157.5kg \u2013 Miss.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=13957s) Almost got this one, just lost my leg drive and tension which meant I couldn\u2019t grind it out.\n\n### Deadlift\n\nDeadlift never lets me down. \n\n- [230kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=18535s) Moved quick.\n- [250kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=19060s) Moved as fast as 230kg. Coach asked if I wanted to load 270kg, but I just wanted to make a third and PR my total, so we went for the safe option of 260kg.\n- [260kg \u2013 Make.](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/770074820#t=19693s) Should have put 270kg on, but you can see how relieved I was to match a PR in comp and make my first third of the day.  Also I absolutely burned my spotter for a fist bump.\n\n# Lessons\n\n### Squat\n\n- The only thing I can think of for squats was I trained in socks and competed in shoes. This was a rookie mistake of not trying my shoes earlier. I felt like they were too small and jammed my toes together, meaning I couldn\u2019t root my feet properly.\n- Feels like we\u2019ve finally got to a progression scheme that works for squats, and it\u2019s on me to keep working on bracing, foot rooting and executing on meet day. And to get new shoes.\n\n### Bench\n\n- I need more technical exposure earlier in the peak (Spoto, Long Pause). I was strong enough to bench 157.5kg, just not technically good enough.\n- 150kg moved the best it\u2019s ever moved on the platform, which means just about everything else is working.\n\n### Deadlift\n\n- I can rely on a pretty decent peaking effect coming into the meet. Last meet, I pulled 235kg at RPE 9 in training, then pulled 250kg in comp and 260kg the next week. This meet, I pulled 240kg at RPE 8 then pulled 260kg easily in comp and 270kg the week after. Meet day often results in a deadlift 15-20kg higher than my training would suggest.\n- Literally change nothing about deadlift training, I have full faith I can keep chugging along.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672967403.0},{"title":"January 6 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/104lbpd\/january_6_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1672981268.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/104qf75\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1672999269.0},{"title":"Visualization Strategies For Hitting PRs - Reactive Training Systems","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fdeVycBt85o","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672935438.0},{"title":"January 5 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/103q4vs\/january_5_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672894870.0},{"title":"How to Cut Water Weight the Right Way - Renaissance Periodization","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/jn9g_zR935I","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1672863217.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Conventional Deadlift","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/1031xrb\/weakpoint_wednesday_conventional_deadlift\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

[Mythicals 10000 swings in 7 days]( http:\/\/mythicalstrength.blogspot.com\/2022\/08\/eat-big-elephant-first-10000-kettlebell.html), was what inspired me to try and do it in 5 days. After all, 2000 swings in a day doesn\u2019t seem that bad. I was wrong. I severely underestimated how long this would take, and how much it would suck.\n\n#Execution\nI started on Christmas eve, and got through 700-ish in one go before I my hamstrings were torched and I needed a break. I finished the other 300-ish over the course of the day. This was awful, and I switched to 10 days of 1000 swings, since that seemed more doable. On day 2 I hit all of the swings in 1:03:06, which was awful. But doing it in one go meant I had the whole day to recover and not think about swings. On day 5 I did my best time of 46:24, after which I stopped trying to best my times and simply focused on not dying and keeping my times under 50 minutes.  \n\nI started off with however many I got, then realized I needed to change my plan if I wanted to make it through this, so I switched to sets of 25. This made math easier since it was just 40 sets. Final switch was to sets of 30, doing 32 sets of 30 and one set of 40 at the end. I stuck with that one till the end because I\u2019m lazy and didn\u2019t try and push for times. \n\nThe weight used was 20kgs, because that\u2019s the heaviest kettlebell I have at home and it\u2019s close enough to 24kg recommended. \n\nIt reminded me a lot of Deep water squats, and the endless sets in that nightmare. The swings are never ending; you\u2019re always doing swings and there\u2019s always more to do. This makes it feel quite hopeless, and you can either quit or just keep your head down and keep doing the work. It\u2019ll be over at some point.\nI did not do any extra conditioning or extra lifting, just swings. I probably could\u2019ve done some, but I felt lazy and didn\u2019t want to bother.\n\n#NOTES\n\u2022\tDespite my hamstrings feeling like they\u2019ve been beaten with a bat, I didn\u2019t have any problems with hamstring soreness\n\n\u2022\tDoing it in one go is the way to go in my opinion, having to do swings through the day always felt worse, could never rest properly since swings were on my mind. \n\n\u2022\tHeadbands are almost a need, otherwise the sweat will start to ruin the higher rep sets. \n\n\u2022\tI solved the issue of skin and hand problems by wrapping a resistance band around the handle. I\u2019m not quite sure why, but it worked really well. \n\n\u2022\tThis will turn your metabolism into a furnace. Feels like I could digest a rock in a few hours. \n\n\u2022\tAround day 7 I realized this was simply a challenge done for the sake of the challenge. \n\n\u2022\tI had a small worry that not training anything but swings would result in that fabled muscle loss that everyone keep talking about. I did not lose any muscle, and in fact look the same as I did before doing the challenge. This was rather reassuring that I could take a big detour and not worry about muscle loss\n\n\u2022\tThere was a strange feeling of solitude while doing swings. It was just me and the kettlebell, and endless swings. \n\n\u2022\tDoing a 1000 swings after new year\u2019s was an experience. I slept 4 crappy hours and was still a bit drunk. The detoxing effect was quite surprising, after the swings, some protein and a nap I felt quite normal. \n\n\u2022\tLast workout (2nd of January) marked 1 year of training every day. I did not plan for this, but it was a nice coincidence. \n\n#CONCLUSION\n[Swing a little more, on the Devil\u2019s Dance Floor]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OboGTtdOUfw)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672676786.0},{"title":"Brian Alsruhe's Strongman Powerbuilding","author":"TheAesir","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/101kgqb\/brian_alsruhes_strongman_powerbuilding\/","text":"# Intro \/ Training History\n\nI have done 3 strongman comps since 2021 (2 open shows, 1 SC level 1 show which was basically a novice event). I got back into training after a multi year hiatus in January of 2020. I've seen varying level of success around having two young kids (3 and 17 months), and the issues that come with that. I feel like I've had some pretty decent jumps in strength, but some pretty long periods of stagnation \/ regression. I've spent the bulk of the last 3 years running variants of SBS and mainly picking the wrong accessories to drive both my barbell and compound movements.\n\nAfter a disappointing showing at my comp in August, I decided to go another way. I ended up taking 13 weeks to run a 9 week program  (not counting the deload and testing week) because of Covid, and another virus that laid me up for several days (you think you're immune to disease, and then you have kids, and you'll be sick more in the first couple years than you were cumulative in the last decade).\n\n\n\n# The Program\n\nThe program is broken down into 4 waves. 3 waves of concurrent training blocks with increasing percentages each wave, and then a 3 week testing block (which I skipped). There are four days to each training week, 2 upper and 2 lower, each focusing on a different main lift.\n\n1. Deadlift (Elevated deadlift, axle deadlift, comp deadlift)\n2. Overhead (Log, Axle, Circus DB)\n3. Squat (SSB or High Bar, Squat, Front Squat \/ Zercher)\n4. Bench (Close Grip, Floor Press, Log Incline or Bench)\n\nEach of these days falls into one of three categories, that rotates each week\n\n* Power\n* Hypertrophy\n* Speed and Endurance\n\nThe program utilizes reverse pyramid progressions on 3 working sets, the last of which is an amrap. Each week is a different variation of the movement (as I detailed above). There is a focus on giant sets (duh), short rest times (duh), and general athletics. Strongman implements were also used in a lot of creative ways, which I appreciated.\n\n# Before \/ After\n\n## Body Weight\n\n* Start weight: 215\n* Peak: 221\n* Current: 215\n\nI spent most of the year (February until mid December) bulking up (sloppily) from 200 to 221. I started cutting in mid December\n\n## Deadlift\n\nMy deadlift has been really underwhelming this year. I pulled 545 in August last year and it's basically been trash since.\n\n| Movement | TM Start | Best Set \n|-|-|-|-|\n| 13\" deadlift | missed 475 | 525 x 2\n| Deadlift | 500 | 475 x 5 (RPE 9) \n|  Axle Deadlift | 500 | 400 x 8\n\n\n## Overhead\n\n- I ended up doing axle work on week 3  as well instead of CDB. \n- I was really struggling with heavier weights on the initial testing, but managed to make it through the program using my all time bests as the training maxes.\n\n| Movement | TM Start | Best Set \n|-|-|-|-|\n| Log | 240 | 225 x 3 C&P every rep\n| Axle | 250 | 225 x 5 C&P x3 and press away last two reps\n\n## Squat\n\nI haven't actually done a straight bar squat since 2017. So that was new on this cycle. I set it initially at the same TM as my detrained SSB.\nMy SSB has been mostly stagnant this year. Overall I felt like my training maxes were on the low side. It'll be interesting to see how things compare in another run through \n\n| Movement | TM Start | Best Set \n|-|-|-|-|\n| SSB | 400 | 430 x 1, 400x3\n| Back Squat | 400 | 455x1 (missed 485 in the hole)\n| Front Squat | 365 | 335 x 3\n\n## Bench\n\nI didn't train any variations on bench until the 3rd wave, so no initial TM's. I don't have a bench in my home gym currently\n\n| Movement | TM Start | Best Set \n|-|-|-|-|\n| Floor Press | 315 | 325x1, 305x3\n| Close Grip | | 315x1\n\n## Implements\n\n| Movement | Best Set \n|-|-|-|-|\n| Farmers | 275lbs per hand for 50ft\n| Sandbag Carry | 10x 50ft runs with a 250lb bag\n| Sandbag Over Shoulder | 6 x 220\n| 1 mile farmers carry | 26 minutes\n| Static sandbag hold | 1 minute @ 220lbs\n\n## Other Notable \n\n| Movement | Best Set | Notes\n|-|-|-|-|\n| Chin-ups | +100lbs x 3 | +25lbs in weight + 6lbs in bodyweight\n| Mostly strict Pendlay Row | 315 x 3 | Up from 285x3 pre covid\n\n# Thoughts\n\n## Initial thoughts\n\nAs I noted above, I started this right out of a bad bout with covid. So I ended up running wave 1 twice. Halfway through wave 2, my daughter brought home some other respiratory virus and got me sick again... joy. I missed a 13\" deadlift at 475lbs on the first day of the first wave. I couldn't hold my 175lb sandbag for 30 seconds... it was just yeah, a rough first 3 weeks.\n\nMy ability to carry and load sandbags is infinitely better than when I started. I still suck at throwing them over my shoulder, but even that's coming along.\n\nThe mindset challenges were tough, to say the least. Carrying 45lbs in your hand doesn't seem daunting, until you're trying to do it for a mile.\n\n## What I Changed\n\n* I made a few adjustments to get around equipment issues. For example I didn't have a yoke when I started, so the 3x yoke walks were programmed I did extra farmers. In place of overhead yoke walks I generally did axle push presses into static holds.\n* Somewhere in my second run of the first wave I started working up and doing the amraps first, and using the higher rep sets and backoff work on the days main movement. Quality of reps dramatically improved, and I was able to get a little bit of extra work in on the way up.\n\n## What I liked\n\n* Conjugation of movements really helped keep things feeling fresh.\n* The entire program is just a brutal annihilation of your upper back and hamstrings. The last couple of weeks, I had to flip the bench and overhead days just to get enough of a break.\n* There was very little strict pressing in the conventional sense, and yet I don't think my shoulders have ever put on this much mass in a 12 week span.\n* Use of implements to help build up weaknesses. Rather than doing endless sets of RDLs, that someone like Bromley would recommend, there was a lot more focus on sandbag work. Carries, over shoulder, more carries, loads.\n* Core work every training session\n* Focus on being a better athlete in general\n\n## What I didn't Like\n\n* I had weeks where I was really struggling with my continentals. I imagine it would have been even worse if I wasn't doing them 2 out of the 3 week waves. It was the one piece of skill work that I felt like didn't get enough attention.\n* There was days that I really wanted more repetition on the main movements, but given time constraints of working and being a parent I didn't always have the time to spend getting in extra sets like I might have on SBS.\n\n# What's Next\n\n* April 1st comp in Oklahoma\n* Running another 10 week block, but tweaking it to get come more comp specific movements in","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1672685993.0},{"title":"[Program Party] Super Squats 2023 - Sign up post","author":null,"url":"\/r\/gainit\/comments\/1019han\/program_party_super_squats_2023_sign_up_post\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1672655512.0},{"title":"January 2 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/1013va1\/january_2_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672635670.0},{"title":"January 1 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/100cayj\/january_1_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672549270.0},{"title":"December 31 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zzlxj9\/december_31_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672462869.0},{"title":"[Program Review] Jon Anderson's Deep Water Beginner","author":"turnejam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zz9lti\/program_review_jon_andersons_deep_water_beginner\/","text":"tl;dr: Ow, but good ow.\n\n# Intro\/Training History:\n\nMy goal here is to start things off dry and numbers-focused and provide more color (read: rambling thoughts) towards the end so those who just want the facts can get in and get out. The program itself has been frequently summarized on this subreddit so I'm not going to do it here.\n\nEverything's in lbs.\n\nMe: 34 yr\/old male, 6'2\", lifting weights 6 years total but 3-4 focused on the basic barbell lifts. When COVID hit, I had no gym for 2 years and, though I kept up some sort of base with running and calisthenics, I lost a lot off of my big lifts. Built it back up and then some with Building the Monolith, SBS 2.0 RTF, Bullmastiff, John Meadows's Warlock, and various 5\/3\/1 templates until November of this year.\n\nI decided to run Deep Water because I wanted some sort of lifting-related goal to reach by year's end (plus something that would give all of the holiday calories somewhere useful to go).\n\n# Before\/After:\n\n**Before (Nov 14):**\n\nWeight: **187.9**\n\nS\/B\/D\/Ohp (tested): **385\/250\/455\/155**\n\n**After (Dec 23):**\n\nWeight: **190.5**\n\nS\/B\/D\/Ohp (e1rm): **400\/255\/525(horseshit)\/150**\n\n*FYI, I am going to come back after testing next week and update these numbers. Estimators have been fairly accurate in the past for pressing but lower body and especially deadlifts are often off. Even so, highest I've ever gotten before on a deadlift e1rm was 505 and I can tell I'm way stronger.*\n\n# Diet\/Recovery:\n\nJon has a pretty strong POV--high protein and fat, only incidental carbs. I did not follow his ideas to the letter but I definitely kept carbs far lower than I have on previous bulks. Lots of red meat and nut butters and cooking fats. Generally was able to keep it pretty clean besides Thanksgiving week.\n\nI'll go into more thoughts about diet later on, but I gotta say this approach worked well. Especially if eating clean, it's easier to get all those extra calories you'll need from fats than from carbs. My stomach felt a LOT more comfortable than it had on high-carb bulks.\n\nIn terms of recovery, did a good job of getting 8+ hours of sleep. Lots of hot baths, LOTS of walks, lots of conditioning sessions.\n\n# Variation:\n\n**\\*\\*Weight selection**: Jon recommends what amount to about 54% of 1rm for the working weights. I upped it to what amounted to about 70% on several of the lifts, and this worked well for me. I'll explain more below.\n\nI did a good deal more conditioning than the program asks for. Nothing insane or structured--20 minute incline treadmill walks, bear complex finishers, 5mins of burpees, and the like. Often in the mornings or midday before lunch. Added more back volume on the Bench day with some supersetted pullups and rows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk. Hopefully that was quick enough. Now onto some longer and loosely structured...\n\n# ...Rambling Thoughts:\n\n**\\*\\*About the weights used**\n\n* After 4 sets into day 1, my gut was telling me I could put more on the bar (I had 205). I had no doubt I was going to get some good training effect, but I wouldn't be testing my limits. In other words, it wouldn't be what I understand Deep Water to be. So, I started adding weight to the bar every 2 sets or so, hunting for that gut sensation of \"okay, this is going to be scary.\" I finally got there on set 9 with 275 on the bar, then did extra sets for a total of 15 sets that first day to the point I felt drained and nervous. Same thing happened more or less for deadlifts.\n* I attribute all this to a few things:\n   * My top-end strength and technique likely sucks and 54% would be enough for a lifter who could achieve better singles.\n   * I'd been squatting every single day in October, and frequently sets of 20-25, so my lower body was just in a particularly great spot for some high-volume work.\n   * I entered into this in some of the best conditioning of my life.\n* My takeaway and advice--for what little it's worth--is that this program is written to set up a confrontation between you and you, and I'd recommend changing percentages either way to make that experience real. I ended the first two-week block about 85% sure I could do the next two weeks and about 60% sure I could do the last two, which felt personally right.\n\n**The Program**\n\n* Mondays are the real star of the show here. I honestly didn't find the other days anything to write home about--though do you need more to write home about? I will say bench day was more effective than I thought it would be. 3 sets of to-failure dips will be making appearances in my future accessory work for sure.\n* Strict press days were the most frustrating, and I honestly lowered the weight for the last block. There's something about the big lower body lifts where I could just keep mentally pushing through perceived limits, but at a certain point my shoulder muscles just kinda crapped out and that was that.\n* 10x10 deadlifts were a fucking revelation. I had it in my head that deads (my favorite lift, btw) were a great developer and expresser of overall strength but not much for hypertrophy on their own. I usually wake up after a deadlift day with DOMS in my glutes and occasionally some in my erectors and forearms. EVERYTHING was lit up after this. Hamstrings, rhomboids, traps, lats... fucking *calves*. \n* Speaking of DOMS, it wasn't too brutal but it was *complete* in a way I hadn't experienced. Like, usually some section of my glute is sore the day after squats, but here the whole booty was tender. The very high volume created a very complete training effect which was exciting.\n* The 3x10 barbell lunges were actually what I hated the most. I think its because there's something that feels inherently motivating about counting down 10 big sets... and then instead of celebrating you're confronted with more work.\n\n**The Physical**\n\n* This was the easiest (deliberate and desired) weight gain I've ever experienced. I never ate to the point of discomfort, but the pounds steadily added. Thank you nut butters, and thank you lower body volume that simply *demands* more food.\n* In fact, I was READY for every bite I ate. This is the only time in my life where I've woken up at 3AM and had to eat some nut butter and protein so that I could go back to sleep. Some days I felt like a horror movie monster driven by a dull bottomless hunger.\n* I actually had to cut weight for something between weeks 4 and 5, and entered into those final squats at 184lbs. It's a long and complicated story that I may talk about in the comments, but the point is I could have easily gained more quality mass if I'd been able to be more consistent.\n* Booty and legs exploded. Smaller but noticeable effect on arms, chest, and upper back.\n* I did gain some fluff, but I think it was from the shitty eating and beer drinking at holiday parties. During the weeks I was clean on both counts, my body was absolutely looking tighter even as the scale was going up.\n* As the famous mythicalstrength has repeatedly said, conditioning is an investment that pays dividends into every other aspect of your lifting and physique journey. It's so good.\n* Can I get on my soapbox about this newfangled thing called Walking? Extended walks should not be overlooked and have really helped my mind, my joints, my muscle recovery, and my digestion. Movement is medicine, no matter how humble.\n\n**The Mental**\n\n* Jon Anderson instructs you to \"find *your* portals,\" and however you get through the sets is probably going to be pretty individual. That said, I found any sort of self-talk unhelpful. Saying things like \"you can do it,\" \"just one more set,\" \"you gotta do this for X reason,\" etc. just starts a conversation going in my head, and that conversation can turn into a negotiation, and then I'm fucked. \"This is simply happening, end of discussion\" is generally the right way for me.\n   * Side note: I have OCD, and I was taught in therapy that reassurance can actually reinforce the idea in your brain that there is something that requires reassurance.  In other words, \"you can do this\" implies the possibility of a \"this\" that may not be doable. Again, particular to me, but hopefully helpful or interesting to others.\n* Going outside of the head, simply approaching the bar like I was fresh and excited was a huge help. I was surprised at how often I could make set 8 better than set 5 by acting like it was going to be.\n* This will be surprising to some, but I found this program so mentally refreshing and actually looked forward to every Deep Water day. Part of this is the program is simply very unique. Squatting and deadlifting every other week, using time density rather than weight to progress... it's so different than what I've been doing the last couple of years and it really kept me engaged. For that reason alone I wholeheartedly recommend it as a shakeup program to anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOof, that was long. I only hope that there are nuggets here and there that are helpful to the community.

I indirectly wrote this when I was helping out my Dad approach conditioning work in his home gym. This is also a self-accountability post, as I'm going to focus more on my own conditioning going forward.\n\nThis is largely a bastardized distillation of what \/u\/MythicalStrength has taught me through his posts and Book of Bad Ideas. **I am explicitly writing this for the lifter that is mostly focused on bodybuilding and\/or powerlifting, and not so much for CrossFitters (since this will already be something they are acutely aware of!).**\n\nI'll keep this as simple as possible! I see two main styles of conditioning sessions, \"finishers\" and longer form workouts I prefer to do on off-days. Circuits are a recurring theme here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Session Types\n---\n\n**\"Finishers\"**: 5-10 minute burnout style circuits to throw in after finishing traditional workouts.\n\nBase formats:\n\n1. EMOM (every minute on the minute). Usually involving one to three movements.\n2. Tabata (20s on, 10s rest; 8 rounds). Usually just one main movement.\n\n\n**\"Off-day Sessions\"**: longer form (10-40 minute) circuits that I prefer to do on \"off-days\" to aid in recovery and build capacity.\n\nBase formats:\n\n1. EMOM (again, per above)\n2. Reps for time: Complete a set number of reps as fast as possible, allowing rest along the way. Classic example being the *Grace* WOD.\n3. Total rounds for time: Complete a fixed number of total sets as fast as possible, allowing rest between each set. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Movement Selection\n---\n\nYou have a lot of options here, but I suggest picking things that involve large amounts of movement (burpees being king). Per MythicalStrength, you can also pick lifts you want to practice or simply want to squeeze in. There are no rules here -- just get your heart rate up and do some work.\n\nSome additional perspective from the man himself:\n> I'd say something worth discussing is the significance of level changes (going from standing to the floor and back again) as it relates to getting a heart rate up. That's a big part of the reason the burpee is what it is. It was Brian Alsruhe that turned me on to burpees in that regard, explaining how tons of people die each year simply because they fall down and can't get back up again, making the burpee a lifesaving skill. I was sold then. And then you can do things like Turkish get ups or sprawl drills or other level changes.\n\nMy favorites (sort of in order of preference):\n\n* Burpees: **terrible and will likely be the glue in any circuit when in doubt**\n* Picking a weight\/bar off the ground and putting it over your head\n* Sled push\n* Pull-ups \n* Ski Erg\n* Swings\n* Most compound lifts (not bench lol)\n \n\n## Where to Start\n---\n\nStart with quick finishers like EMOM burpees. You don't need to absolutely murder yourself every single session, either. But with time, it's helpful to aim for huffing and puffing for at least some of your sessions to push your capacity. \n\nFrom there, think about circuits that have two or more movements, as well as longer form sessions. \n\n## Additional Reading from MythicalStrength\n---\n\n* [Conditioning is Magic](https:\/\/mythicalstrength.blogspot.com\/2021\/11\/conditioning-is-magic.html)\n* [Conditioning is the Answer](http:\/\/mythicalstrength.blogspot.com\/2022\/03\/conditioning-is-answer.html)\n* [Book of Bad Ideas \\(PDF\\)](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1dE8hMSQdnWTzwOitrJjzJq2EeZ4ZzoJT\/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHope this is useful!","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672353199.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zywuvm\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1672394469.0},{"title":"December 30 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zyrk03\/december_30_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672376471.0},{"title":"13 Weeks of a combination of Mag\/Ort & nSuns","author":"yyyolo197","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zy6vth\/13_weeks_of_a_combination_of_magort_nsuns\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nStats: Still a 19M at 5'11\n\nSo, I have completed the 12 week Mag\/Ort program for both deadlifts and squats, keeping to nSuns for the upper body lifts: OHP and bench press.

To say the least, Mag\/Ort was a decent run for the squats and deadlifts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Initial 1rm|Ending 1rm|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Body Weight|82kg|85kg|\n|Squat (Mag\/Ort)|140kg|155kg|\n|Bench (nSuns)|90kg|95kg (or 85kg for 6 reps)|\n|Deadlifts (Mag\/Ort)|195kg|210kg|\n|Strict OHP (nSuns)|65kg|67.5kg (or 60kg for 5 reps)|\n\n**MODIFICATIONS**\n\n* Deadlifts after Mag\/Ort Squats, warming up to a solid RPE 7\/8. Not going overboard\n* Squats before Mag\/Ort deadlifts.\n* I didn't always increase the weight 5kg week-to-week, sometimes 7.5kg or 2.5kg. For example, if I have a double at 197.5kg for deadlifts, I would just round it to 195kg or 200kg. I doubt the body knows the difference 2.5kg makes on a deadlift.\n* Introducing push press, I would try a top single push press right before my OHP AMRAP+ top set. I think I will continue this lift, kinda like it.\n* Slight increase in the OHP volume.\n* Much less focus on accessories. \n* Spread volume of nSuns bench across more sessions, increasing the frequency.\n\n15kg extra on both the deadlift and the squat in \\~13 weeks. Running nSuns for another 13 weeks, I gained a 5kg increase in both the bench and the OHP. During my rest weeks, I still kept to my old habit, of going for a top single of RPE 8\/9 for the respective lifts. The last few sessions, haven't been too pretty, however. I found myself failing a few top sets for the squats and deadlifts and having to grind through an RPE 10, balls to the wall, rep. Recently, I was to get a top double on 150kg for squats, I failed 5 times to get that second rep in the session. Absolute tunnel-vision, was not a good move to be honest. A session of only repeatedly failing. Tried it again, the next week, instead of going up to a 155kg double. Thinking about it now, I failed quite a lot during the last half of the 2 programs. Even for the bench, I failed a 2 plate attempt, many times. Failed a 70kg strict press a few times. I think all this was a combination of entering my actual 1rms instead of my training maxes (90% of 1rm), not eating enough in the last few weeks, stress of balancing studying for exams and working. I still keep sleep a priority however at 7 hours minimum. Right now, I just feel very sore and tired, especially in my lower back, wrists and knees. Feel like an old man. \n\nIt's exam season, so I will probably just rest for the next 2 or so weeks and focus on these exams. Once it comes around to mid-January, I will definitely switch programs for deadlifts and squats. I will definitely keep intensity at the core of my training, just a personal preference and I think it works. I realised switching from nSuns to Mag\/Ort has sort of 'desensitised' me to higher rep squats and deadlifts. I remember trying to get 20 reps on that last nSuns AMRAP set of squats most sessions. Conditioning has gone down a bit for higher rep tolerances. I will try to find or change a program to be able to squat at least x2, OHP\/bench x2-3 and deadlift x1.\n\n Overall, 2022 was a good year of lifting, especially post April, since starting nSuns (previous program post), but I think all the constant PRing has caught up to me. Need to train a little smarter this year, and not max out as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Goals for 2023|\n|:-|:-|\n|Body weight|90-95kg (+5-10kg increase)|\n|Squat|200kg (+45kg increase)|\n|Bench |110kg (+15kg increase)|\n|Deadlift |240kg (+30kg increase)|\n|Strict OHP |80kg (+12.5kg increase)|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think these 2023 goals are very conservative in my opinion, especially considering that I will allow my body to grow up to 95kg at the highest. Another thing I need to focus on this year however, is the cardio aspect of fitness. I've noticed, embarrassingly that I am usually dripping in sweat, whilst I am still doing my deadlift warm up sets. Also, neglecting accessories, mean some of my muscle groups like biceps are lagging behind a lot, I have very skinny arms lol. I will also focus on growing more mass on my chest and triceps, specifically to increase my poverty bench. I think the lack of chest\/tricep mass is a big reason, why my bench is rubbish.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1672324630.0},{"title":"GZCL - Swole at Every Height - \"Your Baseline\"","author":"DadliftsnRuns","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zxgz42\/gzcl_swole_at_every_height_your_baseline\/","text":"In his latest blog post, Cody Lefever (\/u\/GZCL) discusses the importance of building a broad base, and not just judging your abilities based on your best days, but also on your average days, and your worst days.\n\nHow he incorporates this mindset with his daily (1300+ days!) of consecutive training, and how it has made him stronger and fitter all around.\n\nI absolutely loved this post, because it provides a bunch of confirmation bias (lol) towards how my own perspective has evolved on training. \n\nFor example, my conventional deadlift 1RM may be weaker than it was a year and a half ago, but after running obscene mileage over the last 12 months, I can go into the gym and hit ~85-90% of that on any given day, and then immediately go out and run, or lift, or shovel snow, or climb a mountain, or play with my children, because that base, that work capacity, has expanded so much. \n\nMy peak strength may have diminished, but my base strength, my ability to perform on any given day, has drastically increased\n\n\n[Here is the link to his post](https:\/\/swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com\/2022\/12\/your-baseline.html?m=1&fbclid=PAAaYuaUmSxRBfUgcF8XejHDMXYwJV0CDUJq47Yr6C4nph6jKHWXHVXPSJpP8)\n\nIt's absolutely worth a read for everyone","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672252155.0},{"title":"December 29 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zxwcd7\/december_29_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1672290069.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Sumo Deadlift","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zx7u3z\/weakpoint_wednesday_sumo_deadlift\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

As most people I've started with doing my own thing arranged from watching different \"Best workout for X bodypart\" video every day and piecing them together. After about half a year of that I did PHUL, then [this PPL](https:\/\/www.muscleandstrength.com\/workouts\/6-day-powerbuilding-split-meal-plan), then Deep Water, Super Squats, [Minimalist equipment program detailed here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gainit\/comments\/nubqv9\/progress_pring_every_session_after_5_months_off\/), Deep Water and Super Squats again all while gaining weight until I was ~85kg, then I did a cut down to the starting point of this following this sub's SBS program party.\n\n# Starting point\n\nAs I've just said, I was going into this from a cut that also ended with macing out on squat,bench, deadlift and ohp. I've put my PRs into the table above, but it might be worth noting that my deadlift was the only one of those that increased while my squat fell down during the cut and pressing movements stayed the same. \n\n# The program\n\nThe program consists of four smaller programs - 531 Beefcake, 531 Building the Monolith, Jon Andersen's Deep Water Beginner and Jon Andersen's Deep Water Intermediate, so my write up will also consist of four parts.\n\n**Beefcake**\n\nI've made some changes to the program:\n - I'd do PR sets on the main work. I did it simply because I didn't know that it was recommended otherwise. \n - On the bench and ohp days, I'd superset rows with the main work too, using the exact percentages and prescribed reps (i.e. PR sets) for them too using a row training max (two different maxes specifically, since I was doing strict Pendlay rows on OHP days and Yates rows on bench days)\n\nMain and supplemental work was otherwise done as written. I was able to get the 5x10 work done in 20 minutes every day except the very last deadlift day. \n\nOn upper body days as assisatnce work I'd do 50 chins\/50 dips\/50 band assisted nordic curls the first week and I'd add 10 each week until 100s on the last week\n\nOn lower body days as assistance work I'd do barbell bulgarian split squats and GHD situps. On a 5s week I'd do 4x12, on a 3s week I'd do 5x10 and on a 1s week I'd do 6x8 with the weight getting heavier as reps per set got lower.\n\nFor conditioning I'd do 20 minutes of running on the lower body days and random WOD by a random WOD app on upper body days. Once a week on a day I wouldn't otherwise got to the gym I'd do a workout consisting of 10 rounds of\n - 25m Zercher carry\n - 25m overhead dumbbell carry\nstarting at 5 minutes per round and lowering that by 15s every week until 3 minutes per round, when I'd up the weight a bit and go back to 5 min rounds\n\n**Building the Monolith**\n\nMain work was done as written. I failed on the 1s week deadlift both of the 1s weeks. Failing on deadlifts is a reocurring pattern, possibly because it's the one lift that didn't get negatively impacted by the cut before, so  I wasn't regaining any lost strength.\n\nFor assistance work, \n - on day 1 I was keeping the chins\/dips\/assisted nordics from BBB. I kept progressing the number of dips and nordics when I could, getting to 170 reps by the end. Chins I kept the same. \n - On day 2 I would do cheaty dumbbell rows superset with the bench progressing from 5x10 to 5x20 with the same weight I started with. I'd then do the same for dumbbell bulgarian split squats, however only getting to 5x17 there, because BSSs are hard and end with ab wheel working up from 25 2ft partials to 65 2ft partials and then 15 3 ft ones. \n - On day 3 I would do deficit pushups for total number of reps, working up from 100 to 150 superset with band pullaparts between each set\n  \nFor conditioning, I'd do a rotation of workouts on the off days, doing conditioning twice a week. The workouts were\n - Kalsu scaled to 46kg\n - Haystacks (like Kalsu, but 300 kb swings with 30kg instead of 100 thrusters)\n - MS's Tower of Babel for Zercher squats\n - Crossfit Open 22.2\n\nI was also still keeping up the Zercher\/DB overhead carries from BBB\n\n**Deep Water Beginner**\n\nI kept this one pretty much as it was. I feel like it doesn't give you as much freedom to do stuff as 531. Not saying that's a bad thing.\n\nFor main work, I was having to break up the later deadlift sets into smaller sets often. To be fair, I don't think, I was doing much worse on deadlifts than on squats, I was simply much more able to rest in top position of a back squat than on a deadlift.\n\nI'd do ghd situps instead of normal situps and for conditioning I was doing the Zercher\/overhead carries on the fifth day. And every training day I'd do a 10 min conditioning workout from Brian alsruhe's lift specific conditioning sessions. (squat specific on leg day, deadlift specific on back day even if leg day was deadlifts)\n\n**Deep Water Intermediate**\n\nPretty important change here was that on the last day of DW beginner I injured my knee somehow (I blame increasing weight on the zercher carries for it - it was reasonably challenging to carry, but getting it off the ground was a bitch and my left knee woke up unable to go under parallel next day. I found out however that I could do box squats without a problem, so I finished the program doing them. \n\nI also got sick for the first week, so I had to take one week of unplanned deload, then I took one week of getting back into it with 5x10 of the weight I wanted to use as my working weight for Intermediate (adjusting the power clean and push press weights after I failed 5x10 with them on this week). After those setbacks I finished the last six weeks. I skipped lunges on the last deadlift day though. I just really wanted not to do lunges and felt like I deserved.\n\nOh, also I failed deadlifts every day except the last one.\n\nFor conditioning here on the fifth day I would do pretty random crossfit style wods but making them up myself instead of using an app. They were either Painstorm XXI, 100 bear complexes, 100 ABCs or half Kalsu at Rx weight. I was alsokeeping up the exercise specific conditioning sessions from Brian Alsruhe.\n\n# Rest\n\nDuring the 531 part, I had summer break and very good sleep schedule. During the Deep Water part, uni started again and I got a new job that had me working nights. The Deep Water part was the best thing that happened to my bench press in my entire life, so maybe you should try not sleeping at all for 48 hours and then sleep 12 hours in one go from morning and waking up when it's night again. Though I did average 7-8 hours a day over a week most weeks, so it wasn't that bad. Not perfect sleep for sure though.\n\n# Nutrition\n\nI started at 3200 calories, ended at 3700. Didn't follow Jim Wendler's nor Jon Andersen's diet advice at all. I did eat a lot of eggs and meat though, I simply didn't eat as much of them as Jim recommends and I ate carbs too. During the 531 part, I was eating pizza like three times a week also, because I worked at a pizza place.\n\n# What worked\n\nBenching once a week - I was *very* surprised by how great Deep Water worked for my bench, considering it has the most basic bro bench approach of 3x10 for everything.\n\nBeing stubborn on squats - the \"zeroth\" week of intermediate, I failed squats. However, I decided to simply be more tough and do them instead of failing and it worked, I never failed on squats afterwards\n\nBox squats - those are an amazing movement, I can't believe I only discovered them after this\n\nBurpees - I was never in better shape than during this run of BtM because I was doing burpees during every conditioning session\n\nZercher\/Overhead carry superset - I genuinely believe this is the best way to look like a fridge\n\n# What didn't\n\nBeing stubborn on deadlifts - I was failing deadlifts more often than not by the end and that was stupid. I could get the same or better training effect from weight that would allow me to finish the program as prescribed\n\n# Looking ahead\n\nCurrently, I'm thinking of doing DW Advanced, so I can set some 5RM PRs and get the right to say I've done all of Deep Water. I'm actually pleasantly surprised by not being as fat as I thought I'd be after six months of a bulk where I was really eating a lot, so I think I'll still do that on a surplus. Then probably I'll lose some weight, even if I don't feel like I need it, just because I would like not to have to poop so often for a while. Will likely focus on my conditioning during that, because that's one of the thing I can do successfully on a cut and having done half Kalsu at Rx weight makes me think that maybe I could do the whole thing.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1671884988.0},{"title":"33 weeks and 3 blocks of 531: 2x BBB and 1x SSL","author":"StooneyTunes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/ztv2wg\/33_weeks_and_3_blocks_of_531_2x_bbb_and_1x_ssl\/","text":"## History\n\nBeen working out on and off for the past few years. My most recent stint has been fairly consistent and I ran StrongLifts for 13 weeks before grinding myself to a halt on the Texas Method while cutting for another 3 months. After that I tried to maintain my bodyweight and running a linear periodization cycle where I *grossly* miscalculated the load for sets and reps.\n\nThat drove me to 531 while bulking for a change of pace to something someone else had written.\n\n## Program\n\nThe geneeral setup I used was 2 leaders, 1 anchor. Between leaders and anchors I would work up to a single at my TM and do a single set all-out to failure for the assistance.\nBetween anchor and the next leader I would work up to a TM test (results below) and repeat the single set to failure for assistance.\n\nI didn't go balls to the walls on PR sets during the anchors, but stopped once I noticed bar speed slowed significantly and I only had a few reps left in the tank. I went all-out during the TM tests, including having spotters for squats and bench.\n\n### Cycle 1-3\n\nI opted for a high volume leader and following up with a decent chunk of assistance because I was bulking during the first 22 weeks.\n\nLeader: 5s PRO + BBB, Anchor: PR Set + FSL, 50-100 reps of assistance in both leader and anchors\n\nExample Squat day:\n\nPush: Dips 25-50 reps, overhead extension 50 reps  \nPull: Pull Ups 25-50 reps, curls 50 reps  \nSLC: GHD 20-30 reps, Weighted V Ups 30-50 reps\n\n### Cycle 4-6\n\nSince the first cycle went so well I repeated it, only replacing some exercises here and there.\n\nLeader: 5s PRO BBB, Anchor: PR Set + FSL, 50-100 reps of assistance in both leaders and anchors\n\n### Cycle 7-9\n\nWhen I came to my third block, I had stopped bulking because I was feeling a bit fluffy. I wanted to run a weight maintenance phase and did a more strength oriented block to follow suite.\nI kept assistance mostly to compounds, adding isolations back in the anchor.\n\nLeader: Leviathan + SSL + 25-50 reps of assistance, Anchor: PR Set + FSL + 50-100 reps of assistance\n\n### Conditioning\n\nThroughout I maintained 4 easy and 1 hard conditioning sessions per week. Easy conditioning would be 20-30 minutes of running, biking, rowing. Hard conditioning consisted of ripping the endurance WOD out of the box where I lift. Usually 30-40 minutes in length using KBs, DBs, Barbells and various machines. \n\n## Results\n\n| Lift \t\t| Start\t\t| C3 \t\t| C6\t\t| C9 \t\t| Change\t|\n| :--\t\t| :-- \t\t| :-- \t\t| :--\t\t| :-- \t\t| :--\t\t|\n| Squat \t| 5x135 (159)\t| 4x145 (164)\t| 4x160 (181)\t| 3x175 (193)\t| 33 kg\t\t|\n| Bench\t\t| 1x112.5\t| 4x100 (113)\t| 3x107.5 (118)\t| 3x115 (127)\t| 15 kg\t\t|\n| Deadlift\t| 8x160 (203)\t| 5x182.5 (213)\t| 4x197.5 (224)\t| 3x212.5 (227)\t| 24 kg\t\t|\n| Press\t\t| 1x72.5\t| 5x67.5 (79)\t| 3x75 (83)\t| 4x75 (85) \t| 12 kg\t\t|\n| Bodyweight\t| 82.5\t\t| 84.3 kg\t| 86.8 kg\t| 90.1 kg\t| 7.6 kg\n| Wilks | 318.21 || | 366.44 | 48.23\n\nI had to reset the press at the end of the second cycle because the reps felt bad at the TM test, so I took the e1RM and went from there.\n\nIt seems my lifts responded differently to both BBB and Leviathan, but overall I'm really happy with these improvements in e1RMs.\n\n## Thoughts and reflections\n\nNext cycle will be spent cutting, I figure a block is a good length to lose 3-4 kg of fluff.\n\n5s PRO works well for for limiting effort on the heavy work and focusing effort on the volume, but as my TM crept up, the third week of some cycles became a mental challenge. Going forward I might just stick to the OG 531 sets and reps, but eliminate the AMRAP. So 531 PRO?\n\nSome things I might try differently next time is to turn the assistance rep recommendations on its head. For me it makes more sense to also do higher amounts of assistance in the volume phase of a block, not in the intensity phase. That leaves more recovery to push the main lifts.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671836081.0},{"title":"December 24 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zu28jb\/december_24_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1671858070.0},{"title":"Foodie Friday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/ztbo8c\/foodie_friday\/","text":"Weekly thread for discussing:\n            \n* recipes\n* nutritional plans\n* favorite foods\n* macro schemes \n* diet questions","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1671789667.0},{"title":"December 23 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zt6x80\/december_23_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1671771670.0},{"title":"Are overhead triceps extensions better than pushdowns for hypertrophy? - Stronger by Science","author":"just-another-scrub","url":"https:\/\/www.strongerbyscience.com\/research-spotlight-triceps?ck_subscriber_id=694508766","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671654930.0},{"title":"December 22 Daily Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zsctou\/december_22_daily_thread\/","text":"You should post here for:\n\n* PRs\n* General discussion or questions\n* Community conversation\n* Routine critiques\n* Form checks","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1671685271.0},{"title":"Do These to Get More Out of Your Romanian Deadlifts","author":"trebemot","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RtmoY-CcNAk","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1671652763.0},{"title":"[Meet Report] WRPF Bulgaria All Power | 26M | 730kg@98.7kg | 446 Old Wilks | 451 Dots | Raw","author":"cwetanow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zreu9h\/meet_report_wrpf_bulgaria_all_power_26m\/","text":"**Background and Training**\n\nLifting about 10 years, first powerlifting competition was in 2018, second competition for this year.\n\nBest lifts in the gym are 260kg squat back in April 2021, 167.5kg bench this summer, and a 310kg deadlift from the spring. \n\nMostly doing my own programming, focused on the big 4 along with dips and pull ups, running 4-5 week blocks with minor changes to see what has an effect.\n\n**Meet Prep**\n\nStarted peaking around 3 weeks out and dropped a calibrated 25kg plate on my foot about 17 days out. At first, I thought that I broke something but a doctor examination showed that it was only a bruise. Rested for 3 days and did the last heavy workout - planned second attempts for a [720kg total](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/TVZdP_p1qCA). I felt amazing here with plenty left in the tank.\n\nAfter this I did mostly singles with the last workout 3 days out.\n\n**The Meet**\n\nDid not cut weight (cuz I don't like to) and weighed in 98.7kg in the 100kg class the day before the meet. \n\nOn day of the meet, there was a slowdown, we were supposed to start squats at 16:30, ended up starting at 18:30\n\n**Squat - 235kg | 250kg |** **~~260kg~~**\n\nFelt good on warmups, platform had an edge just on the half of my foot and felt unstable. Couldn't beat my 255kg from the last meet, so disappointment numero uno\n\n**Bench - 150kg | 160kg |** **~~165kg~~**\n\nHad to redo the last warmup (140kg) at least 4 times since there was a freak accident in the other flight and the meet was moving quite slow. First two attempts were slower than usual and missed the third, failing to beat my meet best from last meet, disappointment numero 2.\n\n**Deadlift - 290kg | 310kg | 320kg**\n\nDeadlift warmups were not feeling amazing, and at this point it was well past 22:30, so I just wanted to go home. Opener flew and I thought that there could be something big cooking. Put up 310kg for a second attempt and it also moved quite well. At this point, I secured second place with not chance for gold, so said fuck it and put 320kg for a third. Hype was unreal and managed to pull them (with a bit in the tank) for a **MASSIVE 10kg PR** and the heaviest deadlift in my flight. Also broke 700lbs but nobody on this side of the pond cares.\n\n**Results**\n\n730kg total for a 7.5kg total PR with almost no change in wilks or dots (last meet the scale was weighing around 2kg less than actual).\n\nAs a natural at an untested meet, placed second in the 100kg category. Before the meet, the organizers announced an elite flight (top 12 on opener wilks) for which I didn't classify but ended at 10th place overall across weight classes on Wilks.\n\n**Going forward**\n\nGave it a week of rest along with some travel, so now it's time to start easing into things, next meet is planned for May 2023.\n\nAnd [videos](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CL5l-UUC-C4&ab_channel=cwetanow) for those of you that read all the way to the end","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1671612270.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Neutral Grip Deadlifts","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zriqvh\/weakpoint_wednesday_neutral_grip_deadlifts\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

I've done BJJ for the last 10 years and a smattering of other martial arts (judo, MT, MMA) since I was 16.\n\nI was only lifting sporadically until I got a garage gym in 2019. I had to stop BJJ when covid hit so I spent the next couple of years lifting at home. My equipment is limited to a barbell, a rack, plates, rings, a 45lb KB and a few dumbbells and that has biased my training.\n\nIn that time I've run various flavors of the Stronger by Science programs as well as some 531 programs, including Beefcake. I had actually finished last year with Beefcake so I thought it would be nice to compare my current state to where I was at that time. The numbers at the end of Beefcake are in my Dec 2021 column above.\n\n# STARTING POINT\n\nPrior to starting GGBB I had run SBS using the original template for deadlifts and the hypertrophy template for everything else. The results are in my May 2022 table above.\n\nMy bodyweight is weird there: I was at 225 at the end of Beefcake in Dec 21, went on a brief cut post holidays then bulked back up to 234, and then got a nasty bug which took me all the way down to 219 in 3 weeks. I used 219 as my starting weight for GGBB.\n\n# THE PROGRAM\n\nu\/gzcl explained GGBB thoroughly [here](https:\/\/swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com\/2022\/01\/general-gainz-body-building.html), so I'm only going to describe my approach:\n\n||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|Progression|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**T1**|Squats|OHP \/ Chin ups|Bench \/ Row|Deadlift \/ Weighed dips|6 and 4x3 to 12 and 4x9, then add 10%|\n|**T2**|CG Bench \/ Row|RDL \/ Ring dips|Front Squat|Seated OHP \/ Chin ups|AMRAPs to 3x15 or 45 reps total, then add 10%|\n|**T3**|Curls \/ Lat raises|Curls \/ Skull crushers|Curls \/ Lat raises|Curls \/ Skull crushers|AMRAPS, increase weight at 3x18|\n\n* I superset every bench set with one set of rows at the same reps and weights\n* I used a weight vest on the T1 dips and pull ups, and a weight belt and plates on the T2 dips and chins.\n* Rows and RDLs were done with straps, regular deadlift was chalk only\n\nI didn't do explicit conditioning or abs, but my BJJ classes include a lot of both and I was going 4 times a week.\n\n**T1 progression explained:** \n\n1. I started out with a 6RM for each T1 exercise, leaving 1 or 2 reps in the tank. I then followed it up with 4 half sets of 3.\n2. During the next session I tried to get 4 2\/3rd sets of 4.\n3. Once I could get those 4 2\/3rd sets, I would push the first set and try to hit a new RM. Usually I tried to go up by 2 reps, so aiming for an RM set of 8 and 4 half sets of 4.\n4. I kept this up until I could hit an RM of 12 and 4 follow up sets of 9, then I increased the weight by 10% and restarted with a top set of 6 (which was a bit light in some cases, but gave me room to grow)\n\n# REST\n\nI was inspired by Cody's idea of never taking rest days: I didn't quite manage that, but I tried to run the program continuously: For example I would run days 1 to 4 from Monday to Thursday, then start again with the next D1 on Friday.\n\nI would take the occasional day off between cycles or mid cycle if I had to, but I kept that to a minimum. I had also gotten back to doing BJJ 4 times a week since October so I either had 2 a days or I would at least do BJJ on any day where I didn't lift.\n\n# NUTRITION\n\nI didn't track what I was eating but I tend to eat very similar things and amounts every day. I only ate as much as I was hungry, but I still managed to pack on 10lbs. Some of it is definitely fat but I do look much buffer.\n\nIt's not as much progress as an intentional bulk would have been but it worked.\n\n# WHAT WORKED\n\n* My RMs all went up by quite a bit, and the e1RM by much more\n* Spending multiple cycles or weeks at the same weight while adding reps made me more comfortable than I've ever been with those weights.\n* I can handle much more frequency and total work than I used to: 48 reps of 365 deadlifts would've buried me last year. It's still hard as balls now but I know I can do it.\n* Doing front squats for multiple sets of 15 is always going to be a humbling experience\n* The autoregulation of this framework is great when you're balancing other sports: I could always dial up or down based on how BJJ had gone.\n\n# WHAT DIDN'T\n\n* Not enough exercise variety: I was running the same lifts with little change or time in between for 6 months, and I was starting to accumulate some nagging injuries. It also got mentally draining by the end.\n   * Note that this isn't a problem with the program, just my rigid ass sticking to the same thing too much for too long\n* I wonder what the results would be with more intentional nutrition\n\n# LOOKING AHEAD\n\nI fully intend to run this program again next year, with some changes:\n\nWhen I get back from holiday I'm going to run a version of Brian Alsruhe's RPM program to get my conditioning back up. It's a 6 day per cycle program with EMOM sets and a wider variety of lifts. His OG version runs for 3 week cycles but I'll decide how long to run it for later.\n\n* Once I'm done with that I will go back to GGBB but I think I'll stick to a 6 day rotation with the added exercise to give myself some more leeway between repeating the same movement.\n* I' will also experiment with different setups for the T2s than 3 AMRAPs, like maybe incorporating some of u\/mythicalstrength's bad ideas to get to the same rep total without straight sets.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671219754.0},{"title":"[PROGRAM REVIEW]: Super Squats: The \"What Would Bruce Randall Do\" Edition.

In my mind it was one of the most effective programs of all time AND once of the most traumatic experiences of all time.  I could still remember the pain of those 20 rep sets, the anxiety that existed between workouts, and being SO happy when it was over.  I said I\u2019d run it again some day, and had recommended the book to SO many trainees, yet took SO long to finally saddle back up and do it all over again.\n\n* A lot had changed between then and now.  One of the biggest factors being that I had my ACL reconstructed in 2015 after rupturing it and part of my meniscus in a strongman competition.  That changes squats a little.  But I was also much smarter about training and nutrition than I was as a meathead college kid, so that\u2019s cool.\n\n* For the full rundown on stats, I\u2019m 37, 5\u20199, bodyweight somewhere in the high 180s, have lifted weights for 23 years, competed in strongman for a decade off and on, did some powerlifting, combat sports\/martial arts experience, and has accumulated some bumps and scrapes along the way.    \n\n**WHAT SUPER SQUATS IS\/IS NOT**\n\n* First, it is NOT a squatting program.  Oh my god I hate how I have to keep explaining this.  Am I the ONLY one who got taught \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u201d  Same thing with the \u201c30lbs of muscle in 6 weeks\u201d thing: quit focusing on that.  The squatting in Super Squats is PURELY a mechanism employed to trigger muscular bodyweight growth in a trainee.  It wasn\u2019t a program designed with \u201cimproving your squat as much as possible!\u201d or \u201cthe surefire solution to chicken legs!\u201d: the BREATHING squat is chosen because it\u2019s a way to trigger full body growth.  And no: I don\u2019t mean \u201cit causes the release of HGH\/testosterone\u201d: I\u2019m talking about the fact that, when you do breathing squats, you spend a LOT of time with a weight on your back, which is signaling to your body that the whole BODY needs a LOT more muscle SOON if it wants to survive.  The squatting itself adds stimulus, absolutely, but I\u2019ve found that one can employ good mornings to a similar effect, and there\u2019s a solid argument about being able to employ trap bar lifts as well.\n\n* It is a SYSTEM, not a workout.  Specifically, that system is premised upon the idea of putting the entire body under SIGNIFICANT stress 2-3 times a week, and consistently upping that stress so that it\u2019s never able to fully cope.  This is why you use the weight you\u2019d squat for 10 to do 20 reps, and it\u2019s why you add 5lbs per workout.  A lot of folks seem to think the magic is just in the squat set, so they\u2019ll do a set of 20 breathing squats ONE time and go \u201cYeah, that was hard, but I don\u2019t see the big deal\u201d.  The big deal is that you have to do it AGAIN 2 days later\u2026with 5lbs more than before\u2026for 6 weeks.  You can\u2019t just take the squats part of Super Squats in isolation: it\u2019s a whole system.  It\u2019s also why the gallon of milk a day is associated with it: it\u2019s a system of training insanely hard and then eating VERY big so that you can be recovered enough to achieve the next goal.  It\u2019s why when people ask \u201cwhat should I do if I fail\u201d on the program, I tell them \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d.  If you are actually eating as much as you need to eat and following the program, success should be your only outcome\u2026assuming you have the necessary mental fortitude to get through it.\n\n* [It is a BOOK](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks\/dp\/0926888005).  Every time I see a trainee fail with \u201cSuper Squats\u201d, it\u2019s because they\u2019re not actually doing Super Squats, because they didn\u2019t read the book.  The book can be read in an afternoon and it\u2019s $10 on Kindle: there\u2019s zero excuse for not reading it.  It explains EVERYTHING.  It doesn\u2019t just lay out a program: it walks you through step by step how to execute it, gives you instructions on how to perform ALL the exercises, it lays out a very effective nutrition protocol, it gives you psychological coaching to get through the squat set (along with saying MANY times that it\u2019s 3 deep breaths between EVERY rep\u2026but I digress), and even goes into the history of squatting and strong people in general, and EVEN gives you a follow-on plan so you can actually run Super Squats for QUITE a long duration.  There is a reason I practically THROW this book at every new trainee: if you read it, you will have pretty much everything you could ever need.\n\n**MY RUN OF THE PROGRAM**\n\n* When I began Super Squats, I was amazed at how many people who read my blog kept asking me what my plan was.  \u201cYou started at 315lbs: are you planning on going all the way to 405 for 20?\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve done 5x10x405: are you planning on going higher than 405?\u201d  \u201cAre you planning on making this even more challenging than the book says?\u201d.  I kept saying the same thing: \u201cMy goal is to experience this experience\u201d.  It was to the point that I think OTHER people were getting anxiety over my \u201clack of a plan\u201d.\n\n* Folks: CHAOS IS THE PLAN.  It\u2019s not just a thing I say: it\u2019s the truth.\n\n* \u2026and BOY was it the truth.  When I originally mapped out the 6 week block of Super Squats, I had a full 6 weeks on my schedule with uninterrupted time set out.  2 weeks before I started, my job threw a trip on my schedule from Mon through Thurs of my first week of the program.   Cool, time to call an audible.  I did the first workout on a Friday, my second workout the Monday I left for the trip, and the third workout on the Friday that I returned home.\n\n* \u2026except that, in between Monday and Friday, on that work trip, I came down with RSV.  On Tuesday night of that week, I did not sleep, because my fever was so high I had forgotten how to sleep.  I literally ate non-stop for 2 hours before that, because my kid had RSV before I left and they were taking FOREVER to heal because they wouldn\u2019t eat, so I knew calories were the answer.  My appetite was shot, but that\u2019s never slowed me down before, and, thankfully, my room was fully stocked with travel food, because I know how to travel.\n\n* \u2026and then I STILL did my 3rd workout on Friday, with RSV\u2026and promptly proceeded to pull something in my innerquad\/outer hamstring on my right leg on rep 15, because I forgot to factor in the significant impact of dehydration when you\u2019ve been losing all your fluids to an awful ragged cough.  Which, if you want some real fun: try BREATHING squats with RSV.  Also: symptoms last for 2 weeks\u2026so that\u2019s cool.\n\n* Whelp, Chaos it the Plan: \u201cWhat Would Bruce Randall Do?\u201d  He\u2019d do some goddamn good mornings, and that was EXACTLY what I did.  I figured: if a dude that broke his leg in 7 places could use good mornings to build up to a 600lb squat, I could use them to get through Super Squats.  [Cue one of the hardest workouts of my life](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vp0RHBNFwgo)\n\n\n* I kept the weight EXACTLY the same as what I failed on with the squats, because I figured THAT was the most significant part of the program.  It\u2019s why I picked good mornings as well: it\u2019d keep the weight ON my back in the same spot as before with the same weight as before.  \n\n* I genuinely think that workout was so hard it scared my body into healing, because I was able to return to squatting again for the next workout.  I was in pain, sure, and I had to take the squats slow, but I wasn\u2019t missing any reps.\n\n* And then, like an idiot, I forgot the lessons I had learned about hydration and keeping my legs warm and, without my morning Gatorade and sweats, went and TORE my hamstring\u2026this time on rep 20!  Yup: that was workout 7.\n\n* Back on the good mornings, but this time the hamstring was so borked I couldn\u2019t get the weight that I needed to for progression.  I got hurt with 345, and 350 wasn\u2019t stable, so I warmed up until I felt the hamstring start to buckle and went for [max rep GMs]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2tcuISpN63w)\n\n\n* So now Chaos really IS the plan: 5lb progressions between workouts just ceased.  What is one to do?  Well, the middle of that good morning workout and my next squat workout, Thanksgiving happened, which meant I had to [pull 401 reps with 135lbs on a high handle trap bar in a single set]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JWkSz-QEtSk)\n\n\n* Because traditions damnit!\n\n* Next Super Squats workout, all my hamstring would tolerate was 315lbs, so I went and took it for a ride and only managed 16 reps before I could feel it start to buckle and bulge.  So I got to yes by racking the bar, trying 1 more rep, hitting my pullovers, and then immediately getting pissed off, strip the bar to 245lbs and get my 20 reps in.  Mission absolutely accomplished. Please note my use of knee wraps to hold my hamstring in place\/together, as that would be in effect for the remainder of the program.\n\n* \u2026and with THAT, the new way forward began.  We had finished workout 9, which was halfway through the program, and a new plan emerged: take 315 for as many reps as possible.  Which is TOTALLY in-line with something the book discussed about dudes going for 30 reps with breathing squats. Chaos is the plan, and we moved forward with that plan.\n\n* \u2026and comically enough, people STILL asked me what I was planning.  \u201cAre you going to stick with 315 or eventually up the weight?\u201d  This whole run of SS could NOT be any more an indication of \u201cChaos is the Plan\u201d.  And I\u2019M SO thankful that I embraced that from the start.  If I set out with a goal to squat 405 for 20, I\u2019d just be miserable with how this whole experience turned out, and probably would have shut it all down at the halfway point when I \u201cfailed\u201d to add 5lbs.  Instead, I got to experience the most challenging run of Super Squats perhaps EVER performed: afflicted with RSV for about half of it, through torn muscles, adding a rep each session and nearly blacking out from effort, with some Bruce Randall good mornings for good measure.  This is the Chaos edition of Super Squats, and it\u2019s amazing.\n\n* For those that want to watch the whole process, [here is the youtube playlist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_xRsOupFXRk&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj-7FrJPuy)\n\n**MY SPECIFIC TRAINING PLAN**\n\n* The very first time I ran the program 15 years ago, I did an abbreviated approach, because that was all the rage then.  This time, I wanted to stay pretty close to what the book laid out.  I did no calf work, and my ab work was standing ab wheel, but for the most part I stuck with the program laid out in the book while employing the exercises listed.  \n\n* I created two separate training days (A and B) and rotated between them every training day, 3x a week.  Do, for example: Week 1 would go A-B-A, week 2 B-A-B, repeat.  This got me a little bit of variety and allowed me to have some extra recovery between sessions of SLDL.  They broke down as such.\n\n**DAY A**\n\n> Axle clean and strict press 3x10\/superset with 50 band pull aparts\n\n> Weighted dips 3x12\/superset with axle bent over rows 2x15\n\n> Breathing squats 1x20\/pull overs 1x20\n\n> Axle Straight Legged Deadlifts 1x15\n\n> Poundstone curls (1 rep more than previous workout each time)\n\n**DAY B**\n\n> Incline DB bench 3x12\/superset with 2x15 weighted chins\n\n> Behind the neck press 3x10\/superset with 50 band pull aparts\n\n> Breathing squats 1x20\/pull overs 1x20\n\n> Kroc rows 1xmax reps\n\n> Axle shrugs against bands 1xmax reps\n\n> Reverse hyper 1x50+ reps\n\n* Once this portion of the workout was finished, I\u2019d drink a protein shake (a PROTEIN shake you philistines: NOT a carb\/fat shake.  It was egg whites mixed with a scoop of protein powder), and then finish up with 20 reps of standing ab wheel, 30 glute ham raises, 25 push downs, band curls on day B, and then some manner of 3-5 minutes of conditioning.  \n\n* On top of this, daily, I\u2019d do either 5 minutes of kettlebell armor building complexes w\/24kg bells or the \u201cTABEARTA\u201d workout of Barbell bear complexes with 95lbs getting in 3 complexes per round.\n\n* In between Super Squats workouts (to include the two day break on the weekends), I\u2019d do conditioning workouts.  I initially was a little cute and creative, but pretty quickly I settled into a rut of something I referred to as \u201cArmor Bearer\u201d, [which looked like this]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=11wjg0LBbQw)\n\n\n* An \u201cArmor Bearer\u201d is 5 minutes of Dan John\u2019s kettlebell \u201cArmor Building Complex\u201d (2 cleans, 1 press, 3 front squats) followed immediately with TABEARTA (tabata protocol Bear complexes w\/95lbs).  \n\n* Just 1 round of these can absolutely nuke you if you really push it (for me, that\u2019s getting around 25 ABCs and a full 8 rounds of 3 complexes with the bears), but for the Tuesday workout I\u2019d typically do 3 rounds of these.  Weekends would be 1-3 rounds.  On Thursdays, I\u2019d end up doing something slightly less aggressive, like a circuit of swings, thrusters and burpee chins or something similar.  Basically, I\u2019d recover\/recharge over the weekends, come out hard * * Mon through Wed, and need a slight dip down in intensity on Thurs to be able to absolutely smash Friday.\n\n* On Tues and Thurs, I\u2019d train fasted.  I feel like that\u2019s better for nutrient partitioning post workout.  For the Super Squats workouts, I had half a low carb bagel with sunflower seed butter pre-workout for the first half of the program, switching to a slice of homemade sourdough toast with sunflower butter for the second half\u2026because my wife took up making sourdough and it\u2019s amazing.\n\n* Oh yeah, one other thing: I was STILL training first thing in the morning for all of these workouts.  Typically around 0400.\n\n* What\u2019s worth appreciating is that I realize this violates Super Squats recommendation of resting as much as possible between the workouts, but it SHOULD be noted that this DOES represent a significant reduction in training volume for me.  Instead of 40-60 minute conditioning workouts, I was doing 10-30.  Instead of 10-20 minute conditioning workouts post lifting, it was 3-5.  I was sleeping more, and the volume within the lifting workouts itself was on the lower side.  This program will STILL beat you down, no matter who you are, and it DOES require throttling back to recover.\n\n**NUTRITION**\n\n* It would be WAY too tedious to document what I was eating, because I am a constant grazer as it is and this program just turned my appetite up to 11.  But I\u2019ll say that was probably the biggest thing: I stopped restricting myself and just ate if I felt any hunger.  I still stuck with Deep Water\/Mountain Dogg approved stuff for the vast majority of my nutrition, but was a bit more willing to eat \u201coff menu\u201d here and there.  I maintained a focus on food quality, and didn\u2019t need to resort to \u201cdirty\u201d eating to get in my calories.  Between avocados, nuts and nut\/sunflower seed butter, it\u2019s pretty easy to jack up calories, and mixed in with a variety of animal based protein sources and some keto magic breads\/tortillas, I was in a good way.  My dirtiest daily item was a protein bar\/keto bar, which is also one of the first things I cut out of a diet when I\u2019m no longer gaining.\n\n* Biggest meals were always my post training breakfast and my pre-bed time meal.  Eating before bed remains one of the most effective strategies I know for gaining, and I love starting the day off with a win by smashing a VERY large and nutritious breakfast.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n* As much as it upsets people, I don\u2019t weigh myself, and I took no before\/after photos.  \n\n* But what WAS amazing was how I was just smashing lifts every time I trained on this program.  I imagine coming into it with a LOT of accumulated volume and finally taking the time to laser focus it into an abbreviated approach really paid off, especially when paired with a LOT of food.  I\u2019m not an excel ninja, so I\u2019m just going to spell out the progress I had.\n\n* Axle clean and strict press went from 3x10x136 to 2x10x171 and 1x9x171 (so close!). Behind the neck press from 3x10x95 to 3x10x135, Weighted dips went from 3x12x55 to 3x12x100 and weighted chins from 2x15x7.5lbs to 2x15x20lbs(keeping in mind I gained bodyweight through the program), DB bench from 3x12x80s to 3x12x105s, Axle rows went from 2x15x193 to 2x15x228, Axle SLDLs went from 15x243 to 15x283 (doing them AFTER the squats is just awful), Kroc rows from 15x115 to 23x115\n\n* And, of course: Breathing Squats from 20x315 to 30x315\u2026WITH a recovering torn hamstring\n\n**LEESSONS LEARNED**\n\n* The squats themselves are immaterial: it\u2019s more about the loading of the body and hard effort.  In turn, the \u201c5lbs per week\u201d is also immaterial.  Good mornings and increasing reps proved viable, and I\u2019m sure there is much more room to play around with.  But that\u2019s why we run these programs: we learned lessons like that that we can carry forward.\n\n* If you\u2019re not drinking the gallon of milk a day, you\u2019ll have to eat like it\u2019s your job.  I really would have preferred to just suck down a gallon a day and eat normally vs the sheer volume of food I was putting away.  I legit felt like I had been hit by a bomb through weeks 3 and 4, and finally managed to get a handle on things toward the end.\n\n* If we wait until we feel good, we\u2019ll never train.  I tore my hamstring before I was halfway done with the program, and up until the final workout it still ached.  It hurt LESS, sure, but I could still make an argument that I was injured at the final workout. And if I waited until I was \u201cready\u201d to start again, I have no idea how long that would have taken.  Instead, I \u201cwent before I was ready\u201d, squatted through pain, used knee wraps to fake a hamstring, took things slow, etc.  I genuinely do not feel I slowed down my healing rate in doing so: if anything, I sped it up, because I kept the muscle moving and gave it fresh blood.  In addition, I had zero \u201cbreak back in\u201d period.  Often, people that get injured and rest take FOREVER to get back because, upon their return, they\u2019ll try out the movement that hurt them and still experience some pain in doing so, and they\u2019ll freak out and go back to resting.  My continuing in my training, I effectively did my own rehab, getting the muscle from completely worthless to almost 100% functional, and didn\u2019t miss any training as a result.\n\n**BONUS SUPER SQUATS RAMBLING!**\n\n* NOTE: What is written below are some jumbled thoughts I came up with toward the middle of my Super Squats run, so the timeline of thought processes may seem \u201coff\u201d.\n\n* Going beyond 20 reps has been such a different way to make this program awful, and I feel like it just compliments things so well.  Just by nature of my injury I ended up doing 2 weeks of going up 5lbs a workout before resetting the weight to the start and then going up one REP a workout, and both progression models seem to work out pretty well.  I feel like there\u2019s something to doing this intentional.  Perhaps running the program for 3 weeks where you go up 5lbs per workout, then reset and push max reps.  Another approach would be do 1 week going up 5 reps per workout, then hold that weight for the next week and go up a rep per workout and keep alternating that way.  A way to slow down the weight increases while still making things suck.  You might even do 10lb jumps during the weight increase weeks to compensate for the \u201cdown time\u201d.  Another option would be 6 weeks one way, 6 weeks the other, with a program in the middle of course.  \n\n* And then there\u2019s alternate MOVEMENTS to include in there.  I\u2019ve demonstrated that, at least ONE workout of \u201cSuper Good Mornings\u201d is viable.  It\u2019d be interesting to see what a full cycle would be like.  I also know that the book talks about hip belt squats, and from there the trap bar is a very logical transition.  And then we can combine that all with the above.  What about a week of good mornings where we progress weights, next week we take that top weight of good mornings and make it a squat week where we\u2019re chasing after max reps, and then next week is a trap bar week?  Are we making conjugate Super Squats?  It\u2019s a bit like Dogg Crapp, which, actually, would ALSO work just dandy here: change between 3 movements every workout.\n\n* I\u2019ve also entertained the idea of being cute and having a theme of \u201cPaul Kelso Super Squats\u201d.  Use the trap bar for presses, rows, trap bar lifts and SLDLs.  I\u2019m literally thinking AS I write this and I realize I just came up with a (potentially) INCREDIBLY effective hypertrophy program with ONE piece of equipment and NO rack.  Just think of how space economic that is.  Biggest issue would be getting the trap bar in place for pressing without a rack, but that circus act CAN happen.  And using radar chest pulls, you don\u2019t need a bench and dumbbell to get the pull over effect.  \n\n* All THIS said, I REALLY don\u2019t think the SSB meets intent here at all.  I feel like a BIG part of the \u201csuccess\u201d of this program Is having that bar just absolutely CRUSH you for all it\u2019s worth and you just survive for as long as possible.  The SSB is too comfortable AND it allows you to stand there and take the pressure off of you by pushing it back or pulling it forward as needed.  You are ON the clock when it\u2019s a barbell crushing you, and even with the trap bar with straps, you\u2019re still standing there having it pull your shoulders out of the socket.  Don\u2019t ask me about the belt squat: I have no idea how that\u2019s supposed to work.\n\n* I DO have to avoid for falling into the trap of making Super Squats the answer to everything.  I have to appreciate that this laser focused program was effective BECAUSE I came into it with SO much accumulated volume.  In that regard, I plan to do a write-up at some point of Super Squats and Deep Water being yin and yang.  Both absolutely crazy, but SO different in their insanity, making them ideal pairings.  3 days a week of 1x20 vs 1 day a week of 10x10.  Of course, the kind of dude that is just plain ALWAYS running Super Squats and Deep Water back to back is too crazy even for me.  At some point there would need to be some sort of OTHER side of balance, which would probably be a great time for a lighter 5\/3\/1 program, the 10K swing challenge, or something else just plain wildly different.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1671200808.0},{"title":"Program Review: Mass Made Simple plus 10,000 swing challenge","author":"Hombreguesa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zn23p7\/program_review_mass_made_simple_plus_10000_swing\/","text":"Hi, I'm Hombreguesa. I don't post in r\/weightroom, but I lurk here pretty often. I ran and MMS+10k Swings for 6 weeks, and completed it last Friday. This is my first time writing a program review, and I will do my best to keep it as clear and concise as possible. All weights used, **except for my kettelbell**, will be in pounds. I'm M\/34, 5'8\", my start weight was 171 lbs and my end weight was 178 lbs.\n\n**TLDR:** Ran MMS+10k Swings to completion, made some serious lean mass gains, completed the challenge at the end and the challenge I created for myself. Recommend to beginners and intermediates, might run again in the future. Oh, and training sessions, if done as written, will take you 90 to 120 minutes to complete. This was info I wanted before I started, but I could not find ANYWHERE. And I looked. \n\n# Training History\n\nMost of my life has been spent active. I played sports from elementary school through high school (football, swimming, senior year ran track to get better at running), martial arts in my late teens and early 20s, was an Infantryman in my mid 20s (lots of running and rucking), came home and lazed about for 7 months, and then got back into shape. That was at the age of 27.\n\nOver the past 7 years, a lot of that time was spent fucking around.  I just didn't know what I was doing. Much of that time was spent spinning my wheels. Lots of running, and body-split lifting with no real progress in strength development, and the occasional DVD program. So, to spare us all a lot of tedious details, I'll just say: eventually I figured out there were books on lifting out there.\n\nThis year was spent cycling Power to the People (PTTP), The Russian Bear (the hypertrophy version of PTTP), and Barbell Dry Fighting Weight (BBDFW). I did that twice, and that took me to about August. In that time, I increased my DL from 305 to 365, and my Press from 120 to 140. While these are not my goal weights, I was very happy to have finally made considerable progress.\n\nI started running Tactical Barbell Mass in September, got sick, and realized all I was doing was getting fat at that point. I changed gears and did an aggressive cut while running Dan John's Transformation Program and various conditioning through October. I started at 181 and cut down to 169 in 4 weeks. That's when I moved into MMS.\n\n# What is Mass Made Simple?\n\nMMS is a book and 6 week bulking program written by Dan John. It focuses on high rep squats, barbell complexes, bench press, one arm press, and some core and pulling work done with bird-dogs and an exercise that he calls the batwing. In total, it is 14 training sessions.\n\n The end goal of the program is to complete 50 reps with the prescribed weight for your weight class. If you are under 135 pounds, your goal is 135x50; 135-185lbs, 185x50; 185-205, 205x50; above 205, 225x50. For me, that means I was working toward 185x50.\n\nI should note that I made one change: I used floor press instead of bench press. I don't own a bench. That also means that I had to do the batwings standing like a bent over row, because, again, no bench.\n\n# What is the 10,000 Swing Challenge?\n\nPretty self explanatory. Do 10k swings within a given amount of time. I bought a 32kg kettlebell over the summer, and I needed to break it in with some high volume swings.\n\nThe way I did it was do 250 swings everyday for 40 days. I tried many different rep schemes. 25x10, 50x5, 17 swings EMOM for 15 min (comes out to 255), 13 swings EMOM for 20 min (260 swings), 10-15-25, 15-35, and eventually started trying for 250 in one go. And I mixed different exercises within these rep schemes. Push ups, dips, kneeling ab wheels, and TGUs. One time I did pull ups.\n\nIn the beginning, it would take around 17 minutes to get a swing session done. By the end, I cut that down to around 13 minutes. Ultimately, I did 10,090 swings.\n\n# Why MMS+10k Swings?\n\nAll year I've been telling myself and my wife that I was going to run Deep Water at the end of the year. Alas, the end of the year rolled around, and I just felt that I wasn't ready for it. This summer I read MMS, so I figured, why not? I had just bought squat stands, and I was continuing to neglect squatting.\n\nAfter rereading the book, I realized that I didn't want to forego conditioning. And while searching for program reviews on MMS to figure out how long sessions would last, I came across [this review](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/uuq4f2\/program_review_dan_johns_mass_made_simple_with\/) written by u\/langlois44. I filed the idea away.\n\nAs I got closer to actually starting the program, I decided that 10k swings seemed like too much work for me, but I did want to use swings as a daily conditioning tool. After reading about u\/GZCL and his results with no rest days, I figured it was worth a try.\n\nBut, how many swings a day? One hundred was too little, and 500 was too much. Then I found [the metabolic swing](https:\/\/www.t-nation.com\/training\/the-metabolic-swing\/) by Dan John. In it he says he did 250 a day for a month. That sounded good to me. Then I did the math: 250 swings daily for 42 days =...10,500 swings. The final workout of MMS is done on day 40, that makes 10k swings. So, that's how I got here.\n\nFor the final workout, I did decide, like two weeks in, to make it also a goal to do the 250 swings unbroken after completing the 185x50.\n\n# Did it work?\n\nHell yes. In the beginning, I was having a hard time switching over from cutting to bulking. I was definitely eating more, but my weight gain was slow. \n\nDay 1, I weighed in just a little over 171 Monday morning after completing my cut at 169 the previous Friday. In the first 3 weeks I only gained about 2 pounds, when everything that I had read had said they had gained up to 10lbs in the first half. I was very concerned. But, as the program progresses, the protein shake supplementation outlined in the book skyrockets. By the end, you're drinking 5 scoops of protein on training days. \n\nAll the shakes, and the gear change that finally led me to eating more, led me to putting more mass on in the second half. I ended at 178lbs. So, a total of 7lbs gained. This is not a huge amount comparatively to other testimonials, but the swings did their job and kept me fairly lean throughout. I remember one session of swings toward the end where I had this realization that the swings were doing what everyone says they're supposed to do in accordance for fat loss, and it was a big relief. Swings will do the trick.\n\nI did not take before\/after pictures, and I did not take measurements. I used the mirror and my wife as judge. I understand that that may be disappointing for some people, but I can be obsessive, and I didn't want to run the risk of getting too caught up in body image. \n\nI can see that my shoulders have rounded out in a way that I've never seen happen on me before, my lats thickened up nicely, my chest filled out, and of course my glutes and thighs are tighter in my jeans. And my wife has made MANY positive comments. That's good enough for me.\n\n# Highlights\n\n* I went from floor pressing 160 to floor pressing 200. Not groundbreaking weight, and not benching, but I haven't benched in almost three years, so I'm happy with it.\n* The first session **TO 50** was with 135, and I completed it before going to work, and I was feeling great all day. Even though it really sucked. Honestly, it sucked more than the final session with 185.\n* Thanksgiving fell on a training day. That was fucking glorious, and that is when I was able to finally get it in my head to eat everything I could get my hands on, as long as it wasn't pasta or pastries.\n* I completed the final session as intended: 185 **TO 50** followed by 250 swings unbroken. [Here is the 13 min video.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=teNet1mB5BQ) Some things to be said now that I have had time to revisit it: squat depth could definitely be deeper, that chest thump was completely involuntary due to the song that came on as I completed the squats (Destroy Everything by Hatebreed, anthem of my entire 20s), my transition was slower than intended, and the swings were not powerful and a little embarrassing. All that said, I'm still happy with myself and the progress I made.\n* After finishing the final session, I drove to Chicago with a childhood friend to see Modest Mouse perform Lonesome Crowded West in its entirety.\n\n# Problems\n\n* As stated, I had a hard time eating enough through the beginning. I discovered the magic of cottage cheese and started eating it every day, along with PB&Js, and any other snack I could find high in protein. I have a hard time eating a lot in one sitting, so I have to eat constantly throughout the day.\n* Grip strength was a definitely an issue on the swings. Shout out to u\/blrgeek for giving me the tip to use an over\/under grip, just like you would on a DL. Honestly, I felt stupid for not thinking of it myself. Grip strength still needed to develop after that adjustment, but it wasn't so limiting anymore. \n* Around the 4th week, I developed a strain in my lower right back. I made sure to take long warm ups on the days it was bothering me, and to just eat through it. The final week, I made sure to do easy swing sessions to make sure that my back would be good for the final session.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nWhile high rep squats suck in a way that I have never experienced, and I was so ready to be done with the program at week 4, I'm glad I did it. I recommend the program to anyone new to high rep squats, I feel that it is an assessable introduction into this realm of lifting. In the future, if I ever run it again, I'll bump up to the next weight class, even if I'm still below 185. And I'd make sure to hit depth with squats. I probably wouldn't do the 10k swings with it, though.

I tried out a few different programs like Unity, nSuns, and CAP3 before coming back to GZCL's UHF 5 week in the Summer. I also took part in a strongman competition in April as a novice lightweight and had a great time (finished like 12 out of 13!). I decided to do this meet again sometime around June\/July, signed up, and started lining up my programming for it. Doing a meet once a year seems to me enough for me at this stage.\n\n**Meet Prep**\n\nSince I've done it before with success, I decided to use GZCL's 9 week UHF program with the optional 3 week taper to peak for this meet. I enjoy this type of split, and I know I respond well to it. Everything went well until about the last two weeks when I somehow hurt something in my left trap\/clavicle area (which I'm still dealing with). It seems that anything that pulls my arm forward or down aggravates it, so I had to pull back on the programmed deadlift volume to try and help it recover enough for the meet. Luckily, it didn't seem to have any issues with squat and bench. I hit squat and bench openers the Monday before the meet and then some light warmups on S\/B\/D on that Wednesday. My main goal going into this meet was to get a 400+ DOTS score and hit some PRs on my lifts.\n\n**Meet Day**\n\nThis meet was at Everyday Athletes in Louisville, KY, which is the gym I go to. Last year it had like 120 lifters split between two platforms that took all day. This year only about 70 people signed up, so they did one platform split into morning and afternoon sessions. I weighed in at 78.0 Kg exactly, so I was in the morning session and in the second of two flights. I like this schedule a lot better since we were done with everything by about 12:30 pm.\n\n**Squats**\n\nI think this was the first meet where I went in with full confidence in my squats\n\n* 1st Attempt: [187.5 kg \/ 413 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1v5naKM9nvyc6cFHyarfeYjGZ6oEXSBFc\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. \n\n* 2nd Attempt: [200 Kg \/ 441 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1Bkv825ml6OYH2YTMb9RicQrNDbR7zQuq\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. This matched my best squat from my last meet. I had no doubt I would miss since I had also hit this for a few during the 2nd week of the taper.\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [207.5 kg \/ 457 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1KScU6cRw9VljdCxY9eEJDnA-JH2qouYq\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 7.5 kg meet and personal PR! My squat 1RM is not closer to 500lbs than it is to 400lbs, so I'm happy with that.\n\n**Bench**\n\n* 1st Attempt: [117.5 kg \/ 259 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1MC1g81sAZFSQJgP67uDSINTVR_BxQ4s-\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. \n\n* 2nd Attempt: [122.5 Kg \/ 270 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/10g_fTXFACrmRtonbyUcMEVf8sHpz3EPE\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. Not a PR, but I was happy that worst case I would be coming away with a better bench result than last meet.\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [127.5 kg \/ 281 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1DvownD_zDDm9d9ypuzyLze-aGDIwTzZA\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 2.5 kg meet and personal PR. This is now the 3rd time that I have set a bench PR in a meet after running GZCL 9 week UHF + 3 week taper.\n\n**Deadlift**\n\nMy shoulder was feeling okayish during warmups, so I knew I should be able to at least get through all of my attempts.\n\n* 1st Attempt: [227.5 kg \/ 502 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1zpW01sS4UzwG1hIlW2pmzZebRPeTrnDn\/view?usp=share_link) - Good.\n\n* 2nd Attempt: [240 kg \/ 529 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1whRjTbgD8PacsXLQ1di9dIKKwsJgQ6KY\/view?usp=share_link) - Good. A 2.5kg meet and personal PR!\n\n* 3rd Attempt: [250 kg \/ 551 lb](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1xCNNSXQSjRAq6DIFqAkLd9jEULZtUzz-\/view?usp=share_link) - Miss. It was moving until it wasn't. I tried as much as I could, but I just was not strong enough to lock it out. I felt my grip starting to slip too, so I'm not sure I would be able to hold on to it even if was able to get to lockout. My shoulder was not happy either lol.\n\n**Summary**\n\nI went 8\/9 with a 575 kg \/ 1267 lb total, a 402 DOTS score and PRs on everything. With how training went, I was hoping for a bigger deadlift PR; but now I have a future goal. \n\nGoing forward, I've jumped back into UHF 5 week and plan to just run that for the foreseeable future. Deadlifts are on the backburner for at least a cycle so that whatever is going on with my left trap\/clavicle\/whatever can heal. I think it's probably and overuse type strain. I really enjoyed this meet, but I did not come out of it rushing to sign up for another one. Part of that could be due to the fact that I am already signed up for a half-marathon in April. I might feel differently by the Summer, so I won't be surprised if I decide to sign up for this meet again next year.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1671035808.0},{"title":"Weakpoint Wednesday: Back Squat","author":"WeightroomBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/zlp4zh\/weakpoint_wednesday_back_squat\/","text":"# MAKING A TOP-LEVEL COMMENT WITHOUT CREDENTIALS WILL EARN A 30-DAY BAN\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWelcome to the weekly installment of our Weakpoint Wednesday thread.

I haven't been really into strength training before that, all I did was some push ups and pull ups from time to time. I used to be fat when I was younger, but I lost a lot of weight through dieting and long distance trail running. My first program was Stronglifts 5x5 which I did for a couple of months until it stopped giving me the results I wanted, then I did Madcow 5x5 until I wasn't satisfied, then I took up 5\/3\/1, but it seemed way too minimalist for me, and that's when I found nSuns.\n\n***Lifts Before:***\n\nBench Press - **117.5kg**\n\nSquat - **155kg**\n\nDeadlift - **180kg**\n\nOHP - **72.5kg**\n\nBodyweight - **98kg**\n\n***Total: 457kg*** (without OHP)\n\n**Lifts After 5 months:**\n\nBench Press - **140kg** *(+22.5kg)*\n\nSquat - **180kg** *(+25kg)*\n\nDeadlift - **200kg** *(+20kg)*\n\nOHP - **85kg** *(+10kg)*\n\nBodyweight - **105kg** **(+7kg)**\n\n***Total: 520kg*** (+63kg) (without OHP)\n\nHeight - 190cm (6'3'')\n\n# How I ran the program:\n\nSo, I wasn't doing the program as intended, as you probably can see from the weird distribution of added weight on each of the lifts.\n\nI almost completely ditched the deadlifts from the program. Why? Well, first off, I'm afraid of doing deadlifts because I can't get the form right, and the fact that I have lordosis to a small degree doesn't help me either because it's really hard for me to maintain a neutral spine during the lift, and I was paranoid that I'm going to injure myself from deadlifting so hard and often.\n\nYeah, I know it's a weird thing to do, but I just couldn't push myself. Besides, I go to the gym for pleasure and enjoyment, and I simply don't like deadlifting. My deadlift has increased even when I was not doing it, and I guess it came from squatting a lot.\n\nSecond change to the program, I wasn't doing front squats. Reason why is the same as for the deadlifts. I don't like that exercise, I really couldn't get the form right, and I was afraid that I was going to injure myself. The lifts that I was focusing on the most were the bench and OHP, and I'm really satisfied with the results that I got. I was really surprised with the bench press progress that I did in those 5 months, I don't think I even progressed that fast during my noob gains stage! Also the +10kg on the OHP is really satisfying.\n\nMy squat didn't go up that much because I got injured, so I had to drop a bit of weight at one point, and I'm still getting some knee pain while squatting.\n\nSince I was focused on the upper body, the accessory lifts were mostly focused on that too. I deloaded twice, once every two months, and another one is coming in December. Link to accessories - [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nSuns\/comments\/8fsjyi\/comment\/e7iwmf6\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nSuns\/comments\/8fsjyi\/comment\/e7iwmf6\/)\n\nDiet and lifestyle: My diet was very undifferentiated, I was mostly eating the same stuff, it consisted of oats, pasta, chicken breasts, milk, raisins, eggs, spinach, bananas. I didn't eat too many veggies unfortunately, sometimes I had weeks where I didn't eat a single vegetable, well, maybe besides carrot juice that I drink every other day. I ate 3400 to 3600kcal a day and it was mostly carbs and protein.\n\nI gained more than 1kg a month which some would say is way too much. I can see that there's a bit more fat on my body, but I'm fine with it. I'm planning to do a cut in a couple of months. I didn't do any cardio, of course. My sleep pattern is inconsistent because I suffer insomnia from the meds that I take, but the average was probably around 7 hours.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nI consider it a really good program. I probably could have had better gains if my lifestyle factors and technique were better. From what I've read, I got kind of lucky that I didn't sustain major injuries from the program, since that's a common thing from something this intense. I would recommend it to people who are willing to train hard and spend up to 10h a week in the gym.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1670864167.0},{"title":"Now Let's Improve Our Pull -- Carl Miller (1981)","author":"TheAesir","url":"http:\/\/ditillo2.blogspot.com\/2022\/11\/now-lets-improve-our-pull-carl-miller.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1670863841.0},{"title":"The 4-Power Exercise -- Donald V.

Together, with a deload in the middle, they take 13 weeks to complete.\n\nAll weights are in pounds.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nBodyweight went from 200.1 to 217.7 lbs. I had some nice rep PRs and learned a few things along the way.\n\nI recommend both of these programs for those looking to put on size. There's NO WAY you won't look\/feel stronger after doing them.\n\n# Background\n\n27 year old male, 5'11\" (180cm)\n\nI don't have much of a solid training background. Before COVID, I was spinning my wheels until I ran nSuns for a few months before everything closed down.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, I built myself a home gym and hopped back on nSuns. I ran it for ~6 months while cutting weight and regaining strength, then did Super Squats ([here](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/weightroom\/comments\/wrfndt) is my review of it if interested).\n\nTook a 2-week vacation during which I read the main 5\/3\/1 books (2nd Edition, Beyond, and Forever) to get familiar with the philosophy behind it (highly recommend). As soon as I got back home, I started Beefcake.\n\n# Training Maxes\n\n||Squat|Bench|Deadlift|OHP|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|**Beefcake Cycle 1**|225|190|275|110|\n|**Beefcake Cycle 2**|235|195|285|115|\n|**BtM Cycle 1**|245|200|295|120|\n|**BtM Cycle 2**|255|205|305|125|\n\n# The Programs\n\n## 5\/3\/1 BBB Beefcake\n\nThis was my first time ever running a 5\/3\/1 program, so I wanted to do it right. I did the lifting, jumps\/throws, and conditioning.\n\nFor jumps, I'd just get a plyo box or a bench and jump on it 10 times before starting the workout.\n\nAll supplemental work was done in under the prescribed 20 minutes, with most taking less than 15.\n\nI did not miss any reps in main working sets. In supplemental work sets, I'd occasionally miss a rep or 2 for the later bench sets, but I'd get them in rest-pause style.\n\nBy far the scariest part of the program is looking at the weights you have to lift on weeks 3 and 6. I was dreading the 5x10 squats at 180 lbs in the last week, and it made me eat more. I didn't miss a rep so it was worth it.\n\nA few modifications:\n\n- It's not explicitly stated on the program's blog post, but I used 5s PRO for the main work. This helped save energy for the supplemental work.\n- I took all OHP reps off the floor, except for the top set of weeks 3 and 6, where I only took the first rep off the floor.\n  - For the OHP supplemental, I did not SS them with rows, since I was cleaning the presses.\n- For weeks 2 and 5, I did the supplemental sets Malcolm X style: get 50 reps by any means necessary (sets of 10+ until I reach 50 reps).\n  - For bench, I did paused reps.\n\n## 5\/3\/1 Building the Monolith\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree with Jim when he says day 3 is the worst day in BtM. For me, it was day 1. Doing 100 chins in a session sucks. Doing 5x5 squats with a heavy weight also sucks, especially when it's @ 95%.\n\nBut these things make you strong supposedly, so I did them. I did sets of 4 chins. I'd do supersets of squats-chins-OHP-chins. Then, once the OHP sets were done, I'd do squats-chins-band pullaparts-dips-chins. By the time squat\/OHP sets were done, I'd have maybe ~20 chins left, so I did accessory circuits to get through to the end. This helped lower the amount of time this day took (~1 hour 5min on average).\n\nI only missed 1 rep throughout the program: week 6 OHP top set.\n\nThe widowmakers from weeks 1 to 4 felt really easy. In a future run, I might increase the percentages a bit to make them harder, e.g. using FSL weights.\n\nSome modifications:\n\n- Again, I took all OHP reps off the floor, except for the top set of weeks 3 and 6, where I only took the first rep off the floor. I'm gonna do this for all OHP in the future. It's cool.\n- I took the day 3 widowmakers beyond 20 reps. On the last week, I squatted 180 for 25 reps!\n- I only did the 100-200 dips on the first week (got 150), then started having chest pain whenever I did them. I did 50-60 the other weeks and got the rest in via pushups.\n  - I've since seen [this video by Brian Alsruhe](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qN6z_Tdhykc) which has some really good tips to relieve pain.\n- I don't own an 84-pound weight vest (and I honestly don't know if I'm strong enough to wear one at this point), so I did my weight vest walks with a 20-pound one.\n- I don't have an Airdyne, so for the post-day 3 conditioning, I'd do Juarez Valley front squats: 8-1-7-2-6-3-5-4 reps of front squats with 5 burpee chins between these sets.\n- I went pretty hard on conditioning. I did all the prescribed conditioning, and then some. I'd often do 2 conditioning sessions a day, each session ranging from 5-45 minutes. Some recurring ones were TABEARTA, PBJ, EMOMs of deadlifts\/pushups, various WODs. It varied a lot, but these are what I can think of off the top of my head at the moment. Did the same during Beefcake.\n\n# Diet\n\nI ate a lot, and mostly well. I kept processed stuff to a minimum and stuck to a more protein-centric, balanced diet. Most of it consists of eggs, chicken, beef, rice, potatoes, fruits, veggies, various cheeses, milk, etc. I also had a phase where I ate lots of PBJs; that was fun. I don't have a consistent set of meals I eat every day, so it's hard to \"eat more\" because it's hard to measure if you really are eating \"more\". To fix that, I just ate a lot. I ate everything.\n\nBBB Beefcake doesn't have a nutrition plan, but BtM requires 12 eggs and 1.5lb of ground beef per day. I did not follow this plan. I did for one day, but no more. It wasn't hard (it was just 1 day after all), but I just didn't feel like doing it for 6 weeks.\n\nI sometimes (very rarely) have a protein shake if I'm on a time crunch and have plans that complicate eating.\n\nI tracked calories during Beefcake (like I have since the start of the year), but dropped that for BtM. I don't plan on tracking ever again.\n\n# Results\n\nI'm bigger! I look bigger, I feel bigger, I act bigger. I started at 200.1 lbs and ended at 217.7 lbs.\n\nAlmost every time I see family\/friends they notice I'm getting bigger. It's confirmation enough for me that this is working.\n\nI haven't tested 1RMs, but I've gotten some rep PRs:\n\n||PR|\n|:---:|:---:|\n|**Squat**|5x5 @ 245|\n|**Bench**|5x5 @ 195|\n|**Deadlift**|3x5 @ 290|\n|**OHP**|1x4 @ 120 (missed 5th rep)|\n\nThese are all from the last week of BtM. More recently, I squatted 240 for 8 reps and OHP'ed 120 for 6 reps.\n\n# Lessons\n\n- I know that I'm capable of much more than what I thought. I'm almost never \"resting\" when working out now. I'm always doing something between sets, whether it's a quick set of chins, a few dips, or even just band pullaparts. I throw every workout into a circuit. It takes a lot of effort, but it really makes you feel like you worked hard. Plus it saves time.\n- In the past, I'd bulk\/gain by increasing calories and not changing anything about my lifting. I think I understand now that the calorie surplus presents a nice opportunity to reap the benefits of a scary\/challenging program.\n- Conditioning sucks. It is by far the hardest part of 5\/3\/1. I hate it but it helps _a lot_. Not only does it allow me to get extra volume, but it helps _so_ much with day-to-day and set-to-set recovery, and not feeling sore all the time. Also, the general suckage of conditioning is a useful reminder to push through a tough working set. Like, I'd rather do heavy 5x5 squats than a 4min tabata of bear complexes. The latter just feels like death. Anyway, I will never not do conditioning again.\n  - Conditioning is something I didn't do during Super Squats, and I feel like that hindered my performance during the program. My legs were always tired, which made me fail more sets than I would've liked.\n- Eating nutritious food helps with recovery also. My body just _feels_ so much better.\n  - This is also something I could've done better while running Super Squats. I was doing the gallon of milk a day, but I replaced the food I would've eaten instead. And the food I _did_ eat was mostly garbage: oreos, cookies, no fruits\/veggies...\n- I don't care about my 1RMs anymore. As long as I hit my working set reps and I train with effort, I'm happy. Plate milestones are still nice though...\n- I don't care about how much weight I've gained. There were times I'd eat just to make sure I hit my squat reps tomorrow. Ultimately, I might've put on a few extra pounds, which some might deem less than ideal, but fat loss is easy.\n- Training fasted first thing in the morning is so nice. It gets it out of the way, which allows me to shift my focus to other stuff for the rest of the day. And after a hard workout, you feel like you earned your breakfast.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nI'm currently cutting weight, while running 2 anchors of 5\/3\/1 FSL with PR sets and jokers to realize some strength gains. And I gotta say, cutting feels like a vacation compared to the past few months.\n\nOnce done, I will start Deep Water!\n\nThank you for reading.
