        "text": "Macronutrients are the three main categories of nutrients that the human body requires in large amounts in order to function properly. These nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n\nCarbohydrates are the body's main source of energy, and can be found in a wide range of foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. They are broken down by the body into glucose, which is then used to fuel the body's cells and organs.\n\nProteins are another important macronutrient, and are essential for the growth and repair of the body's tissues. They can be found in a variety of foods, including meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes.\n\nFats are the third major macronutrient, and are a concentrated source of energy for the body. They are also important for the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals, and for maintaining healthy skin and hair. Fats can be found in a variety of foods, including nuts, seeds, avocados, and oily fish.\n\nIn order to maintain good health, it is important to consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from each of the macronutrient groups. This will provide the body with the nutrients it needs to function properly and stay healthy.",

        "text": "Nutritional health refers to the impact of the food and drink we consume on our overall health and wellbeing. Ensuring that we have good nutritional health is important for maintaining a healthy body and preventing a range of chronic diseases.\n\nThere are several key elements to good nutritional health. The first is to ensure that we are consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods from each of the major food groups, including fruits and vegetables, grains, protein sources, and dairy products. It is also important to limit our intake of processed and sugary foods, which can be high in calories and low in nutrients.\n\nIn addition to following a balanced diet, it is also important to pay attention to portion sizes. Consuming too much food, even healthy food, can lead to weight gain and other health problems. On the other hand, not consuming enough food can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health issues.\n\nAnother aspect of good nutritional health is staying hydrated. It is important to drink enough water throughout the day to keep our bodies hydrated and functioning properly. Water is essential for many of the body's processes, including regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and removing waste.\n\nOverall, good nutritional health is an important component of maintaining overall health and wellbeing. By paying attention to what we eat and drink, and making sure to consume a balanced diet and stay hydrated, we can help our bodies stay strong and healthy.",

I figure this might include vegetables or fruits. I am looking for something that is generalist, well-balanced and not too crazy. \n\nPretty sure just about anything will be an upgrade to eating out and picking up junk food on campus every day for years, but searching for info about this online has been very overwhelming as there are a billion different recommendations. If possible I am just looking for simple recipes with stuff I can pick up at the grocery store and throw in my blender when I get up. I appreciate any pointers, recommendations or insight.
