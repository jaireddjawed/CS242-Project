While I love my job, I've found that I really miss going to school and think I'll apply for a lit program MA in the next year or two.  Before doing that, I really feel like I'd benefit from better understanding literary studies/critical theory (I'm not even sure if there's a difference between the two).  I took an intro to critical theory class in college and I didn't understand it all.  I felt that there was too much thrown at me too fast and while I feel pretty solid about Claude Levi-Strauss's \"The Structural Study of Myth,\" I feel like I barely learned anything from that class (As a side note, I actually really enjoyed his essay--it was one of the only essays I actually read for that class).  As a result, while I feel confident to discuss basic things like tone/theme/plot/figurative language/symbols in literature, I don't understand what people are talking about when they start referencing what I understand to be philosophy as it applies to literature or language.  I don't have a good basis for philosophy or critical theory and I don't know how to build it.  What would you suggest I read to help build that basis and begin to understand and appreciate critical theory? Or are there any good introductory podcasts or YouTube videos you would suggest?\n\nTL;DR - What should I read as a beginner's guide to critical theory? ",

Prominent authors - like Alexander Pope - were also trying to emulate the elegant writing of classicists, while philosphers were constantly finding inspiration from classical Rome and Greece for new political ideas. The concept of a 'Republic' is just one such idea off the top of my head. And hence, this is why the early half of the century is called the Augustan Age. That all makes sense to me.\n\nHowever I am struggling to understand what the second half of the century constituted. Currently I understand the latter 18th Century (the so-called 'Age of Sensibilty) to be simply a transition period between Enlightenment-influenced literature and the beginnings of Romanticism. Is this all there is to it?\n\nI don't need a particularly detailed run-down on the differences between the two periods.",

I find this to me be a far more important theme of the text than it, say, realistically depicting the lives, events and overarching world of Tom Jones. But perhaps I've misunderstood the realist dimensions of it. \n\nSo, I guess my questions are: what exactly is it about Tom Jones that makes it realist? and how do you think Fielding's narratorial interventions help to problematise/undermine/aid its relationship with realism? \n\nThanks",

        "text": "In this I connect OMAM to Democracy and how the character's relations are similar to relationships in government.\n\n*Prompt*: Pick a character from the book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck and analyze how he or she represents a part of the typical American Dream (or the reality of that dream). Your essay should include a description of the typical dream as well as a detailed explanation of how your character connects to at least one idea within this “dream.”\n\n**The American Dream and its Devolution**\n\nHope has been the vessel on which many people, of all nationalities, have persistently sailed uncharted seas with. It has been the gust of wind to stoke the fire of humanity, and has been very present in the American Dream. The American Dream is a universal hope that many Americans still have today; one of working to achieve wealth, comfort, and, in that time, land. In *Of Mice and Men* by John Steinbeck, Lennie represents the hope, blindness, and reality of the American Dream. It was accountable for many of the violent actions the characters took, and was responsible for their outcomes. Lennie, and how he dies, are prime examples of Steinbeck’s negative view of the American Dream and what it meant for America. \n\n\nLennie’s portrayal in Of Mice and Men resembles Steinbeck’s beliefs of the dream and its unattainability. Throughout the story, Lennie is described as strong and dumb, possibly symbolizing the people and their gullibility. Lennie’s dream, one which he repeats constantly, is to, “‘Have a little place --an’ rabbits” (88). Curley’s wife, representing Steinbeck’s ideas, cries, “Don’t you think of nothin’ but rabbits?” (89), displaying the infatuation Americans have with the Dream, and also showing Steinbeck’s failed attempts to teach them of the reality, as Americans are too mind- numbingly obsessed with the Dream, just as Lennie’s character shows. Next, when Curley’s wife is killed, representing Steinbeck’s voice being silenced, George says, “‘Lennie never done it in meanness,’ he said. ‘All the time he done bad things, but never done one of ‘em mean.’”(95). This shows how Americans are irresponsible with their power, and Steinbeck was silenced only to keep the Dream alive. \n\n\nWhen George is faced with the decision of whether or not to kill Lennie, Lennie continues to look into the distance, into the future, as he makes George, “‘Tell it how it’s [the dream] gonna be,’”(105). As George holds the gun to Lennie’s head and recites their dream, it represents the government’s false promises as they stomp on the people and keep them from achieving their goal. This relationship of government and people is also displayed when George says to Lennie, “‘I could get along so easy and nice if I didn’t have you on my tail,’” (7). This shows how the government treats its people: as a nuisance and a handicap, when really its strength is necessary to the government, or George’s, success. Through these three characters, Steinbeck represents the government, the people, and himself, along with their relationship with one another. \n\n\nSteinbeck's beliefs and worries regarding the devolution of the American Dream are illustrated in “Let America Be America Again”, a poem by Langston Hughes. Through this poem, the falseness of the American Dream is exploited. Hughes connects to Steinbeck when he writes, “I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,” showing the deceit of the American culture, as it teaches white people they are superior, when in fact this brings them nothing more than segregation. Next Hughes mentions the American Dream, after many years of constant use, in its tarnished and broken state, as he says, “...clutching the hope I seek-- And finding the same old stupid plan.” This supports Steinbeck, as Lennie holds tightly and relentlessly to his dream, but finds only death. Through the poem Steinbeck’s radical ideas are supported, and the decline of the American Dream’s strength becomes a more tangible idea. \n\n\nThrough Lennie and George’s relationship, Steinbeck shows the people’s, or Lennie’s, need for the government, as it needs the reason of the government to function properly, while the government, or George, needs the strength of the people to govern. Steinbeck represents himself and his thoughts through Curley’s Wife, as shows how he was silenced by the people through her death. Hughes’s poem also connects to and agrees with Steinbeck's radicality, and represents Lennie through his portrayal of the fooled people in his poem. Through these interactions, Steinbeck shows the American Dream, the people’s obsession with it, and the government’s mistreatment of the people.\n\n",

(Nonchristain interpreters please, otherwise I suspect there will be some interpretative bias' on this passage). \n\n-----\n\n&gt;KJV Romans 10:3-4 -they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end (telos) of the law for righteousness to every one that believe.\n\n&gt;3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.\n\n&gt;4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\n\n&gt;5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.\n\n&gt;6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)\n\n&gt;7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)\n\n&gt;8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\n\n&gt;9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\n\n&gt;10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n\n&gt;11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\n\n&gt;12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.\n \n-----\n\nRomans 10:4 also describes the same function that the law serves in Galatians. The word telos can mean the end goal or objective. One might ask a college student, “To what end are you attending college?” The word “end” in that context would refer to the “objective” or “goal” the student has in mind. Receiving a degree would be only the “end result” of his college years of learning, not the end to his ability or desire to learn. This is very clear in the NKJV Version’s rendering of 1 Timothy 1:5 where telos is properly translated as purpose in the clause “the purpose of the commandment is love.” In this same verse the NRSV translates telos as “aim,” the NIV renders it as “goal.”\n\nA good analogy would be the following:\nA college diploma is the end of college courses in the same way Christ is the end of the law.\n \nAlso, notice the preceding verse and its connection: the Jews “were ignorant of and did not submit themselves unto faith in Jesus” (which is what the “righteousness of God” is - Rom. 3:22; Phil 3:9). The issue of this passage was righteousness by faith verses righteousness by the law (as seen in verses 5-6). **Lastly, reading backwards from verse 12 we notice each start of a sentence is a conjunction - the point in verse 12 connects back to the idea in verse 4. \"Everyone\" in verse four thus refers to both Jews and Greeks.**",

        "text": "I'm starting my first MA-level paper for a course on Chaucer. My angle to tackle The Canterbury Tales is this--performing gender in narrative, love, sexuality, and dominance in The Wife of Bath's Prologue.\n\nRationale:\nI would like to frame The Wife of Bath's Prologue through the lens of performance studies and the concept of the agentic woman.\n\nMy rough outline:\nPerformativity can be observed in\n\n* Narratology - in that her digressions, garrulousness, her stream of consciousness mode/confessional, her losing her train of thought, are all gendered ways of writing women in literature.\n\n* Sexuality as an agentic woman through seduction and flirting, through feigning sexual pleasure and showing off beauty, through not having children and being demanding in bed\n\n* Love for older and younger husbands\n\n* An apotheosis of her agency: Dominance. Apart from what we've all read about her behavior, I'd like to argue that she performs in the way she dresses and in the 'servants' which she has\n\nSo my question is, after this long \"preamble\" (as the Friar would say), are there any texts on performativity in writing, female sexuality, love, and female dominance?\n\nI've only been working on the agentic woman sections of this final paper. So far, I know that I'll use Baudrillard for seduction. I'll also read Deleuze and Guatari's notions of the body.\n\nAs for the performativity aspect, I only have two articles I have yet to read: Holly A. Crocker's \"Performative Passivity and Fantasies of Masculinity in the 'Merchant's Tale' \" + \"The Problem of the Performative in Chaucer's Prioress Sequence\" by William Orth.\n\nThank you for anyone's help on this! I'm looking to submit this by May. Have a great day!",
