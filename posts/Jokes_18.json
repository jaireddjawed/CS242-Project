Karen explains that it was all a test, that she needed to make sure he had good character before she would hire him. ‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou got the job!‚Äù So he signs on for the job, goes home, still shocked and a little confused.\nAnyways, it all just goes to show that Sharon is Karen.",
