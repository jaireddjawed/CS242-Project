What are some cheap ways I can improve the quality of the water or help the wildlife?\nApart from the obvious like removing rubbish and all that.\nThanks\n\nEDIT:\nSo I ended up clearing sections of the stream, removing rubbish, debris, a lot of dead wood and plants, and any sticks/leaves blocking the flow, over a few hours. I came back two days later and water had turned from murky black to almost clear - it made a huge difference. A lot of the bubbly, oily murk is drifting away.\nA load of neighbours and dog-walkers have smiled and said hi, they were happy someone was clearing things up.",

One of my other friends is contacting the town board, and were still figuring out what trees were going to use/how were going to raise money if this goes through.\n\nI guess I was just going to ask if you had any ideas for the project? Right now our goals are kind of loosely defined. Basically were gonna say \"okay theres so and so trees in all the parks, we want this number\". but the project can really take any direction. \n\nOne of my ideas was a poetry project where one tree in each park would have a sign with poetry related to nature/conservation.\n\nI also think we might be in over our heads with this whole idea, but its worth a shot! Every little bit of help counts. Thanks",
