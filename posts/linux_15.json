Maybe it's not as clean and detailed like Helvum but it get it's stuff done.\n\nThe scroll wheel of you mouse can change the volume of a device, a middle click (un)mutes it and with a right click you can set a device as default (or delete a virtual one), everything is based around mouse-input.\n\nI've written this thing in Pascal which isn't anything normal these days, additionally I was very lazy in structuring my code or to keep it readable, but since I've got this thing with little changes running since 2015 I'm \"okayish\" with this state.\n\nGit: [https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio\\_mngr](https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio_mngr)\n\nCompiled binaries in: [https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio\\_mngr/tree/master/bin](https://github.com/Sfaizst/audio_mngr/tree/master/bin)\n\nThanks for feedback.\n\nIf the feedback isn't overly negative I might consider trying to teach myself how to pack this thing in a appimage, flatpack or whatever kind of a distro package, I just don't really know how to do this.\n\nHere is a screenshot that basically shows it's capabilities:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwpf67sh5nha1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f77d4eb36ff14b3ed1337e5bbbf9eab0956c449e",

It uses [segmentio/go-kafka](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) internally, which means `CGO` can be disabled during compilation.\n\nThis makes it very portable, especially when using `scratch`-based container images.\n\nYou can get full details in the [README](https://github.com/comradequinn/klient#readme) and you can download pre-built binaries for your preferred system [here](https://github.com/comradequinn/klient#installation)\n\nAppreciate there's some other options out there, but I hope some of you find it useful :-)",

The server runs AFP software to be visible as a TimeMachine backup to the MacBook and NFS for connection with my PC.  We also have some 'common' files on this server that we can share or simply don't need to have on either personal PC.  I don't have any Windows machines at home so the file server does not run SAMBA.\n\nAs the machine is aging and I am seeing SMART errors from the drives but nothing to be overly concerned about now (especially since it is a RAID pair).  I am toying with the idea of making the next iteration of this file server a standalone NAS and moving the web server to a small standalone system (like a PI).\n\nCan anyone share their experiences with a home or small-business version of a NAS (3 TB or so) that can support our Mac backup needs (via TimeMachine) and my NFS connection?  How is setup and how is reliability?  How easy was it to connect your PCs to this NAS?   Would you make the same choice if you had to do this again?  Any other comments about your experiences?\n\nThanks!",
