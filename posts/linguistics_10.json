A researcher in Colombia University explained that the prerequisite to true AI is the need for machines to develop self awareness or specifically the ability to \"imagine\" themselves  in their surroundings. That ability, apparently, is how we humans adapt to our surroundings and deal creatively with challenges. I'm linguistically inclined so the first question that occurred to me was whether we humans use the language we speak \"tell ourselves\" who and where we are. The alternative would be that this function of the brain is 100% sensory and therefore 0% verbal. \n\nBut if our spoken language is involved in determining how we perceive ourselves and so shapes our self awareness, that means that computers using different programming languages will end up performing their jobs differently. To me that's a fascinating thought.",

Have fun!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzle #1**\n\n(by Tom Payne, slightly shortened)\n\nChickasaw is an American Indian language of the Muskogean language family. Currently, there are about 3,000 fluent speakers of Chickasaw, most of whom live in Oklahoma.\n\nNote: The sound represented as ã is a \"nasalized\" vowel. It is pronounced like the \"a\" in \"father,\" but with the air passing through the nose, as in the French word \"ban.\"\n\n1. Ofi'at kowi'ã lhiyohli. - 'The dog chases the cat.'\n\n2. Kowi'at ofi'ã lhiyohli. - 'The cat chases the dog.'\n\n3. Ofi'at shoha. - 'The dog stinks'\n\n4. Ihooat hattakã hollo. - 'The woman loves the man.'\n\n5. Lhiyohlili. - 'I chase her/him.'\n\n6. Salhiyohli. - 'She/he chases me.'\n\n7. Hilha. - 'She/he dances.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can translate the following into Chickasaw:\n\nThe man loves the woman\n\nThe cat stinks\n\nI love her/him\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslate the following into English:\n\nIhooat sahollo\n\nOfi'at hilha\n\nKowi'ã lhiyohlili\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Short answer:*\n\n&gt;!The man loves the woman = Hattakat ihooã hollo!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The cat stinks = Kowi’at shoha!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I love her/him = Holloli!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ihooat sahollo = The woman loves me!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ofi'at hilha = The dog dances!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kowi'ã lhiyohlili = I chase the cat!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thinking:\n\n&gt;!1. Root correspondences are straightforward:  ofi'- = dog (after comparing the first three phrases); kowi'- = cat;  Ihoo- = woman;  hattak- man. The affixes are /-at/ for the subject and /-ã/ for the object. He/she don’t seem to be explicitly used.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3. Verbs are a bit trickier: not enough forms to figure out the exact roots. But the forms we have a simple: shoha = stinks; hollo = loves; hilha = dances; lhiyohli = chases; lhiyohlili = I chase; salhiyohli = I’m being chased. Meaning that actions by me end in /-li/ and actions directed at me start with /sa-/.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzle #2**\n\n(by Kibrik A.Ye., adapted)\n\nLak is a Northeast Caucasian language, one of six standardized languages of Dagestan spoken by about 157,000 people.\n\nBelow are different forms of the Lak word for “house” (in simplified transliteration) with their translations and examples of use:\n\nkatluvu — in the house — I am in the house\n\nkatluhuh — behind the house and along it — I pass by the house behind it\n\nkatluvatu — from/out of the house — I go out of the house\n\nkatlulu — under the house — I am under the house\n\nkatluy — on the house — I am on the house, (i.e. on the roof)\n\nkatluvun — into the house — I come into the house\n\nkatluhatu — from behind the house — I come from behind the house\n\nkatlulun — under the house — I go under the house (i.e. into the basement/cellar)\n\nkatluyh — over the house (leaving it under) — I walk over the house (= on the roof)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Translate into Lak:*\n\nfrom under the house - I come from under the house\n\nthrough the house - I go through the house\n\nonto the house - I go up onto the house (= to the roof)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Short answer:* &gt;!from under the house = katlulatu; through the house = katluvuh; onto the house = katluyn!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thinking:\n\n&gt;!1. Katlu- is always unchanged and seems to be the root that can have either one or two affixes attached to it, where the first one indicates position relative to the house and the second indicates direction. Cf. katlu-vu \"in the house\" vs. katlu-vu-n \"(go) into the house\" vs. katlu-lu-n \"(go) under the house\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2. When trying to summarize the two sets of affixes, we get two forms for \"behind\", /ha/ and /hu/, and two forms for \"inside\", /va/ and /vu/, both times with /u/ turning into /a/ before /tu/ for \"from/out of/ . To resolve this, we can assume that the vowel before /tu/ always changes to /a/, giving us the following sets:!&lt;\n\n&gt;!vu = in; hu = behind; lu = under; y = on;!&lt;\n\n&gt;!h = along; (a)tu = from/out of; n = to, into!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3. To form \"from under the house\", we need to figure out /lu/+/atu/. Applying the same logic as in /vatu/ and /hatu/, we get /katlu-l-atu/. \"Through the house\" is a bit tricky and I actually got it wrong: my answer was /katluh/, although it makes sense that when you're walking through the house you're inside it, and the literal translation would've been \"through the inside of the house\".!&lt;",

Notice the key words “Arabic Languages” implying that Arabic isn’t a single language.\n\nThis post fascinates me. I always keep returning back to it. As an Arab myself, it was certainly a culture shock that the vernaculars we speak may be considered separate languages. It featured many linguists’ theories on the Arabic dialects and which group do Semitic languages are they and yadda yadda yadda. It also said that the Arabic dialects don’t descended from Standard or Classical Arabic, but rather from Old Arabic.\n\nTo my knowledge, Old Arabic isn’t Arabic. It is a language that is Arabic’s ancestor. It also was a group of Semitic dialects rather than a single unified language. Old Hejazi was one of these dialects. I also heard that the Quran is written in the Old Hejazi dialect that was standardized by Othman bin ‘Afan may Allah be pleased with him.\n\nIs the Quran written in the Old Hejazi dialect? Does this mean that the Quran is written in Old Arabic? Do the modern vernaculars actually descend from Old Arabic? If so, wouldn’t that make them separate yet closely related languages like English and Scots? If so, then this technically means that my dialect ( Egyptian Arabic ) is a sister language to Standard Arabic, Lebanese Arabic, Moroccan Arabic and many many more.",

        "text": "Hi, I'm learning Modern Hebrew, and I'm trying to understand the historical origins of its complicated vocalization patterns.\n\nIn Hebrew, there is a class of nouns called segolates, which are characterized by being stressed on the penultimate syllable. They have the form CVCVC (normally CeCeC) and come from Proto-Semitic (PS) \\*CVCC, where the last two consonants are different. An example is מֶלֶךְ mélekh \"king\" &lt; PS \\*malk-. The original form malk- is retained in (e.g.) the feminine form מַלְכָּה malká(h). It seems to me, then, that PS \\*CaCC became Hebrew CéCeC in order to resolve the coda (CVCC being an unacceptable syllable), but it remains unchanged when followed by a vowel. What I do not understand is why the plural comes up as מְלָכִים m(ə)lakhím with vocalization CəCaC-, instead of simply malkhím. Where does the a come from? Does this plural stem CəCaC- come from something other than \\*CaCC? Is this a Hebrew innovation?\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "I'll first present you with a personal anecdote and then ask a few general questions about L2 speakers. Mind you, the anecdote isn't meant to support any claim, as I'm not making any, but rather to explain what it is that I'm asking.\n\nThe anecdote: I am an ESL speaker who has lived in the United States for nine years and has (according to my peers) developed native-like fluency and accent, and I speak a varient of American English which quite easily pinpoints me as a northeasterner. However, the more I've been immersing myself in the local parlance, the more I've found myself making mistakes that I would have never imagined myself making but years prior. A few notable examples are the spellings of homophones, as I often find myself accidentally confusing the likes of &lt;your&gt; and &lt;you're&gt;, and my unwitting adoption of the increasingly popular &lt;have went&gt;. My understanding of grammar hasn't lessened since I first came to the United States: on the contrary, I've developed an interest in linguistics and conlanging, so I actually know more about (English) grammar than I knew when I was studing English back in my home country.\n\nThe question: what could have caused this? My (rudimentary) hypothesis is that by learning English through sheer immersion I picked up mistakes from native speakers, as I was no longer in a formal environment that constantly tested my ability to speak the 'proper' language. Does this hypothesis have any merit? Is there any research on this topic, whereby L2 speakers of various languages are observed and their tendency to make native-like mistakes is perhaps positively correlated with their perceived fluency by native speakers, all while their tendency to make mistakes linked to their native tongue is decreased?\n\nP.S.: I'm not qualified to discuss to what extent the \"mistakes\" I brought up are really mistakes and not a natural evolution of the particular English dialect I speak, but most are certainly treated as mistakes by all native speakers I've conversed with - when we notice them, that is!",

I just noticed something, and was curious if someone could share their knowledge on this.\n\nEnglish seems to be the only west-european language that I'm speaking where the word \"Library\" doesn't mean the place where you buy book, instead they use bookshop.\nItalian and Spanish have liberia (í) and French has librairie. German kind of uses the logic found in the word \"bookshop\", in \"Buchhandlung\", which could be seen as a logical continuation of the Latin \"taberna libraria\" (place to buy books). Then again, the Latin word is older, and would have been known in Britain when the Romans where around.\n\nIm curious: How is today's english the only of these languages where the word \"library\" exists (the obviously older word), but isn't used for the place to buy books, instead they use (like in German logic) book shop?",

        "text": "Is there any work done on testing weak linguistic relativism in the context of answering questions, especially under pressure? I saw this [clip](https://youtu.be/zcoolAQfCy0?t=16) where a Canadian game show contestant answered “hen” when asked “besides a chicken, name something that lays eggs” under time pressure. Hen most often means female domestic chicken, or, less often, a blanket term for any female bird other than chicken, neither of which sounds like an adequate answer to the question. However, anecdotally, if a language at issue simply uses “female chicken” for a hen, it seems less likely for someone to answer that question with “female chicken”, because it seems too obvious that a female chicken is a chicken, while a hen may sound less intuitively apparent to be a chicken. What is more interesting is that among the 100 Canadian people being surveyed, presumably under less or no pressure, 3 people said “hen”, which shows that pressure may not be the only factor contributing to the phenomenon.\n\nIt can be priming (because chicken and hen are under the same category, the mentioning of chicken triggers the thinking of hen, if this is what you mean). But a relativist analysis may hypothesize that the exact opposite has happened: his mind has previously put hen under a category other than chicken, because on the face of it, there is no apparent similarity between the word hen and chicken. When asked something other than chicken in a hurry, he decided that hen was something other than chicken because the two words were under different categories. So he has actually correctly answered the other than part of the question in this regard. But the mind of a language calling a hen “female chicken” may put “chicken” and “female chicken” under the same category, so the above would not have happened, because on the face of it, the word “chicken” would not have looked apparently different from “female chicken”.\n\n[https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01637](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01637)\n\nTwo lines of literature on the influence of linguistic categories on cognition and perception, for and against, are summarized in Introduction of the above paper. However, even if either (or neither) of them is valid, the present question is fundamentally different in that the situation is not showing participants pairs of pictures to determine their similarity, and that semantically chicken already includes hen while e.g. bean and pea are (alleged to be) in semantically different categories, so the concept of so-called linguistic categorization (as previously experimented) cannot be directly applied here.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/10kjyu6/what_determines_whether_some_people_can_speak/",
        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been wondering for a while what makes some people naturally better than others at emulating the native pronunciation in foreign languages. Why is it that some people learning e.g. English as a foreign language will be naturally better at speaking with more American or British accent, and some people will have a very thick accent typical to where they come from (e.g. German, Italian or Polish)? \n\nOf course, when speaking in a foreign language, almost everyone will have some sort of accent, and it would be difficult to lose it completely. What determines one's accent in foreign languages is mostly their own native language or the types of sounds they are used to speaking. But I'm sure you know some people who have the same native background as others and yet their accent is much less strong. This can be observed already in children learning English as a foreign language. From what I've noticed, if someone is good at emulating native pronunciation of one language, they will be also good at emulating the native pronunciation of another foreign language. So this 'plasticity' of pronunciation does not seem to be restricted to just one tongue. What is more, people from the same country - or even family - can have vastly different levels of accent 'thickness' in the same foreign language.\n\nMy first theory about what causes this disparity in the acquisition of 'native' pronunciation may be that some people are more gifted with distinguishing and emulating sounds they hear. If that's the case, then it would follow that musicians or people who are naturally good at music and singing should have accents that are less noticeable. But from my own personal experience that is not the case, or at least being gifted with music does not necessitate being good at accents. I have observed also the vice versa -- people gifted with musical abilities can have very strong accents.\n\nAnother thing that I also have noticed is that one's accent in a foreign language can easily change. I've noticed that learning new foreign languages can actually shift one's previously 'good' accent in the language we were acquiring before. I know a person who's accent in English became much thicker after they started learning Swedish, and they have now a hard time going back to how they used to speak in English. At the same time, their pronunciation in Swedish is superior to most people in the learning group, and they sound quite 'native' compared to other students. Perhaps is not that common for another foreign language to change one's accent in another language, but I have come across a couple of similar examples.\n\nI know that these examples are anecdotal and they don't prove anything, but I wanted to present my own experiences. I am very intigued about what exactly makes some people naturally better at accents. Do you have any ideas why some people are just naturally predisposed to sound more 'native' in the foreign languages they acquire? Is it just that those people try harder and pay more attention to pronunciation, or is there something else to it?",

In Crimea, there are several ethnic groups with different languages and cultures.\n\nDuring 1600s all these ethnic groups were under a rapid Tatarization process, for instance, Urums a Greek ethnic group in Crimea today speak a Tatar dialect and almost half of them are assimilated into Crimean Tatars which today they known as Yaliboyu Tatars (Coast Tatars). Centuries after Crimean Khanate, some Urums started speaking mainland Greek language to preserve their identity.\n\nOn the other hand, there are people known as Crimean Tat people (a branch of Crimean Tatars) who are descendant from Crimean Ostrogothic people who were Tatarized, their region called Magnup Qale which means the Castle of Gothia. Today, Karaites can speak Israeli Hebrew, Urums can speak mainland Greek but Tats cannot speak Gothic (because it's extinct) or they cannot claim to be descendant from Goths even tho they have ancestry from Goths.\n\nToday Gothic language extinct therefore Gothic people extinct too, even they exist with a different language. I first thought Gutnish is their mother language. Can we say language and ethnicity are necessarily directly related. While a certain language may be spoken by a particular ethnic group, it is possible for individuals or groups to speak a language that is not considered to be their ethnic language. But these actions soon or later intend them to be assimilated as far as i see.\n\nThere are dozens of different European settlers in US who trace their own ancestry from all over Europe but they use English as a lingua franka and they are just consider themselves as whites.",

        "text": "I am new here and not sure if this is an appropriate place to post this inquiry, so I apologize in advance if that's the case, but I am looking to build and open source phoneme/viseme recognition system that is designed to run locally in realtime.\n\nI started off as a passionate game/XR developer and I decided I wanted to make my own social VR platform. To learn some concepts and build systems gradually, I decided to create a personal little VTubing software with basic features and a speech to viseme system so I could get away from using the Oculus Lip Sync library that is so common in the VR space. I wasn't aware that phoneme detection is pretty much an entire field of speech and audio study and now I'm even more intrigued.\n\nSo, I come to ask if anyone could provide resources, research, existing libraries that I might be able to learn from and use to further my idea. I've already been researching for a couple weeks but I think asking a group of people who might be especially interested in this would also be a good idea.",

Some friends from home thought I should have had an 'American' accent by now. Are they linguistically correct?   \n\n\nI Googled it and feels like there are conflicting opinions about this topic. Some said it's impossible to get rid of an accent because you fully developed it very young (age 6). But I have heard a plethora of  people sounding perfectly British or American as a non-native English learner. Is there any research to suggest one way or the other?",
