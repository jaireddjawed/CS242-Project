I found myself thinking about the colossal amounts of time and energy that would go into creating these beautiful books. It was like being in an art gallery (only you were allowed to touch the paintings and squeak your shoes in this gallery). I had a completely new appreciation for the gorgeous images in those books - so many any able to tell a story and convey thoughts and emotions without a single printed word.\n\nTwo hours later, I got a call from my wife, asking if all was well. I completely lost track of time, happily consumed by the imaginations of Eric Carle, Tomie dePaola, Chris van Allsburg, Jane Yolen, Ludwig Bemelmans, \nLois Ehlert, Jerry Pinkney…the list goes on and on…\n\nWhat are some of your favorite picture books? I want to fill our library!",

Lilith and Naamah were characters in it though I don’t recall what roles they play. The only main plot points I remember are there was a seed(I believe of the Tree of Life) and that Maia was locked up in Sheol and she managed to escape and get the seed. Literally everything else is a blank. I believe it may have been a Christian fiction in the vain of Frank Peretti.

The beer gave her the same feeling with almost no wait.”\n-Elizabeth Harmon\n\nAt the end of the final episode the credits show that The Queen’s Gambit is an adaptation of a novel written by Walter Tevis, a writer I had never heard of.\n\nSo I looked him up.\n\nWalter Tevis wrote 'The Hustler' which was adapted into a successful Paul Newman film. He wrote 'The Color of Money’ which was adapted by Martin Scorsese, starring Tom Cruise. He wrote The Queen’s Gambit. Published in 1983, a year before his death. And he graduated from The Iowa Writers’ Workshop. My dream school.\n\nI got a Kindle copy because buying paperbacks of lesser known authors in Dubai is expensive. At the end of my first reading I knew it wouldn’t be my last.\n\n“How old were you when you started playing?”\n“Five. I was District Champion at seven. I hope to be a World Champion one day.”\n“When?”\n“In three years.”\n“You'll be sixteen in three years. If you win, what will you do afterward?”\nHe looked confused.\n“I don't understand.”\n“If you're a World Champion at sixteen, what will you do with the rest of your life?”\nHe still looked confused.\n“I don't understand.”\n- Elizabeth Harmon &amp; Georgi Girev\n\nI watched The Queen’s Gambit for the second time with my mother. Hindi dubbed. Not only were the translations hilarious. But, when Beth goes through her booze &amp; pills bender, smoking and dancing around in nothing but her underwear, my mother, astonished, said in Hindi,\n\n“What is this dirty girl doing!?”\n\nBut when the credits rolled, my mum had that private smile we all know when we’ve experienced something memorable.\n\n“My experience has taught me that what you know isn’t always important.”\n“What is important?”\n“Living and growing. Living your life.”\n- Alma Wheatley &amp; Elizabeth Harmon\n\nI’ve just finished reading The Queen’s Gambit for the second time in paperback. And I can’t help but feel raw.\n\nI love this story.\n\nIt’s something I’ve always needed when I’ve had to get back up.\n\nFrom anxiety.\nFrom fear.\nFrom vice &amp; self loathing.\n\nThe simple way to describe The Queen’s Gambit is to say it’s a story about chess. Or a story about feminism. Or as Scott Frank (director &amp; writer of The Netflix show and interestingly the screenplay writer of the Oscar nominated superhero film ‘Logan’) describes it - a story about the cost of genius.\n\nBut to me it means so much more.\n\nIt’s a story about comebacks. Of heartbreak and triumph. Of a prodigy who is unbelievably relatable. Because the traumatic price of her talents is not one I’d wish on my worst foe.\n\nIt’s a story about gender. Of how important it is to see someone just like you accomplishing the incredible.\n\nIt’s a story about camaraderie. Of sportsmanship. Of mutual respect between people who don’t merely differ within a country’s political spectrum, but literally come from separate sides of the monolithic Iron Curtain.\n\nIt’s a story about passion. Of the romance found within 64 squares. Of the hard work required mentally, physically, and spiritually to be the best. And as derivative as that sounds of any other Hero’s Journey, The Queen’s Gambit has some uniquely charismatic trademarks.\n\nThe Language: Simple as Hemingway’s. But with a depth that rivals ancient haiku.\nThe Narrative: Opening. Midgame. Endgame. Engineered like a rare watch.\nThe Characters: Alma Wheatley is the friend-mother we all wish for. Benny Watts flips the femme fatale archetype to homme fatale and gives a romantic challenge as intriguing as chess.\n\nAnd Borgov.\n\n“There’s one player that scares me. The Russian.”\n- Elizabeth Harmon\n\nVasily Borgov. Even the name makes the air around it tremble.\n\nWorld Champion.\nGrandmaster.\nAscetic as a razor.\n\nAnd eyes that bore into you like a sniper.\n\nNever before has an antagonist been built up with so much quiet terror.\n\nThere are other characters (Jolene, Shaibel) that I want to avoid describing to leave something new for first time readers and viewers.\n\nWhich brings me to the question:\n\nShould you watch The Queen’s Gambit?\nOr\nshould you read the novel?\n\nMy honest opinion is this:\n\nI envy those that have yet to discover the novel for the first time completely unfamiliar.\n\nAnd,\nI’m very glad for the unique poignance of the Netflix show.\n\nIrrespective of my biases,\nI don’t think you could go wrong.\n\nBoth mediums are brilliant.\n\nFrankly,\nbooks are just the delivery system.\nThe story is what matters.\n\nAnd The Queen’s Gambit is a story that definitely delivers.",

I cry easily during emotional moments while watching movies, and I just assume it's because film itself is just naturally a more visceral experience for the brain than reading text on a page (at least, that's been my experience). \n\nWhile certain novels have given me heartache, sadness, or even feelings of hollowness that remained days after finishing them, I've never had the experience of actually *crying* after or while reading a book. It's been my thought that the day this happens for me I will have found myself in possession of some genuinely masterful writing. I was wondering if any of you have experienced this and if so, which story did it for you? Was there something special about the writing or story that set it apart from others you've read?",

        "text": "Let me preface by saying I’m appreciative of what Hobb is trying to do with this series. I also truly enjoyed Assassins’ Apprentice. So if you love these books your opinion is valid. And if you bristles at the mere thought of someone criticizing them, then please stop reading this. \n\nMy intention is not to rile any one up. I’m just trying to make sense of the disconnect I’m having between the jubilant praise I’ve heard for this book and my own experience with it as I near the end. \n\nI guess I should’ve seen some warning signs in Assassin’s’ Apprentice that this series might not be for me.\n\nThere were some things that just didn’t track with how Hobb had established the characters. For example, Fitz, who was trained to observe every tiny detail and has what amounts to a physic connection to animals, cannot identify a Duchess and her dog in the kitchen. And, probably more central to the plot, the proud and close knit Mountain kingdom being like, “Hum, someone assassinated our Prince. But it’s inconclusive who the culprit is so we’ll just let it slide.”  \n\nSure, it doesn’t track and Fitz’s maneuverings to uncover a painfully obvious scheme were clumsy at best… but c’mon… Fitz gets saved by Nosey 😭 so, much like the mountain Kingdom I was good to let that slide.  \n\nThen we get to Royal Assassin. I thought it also had some really strong moments. But by and large those were outweighed by a meandering narrative and a bevy of head scratching moments.    \n\nFor example, Hobb kept setting up obstacles, going to great lengths to establish their difficulty, then almost instantly solving them through no volition of the driving characters. E.g. Fitz has to figure out a way to get all the guards out of Shrewds’ chamber so they can take Shrewd out of the keep. How does Fitz accomplish this? A ruse, trickery, his assassin skills? Nope. There just aren’t guards there.  There are many similar examples.\n\nCharacters also take actions regularly that don’t really track. Like Hobb establishes that Molly is fiercely independent, wants to open her own chandlery, and doesn’t see a place for her and Fitz in the world. Surely there must be some big shift that takes place to change her mind? Nope. Fitz just climbs through her window, and like two hours later she’s saying she’s his wife.  \n\nBut young people are impetuous right? Well what about Verity, who puts his duty to his King and the six duchies above all else (at the expense of his personal life)? Verity who is powerful in the Skill in orders of magnitude more than the restrictively trained coterie? Verity who is sharing a damn Skill link as Fitz observes Shrewd’s deteriorating condition? Would Verity really have had no idea that two nascent skill users were leeching the life from his king?  \n\nI guess you can chalk it up to being distracted trying to protect the coast from Raiders…and for…other reasons of some sort…when Winter hits and the raids stop.  \n\nBut what about Fitz himself? This meticulously trained assassin who can make a death look like anything from an accident to a slow illness? Fitz who has little adeptness or even interest with a blade? Well, he trains with an axe for like a month and is suddenly this unkillable berserker.   \n\nIn fact, Fitz does so much berserking and so little assassinating, that I think this book should have been called Royal Berserker. Truly.\n\nI made it to the point where Fitz’s huge dilemma of how to get rid of the guards around Shrewd suddenly doesn’t exist. Then Fitz decides to Skill link Shrewd to Verity, an act which he knows will kill Shrewd, in an exposed room with no doors or locks that someone is virtually certain to walk into at any moment.  \n\nThen, after facilitating Shrewd’s final moments (if not the full arc of Shrewds’ death), Fitz decides to forgo all of his assassin training in favor of a clumsy berserker attack on the coterie members that culminates in a massive six duchies royal rumble.  \n\nHow poetic would it have been if Fitz used his assassin skills to produce a slow, painful death for Serene and … the other one…like the death they inflicted on Shrewd?  \n\nI guess I’m just frustrated. Hobb does so much right with this book. The world building is great. The wonderfully inventive power system of the Skill and the Wit. The mystery and intrigue surrounding the raiders. Nighteyes the wolf being a total Bro.  \n\nBut when it comes down to it this is a series that is framed as one revolving around political intrigue, maneuvering for power, and shadowy plots and dirty deeds to secure that power. And, like Fitz’s final attack on the coterie, these aspects of the book are clumsy and poorly thought out.\n\nLike I’m hard pressed to think of one legitimately clever thing Fitz did in the story. Or Regal for that matter. For the most part they both operate as blunt objects with extremely self centered prospectives, free from any real consequences for their actions (tbf a very accurate description of a lot of teenage boys).\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is I really want to like this series. But ultimately I’m left wondering if it’s just not for me and if I should even finish Royal Assassin. That and what teenage boy did Robin Hobb wrong.",

Maybe not the best, but really made me think. And the human vignettes in the first part.... Wow.\n- Middlesex - amazing\n- the Road - hard. But so good. But fucking hell.\n\nAnd then... The Goldfinch.\n\nIt started strong, strong enough I suppose. But then we just get... Lost. And I got lost. And everything gets tied up with a bow....\n\nWhatever deeper themes we were meant to be interrogating, they've been well trodden before. Pleasure of reading, it was ok at times... I really tried to dig in, and challenge myself, but as much as I dug in, nothing had substance, and the ending is so... Neat. Tidy.\n\nWhat am I missing? I've come to view the ok Pulitzer as the golden standard for quality in literature.\n\nWhat have I missed about the Goldfinch? Because surely I must be missing something. It was fine, serviceable, but underwhelming. Nothing more.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The paper covering is driving me bonkers because it’s just loosely there and I have to constantly shit it into place. I want to discard it and just have the hard cover because its absolutely beautiful, but I feel like it’s taboo to get rid of it. What are your thoughts on the matter?",

        "text": "I know I'm like eight years late, but this book was on the best-selling shelf of my library (eight years late!), and when I read the description and peeked at the prose, I knew I had to read it. After any piece of media I consume, I usually write a long summary of how I felt about it and then go around and read other threads about that same piece, but for this book, it was either a hit or miss for a lot of people and I don't really know if it was a hit or miss for me (that's a conversation for another day) but the negative comments didn't seem to really resonate with me and I disagreed with them to an extent that I decided to create a thread to address them. (I have many negative comments on this book, my main one being that I felt like I got desensitized to Jude's trauma because it was vv repetitive that the second-half of the book lost its substance) but let's go on.\n\n**Critique**: The idea that the book is unrealistic because of the trauma Jude went through (that after Brother Luke, he went to a camp where people abused him, went on truck rides where people abused him, and then met another person that abused him etc...)\n\n**Response:** I read somewhere (I forgot where) that the reason this happened is because after Brother Luke, Jude sort of became a magnet to these sort of people and to this situation in general and I agreed with it. After Brother Luke, Jude was filled with trauma and was filled with these distinct beliefs of himself and hated himself but conceded that this was who he was and this was who he always was. Adding on, the camp counselors knew what happened to Jude with Luke, so the fact that some of them took advantage of this fact and then him, should not seem unrealistic. And the idea again of the magnet, makes sense. This is who he believes he was, and he doesn't believe that he can ever be a person other than someone who has sex for things, so he naturally attracts or perhaps subconsciously seeks people that conform to this idea of himself. I agree that the Dr. Traylor bit was just like sudden that he would just be kidnapped, but it isn't unrealistic. I mean there are creeps in this world and Dr. Traylor was one of them who found an unaccompanied kid and then chose to bring him with him, gauge out his background, and then, take advantage of him. And it's not like everyone was bad to him, the people who tried to adopt him didn't ever abuse him. It's just that maybe the author put emphasis on these three core, bad parts of his life, to emphasize his trauma. But none of that is unrealistic. He was taught with Luke that this is who he is, and so he chose to accept it as he grew older, which meant he didn't fight this identity of his, so he found himself in more positions with these pedophiles because he accepted it, to an extent. We only think it's unrealistic because we don't believe that who we are is what Jude thought he was, so we wouldn't even be in these situations, but Jude did believe that that was what he was, and so that's why he was in many more scenarios where it conformed with his belief, if that makes sense.\n\n**Critique**: The idea that the book is depressing and that it shows that even if one is unconditionally loved, people who suffer substantial trauma are still better off as dead since they have no hope in this world.\n\n**Response:** First of all, Jude only began seriously contemplating suicide again after Willem's death. And the death of your close friend and your lover is already enough to make one depressed/borderline suicidal, and compounded with all his trauma, obviously he would be back in a dark place. I agree that this book gives little hope. But I mean, the people who give this critique are the same people who said they thought Jude's self-hatred was repetitive. So isn't the book more saying that those who keep giving into their past and their trauma and refuse to change their mindset about themselves are more doomed, rather than those just with the trauma that Jude had? So isn't it a bit more positive than we think. Jude refused to change his mind about himself despite this unconditional love, so it isn't a generalization to say that all people who suffer trauma will follow his depressing pattern and then end in suicide? People said how this book encouraged suicide and I see that. But I also think that it shows the effects of trauma and how sometimes, suicide seems like the only answer, and that sometimes after everything, it is. Maybe it's not encouraging suicide, but letting us as readers see the side of someone who suicided. What drove them to this?This book built so much empathy between readers and Jude that by the time he killed himself, we understood. Maybe it's telling us to look for warning signs of those who are suicidal or just giving us a glimpse of what is in their mind and understanding it. \n\nI think those were the two main critiques that I disagreed with! I have many of my own critiques and problems with this book :) but those are long-winded and I just finished the book yesterday so I need to process it a bit more.",

Most people claimed me to be one out of the joke that I kept to myself and had a book on me. Even with the joke of being a  bookworm, I didn't ever feel like I was. I do enjoy reading a book every now and then, but I don't constantly read as if  that's all I do in my life. \n\nEven with my own small explanation, I still ponder on the thought of what people's definition of a bookworm is. \n\nThat is why I kindly ask: what is a real bookworm?",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I hope you are all having a wonderful week and I wish you a great rest of one. Anyways, I decided to start getting more into the scene of reading and books. It was genuinely the best option in my life as I feel better about myself now that I started reading books. However, I was wondering until now what is the best or one of the best sites where you can buy books online in EUROPE and books in English only. I heard about Waterstones and Book Depository but that's pretty much it. So, I wonder if you all knew more sites other than those I just mentioned. I don't really mind the prince differences. I'm just more focused about the quality of the books. I don't mind if one site is way more expensive as long the quality is also higher and better. So, the quality is really my most important factor. \n\nThank you so much for taking your time to read this and help me. It means a lot to me. Again, I wish you a very great rest of your week, kind user! Thanks!",

I am surprised by how much I am enjoying it. I’m actually ahead. The characters intrigue me, and I am trying to figure out what mental health issue one of the characters has. I’ve never really read about physical abuse before, and I am actually excited to finish this one.",

I almost couldn't believe I was reading the words of a petty criminal from the 1950's. Did Capote take liberties with some of these letters/dialogue? Because some of it feels too good to be true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinuing on... the letters from Barbara and Perry's father were both very well written for people who supposedy had little to no education. It just blows me away. Was writing ability just comething that was of greater emphasis back then? Maybe I'm holding these characters (or people as I have to remind myself) in too high esteem. Such a great book though. This chapter with the correspondence from Perry's relatives just really struck a nerve with me.",
