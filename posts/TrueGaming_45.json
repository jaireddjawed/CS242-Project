While I like the term in that sense most of the time, I'm talking more in the *literal* sense. As in, taking into account your true surroundings, and what sort of thing would best help you make it through. \n\nThere's a lot of games that I absolutely love, but I'm not sure they would fit, in the literal sense, as a \"desert island\" game. For instance, I love any and all games within the Bioshock series, but given that they are at times linear, and also might be a bit too \"heavy\" to play 100% of the time, I'm not sure these would be great desert island games for me. \n\nWhat kind of game would you choose? What are good qualities in this case? Are open-world games definitely best? What about modern sports games, with their endless franchise modes or infinite outcomes?\n\nor....can you make one singular choice right away?\n\nAFTERTHOUGHT EDIT:  No multiplayer games at all.

        "text": "&gt; \"When was the last time that you had fun playing video-games?\"\n\nGreetings to you all, people of true-gaming. Yesterday, coming back from work, I was thinking about some reviews that I've watched. I really dig watching long commentaries of series like Dark Souls, Quake, Doom, Deus Ex and many other games - Some channels focus on long commentaries like these. Some of my favourites are:\n\n*  Noah Caldwell-Gervais\n*  Matthewmatosis\n*  Accursed Farms\n*  Joseph Anderson\n*  Zero Punctuation (Yahtzee's reviews are not that long, but his opinions are usually recicled through the series, ending up in various comparisons, so I'm putting him here as well.\n\n\nAnd many, many others.\n\n\n\nThere is something incredibly addicting about overanalysing video-games - Sometimes, by doing so, you end up discovering new and interesting things about the game - Dark Souls is a pretty good example of this, being overanalysed to the point of exaustion but, by doing that, we found a lot of interesting stuff about the game.\n\nBut that brings another problem to the table: I usually play games blindly, before watching any reviews, and if the game interests me enough, I'll go and search for a commentary about it. Let's pick Prey, from 2017. I really enjoyed the game, the atmosphere, the mechanics and the little secrets that I've found. After that, I've watched some really in-depth reviews that talked mostly about the shortcomings of the game, showing me a lot of stuff that didn't bother me that much when I first played it.  \nAfter trying to play it again, I couldn't ignore said shortcomings, and the overall experience was a lot worse than when I went blind - By watching overanalysed criticism about the game, I discovered shortcomings that I'd probably never find out by myself - Did that help me in any way?  \n\nSame goes for Dark Souls - I remember really digging the entire game - (aside from Bed of Chaos and the Archers of Anor Londo), but after watching some commentaries about the game, I've \"\"\"\"discovered\"\"\"\" that Lost Izalith is a badly designed area, that the last half of the game isn't as good as the first half, and so on, and so on - Problems that I didn't find on the first (or second, or third, and so on) time that I've replayed the game, but now I can't ignore it.  \n\nOf course, as I've said before, sometimes overanalysing something can be good - You'll get an in-depth complete view of the product, and you'll know exactly what you got. You can also find a lot more appreciation from certain aspects of that game, discovering interesting secrets, or just finding out stuff that passed by the first time you played it.  \nBut the problem remain: Is \"opening the eyes of other players\" always a good thing? Is overreviewing/overanalysing games a healthy practice for the future of gaming? Do you still enjoy games as much as you do after watching or reading complete reviews of it?\n\nThanks for reading - I'd really appreciate if you could share your opinion on this topic. ",

So it's the same song and dance of my youth, amusingly enough.\n\nBut it leads me to wonder, how many games do you need to own to make it worth it to buy a console? To use a recent example, are you fine with buying a console for ONE game like the Switch for Super Mario Odyssey? Do you need 10 games? 20? 50? I think emulation has kind of warped my concept of how large a collection \"should\" be over the years, because part of me feels like a collection of 10 games is far too small, especially when a lot of these older games can be expensive.

I really enjoy Hearthstone, Gwent, Faeria, and many other online card games - yet, I find myself craving for a single-player cardgame experience made with care, and interesting mechanics.\n\nWe have some examples of SPCG (Single Player Card Games) - As I've said in the title, Hand of Fate is one of the greatest. On the original PSX, we had Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, that can also be called an \"original card game\" because it follows none of the rules from the tabletop version - And to this day, it's one of the most addicting card games that I've ever played, only limited by the limitations of the PSX, and not having that many cards.  \nForbidden Memories also tried to create a narrative in a card game - something that I didn't see before at the time, but the game was flawed in many ways - Most enemies in the game were incredible hard, forcing you to grind in the \"Free Duel\" menu for hours and hours - it was still fun, and I think that things like this can work if the mechanics are fun and well implemented.  \n\nWith the recent popularity of certain games like Hearthstone and others, I really wish we had more people in the industry focused in original card games with good narratives and or/interesting gaming mechanics aggregated to the card mechanics - just like Hand of Fate tried to do.  \n\nWith enough time, I'm sure that one day a good original card-game will come to make the wish of card-gaming addicts come true, but until then, I give you a question:\nFor you, what would make a single-player card game unique and interesting?\n",

In the comments, most people talked about watching let's play videos to see gameplay... Which really got me curious\n\nI personally like to do a YouTube search for \"(game name) review\" instead of \"(game name) gameplay\". Don't get me wrong, I enjoy let's play's, but they are flawed in some ways\n\nWith let's play's, you're either going to see gameplay from the start of the game, which is a poor representation of the rest of the game, in many cases, you're going to see gameplay from the middle/end of the game, which may contain spoilers, or you're going to see 'highlights', where the YouTuber cuts together some of the best moments from the game into a single compilation. These generally paint the game in either an overly good way, or highlights most of the game's flaws... Generally whatever's more funny\n\nLet's play'ers care more about getting themselves views than painting a fair picture of the game. Which is fair enough. If you enjoy watching their videos, you might watch more of them, which is ultimately your goal, thus they may leave out a lot of unentertaining parts of the gameplay, unless their commentary can somehow make it entertaining\n\nOnto reviews: watching a review (hopefully) gets you someone's honest opinion about the game. Reviews will generally cover several topics, from gameplay to story to graphics, plus anything else that makes the game noteworthy. It should also do it in a way as to not spoil the story, which is something that can not be said about many let's play's\n\nWith reviews, you do run the risk of the reviewer being payed to be very generous in his review, but the same can be said about let's play's. Also, this only seems to be a problem with big reviewers (IGN). \n\nLuckily there are many smaller review channels. This is another reason I started this thread... Many times, of you search for a review, some of the most watched videos might only have a few thousand views. That's not even saying they're bad: in my experiences, these videos still have decent editing etc.\n\nDo people just not like reviews anymore? Generally speaking, a videos top \"let's play\" will have much more views than it's top review, where reviews try to be more fair and sometimes have better editing\n\nThen, of course, there's Steam's user reviews. These can be pretty reliable, but you'll see many people upvote it for \"joke\" reviews, and many people downvote it due to small issues. Still, pretty reliable, if you don't mind reading through a bunch of them\n\nFinally, trailers... Almost completely useless, apart from maybe getting you a feel for the game's world and story",

I was watching the matches from last night, awed by the skill on each team. The strategies used to funnel the other players or the crazy solo plays that would lead to a point taken or a map won. \n\nAnd it struck it me, the people who were throwing shade on eSports and competitions follow the Patriots Facebook page do so because **they understand how skilled that team is**. Those people have thrown or caught a football, run the length of a field, and they understand that what those athletes are doing is not a normal feat. Same with any other traditional sport, they have a baseline of how the game is played and then can recognize that Stephen Curry or Joey Votto are competing beyond the backyard 5-a-side.\n\nWhen those same spectators look at eSports, they just see \"kids playing video games\". They don't recognize map awareness, team strategy, and target tracking. Players of Overwatch, CSGO, LoL, Starcraft and CoD get hyped up when someone goes on a tear, because we've tried that and sometimes we've made it but a lot of times we were shut down. Just like a sports fan has heaved a ball as hard as they could, only for it to go a fraction of what the pro accomplished. \n\nBut how could we convey those concepts of difficulty without coming off as condescending? I remember a few comparison shows like 'Pros vs Joes' on Spike and 'Shaq Vs' on ABC that helped showcase the talent but I don't think it would transfer well to games. \n\nThank you for reading, if you think I'm incorrect with my conclusion or if you have any ideas on how we could bridge that gap, please let me know.",

Have games, from having to show us something during  loading times, actually invented design elements that enrich the gameplay experience?\n\nSo my question is, do we want the loading screen to stay? \n\nHere's some of the different loading screens that I can remember(and that Ive enjoyed)  :\n\nBayonetta - Practice combos. Playing this on the Ps3, the long loading times were perfect for trying out new moves in a safe environment. I don't see how they could have picked a better screen for this type of game that benefits from combo memorization. \n\nDark Souls - Read random item descriptions. It's kind of basic. Nothing too fancy. You might not read the descriptions of items on your own, if the game didn't view them while waiting. But there might be another reason why I like these screens that I'll get to next. \n\nCan the loading screens be a tool of pacing? After some gameplay it might be nice to put down the controller for a moment. If this is the case and we were to get rid of the loading screens, do you think there would be a good way to pace a game like this? Are elevators actually loading screens? They might be better in some cases than displaying an immersion breaking screen. \n\nAnd as a bonus question, what loading screens  have you enjoyed the most? ",

Today I'd like to discuss a timeless classic, or that's what people often say when they're about to discuss Planescape: Torment. \n\nPS:T (I'll be refering Planescape: Torment as PS:T in this thread!) is still one of the most talked games when you discuss cRPG', or any kind of RPG. Look at any \"best RPG's ever\" list, and you'll probably see PS:T in the top 5 - at this point, the game has pretty much achieved legendary status among gaming and non-gaming fans alike.\n\nMy first experience with PS:T was when I was 17 (I'm 23 now). I finished the game, and I loved the entire cast (props to Morte, Dak'kon, Fall-from-Grace, and Vhailor - I love them all!), and the plot really intrigued me - yet I didn't enjoy the game as much as I think I did. Maybe I was forcing myself to like **every** part of it, instead of being more critical - at least, at the time.\n\nWith the recent launch of [Planescape: Torment - Enhanced Edition](http://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/),\n I decided to give it a replay. I'll not be judging the enhancements, because I played the original game in it's original state, and most things are still the same, so this discussion is about PS:T in general. After putting some good hours on it...\n\nI'm surprised of how much I like this game. Maybe time made my tastes get a bit better (or worse, who knows!), but I find myself enjoying PS:T a lot more than I first did, when I was 17. I'm taking more time to read everything, I'm not using any kind of walkthrough, and even the shortcomings of this game, like the super basic combat, or the (lack of) explanation of the RPG mechanics for those who aren't into D&amp;D rules don't bother me as much as they did the first time I played the game.\n\nYet, even after playing PS:T, I still can't get into Baldur's Gate or Icewind: Dale, which are also classics of the cRPG genre. Some of my friends who also like PS:T also share this opinion.\n\nWith all that in mind, I ask you the same question as the title of this thread: If you played PS:T: did you have a good time? Why the same can't be said about some of the other classics? \n\nThanks!",

Well we're back again with a new rules list that should hopefully fix some of the issues you guys had with the current rules revisions. The hot topic of the last post was on list posts and it seems the resounding opinion from everybody is that they should not only stay banned, but the hammer should be brought down upon them much more heavily. \n\nAdditionally, the format of the rules has been changed (thanks to /u/aanzeijar for the idea, and thanks in advance for letting us rip it so blatantly!!), with four different sections. The \"General Guidelines\" is currently a bit of a catch-all and disorganized. Not all of those things are easy to moderate so some of them aren't even rules. If you have any ideas on how to split it up, please chime in!\n\nAnyhow, here's V2 of the proposed rule revisions: \n\n**This is a subreddit for quality discussion about gaming**  \n•\tAll discussion must be about gaming  \n•\tBlatant circlejerks, memes, and image links will be removed  \n•\tList posts will be removed   \n•\tGaming, not purchasing games or suggesting what game to play next     \n\n**Focus your discussion**  \n•\tMatch the title and topic of the submission  \n•\tIf posting a link, also include your own thoughts on the discussion  \n•\tAdditionally, submissions without a body will be removed  \n\n**General Guidelines**  \n•\tDiscussion about specific games and features is encouraged  \n•\tWe discourage echo chambers, try playing the devil’s advocate when there’s no dissenting opinion  \n•\tBe civil   \n•\tIf you don’t agree with somebody else, try to understand their viewpoint before replying  \n•\tUpvote well thought out posts, even if you do not agree  \n•\tDownvote posts that do not contribute to the discussion or are low effort  \n•\tDo not downvote because you disagree  \n•\tReport rule violations when you see them  \n•\tBots are discouraged, report unhelpful bots when you see them  \n\n**Additionally, these types of posts must have prior consent of the moderators prior to posting:**  \n•\tGiveaways  \n•\tSurveys/Studies  \n•\tDonations  \n•\tIf you aren’t sure about a post, ask!  \n\nAs with last time, please reply with your own thoughts and what you think should be either amended/changed or added/removed. Also this new set of rules won't go in until you guys are satisfied.   \n\nThanks for being such awesome people, without you guys this subreddit wouldn't be possible!\n",

        "author": "69Milfs",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7ps5vo/are_open_world_games_bloated/",
        "text": "It feels like to me, many open world games are just too damn \"bloated\"--there's too much repetition and a lack of meaningful nuance to the various areas of the map. [Here's probably one of the worst offenders](https://i.imgur.com/W5ZsBDf.png)(Assassin's Creed: Unity). \n\nI got Assassin's Creed: Origins and while I found it to definitely be a step up from previous titles, it still suffered from a mild case of the Ubisoft plague. There are still a few repetitive side quests and an over-reliance on \"clear out this bandit camp and kill the bandit leader or retrieve this object...after clearing out the bandit camp and killing the bandit leader\" \n\nThe Witcher III also honestly felt bloated to me at times. I haven't played any of the DLCs, so I'm basing this all off on the main game. I actually love that the world was so big because it added a real sense of scale, improved the overall gameplay flow, and allowed for reflection. While I do understand that side quests and \"activities\" are optional, I soon got downright tired of them and ended up steaming through the main quest halfway through my playthrough and ignoring almost everything else (although I Googled around for the \"best\" side quests to do). I began dreading seeing ? on my map. \n\nLong story short, many of the side stuff just got too repetitive. **I would have preferred more \"quality\"/uniqueness, and less quantity.** While the game sure as hell isn't anywhere near as big as an offender as Ubisoft: The Game, I still would have preferred if CDPR condensed the amount of side quests and instead focused on longer, more distinct, and more involved missions. For every Bloody Barron, there are like three \"MMO-style\" quests: walk from A to B and kill/get X (and not much of a veneer to disguise this). While the side quests are in TW3 are definitely better than almost all other open world games, it eventually gets to the point where CDPR's writing can't disguise the sameyness that creeps up (I also don't think that their writing is that good tbh because the bar in general for vide games is quite low). Oh, and the \"detective mode\"/Witcher sense thing got super old fucking fast. \n\nOne can destroy oh so many monster nests or fight for protected treasures before the act either starts to be committed out of duty or sidelined altogether. I would have preferred if they sharply reduced the monster nests and instead made them more \"unique\" i.e. each nest has a \"gimmick\" like environmental hazards, less repetition in terms of monster nest types, marauding bandits interfering, a mini-boss who shows up out of nowhere, discovering that the nest was actually created by a human, etc. \n\nAnother offender is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While the actual game doesn't feel \"bloated\" (besides the ridiculous Korok seeds), it suffers from a different problem. Essentially, the player doesn't really experience anything fundamentally new or different past the first 10 or so hours, after they defeat their first Divine Beast. There are a negligible amount of gameplay mechanics or new enemies that the player encounters, assuming that they took a bit of time to explore the world. Furthermore, the actual maps is sorely lacking in interesting and unique landmarks for a game of this size, such as fortresses, caves, smaller settlements, enterable ruins, etc. Long story short, the game doesn't feel like it changes much and loses any real sense of novelty very early. \n\nOut of recent releases, I would consider Horizon Zero Dawn to be a good example of how to deal with an open world. While many activities are repeated, such as clearing Cauldrons, climbing Tallnecks to reveal the map (similar to Assassin's Creed vantage points), etc, the actual amount of them is tastefully low (but not too low) so that you never get a sense of repetition. Even when they are repeated, they are unique enough so that every time you do the same activity, it feels quite different. For example, one Tallneck is in the middle of a bandit camp and another is in a canyon surrounded by flying enemies who you have to defeat or else they'll knock you down as you climb. Furthermore, as the game goes along, it consistently introduces new enemies so that even core gameplay always feels fresh as you adapt to the new creatures and switch up your tactics. \n\nAnother would be Yakuza 0, in terms of how it handled side quests. But I only got about 1/3 through. Fallout: New Vegas is probably one of my favorites of all time. ",

The concept we're working with is, in spirit, a bit like Telltale Games' format (with some focus on elements as you'd find in Knight of the Old Republic/Mass Effect/Etc), but attempting to utilize inventory and interaction with characters so that decisions [not timed] are one-off -- meaning that if you decide to do or say X or Y while interacting with a character/item/etc that that decision stays with you. We want it to be challenging, accessible, and, well -- FUN.\n\nWe're a small team of creatives -- just working on this on the side for giggles and such -- as such we do have limitations -- but that also means that we're not committed to a tight deadline or influence from anyone besides ourselves. All of us have experience professionally in the video game industry -- love to read -- love sci-fi/fantasy/weirdness -- and are motivated by the act of creation over financial success (but, hey!

        "text": "I can't get into MMORPG. I feel part of that issue stems from the way my friends and family inevitably try to introduce me to these games. \n\nThese people have usually already spent their time getting into the game and experiencing all the content new and fresh. Spent hours learning the lore and finding their way in the world. Memorizing raids and figuring out the next piece of end game gear they will grind for. They have all the answers and a desire to let me see the great stuff at the end of the road. \n\nSo when I load up my fresh character I'm told to rush the starting zone. Meet them somewhere and then they proceed to tell me exactly which quests to pick up and then where to stand while they wipe every low level monster in sight to power level me. That leaves me feeling rather useless and basically side steps the whole point of having a huge world filled with things to explore and challenges to overcome. I'm denied the whole reason I would have enjoyed the game to begin with. \n\nSo I try to go alone. I solo my way through a few quests on my own and my friends now are off doing end game content without me. Sort of denying them the whole point of trying to bring me into the game, which was to socialize and have fun with the group. \n\nSo we're stuck in a position where it will take too long to have fun with my friends but wont let me take the time to grow with the game properly and learn to like it. Level skips don't seem to be a good fix to this problem. It seems to confirm that early content isn't worth experiencing anyway and now I'm high level with none of the experiences to go with it. \n\nIs there a good solution out there to bringing new players into a world and not having the power difference ruin the experience for both players?",

        "text": "Now first off, i am not against save scumming in certain games(aka in games such as as civilization, xcom, and other pure mechanical games, such as rpgs) i oppose it as a narrative breaker, IMO so here's my argument...\nWhen i (usually) mind you, play telltale style games (until dawn,the wolf among us, the walking dead oxen free) i usually put myself in the shoes  of the character, and ask, What would i do? Tbh i usually don’t save scum in these kinds of games, because narratively, it makes choice illusional and pretty pointless, When you can just go “No, i like this character, i do not want her to die, i'll go back and time and resurrect her/him” it makes the player caused death pointless and unnecessary. TO me when it comes to choice, it only matters when it it “Permanent” as in non reversible, otherwise getting to chose the other option later makes  the first option pointless therefore making the choice meaningless in the first place. Because in real life, you can't have your cake and eat it too, same goes for narrative driven games, it gives the player certain omnipotence they do not have in games…… But you say, What about games where save scumming is allowed Ie zero escape? Well that's a tricky subject….. In the third game of the series Zero time dilemma , the choices and paths you take are all chopped up and played out of order in certain short scenarios you randomly pick  due to the games floating fragment system …. This means that the plot is non existence or rather, left up to a random number generator, for instance the “Timeline” or path your currently playing in can change randomly introducing elements that WILL come out of nowhere(IE the ) for example. If i choose one thing, and that results in a death of a character,  the fragment ends…. 1 i could replay the fragment and choose differently, resulting in everybody loves, but it doesn't matter because in the context of the game, the characters are mindwiped every time a fragment ends, making me do 2 choose another fragment, where set entirely on another timeline where another character died so on and so forth, no matter what decision you make, it's going to be entirely avoided and stuff like that. That's why i think save scumming in narrative based games breaks the story. It ruins choice and consequence introduced in it making it inconequestial to the story ahead…. Thoughts?\n(https://youtu.be/-YrDdsak_ Adam Carter-Groves  did a talk about this in more indeph at the videobrains even in 2015)",

        "text": "This might lead to reactionary downvotes, so I just wanted to point out that I'm in no way bashing Nintendo or anybody who enjoys their products.\n\nI got this thing as a Christmas present, so I feel guilty having this contemplation, but there are a few things stopping me from enjoying this console.\n\nFor starters it's expensive, for the price of this console I could have upgraded my PS4 to a PS4 pro, and sold my original PS4 for even more money. Or I could have bought PlayStation VR. Hell, I'm sure there are some budget gaming computers you could build at that price.\n\nThe quality doesn't match it's price, in my opinion. Each game is like £50, including, IIRC, Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle. I don't know if I'm willing to save up that much money just to buy Nintendo games, which - no offence - mostly feel like indie titles. I started having second thoughts once I realised I just simply didn't like Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle as much as I thought I would. Initially I wanted Mario Odyssey but it ended up being sold out rather quickly during December.\n\nThe game was okay, I wasn't motivated to try and 100% it though at all. If you're going to troll your players at every chapter with trial and error mechanics, it needs to have an engaging enough reason to push through. I had this problem with Crash Bandicoot 'N Sane Trilogy. Sure they're a challenge, but they're just a challenge for the sake of being a challenge, games like this are probably better with friends. Like I can imagine daring a friend while to try and complete the High Road just for a laugh.\n\nBut I digress. There are games I did focus on getting for the Nintendo Switch, including Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Puyo Puyo Tetris and Super Bomberman R. But at second glance, I've played more Tetris games than I care to remember, and I've only played one Bomberman that actually had an engaging story and level design. I think it was Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo?\n\nZelda: Breath of the Wild has supposedly been emulated and is now playable on the PC - due to it also being ported to the Wii U - and I don't want a whole console if it's just going to be a Super Mario Odyssey box.\n\nMoving past al that, the first thing I didn't like was the eShop, it's way too simplified and is already becoming as convoluted as Steam, with games that are so bad they're being sold for only a few pounds.\n\nMaybe this game just disappointed me, but I just feel like I'm better off focusing on one system, which is my PS4. Is there anything else I'm forgetting about? Apart from two games I feel there's nothing special about the Nintendo Switch, and I care very little for the portability of it.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the input guys, I'll definitely be pondering these points. A lot of you are very well spoken and it inspires me to try and improve my writing ability. \n\nInitially I was just disappeared because I thought I typed all that trying to word it perfectly just for it to be downvoted and basically censored - making it a waste of time to bother. I'm just weary, but I'm open to all takes on this if anybody else sees this thread. ",

        "text": "I'm just finishing up watching Game Grumps play through the game and as a spectator, I was really surprised by how good the game looked. The presentation is great, but the actual game looks cohesive and seems like it would be a ton of fun to play. The gameplay doesn't look incredibly deep or difficult, but the more I watch them play the game, the more I want to play it. I don't think it could really compete with the other platformers that came out this year, but it definitely looks like a step up from your typical 3D Sonic fare. \n\nJust watching the characters zip around the screen and seeing these huge set pieces was breathtaking, even if it was mostly spectacle. Each level hits you with something new and beautiful to look at. And the soundtrack is so delightfully cheerful, I feel like I might find myself listening to it on my own time. Call me crazy, but I feel like \"butt rock\" has its place in Sonic games and just adds to the childish atmosphere at this point.\n\nI really love the idea of the OC character. I was never really into Sonic, but I could see how someone who's a fan of the story, especially kids or older fans who grew up with the 3D Sonic games, would really love their own character in a Sonic game. And in a really wholesome (albeit kind of corny) way, a lot of the dialogue is focused on making the OC character feel welcome in the world, with sugary sweet moments where Sonic spouts off about the power of friendship and how the two of you are absolutely unstoppable together.\n\nAgain, I didn't *play* any of this game. I just watched it, but from what I've seen, it looks like one of the \"better\" Sonic games. I get the feeling that people will warm up to it in the following years, when it's more likely to go on sale and people lower their expectations. I feel like I can already see posts online a year from now saying: \"Just finished Sonic Forces. What's with all the hate this game got?\" \n\nBut I want to know what other people think of this game. Reviews suggest the game is mediocre, but I feel like if you're a fan of 3D Sonic, they're probably irrelevant to you anyway. How did you feel about the level design and moment-to-moment gameplay? Did you feel like the OC and character customization enhanced the experience for you? Is the game exactly what 3D Sonic should be or way off?\n\nThanks for reading. :)\n\n",

        "text": "Ok, so a few things. Im pooping, and im at a [6} right now, so I'm gonna do my best to keep this post oriented and on point.\n\nIn the Title, by \"Episodic Realism,\" (a term I totally made up right now), i mean gameplay that has faults, but clicks more often then not, resulting in very realistic movement and believable environments. In essence, gameplay moments that are NOT scripted, but blur the line between user control and cutscene.\n\nTo get on with it a bit, I think games like Grand Theft Auto: 4, Backbreaker, Call of Duty 4, and Battlefield: Bad Company are the future of gaming. The first two games use an engine and technique called Euphoria (Naturalmotion?) to create naturally occurring reactions in characters. Most notably, this is why characters in GTA4 would try to grab for railings while tumbling pathetically down stairs when bumped into [example here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L79QWmn9df4). \n\nThe big issue with this engine is that it looks straight up goofy at times, as observed in the video. But what is also important to note is how often it looks realistic. How immersive it was to be on the run from the cops, hop out of your burning wasted vehicle, run across lanes of traffic only to be sideswiped by a panicking civilian, and watch your character grab for balance, miss, and smash his face into the pavement, pulpy-like. Add in Red Dead Redemption for the same reasons.\n\nOr in the underperforming and underwhelming football game Backbreaker, seeing a wide receiver make a cut, and get hit in the center of gravity is a beautiful thing. The players react very realistically, gut-wrenchingly so at times, to these hits. But then the goofiness sets in and it looks amateurish. [big hit examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01ZyYewCAH4).\n\nI used both examples to show how critically acclaimed and mediocre games alike have utilized the technology in its current state.\n\naside from this tech, look at the two bigger hitting games from the two big war franchises: cod4 and battlefield bad company. In call of duty, the online was balanced and set up perfectly to allow moments of utter chaos, reflecting the nature of war. in the battlefield games, you have all aspects of war merging in destructive environments, creating more of that hectic chaotic gameplay,\n\nI think where I was going with this was euphoria needs work, but I think that will be the future of mcharacter motion in gaming.(**) and I think games will be more focused on creating for the player those small moments, or episodes, of total immersion, and perfect gameplay. this is interspersed with moments of the technology being clearly a little off. (**)\n\nI think they will focus on these small moments rather than total immersion and perfect gameplay throughout because that is when the turing wall begins to get breached.\n\n(**)OMG you guys i think that was my original point in between the asterisks above. sorry I rambled.(**)",

        "text": "When I was younger, and therefore had less access to multiple games (say Christmas and birthday presents exclusively), I always finished games that I started. Beyond simply getting to the end, I also typically completed most or all side quests/optional content. I imagine this had a lot to do with not having anything else to play. Now that I'm a full-fledged adult and can (and do) purchase any game I'm interested in, I'm sitting on a few hundred Steam games, and a dozen or more PS4 and Xbox titles that I haven't gotten around to even starting.\n\nNow not having enough time to start games isn't that unusual; I have significantly less free time now than I did when I was in school, as well as other responsibilities, but of the games I start I finish maybe 10% of them. The last game I remember getting to the end of (not even 100%) was Fallout New Vegas.\n\nIn the past 2-3 years I have started, really enjoyed, and then not finished: Borderlands 2, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Stacking, Burnout Paradise, Halo 3/ODST/CE Anniversary, Lego Star Wars Complete Saga, Uncharted 4, Far Cry 4, Fable 3, and Arkham Knight. And those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head. For each of them I'd say I got anywhere from 50-80% of the way through the entire story line before stopping.  I certainly put enough hours into the above games to feel as though I got my money's worth, but not seeing the end of those stories sometimes nags at the back of my mind.\n\n**So here's the question:** am I alone in this, or do you also habitually leave games unfinished? And in either case, do you feel that the experience of a game is significantly diminished by not reaching the end? In that vein, if you do this, or have friends that do, why do you think it happens? It it just an embarrassment of available gaming riches, or is it boredom, or something else? Do you think game length is a factor?\n\nI'd love to hear thoughts from all of you on this, as few of my friends are as heavily into gaming as I am.",

Obviously this isn't entirely realistic, but I refer to it from a different perspective: without this \"video game\" feedback, you wouldn't know your character's weak or dying from their needs.\n\nSure, reaching sorry states of character maintenance would certainly cause loss of strength, dexterity, eventually vitality, but never is it conveyed that the character is actually *hurting* for relief, beyond a bark, and thus the players never get to better understand the desperation, the despair of being close to death.\n\nAs it stands, you could just as easily leave your character standing still until he gives in to his needs, or let him run around doing errands until he falls to the same fate, and except for *how well* he can do something, it never changes the fact that he can *almost always* do the same things when healthy as when almost crumbling over.\n\nI'm not saying this from the perspective of a life-or-death situation survivor at all, but even being a little hungry or thirsty makes a person quickly think about satisfying their needs. Could a survival game make use of this, and \"take away\" control of the character, to emphasise immersion? Would an alternative be better, like extra screen effects, plain denying abilities past certain thresholds, or even very slow health loss at any Need stage beyond \"Slightly Hungry/Thirsty/so on\" that grows faster the worse off you are, and also recovers just as slowly?",

I was so fucking pissed because not only did my selection of The Turks have nothing to do with being pro-Turkish but also because the Americans were my second favorite faction in the game.\n\nIn a similar note, when Call of Duty 4 was still big a few grudges even started against me on the internet because I preferred to use some of the Russian classes instead of the Allied. People thought I was pro-communist (which really hurt me because I was so pro-capitalist).  I even switched to a specific French class and still people were bashing me for not being \"pro-American\"  even though my selection was primarily based on gameplay mechanics (especially weapons the class had).\n\nI am curious have any of you ever experienced this?? \n\nEDITED\n\nI even used the Americans in Empire Total War because they're quite well balanced compared to other factions. And guess what some Southern guy started calling me anti-Confederate because I prefer using the \"Yankees\". Uhhh this game takes place in an era before the Confederacy ever existed! Even choosing your own faction can get you bashed simply because you don't choose a specific microdivision (the game may not even allow choosing say Frederick Barbarossa's army and only allows you to choose the Templars or the Hospitalers).",

        "text": "I bought GTA V recently. I have great memories of playing San Andreas and Vice City with my brother in my pre-teen days, and since GTA V is one of the most acclaimed and fastest selling games of all time I had high hopes going in. I was utterly disappointed.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's an incredible technical achievement. The game looks nice even on console and the world is enormous. This is about the only positive thing I have to say about the game.\n\nThe world is enormous, but as with most games that can boast this, **most of it is irrelevant to the game**. This is not a con in and of itself but I can't help but feel that open world games use ever-larger worlds as a crutch to avoid innovating substantively better experiences. Even if your world is big, even if it's detailed, what impetus is there to explore it? The onus is on the game developer to expose the player to the world through the gameplay experience. I found nothing about the actual experience of GTA V particularly satisfying.\n\nMost of the game is spent driving. The \"feel\" of driving is decent in this game, but not exceptional (this is highly subjective, granted). Most of the time one spends driving they will find themselves unable to actually take in the world the player inhabits: you are on your way to some objective, and so you are constantly checking the minimap to make sure you are on track, or you are attentively scanning for upcoming obstacles so you don't crash into them. The driving gameplay makes the game's own crowning achievement, its huge and detailed world, hard to appreciate.\n\nThe game has three main characters: Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. Michael and especially Trevor are terribly written; I could easily be convinced that they were written by 13 year olds that Rockstar directed to create \"edgy\" characters. Their voice acting is no better. Michael's portrayal is grating, unconvincing, and flat. Trevor's is outright cringe-inducing and completely one-dimensional. Watching cutscenes involving these characters is an actively unpleasant experience.\n\nThe whole experience struck me as incredibly shallow. You dutifully head towards the objective marker (one eye glued to the minimap), shoot some things, and repeat. The reasons quickly became a mystery to me because subjecting myself to the characters and their portrayal was a chore. I ended up putting the game down without completing it.\n\nAm I the only one who felt this way? I've found myself totally bewildered by the acclaim this game has received; it's been hailed as one of the best ever. Why?\n\nAlso, recommendations for good games would be appreciated. My tastes can vary; in the past few years I've enjoyed TLoU, Mario Odyssey, Titan Souls, Okami HD, and Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. My favorite series of all time are Zelda (I had mixed feelings about BotW, found it kind of weak; going into that would be it's own post) and Hitman.",

        "text": "Games-as-\"services\" are the new Big Kahunas for the games industry. Focusing mainly on online/multiplayer components whilst drip feeding content and patches over multiple years, these games are hailed by industry analysts as \"the future of gaming\" and are seemingly being pursued and hungrily desired by damn near every big publisher in the industry.\n\nWhy are they the future? Because they’re seemingly easier to sell. And many are selling huge numbers, whilst still retaining a large proportion of the audience. Overwatch and PUBG are prime examples of GAS done right on the business side of things. Overwatch has garnered in excess of 30 million players, whilst PUBG has sold over 25 million units across Xbox One and PC, with a record shattering 3 million peak concurrent players on Steam.\n\n\nWhy do publishers love the prospect of them? It sounds cynical, jaded and slightly pretentious (it's not), but it's because of the idea of what they call, \"uncapped monetisation\". These GAS allow for the minimisation of investment, and the maximisation of monetisation. Gamers are playing the game constantly, so there's an opportunity to create what Strauss Zelnick calls \"recurrent consumer spending\" through constant exposure to in-game storefronts. \n\n\nIt's proven to be a lucrative model for a decent number of games. Namely, Overwatch, GTAO, PUBG and a few others. The problem is that it might not be as lucrative for very much longer. Here's why.\n\n\n**Time and Variety:**  \nThey say time is money. And like money, people only have so much time. A GAS is generally designed around making the player spend a lot of time and hopefully a lot of money on it, and it alone. You can see how this idea contradicts the notion of most of the industry trying to dive head first into this model. If everyone and their dog are putting together a PUBG/Overwatch/GTAO/Destiny rip-off, how do players divide their purchases and time between so many games with the same ultimate function? This is before thinking about the precedence effect, as in “people who want to play PUBG are going to play PUBG as opposed to PUBG-Lite V.23”.  Fortnite is an exception to this rule, but it was able to fill the F2P spot for PUBG before anyone else. If you want examples for what I’m talking about, just look at Law Breakers. It’s an arena hero shooter that came out after Overwatch, and has been written off as a 32 million USD loss for the publisher. \n\n\n**Quality Control**:  \nA few months ago, a NPD analyst basically stated that in order to sell, single player games had to be good. You may be wondering why I use the acronym GAS instead of the standard GAAS. Well, in part, it’s because I think that acronym perfectly embodies what GAS are intended to be. Unsubstantial, intangible fluff, that only rises because of how light it truly is (not all GAAS, of course).\n\n Unless you’re COD, most game franchises can’t survive on mediocrity forever. I don’t think it’s unfair to say that PUBG is really only popular because of the battle royale novelty, and the twitch streamers. With Bluhole planning for PUBG to be a “global multimedia phenomenon” complete with a Netflix show/movie, cartoons, comic books and other unwarranted nonsense that novelty may wear thin. \n\n\nThis goes treble for the studios and publishers pursuing this sect of the market with impunity, simply because they think there’s money to make.  \nSquare Enix’s CEO said a few months back that single player games have been superseded by multiplayer games, and that Square Enix as a whole is interested in getting into the fray. A lot of people panicked and now assume Square is going to abandon single player stuff, but I personally wasn’t worried. I’m even less concerned now.\n\n\nHere’s what’s going to happen: They’re gonna release Dissidia NT hoping it to be a lead into e-sports. That won’t happen because that game is probably going to be mediocre at best, and won’t compete in terms of design. They’ll then release Tabata’s online IP, which will not be worth much. Their single player stuff will keep raising their profits. Why do I think this? Because Square Enix’s studios are not geared for a focus on an online functionality. When they tried to do it with the Sleeping Dogs sequel, the studio was shut down. \nQuality is now something that publishers and studios can get away with as long as their game can be played online with friends for hours on end, but as the hits keep coming, consumers might start to wake up and smell the coffee. \n\nIt’s difficult to deny that a lot of the games that have had microtransactions recently have been mediocre to straight up bad. Shadow of War is an inferior game to its predecessor and Destiny 2 is about as bad and bland as you can get. Jason Schreier recently said on a podcast that Bungie rebooted development in 2016, and  proposed the Eververse to Activision because they thought it would be easier to sell drip feed frivolous content as opposed to making good, and plentiful content. After making serious bank on Destiny 1, itself a half-baked game in its shell form.\n\n\nI’ll go out on a limb, and say that RDR2 is probably going to be Rockstar’s Fallout 4. Zelnick’s made it clear what he wants, and with the success of GTAO and the immediate prominence of online talk in the marketing, I don’t think RD2 will be the masterpiece people expect.\n\n\n**Riding the wave as the rot sets in**:  \nAdmittedly, I’m kind of aping Jim Sterling here, but the point still stands. Yes, microtransactions, GAS and online multiplayer are popular, but for how long? The online controversy about this stuff is not slowing down, and the stigma continues to grow.\n\n\nShawn Layden took a quick swipe at GAS at PSX, as did a few other devs and presenters. Zachary Levi called out microtransactions and was met with thunderous laughs at the Game Awards. Square’s CEO even recently took microtransactions in console/PC games to task, saying that they don’t fit in with the psychology as they do with mobile stuff. \n\n\nThey want to retain players still, but I have a feeling that will become less important to them with ample time. Keep in mind that this is the company that released the failed Deus Ex MD, which occurred in part because of the non-intrusive, but obnoxiously shoehorned microtransactions. They’ve hopefully learned that lesson to an extent, but there’s more to learn.\n\n\nThe performance EA gave that has incited the threat of global government intervention, the increasing stigma against loot boxes, and consumers eventually waking up and smelling the coffee will probably result in a lot of publishers backing off the idea, as they did with motion controls, 3D television and to an extent, VR. I expect Square to be the first to join that line, simply because the bubble will not be difficult to pop. \nIn mobile gaming 48% of all revenue came from 0.19% of users.  \nhttps://venturebeat.com/2016/03/23/half-of-all-mobile-games-revenue-comes-from-only-0-19-of-players-report/\n\nI can only imagine it’s similar or even less for console games. The industry is trying to go all in on a small subsect of people, and when they get fed up, that’s upwards of half of your precious recurrent revenue streams gone. Probably more like upwards of 90%, because if the easily manipulated get fed up of it, the remainder of the audience would have completely written it off way before that.\n\n\nAnd they will get fed up. I’m sure everyone here is aware of Activision’s microtransaction engine patent that will alter matchmaking to psychologically manipulate players into purchasing weapons and gear. EA is gearing up to release Anthem, a Destiny rip-off that will without a doubt incorporate some sort of RNG, gameplay affecting loot system. Yes in fact, I believe that publishers will probably try to make as much money as possible before the stigma starts to hit, and/or before government intervention does. I expect Anthem to be the culmination of this entire fiasco and a footnote marking its end. Bold, yes, but I’ll stand by it for now.\n\nWhat really seals the deal for me is this golden quote from Strauss Zelnick in early 2017, the year after Take-Two made multiple hundreds of millions in revenue(and in profit, margins described by ex-Rockstar president Leslie Benzies as close to 100%) just from Shark Cards alone, not counting the millions of GTA copies still not far from full price in the same year.  \nhttps://www.destructoid.com/gta-v-publisher-we-can-do-more-microtransactions-with-our-under-monetized-users-439163.phtml  \n&gt; \"You can't give stuff away for free in perpetuity; there's no business model in that,\" said Zelnick, \n&gt; \"We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetising on a per-user basis,\" he continued, \"There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers.\"  \n&gt; \"We're not going to grab the last nickel.\"\n\nGTAO revenues: https://segmentnext.com/2016/10/05/gta-online-revenue-exceeded-700-million/  \n\nThis coming from the company that is making GTAO increasingly Pay-2-Win/Pay-2-Progress, to further increase their heaps of pure profit.  \nTo me, this signifies an industry that is not going to pushing, until the tree completely collapses. Despite attracting the threat of government intervention, EA's top execs still claim they are staunch in the pursuit of advancing in the microtransactions space.\n\nhttp://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-11-28-you-probably-dont-want-darth-vader-in-pink  \n&gt; \"We're not giving up on the notion of MTX,\" Jorgensen said. \"We're learning and listening to the community in terms of how best to roll that out in the future, and there's more to come as we learn more. But I would say we're certainly not changing our strategy.\n\nYou still have a subsect of people claiming that this stuff is getting peddled because \"Games are too expensive to make\", but we know that that is not the case. \nEA spent a grand total of about 94 million USD on Deadspace 2, sold from 4 million copies sold, and still made a profit of approximately 26 million if the numbers in this article are correct:  \nhttp://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/18/ex-visceral-dev-reveals-dead-space-2-cost-60-million-and-underperformed-on-4-million-sales/  \nNot a huge one, but a profit nonetheless, certainly enough to allow EA to greenlight a sequel. Keep in mind that a decent chunk of that money was used to shovel in a pointless and unwanted multiplayer mode.\n\nAlso, Tarmack's video here sheds light on the costs that EA, Activision and Ubisoft have, and generally, they've actually decreased.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qq6HcKj59Q  \nFun fact, in 2016, Activision spent double the amount on marketing in comparison to research and development.\n\nTo typify and discredit the disingenuous unfounded myth, EA told their investors that Battlefront 2's microtransaction removal would have no material impact on their earnings. My interpretation is that they're just admitting that any microtransaction revenue is as close as you can get to pure profit:  \nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/ea-tells-investors-turning-off-battlefront-2s-microtransactions-will-not-affect-earnings/\n\n\n **Competitors get to capitalise**:  \nPerhaps the final shock to the system needed is a game that disproves the nonsense and gives the gamers what they want. A large, AAA title with no microtransactions/paid loot boxes, with a huge sprawling narrative that is widely successful. We’ve already talked about Sony’s ability to capitalise on the AAA single player market (and no, I don’t think John Kodera is going to mandate they go all in on GAS, if at all considering what may be coming), but there are more. Specifically CD Projekt Red. I believe Cyberpunk 2077 will be that game.\n\nIt doesn't mean it will be the only one though. Bethesda, Capcom, Square Enix (semi-back peddling on the GAS prominence statement already before they see any returns on stuff like Dissidia), Obsidian, Sony and even to an extent, Eidos Montréal have come out and stood their ground against microtransaction/GAS nonsense in some way shape or form, and champion single player stuff.\n\nDavid Anfossi @ Eidos Montréal:  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ycxs53sr  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yco88vjy  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybtlzefr  \nhttps://ibb.co/eZPn2G  \n*Note, he also made a comment replying to an article saying that they're abandoning single player stuff, directly saying it was wrong, but I'm afraid I can't find it. The editor must've corrected that. \n \nShawn Layden @ Sony Interactive Entertainment (time embedded into the link):  \nhttps://youtu.be/tnCbI51JpAM?t=8715\n\nYosuke Matsuda @ Square Enix:  \nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/square-enix-no-microtransactions-console-games/\n\nCD Projekt Red:  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yb2y6y7b  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpk32gnn-MY\n\nObsidian devs:  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybv2a7oz  \nhttps://forums.obsidian.net/blog/9/entry-207-a-note-about-microtransactions-in-our-upcoming-rpg/\n\nBethesda:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPl-YMq2WTM\n\nYou might be thinking that what I'm saying on this front is loose and 100% speculative, but the gaming world is very susceptible to cultural phenomena and cultural change. The current cultural phenomenon is the twitch streaming hype era. In my opinion, that was the driver behind PUBG's success. Once that wears off, what happens? And with events such as the repeal of net neutrality and the slight curbing of information collection in the EU, the market for these online, digital distributed and recurrent revenue streams is looking increasingly volatile to external forces.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying multiplayer gaming as a whole is just going to collapse down a pit, or even that every GAS will be an automatic write-off, I'm just saying that the GAS side of things will be generally less prevalent. It's like MMOs. There was a point at which it was the hotness, but that heat wore off. It didn't really stop WoW or DotA to keep strong for years after the overall market decline.\n\nThese are all just thoughts and opinions, but what do you think?",

It deals with the destruction of an entire society, the consequences of a devastating war, the death of main characters, love, religious persecution, father/son relationships, genocide, social ostracization, and many other things. Looking back, as a child when I first played it I didn't really have an appreciation for these themes or even noticed them. But now as an adult with more experience, it was practically like playing a different game on my second playthrough. I legitimately teared up at the tragic ending, even if the lighthearted fan service of the sequel sort of undid some of its impact. \n\nPerhaps the first game that ever made me teary eyed (several times) was *Kingdom Hearts* (I was a kid haha).  *Lost Odyssey*'s handling of immortality and all of its consequences also made me really pause a few times. In the other hand, the death of a major beloved character in *Gears of War 3* made me laugh my balls off. R.I.P. *Red Dead Redemption*'s ending made me genuinely angry and longing for vengeance. The death of a beloved companion in *Shadow of the Colossus* also moved me quite a bit. There's also quite a disturbing, tragic scene in *The Darkness* that someone reminded me of, which was especially impactful because you are encouraged to spend innocent time hanging out with the character, uncharacteristic in a game where everyone's a prick trying to kill you. \n\nCan you think of any other games that stirred strong emotions (doesn't include stuff like frustration from shitty controls or being griefed in multiplayer matches)?",

        "text": "What is it that bothers in (modern) games right now when it comes to you enjoying fictional world created in front of you? Is it specific for some games or a frequent plague? Does it have to do with some genres or mechanics? \n\nWhat drives me insane is when you see games like Destiny and The Division full of painstaking years of work to make the games look unique and alive, and then they slap ugly UIs over them which completely drive your attention away from all the beautiful and immersive design. I just can't get into it, when ugly numbers and colours are popping into my screen, especially The Division, my god, its pure visual \"noise\" on the screen. Or then again, Destiny's jarring damage numbers popping up, great way to completely make me forget I am in a fictional world with an epic story. \n\nA way for me to tell how good the UI is, is if I can tell what is happening even if I never played the game before. If its clear to me what is happening on screen, I think that is a success at least a minor one, though it might be an unreasonable request for some games.  If its just a bunch of numbers and coloured cues, I don't bother. Funny enough Japanese games either do this great or horrible, they are either minimalist and immersive or they STUFF YOUR SCREEN WITH NUMBERS AND COLOURS AND STUFF, THINGS ARE HAPPENING, FEEL SATISFACTION AND VALIDATION!!!\n\nAnother thing that destroys all semblance of immersion for me is turn based-combat. Sorry but all the atmosphere in Fallout (or any turn based RPG) you established disappears when all of sudden everything freezes and turns into this clunky combat. When I see X-Com and Darkest Dungeon a character \"dodge\" an attack, that just drives me nuts. It makes me feel separated from the game, its like I cannot participate in it. Especially games like X-Com, where a character \"misses\" their opponent when they are a meter away. \n\n\nAlso, the \"Ubisoft\" open worlds. I cannot enjoy  them cause I am constantly and relentlessly reminded they are an Ubi open world with its maps full of icons with boring busy work, constant hints around me that I should do video gamey stuff, like gathering some abstract thing cause it gives you the \"sense of completion\". Even the Witcher 3 has a bit of this, but still Ubisoft is the master of cluttering you with boring jobs that are never marketed cause nobody actually wants to play it for fun. \n\nEDIT: I've gotta another one, this is for the people that want \"realism\" cause its \"difficult\". In some games with heavy survival times, you have to struggle to find ammo for your weapons. However! Some enemies use weapons like you and release endless automated fire on you, but when you kill them and loot them they have like 2 or 3 bullets. That is beyond bullshit and hypocritical and inconsistent. It completely destroys the feeling of a wasteland with limited resources for me.\n",

        "text": "In some ways, I feel like I have..despite being in my early 20's. It just feels like rarely will I play a game and **not** roll my eyes about how cliche or superficial the storyline or characters are. Its not even about the same tired tropes that they rely upon for characters or plot...but also just how poorly constructed they are. I don't necessarily care if something is an imitation of something else...but when its a shitty imitation, then we have a problem. \n\nThe last AA-AAA game that really made me think was *Nier: Automata.* It honestly just feels like the bigger the budget for a game...the more it tries to replicate the absolute worst of superficial Hollywood bullshit. We just don't have many Citizen Kanes, Stanley Kurbicks, Frank Darabonts, Orson Welles, Hitchocks, etc. that will stand the test of time. I feel like maybe our equivalents are Half-Life or System Shock. The average \"hardcore gamer's\" age is creeping upwards with every passing year, so I feel as if this is very important. Furthermore, videogames started eclipsing the box office in terms of $$$ when Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 made more money than Avatar.\n\nI don't know if it makes sense, but I feel as if we have reached the point where videogames honestly rival Hollywood and film in terms of budget and spectacle: Uncharted series, Call of Duty, Wolfenstein II, etc. But in terms of complex characters, storylines, etc...we are still very far behind, especially when compared to arthouse/indie films. We should at least be beating Hollywood on being able to deliver complex characters because like television, videogames have the benefit of time: the average video game will have much more time to properly display nuance and develop characterization. **Make no mistake, I still enjoy blowing shit up on BF1 or competitive gameplay in CS:GO.** \n\nA little background: I read at least one book every 2-3 weeks, in addition to whatever shit I had to read for classes. I am by no means an \"intelligent\" or \"worldly\" individual...but i just feel as if to some extent I have outgrown videogames, at least in terms of storylines, plot, characterization, etc. I feel like the medium at this point can't be as inherently \"deep\" as other stuff because it requires so much time and \"cooks in the kitchen\" to produce something.\n\nI honestly feel as if video-games are \"stunted\" in terms of storylines, characterization, and character development. To make things even worse, **AAA games are becoming more \"cinematic\" by simply regurgitating and recreating Hollywood-esque tropes/archetypes/storylines/characters that are already as superficial as a mini kiddie pool for midgets with broken legs.** No matter how you feel about Uncharted 4, there's no denying that it was still an imitation of Indiana Jones...a movie that predated it by over 3 decades. To make things worse, videogames are becoming *less idiosyncratic* (Mario, Zelda, Banjo-Kazooie, etc) and more steeped with \"realistic\"/relatable elements (older Call of Duty games, Uncharted, Last of Us, etc) so the problem becomes more glaring because there are actual movies, TV shows, or book equivalents to compare with. I theorize that the smaller budgets and technology restraints of the past made it hard to mimic things that you would see in Hollywood films, so they had to get super extra creative. \n\nTo be even more realistic, at this point I'm not asking for the equivalent of some existential indie movie or major text of a \"dead white man.\" But just think about previous \"brainless blockbusters\", they still had way better stories and characters than what we have in videogames. Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Indiana Jones, Alien, E.T., Star Wars, Inception, etc. I'm not even asking for fucking Dostoevsky or David Lynch...just the video game equivalent of \"blockbusters\" with well-crafted and compelling narratives, relatively original premises/plots, likable characters, and a decently developed story that is properly balanced. I feel like Uncharted 4 hit this on the nose except for the original premise part. Other games like Bioshock, Shadow of the Colossus, Deus Ex, Half-Life 2, etc meet most of these criteria or exceed in certain areas very strongly. But at the same time, they are still generally stunted in a few areas, most notable Bioshock (and especially Bioshock: Infinite). \n\nAs /u/pixelpedant said, \n\n&gt;*\"But game stories which genuinely possess such good character writing that I would be deeply moved by them just plain scarcely exist, it seems to me. And when I say \"good character writing\", I mean good character writing by the standards of writing generally, taking off the kid gloves and expecting game writing to be able to represent the same skill as writing in other media, rather than praising game writers for every ham-fisted attempt at a tragic character death, simply because even the mere attempt in and of itself is refreshing, absolutely regardless of the spoken, written or performed content of the portrayal.\"*\n\nBut just think about previous \"brainless blockbusters\", most of which are from over 3 decades ago: they still had way better stories and characters than what we have in videogames. I'm not even asking for fucking Dostoevsky or David Lynch...just the video game equivalent of \"blockbusters\" with relatively original premises/plots, likable characters, and a decently developed story that is properly balanced.\"\n\nWhen was the last time you played a game and felt as if it helped you understand human nature or the world more? When was the last time you played a game that did all of this *without merely blatantly imitating or collaging its message from other popular movies/books i.e. Mass Effect (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc)?*  To be clear, I also really appreciate originality, even if it isn't the most coherent or polished. For example, Hideo Kojima is honestly one of my favorite storytellers across all mediums. His highly idiosyncratic Metal Gear Solid series has helped me understand the military industrial complex, the nature of war, how the age of information has affected society etc. Here's an example,\n\n&gt;\"Metal Gear Solid 2 [has helped me understand and be more curious] about the military industrial complex, disinformation, how technological advanced in information sharing have caused chaos in society, etc. I was quite young when I played it, but even going back to the MGS series...its amazing that Kojima basically predicted sockpuppets, online shilling, and \"memes\" wreaking havoc on society. \"\n\nMake no mistake: I still enjoy awesome visuals/graphics and blowing shit up. It's just that, as I've grown older, I've realized just how superficial or \"stolen\" from pre-existing blockbuster movie/tropes many SP plotlines are. Furthermore, a significant amount of the \"deep\" indie games that people keep referring to that I've checked out honestly just seemed like sophomoric naval gazing from a Reed college dropout. I wasn't too impressed by Life is Strange or Gone Home.\n\nGames like Deus Ex, Yakuza, Fallout 1/2, Planescape Torment, System Shock, Bioshock Infinite (as flawed as it was), etc. are the rare exception despite the lowered entry barriers due to early access, Kickstarter, mod tools, Steam Greenlight, etc. \n\nDo you feel as if the stunting of characterization/plots is due to the increased development costs and complexity/time/expenses required for AAA games? Is the medium still experiencing growing pains because of its relative youth compared to say film or music? Have you outgrown the rate at which videogame plots and characterizations have advanced? I just feel that because now the medium is so much older, there's a bigger market/more room for more complex stories and characters. ",
