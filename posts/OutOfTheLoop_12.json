        "text": "For context I'm autistic. There's a lot of things I've been confused about my whole life but assumed I'd magically understand eventually. I'm 24 and still don't get this one so here I am.\n\nA white t-shirt from Primark is like a fiver. Not very durable but it gets the job done. If you wanted a long lasting one, eco friendly produced, nice fabric etc then that kind of plain white tee would still not be too expensive for most people.\n\nEnter designer brands. A white t-shirt from them is double sometimes triple the price - more if it's a 'luxury' designer brand. Why? Because of a little embroidered crocodile on the left tit? What makes a brand luxury and therefore able to charge extortionate prices for basically the same thing? Can I just hire people to make shirts that say McJelly on the chest and charge ¬£50 a pop?\n\nMy family have always been quite poor but without fail every Christmas they give each other Nike sliders or Gucci dupes. My grandmother wanted to buy me converse trainers and couldn't get her head round the boots I actually liked not being from a designer brand. I have a friend who is the goth of his family and his mum buys him Hollister t-shirts every time she sees him, even hiding or throwing out his preferred clothes when she gets chance. Why? I don't understand why someone's last name on a hoodie makes it somehow better than any other hoodie. It's not even anyone most regular people like or know by name, it's just some fashion figure's last name. They're incredibly easy to dupe as well, all over eBay, every market stall in town. \n\nThe aesthetic value of a thing doesn't depend on uniqueness, I don't mean to imply that - there's nothing wrong with liking a minimal or common design. And I'm all for everyone having their own aesthetics. And I do understand the sense of togetherness you get from wearing the same thing - like sports t-shirts have some cool designs even if I personally don't follow sport.\n\nBut plain designer stuff for three times the price? Make it make sense. Could anyone who loves this stuff explain the draw? Is it just a taste thing like how I don't like oranges? Why would you pay so much for what is basically a regular orange? Is my view just skewed because I grew up and still live in poverty and can't imagine spending over ¬£20 on a t-shirt? What am I missing here?\n\nLacoste t-shirt as an example\n https://www.lacoste.com/gb/lacoste/men/clothing/t-shirts/men%27s-crew-neck-pima-cotton-jersey-t-shirt/TH6709-00.html",
