The whole point of language learning is figuring out how to use the language like natives would.\n\nHowever, there is one word that I feel should be an exception to this rule... themself rather than themselves. Hear me out.\n\n1. The reflexive form of singular you is yourself, so the reflexive form of singular you is themself. Imagine telling someone \"Fix your car yourselves\"\n2. Themself has history: [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/themself](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/themself)\n3. Themself is gradually growing in acceptance.

Themself is accepted in Grammarly.\n5. The only singular alternative to themself is himself or herself, which isn't actually a pronoun: it's two.\n6. I'll admit that many English speakers use themselves... but they also use words like ain't and y'all, and those words aren't taught because they don't follow traditional grammar rules like themself does.",

Driven by a brain that is suddenly fascinated by sex. Users perceive Internet porn as far more compelling than porn of the past. Why is that? Unending novelty. In this Australian experiment, it's not mere nudity but novelty that gets arousals skyrocketing. Subjects watch 22 porn displays. See that spike? That's where the researchers switch to porn the guys hadn't seen before. What happened? Their erections and their brains fired up. Why all the excitement? Mother nature likes to keep a male fertilizing willing females as long as any new ones are around. In that top line the ram, he needs more and more time to **make** with the same old ewe. But if you keep switching females - the bottom line - well she's not the same. He can get the job done in 2 minutes flat and keep going until he's utterly exhausted. This is known as the Coolidge effect. Without the Coolidge effect there would be no Internet porn. This old mammalian program, the Coolidge effect, perceives each novel female on a guy's screen as a genetic opportunity. To keep a guy fertilizing the screen his brain releases the \"go get it\" neurochemical dopamine for each novel mate or image. Eventually the ram will tire but as long as the guy can keep clicking he can keep going and so will his dopamine. With internet porn a guy can see more hot babes in 10 minutes than his ancestors could see in several lifetimes.",

We use 'to' for anything to do with the concept of attachment.\nEg: 'joined to', 'attached to', 'bonded to', 'married to', 'engaged to'. (In fact we couldn't think of any examples where 'to' was used with a verb that wasn't to do with attachment! Let me know if you think of one or if this doesn't exist!)\n\nSo, do we use 'married to' simply because this is an attachment? We think there must be more to this grammar-wise?\n\nB.) When we use the noun 'marriage', we are more likely to use both 'with' or 'to'.\nEg: my marriage with John was unsuccessful\nOr my marriage to John was unsuccessful.\n\nBut for us, we felt that a marriage 'to' someone was a singular choice that happened. Like making a promise to someone, you've done it once and it's completed. But a marriage 'with' someone felt like more of a continued experience. something ongoing.\n\nSo, do we use 'married to' because we're referring to a past, completed event?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the above? Thank you for your help!",

Both sound correct in my head, but you wouldn’t say “there are some dog.” or “there  are a few bird over there.” However, if you replace ‘dog’ and ‘bird’ with a word like ‘cactus’ or ‘octopus’, where the plural form ends in i, both versions of the word make sense in those sentences. \n   \n   Bonus question: is there a name for this kind of word; cactus/cacti, octopus/octopi? \n\nThank you in advance :)",
