        "text": "Welp, whenever I see discussion about Gnome and KDE it basically comes down to \"Gnome is simpler but KDE is more customizable\". I tend to switch my DE/WM pretty frequently between Gnome, KDE and DWM (yeah, I'm a weirdo). And as much as I love all of them, I'm always amused by this paradox that despite of Gnome goal of being super simple DE, at the end of the night KDE is actually simpler in a lot of ways. Let's just compare setting your own keybinding in both DEs. In case of Gnome you just get a popup for a terminal command to put. In case of KDE you get a window, where you choose app and action. Next one, I had issues with drag'n'drop in file roller for a pretty long time in many distros few years back (Gnome 3 days). And when it finally worked, it's currently borked once again after Gnome 40 release. Never had such an issue, as borked basic functionality of their own app in KDE 5. And yet KDE manage that on top of their (also stupid simple) customizability. Even for the developers, Qt, at very least from my experience, manage to be simpler. Things like connecting phone via KDE connect or built in clipboard manager might be consider more of a feature, but that's yet another thing that kinda makes KDE simpler in some way, as it's more functional by default. And yet that's all, as I said earlier on top of not only stupid simple DE customization where you have built in downloader for themes, plasmoids and even SDDM themes but also very simple apps customization. So IMO - KDE is both simpler AND more customizable. But what Gnome's better at is workflow as their default is actually really, really great while in KDE in my experience you either use more or less windows-like workflow either end up with somewhat rough and unpolished state. What do you think about it?",

        "text": "Ok, here goes.\n\n...................\n\nScreenshots:\n\n[https://imgur.com/umEB5A5](https://imgur.com/umEB5A5)\n\n[https://imgur.com/kz5OVHY](https://imgur.com/kz5OVHY)\n\n....................\n\nMD5: 32294faa74487d383892da30f89d3ec0\n\nISO Download / Manifest / README: \n\n[https://pastebin.com/eBFznmtN](https://pastebin.com/eBFznmtN)\n\n....................\n\n\\*\\*Welcome to kNOME!!\\*\\*\n\nkNOME is not a \"distro\", a Desktop Environment, or anything even remotely official. It is just a bare-bones Debian installation using the GNOME desktop environment, where most GNOME apps have been replaced by KDE apps. It's been tweaked for privacy, aesthetics and functionality and burned to an ISO. It can be used in live mode or installed\\*\\* to a disk. (see \"INSTALLATION NOTES\" below)\n\nkNOME is built on top of Debian Sid: the rolling, \"unstable\" branch of Debian. Why Sid, you ask? I got tired of Ubuntu derivatives and wanted to go to the source. I also got tired of doing point-release upgrades and wanted to switch to a rolling distro, but still use Apt as a package manager. Debian has a well-deserved reputation for being conservative with stability, so even running this \"unstable\" version, I haven't run into any major issues, even compared to (supposedly) \"stable\" distros. DISCLAIMER: Though, if a user follows Debian protocol they shouldn't have random breakage, kNOME is still an experiment and comes with no warranty.\n\nIMPORTANT CAVEAT - READ:\n\n[https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-run-debian-sid-relatively-safely](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-run-debian-sid-relatively-safely)\n\n[https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian](https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian)\n\nTL;DR: update around once per week, don't add/mix repos and pay CAREFUL attention when you do upgrades to see that important packages aren't being removed. Mark important stuff as \"manually installed.\"\n\nLiveCD\n\nusername = blank\n\npass = space (hit the space bar, then Enter)\n\n....................\n\nThings to note about this particular \"spin\":\n\n\\-Non-Free and Non-Free-Firmware are included in the sources list.\n\n\\-Brave Browser has been set up with script blocking enabled by default. This offers maximum privacy/security, but will break most sites, so the user can either enable on a per-site basis by clicking the Shield icon &gt; \"block scripts\" toggle , or change this globally in Settings &gt; Shields. History, telemetry and Brave Wallet are also disabled by default, but can be enabled in Settings.\n\n\\-Flatpack is preinstlled, Snap is not.\n\n\\-KDE and QT apps are themed via the \"qt5ct\" tool. Color scheme is set by \\~/.config/kdeglobals. Use Qt5ct to change icons and fonts etc, use Kcolorchooser to edit kdeglobals colors. GTK stuff is themed via Tweaks and/or Gsettings.\n\n\\-Touche (app for custom touchpad gestures) is preinstalled and configured. It \\*only\\* works on X11, not Wayland. Settings can be changed easily in the GUI. Gestures are currently mapped as follows:\n\n\\-General:\n\n3 finger swipe up / down = Overview\n\n4 finger swipe left / right = Quick Tile window to the left / right\n\n4 finger swipe up /down = Maximize / Minimize Window\n\n3 finger pinch = close window\n\n\\-Dolphin:\n\n3 finger swipe left / right = split view\n\n\\-Brave:\n\n3 finger swipe down = close tab\n\n3 finger swipe left / right = switch to tab on left / right\n\n2 finger pinch = zoom\n\n\\-Gwenview:\n\n2 finger swipe up / down = zoom\n\n3 finger swipe left / right = scroll\n\n...etc.\n\n\\*\\*If you wish to reset any settings for any app, simply delete the relevant file in \\~/.config/ then log out / reboot\\*\\*\n\n....................\n\n\\-Main apps (full manifest in link above):\n\nFile Manager: Dolphin\n\nTerminal: Konsole\n\nPhoto Viewer: Gwenview\n\nVideo Player: SMPlayer\n\nAudio Player: Audacious\n\nWeb Browser: Brave\n\nText Editor: Gedit\n\nPrivacy: Veracrypt, Bleachbit\n\n.................\n\n\\-Gnome Extensions:\n\nArc Menu (menu)\n\nDash to Dock (bottom panel)\n\nDash to Panel (top bar)\n\nGnome 4x UI (hide \"search\" until typing in Overview)\n\nRounded Window Corners (borders, shadows)\n\nUseless Gaps (gaps for tiled windows)\n\n\\-Theme stuffs:\n\nGTK = Material-Palenight-BL\n\nShell = Colloid Dark Dracula\n\nIcons = Papirus Dark\n\nColor scheme = Custom\n\nFont: Roboto\n\n....................\n\n\\*INSTALLATION NOTES - IMPORTANT:\n\n\\*\\*ENCRYPTION DOES NOT WORK AT THIS TIME - DO NOT SELECT THIS OPTION\\*\\*\n\nThe User and $HOME are not set up until after first reboot after installation. Because of this, it is necessary to copy the relevant theme / settings configuration files into place AFTER then, so they are present when called upon. When you first log in, everything will look weird, due to this stuff not being there. Fear not!! Here's the fix:\n\n\\-Close all open programs.\n\n\\-Hit the Super key and start typing \"Konsole\" to open a terminal. There is an archive locate in /usr/share/ which has all the config files in it. We will copy it to our $HOME folder with this command:\n\nsudo cp /usr/share/knome-home-2023-03-17.tar.gz \\~/\n\n\\-Open Dolphin (again, hit the Super key and start typing) and then Ctrl+M to show Dolphin menu &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden Files.\n\n\\-Right-Click the archive and extract it, then select all the files and folders, copy and paste all into your $HOME folder. Select \"Write Into Folders\" and \"Overwrite / Replace\" files.\n\n\\-Log out, then back in and Enjoy!!\n\n....................",

If you want to read more about “network namespaces” you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-network-namespace-part-3-7f8f8e06fef3](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-network-namespace-part-3-7f8f8e06fef3). Also, for a reminder you can also check out the diagram below ([https://wizardzines.com/comics/network-namespaces/](https://wizardzines.com/comics/network-namespaces/)).  \n\n“netns” is responsible for cleaning up network namespaces. When a namespace is destroyed the kernel adds it to a cleanup list. The kernel thread “netns” goes over the list and performs the cleanup process using the “cleanup\\_net()” function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.3/source/net/core/net\\_namespace.c#L565](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.3/source/net/core/net_namespace.c#L565)).  \n\nIf you want to see where all the magic happens is in “\\_\\_put\\_net()” which queues the work on the “netns” to execute “cleanup\\_net()” function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc4/source/net/core/net\\_namespace.c#L649](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2-rc4/source/net/core/net_namespace.c#L649)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4khqc93obuna1.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=99c40b16fa8426d5af65ca7864ae932f1fa4f1de",

        "text": "Yes, I get it, Perl's `rename` is pretty good. You can use Perl's built-in regular expressions, it's authored by the man Larry Wall himself. The `util-linux` version of rename called `rename.ul` exists in some repos to cause mass hysteria and confusion (I'm kidding).\n\nBut have you ever tried `vimv`? As the name suggests, it's like `vi`, the text editor, and the `mv` command together!\n\nBasically, you run `vimv` in the current directory, and it pops open a list of files and directories in Vim (or `vi`), and then you can just simply use regular Vim commands to rename files/folders. It is so much more powerful and flexible than `rename`. Using `vimv` to rename files is like trying to use a stream editor like `sed` as an actual text editor. `vimv` is much more interactive, `rename` is not.\n\nWhile `vimv` has no dry-run like `rename` as far as I know, I'm using snapshots now, so it's not a big deal. If I screw up, I just restore files from my snapshots.\n\nI do think `vimv` needs manpages and more attention and stuff, but MAN is this thing GOOD, so good in fact that it really needs to be packaged in every repo everywhere, and consistently maintained.\n\nIt's crazy to think about, but I use `vimv` all the time, and can't possibly think about not using it to rename files. It's so convenient for my many needs, especially when archiving files. Haha.",
