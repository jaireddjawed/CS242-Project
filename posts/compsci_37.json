Working on a graph-based project where I have a group of n users who live in different areas\n\nEach user has:\n\n* Name &lt;string&gt;\n* WillTravel&lt;float&gt;\n* Home &lt;*-&gt;Area Node&gt;\n\nI've already precalculated the distance between all area nodes.  What I'm trying to find out is the area node with the minimum sum of the distance between all users starting area nodes. \n\nSo if you have areas &lt;A, B, C&gt;\n\nand users &lt;w, x, y, z&gt;\n\nyou have a matrix: \n\n       A  B  C\n    w  5  3  6\n    x  7  5  6\n    y  9  8  6\n    z  3  4  4\n\nit would show that the sum of distances for A would be 24, B would be 20, C would be 22, and so it would choose B (or [B, C, A] in that order)\n\nMy question is this.  The number of users are unlikely to be greater than ten, the number of areas rarely greater than 200.  Brute forcing this as O(n^2) doesn't really seem to be that big a deal, considering \"adding and comparing which is bigger\" (unlike, say, cube roots) isn't that expensive an operation. \n\nWhat I suppose I'm asking is if you think this is something best suited to some multifactor version of Djikstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes, or if this is simply something you can brute force and be done with it?

        "text": "I'm skimming through the book \"Cracking the coding interview\" because I was asked to get ready for, you guessed it, a coding interview.\n\nWhile reading that book I came across the following problem:\n\n&gt; Circus Tower: A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower.\n\nIf we sort the people wrt one attribute (in descending order), we end up with the problem of finding the *longest non-increasing subsequence*.\n\nThere's the obvious O(n^(2)) method: if we know the solution for the last k elements (I like to start from the right), then we can find the solution for the last k+1 in time O(k).\n\nWe can do better, I thought, and came up with a pretty simple O(nlogn) method, but then I read this:\n\n&gt; An O(n log(n)) algorithm does exist, but it is considerably more complicated and it is highly unlikely that you would derive this in an interview -- even with some help.\n\nSo maybe my method is wrong?\n\n---\n\n**If possible, I'd like to know whether my method is correct without having to read any solution (no spoilers, please!). That's why I'm asking here instead of googling for it. If you think it's wrong please point out the mistake or give me a counterexample and I'll think about it.**\n\n---\n\nMy method boils down to this: we proceed as before but we keep track of the length of longest k-ss for each \"interesting\" k, where k-ss means *subsequence which only contains values &lt;= k*.\n\nLet's say we have:\n\n    1 2 4 7 8 9 11   (k)\n    1 4 6 6 6 7 10   (max length)\n\nThis means that, for instance, the longest 7-ss has length 6 and the longest 9-ss length 7.\n\nNow let's say we want to extend the solution to the left and we get a 5. We can certainly prepend 5 to the longest 4-ss but not to the longest 7-ss, for instance. Let's prepend 5 to the longest 4-ss: we get a longest 5-ss of length 7:\n\n    1 2 4 5 7 8 9 11   (k)\n    1 4 6 7 6 6 7 10   (max length)\n\nBut something's wrong. How is it possible that the longest 7-ss is shorter than the longest 5-ss when each 5-ss is also a 7-ss?\n\nMy first instinct was to update the other lengths as well:\n\n    1 2 4 5 7 8 9 11   (k)\n    1 4 6 7 7 7 7 10   (max length)\n\nBut then I thought: why should we care about the longest 7-ss being 7 elements long when we already know that the longest 5-ss is also 7 elements long? Surely, anything we can prepend to a 7-ss we can prepend to a 5-ss, so let's drop 7, 8 and 9:\n\n    1 2 4 5 11   (k)\n    1 4 6 7 10   (max length)\n\nTherefore, we can assume that the lengths are *strictly* increasing.\n\nNow updating the ordered structure becomes easy because we can only have 1 collision at most. For instance, if we add 4 we have:\n\n    1 2 4 5 11   (k)\n    1 4 7 7 10   (max length)\n        ^\n\nand so we can drop the 5:\n\n    1 2 4 11   (k)\n    1 4 7 10   (max length)\n\nBecause all the values added (one way or another) to the structure are the result of incrementing old values by 1, we can't have more than 1 collision per insertion.\n\nThe insertion and the resolution of the collision can be done in O(logn) and we need to do O(n) insertions, so the method takes time O(nlogn).",

I'm trying to get into a specialization in this field, however due to the vast number of specializations, I'm having a hard time trying to figure it out.\n\nI've managed to narrow down my choices to two : **Artifical Intelligence** &amp; **Human-Computer Interaction**. However for the love of God I'm unable to decide which to pick.\n\nI'd really be grateful if someone could help me out here. Thank you.",
