As I\u2019m writing this from the perspective of a first time watcher, Darth Vader isn\u2019t a concept yet, and who the heck knows who the Sith Master is.\n\nSecond is A New Hope (with the note that it takes place many years after TPM). Threepio and Artoo are together on some random starship, which immediately adds intrigue and tells us that things have really changed along with the new empire. We meet Luke and probably make the assumption that Anakin and Padm\u00e9 grew up and had a kid. Obi-Wan\u2018s an old man now, and Anakin was killed Darth Vader. No clue what happened to Padm\u00e9, other than the fact that she\u2019s probably dead. We learn something called the Clone Wars happened, and that Obi-Wan taught Vader after Anakin (which he definitely had time to do considering how old he looks compared to when we last saw him). Obi-Wan dies, we probably think about Qui-Gon\u2019s death, and we finish the movie.\n\nNext we have Attack of the Clones. Ani\u2019s all grown up and everything\u2019s very bittersweet now that we know they\u2019re both killed by Darth Vader. Sure enough, our logical assumption was logical and grown-up Anakin and Padm\u00e9 have a thing. We hear the Imperial March for the first time, after Anakin kills the Sand People and the clones are shipped out for war, but only connect the music as ominous. We learn what Obi-Wan meant in ANH when he mentioned the Clone Wars, and start wondering when the heck we\u2019re going to meet little Darth Vader.\n\nAfter AOTC is Empire Strikes Back. We hear the Imperial March a lot when Vader\u2019s onscreen, and make the assumption that it\u2019s the general \\~evil\\~ music. Luke meets Yoda, and we\u2019re all very excited since that last time we saw him he was having a full-blown wizard\u2019s duel with Dooku. He acts like a backpack, and Leia and Han do stuff that doesn\u2019t connect to the prequels at all. No mention of Padm\u00e9 yet. Bespin happens, Vader reveals he\u2019s Luke\u2019s father and f\\*\\*\\*. That actually makes sense.\n\nNext is Revenge of the Sith and dang it Anakin! Why\u2019d you have to be evil!? Also, it turns out one of the random background senators from ATOC is Leia\u2019s dad, which is pretty cool. They don\u2019t really look alike, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve met her mom. Stuff happens, turns out the creepy Supreme Chancellor is the Sith Lord, which we really should have seen coming, even if he\u2019s not half as wrinkly as he was in ESB. Anyway, Anakin\u2019s Vader, he and Obi-Wan fight and\u2026 Luke and Leia are twins??? When the heck did that happen?? Vader\u2019s got his suit and  Luke and Leia? Twins?? (I guess that explains the mind talking thing from Empire, though)\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve got Return of the Jedi. Han gets rescued and wow. Luke and Leia are twins. Luke goes to see Yoda and IT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO LEARN THEY WERE TWINS BEFORE THE HOTH KISS THANKS OBI-WAN. More stuff happens, we FINALLY get a mention of Padm\u00e9, only for Luke to later go and practically quote her in front of Vader and HE MENTIONS OBI-WAN INSTEAD. Anyway, disappointing lack of Padm\u00e9 aside, the ending fight is great in all ways, stupid Palpatine finally dies, Anakin dies, which is sad, but at least he\u2019s good again. Sad\/sweet funeral scene that mirrors Qui-Gon\u2019s, Ewok party, and we get to see ghost Anakin, which is just\u2026 feelings. The End, Happily Ever After, There Is No Sequel Trilogy.\n\nTL;DR 1 4 2 5 3 6, we learn information in a fun and surprising slow order.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678669344.0},{"title":"Theory as to what this thing in episode 2 of Mandalorian was.

My idea was that they could put out a series about Cal, and make each issue slightly DIY. For example, each time he ignites his lightsaber, the page puts a saber outline and allows you to fill in the color, a classic comic book with a minor modification allowing coloring to things such as The Mantis, his clothing, hairstyles, while allowing the comic to still be an actual comic. It could be a stupid idea but I thought it would be a cool way to allow us all to have a personal experience in a large part of the official Star Wars universe.

I dont want my Star Wars to be morally ambiguous. This always was a kids franchise. Fascism is on the rise...\" and so on and on.\n\nPersonally i am of the opinion the Empire should be **extremely** competent. (I also want to have more empire story lines, but thats just me).\n\nThing is, having an antagonist who's just a fool doesnt make for good story telling. Nobody is impressed if some martial arts fighter defeats a drunk, diabetic cripple in hand-to-hand combat after all. And sadly Star Wars only has these kind of story lines. Andor spiced things up, but even there the foundation of \"Empire cant possibly ever achieve anything\" holds true. The Mandalorian may have been the worst example to date in that regard. I merely think we need to make the bad guys scary again. Like genuinely terrifyingly intimidating -kind of scary.\n\nNow having established how extremely anti-empire this subreddit in particular is: \n\nWhat do you think of the Imperium of Man from the 40k (or 30k) Franchise? I know its an entirely different setting aimed at vastly different demographics with 40k being extremely 18+ by design, but i think the Galactic Empire could really use some of that 40k level of intimidation. Being competent, ruthless, no-nonsense. An opponent who doesnt pull punches just because its Star Wars.\n\nI'd like to know whats your opinion on the Imperium considering just how prevalent the Anti-Antagonist sentiment among you is.\n\nI dont want the Galactic Empire to drop all it is just to copy another franchise. I just want it stop pulling punches. To be scary again.\n\nThis question mostly came to my mind because, as above, this sub is *very* black and white and 40k is the polar opposite. There isnt another discussion on this out there. I looked.

Here's how I think it all comes together and where the show is leading.\n\nThe rest of season two.\n* In the remaining four episodes of S2, I think we'll see 13\/14 be about the batch cutting ties with Cid for good. They've realised how she treats them, and after the core themes of the season (feeling lost, finding purpose, the need for a home) it'll lead directly into the squad reuniting with Rex and Echo. \n* Based on the data from the Zillo beast that the batch sent to Rex, we'll learn about Mount Tantis in 15\/16, where the batch will infiltrate the fortress (why I'm not sure, perhaps Crosshairs sends out a message for help) and escape with Crosshairs and some other clones who are being experimented on. There, Crosshair and Rex will reunite with Cody, who unfortunately has been brainwashed in one of those black suits. Successfully escaping and setting back the cloning operation when Nala Se is killed in action, her last words a whisper to Hunter regarding Omega's true purpose. Escaping barely with their lives, the batch now find themselves with the clone rebellion (and crosshairs) whether they like it or not, determined to fight for all clones across the galaxy...\n\nSeason Three\n* A hypothetical third season features an expanded bad batch as they are now part of the clone resistance, taking up residence on a ruined Kamino. Growing in members after reuniting with Gregor and clone commander Wolfe, they all take on the mantle of Clone Force 99, convincing more and more to their cause. They are hunted by the new mind controlled clones, turning their own against them, lead by Cody. The batch try to build bridges with Crosshair, but find opening back up to him hard after all he did. All roads lead to more and more open rebellion, with eventually hundreds of clones, sporting the colours and armour of their lost companies, commanders and brothers taking on the full force of the empire, where they hold their own but are ultimately overran by the endless waves of newly revealed stormtroopers, and eventually met by Darth Vader himself. With Crosshairs standing up for his brothers, he dies in battle, and Echo unknowingly faces off against his old master when Vader kills him, with perhaps the slightest hint of regret and sadness from the ex-jedi who once helped rescue Echo. The rebellion crushed, the batch and Rex's group are seperated, seemingly defeated, though their victory would not become apparent for many years...\n\nSetting the empire up to fail\n* So, the clones cannot win. The rebellion doesn't fully form until years later, and we know the empire rises to power without the help of the clones. So, wouldn't this feel like a downer ending for the show? That's where I think the secret victory comes in. The clones amass, gather and rebel, leading to the stormtroopers being recruited, trained and pushed through the ranks of the empire early. Too early in fact, for most are barely equipt to fight, and have the aim of someone who's barely ever held a blaster. They may overwhelm and defeat the clones in the end through sheer numbers, but this push set up the stormtroopers to be weak, and despite the empire seeing their visitory as a sign of strength, it eventually sets them to fall, almost two decades of poor training and arrogance later.\n\nAn extra irony\n* In season three we begin to see more brainwashed clones, dubbed 'death troopers', a last ditch attempt to make the clones tools of conformity for the empire. With Cody hunting the group against his will throughout Season 3, eventually they beat him, setting him free as he dies in Rex's arms. Knowing the stormtrooper push eventually helped undermine the empire, an extra level of irony comes from knowing the death troopers, brainwashed elderly clones, were the most powerful of the empire's forces, and had they stuck with clones, perhaps even in their old age, the empire would have a more effective army.\n\nSomehow, Palatine returned\n* While the bad batch is working to improve the Rise of Skywalker by fleshing out the empire's secret cloning efforts, it also plays a key role in the story, as Palptine's efforts to control cloning for himself paid a bigger price than anticipated, with the batch unknowingly setting his plans back years. It's not just helping the weaker parts of the franchise, but the control over cloning and wanting to clone himself directly plays into the themes of the show and the eventual loss of the empire.\n\nWhat about the batch, Season Four and Omega?\n* A few years after the rebellion on Kamino, an aging Hunter, Wrecker and Tech travel the galaxy with Omega. As she rises in power, their rapid aging is beginning to kick in, and after laying low and taking on missions with less need for firepower, the group once again find themselves lost for purpose, and seperated from Rex and the others. I think perhaps it makes the most sense that Omega is indeed a force sensitive clone - I know that's not exactly a huge twist as it's been commonly predicted, but given how she has been shown meditating, praying and overall being quite spiritual, it makes sense for her character, while also showing how close Palatine and the Empire were to having the secret of force sensitive clones, had they known the truth. It all just fits really nicely.\n\nHow does it l end?\n* I don't think the show could end with the clones being defeated, which is why I've given four seasons instead. Carrying on a few years after the big rebellion can help highlight the vistory they've set in motion even after defeat, as well as highlight the rapid aging of the clones. I think a key theme has been about how the clones, supposed to be rigid and unchangeable, have developed not just their own personalities, but their own paths in life, and we'll see a much different Tech, Wrecker and Hunter find a new life for themselves, perhaps one out of the action, where, like Cut, they can have families of their own. As for Omega, she wants to forge her own path, and the show ends with hunter saying goodbye to his daughter, who is now grown and ready to find her own purpose following her growing force powers. If any one character is going to appear in other places in the franchise, it's Omega. Plus, getting another season gives us more time to bridge the clone wars and rebels era. There's still a few more people I'd like to see how up (Omega and Boba pretty much have to meet).\n\nThe changing dynamics of the group\n* I think, no matter how it ends, the most important thing is that the batch changes. They outgrow their original purposes and find new identities. You can see their armour changing piece by piece, and hopefully by the end of the show they all look new and have changed from their programming. Perhaps Hunter sustains a serious injury, maybe even a lost limb, in the escape from Tantis. Going forward, he trains with echo to get used to his disability, and eventually gives leadership of the batch to Tech, who has been learning many lessons this season. As Crosshairs redeems himself and Echo goes from separatist-hater to freedom fighter, we just need an arc for Wrecker as he too changes into something new and unexpected. They begin as soldiers, and end as people.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678623085.0},{"title":"Full size Lego darksaber","author":"Weird_Basil5389","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11p2mcn","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1678587862.0},{"title":"Dark saber question","author":"shweenerdog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11p593j\/dark_saber_question\/","text":"Why does Din Djarin struggle to wield the dark saber but Bo Katan can swing it like a lightsaber?

But I'm hoping that it would be or I'm hoping that they'd return even some of the old Mandalorian clone characters such as Commander Fordo who was such a badass in the 2003 Clone Wars cartoon.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678586553.0},{"title":"At this point, Dooku probably should have realized Sidious wasn't the ideal master.","author":"Jr9065","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/22cdn0t2h1na1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678509600.0},{"title":"Here\u2019s a quote","author":"Soft-Hamster-4525","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11p1wj9\/heres_a_quote\/","text":"\u201cLike you said, only the strongest shall rule\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678585852.0},{"title":"Was anyone reminded of Dr. Demagol when looking at the cyborg creature from SE3EP2 of the Mandalorian?","author":"e_faulkk05","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11p8oh3\/was_anyone_reminded_of_dr_demagol_when_looking_at\/","text":"After watching some breakdowns about Chapter 18 on YouTube alot of things occurred to me. Demagol and this 'unidentified cyborg' share alot in common \n\n1. There practices for experiments\/torture are very similar. In that they are both highly invasive and lickey to result in either death or permanent mental or physical harm. As seen by Darth Malak, respective to Demagol. And Din Djarin's possible fate with this creature.\n\n2. They are both mandalorian or have affiliation to mandalore. Dr. Demagol was a mandalorian scientist and doctor near the times of the Mandalorian War. This creature resides on the glassed planet and aftermath of the Great Mandalorian Purge. Both have affiliation to war and mass destruction.\n\n3. This creature clearly has a pension for blood and screams. Both Demagol and this creature have very psychopathic and apathetic tendencies when it comes to people. Not letting up or showing any form of mercy.\n\n4. The tools and apparatuses used by both are similar in a lot of regards. This point rides alot of the same ideas as No.1. Both have varying degrees of a torture table, an element in which to torture their victims with. Demegol electroshock, and this creature had heat elements. While Demagol used radiation on Darth Malak, this creature siphoned the blood out of Din Djarin's body. \n\n5. These two beings have sort of the same thing going on with their armor, or in the case of the creature, it's entire body. Both are very obtuse and unorganized. Opting for a more ravaged and manic appearance for their armor or body. Both have pipes running down their bodies. The cyborg creature likely uses the metal or fallen mandalorian's armor as a method of customization too. \n\nThat is all I have for their similarities and why I think that this could have been an ever so subtle reference or cue to Dr. Demagol from the old republic era. Great historic figures like Mandalore the Great have also been mentioned too.

Maybe one got a little too much oxygen while in their little bauble and grew up differently, either commended for their differences like the Bad Batch or ended up like 99 who IMO it was kind of an insult for the Kominoains to make him a janitor while watching his brothers go on to become the soldier he was bred to be. I mean, he was clearly tactically sound, make the guy an officer or something...anyways.\n\nThe second is difference in overseers. Jango and his pals raised the clones as well as many Kaminoains. These people obviously couldn't spend ever second with every clone and as we saw from the clones interactions with the Jedi, they'd often start showing the traits of their Jedi leaders or directly contrast them because Clones often didn't vibe well with their Jedi. (Anakin and Rex is actually extremely rare relationship.) Come to think of it, this might of been done on purpose by SHEEV so the clones would have an easier time committing to Order 66 and of course Palpatine would want Anakin to like his CT Officer.\n\n3 is my favorite, which is situation. Let's say Jango Fett hates being last in line so Clones would often rush to be first in line but Clone A gets to the line first because his room is closer to where the line starts so he just gets there faster then Clone B. Clone B, knowing he's going to be later then clone A constantly prepares to be ahead of time so he can beat clone A. A and B often try to one up each other trying to be first in line so they grow into competitive clones while Clone C in the line knows that his room is too far to even try to compete with these two but he has to be in line behind them so he becomes more contempt with his assured position in line. He grows up seeing competition as being kind of pointless if you can't do anything about your position. Then there's Clone D. Clone D is so far back in line, that he never even sees A, B or C so he thinks \"I'm never going to be first so I might as well never even show up to the line in the first place.\" D doesn't even show up to the line, goes to his room and plays Pazaak for hours often forgetting to even go to the line because he's having so much fun playing Pazaak that he is often very late, and is looked down on because of it, so he grows up to resent preset roles and kind of just wants to have fun. Then there's clone E. E is at the back on the line with D and he can atleast see Clone C but since he constantly watches D not even show up to the line, Clone E berates D and often has to deal with his BS because he wants D to show up but D doesn't see a point to it all. E often gets his trouble because he's trying to look out for D and him seeing D not care jades him. Clone E grows up thinking how important roles are and hates slackers.\n\nFourth and final one is age. Clones do have older and younger brothers. The way Jango would interact with older and younger siblings would be reflected in all of the clones all of the time. Now take into consideration the different types of clones who could come about from the situations above, and now put them as the elder or younger sibling in a relationship and how they'd react to their siblings faced with whatever happened above. So let's say a clone with positive mutations, had terrible overseers that he actively works against and was clone C in the line had a little brother who has no mutations, is directly trained by Jango himself and is clone D in the line order. If the younger just randomly bumped into the elder, the interactions between these two would be drastically different than other types of combinations that could come from what is listed above.\n\nSo to put it simply, clones have as much diversity as normal people. They certainly have less time in the galaxy to develop and live very strict lives but them being the same but unique is equal to any human.","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678584799.0},{"title":"Quick sketch of Grogu!

Wouldn't it be way, way, way more in character for Anakin to have done that? Obi-Wan didn't even really want to be there, says something along the lines of \"we're just bodyguards, we're not here to start an investigation,\" hated when Anakin jumped out of the speeder like 2 minutes later and said \"I hate it when he does that,\" implying Anakin recklessly jumping out of things happens frequently enough. And wouldn't Anakin be more willing to do crazy stuff to protect or avenge padme?

Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, had passed away peacefully, leaving behind a legacy of hope and courage. But the Force had other plans for the galaxy.\n\nRey, a young scavenger from Jakku, had discovered that she was strong in the Force. With the help of Chewbacca and the droids BB-8 and C-3PO, she had joined the Resistance and fought against the First Order, led by the evil Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren.\n\nIn the final battle, Rey had faced Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel, and had overcome him with her courage and determination. She had spared his life, hoping that he would turn away from the dark side of the Force.\n\nBut the victory had come at a great cost. Leia Organa, the leader of the Resistance, had sacrificed herself to destroy the First Order's flagship. Poe Dameron, the daring pilot, had lost his best friend Finn, who had given his life to protect the Resistance.\n\nWith the First Order defeated, Rey had traveled to the planet Ahch-To, where Luke Skywalker had lived in exile. There, she had found a hidden Jedi temple, and had begun to train a new generation of Jedi.\n\nAmong her students were Ben Solo, the redeemed Kylo Ren, who had renounced his old name and his allegiance to the First Order, and had vowed to make amends for his past mistakes. He had become Rey's most devoted student, and had mastered the ways of the Force with astonishing speed.\n\nBut the galaxy was not at peace. A new threat had emerged from the shadows, a dark cult called the Sith Eternal, who worshiped the memory of Emperor Palpatine, the former leader of the Galactic Empire. They had rebuilt the Death Star, and had planned to use it to destroy the new Republic and establish a new Sith Empire.\n\nRey and her students had received a distress call from the planet Exegol, where the Sith Eternal had built their fortress. They had traveled there in secret, hoping to stop the Sith's evil plan.\n\nBut they had walked into a trap. The Sith had captured Rey and her students, and had brought them before the resurrected Emperor Palpatine.\n\nPalpatine had revealed that he had created Rey, using his own Sith powers, and that she was his true heir. He had offered her the chance to join him and rule the galaxy together.\n\nRey had been tempted by the offer, but had refused it. She had declared that she was a Jedi, and that she would never join the dark side.\n\nThe Sith had unleashed their army of Sith troopers, and a fierce battle had ensued. Rey and her students had fought bravely, but they had been outnumbered and outmatched.\n\nJust when all seemed lost, a miracle had happened. The spirits of the old Jedi, including Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker, had appeared to Rey and her students, and had given them the strength to overcome the Sith.\n\nTogether, Rey and Ben Solo had faced Palpatine in a final duel. They had used all their skills and powers, and had defeated the Sith Lord once and for all.\n\nWith the Sith defeated, Rey and her students had returned to the galaxy, and had begun a new era of peace and prosperity.

Last Name: Unknown\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nAge: 35\n\nAppearance: Wyatt has brown, slicked back hair and a distinctive line scar that runs down his left eye. He wears a menacing all-red mask with blood-print hands on the cheeks and black anti-lightsaber armor.\n\nBackground: Wyatt was born on the planet Vjun, into a powerful and influential family. He was trained in the ways of the dark side from a young age, and his natural talent and strength in the Force were quickly recognized. After Wyatt killed 100 Jedi in a single minute, he was granted the title of Sith Marauder.\n\nPersonality: Wyatt is determined and brave, with a ruthless streak that allows him to achieve his goals at any cost. He craves power and is determined to be one of the strongest entities in the galaxy, feared by all who oppose him. He is highly loyal to the dark side and believes that the strongest individuals should live, but he also believes in giving others a chance to learn and develop their own power.\n\nAbilities: Wyatt is known for his prowess in lightsaber combat, having mastered every fighting form available to him. He also has an almost scary connection to the Force, and is a peak human in terms of strength. Wyatt can be prone to losing control when he gets angry, but his power and determination make him a formidable opponent.\n\nRelationships: Wyatt has a close relationship with Darth Vader and Darth Revan, who recognized his potential and helped him develop his skills. He is highly respected by the dark side and has a large following of admirers.\n\nBeliefs: Wyatt has a fascination with Yoda and is almost angry at the fact that the Jedi Master hasn't turned to the dark side. He believes that the strongest entities should be the ones to survive, but he also has a strict code when it comes to killing, never targeting children.\n\n\nStory:\nBook 1 \nWyatt: The Rise of a Sith\n\nChapter 1: Birth on Vjun\n\nWyatt was born on the planet Vjun, a harsh and unforgiving world where power and strength were prized above all else. His family was among the wealthiest and most influential on the planet, and from a young age, Wyatt was groomed for greatness.\n\nAs the eldest son of his family, Wyatt was expected to carry on the family legacy and become a powerful leader in his own right. His father was a prominent politician and a skilled warrior, and his mother was a shrewd businesswoman with connections throughout the galaxy.\n\nFrom an early age, Wyatt showed signs of great strength and potential. He was fiercely competitive and driven to succeed, and his natural abilities with the Force set him apart from his peers. He was also a quick learner, absorbing new information and skills at an impressive pace.\n\nAs he grew older, Wyatt began to understand the importance of power and influence on Vjun. He saw firsthand the rivalries and feuds between the planet's most powerful families, and knew that he would need to be strong and cunning to survive in this world.\n\nDespite the pressures of his upbringing, Wyatt had a rebellious streak. He chafed under the strict rules and expectations of his family, and longed for something more. He dreamed of adventure and excitement beyond the confines of Vjun, and yearned to explore the galaxy and test his skills against the best and brightest.\n\nBut for now, he would have to bide his time and continue his training. He knew that his destiny lay in becoming a powerful Sith, and he was determined to do whatever it took to achieve that goal. \n\n\nChapter 2: Early Training\n\nWyatt\u2019s early training in the ways of the Force began shortly after his fifth birthday. His father, who was a powerful Sith Lord, knew that his son had the potential to become a great warrior and leader. Thus, he arranged for Wyatt to be taken under the tutelage of a respected Sith teacher.\n\nWyatt was initially overwhelmed by the training, as he had never been exposed to the Force before. But he soon learned to harness his natural abilities and strength. His teachers were impressed by his ability to focus and his natural instincts for combat.\n\nThe young Sith learned quickly and soon became adept at basic Force techniques such as telekinesis, mind tricks, and Force push. He also showed a remarkable affinity for lightsaber combat, quickly mastering the basic forms.\n\nDespite his young age, Wyatt was incredibly determined and disciplined. He would often spend hours each day practicing and refining his skills. His teachers were impressed by his work ethic and dedication, and they began to see him as a potential star pupil.\n\nAs Wyatt progressed through his early training, he began to realize that he was different from the other students. He had a deeper connection to the Force, and he was able to tap into its power in ways that others could not. This realization both excited and frightened him, as he knew that his potential for greatness was immense.\n\nBut with the power of the Force came great responsibility, and Wyatt was keenly aware of this fact.\n\n\nChapter 3: Family Tensions\n\nWyatt had always been aware of the power struggles within his family. But as he grew older, those tensions became more pronounced, and he found himself caught in the middle of them.\n\nHis father, a powerful Sith Lord, was constantly at odds with his uncle, who was equally ambitious and cunning. They were always vying for more power, more influence, more control.\n\nWyatt tried his best to stay out of it, to focus on his training and his own path to becoming a Sith Lord. But it was difficult when he saw the way his father and uncle looked at each other, the way they spoke to each other, the way they fought over every little thing.\n\nOne day, when Wyatt was in his early teens, he overheard his father and uncle arguing about who should be in charge of a particular mission. His father insisted that he was better suited for the task, while his uncle argued that he had more experience and should be given the opportunity.\n\nWyatt listened intently, feeling a knot form in his stomach. He didn't like the way they were talking to each other, the way they seemed to be trying to one-up each other at every turn.\n\nFinally, he couldn't take it anymore. \"Why can't you two just work together?\" he blurted out, surprising both his father and his uncle.\n\nThey both turned to him, surprised by his outburst. \"What do you mean, boy?\" his father asked, his voice cold.\n\n\"I mean, why do you have to fight over every little thing? Can't you see that you're both on the same side? You both want power and control, right? So why not work together to get it?\"\n\nHis uncle chuckled, a sly smile spreading across his face. \"You're more clever than I thought, boy. Perhaps you should be the one in charge.\"\n\nWyatt felt a surge of pride at his uncle's words, but he knew better than to let it show. He still had a lot to learn, a lot of training and discipline to go through before he could even hope to be considered for a leadership role.\n\nBut the tension between his father and uncle didn't dissipate, and Wyatt knew that there would always be struggles and rivalries within his family.\n\n\nChapter 4: The Jedi Attack\n\nWyatt had always known that his family was powerful, but he had never truly understood the extent of their influence until the day the Jedi attacked.\n\nHe was only twelve years old at the time, but he could remember the events of that day like they had happened yesterday. He had been sitting in his father's study, watching as his father and uncles discussed politics and the state of the galaxy. His mother had been there too, her usual stern expression softened slightly as she watched her son play with a holopad on the floor.\n\nSuddenly, the room had been filled with the sound of blaster fire and the clash of lightsabers. Wyatt had looked up in confusion, only to see several hooded figures entering the room. They were Jedi, he realized with a start, their blue and green lightsabers illuminating the room in a kaleidoscope of colors.\n\nHis father had drawn his own lightsaber, a deep crimson color that Wyatt had always found mesmerizing. He had been a skilled warrior, trained in the ways of the dark side by his own father before him. But even he had been no match for the Jedi, who fought with a ferocity and skill that Wyatt had never seen before.\n\nWyatt's mother had pushed him towards the door, urging him to run and hide. But he couldn't tear his eyes away from the fight, watching in horror as his father was struck down by one of the Jedi. His uncles fought bravely, but they too were eventually overcome by the Jedi's superior numbers.\n\nWyatt knew then and there that he would never forgive the Jedi for what they had done. His father had been everything to him, his mentor and his guide. He had taught him how to harness his powers, how to channel his anger and use it to his advantage. And now he was gone, cut down by those who claimed to be defenders of the peace.\n\nAs the Jedi left, Wyatt's mother had gathered him in her arms, holding him close as he cried for his father. But even as she comforted him, he could feel a burning anger growing within him. He would make the Jedi pay for what they had done, he swore to himself. He would become stronger than any of them, and he would make them fear him.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, his voice trembling with emotion. \"I want to learn how to fight like father did. I want to be strong, like him.\"\n\nHis mother had looked down at him, her eyes softening with a mixture of love and sadness. \"You will, my son,\" she said. \"But you must be patient. Your time will come.\"\n\n\nChapter 5: Revenge\n\nWyatt had never felt such burning anger before. The Jedi had taken everything from him - his father, his family's power, his sense of security. He knew he could never rest until he had exacted revenge upon them. And so, Wyatt began to take steps towards joining the Sith.\n\nHe knew it was a dangerous path, but he felt he had no other choice. The power he would gain from the dark side of the Force was the only way he could hope to avenge his father's death. He began to seek out other Sith, learning what he could from them and showing them what he was capable of.\n\nIt wasn't long before Wyatt was noticed by a powerful Sith Lord. The Lord saw potential in Wyatt and took him under his wing, teaching him the ways of the Sith. Wyatt's thirst for power and revenge made him an eager student, and he quickly became a formidable force to be reckoned with.\n\nAs he continued his training, Wyatt's anger and hatred towards the Jedi grew stronger. He began to focus all his energy towards becoming stronger and more powerful, with the ultimate goal of destroying the Jedi order.\n\nOne day, as he meditated in the darkness of his chambers, he heard a voice whispering to him. It was a voice of power and temptation, and it promised him even more power if he would only give himself fully to the dark side. Wyatt hesitated for only a moment before accepting the offer.\n\nHe emerged from his meditation a changed man, his eyes burning with the red glow of the dark side. He knew there was no turning back now, and that he would do whatever it took to achieve his ultimate goal of revenge. The Jedi would pay for what they had done to his family, and he would make sure they feared the name Wyatt.\n\n\nChapter 6: Mastering the Dark Side\n\nUnder the tutelage of the most powerful Sith masters in the galaxy, Wyatt honed his skills in the ways of the Dark Side. He became a master of the lightsaber, and his Force abilities grew more powerful by the day. He spent long hours training with his fellow Sith apprentices, learning new techniques and tactics, and sparring with one \n\nanother to test their abilities.\n\nWyatt's natural talent and determination impressed his teachers, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the Sith order. He relished the power that came with his new status, and eagerly embraced the darkest aspects of the Force. As he continued to push his limits and test the boundaries of his power, he discovered new depths of strength within himself that he had never thought possible.\n\nOne day, as Wyatt was sparring with a fellow Sith apprentice, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his body. He unleashed a powerful burst of dark energy, sending his opponent flying across the room. The other apprentices stopped their training and stared at him in awe.\n\n\"You are strong,\" one of his fellow apprentices said, bowing to him in respect. \"I have never seen anyone wield the Force like that before.\"\n\nWyatt grinned, relishing the praise. \"The Dark Side has given me power beyond my wildest dreams,\" he said. \"And I will continue to master it until there is no one left who can stand against me.\"\n\nAs he continued to train and grow stronger, Wyatt began to feel a sense of invincibility. He knew that he was destined for greatness, and that no one could stand in his way. His teachers warned him to be careful, to not let his arrogance blind him to the dangers of the Dark Side, but he paid them no heed. He was too consumed by his lust for power and his desire for revenge against the Jedi who had killed his father.\n\n\"I will not stop until the Jedi are all destroyed,\" he said to himself, as he continued his training. \"And I will do whatever it takes to make that happen.\"\n\n\nChapter 7: The Battle of Coruscant\n\nThe sky above Coruscant was filled with the deafening sounds of blaster fire and the hum of lightsabers. Wyatt stood among the ranks of the Sith, his eyes fixed on the enemy lines. The Jedi had been pushed back, but they were not going down without a fight.\n\nWyatt's heart pounded in his chest as he ignited his blood-red lightsaber. He had waited for this moment for so long, to finally face the Jedi in battle and prove himself to the Dark Lords of the Sith.\n\nThe two sides clashed, and the battle raged on for hours. Wyatt fought with a fierce determination, his lightsaber cutting through the air with deadly precision. He could feel the power of the Dark Side coursing through him, fueling his every move.\n\nAs the battle raged on, Wyatt found himself face-to-face with a Jedi Master. The two locked eyes, each sizing up the other. For a moment, the world around them seemed to fade away as they prepared to fight.\n\nThe Jedi made the first move, charging towards Wyatt with a swift strike. Wyatt countered, parrying the blow with ease. The two fighters clashed, their lightsabers creating a shower of sparks with each blow.\n\nThe battle was intense, and Wyatt could feel his strength starting to wane. But he refused to give up, pushing himself to the limit. The Jedi was strong, but Wyatt was determined to emerge victorious.\n\nIn the end, it was Wyatt who emerged triumphant, his lightsaber slicing through the Jedi's defenses and striking a fatal blow. The Jedi fell to the ground, defeated.\n\nAs the battle came to a close, Wyatt stood among the victorious Sith. He had proven himself to be a fearsome warrior, and his reputation among the Dark Lords of the Sith only grew.\n\n Chapter 8: The Seduction of Power\n\nWyatt stood atop a balcony overlooking the dark and twisted landscape of Korriban. He had come a long way since his childhood on Vjun, and he could feel the weight of his power resting on his shoulders.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" Wyatt said to his closest advisor, a fellow Sith Lord named Xander. \"I am destined for greatness.\"\n\nXander nodded slowly. \"Indeed, my Lord. But be careful not to let your ambition consume you. Power can be a seductive mistress.\"\n\nWyatt scoffed. \"I am not so weak as to be seduced by power. I control it, not the other way around.\"\n\nXander bowed his head. \"Of course, my Lord. But remember, the stronger you become, the more enemies you will make. The Jedi and the Republic will not stand idly by while the Sith rise to power.\"\n\nWyatt turned to face Xander, his eyes blazing with anger. \"Let them come. I am not afraid of the Jedi or the Republic. They will all bow before me.\"\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, Wyatt became more and more obsessed with gaining power. He would spend hours poring over ancient Sith texts, seeking any knowledge or technique that would make him stronger.\n\nHis fellow Sith Lords began to whisper that he was becoming too dangerous, too unpredictable. But Wyatt paid them no mind. He was on a mission to become the most powerful Sith in the galaxy, and he would let nothing stand in his way.\n\n\n\nChapter 9: The Betrayal \n\nAs Wyatt rose in the ranks of the Sith, he found himself becoming more powerful and influential. He relished in the fear he instilled in others, and reveled in the admiration and respect he received from his fellow Sith.\n\nBut as his power grew, so too did his paranoia. He began to suspect that there were those who coveted his position, and he constantly watched his back, always on the lookout for any sign of treachery.\n\nIt was during one of these moments of hyper-vigilance that Wyatt stumbled upon a plot to overthrow his mentor, Darth Vader. The revelation shook him to his core. He had been loyal to Vader for years, and the thought of turning against him was unfathomable.\n\nBut as he dug deeper, he found that the plot was real, and that some of his closest allies were involved. Wyatt knew that he had to act quickly if he wanted to save Vader, and himself.\n\nHe began to work in secret, gathering information and building alliances with those he knew he could trust. It was a delicate dance, and he had to be careful not to be discovered.\n\nFinally, the day of the coup arrived. Wyatt was ready, and he struck swiftly and decisively. In a matter of hours, he had eliminated the traitors and saved Vader's life.\n\nBut the victory was bittersweet. Wyatt realized that he could never fully trust anyone in the Sith Order, and that he would always be looking over his shoulder, waiting for the next betrayal. The knowledge weighed heavily on him, but he pushed it aside. He was determined to remain in power, no matter the cost.\n\n\nChapter 10: The New Sith Order \n\nAfter the events of the betrayal, Wyatt found himself in a state of turmoil. He had always been loyal to the Sith, but the recent events had shaken him to his core. He knew that he needed to make a decision about where his true loyalties lay.\n\nAs he sat alone in his chambers, contemplating his next move, a familiar voice interrupted his thoughts.\n\n\"Your hesitation does not go unnoticed, young one,\" said a deep, gravelly voice from behind him. Wyatt turned to see Darth Vader, his mentor and one of the most powerful Sith lords in the galaxy, standing in the doorway.\n\n\"Master,\" Wyatt said, rising to his feet and bowing. \"I...I have been struggling with my loyalty to the Sith.\"\n\n\"Explain,\" Vader said, his voice betraying no emotion.\n\nWyatt took a deep breath and began to speak. He told Vader about the betrayal he had uncovered and how it had shaken his faith in the Sith. But even as he spoke, he could feel the pull of the dark side, urging him to seek more power.\n\nVader listened silently, his expression unreadable. Finally, he spoke.\n\n\"You are not the first to face such a crisis of faith,\" he said. \"But know this, Wyatt. The Sith are not just a means to an end. They are a way of life. To betray them is to betray yourself.\"\n\nWyatt nodded, but he knew that his decision was not so simple. He could feel the power of the dark side calling to him, tempting him with promises of untold strength and influence.\n\n\"Master, I...I don't know if I can stay true to the Sith,\" he said, his voice shaking slightly. \"But I also know that I can't turn my back on the power that comes with it.\"\n\nVader regarded him for a moment, his eyes seemingly piercing through Wyatt's very soul. Then he spoke.\n\n\"The path of the dark side is not an easy one,\" he said. \"But if you are truly committed to it, then you must be willing to make sacrifices. You must be willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals.\"\n\nWyatt nodded, his mind made up. He knew what he had to do.\n\n\"Master, I am with you,\" he said, his voice firm. \"I will do whatever it takes to help you achieve your goals.\"\n\nVader nodded, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Good,\" he said. \"Then we have much work to do.\"\n\nAnd with that, the two Sith lords left the chambers, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678514872.0},{"title":"Han Solo was the best part of force awakens","author":"ISimplyDontBeliveYou","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11o7ola\/han_solo_was_the_best_part_of_force_awakens\/","text":"He has so many funny lines early on and then shit just gets dark.

He was last seen in an egg bar in a far-off planet called Viroth.\n\nMando arrived at the egg bar and found Dolph sitting at the counter, munching on a plate of eggs. The former actor was much bigger in person than he appeared on the screen. Mando had his hands on his blaster and approached him cautiously.\n\nDolph noticed Mando and smirked, \"Well, well, well, what do we have here?\"\n\nMando didn't reply and instead showed him the bounty puck. Dolph chuckled, \"I suppose it's time to get back to reality.\"\n\nAs Mando moved closer to apprehend Dolph, the actor grabbed a plate of eggs and threw them at him. Mando was momentarily stunned but quickly recovered and subdued Dolph with some protein bars he had on him.\n\nDolph was on the ground, panting. Mando towered over him and said, \"This is the whey.\"\n\nDolph groaned, \"Oh come on, that was terrible.\"\n\nMando chuckled and radioed Greef Karga that he had captured Dolph Lundgren. It was another successful bounty for the Mandalorian, but he couldn't help but think about that pun he just made.\n\nMando secured Dolph Lundgren with binders, and escorted him to the Razor Crest. He was not a big talker, but as they walked, Mando couldn't help but think of the irony of it all.\n\nYears ago, Lundgren was a world-famous action star, playing larger-than-life characters that took on armies of villains, and now, he was reduced to petty theft in a far-off planet, hiding in an egg bar.\n\nThe Mandalorian wondered what could have caused such a fall from grace. Maybe it was the pressure to maintain his physique, or the constant competition with other actors. Or maybe it was the realization that his fame and fortune were temporary, and that he would eventually fade away like all of the stars that came before him.\n\nDolph, for his part, remained silent throughout the trip back to Nevarro. He knew that his career was over, and that his only hope was to strike a deal with the authorities, and hope for a lighter sentence.\n\nAs the Razor Crest landed on the planet, Mando was greeted by Greef Karga and Cara Dune. They took Dolph into custody and Mando received his payment. He was about to leave when Greef asked him if he wanted to grab a drink.\n\nMando was hesitant at first. He had a reputation to maintain, and he knew that the less he interacted with the authorities, the better. But something about Greef's offer seemed genuine, and he found himself nodding.\n\nThey went to an egg bar in the city, and sat down at a table. Greef ordered a round of drinks, and they began to talk. They talked about the bounty, about the state of the galaxy, and about their lives.\n\nMando found himself opening up to Greef, telling him about his upbringing, his training as a Mandalorian, and his journey as a bounty hunter. He was surprised to find that Greef was a good listener, and that he could relate to some of his experiences.\n\nAs they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Greef looked at Mando and said, \"You know, I never thought I would be friends with a Mandalorian.\"\n\nMando looked at him and said, \"This is the way.\"\n\nGreef smiled and nodded, \"This is the way.\"\n\nMando left the egg bar feeling oddly satisfied. He had completed another bounty, but more importantly, he had made a friend. And for a solitary man like him, that was a rare and valuable thing.","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678501743.0},{"title":"Just finished my SW short film!

Title is pretty much self explanatory I reckon and apologies if it's a dumb question. I understand that from a movie perspective it wouldn't be as interesting to watch if they didn't use lightsabers or spent most of the time flinging rocks at each other or choking etc but from an actual universe perspective is there any canonical explanation as to why? This becomes more relevant when we think about the older Jedi who would focus more on being at one with the force etc e.g. Yoda, Qui Gon etc - think about battle between yoda and palpatine as well. Wouldn't we expect there to be more force wielding etc?  I have read that it has something to do with the field or \"aura\" idk that  jedi masters\/sith lords etc have around them that makes it easy to deflect force based attacks but we've seen plenty of instances now where characters are hit by objects used by force etc etc. I'm also thinking of the duel between obi wan and anakin and how there's a point where they're both using the force against eachother (the shot is of their hands opposing eachother) before they're pushed apart like repelling magnets) and wondering if it would amount to a stalemate of sorts between two experienced force users that it boils down to their duelling skills etc?

One of my reservations was how Luke was presented. I didn\u2019t like the petulant and bitter side that was extremely prominent, but I did like the fact that he was withdrawn\u2014both for story purposes (an active Luke would never have allows the FO to emerge) and so he has an arc.\n\n\nAnother thread got me thinking that they could have done this by just making Luke very meditative and mysterious\u2014unreachable not because he\u2019s come to some obviously erroneous conclusion as a result of a misunderstanding as in the movie\u2014but because he is exploring how to intervene in a conflict without violence, including through the power of force projection. This might require years of stasis (as in that cool concept art of him buried in sand). \n\n\nThe conflict between Rey and Luke is still there (active\/passive), and the arc is still there for Luke, but the presentation is much more satisfying because it builds on top of the growth that Luke achieved in the OT and presents a subsequent challenge: how does he continue to be a force for good in the galaxy after having effectively sworn off combat? By looking inside and discovering powers hitherto unknown.\n\n\nThis would also open the doors to additional media chronicling other stuff he got up to before dying. That window is pretty much shut now due to TLJ.\n\n\nAny other ideas for how Luke could have been written into the story in a way that gives him an arc and allows the first order to emerge? Travel outside the galaxy? Or have him be captured and give him a role like Maverick in the new top gun, with a lighter arc about teaching the new generation despite complicated past  familial trauma?","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678428207.0},{"title":"Peli Motto is one of the most annoying characters I\u2019ve ever seen on TV or film.

I'm a big fan of the prequels but this moment is the most important in those stories. And I've never found it entirely convincing how quickly Anakin goes from Jedi Chosen One to killing younglings.\n\nBut I've realised there's actually a simple fix by beefing up an earlier scene. I'm talking about when Anakin confides in Yoda about having visions.\n\nRather than this, Anakin should have felt so desperate about his fear of Padme dying that he approaches the whole Jedi Council, confesses his marriage and that he is the father of her unborn children. He begs them to help save her saying he will do anything.\n\nBut the Council refuse. They explain that they of course knew of the marriage and chose to turn a blind eye. Obi Wan is the most sympathetic, while Mace is totally unforgiving. He threatens to expel Anakin from the Order.\n\nAnakin becomes very angry and after a brief potential for a light saber fight in the Council chamber, he storms out.\n\nFrom there, the interactions with Palpatine (\"not from a Jedi\") have much more meaning for Anakin. \n\nHis discovery of Palpatine as Sidious initially leads Anakin to see it as a way to guarantee the Jedi helping him and Padme. But when confronted with choosing between Mace and Palpatine during their fight, he realises that the Sith are the only ones who are willing to save Padme.\n\nAnd as with his plea to the Jedi Council, he will do anything to ensure that happens, including killing younglings.\n\nAnyway, just a fun thought.

Anyway, she took the Darksaber and killed the knockoff, and the knockoff had taken the saber after beating Din, so I think it's now properly (by Mando custom) hers again.!<\n\n>!So we come to the matter of symbols; I don't think I need to explain the mythosaur and Darksaber around here.  But what is important is that there's two.  Din already had one, the Darksaber, but could never use it with any more facility than I would a solid-iron baseball bat; Bo-katan, on the other hand, uses it like...well, a trained swordswoman with a sword.  On the other hand, I think Din's oddly (for a religious fanatic) more flexible than Bo-katan, and will end up forming some bond or agreement with the mythosaur...whereas Bo-katan will try to take it's skull.!<\n\n>!So I think we're going to end up with a civil war.  On one side are \"Din's Mandos\": traditionalists who value the older symbol (that being the bond with the mythosaur, rather than it's skull hanging over a throne) more, and value Mando society over trappings.  On the other is Bo-katan's ideal Mando society, who want to push themselves back to the forefront of combat and demonstrate that with trophies.!<\n\n>!Side note: I don't think Boba Fett will get much involved.  Before taking a vacation in the Sarlacc (1 out of 5 stars: terrible service, worse housekeeping) he probably would have sided with Bo-katan, but I think now his leanings would be toward Din...but he'd also recognize the stupidity of yet another Mandalorian civil war.!<\n\n>!As for the war itself, I don't think it'll be extended.  In the end Din will take his Mandos, and leave the shell of Mandalore to Bo-katan, just not seeing them as having the same importance as the Mandalorian people.!<","upvote_ratio":0.24,"created_utc":1678423937.0},{"title":"help I'm making fanfiction","author":"ArbiterOfRichard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11n5pu5\/help_im_making_fanfiction\/","text":"Alright so I was making a list of clones for a platoon in the 104th Attack battalion on a whim that had an Arquitens Light Cruiser as their headquarters.

That being Bo Katan finds Mandalore\u2019s mask. For context Mandalore was the title given to some of the great leaders of the Mandalorians and they had a mask simply known as Mandalore and something at the end, the mist famous being Mandalore the ultimate who if you didn\u2019t know was defeated in one on one combat against the Jedi Revan who took his mask and hid it. He eventually came back to the planet he hid it on and he gave it too his Mandalorian ally Canderous Ordo who eventually became Mandalore the Preserver before he died and if I recall it\u2019s not really mentioned if it was destroyed or not when he died, I think it was damaged but not destroyed. This all happens thousands of years before the Mandalorian takes place meaning that if someone found it they would be in a better position of power than having the dark saber plus there\u2019s no rule about giving the mantle to someone who you trust. This is sadly all in legends although it would make sense for them to bring it back since slowly they\u2019ve been reintroducing characters into the Canon (example: Revan being mentioned being the name of one of the sith trooper legions in TROS) and I personally think it would be so cool especially because I love KOTOR and I love the Mandalorian so seeing it would be a huge plus at least for me. Also the reason why they would try to find now is because it was lost to time and perhaps they find something like a manifest or something like that on it\u2019s potential location.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678353366.0},{"title":"It's been exactly 9 years since Fives died (7th March 2014), and I'm still not over it.","author":"I__Am__No__Jedi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11kurle","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678182097.0},{"title":"Looking for worthwhile new star wars content to binge","author":"dadsushi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/11mq1ve\/looking_for_worthwhile_new_star_wars_content_to\/","text":"Hi, I haven't gotten into Star Wars in years (mostly because I thought some of the new canon was disappointing), however it's pretty good again so I'm looking for recommendations of things to watch and\/or read so I'm hoping that you guys could drop some worthwhile lit.

Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Luke (the S-tier main characters of Star  Wars in my opinion) all get a happy ending, and I believe she deserves to be in that elite group.\n\nIn order for this to happen, several other things need to happen:\n\n\\#1: Ahsoka learns Anakin was redeemed. This is the biggest thing unresolved from Ahsoka's character arc, and she can't be truly happy with this thread unresolved.\n\n\\#2: Ahsoka needs to basically \"retire\" from the galaxy, or from fighting in war-like events. When we see Ahsoka at her most recent point in the timeline, she is around 45 years old and has been fighting in some form or another for at least 20 years (from 14 when she enters the Clone Wars to around 34 in Rebels), and she deserves a very long break from that to rest. This could be her death, which I don't like but would be ok with if she learns Anakin was redeemed, moving to a remote part of the galaxy, or possibly going to Mortis somehow.\n\n\\#3: This isn't necessary for her to have a happy ending, but I would like for her to do something with Luke's Jedi Order, such as teaching the students there or storing the knowledge she has in a Holocron. This would give her a connection to the New Jedi Order, which she could impart some wisdom on.\n\nI would like to know what you think about this, and also what you think Ahsoka's ending should be.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678330623.0},{"title":"How powerful was canon Grandmaster Luke before his exile compared to jedi of the prequel era?","author":"throwawayfetish294","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/p6brr8xcjlma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678316598.0}]
