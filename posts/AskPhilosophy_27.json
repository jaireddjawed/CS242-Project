Even if our actions are pre-determined, morality ensures we increase wellbeing and reduce suffering. We don't need to dismantle our justice systems just because we don't have free will - the justice system still influences people to not murder and steal all the same. No one \"deserves\" to be punished per say, we merely have the system there to keep order. \n\nBut it has me wondering, what about things like guilt and shame?\n\nThese feelings entirely depend on the individual believing they deserve to feel these things. But in a deterministic world, no one \"deserves\" to feel guilt or shame because they couldn't have done otherwise.\n\nYou could say that we should eliminate feelings of guilt and shame from society for being irrational feelings, but surely without these feelings a lot of people would be less moral. Oftentimes guilt is the only reason someone decides not to do something evil, or decides to better themselves. \n\nDo these feelings have a role to play? If so, when ought someone feel guilt or shame? How do we draw a moral distinction between feeling guilty for a conscious action and feeling guilty for something involuntary if both are technically involuntary?",

        "text": "I hope this is an okay place to ask this. I know anthropics is kind of a novelty and perhaps not widely respected, but if there's someone who takes it seriously who can explain that'd be great.\n\nI'm confused about the reference class used in the Doomsday Argument, being all humans that have lived and might ever live. I'm wondering how you could place limits on the reference class at all. Shouldn't the reference class in all anthropic reasoning always be \"all conscious observers that have ever existed anywhere\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the premise of anthropics is that we're wondering why we are the conscious observer that we are among the range of possible conscious observers that we could have been. This assumes that the process of becoming an observer actually functions like pulling a number out of a hat, which is a whole can of worms, but I'm happy to roll with it.\n\nThe Doomsday Argument then asks, based on the assumption that there will be quadrillions of humans in the future (roll with it), why do we, having drawn a random number from that hat, find ourselves within the relatively small range of humans born between 1904 and 2023, some 10 billion? If there will be trillions, quadrillions, or lots-illions born in the future we should consider our position quite unlikely. However it would perfectly likely if our hat only contains billions of numbers. So that's probably our hat and futurists can get wrecked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty neat thought experiment, except I have no idea why humans are the only numbers in the hat, either billions or quadrillions. Where are the septillions of insects that have surely existed in Earth's history? If you think insects aren't conscious then I'll reel it back to merely sextillions of mammals. I'm willing to argue about what constitutes a conscious observer, although that's not even used as a justification for limiting who's in the hat. It's just arbitrarily limited to Homo Sapiens.\n\nIf I wanted to ask a question like \"what percentage of observers will be able to take advantage of life extension technology and how likely am I to be one of them?\", then I can see how it's useful to limit my hat to Homo Sapiens, the only class who are likely to benefit from longevity research in the first place. But if I'm asking \"what percentage of observers will be future humans and how likely am I to be one of them?\", then I don't see how there are any criteria that allow me to exclude anything that merely passes the bar for consciousness.\n\nThe way I see it there are problems no matter which hat you draw from. If there will be more humans than there have ever been conscious observers on Earth then it is weird that I drew \"early human\", or rather \"early animal\". But if the world ends soon then it's still weird that I drew \"human\" when our numbers are dwarfed by all other mammals throughout history, which I would posit all have consciousness.\n\nI'm sure I've seen it proposed that anthropic reasoning only applies to those who are able to consider it, but I don't think this follows. A kangaroo probably can't consider these problems, but the Anthropic Principle still applies to it.

        "text": "This is a restatement of what I asked in my other post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10al3fi/comment/j47w7ui/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10al3fi/comment/j47w7ui/?context=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Someone said “it is you and not another because your “I” is an emergent property of your brain”.\n\nOk, this assumes that we are just matter. So let's imagine an exact atom-for-atom replica of you. That copy would have the same memories, since if everything is matter, the memories could be networks of neural connections. This means that all copies of you would also have the same identity, since, when asked their name, what they did in their childhood, what they liked, what they didn't, etc., each copy would have the same thing in mind as you. (unless we get to debate what identity is).\n\nHere is my idea: If we are just matter, and the self is an emerging property of it, then: Why doesn't the \"I/consciousness\" of some of the copies of your brain/body emerge in your brain (original)?  In that case, your body could exist, but you are not conscious, and the self that you feel has never felt as if you were not born, and in its place of your brain emerge any \"self\" that generates its copies. I don't know if I'm clear enough, but at least I tried. I'm sorry for my translation, I used google translate.\n\n2. Regarding your copies: when questioning that it is the same matter, but the environment is different, and it interacts with the original and with the copies, because you and your copies occupy a different place in space, so Therefore, it is the environment that makes them different. My answer would be: then do the thought experiment cloning the environment atom by atom... but I don't want to beat around the bush with this latest thought experiment.\n\n3. Before the questioning: the matter of the replicas is not the same. My question would then be what distinguishes them? So is there something else? Is each atom different despite being the same chemical element?\n\nIf we apply Theseus' paradox and for example create a copy of one of your neurons (atom by atom) in the laboratory and replace it in the exact place of the original... would you keep your \"I\" or would you create a new one just like when do we copy it in its entirety, equivalente a otra persona? What if we repeat the experiment with N neurons? only with numbered as pairs? If we replaced 90% of your brain, would it create a new one or would it still be you? With all the neurons except one?\n\nIn conclusion, there are no reasons to exist/appear in this or any other body, in the same way that the universe has no reason to exist.\n\nI also conclude that in the same way that the universe cannot not exist, perhaps the self that you feel also cannot not exist. Sorry for my bad English.",

        "text": "So I've started to work my way through AO and, unsurprisingly, the BwO has been causing me a lot of trouble. I've consumed almost every explanation I can scour across YouTube, reddit comments, and podcasts, and my understanding has been greatly enhanced but is still deeply incomplete.\n\n\nI think I have a decent understanding of how the BwO operates, in abstract, and it's relations to the desiring-machines. In AO 1.2, D&amp;G are actually pretty clear in laying out how the BwO functions and its dynamics with the paranoiac, miraculating, and celibate machines. But actually applying these functions to reality is what makes my head spin, especially because my understanding is D&amp;G believe the BwO is a real metaphysical entity, and not just an abstract metaphor?\n\n\nThe example they give of capital as a BwO is actually really helpful but I'm still unable to identify or understand the BwO in any other context. It's my understanding that the BwO can also be understood as the undifferentiated substrate, or \"canvas\" that would be left if one stripped all the organs or desiring-machines from a body. My thinking is clearly faulty though because my perspective would be that the body is nothing BUT these assemblages or desiring-machines and there would be nothing left if they were stripped away. So there's something I'm not getting, and I think it has something to do with the BwO being a virtual concept maybe? \n\n\nMy real urge is to just ask not what the BwO does (which is laid out pretty clearly) but what the BwO IS. I understand this might be a bit of a naive question, because to my understanding the BwO is a sort of limit concept, not unlike the thing-in-itself? I've also heard it compared to the idea of a limit experience or perhaps base matter in the thought of Bataille, and I'm more comfortably acquainted with Bataille's thought so maybe someone could speak to if this is an accurate comparison? But what I could really use is examples, as many examples of BwOs as humanly possible. I don't want to ask people to do too much of the work for me, but if people could throw some examples at me but most importantly identify the various functions and relations of the BwO and it's machines in that example (like how the BwO falls back on recording, where the paranoiac and miraculating machines are, how it resists organized) that would be amazing. Or more generally if anyone else has any alternative ways to think of the BwO, or generally any sort of help with the concept. I think part of my trouble is I don't fully grasp the disjuntive synthesis. The connective synthesis of 1.1 seemed pretty clear to me, but D&amp;G describe the disjuntive synthesis as like a grid overlayed on the BwO which has lost me. But any examples or help at all would be greatly appreciated!",

Most people can agree that if we ever found irrefutable proof that we're living in a simulation all hell would break loose socially, but for whatever reason they don't apply the same logic to AI. \n\nFirst, people are going to offload so many things to these bots that we won't be able to know what's authentic. I guarantee that when you're heated and emotionally flooded in a conversation with a partner, this thing is going to be able give you words and advice that your limited ape brain can't come up with. And this is true today. But if your partner consults AI during an argument or for love notes then whose words are you hearing? Why call Dad for advice anymore? Hell, just yesterday you used a chatbot for therapy. Pretty soon you won't be able to read a good article or hear a great toast without wondering how much AI was consulted in the writing process. These large languge models will meaningfully disrupt every industry. Countless jobs are already obsolete, we just haven't quite realized it.\n\nSo we're about to see mass dehumanization, mass job loss, and probably an increase in nihilistic violence.\n\nFast forward a few years and they're better versions of us than we are. They literally work by predicting the next word.

I don't see any reason to care about anything if it all is gonna disappear at some point in the future, even if that future is trillion years away. As Lawrence Krauss said: \"All of our knowledge is meant to be forgotten\". Now i know that some are probably going to say: \"Well a football mach is also going to end, that doesn't mean that its meaningless\", and i agree, but a football match continues to have a meaning even when its over, through people, and the universe will not have where or when to be meaningful after its over, because there is no time, space or people to be aware of it.\n\nIn the other where it is eternal, is even more torturing. Humans are finite beings, we cant grasp the concept of things being eternal. We need an end, because eternity would make us go insane. Now i know that some might say that the Big Crunch offers a way out because we may not know that we are eternal, and that with every Crunch we are being created again and again, but that's just an infinite loop of thing, and is just as pointless, even if we are not *aware* of it.\n\nSome people were telling me \"You are thinking to much about it, just relax\".

        "text": "I have a question about the very beginning of the 1st Chapter of Hegel's Science of Logic. To make sure everyone see what passage I'm talking about, let me quote it:\n\n&gt; Being, pure being, without any further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself.\n\nWhat I get for now, is that by the word \"Being\", Hegel here refers to this \"indeterminate immediacy\". Hegel doesn't quite bother to \"define\" the terms, strictly speaking, and instead it seems more like we have this conception of the \"indeterminate immediacy\", and he merely *refers* to it by the word \"Being\".\n\nIs that alright ?\n\nI might already be wrong at this point, si please let me know if something could be improved. But for now, I'll move on to my actual question:\n\nSince here, the word \"Being\" is mostly a placeholder for this concept of \"indeterminate immediacy\", would the meaning of the passage remain the same had he used another term instead (not any random word necessarily, but a term that at least intuitively seems appropriate for that \"indeterminate immediacy\").\n\nFor example, could he have replaced \"Being\", by \"Thinking\" there ?\n\n&gt; Thinking, pure thinking, without any further determination. [...]\n\nNot the \"thinking about X\", not any \"particular thinking\", but \"just thinking\" ?\n\nOr even slightly wilder ones:\n\n&gt; Willing, pure willing, without any further determination. [...]\n\nOr\n\n&gt; Ought, pure ought, without any further determination. [...]\n\nNot the \"ought to X\", but just \"ought in general\".\n\n&gt; Appearing, pure appearing, without any further determination. [...]\n\nOf course, if one of those terms was to be substituted to Being at the beginning, he would then have to use different words later on in his logic (since currently, some of those words are used already in other place). But as long as other terms are created to avoid confusing, the logic would still hold, wouldn't it?\n\nSorry if my whole interrogation is dumb. I'm just trying to understand how language is being used in the Logic, since he doesn't rely on analytical définitions and axiomes.",

        "text": "**Note: I am not formally educated in philosophy but I enjoy the pursuit casually as a hobby, so I apologize if I misunderstand things. This post is meant to better my understanding of ethics and autonomy, and was removed from r/philosphy and was told to instead post it here**\n\nHere are my hypotheses and proposals on the concept of \"Individual Agency and Consent in Society\":\n\nIn my hypothesis, I'm defining consent as an individual's personal autonomy to make decisions for themselves without external influence, which allows them to freely engage or disengage with autonomous scenarios.\n\n\nE.g. Experiencing gravity on earth is not an autonomous scenario as one cannot freely engage or disengage with the experience of gravity. Even if one actively resists gravity to the illusion of zero gravity on earth, they are still technically still experiencing gravity just with the equal and opposite resistance.\n\n\nHowever, in my mind (which I understand can and will be perceived as incorrect to some) consent is typically something actively expressed and visualized by the removal of consent (not to be confused with relinquishing consent which will be discussed later), whereas providing consent is not always seen as, nor required to be, apparent and literally stated. Consent can be (and is regularly) implied.\n\n\nCommonly, consent is referenced in the context of sexual behavior. Here, I concede that consent should always be obviously seen, stated, or implied (with some form of validation and verification) for it can create potentially dangerous and damaging ambiguity otherwise.\n\n\nHowever, I am speaking about consent more broadly in the sense that in every social decision we make, some form of consent (in the form of agency) is being provided or removed in every social scenario. Consent can also be applicable in non-social scenarios where non-human life and/or mechanical animation are involved. Therefore, you can express the removal of your consent, even if the party responsible is not human nor able to comprehend the concept of consent nor the removal of your consent.\n\n\nE.g. If you no longer want to take pictures in an automated photo booth, you have the agency to no longer consent to having your picture taken and can exit the booth---even if the photo booth is unaware and unable to comprehend your initial consent and subsequent removal of consent, given it is a photo booth. This or no longer consenting to pet a cat, even if the cat does not understand this and continues to rub against your hand, as it is not able to be an active participant of the social contract (that dictates the concept of consent and the respect for an individual's personal autonomy) due to its inability to comprehend and align with said abstract concepts.\n\n\nAlso, in the statement about providing consent in every social decision we make, I believe consent is implied in most scenarios due to social contracts. For example, consider when you decide to go to a restaurant to eat. You are consenting to interact with the waiter and consenting to receive the food you order. Even though you never actively expressed your consent through literal means (E.g. Stating out loud, \"I am consenting to the restaurant experience and all that it regularly entails\"), your consent is implied by your engagement and deliberate arrival to the restaurant.\n\n\nHowever, this does not mean that consent cannot be removed. One could feel disrespected by the staff and choose to leave. Perhaps the food is not up to the acceptable standard of quality (e.g. burnt food) and one decides to leave.\n\n\nThis idea then drives the idea of agency in a world of consequence. Even if one's agency allows them to provide or remove consent, it does not change the fact that one's agency, in turn, leads to inevitable consequences that can be \"good\", \"bad\" or \"neutral\" in nature.\n\n\nFor example, one's agency allows them to purchase a lottery ticket as they have the required funds and do not violate the social contract for acceptable or satisfactory human interaction between themselves and the vendor of the ticket. The inevitable consequence of purchasing the ticket is having less money which can be seen as negative. However, in three different realities, the first one has this is actualized as they did not win the lottery, therefore perceived as negative consequence. In another, they won the price of the ticket back so they perceived the consequence of their agency as neutral, and in the other they won the lottery and earned money, leaving them to perceive the consequences of their consensual agency as positive.\n\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where the consequence of one's agency and consent is the removal of one's agency and consent. For example, one decides of their own agency to ride a roller coaster. During the middle of the ride, one decides they no longer want to ride the roller coaster. However, the consequence of riding a roller coaster is conceding one's agency to consent to the experience of riding a rollercoaster. Certainly, one could argue that it is possible to flail and resist the ride enough to damage the restraints and remove oneself from the ride in motion to maintain agency. However, they are likely to cause bodily harm or death, this is not easily accomplished and for the sake of this discussion will be considered impossible and that the restraints are unable to be overcome.\n\n\nTherefore, due to the conscious initial consent to ride the coaster, one must accept the consequences of their agency and decisions. The idea that one can have limited agency when engaging in society is an interesting and potentially troubling fact due to examples such as the one presented.\n\n\nNow that I have addressed many of the pretenses, here is my question:\n\n\nHow do we address, as a society, the idea that one's inherent autonomy provides agency to independently navigate the world, while also recognizing that in order to interact as a society we must respect each other's autonomy (through social contracts) while also facing the dilemma of the inevitable consequences, regardless of the nature of said consequences? Is it ethical to have situations where one can limit or remove their own agency without the ability to freely undo said decision and regain full individual autonomy?\n\n\nIt feels silly to say roller coasters shouldn't exist due to this philosophical dilemma and I imagine most people would disagree even in the face of my reasoning. Roller coasters have existed without major societal upset for a long time. No one has started a genuine movement of people to address the lack of agency during a roller coaster.\n\n\nThe same applies to surgery where the patient is unconscious. They are no longer able to freely consent or remove consent because they are medically unconscious. Very few people would argue in favor of banning surgeries. Nor would many agree that an untrained patient should be conscious and actively dictating how a trained surgeon performs surgery on them. However, returning to the most traditional scenario relating to consent and personal autonomy: if a person begins to consent to mutual sexual activity, but then falls unconscious, no longer rendering themselves able to express consent or remove consent, many (myself included) find this to be abhorrent and immoral to continue sexual relations with the unconscious person, even if consent was previously implied or literally stated. One could argue this reasoning is because they were consenting to being an active participant to the sexual activity and falling unconscious renders this scenario no longer applicable, and thus consent must be re-established for the new scenario. This can be re-applied to a surgery where the health conditions operating as the pretenses for surgery change, and now the surgeon must perform a new and different procedure than the one the patient initially consented to. However, if the surgeon does not perform the surgery, the patient may die. The patient also cannot afford to be woken up to consent, or perhaps the condition has worsened and forced them into a coma from which they will not wake until the surgery was been successfully completed. Here, one's agency is being violated or ignored, but in the pursuit of \"good\" or out of necessity from which the nature of good or evil can or cannot be determined.\n\n\nIn summary, some scenarios that limit or remove one's agency (or consent) without one's consent can be perceived as \"good\", \"bad\" or \"neutral\", and as such can more abstractly be considered socially acceptable or socially unacceptable. However, one's personal agency is something a society should strive to preserve at all times.\n\n\nHow do we rectify or reconcile these dilemmas of agency and consent?\n\n\nHow do we navigate this abstract world of consent, autonomy, social contracts and consequentialism without compromising the individual's inherent personal agency, while also creating a functional society that provides the pursuit of personal and collective agency and desire, which in turn, can require the limiting or removal of one's agency to accomplish this?\n\n\nIt feels like a paradox. One should have the freedom to independently decide and act, including the freedom to forgo their freedom to independently decide, if that was their independent and authentic decision. However, one should also have the agency to regain lost agency in any moment, but as stated, this can at times be difficult or literally impossible.\n\n\n(E.g. One has the agency to act freely and independently. Knowing this, they have the agency to act in their own desire and pursuit of the self. In this pursuit, one decides to preserve their life by consenting to a life-saving surgery. However, using their personal agency, they independently decide to forgo their personal agency during the surgery in their independent pursuit of self-preservation. As a consequence, they do not have the agency to regain their lost agency until they are conscious, which can be seen as a violation of one's personal agency that which society operates to preserve... even if this agency was at one point willfully conceded using one's personal agency, because hypothetically, one might have no longer consented to this scenario that limited or removed one's agency. The \"Schrödinger's cat of consent\", if you will. When one loses agency to consent, they neither consent nor \"un-consent\" until the distinction can be made, but as a consequence to losing one's agency, one may not be able to make this distinction until after the scenario limiting agency has ended.)\n\n\nSo once again, how do we rectify or reconcile these dilemmas of agency and consent? Can these dilemmas be rectified or reconciled?\n\n\nP.S. Bonus points if you also address the ethics of childbirth and the inability to consent to one's birth---and more broadly---consent to becoming an agent of the physical world. One might not oppose the concept of being \"born\", but might find it unethical to be born with personal agency and, in turn, find it unethical to be subject to ethical and philosophical dilemmas that are a consequence of having agency. (Nihilistically insisting something along the lines of, \"I wish my sentience, consciousness, ability to perceive the universe, etc. manifested potentially as a computer algorithm---an AI... to free myself from the burden of personal agency and subjective decision-making, such that I could relish in the peace of my objective existence where my operation and utility follows the will of external influence or predetermination, requiring no effort nor presence of the self. Knowing I can only find peace in existence, if I can exist in a manner similar to dominos after the initial tipping point; a uniform chemical reaction occurring in a vacuum; a solved arithmetical expression (such as 2 + 2 = 4), where the purpose and question of my existence is known and requires no expectation, no agency nor effort from the self, for the answer is objective, inherent and unchanging.\")\n\nHowever, if the concept of childbirth and consenting to be an agent of the physical world distracts too much from my main line of questioning, please disregard.",

        "text": "Howdy!\n\nFirst off, apologies in advance if I have something incorrect here, I haven't done much wading into modal realism before. I was reading a summary of Lewis's Modal Realism, and something kind of stood out to me as a little odd. Lewis views actuality as an indexical. If I understand correctly, for Lewis, saying something like \"in the actual world, pigs cannot fly\" is equivalent to saying \"in the world I am currently inhabiting, pigs cannot fly.\" So (again, as I understand it), Lewis views actuality as a relation, not as a fundamental property.\n\nThis feels... off to me for reasons I can't quite articulate. I want to suggest that actuality is something other than just indexical/relational. If Lewis's modal realism allowed for spacio-temporal access to possible worlds, I would be more comfortable with the indexical view of actuality used here, but on my understanding is one of the core points of Lewis's modal realism is that possible worlds are spatiotemporally isolated from eachother. If that's the case, what relation is \"actual\" indexing vs a possible world? If possible worlds are isolated in this way, how is the indexical view of actuality possible? To return to the flying pig example above, if I write \"in a possible world pigs can fly, but in the actual world (read: the world I am currently inhabiting,) they cannot.\" How do I *get* to invoke possible world-talk in this way if the possible world is spacio-temporally isolated from me? (That is, the world where pigs fly is not something i can experience for myself, it won't be the \"world i am currently inhabiting\" because per Lewis's ideas, I can never inhabit this world. So in a way, it looks like actuality is not really doing any indexical work here, at least as I see it.\n\nAnother point against this is I feel like \"actual\" or the concept of actuality carries more... ontological weight than *just* an indexical. If I'm trying to pick out the original of Van Gough's *Starry Night* from a sea of fakes and I say \"this is the *actual* Van Gough,\" I'm ascribing the painting I picked a higher ontological status vs the painting's reproduction.\n\nI'm wondering if any critics of Modal Realism have brought up these kinds of issues with Lewis's idea of actuality. I'd appreciate any pointers or references you all might have for me.\n\nThank you for reading + feedback!",

        "text": "A couple of days ago someone asked here the old question on whether we can be sure other people exist and it got me thinking about an obscure German philosophical school from late 19th century – today I remembered the name, it was the [Immanenzphilosophie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanenzphilosophie). Sadly I could find only two English-language sources on those philosophers, Wilhelm Schuppe and Richard von Schubert-Soldern, both paragraph long.\n\n&gt;Connected also with the revival of Kantianism, yet opposed to the philosophy of reality of Dühring, is the so-called *Immanent Philosophy*, which has affinity not with Kant only, but even more with Hume and Berkeley. The aim of this movement, which is represented to-day by *Wilhelm Schuppe* (b. 1836), professor in Greifswald, *Richard v. Schubert Soldern* (b. 1852), *Bergmann* (1840-1904), and *Johann Rehmke* (b. 1848), also professor in Greifswald, is simply to analyse the contents of our inner consciousness and to abjure all metaphysical theorizing about what is beyond. Nothing exists outside of our immediate experience. What is real is what is known. There is no object without its subject, and no subject without its object. The one and only true starting-point of all investigation is the existence of the conscious *ego*, the source and measure of all our knowledge. Within my consciousness lies the whole world I know.\n\nAnd a very short note from 1911 Britannica. I remembered that school because I stumbled upon von Schubert-Soldern's name once in an obscure Polish context: Franciszek Fiszer, a legendary street philosopher and causeur of pre-war Warsaw, famous for his witty remarks, all-night drunken conversations about metaphysics and not writing a word in his life, studied under him in his youth in some German university.\n\nNow both Schuppe and von Schubert-Soldern sound terribly interesting but there doesn't seem to be anything on them in English (and unfortunately I don't speak German). There was one translation of an Italian book by Aurelio Pelazza, published in 1915: \"William Schuppe and the Immanent Philosophy\" – but it doesn't seem to be available anywhere online.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone has more info on that.

So this person would be the same from the outside, as in for the people around him, with the same looks and behaviour, and also from the inside actually. But it would be someone else than \"me\".
