        "text": "  I didn't realise until years later why my father had been trying to kill me so desperately when I was only eight years old.\n\nIn fact, I mostly forgot what had happened. Or at least, I tried to. \n\nOnce in a while, for no reason at all, a memory of his sudden hard push on the swing would come back to me, so vivid that I could feel his hands on my back, as strong and sharp as that day we were in the playground together. I remember how my tiny body was flung up high high high into the blue sky, higher than it had ever been, leaving the swing as gravity tugged my arms, swooping in an arc and then falling, tumbling by the green leaves and grass and sunlight. I remember thinking I had turned into a bird.\n\nThen the terrible thud as I hit the spongey playground gravel. \n\nThen I heard my dad calling me \"Are you ok? Jennie?\"\n\nI staggered to my feet. “I’m ok dad!” I called, not wanting him to feel upset. He had seemed upset recently. \n\nI saw the look in his eyes. I didn’t have the words for it then, but they were sparking angry. I knew he was hoping I couldn’t get up, but I was only eight, and I didn’t know what to do about that.\n\nOr, I remember that time when I was pedalling around on my first bike in our driveway. It was such a pretty shiny red colour, covered with Cinderella stickers- I loved it so much.  It must have been very soon after I fell from the swing. I looked up from, and saw our car backing in on me. \n\nI realised I’m going to be squished, just like the roadkill we saw when driving out of the city, like a squashed bloody pancake with fur sticking out. I flung myself off my bike. The car ran over my pretty red bike with a horrible crunching sound of metal, I could feel the whoosh of the tires as I lay on the driveway, barely five inches away. \n\n\"Jennie! Jennie! Are you ok?\" My dad rushed out of the car towards me, and paused when he saw the mangled bike while I got up. I saw that same look as when I fell from the swing- those burning angry eyes and then, I felt fear flicker deep in the pit of my stomach. I remember first feeling sad about my bike, but then more afraid than sad.\n\nAfter he tried to drown me in a crowded city swimming pool, I knew I had to do something. \n\nI didn’t understand why – he was generally a nice normal daddy, and he had promised me he would get a new red bike, just like the one he had accidentally crushed with our car. But then the swimming pool happened. \n\nMy and my dad had this little game in the shallow end - he would stand with his legs far apart, I would swim under the water and swim through his legs, and come up on the other side. I loved doing that- I could swim back and forth through his legs a hundred times! \n\nAnyway, I swam through once, came up to the surface laughing with happiness at accomplishing this, dove back down, peered through the blue stingy chlorinated water at his legs standing wide apart, went through, and he brought his legs sharply together, gripping my sides tightly, squeezing and squeezing. \n\nSometimes I wake up at night, sweating, remembering the feel of his legs pinning my sides, holding me down in the water. \n\nI scrabbled and pushed at his legs with my hands trying to make him let go of me, but when he didn’t I opened my mouth and bit him in the calf, sinking my sharp new teeth into his hairy flesh as deep as I could. He twitched and loosened his grip, and in that same instant I slipped out and up, gasping and spluttering. \n\nWe looked at each other through the bright blue pool waves. We didn’t say anything. I looked down, and I could see the dark trickle of blood by his legs. \n\nWe left the pool. \n\nI knew he wasn't going to leave it chance and accidents anymore. And I knew he was running out of time. \n\nI never found out the exact nature of the business my dad was in- but I knew he had to kill me because of his business. He was talking a lot, loudly into his laptop, “the project has to start” “we need the money” “luck is on our side” and then promising he would \"get it done\", and after the swimming pool I knew \"it\" meant killing me.\n\n“I understand” I heard him say. “I will. By the end of the week.” And I knew he meant I would be dead by the end of the week.\n\n“And you’ll hold up your end?” he asked into his laptop. “the investment…our project? Yes, yes, I know, I’m not doubting you.” \n\nYears later, I was studying Greek Myths at high school and learned about Agamemnon and what he did to his daughter and realised that was why my dad was trying to kill me. To win something. He had to kill me, to make his business work. But I had had to die first.\n\nI didn't die though- I was smarter than Daddy and I was able to kill him first before he could kill me. I still remember how I did it- it had been quite easy- just like in the cartoons. I had placed a couple of my dolls at the top of the stairs. He had tripped and fell. I picked up the iron from the laundry closet and ran down after him, where he lay winded and struggling to get up. Before he could, I smashed his head in. Then I ran back upstairs, carefully wiped the iron clean with toilet paper, flushed down the paper, and put the iron back in the closet.\n\nI honestly don’t remember much about what happened afterwards, just feeling good that no one was trying to kill me to make their business succeed.",

        "text": "I am Zhukov, a Siberian exploration scientist who has spent the majority of my career studying the depths of the earth. My team and I were on a mission to uncover the remains of the Kola Superdeep Borehole, a massive hole drilled by Soviet scientists in the 1970s in an attempt to reach the Earth's mantle. As we approached the site, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer size of the hole. It was a gaping abyss, seemingly bottomless.  \nWe went near the hole and were preparing ourselves to go down the hole. As we began our descent, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were venturing into the unknown. The walls of the hole were rough and jagged, and the air grew colder with each step. We had to be careful not to slip on the loose rocks and debris that littered the ground. As we reached the bottom, I couldn't believe my eyes. The borehole was still intact, and it was even deeper than we had initially thought.  \nI knew that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I couldn't pass up the chance to see what lay at the bottom of this hole. I decided to lower a camera down the borehole to see what secrets it held. The camera was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, allowing us to see deep into the earth's depths.  \nAs the camera descended, the images it transmitted back to us were beyond anything I could have imagined. The walls of the hole were made of solid rock, and the temperature was increasing with each foot it descended. But as the camera reached deeper depths, the images grew more and more disturbing. The walls of the hole began to warp and twist, and strange creatures started to appear on the camera's feed. They were unlike anything I had ever seen before. Their bodies were twisted and contorted, and their eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.  \nI couldn't believe what I was seeing, it was as if we were peering into the very depths of hell. The creatures were writhing and squirming, their mouths open in silent screams. I felt a sense of dread wash over me as I realized that we were not alone in this hole. We were in the presence of something truly terrifying.  \nI immediately ordered the camera to be pulled back up, but it was too late. The creatures had already latched onto the camera's cable, pulling it down into the depths of the hole. I watched in horror as the cable went taut, and then snapped, sending the camera crashing down into the abyss.  \nOne of the creatures managed to somehow climb up the cable before it snapped and attacked us. My colleague, Daniyel, got taken by the creature and pulled him down to the hellish area never to be seen again.  \nI immediately called the government on the incident and wanted the Kola Superdeep Borehole sealed with anything possible. The Borehole got sealed with a 400 meter depth concrete mixture with a tiny bit of uranium at the bottom to prevent creatures crawling up the hole.  \nThe expedition was over, and I knew that we could never go back down into the hole. It was a portal to the unknown, and I was not prepared to face the terror that lay at its bottom. The Kola Superdeep Borehole may have been a scientific triumph, but it was also a gateway to the unknown, and I was not willing to risk the lives of my team to explore it further.  \nFrom that day on, the Kola Superdeep Borehole became known as a place of mystery and terror, and nobody is allowed near it without government permission to do so. I could never shake the memory of the twisted creatures that I had seen on the camera's feed. The true terror of hell had been revealed to me, and I knew that I could never unsee it.",

        "text": "I have been alive for longer than you can imagine. I cannot die. I’ve tried, many times, but nothing can kill me. I’ve jumped off cliffs, crushed my head with rocks, one time I even sat in a volcano. I have outlived my friends and family, and even my entire species.\n\nAt first, it was exciting. I could go on adventures and experience things that nobody else could. But as time went on, the true horror of my existence dawned on me. I watched as the world around me changed, as civilizations rose and fell, and as the earth slowly decayed. I was the last human, the last being of any kind.\n\nAs the planet became uninhabitable, I wandered the barren landscape, searching for any signs of life. But there was nothing. There was only me, and the sand beneath my feet. I would remain alone for all eternity. I watched as the sun died, and the universe began to go cold and dark.\n\nIn my younger years, much like anyone, I learned of the heat death of the universe, the inevitable end of the universe. I thought that this end had finally come, that after aeons I would finally be able to die. But even as the stars let out their final rays one by one, I remained. I watched as galaxies collapsed, and the universe became nothing but a vast, cold, emptiness.\n\nBut even in the emptiness, I was unable still to die. I floated through the void, or perhaps I was immobile, without any light I was unable to tell. My thoughts were the only company I had. I thought about my life, about all the things I had seen, and experienced. I thought about the people I had loved, and lost.\n\nI could not even try to guess how long I’ve been there, in the dark, but after a long, long time, something miraculous happened. Another big bang occurred and a new universe began to expand once again. I could not believe it, but it was true. I watched as new stars and galaxies formed, and I knew that I would once again see the beauty of the universe.\n\nAs the new universe began to take shape, another earth formed, and yet again I experienced the rise and fall of many a civilization. I couldn't help but wonder if this cycle would continue forever. As you are reading this, I have lived through eleven big bangs.\n\nIf there was one thing I knew for certain, it was that free will as you know it is an illusion. Every cycle is the same. But now, because I posted this message, your life from now will be different. Just by you reading these words I have made an impact. But it will not matter.\n\nI will never know the peace of death, and I will be forced to watch as the universe continues to evolve and change, and end, and start again. I yearn for death, but it will never come. I am trapped in this existence, cursed to witness eternity.",

        "text": "Growing up in a 4-bedroom country house, I always believed it to be haunted. My siblings, being older, always tried to scare me with stories of Mrs. Maisel, who had died in the house and liked to abduct little misbehaving girls. As a young child, I believed every word and tried to be the best-behaving little girl in the house, so she would take my sister instead.\n\nBut as I got older, strange things began to happen in the house that my parents couldn't explain. Taps in the bathroom would turn on at night, the baby gate for our Yorkies would be opened at the top of the stairs, and I would be blamed for it all, as I was a sleepwalker. Everything seemed innocent enough until my sister, at the age of 10, claimed she was pushed down the stairs one night while going to the bathroom.\n\nAs a result, we moved into an apartment in the city, and the paranormal activity quieted down. But as I grew older and moved out, strange things began to happen again, and I was accused of doing things I knew couldn't be true. My mother would accuse me of leaving taps open and the fridge door open, but I had no memory of doing so.\n\nAs I began studying psychology, I found myself struggling to keep up with my classes and my relationships. I broke up with my first serious boyfriend, and I started going out more with friends, spending less time with my mother. It was during this time that she accused me of trying to kill her in her sleep. I knew I was innocent, but I felt gaslit and alone.\n\nI found a new apartment close to campus, but it was in poor condition and I had to spend a small fortune to make it livable. As I neared the end of my 4th year, I knew I had to repeat some subjects and find a second part-time job to cover the difference of my scholarship. I started bartending at night and being home at 3 am.\n\nBut even in my new apartment, strange things began to happen. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my bedroom door open and the smell of gas in the air. I knew I wasn't sleepwalking, but I couldn't explain it. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched, and I knew I had to uncover the truth about my past and my family's haunted house before it was too late.\n\nAs I begin to investigate the past events, I start to uncover dark secrets and conspiracies that threaten to destroy my family and the people I love. I must race against time to solve the mystery of the haunted house and the spirit of Mrs. Maisel before she can harm anyone else. But with every step closer to the truth, the danger grows more severe and I wonder if I will be able to survive the horrors that await me.\n\nAs I delved deeper into my investigation, I started to notice strange occurrences happening around me. I would see shadows moving on the wall when there was no one there, and I would hear whispers in my ear when I was alone. I began to suspect that the spirit of Mrs. Maisel was not the only entity haunting me, and that something else was at play.\n\nI consulted with a psychic, who told me that I was being possessed by a malevolent entity that had attached itself to my shadow. She explained that this entity had been following me since I was a child and had been feeding off my fear and anxiety. It had been manipulating me through my sleepwalking and causing the strange occurrences in my life.\n\nI was shocked and terrified by this revelation, but I knew I had to face my fear and confront the entity. I gathered all of my courage and performed a ritual to banish the entity from my shadow. The ritual was intense and draining, but it was successful. The entity was gone, and I felt a weight lifted off of my shoulders.\n\nBut as the entity left me, I realized that it had been possessing my shadow all along and it was the cause of all my problems. My sleepwalking, my accident with my sister and the other strange things that happened, it was all because of the entity. I felt a mix of relief and guilt, as I finally had answers, but it was also my own shadow that has been causing harm to my loved ones and myself.\n\nWith the entity gone, I finally felt free and at peace. I could finally put the past behind me and move forward with my life. But I knew that I would never forget the lessons I had learned and the struggles I had overcome. I would always carry the scars of my past with me, but they would only make me stronger.\n\nAs I delved deeper into my investigation, I started to notice strange occurrences happening around me.

I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my bedroom door open and the smell of gas in the air. I knew that the ritual hadn't worked and the entity was still with me.\n\nI felt a mix of disappointment and desperation as I realized that the ritual was only a temporary solution. The entity was still there, hiding in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike. I knew that I had to find a way to truly banish the entity and end its hold over me once and for all.\n\nWith a new sense of determination, I began to research different methods to get rid of the entity. I consulted with experts in the field of paranormal activity, and I poured over ancient texts to find a way to truly banish the entity from my shadow. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was determined to rid myself of the entity once and for all.",

        "text": "A loud honk sounded as the car in front of me came to a sudden stop. Something had dashed across the road. Something large.\n\nI slammed my foot down on the brakes and prayed the icy road wouldn’t allow yet another fender bender.\n\nIt was hard to make out any shapes through the thick veil of the blizzard’s harrowing symphony, but I could tell that whatever had crossed the highway had done so with speed and precision.\n\n“*Maybe a moose*?” I thought to myself, paying no further mind to the matter.\n\nI reclined into my seat and turned up the volume on the radio. Frank Sinatra’s “*I’ve got you under my skin*” filled the cozy insides of my SUV, and I felt my heart rate steadily stabilize.\n\nIt had been several hours since I left my hometown, and now I was surrounded by an endless expanse of white as far as the eye could see. There should have been a forest on either side of the highway, but with the severely deteriorating weather conditions, it was impossible to make out anything farther than six feet away.\n\nAs I tapped my fingers on the steering wheel in perfect synchronization with the song, I grew more and more impatient. We had stood still for at least five minutes now. Surely, there couldn’t be this much traffic all the way out here?\n\nThe song was nearly over and we still hadn’t moved. Behind me, I could hear a chorus of aggressive honking.\n\nThere were at least six cars behind me, and as far as I could tell, probably six in front as well. Their headlights were the only indicator of their existence, as the snow had turned everything else invisible.\n\nThen a grizzly thought spread like wildfire throughout the crevices of my mind; had there been an accident?\n\nI sat up in my seat and made an attempt to somehow peek above the top of the car ahead of me. It was futile.\n\n“*What is going on?”* I murmured under my breath as a loud sigh escaped my body.\n\nThe howling winds outside violently slammed into the exterior of the car, killing any notions that I may have had about stepping out and investigating.\n\nFor now, It was best I just waited it out. It would surely pass in a minute or so.\n\nI picked up my phone and started messing around with a few apps. I do not condone texting and driving, but considering we hadn’t been moving for a while, I’d wager a short social media session couldn’t hurt anyone.\n\nAnd besides, it didn’t look like I was going anywhere anytime soon either. I even glanced over to the half-empty bottle of Jack Daniel’s that laid unassuming on the floorboard of the seat beside me, but I decided against it for now.\n\nPrior to this traffic jam, I had been visiting my extended family for the holidays back in my hometown.\n\nDue to reasons we don’t need to delve into, I was forced to leave earlier than I’d initially expected. Which was fine by me as I couldn’t stand another second of chatty family drama and that awful holiday cheer.\n\nForgive me if I’m sparse with the details, but for privacy’s sake, I won’t disclose the name of the town I departed from, nor where I am currently headed.\n\nAll you need to know is that the road I was traveling on was located pretty far up in the northwestern region of the United States, and it was absolutely freezing.\n\nSome time passed, and the vehicles on the road hadn’t moved an inch, it was as though they were rooted to the icy foundations below.\n\nDauntingly, I observed as the car in front of me was in the process of getting devoured by the rapidly growing snowfall.\n\nIts tires were nearly completely engulfed, and I figured that it wouldn’t be long until getting home in time to watch today’s football game would be the least of my concerns.\n\nThen, growing in the distance, were sirens. I looked up from my phone and directed my gaze toward the side-view mirror and saw a faint blinking blue light penetrate through the thicket of snow.\n\nThe ambulance zoomed past me at breakneck speeds, and shortly after, a police car followed.\n\nThis only reaffirmed my belief that something terribly wrong had occurred. I scrolled through my phone and continued as usual, though my digital endeavors would prove to be quite fruitless.\n\nThe longer I used my phone, the worse the connection seemed to get. TikTok and YouTube videos began buffering, and other apps that required internet connectivity wouldn’t even load.\n\nI’m by no means a physicist, tech guru, meteorologist, or whatever the appropriate title for this would be, but I surmised that the ongoing raging storm could be linked to the shortcomings of my phone signal.\n\nIncidentally, I was also in the middle of nowhere, forty minutes away from the nearest settlement, and three hours away from the closest city. The remoteness of my location would surely also have an impact on my…\n\nA light tapping on the window caught me off-guard and I jolted in my seat.\n\n“*Crap!”* I thought, as the sight of a bulky police officer greeted me on the other side of the glass. By the looks of it, he had been out in the storm for way too long. His cheeks were glowing pink, and he had snowflakes stuck in his burly mustache.\n\nI quickly stowed my phone in my pocket and rolled down the window, preparing to explain why I was on my phone in traffic.\n\nBut the officer didn’t care about any of that.\n\n“*Good evening, sir.”* The officer started. *“There has been an incident further up the road, right now we’re trying to…- Could you turn that down?”* He gestured toward the radio.\n\n*“Uh, sorry officer, of course!”* I replied, dialing the scroll wheel of the volume button all the way down.\n\n“*As I was saying, we’re trying to evacuate this, uh, whole area. Once I’ve gotten to the final car at the end behind you there, and I’ve gotten him to start backing up, I want you to follow him immediately.”*\n\n*“You want me to drive in…reverse?”* I questioned, a quizzical grimace stretched across my face.\n\n“Road’s too narrow. *Right now, I don’t see any other option… Unless you wanna try turning around and risk ending up in one of these ditches here”.* The officer said with a slight smirk.\n\nBut before I had the chance to say anything else, a thundering bang sounded a couple of yards in front of us. The winds carried the sound with earsplitting accuracy.\n\nThe officer reacted immediately, hovering his hand above the pistol in his holster. He took a few steps back and tried signaling in on his shoulder-mounted radio.\n\nAnother bang echoed through the harsh wind, followed by another. Then another. The sounds were unmistakable. They were gunshots.\n\nHe drew his pistol and rushed toward the source of the sounds.\n\nI watched as he slowly faded from view. A void of white had swallowed him whole…\n\nI stared in shock for a couple of minutes, expecting the officer to return any moment, but he never came.\n\nA small mass of snow had started accumulating inside my car, so I quickly rolled up the window.\n\nI could hear another set of muffled gunshots joining the already dominant ones. It sounded like they were completely emptying their magazines into whoever or whatever!\n\nThen, in perfect unity, the sounds stopped.\n\nThe silence weighed heavy as I sat in anticipation. My mind was flustered with thoughts and ideas, but the prevalent feeling that occupied my body was a creeping sensation of dread.\n\nJust what the hell was going on?\n\nI anxiously tapped my fingers on the steering wheel. In a moment of weakness, I once again looked over to the liquor bottle on the floor. I hadn’t gone this long without a drink in years.\n\nOne sip wouldn’t hurt, right? Just to calm my nerves. If I was discreet enough, the officers would have no way of knowing.\n\nJust as I leaned over to the passenger side to pick the bottle up, my vehicle violently trembled. Something powerful had slammed into my car.\n\nI cursed loudly and rose back up, abandoning the bottle.\n\nI frantically searched around, looking for any signs of the perpetrator. I scanned my rear view, the side window, and even the passenger side’s window.\n\nNothing but a flurry of white specks.\n\nThen I noticed something in the blizzard in front of me. A black silhouette grew larger and larger, and soon I could make out what it was.\n\nA man, no, two men. And they were… running. Running towards my car. But these guys weren’t police officers, nor any of the paramedics that had arrived earlier. They must have been the denizens of the cars in front.\n\nAnd then, two more people appeared behind them, either giving chase to or following the two men in front.\n\nAs they inched closer, I could properly see the expressions carved into their faces. They were terrified. They looked as though they had seen a ghost.\n\nThe first two men ran past my car. They didn’t even look at me. Shortly after, the two people behind them followed, a woman and a boy. They hurried across the ice at great speeds while at the same time exercising caution so as to not slip and fall.\n\nBefore I had the chance to react, they were gone, having once again been consumed by the endless white void.\n\nThis was definitely cause for concern. Who in their right mind would abandon the comforts of their vehicles all the way out here? In this weather?\n\nThe driver in front of me cautiously opened one of the doors of the car. A middle-aged white man with a beer gut stepped out into the cold. He slung his puffer jacket around his shoulders and stared off into the distance ahead.\n\nI watched him curiously, wondering if he too would start running. And then wondering whether I should join him if he indeed decided to.\n\nRight now, It seemed illogical, but then again, these guys clearly knew something I didn’t.\n\n*“Maybe there was a gas leak ahead?”*\n\n*“Maybe some radioactive material had been improperly disposed of?”*\n\nMy mind raced, looking for any logical explanations for my current predicament, but I found none.\n\nThe man took a few steps forward, intently inspecting the blizzard ahead. It seemed as though something had caught his attention.\n\nHe took another few steps forward, positioning himself in front of his car, partially obscuring my view of him, his left side still visible.\n\nBut there was something else. In the deep recesses of the snowstorm, something was moving.\n\nI strained my eyes, leaning forward in my seat and staring through my snow-covered windshield.\n\nApproaching from the left side of the road onto the oncoming lane, a large silhouette bobbed up and down as it slowly advanced toward the man. Though it was far away, it looked to be near twice his height.\n\nBut he hadn’t noticed it.\n\nThe man was far too busy examining whatever had caught his attention directly in front of him.\n\nAn overwhelming sense of dread filled my veins.\n\nThe way the silhouette moved, I couldn’t quite explain why, but it felt predatory. Like a lion stalking its prey through the thick underbrush of the African savannah, right before springing into action and securing itself a fresh meal.\n\nWas it a moose? It didn’t look to be. The proportions were way off, and it almost looked to be bipedal. But I couldn’t think of any other large animals out here that the silhouette could have belonged to. I doubted this area had ever seen any polar bears. And even so, they couldn’t possibly reach this size, could they?\n\nIt was like my primal instincts screamed at me to do something. I felt my fight or flight start to kick in, but I managed to keep it under wraps.\n\nI was safe inside my warm SUV.\n\nBut the man, however. I had to warn him, somehow.\n\nIf I honked my horn, whatever was stalking him might have leaped into action right away. It was too risky.\n\nBefore I could think of anything, the man screamed in terror. Muffled through my car’s thick exterior, his cries echoed.\n\nI focused ahead of me, trying to get a glimpse of what had riled him up so badly.\n\nHe turned around in an attempt to flee. He had almost made it back to the driver’s side door of his car when he planted his face into the cold, hard ground. He must have slipped.\n\nThe predatory silhouette to his left was nowhere to be seen now.\n\nFor a brief moment, I locked eyes with the man. A familiar look of excruciating fear contoured across his face.\n\nHe dug his long and unkept nails into the snow, slowly crawling forwards.\n\nAnd then he screamed yet again. But this time, not out of fear, but in pain.\n\nViolently, he was dragged back. I watched in horror as the man tried to fight it, clutching the powdery snow as if it would actually provide a stable grip.\n\nHe was dragged in front of his car, and out of my view. Just before he rounded the left-side corner, I could see his blood-covered hands desperately cling to the tire, and then he was pulled away.\n\nI was in complete disbelief, It was like a scene from a horror movie, except this was real. This was actually happening.\n\nThe man’s wailing abruptly ceased, and besides the harsh winds of the blizzard, no sound was made.\n\nI pulled out my phone and tried my best to shake the trembling in my hands as I dialed 911.\n\nAs I waited for a response, I made sure all the doors were locked while I glued my eyes to the spot where I’d last seen the man.\n\nA pair of long indentations scarred the snow where he had lay, and a crimson handprint stained the black rubber of the front tire.\n\n“*Come on, come on! Pick up already!”* I harshly muttered to my phone.\n\nBut I never made it past the dialing tone. Was it because I had no service?\n\nI’ve heard that many emergency lines still operate in spite of a poor phone signal, but right now I was inclined to believe the contrary.\n\nI eventually gave up and put my phone down.\n\nI shrunk down into my seat, making myself as small as I could.\n\nI couldn’t possibly tell you how long I sat there, waiting like that. The concept of time felt irrelevant at that moment.\n\nIn my reclined position, I still retained a decent line of sight to the outside world. There were no signs of movement, just an empty white canvas. I could hear no discernable sounds either.\n\nI watched in what felt like slow-motion as each individually unique flake of snow landed, and then proceeded to melt onto the glass.\n\nThe windshield wipers fought the blizzard vigorously, brushing aside everything the malevolent storm had to offer.\n\nThen suddenly, with a squelched thud, something heavy crashed down on the window, and the wipers were now smearing a viscous red liquid back and forth across the windshield.\n\nA nearly indescribable sense of paralyzing horror drilled into my very soul as I realized what I was looking at.\n\nI immediately recognized the sorrowed eyes and contorted expression of pain that draped across the poor man’s face.\n\nGlistening red blood had completely dyed his hair, and the man’s skin was full of lacerations and tears.\n\nBut the true horror of this scene lay not with the frightful sight that greeted me no more than twelve inches away, separated only by a cracked glass screen.\n\nNo, the true horror presented itself after I finally mustered up the courage to ponder the question that I’m not even sure I wanted the answer to;\n\n“*Where was the rest of him?”*\n\nUpon the revelation that I was gazing at a freshly decapitated human head, I was compelled to scream uncontrollably at the top of my lungs, and so I did. I couldn’t help it. I felt nauseous and on the verge of vomiting.\n\nIt took all my strength to gather any fragment of composure that had not yet left my body, and I quickly sat up in my seat, frantically scanning my surroundings.\n\nStill, I saw nothing except a heavy downpour of snow.\n\nI tried to calm down, as I knew that panicking would only worsen whatever situation was at hand.\n\nI steadied my breathing and sat still. Slowly counting down from ten. However, the grotesque sight that greeted me whenever I looked through the windshield didn’t exactly help.\n\nSo I closed my eyes and continued counting, focusing on controlling my breathing.\n\n*“Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale…”*\n\nBut even as I closed my eyes, I still saw his face. The gruesome image had burned itself deep into my mind, and I felt anxious at the thought that I may never sleep peacefully again.\n\nIn my distracted haze, I failed to notice that something foreign had filled the air. Something ominous.\n\nIt was a deep sound, barely audible, a stark contrast to the roaring winds outside.\n\nIt was the kind of sound you feel rather than hear if that makes sense. It was deep and bellowing, and I swear I could feel my chest faintly vibrate. Like when you’re at a concert or nightclub with a really loud bass.\n\nCarefully, I rolled down my window a quarter of the way in order to better hear the curious noise.\n\nIt was much clearer now, and the best way to describe it would be to call it a sort of low-pitched rumble. Its tone fluctuated ever so slightly, as if in synchronization with short, rapid breaths. It would be a rather powerful display of vocal cords if the sound was of organic origin.\n\nI tried my best to pinpoint the direction from which the sound emanated, but I found the task to be near impossible.\n\nIt may have been the wind distorting and dislocating the sound, but It sounded like it originated from every direction.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. Obviously, I didn’t want to exit the car and make a run for it like the previous motorists before me, but I felt that staying inside the car would only render me a sitting duck.\n\nI had no weapons to protect myself either, not even a pocket knife in the glove compartment. The only thing I had was an old zippo lighter, which I doubted would do any real damage in a fight.\n\nThe deep rumbling subsided and was instead replaced by a hooting sound, reminiscent of that of an owl, only much deeper. Like if someone blew air into a hollow tree trunk. But this sound was easy to pinpoint, and I could discern that it was coming from behind the car in front of me, where I had last seen the man before his untimely demise.\n\nI fixed my gaze toward the source of the sound, expecting to see its owner peeking around the edges of the vehicle at any moment when I suddenly heard another, identical set of deep hooting coming from my left side.\n\nI wondered how the animal, or creature, or whatever it was that made those sounds, had somehow managed to sneak past my line of sight and position itself to my left without me noticing.\n\nBut my wondering was cut short when the original set of hoots in front once again started bellowing through the winter air, as if in response to the other ones.\n\nAnd to my utter dismay, I slowly began to realize that whatever was making those sounds, whatever had killed that man, was not alone out here.\n\nAnd that’s when I first saw it. As if on cue, I noticed the dominant silhouette standing in the middle of the road, contrasting itself against the rushing snowfall.\n\nSlowly emerging from the harrowing blizzard, just a few yards away from the car ahead, the creature revealed itself.\n\nIt was unlike anything I had ever seen before, an abominable middle finger to all of God’s creations upon this earth.\n\nIts skull resembled that of a crocodile, resting well over ten feet above the ground. It also had a large crest fixated right over its eyes, reminiscent of the horns of a bull. Its razor-sharp teeth were stained red, and blood dripped down from its maw and onto the snow-covered asphalt.\n\nThe entire creature was covered in dense, white fur, like that of a polar bear. No wonder I hadn’t spotted it until now, it was perfectly camouflaged among the powdery white snow.\n\nThe rest of the body was hard to make out due to the storm, but I could tell it was huge, easily towering over the vehicle it slowly approached.\n\nIt moved closer, trotting towards me in a jagged fashion. Blood still dripped from its malformed mouth. It almost looked to be smiling. Almost.\n\nI looked around the cabin of the car, once more desperately scouring for anything I could use to defend myself. Except for the bottle of liquor I had laying about, I was at a loss. At least I could ease the pain of being torn limb from limb by having a little alcohol in my system, I thought to myself.\n\nSeeing the creature uncomfortably close now, I made an attempt to just drive away.\n\nIt was true what the officer had said previously about the road being extremely narrow, but in the face of certain death, I figured it was worth a shot.\n\nThough, as I was boxed in by both a car in my front and one in my rear, I would have to succeed at a difficult maneuver in order to make my escape. A maneuver I wasn’t too sure I could make in these perilous conditions. But I had to try!\n\nI applied my foot down onto the gas pedal, and the tires spun around in the snow, slinging bits of debris everywhere.\n\nStill stationary, I pressed down even harder, hoping to God that I would break free from my frozen constraints.\n\nIn my panic, I gazed ahead and locked eyes with the creature. I could feel its wicked stare burrow deep into my soul.\n\nThe wheels kept spinning, but I wasn’t making any progress. I had waited too long. It was as I had feared earlier. I was trapped, there was nowhere to go.\n\nAn earsplitting hoot sounded just a few yards away, and I saw the creature had stopped in its tracks. It raised its head and let out another hoot.\n\n“*What the hell do you want!?”* I sobbed, punching the steering wheel in frustration.\n\nThe wretched thing cocked its head, and let out yet another vocalization. It was as if it wanted to grab my attention.\n\nOr to distract me…\n\nBefore I knew it, I felt a searing pain aching throughout my body and my world was turned upside down as a powerful force slammed into the left side of the car, sending it flying.\n\nThe SUV toppled over, accompanied by the sounds of crushing metal.\n\nThankfully I was wearing my seatbelt, or else I would have probably broken my neck while tumbling around inside the car like dirty laundry in a washing machine.\n\nWhen the car eventually came to a stop, I found myself suspended upside down in the driver’s seat. The vehicle had rolled down into the nearby ditch on the side of the road.\n\nBelow me, on the inside of the car’s roof, were fragments of shattered glass and heaps of snow.\n\nI hadn’t quite processed what had happened, so I sat there for a moment, taking it all in. Suddenly, everything felt so calm and quiet. I questioned if I had even survived the ordeal.\n\nA warm liquid flowed down from my chin, into my mouth, and then down the rest of my face. The stinging copper taste made me snap out of my trance, and I began to assess the situation.\n\nOutside I heard heavy thuds rapidly approaching the vehicle. Each mighty stomp struck down into the snow with rhythm, and I could imagine the creature’s mouth practically foaming at the prospect of a fresh new meal.\n\nThe footsteps came to a sudden halt right outside the driver’s side window, and I turned my head to get a better look.\n\nA set of two large and powerful hind legs stood mere inches away from my face. They were covered in what looked to be reptilian-like scales lined with dense white fur, and the creature had three long talons that protruded from each foot.\n\nThe deafening scraping of metal filled the air as I imagine the creature began clawing away at the undercarriage of the SUV.\n\nFrom the fast-paced shifting of the monster’s feet, I began to understand the sheer ferocity with which it attacked.\n\nIt was going ballistic, shredding the exterior at an incredibly fast rate.\n\nA combination of hoots and growls escaped its bloodthirsty jaws as it chipped away at the metal.\n\nIt wouldn’t be long until it was through.\n\nAnother pair of heavy footsteps stopped just a short distance away on the opposite side of the car, right outside the passenger’s side window.\n\nLike its predecessor, it too began clawing and kicking at the body of the car.\n\nThe two creatures were relentless, I’d never seen anything like it. Not even wild hyenas were this ravenous.\n\nI braced for impact as I unbuckled my seatbelt, positioning myself in such a manner so that I wouldn’t break my neck upon impact.\n\nI hit the ground hard and was greeted by the sensation of cold snow and broken glass.\n\nThe car rocked back and forth as the creatures violently attacked.\n\nIt was obvious I couldn’t stay in here for long, but escaping the crushed remains of my vehicle and running out on foot didn’t seem favorable either.\n\nI felt a deep desperation begin to set in as I realized I would most likely not live to see another day. This was it.\n\nJust as all hope had faded, and I began to accept my fate, my arm brushed up against a cold and oblong object.\n\nI shifted my body around to see what it was, and a lightbulb ignited inside my head as I gazed upon the still-intact bottle of liquor that laid on the floor.\n\nMy hands trembled as I reached deep into my pocket and extracted my old Zippo lighter.\n\nHowever, I examined the Jack Daniel’s and gauged that the contents inside would not be enough for the powerful reaction I was hoping for, so I opened the glove compartment and began searching.\n\n*“Ah, there it is!”*\n\nI cheered as my fingers grazed upon the bottle of scented hand sanitizer. An old relic from the pandemic. It was nearly full as well.\n\nI opened the two bottles and began pouring the disinfectant alcohol down into the half-empty liquor bottle.\n\nThe sanitizer mixed in with the strong bourbon would surely be enough for an improvised molotov cocktail.\n\nI ripped off a piece of cloth from my shirt and stuffed it down the bottleneck.\n\nWith the Molotov in hand, I crawled toward the cracked windshield. I spun around and pressed my feet against the shattered glass frame.\n\nIn an adrenaline-infused state, I pressed my legs down and applied pressure to the windshield.\n\nI strained my body and pushed my legs harder than I’d ever done before in my life, wishing I’d spent more time at the gym prior to this.\n\nDue to its severely damaged condition, it didn’t take long before the windshield came off, and the harsh winds of the outside world filled the cabin of the upside-down car.\n\nAbove me, the creatures growled and bellowed, ripping and tearing away at the framework. I could see narrow slivers of light begin to penetrate the underside of the car, meaning they were nearly through.\n\nI crawled through the new opening and out into the unforgiving blizzard.\n\nI feared that as soon as I stepped outside, one of the creatures would promptly place my head in its jaws and I would be done for, but that never came.\n\nIt seemed that they were too preoccupied with getting through the hard exterior of the SUV, and they had failed to notice that I had made my crafty escape.\n\nI kept crawling along the snow, praying to God that the beasts wouldn’t turn their hideous heads and discover the easy meal slithering away right beside it.\n\nI didn’t dare look back either. I couldn’t bring myself to face the abominable animals.\n\nOnce I had achieved a satisfactory distance away from the car, I finally turned around and rose to my feet.\n\nI ignited my lighter and set the molotov cocktail ablaze. Don’t try this at home by the way!\n\nWith all my remaining strength, I hurled the flaming bottle at the heap of scrap metal that used to be my car and watched in glory as the fire began to rise.\n\nI even think I hit one of the creatures, as I heard a dazzled yelp cry out.\n\nThe flames weren’t nearly big enough to cause a massive explosion or anything, but it was just enough to distract the creatures so that I was able to make a run for it.\n\nI ran back onto the road and continued past all the vacant cars that stood further up. The ice was painted red, and a couple of human corpses, or at least what remained of them, were strung about the various abandoned vehicles.\n\nEventually, I came upon the ambulance and the police car that had arrived about an hour prior. There were no signs of the officer who had talked to me, but deep down I knew what kind of fate had befallen him.\n\nIn the distance, I heard ominous rumbling sounds coming from one of the creatures, followed by agitated hooting. Had they finally noticed I was gone? In that case, I didn’t have a lot of time.\n\nI got inside the ambulance and planted myself down in the driver’s seat. A frozen and severed human hand was attached to the steering wheel. I gagged as I ripped it off and tossed it out the open window.\n\nThe creature’s shrill cries echoed through the snowstorm, and it sounded like they were coming closer.\n\nDesperately, I turned the ambulance’s ignition, and to my delight, it started up without a hitch.\n\nI kicked my foot down on the gas pedal and floored it out of there. Luckily for me, ambulances in this part of the United States come well equipped to handle hazardous terrain and snow-covered roads.\n\nAs I drove, I intently watched the rear-view mirror hoping I would get a last glimpse of one of the monsters, but the only things I saw were whirling snowflakes, dancing effortlessly along the icy winds that carried them.\n\nAbout thirty minutes of driving later, I arrived at a small town.\n\nThe blizzard had begun to let up, and the sun was starting to set on the horizon.\n\nI parked outside the first roadside hotel I found, and must have looked like a zombie as I frantically begged the receptionist to alert the authorities.\n\nShe looked extremely nervous but did as I told her.\n\nAfter a while of talking, the kind receptionist informed me that the police would stop by first thing tomorrow morning.\n\nApparently, the nearest police station was an hour’s drive away, and the raging storm had caused major problems across infrastructure all over the state.\n\nSeeing as how nobody was in immediate danger, they would wait until the roads were cleared and traversal was safe again.\n\nI wasn’t happy with this response, but I was too tired to really care. I checked into one of the hotel rooms and began typing all this out on my phone.\n\nThere are still so many questions left unanswered, but I imagine tomorrow will bring more news about the situation. I just hope that the other motorists along that highway made it out okay, but I have my doubts.\n\nThe blizzard has now subsided, and outside my second-story window, I am treated to a view of the clear night sky and the endless expanse of the tundra.\n\nI’ll admit, this landscape is beautiful, Though It is a shame that I will now forever associate the tranquility of snowfall with the abhorrent horror of events prior.\n\nHowever, that is not all…\n\nSince it was getting hot in my room, I decided to crack my window slightly ajar.\n\nFor the past hour, I have been listening to the breeze floating across the frozen countryside. There are no sounds of wild animals out here, oddly enough, but there is something else.\n\nOccasionally, in the distance, the silence is broken by the ever so familiar and foreboding sound of a faint hoot crying out into the night…",

        "author": "RafrafMakesShit",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10hrhvn/grandpas_farm_rules/",
        "text": "“Welcome to grandpa's farm, You can enjoy playing with the animals or help grandpa with chores. You can play around and have fun during day time but you must follow his rules after the sun sets. Here are the list of rules you MUST follow.\n\n1. Lock all doors and windows. Don't forget to close and barricade the main door, it must be locked shut or IT might get in. Don't forget to set up bear traps outside and in the house.\n\n2. Go to sleep before 8 or 9 pm. make sure to lock and barricade your door, no matter what you do or hear do not go out until sunrise. This rule is for kids only, If you are 13 years old or above, You must follow the next rules.\n\n3. Don't open any doors or let anyone in. If you hear someone asking for help DO NOT LET THEM IN, They are either getting attacked by IT or it's using them as bait. IT can mimic the voice of IT's victims, It can also change the form, It can take a form of a human or your dog. Forget about your dog, forget about the animals, If they're unlucky to be chosen as food then you can always replace them.\n\n4. Get ready for defense. If it somehow breaks in prepare to fight, You can use the pitchfork and spade for defense only, grandpa will be using the shotgun. What we're dealing with is no ordinary creature, no matter what you do, do not attack it first, It's best to wait for it to attack or choose its prey. If it finally chose who to eat, prepare to fight, It won't fight anyone else but its prey so others can attack it without it fighting back, If you're chosen then you must be prepared to defend yourself. If we hurt it enough it will run away, We can only scare it away for a while but we can't kill it, It will always come back. If we're lucky enough that it didn't choose anyone, Barricade the doors again, It might change its mind.\n\n5. Stay awake. You must stay awake until sunrise, Drinking energy juice or coffee can help. Don't be relieved that it's away, Even if we scared it away it might come back for revenge.\n\n6. Clean up. clean all the mess that was made by IT, Throw all dead bodies away and leave no evidence of IT attacking anyone, The children must not see them, It's better if they don't know about IT until they're old enough.\n\n7. Don't ask about IT. Don't tell anyone about IT, Don't go to the woods and search for IT, And most importantly, Don't ask grandpa about it. when you're old enough grandpa will tell you about it, He’ll only tell you what IT does and what to do, and after that, he won't answer any questions about IT and he will be upset if you ask about IT. They say It lives near the woods but comes hunting for food in farms and houses, they also say IT doesn't belong to this world and IT was somehow related to grandpa, They also say grandpa feeds IT But it's all just rumors from people who know about IT.\n\nThat's all the rules you must follow at grandpa’s farm, Make sure to follow them if you want to stay alive. Good luck. -love, Gary”\n\nGary wrote me this letter years ago for I’ll be helping grandpa while he's away, I don't know what to tell him if he finds grandpas dead body. I can't help it, I can't do it anymore, I can't keep on pretending to be his little nephew, I've stayed with grandpa for so long that I almost forgot what I am. I wanted to get inside his house so I disguised myself as his nephew, But this man was so kind I fell in love with him, They treated me like nobody has before, they treated me with love and kindness unlike those of my kind, but I couldn't stay long, I have to eat proper food and human food won't help, So slowly I ate all grandpas animals, and eventually, they ran out, I can't help it, I have to eat more. Good thing Gary's family came over, I ate them inside the house, and Grandpa saw, He was terrified so I had to kill him too. But I can't go, I have to stay, I don't want to go back to my kind and be treated like a dog. So I will wait for him, I'll wait for Gary to come home and he can take care of me, I can go to his farm and feed on his animals too, I just need to do everything to stay with them, Ill do everything even if it means I’ll eat human food.\n\nHe's back. I told him someone ate them, He took me to a house, but it was no good, There were no animals, Nothing but weird stuff, I stayed there for a month but I couldn't stay longer. I decided to eat them and finally go back to my kind, Now I have to prepare, my kind will be very disappointed and they will torture me until I learn my lesson.",

        "text": "I stopped believing in hope when a jiggly, greasy Santa Claus leaned in front of the popped eyeball goop dripping down my face, his lumpy erection bumping against the two remaining gifts, as the barbecue smell wafted from my friend’s sizzling corpse while it melted onto my thighs. The stranger I only knew as “brunette college girl” sobbed quietly and shook her head, unable to articulate her pain and horror within the confines of the English language. \n\n“[I said that it was *your turn*](https://redd.it/10bpzvo),” Dirty Santa grunted. He ground his teeth back and forth. It sounded like an ungreased axle scraping the paint off a car’s hood.\n\n‘Please don’t,’ she mouthed without sound.\n\n“Did you know that I can cut pieces of your face off, then stitch them back in the wrong spots?” Santa reached for his sphincter and smiled. “Even if you make that course of action a necessity, you’ll still have to choose a gift afterward.”\n\nShe shook her head, tears streaming and snot jiggling, as she reached a trembling hand for a red bag with a festive red bow.\n\nSanta licked his lips. Dry skin snowed down like dandruff.\n\nI silently begged her not to pick the red bag.\n\nShe hesitated.\n\nAnd then she picked the red bag.\n\nThe young woman reached in and extracted a trembling hand, holding a pistol with a tag attached to it. It was a bizarre juxtaposition; she was short and slight, clutching a weapon that was clearly designed for a much larger person. Her eyes were wide, and she was too afraid to let go of what she held. \n\nThe blonde woman next to her read the tag aloud:\n\n“You found Santa’s best gift,\n\nyou sly little elf!\n\nPick one person to shoot,\n\nYes, even yourself!”\n\nThe young woman held the gun as far from her face as she possibly could. It looked like she was squeezing a particularly old slice of mayonnaise custard. But she didn’t release it; the weapon stuck to her fingers like an electrical current was keeping her grip shut tight.\n\n“I’d like to switch my gift,” the blonde woman said.\n\n“Hmmmm?” Santa asked, smiling toward her. “But you haven’t even picked yet!”\n\n“Doesn’t matter,” she shot back. “I want hers.”\n\nSanta sniffed his finger before reaching behind himself once more. “Well… why don’t you *take* it, then?”\n\nThe younger woman looked at her with pleading eyes. I could have sworn that she just wanted a parent figure in that moment.\n\n“Hand it to me,” the blonde woman said, nodding. “I promise it will be okay.”\n\nThe gun shook.\n\nThen the college girl dropped the weapon in the other woman’s extended hand, snapping her arm back as though she’d been burned. \n\nThe blonde woman gave a sad smile. Her younger counterpart leaned back, relief washed over her face. \n\nThe blonde woman turned the pistol at the college girl and shot her. \n\nHeadshots are glamorous in every movie you’ve seen. The hero executes with perfect, clean aim to eliminate someone whom we accept as a ‘bad guy.’ Superfluous characters are rarely considered after their demise, and we never wonder how their mothers react upon hearing that the funeral will need to feature a closed casket.\n\nI had no such luxury. The human head contains no empty space, and when her blood and brains had blown onto the floor, my mind boggled at how it all fit to begin with. \n\nHer eyes stuck with me the most. They bulged, twitched, and blinked long after brain function had ceased.\n\n“Gorgeous,” Santa breathed. “A sight that would give 19 erections to 13 dandelions.” He was three fingers deep at this point. “But what to do now?” His nostrils flared. “No one is left to choose the final present!” He looked at me with shaky pupils. “Our gift exchange has ended early. Oh well, it was fun!”\n\nThen he turned and skipped – no shitting, he actually *skipped* - toward the only door in the room.\n\n“Wait,” the blonde woman called after him. “If it’s over, can we go home? Can we leave?”\n\n“Oh, I taped Exacto knives and your fully-charged cellphones beneath each of your chairs. They’ve been there the whole time, and you have more than enough slack to reach them even with your hands tied. Isn’t it funny that you could have escaped without hurting yourselves?” \n\nThen he farted and hopped out the door.\n\nThe blonde woman’s face blanched as she froze for just a moment. \n\nThen she reached under her seat, moving furiously. Five seconds later, she emerged with the knife and cell phone, then began working to free herself. She locked eyes with me, panting.\n\nI hadn’t budged.\n\nUsing quick movements, she shredded the twine holding her in place. With that out of the way, she stood, flexed her fingers, and pocketed the phone. Then she took the Exacto knife in her left hand and the pistol in her right, turned around, and advanced on me.\n\nI still hadn’t moved. I was spiritually empty. \n\n“We’re built to survive,” she whispered. “And secrets are meant to be kept.” She looked down at the weapons she held.\n\nOnly then did I understand.\n\n“There’s no good way out of this,” she whispered. “I’m sorry, my friend – but not sorry enough to stop myself.”\n\nMy blood ran cold. I knew that there was a knife just below me, and I knew I’d be dead before reaching it. \n\nI cried out of my remaining eye. \n\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered once more. “But I just checked, and there’s only one bullet left, which I’ll need to keep for an emergency.” She lifted the knife, her breaths coming in rasps. “I’ll try to minimize your suffering. Now lift your neck and hold very still.”\n\n-----------\n\nObviously, I survived. \n\nI attribute that to the fact that I’m not a good man. \n\nI can’t write anymore tonight. No amount of Valium is helping at this point. I hear that huffing bleach can cause brain damage; here’s to hoping that damage comes in the form of erased memories. \n\nI’ll explain what happened next if I’m able to get up off my bathroom floor.\n\n[FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": " Hi there, my NoSleepians! I have no idea who else to share this achievement with, given that I have no family or friends outside the cartel. Or more specifically, it's called the ‘Sagraten’ group. Even if I did talk about it to others, who would believe all this stuff about dimensions? Only you guys would. \n\nSo, dimensions. We live in one dimension, but there are many adjacent dimensions with different types of people that can only be accessed by portals. Got it?\n\nNext, the rundown on the drug I smuggled, called Karkara. It's actually a powder made from a leaf of the rare blue karkun tree, found on a dimension called Rohta'ara. Rohta'ara is a wild, forested place, save for the headquarters and operations of the various cartels. People buy the stuff for insane prices as it enhances the mind and body to unimaginable levels for a period of time, if you’re curious. So, our job is to transport it from Rohta’ara through a couple of dimensions like Earth to the locations the goods need to be going to. \n\nOr, at least, that's what I've heard so far. These things aren’t easy to understand\n\nAnyways, enough of that. You want to hear about my rise to power in particular, do you?\n\nAfter getting kicked out for being gay, being a broke 17 year old with no accepting family, I was forced to do drug deliveries and stuff for gangs. One day, a guy messaged me. Said he had a job for me. So, I met him and there started my participation in the Karkara smuggling cartel, bringing the dried leaves from one portal to the other. I didn't mind the conditions and loved that we got paid in gold, so I stayed.\n\nAbout 6 months later, I did something that first got the attention of my direct superiors.\n\nYou see, there's a reason creatures from other dimensions don't do their own dirty work here. Compared to everywhere else, Earth is so densely populated and so unaware of other dimensions that they'll stick out like a sore thumb and be easily caught. Oh, and if the cops got onto us... \n\nThat time, the cops did get onto us. We were delivering the goods when we were stopped at a police checkpoint, where they insisted on checking the truck. From where I was, at the back, I heard muffled voices of conversation.\n\n\"Open the back door. We need to inspect the cargo.\" instructed the police officer.\n\n\"Why?\" the driver, my friend Pedro, asked. I could hear the fear in his voice, and it was for a reason. If they spotted the cargo, it would be game over for all of us. They would definitely seize the unusual dried leaves, as it resembles many drugs we have on Earth.\n\n\"We've been tipped off about a huge shipment of drugs coming this way. Now open it!\"\n\nAs Pedro stalled for time while getting off the truck, my coworker Dennis whispered, “What do we do now?”\n\n“What do you normally do?”, I asked.\n\n“We, uh, make a run for it.”, Dennis explained, to which the other guy in the back with us nodded.\n\n“Fuck that,” I said as they looked to me in surprise. “I got a plan.”\n\n“That’s dangerous!”, he whispered anxiously as I heard the squeaky sound of the door being opened. As the door cracked open, I immediately dug the conveniently located packet of itching powder out of my pocket and flicked it all over the entrance. \n\nThe officer, none the wiser, stepped into the cargo hold and shone his flashlight at us and the boxes.\n\n“How many of you are in here?”, he asked.\n\n“Three people in the back here, officer.” I responded.\n\n“Now open one of- what the hell is this?” He asked, scratching furiously at his uncovered ankles and arms.\n\n“Sorry Officer,” I nonchalantly explained, “Some of the dust from our cargo really triggers allergies.” As he peered at me with annoyance, my heart was thundering in my chest despite my calm demeanour outside. I was doing some grade-A prime bullshitting there, and if he figured that out I was fucked.\n\nAs the cop stepped out and instructed his partner to avoid entering our truck, I exhaled a breath I didn’t even know I was holding. That was incredibly tense, and the police would have doubled down had they actually inspected the cargo. I knew this, because the old-timers had several stories of police seizing the cargo for being suspicious. Several times, I had been regaled by stories of daring missions to recapture our goods.\n\nLater, as we drove down the remote road, my coworkers lauded me.\n\n“How the hell did that work even?”, they asked. “You're a genius!”, they praised me, the first time in my life I really heard such praise. Personally, I couldn’t believe it worked, as that was a last ditch idea I came up with on the spot. Luckily I had the itching powder on me, as I saved their asses that day!\n\nBy the time we reached the Manitoban depot where the portal to the next dimension was located, my boss seemed to have known of my attempt to ward off the police, given that he pulled me aside.\n\n“Duante. What you did today? That saved the cargo. The higher-ups were pretty impressed.”\n\n“Wait. That was fast, how do you know?”, I asked.\n\n“We have cameras in the truck. We saw everything that unfolded. You’re sharp as a knife, kid. You’ll do well if you continue. Remember, the Karkara must always flow!”, he said, patting my shoulder before walking into the portal to oversee the shipment on its journey to the next dimension. Little did I know it, but that was when my path upwards opened up.\n\nThe grand series of events that eventually brought me here happened a few months later. This time, we were driving another shipment of leaves through a forest in Western Ontario. I was idly watching TikToks on my phone when I heard a sudden thump from under me.\n\n“What the hell was that?”, I asked as we manoeuvred the screeching truck to the side of the road next to the forest.\n\n“Tyre puncture!”, Pedro said. “We gotta get off the truck and change the tyre!”\n\nAs I hopped down from my seat, I noticed the huge nail we seemed to have driven over. So, that was the beauty that impaled us. As I walked towards the back to retrieve our trusty spare tyre, a teenage girl ran out of the bush and frantically waved her arms at us, startling me. \n\nWell, she was a sight to behold. Her arms and legs were covered in scratches, her clothes were torn up and she was panting heavily. While I was still apprehensive and shocked, Pedro first approached her. \n\n“What happened to you, dear?”, he asked.\n\n“They- they- they’re coming! I got k- kidnapped and sold, and they’ll take me away! Help me get home!”, she said between breaths. As I heard that, white-hot rage boiled in me. She had clearly been failed by the people around her!\n\nNo. That was not happening to someone else. No one else would be left to suffer themselves, the way I was. \n\nJust as I was about to reassure her, some creatures came bursting out of the woods on the other side of the highway. The girl let out a shriek, thinking it was her kidnappers, before realising it was much worse.\n\nThose creatures were monstrosities of nature, things that shouldn’t have existed in this place. They had perfectly triangular heads with one eye in each corner and a gaping triangular maw, along with a large ellipsoid body underneath it and 5 hairy legs. As they made a beeline for us and the truck, I realised that they were there specifically for our Karkara. Later, I would learn that these things were called the ‘wamas’ and that the rival cartels didn’t have any qualms about employing interdimensional monsters. The nerve of those little thieves… \n\nAnd with the most perfect timing, some men with assault rifles burst out of the bush. \n\n“Where’s that bitch? Find her!” one of them shouted at the others in a gruff voice.\n\nAs they scattered around the highway, Pedro warned me, “We’re only two people with pistols! We can’t fend off everyone!”\n\n“I gotcha bro!”, I replied, before grabbing the girl’s shoulders and bringing her closer.\n\n“Now listen babe,” I instructed, “If you want to survive, you have to follow every instruction I give you. To the letter. Understand?”\n\nShe stared at me fearfully with her black eyes, before nodding.\n\n“You see those things over there?” I asked, pointing to the wamas. “Go behind them.”\n\nShe took a few tentative, wobbly steps before looking back at me in fear.\n\n“Go!” I yelled. “They found us!”\n\n“Duante! What are you doing? This is madness!” Pedro yelled from the back of the truck, where he was presumably attempting to protect the cargo.\n\n“I have a plan!” I said, as one of the men approached me.\n\n“Did you see a young girl here? She ran away from home!”, the guy asked, glaring at me.\n\n“What does she look like? I think I saw someone run that way.”, I said, pointing in the direction of the wamas. Of course, they couldn’t see the wamas from that angle, so they took the bait and ran. A minute later, I heard screams and gunshots, and ungodly roars coming from the wamas. Perfect.\n\nImmediately, I moved on to the next stage of my plan by clambering up the thin ladder on the back of the truck. It was slippery and I almost lost my footing, but I eventually jumped onto the top of the lorry and unsteadily balanced myself.\n\nThe view from up top was glorious, as the wamas and men fought and killed each other. As the men fired desperately at the advancing wamas, causing them to stumble and flip over like cockroaches, the wamas spat out sharp metallic fragments that cleanly downed the fifteen or so men. Behind the large wamas, the girl squatted down and hid herself out of sight.\n\nAs the last man fell down, dead, the remaining two wamas continued shambling towards the truck.\n\n“A little help up here, Pedro?” I asked. Realising what I was going to do, he popped out of the truck and tossed a pistol up to me. \n\n“Shoot them straight in that goddamn mouth! That’s how you keep ‘em dead!”, he recommended. “Oh, and I’ll be changing the tyre!”\n\nCatching the pistol, I aimed straight at the wamas and shot it.\n\nBang. And luckily, my shot struck true and it died immediately.\n\nI aimed my pistol straight at the mouth of the last wamas, which was poised to break into our truck, and aimed straight at it. \n\nBang. And it died cleanly before it could take a single leaf from us.\n\nBy that time, the girl ran into the truck and sat next to the driver's seat and Pedro finished changing the wheel of the truck. \n\nAs I climbed into the back, I yelled, \"We're kinda behind schedule! Let's start now!\"\n\nAs he started the truck, he commented, \"That was insane! Thank goodness it worked!\"\n\nThe next leg of the trip went rather smoothly, until we stopped at a rest stop closer to our destination. There, I got off to stretch my legs and use the bathroom a bit.\n\nAs I came back, I peered into the driver's section and noticed that the girl was sleeping soundly. Well, that explained the lack of any conversation. \n\nBut where was Pedro?\n\nI noticed some noises in the back of the truck, so I opted to open the door.\n\n\"No! Don't open it!\" his voice rang out as I opened the door. It was too late though, for I witnessed him shovelling blue Karkara powder into his mouth. We stared at each other in shock and betrayal. \n\nNow, you see, us humans can’t take Karkara. It’s way too potent on us, and whoever takes it normally gets an extreme amount of power. In most cases, they end up destroying everything around them before eventually dying from the overload once the effects end. Essentially, it’s too dangerous.\n\nHe was the first to speak, insisting that he was doing all of this to provide for his family and all that. I, of course, didn't buy that nonsense, instead opting to drag him out by his collar while he pleaded with me to spare him. A few minutes later, we reached an isolated spot of grass.\n\n\"Duante, please don't do this!\" he begged. \"I really need this! I won't hurt you, I promise!\"\n\n\"If I waste even another minute, you'll become too strong to deal with. Sorry, but I must do this. Company policy is company policy, and it's for everyone's good. I'll provide for your family once you're gone.\" I tried to reason with him. I could already feel his grip on my sweatpants become harder and harder.\n\nAs he began sobbing, I put the pistol to his temple and fired 3 times, blood splattering all over my clothes, arm and pistol. But the deed was done, and the crisis was averted. Not wanting to bring Pedro's body all the way back to the truck, I surreptitiously dumped his body in a nearby river and washed the parts of me that got blood on them.\n\nTo this date, I’ve been supporting his family, since I managed to track them down.\n\nAfter buying some food and water for the girl, I got into the driver's seat and drove off.  While I'd only driven trucks on little side roads before, I saw how the others did it and managed to figure it out. Luckily, the girl was incredibly tired and only woke up when we were a half-hour away from the destination. \n\nI would have talked to her more, but I was preoccupied with my own problems and the way I had to kill Pedro. I never wanted to end Pedro, we were great friends in fact, but in the end I was forced to. It was his decision to mark himself for death, and there was nothing I could do.\n\n\"Where's the other guy?\" she asked while munching on her croissant. Observant girl. \n\n\"I dropped him off earlier.\" I lied. Seemingly satisfied by the answer, she didn't press me further. \n\nAs I drove into the old warehouse, I noticed an unusually large crowd milling around the place. Unusual because, well, no one really does that for a miserly delivery, of all things. And crowding isn’t encouraged to begin with due to the need to stay discreet.\n\nAs soon as I got off the truck, I was swarmed by the crowd, lauding me for the daring rescue of the girl and craftily fending off the wamas. In the hubbub, my boss along with some people I hadn’t seen before squeezed through to meet me while we unloaded the goods. While some of the other workers directed the girl to her resting compartments, I was ushered away by my boss.\n\n“Good job, son. The higher-ups are impressed by how you managed to get rid of the wamas. They’ve been stalking us and taking our cargo for months! Now our enemies will never try anything like this again.”\n\n“Wamas?” I asked.\n\n“The rival cartels sic these creatures called wamas on us just to steal the shipments. You didn’t know?” he responded.\n\n“No. Shouldn’t we have been better armed?” I asked.\n\n“You didn’t use the weapons we packed in there?” he said suspiciously. “Perhaps Pedro took them.”\n\nI didn’t know how to respond to that, so I just said, “Thank you.”\n\n“So anyways, the bosses want to meet you. The people on top, those who work in Rohta’ara.”\n\nFor a moment, I simply stood there and looked at him in shock, mouth agape. “Me? G- go there?” I asked in shock.  \n\n“Of course! You’ll be going to Rohta’ara tomorrow. I’ve heard that it’s quite important, as well. You’re being granted a position on the council. Good luck!” he responded.\n\nHearing of the council position, I quickly accepted. \n\nCuriously enough, they had dark circles of skin around their eyes, so they didn’t seem to be human.\n\n“Who are the other two people?” I asked him, surveyi\n\n“I’m Gakruth and this is Nabbri. We’ve come to show you the way to and in Rohta’ara, when you wish to come.” one of them responded in heavily accented English. It was rather obvious that they weren’t from Earth. \n\n“Alright, then. Oh, and what about the girl?” I asked my boss.\n\n“Huh?” he responded, as though he had forgotten about her.\n\n“What do we do with her?”\n\n“She knows too much about our ways. She’ll have to stay with us, for the time being. Now, you have to prepare for tomorrow.”\n\nSo, I stripped off my blood-soaked clothes, refreshed myself and slept. Awakening the next day, I swiftly ate, wore my best clothes and met Gakruth and Nabbri.\n\nGakruth pulled out a thin metal stick and wrote something on my forehead.\n\n“What’s that?” I asked. entered the emerald-green portal to Rohta’ara. \n\nI expected… something. Like, the feeling of me being disassembled and reassembled in the portal, or being sucked into a spiral, or something. I always wondered what it felt like, every time we shoved the boxes through the portal. Instead, I felt nothing. I walked in, and walked out on a whole new dimension. All that, when I hadn’t even travelled outside the country until I got this job!  \n\n\nRohta’ara was… breathtaking. I was told that the area we were in was only the side entrance, but from there, I could see the majestic red and blue forests carpeting the area, spreading as far as I could see. Behind me, sky-piercing, hauntingly beautiful mountains stretched across the landscape in long ranges. As I took in the view, Nabbri led to me some sort of pack animal to ride on. It looked like some sort of flattened elephant with the hooves of a zebra and a small head that reminded me of a meerkat’s. Oh, and it had two large black wings on its sides.\n\n“It’s a karyuku. Here, this is what we use for transport and carrying goods.” Nabbri explained. I climbed on it as he instructed me to, and it trotted and flew alternatively on the well maintained shiny white path up the hill. Around me, I saw many such animals, some with the leaves on their backs, some carrying troughs of gold (give me the money baby!) and some carrying other people.\n\n“I’m wondering….” I started.\n\n“What is it?” Nabbri asked. “Out with it!”\n\n“What does Rohta’ara mean even?”\n\n“It is an archaic term for the red-and blue glow of the sunrise reflecting off the forest onto the pristine, bare white mountain cliffs.”\n\nSounded awfully specific, but okay.\n\nEventually, we reached the hill top and disembarked from the karyuku. In front of me lay a huge building, reminiscent of Greek temples in its gleaming white marble and astounding arches.\n\n“Here,” Gakruth said proudly, “The headquarters of the Sagraten. On top of what we call Kankommala hill.”\n\n“It’s… it’s majestic.” I responded. That was the only thought I had on my mind, for I had never seen such beauty before. Nothing on Earth could compare, quite literally.\n\nBehind me, Nabbri cleared his throat. “That’s enough ogling, get in! We’re already late!”\n\nBreaking out of my reverie, I let myself be ushered through the lavish corridors into a meeting room, where around twenty people already sat on a long table. It wouldn’t be accurate to say ‘people’, really, for most of them were a different species. Some had light red skin, some had large horns on their heads and a significant majority had pointed, cat-like ears. My companions bowed to them before exiting the room.\n\nThe magnificent being with pale skin and pointy ears sitting at the head of the table introduced himself in a melodious voice, “Greetings. I am Navraki, and these are my associates Parlraki, Tumbag, Phreked, Silris and Dusra.”, gesturing at each person around him.\n\n“Greetings, I am Duante. I thank you for this gift of meeting these esteemed people.” I said, hoping it sounded formal enough. His only response was a thin smile.\n\n“Now, we shall convene this council and discuss the reason we meet. Your talents will be required, for we will be at war.”\n\nA minor stir rose among us, but died down as Navraki held up a bejewelled hand. \n\n“For years, we have competed with the Kalhuvum. Our rivals, for the uninitiated. They have many a time thwarted us, halted our plans, cut into our profits.”\n\n“But from today, we will take over their business.”\n\n“What do you plan?” asked Tumbag, his red chin moving furiously.\n\nNavraki smiled, which unsettled me. “Your kinsmen, Tumbag.” he responded.\n\nTumbag looked confused.\n\n“Our great allies, the Ghakrat.” Navraki pulled up a well illustrated, old-style map. “To explain it to you simpletons, here’s a map. Here, we will plunder the Kalhavum of their weapons. Using it, we will slaughter the Ghakrat wholesale. The Kalhavum shall be blamed for the slaughter, and their allies shall turn their backs on them, for slaughter of all is forbidden. Then, we shall destroy the Kalhavum. In one swoop, we will take control of the resources of both, and shall control the market with a majority.”\n\n“Now, we shall all share our advice. Even the lowliest of us.”, he said, with a pointed glance at me. \n\nWhile most of them surprisingly gave noncommittal answers, I dissented when my turn came.\n\n“I feel it’s unwise to betray our enemies like this. What if it goes wrong? We’ll be done for, then. This is too much risk!”\n\n“You dare question me?”\n\n“This is madness!” I yelled.\n\n“You’re just a human. Never forget that. Now, you will follow my orders!” he said calmly as I seethed.\n\nThe plan he laid out for me, essentially, was that I would sneak into the Kalhavum base through a rather conveniently located shortcut and quietly take out anyone who resisted me. Once I got in, I’d call for several karyuku to come in to do all the dirty work of carrying away their weapons (apparently medieval weaponry like swords). Well, real convenient.\n\nYeah, that was my only job. But I saw how he saw me, and it reminded me of all the people back home, everyone who looked down on me. Nah, fuck that. I got thrown into this rather suddenly, but I was going out my own way.\n\nHe rather helpfully provided me with a map and left me alone, So, I cooked up my own plan as I rode down the hill.\n\nFirst, I went to the utilitarian-looking, rocky base of the Kalhavum group. Told them that Navraki wished to meet the entire cartel immediately, all while pretending to tremble like a kid that lost their mommy at the store. I advised that they go to the main entrance, just to achieve my goal of maximum bloodshed.\n\n“Gonna meet us huh, the little ‘kees? They’ll get a meeting! Go tell them that.” the magnificently horned leader responded in an incredibly thick accent that I could barely parse. I nodded, whimpering, “Yes, my Lord.” before leaving.\n\nIt rankled me to give random people so much respect, no matter who they claimed to be, but I needed it for my plan to work.\n\nNext, I went to our good friends the Ghakrat group. The map was easy to follow, but still I went up and down hills and mountains and tread through dense forests to reach their place. Let me tell you this, even on a karyuku, all that movement tired the shit outta me. Oh, and everything in me hurt for days! But yeah, I had to meet them for the plan to work.\n\nOf course, I told them that the Kalhavum and Sagraten were oh-so-jealous of their market clout and collaborated in a grand plan to end them. I let slip that the best way to stop them in their tracks was to go straight up to Kankommala hill and stop this betrayal in its infancy. Oh, and I advised that those shifty little Kalhavum might start fighting the Sagraten, as well. Technically, it was half-correct, wasn't it?\n\nAs they assembled their magnificent, destructive war machines and called out legions of military-like henchmen, I internally rubbed my hands with glee. I had no clue how time worked in Rohta’ara, but if my Earth watch and rough calculations were right, the Ghakrat would come right when the other two were fighting and join in the fun. \n\nAfter leading them to the hill, I opted to hide in a nearby cave and nap for the night (I came there at sunset), hoping that the scattered sounds of earth-rocking explosions wouldn’t awaken me too much. \n\nWhen I woke up (in the middle of said night), there was no more noise outside, save for the sounds of weird birds surrounding the remains of armour, weapons and bodies of twenty different species scattered all over the hill. It seemed that the armies had fought each other and almost wholly taken each other out in the process. While I was riding my karyuku up the hill, its frequent alternating between flying and trekking meant that my Nikes were ruined from all the dirt and gore lining the hill.\n\nWell, whatever.\n\nOnce again, I touched down on the hard, rocky surface of the hilltop and made my way towards the main building, which had large chunks taken out of it from the battle. Along the way, I saw the bodies of the leaders and council members near each other, unmistakably dead. My plan had undoubtedly worked!\n\nNow, our base looked more like a modern Greek temple, all run down. When I went in, I noticed that the place had been wholly converted into an infirmary of sorts, with the rest of the uninjured people clearing up the debris that was found everywhere. As I sauntered in, they all turned to me.\n\nWe stared at each other for a solid minute. Then, I spoke.\n\n“What has happened to all those on the council?” I asked those assembled in the building.\n\nThey stared at me for another minute, before one brave soul spoke out. “They have all been slain. The leaders of all 3 major groups have been slain. You alone live.” she explained.\n\nI nodded to show that I heard her. Immediately, cries of “All hail the new leader!” rang out across the area, echoes reflecting off the once ornate crumbling white walls. \n\n“Please,” I said, “Just call me by my given name. Duante.”. I was never one for things like titles, after all!\n\n“As you wish, Duante.”\n\nAnd there it was. No fancy ceremonies or transfers of title, but I was the leader, plain and simple. Maintaining the supply chain was not too hard, since I just had to send messengers and go around the portals saying “Yo guys, I’m the bossman now” to the buyers. The remaining bigwigs in the rival cartels, too, didn’t protest. The hubbub I stirred must have gotten them scared. \n\nI ended up learning a dirty secret as well, that the transport and sale of Karkara was actually prohibited in theory in many dimensions, which was how the entire cartel system and all the under-the-table discreet smuggling came to be. Cool, huh?\n\nAlright, that was a bit of a long post, but there’s nothing wrong with a little boasting. I’m still alive, though, so congrats to me! \n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/NightbringerWrites)",

This rule is for kids only, If you are 13 years old or above, You must follow the next rules.\n\n3. Don't open any doors or let anyone in. If you hear someone asking for help DO NOT LET THEM IN, They are either getting attacked by IT or it's using them as bait. IT can mimic the voice of IT's victims, It can also change the form, It can take a form of a human or your dog. Forget about your dog, forget about the animals, If they're unlucky to be chosen as food then you can always replace them.\n\n4. Get ready for defense. If it somehow breaks in prepare to fight, You can use the pitchfork and spade for defense only, grandpa will be using the shotgun. What we're dealing with is no ordinary creature, no matter what you do, do not attack it first, It's best to wait for it to attack or choose its prey. If it finally chose who to eat, prepare to fight, It won't fight anyone else but its prey so others can attack it without it fighting back, If you're chosen then you must be prepared to defend yourself. If we hurt it enough it will run away, We can only scare it away for a while but we can't kill it, It will always come back. If we're lucky enough that it didn't choose anyone, Barricade the doors again, It might change its mind.\n\n5. Stay awake. You must stay awake until sunrise, Drinking energy juice or coffee can help. Don't be relieved that it's away, Even if we scared it away it might come back for revenge.\n\n6. Clean up. clean all the mess that was made by IT, Throw all dead bodies away and leave no evidence of IT attacking anyone, The children must not see them, It's better if they don't know about IT until they're old enough.\n\n7. Don't ask about IT. Don't tell anyone about IT, Don't go to the woods and search for IT, And most importantly, Don't ask grandpa about it. when you're old enough grandpa will tell you about it, He’ll only tell you what IT does and what to do, and after that, he won't answer any questions about IT and he will be upset if you ask about IT. They say It lives near the woods but comes hunting for food in farms and houses, they also say IT doesn't belong to this world and IT was somehow related to grandpa, They also say grandpa feeds IT But it's all just rumors from people who know about IT.\n\nThat's all the rules you must follow at grandpa’s farm, Make sure to follow them if you want to stay alive. Good luck.",

        "text": "For decades, the origin of the Pyramids of Giza have been pondered. Theories like it go as far back as aliens abducting cows in farmers fields, sighting of Bigfoot and Sasquches, and the Illuminati. Keyword: theories. None of them have been proven to be true until now. The year is 2067. Archeologists and government officials are scratching their head wondering where the hell the capstone of the Great Pyramid has disappeared to. And ever since then, laws forbidding the scaling of the pyramids have only been more stringent. \n\n2067/07/01 // Operation Day #31 // Month 1 // Status: Active\n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. It's been over a month in this whole. As a boy I never imagined I would step fourth the chamber of the King. It's not as spectacular as I imagined it to be. It's all just sandstone and more dust than my old apartment generated in a decade. But I can't play thus down either, it's still the coolest thing I had ever done in my life. Maybe when this is all over I can bring my kids down here. They would love this sort of thing. Oh I can hear Jackson already. \"Dad over here, dad see this, dad what's that?\" He's loved this stuff since he was a kid. Watched to much Indiana Jones. I'd say. Maybe a hint of Pirates of the Caribean too.\"\n\n2067/0702 // Operation Day #32 // Month #1 // Status: Active\n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Lieutenant Markus and I finally managed to get some good sleep last night. No longer do I fear this place. The first week here I got an hour of sleep only cause I passed out in the heat. These damn uniforms do not hesitate to contain heat. For fucks sake we aren't in Antartica anymore. We don't need inch thick protective gear, nothing in a several thousand year old tomb will awaken. And if you mean skeletons without muscle mass, they are a pushover. Ehh, this entry was to complain. We gonna be here a while. No sense is bringing the mood down complaining to Abraham, Markus, or Annabelle. Being trapped in a pyramid doesnt exaclty leave A LOT of room to blow steam.\"\n\n2067/07/06 // Operation Day #36 // Month #1 // Status: Active.\n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Today i began to start hearing strange noise from the depths of the tomb. They weren't all that apparent but they were just noticable enough to pick up. Strange when ever I hear those noises, I get a feeling like someone is watching me. Ehh, it's probably Markus or Annabelle. No sense in riling up the place with superstitious theories and concerns. Moods already bad enough down here. No need to fuel the fire with petty concerns of hearing problems.\"\n\n2067/07/12 // Operation Day #42 // Month 1# // Status: Active. \n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. All I can think about is Jackson, Meela, and Lukas. I think those noises are getting to me. It's been a month and a half since I saw the lad, Jackson. He turned 17 three days ago. And I missed it. That's all for today. I just needed to vent some air. Blow some steam, y'know.\"\n\n2067/07/27 // Operation Day #57 // Month 1# // Status: Active. \n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. The noises, it's as if they are beckoning me fourth unto the depths. I am not alone in my hearing either. Annabella and Markus have begun hearing shit too. But they got it worse. Allegedly, they're seeing shit now too. I haven't got that far in my delusions yet. What ever power resides above, please save us from these illusions.\" \n\n2067/08/10 // Operation Day #71 // Month 2# // Status: Active. \n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. Things have gotten strange around here. Abraham has been more dedicated to his work in the recent weeks it's often days before we see him sleep in his cot. It's almost driven him mad I'd say. We've been down in hell for so long it's likely getting to him. We have all begged him to call in airsupport as we have found nothing but weird object though. Sort of reminiscent of my 1911 here. But they are more closely related to rock with hollow cavities inside them hmm, interesting.\n\n2067/09/30 // Operation Day #91 // Month 2# // Status: Active. \n\"Ethan Faulkner, First Lieutenant of the United States Marine Corps. Assignment designation: New Order. We have unearthed more discoveries. Longer rocks with more hollowed out sections inside. Some kind of scorching happened inside the rock too. Strange, it feels like igneous rock. Solidified magma. Yet even then, the scorching inside the rock feels like... I don't know... dust or ash. It's hard to say.\"\n\n2067/10/16 // Operation Day #107 // Month 3# // Status: Active. \n\"Shame, it's almost Christmas. One i wanted to spend with Kiera and the kids. See them open their presents, and the joy on their faces.. I didn't really except 3 months ago to be exploring the Pyramids of Giza. And I NEVER expected 3 fucking months down here either! I feel like that shit I heard from my teacher Mr. Bradley was bullshit \"joining the army or the marine Corps is an honorable thing to do.\" Bullshit... absolute bullshit...\" \n\n\n2067/10/31 // Operation Day #122 // Month 3# // Status: Active. \n\"There have been talk from Markus, Annabelle and Jun to scale the wall back to the surface. Thing is, we don't have enough rope. We thought of typing the rope together. Jun did the math. We would stop short by about 60%. Fuck it! It's time to do what has been planned for months. Relieving Dr. Abraham as Assignment director and duty. This begins tomorrow. This strikes the fourth month.\"\n\n2067/11/01 // Operation Day #107 // Month 3# // Status: Active. \n\"Live broadcast begins in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Dr. Abraham.

Our health has declined rapidly. Teeth have been falling out. Sress has enveloped to consciousness of your subordinates. You are, here by, relieved of duty and honorably discharged from this assignment. \n\nDr. Abraham\n\"No wait. I've come so close to cracking the mystery!!\" \n\nFirst Lieutenant Faulkner, Ethan.\n\"You have been ordered and discharged. Displacement of one's self from Assignment QZ is recommended.

Well, that was until last night. He came back. This time his eye was dark red, with a black pupil. This time also standing right next to my bed. While staring into his eye...I could see what true evil looked like ... Then it shook it's head, and walked away. I then woke up. I Do not know what that thing truly is, but it could have killed me if it really wanted to.\n\nGoodbye\n\n26 August\nDear Diary\n\nI pulled an all nighter yesterday working on a school project. I Fell asleep in class today. When I woke up my classroom was empty and the blinds closed. I stood up and tried leaving the empty and cold classroom, but to my surprise the door was locked. I tried yelling for help to no avail. I tried kicking the door down but it wouldn't budge. All of a sudden I could hear something fall on the floor, like a pencil. I Instantly turned back only to be greeted with darkness. It was as if the classroom was divided into 2 rectangular pieces, one completely dark, it looked like a gateway to pure nothingness, the other completely light. I stared into the darkness for what felt like an eternity but was then meeted with that same luminescent light I have grown accustomed to. Upon this image I could hear sobbing, but it spoke, \"Why do you always do this? YOU. NEVER. LISTEN.\" I then woke up in my bed, What did it mean by this?  To say that I was confused was an understatement.\n\nPerhaps I will see you again, perhaps not.\n\n5 September\nDear Diary\n\nLast Night...oh last night. It was in my room again, Unlike my sleep paralysis episodes...I could move. How could this be? But that means that...It wasn't restricted to my sleep paralysis episodes. It wasn't staring at me, instead his back was turned on me. Looking into the lightness of the outside world. I could see that it was 2 AM...how was there light as bright as the sun entering into my room from my window. It was standing in the darkness, it let out a big sigh, and moved his hand from the darkness into the light. He yelled out of agony and pain, and dropped down on his knees. It spoke, \"Do you see what you are doing to me? Do you realize the pain you cause me? Open. Your. Eye-\" He was interupted by my door opening, and it had vanished as quickly as it had entered. It was my dad who had entered my room, he asked me if I were alright, because I had been screaming. I did not scream. What was he talking about. I want answers\n\nI'm Getting tired of this.\n\n\nSeptemer 13\nDear Diary\n\nTonight is the last night, well if I can move again. I hid a baseball bat under my bed, and am planning on confronting that thing. Wish me Luck\n\nSeptember 14\nIt didn't work, well, it did but not as I had hoped. I don't precisely know what happened but everything was going well, I could move again during this fake \"episode\" And meanwhile the watcher was sitting on my bed, looking at my closet, once again with his back turned on me, I could hear he was speaking, I just dont know what he was saying. So I picked the best moment possible to strike. I quietly picked up the bat from under my bed, and Hit it against the head. It didn't move, it didn't even flinch. It just sat there in silence for a mere seconds, then started laughing. It looked down shaking it's head, \"Maybe You dont't need me afterall, you got some fight in you yet.\"\n\n\n1 January, 2023\nDear Diary\n\nThis truly is the last time I will write in this thing. I haven't gotten a single sleep paralysis episode since then. Well, that wasn't really sleep paralysis, as I could move and wasn't well...paralyzed. I still do not know what \"The Watcher\" meant when he said that maybe I didn't need him anymore, but I think about it as if though it was a protector, protecting me from what? Not sure. But I don't think I wanna know.\n\n\nGoodbye",

        "text": "To whom it may concern, my only purpose for writing this is to leave a warning. I am unsure of how many people this will reach, I can only hope it is enough to spread the truth.\n\nFor your own safety, I will refrain from sharing the location and name of the town I've grown to know. But I assure you, you'll know if you ever find your way there. There is a grim setting, and the townsfolk aren't exactly welcoming. There is also a large woodland to the far left of the town, this information will be important later. As soon as you enter, you'll find that every corner you turn, you'll see dozens of missing posters and a warning notice put out by the town's community. The notice tells about bizarre entity that has been roaming the town for about a year now. The notice provides many photos of the entity, and it's appearance is indeed quite bizarre, I must admit. \n\nThe entity is about 8 feet tall at full height, but is mostly seen hunched over. It has the skull of a wildebeest for a head, and its lower body is concealed by a large cloak. The only limbs visible to the naked eye are its hooved legs. Within the empty eyesockets of its skull, its eyes glow a ghostly blue. Many of the townsfolk who have encountered it say that its long bony hands have retractable claws. One of the most upsetting details about this creature is understandably the fact that its entire torso is caked with blood.\n\nThe townsfolk have good reason to fear this entity, for whenever its seen walking down the streets, it almost always has the mutilated corpse of what used to be a citizen in its arms. However, what the entity does with the body is baffling to the townsfolk. No matter how badly disembodied the corspe is, the entity will always take great care to leave it against the gates of the local cemetery located in the center of the city. Afterwards, the entity disappears without a trace. As of now, there have been over 300 disappearances and 150 deaths. All bodies of the 150, varying in age and gender, were laid to rest after the entity brought them all back.\n\nThis has lead to many different conspiracies about the entity. While the majority of the population believes that the entity is responsible for all the deaths, some can't help but wonder why it goes through all the trouble of bringing the body back after presumably being responsible for the victim's demise. What's even more bizarre, is that those who has encountered the entity when it was carrying a dead body, claim that it made eye contact with them, but showed no hostility. Theories upon theories were made, and some people don't even know what to believe anymore.\n\nAs for myself, well... I could care less about those theories, for I know something, witnessed something, for the umpteenth time.\n\nI was stalking through the woods just outside the town, as I always do, when I noticed a trail of broken branches. Mumbling to myself, I followed the branches until I came to a seemingly dead end. I was about to turn back, when the sound of heavy, rattling breathes filled the air. I followed the sound, and came across a middle-aged man, his clothes filthy from stumbling around the woods in the dead of night. He made eye contact with me, and his face morphed into the haunted expression I've grown accustomed to seeing.\n\nHe staggered back from me, and turned to run. A deathly shriek pierced the air like that of lightning, and the shadows began to move. The poor fool had little to no time to react, the shadows arose, and I knew \"it\" was here. The man was knocked to the ground, and the shadows had revealed themselves as one. A massive, bipedal, and ghastly beast. Spikes protruded from its shoulder blades, and rips and tears littered its skeletal body, resembling faces stuck screaming in eternal anguish. It lifted its head, large tusks dripping with fluids.The beast leaped on top of the man. It opened its mouth, revealing rows upon rows of jagged teeth, and bit into the man's neck. His agonized screech filled my skull, and I could only do so much as watch as he choked on his own blood. The beast then raised its massive scythe like claws, and tore into the man's stomach. Entrails were ripped out, the squelching of flesh being slashed through only intensified my dread.\n\nI then realized, the beast hadn't noticed me, its back was facing me. It was strong, but if I could just catch it off guard. Maybe I could finally put an end to this, I've met this creature enough times to know it wasn't invincible. I took my chance, I crept closer, ignoring the man's final desperate gasps for air. I could feel my nails elongating... this could be my chance... this could finally put an end to everything...\n \nAn obnoxious *CRUNCH* filled the forest as I stepped on an accursed twig. The beast snapped around, bellowing lowly. We made eye contact, my nails returned to their normal size as we both knew my chance of finally putting an end to this creature's miserable existence had been diminished. Its mouth curved into a snarl, and with a final croon, its body melted in on itself, and it had once again taken the form of the shadows littering the forest.\n\nA tired breath of air escaped my nose, and I approached the long since disemboweled man. His cloudy half-lidded eyes devoid of life. His organs squished under my hooved feet as I numbly bent down and lifted him with ease, his blood splattering all over my already stained cloak. It was time to go through this routine again. It was still dead of night, so fortunately, not many people would be out to see me. With that in mind, I made my way back to the town. As I passed through the dark streets, I did end up encountering a couple civilians, and sure enough, upon seeing the mutilated man in my arms, they staggered away with that same haunted expression. Paying no mind to it, I continued walking until I reached my destination. The cemetery was growing bigger with each passing month, it was only a matter of time before there would be more graves than people alive. I lumbered towards the gate, and gently placed the man in a sitting position against the bloodied gate, where I've put every other casualty I've come across. Giving him one last look, I turned and vanished into the night, leaving the townsfolk to give him his proper send-off.\n\nIf you've made it this far, chances are you're probably aware of my identity. I'm sure you have many questions of who or what I am. I won't say much, but I can affirm that I am far from human. The only human-like feature I have would be my self-awareness and intelligence. As for how I'm writing this message, I found a device that humans use to communicate with each other on the forest floor. I've learned to keep my distance, I don't blame the folks for seeing me as a twisted beast. They've come up with several names for me, none of which scream welcoming. The true monster never reveals itself until its locked on its prey, afterwards, it dissappears. As I've said, I've faced it many times before, but have never been successful in striking it down. Why all the townsfolk are still there is beyond me, then again, I'm sure the beast will find a way to continue to feed on the innocent.\n\nAs of now, I can only hope it will show itself again so I can face it, but I have little hope that I can stop it. If by some chance, you read this message and come across this cursed town, please spread the message. Let them know, that I'm not the monster they should be worried about.",

        "text": "When I was a kid, I had an experience in Mexico that has haunted me. I’m not even sure it really happened or if it was just a nightmare. I was on a road trip with my parents driving down through Mexico heading for Guadalajara to see family and take a vacation. I had turned ten the month before. The first part of the trip was amazing. We filled the long hours on the road with games and songs. We stopped at tourist traps to see weird stuff and get souvenirs. I remember it was the last time my parents looked genuinely happy. Before that trip they had fights now and then, but they never lasted long and in between they seemed happy. But after what happened in Mexico, their smiles never reached their eyes, if they bothered to smile at all.\n\nAll of this started when we arrived at a small gas station. There was only one car at one of the only two pumps and it was empty except for a long dark figure sitting in the back seat, not moving. I couldn’t stop staring at this man. He sat staring straight ahead, still as a statue. I thought it must be a prop for a Halloween decoration because he looked like one of those mummies I remembered from a museum we had stopped to see. I didn’t like that place and my mom didn’t either. My dad tried to explain it was a part of history and that we should look on the face of death some time in our lives. They ended up having the only argument they’d had up to that point in the trip but once we left they seemed to forget it.\n\nThe man looked like one of those mummified people we had seen behind glass. His skin was hard and dry as wood, his eyes were sunken, and his hair was stringy and black and sat on his head like dried algae. I thought maybe it really was one of the mummies from the museum, maybe someone was moving it or had stolen it. When my dad got back to pump the gas, he told my mom that the owner of the car had just gotten out and walked out into the plains without saying a word. He had talked with the station owner and said he had called a tow truck to take the car away so customers could use the pump. He didn’t say anything about the figure in the back, even when my dad went over and looked inside, it was like he couldn’t see him.\n\nWhen I looked back at the thing in the car I nearly peed my pants when I saw it was looking at me. I yelled and scrambled to the other side of the car, scaring my mom who asked what was wrong. When I told her about the man in the backseat she just looked confused and said no one was there. When I looked back I felt a wave of relief when I saw it was empty. My dad got back in the car and was looking over the road map they had been using, I could tell something was bothering them. They argued about the road they were on and which way would get them where they wanted to go. I looked back at the car and still saw nothing, reassuring myself. What did I see? A ghost? A dream? My parents were arguing more loudly now and I looked over to see if the station owner was watching. What I saw instead made my heart stop in my chest.\n\nThe man was standing just outside the door on the opposite side of the car. He was tall so I could only see his dirty pants and his sunken stomach. I saw he wore a filthy trench coat that was patchy and worn through at the elbows and shoulders. He leaned down to look through the window at me and grinned. That’s when I saw his eyes were hollow pits, empty craters that looked bottomless even in the bright daylight. His thin leather lips drew back from his dusty yellow teeth and black dried gums in a mockery of a smile. I couldn’t hear my parents anymore, I could only hear the roar of my heart beat in my ears. How had they not seen him? Why hasn’t the gas station owner come out to question why this man was harassing his customers? When the door handle clicked and began to open I tried to scream but only made a dry hissing sound. I grabbed for the handle of the door as I saw the head of the man ducking to enter the car.\n\nI spilled out of the car, scraping my knees on the cracked road and crab walked away, staring at the dark man as he crawled into the back seat like a withered spider. My parents noticed me and stopped arguing, getting out to ask what was wrong. I pointed at the man in the back seat but they looked and saw nothing. I shouted that there was a strange man in the back but my dad went over and looked closely, his face only inches away from the man’s, before turning back and looking visibly frustrated. My mom looked sympathetically at me but my dad seemed to lose all patience, returning to his argument about the map with my mom. She compromised with him about it just to get back on the road and told me to get in. I looked at the man, who had taken the seat next to mine and sat as he had in the car before, only he was looking at me, baring his teeth in a skeletal smile.\n\nI refused to sit with him, even when my mom begged and began losing her patience. My dad looked ready to hit me and got out of the car and screamed for me to get in or he’d leave me there. I had never seen my dad like that before. It was a betrayal that cut deep, severing something precious and irretrievable. I was afraid of my father for the first time and it was like losing faith in God. I got up and went to sit next to the man without looking at him. After slamming the door so hard it nearly cracked the window, my dad drove off with a squeal of tires that frightened both me and my mother. \n\nTime seemed to pass in bundles, sometimes unbearably slow and suddenly moving forward without notice. The dark man sat motionless as he had before, staring blankly ahead without a sound. The car smelled stale and rotten, like a long dead animal baked and bleached by the sun. My mother complained about the smell many times but my dad would snap at her and tell her to ignore it. There were no songs now. No road games or stops for anything. I had to beg my dad to stop so I could use the bathroom and he only did when my mom began to beg him as well. The whole time we were stopped my dad paced impatiently, looking like a man who was extremely late for work or feared being caught by unknown pursuers.\n\nThey argued constantly, fighting over the directions, arguing about where they were, yet still my dad drove on. One of the arguments ended when he began to scream so viciously I saw spit dripping from his chin and his face had gone a plum color. My mother was threatening to jump out of the car to get away from him and he laughed cruelly, daring her to try. I cried in the back, yelling for them to stop fighting and my dad spun around to glare at me with a hatred I had never seen before. I shrunk back into my seat and said nothing. The man next to me had turned to me, his empty eyes seeming to draw in the air from the car and his rawhide lips pulled back in a toothy smile.\n\nWe drove for what must have been days, never stopping unless forced to by nature. My dad looked like a damned soul, gripping the steering wheel so tight I could see crumbs of leather falling from it. My mother either sat silent and impassive, like an empty shell, or she sobbed quietly until my dad would bark at her to stop. All the while, the dark man sat in silence, like a man on a bus heading home from work.\n\nIt was during a particularly heated argument over the upcoming town that my mom finally snapped and began slapping and clawing at my dad who bellowed like a wounded bear, trying to protect himself and keep the car under control. I was screaming in the back as the car swung from side to side. There was a loud thud like a slab of meat dropped on a wooden floor and my mother reeled away, covering her face. My dad regained control, wiping blood from his eyes and focusing on exiting the highway.  We had come to a small town that looked abandoned and the sun had turned a burnt orange on the horizon. The car slid to a stop and my dad turned the car off and took the keys out in one motion.\n\nThe engine ticked slightly and hissed as the various mechanisms settled within it. I could hear my dad breathing heavy, he was staring ahead blankly, like a man in a trance. Then my mother got out of the car and walked away, heading out away from the ghost town they had arrived at. The car was thick with silence that rang in my ears. I could hear my dad’s heavy breathing begin to hitch and shudder. His eyes were shining and red. I looked at the dark man beside me and heard the click of the door opening. Silent as a spider moving across its web, he exited the car with strange unnatural movements before turning to look back at me inside. He lifted a long bony finger to his dry lips and made a rattling hiss that sounded like the wind passing through bones. Then he turned and walked toward the town, moving with a liquid smoothness that made no sound and disturbed no ground.\n\nI watched the world darken as the sun disappeared behind the mountains and somewhere out there I heard the cries of coyotes. My dad took a long breath and let it out with a sudder. He looked back at me and began to sob openly. Somehow, seeing my dad weep uncontrollably was more terrifying than seeing him enraged. I had no idea what to do or what to say. I wanted to open the door and run out into the desert, just to get away from everything. The sounds of the coyotes yelping and barking kept me from leaving the car. \n\nAfter a while my dad seemed to calm down and slumped over on the steering wheel. He must have fallen asleep because he didn’t react when the coyote calls came closer to us. It was full dark now and my mom left the door open when she walked away. I could see a vision of the coyotes jumping in through the open door and attacking my dad as he was slumped helplessly over the wheel. I moved and my body felt like it was moving through pudding, the muscles ached from the tension. I managed to crawl forward enough to pull the car door shut with a loud slam that cut the sounds of the outside world off like a switch. I was afraid for my mom out there, worried she wouldn’t come back or would be attacked by wild animals.  I locked the doors and laid down across the back seat, the smell of the strange man still lingering.\n\nI must have fallen asleep because one moment it was dark and the next the sky had turned a lighter blue. When I sat up my dad was awake and looking out at the morning. He asked if I’d seen mom and I told him not since she walked away. He looked down with a shame that made my chest hurt. He started apologizing and I tried to reassure him but he just kept saying he was sorry over and over. I pointed out a car coming toward us and he seemed to brighten, The car pulled up to us and my mother got out, sending a wave of relief over me. My dad choked slightly and got out. They looked at each other for a moment, hesitating, before hugging and shaking with sobs. \n\nThe man had picked up my mother on the side of the road saying he spotted a large pack of coyotes following behind her. She told him where we were and he brought her back, offering to help them figure out the map. Once the sun had risen fully, I got out and looked around the car. I could see a circle of prints around it in the dust and even a few on the hood where something had jumped up in the night to stare inside at us. The man who helped my mom was confused how we ended up at this ghost town. With the map he showed us that we’d gone hundreds of miles off course. Both my parents were stunned and claimed the map they had been using showed them a completely different area.\n\nBefore the man left, I went to him and told him about the dark man who sat next to me that my parents couldn’t see. He almost jumped back at this, making the sign of the cross. He told me the man was a Brujo, a dark witch that spread misery and death wherever they went. He made me promise not to speak of him to anyone and to try not to think of him at all. Doing so may draw him back to me.\n\nAfter that, my parents decided to end our vacation early. The drive home was silent but not as tense as before. They talked little about what had happened, my mother claiming she felt a wave of relief when she had gotten a distance away from the car and my dad saying he felt the same relief sometime after she had left. I said nothing, focusing on the passing scenery to keep the memory of the Brujo from my mind. After that trip, my parents were never the same. They never laughed or smiled at each other and only rarely smiled at me. Something had been taken from them it seemed, like a vital part of their happiness was crushed out forever. I never saw the Brujo again and I never told anyone about it until now. I can hear coyotes in the distance as I write this. I’m worried this may have been a mistake to write. I don’t care anymore. The memory has been sitting on my mind like a spoiled lump, poisoning me. I had to get it out. Whatever happens, happens.",

        "text": "Ever since I was a little kid I enjoyed spooky stories. I don't really know why. It started with your typical urban legends told in hushed tones when the end of october was near.\n\nAs I got older, and had less friends, I started spending more time alone. I think it wasn't entirely normal for a child aged 10 to be awake at 2 AM watching horror shows, but my single mother didn't care, anyways. I used to watch anything from the more child friendly Courage the Cowardly Dog, to the slightly more spooky shows about exploring abandoned places and finding \"real\" ghosts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurprisingly for my age, I always knew everything I saw wasn't real. I never believed in ghosts. But I watched all of those shows anyways. There's something about the feeling of terror that captured my curiosity as a kid. I'm talking about terror, though. Not horror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHorror is what you feel when the pack of ravenous wolves is sprinting towards you with drooling mouths. It is what you feel when the monster is in front of you, and there is no doubt in your mind it will do something awful to you if your fight or flight instinct doesn't save you. You could argue that horror is also what you feel when someone scares you, or there is a jumpscare in the movie you're watching, despite it lasting for just an instant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerror, on the other hand is different. It is a sense of dread you feel despite the lack of a murder monster lunging itself at you with pure hatred. It's what you feel when you think you could be in danger, but aren't sure where the danger is coming from. Sometimes, you don't even know where your terror comes from, and that makes it even worse. One moment you're just thirsty and the next, you feel like someone's watching you from the open door of the bathroom, at the other end of the hallway. Did you leave the door open? Why is it darker there than in the hall. Wait, now that you turned your head towards the bathroom you think you saw someone standing in the living room, looking at you, from the periphery of your vision, while you were turning around. Or was it just a pile of clothes on a chair?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerror is created solely by your mind. It exists in our minds to protect us. You see, when our ancestors saw a tiger in the tall grass and there was nothing there, feeling terror was actually helpful. Because, if they just ignored that feeling because it wasn't strong enough, there might just be a real tiger, waiting for the right moment to pounce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's exactly why, when simply watching a movie, listening to a podcast, or reading a story, terror is always stronger than horror. Yeah, okay, the soundtrack suddenly getting loud, and the camera shaking while a monster growls like a mad demon can startle you and make your heart beat faster for a few seconds.\n\nBut terror. It can last even after you finished watching or reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountless times I was scared pissless after watching the show, to the point I used to run to my room, turn the light on, go back to the living room where the TV was, turn it and the light off, while the light in my room was on and the door open, protecting me, then run back to my room, turn the light off and dive into on my bed, covering me in the protective layer of my blanket.\n\nAnd during the entire process, the sensation of being watched from behind, or from the dark places where I couldn't see slowly creeping on me, intensifying with every moment of silence.\n\nThat's the power of terror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce watching these shows didn't have the same effect on me, and I finally got a computer, I started reading creepypasta. A lot of them.\n\nSome were scarier than others, but a small number of them caused something more other than terror in me. Curiosity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ones about urban exploration. There was something about them that made them different. More real. I mean yeah, a tall skinny guy with superpowers stalking you is creepy, but I don't really have any forest nearby, and have no good reason to visit the ones further away, let alone at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there were multiple abandoned places in my city. Some were surrounded by inhabited buildings, just waiting for someone to go inside and discover its secrets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't long until I joined a group of randos who were doing urban exploration.\n\nIt started off really lame, honestly. Most of them didn't really wanna visit the good spots. And the few who did go visit more interesting places were either idiots, or cosplayers wanting to take pictures. Why did I say idiots? Because apparently they either don't understand that going to these places is tresspassing, or don't give a fuck about being caught by the police. Which we got caught, multiple times, thanks to them. Luckily, I was very polite, and good at lying, the few of us that were better at lying always put on a surprised face, and said something along the lines of \"But, officer, we didn't know it was illegal to enter! We only wanted to take a few pictures.\" while pointing at the cameras the cosplayers had. Bullshit. We all -most-, knew it was illegal.\n\nThey always just went like \"Alright. I won't fine you, but you have to leave immediately.\", after which we left for a while, turned around and went back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning, it was so boring I almost regretted ever attempting to do urban exploration. How I wish that regret kept me from going further.\n\nAt first all we saw was graffiti, and a little bit of rubble.\n\nBut as the group started visiting more distant and obscure locations, and the group shrank, things got increasingly interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe visited an abandoned hospital that didn't manage to get fully built for one reason or another. Some parts didn't even have walls, only floor and some pillars for support. Other places almost looked completed. Those were the darkest and coldest spots in the entire building.\n\nSome of the walls and floors collapsed, and sealed one of the lower sections of the hospital. From one of the holes on the floor, you could peer down into the abyss. It was so deep you couldn't see the bottom, but I was sure as hell there was a basement down there,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I couldn't visit the hospital with them, but they went anyway. That day they found a crawlspace beneath the rubble and debris, and on the other side, a damp, dark basement. These guys were not the most stealthy because when they all crawled to the other side they found lit candles arranged in a circle, and some strange symbols on the ground, but whoever lit those candles either left, or hid from them.\n\nJust my luck. When things were finally getting interesting I had to be sick and couldn't go. Great.\n\nAt least that's what I thought back then when I still had...no. Focus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is that, after a couple more incursions that didn't yield any more adrenaline, this group fell apart. It doesn't matter why. Their drama didn't ever matter to me anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I still didn't have enough. This was the closest I ever got to any real adventure, and I was still forced to watch it from a screen, because I was sick that day.\n\nI couldn't stop now. Not after being so close. So of course I did what any self respecting teenager with a taste for terror and risk would and I assembled another group to explore with.\n\nWe were; Mark, a basketball player with a taste for the paranormal. He wanted to explore abandoned places to hopefully one day get evidence of the paranormal. Bob, a short, skinny introvert who was into the occult and wanted to start doing urban exploration with us. Yuhao, a large, muscular dude, Mark's friend, he just wanted to hang out. Bernie, all out thrill seeker that liked to do skydiving and climbing when he wasn't exploring. He wanted us all to explore at night. Hank, the voice of reason. He had a beard an a cool scar on the left side of his forehead. He said the scar was from a wolf attack while he was camping. He still hasn't told us the full story. He was the most responsible of us all. He always brought a first aid kit, a couple of flares, and a taser, just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the squad assembled, the veterans knew the perfect location for us, since it was quite close, and it was right at the edge of a small town, next to a restaurant and a factory, so we could get help if anything happened. But they were interested in visiting too, since they heard some really interesting stories about the place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was an abandoned slaughterhouse. Well, not exactly abandoned, anyway, as we would later find out.\n\nThe slaughterhouse was comprised of two buildings and a very large field, where all the pigs were once held. The field literally looked like a battlefield. It had walls of sandbags and there were what looked like empty shells all over the place. The veterans told us that the field and the building closest to us were being used to hold airsoft games. That was really cool because they had a shed with mannequins, toy swords, toy batons, toy grenades and fake swat shields made of plastic, so we logically left those in the shed, trying not to get caught by the factory workers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was obviously a lie, we used them and dueled each other for hours!\n\nWe spent so long playing with the toys, beating the mannequins, throwing plastic grenades at each other and whacking each other with soft sticks that it got late, quickly. Time flies when you're having fun, eh?\n\nNow we couldn't even explore the first building properly.\n\nBut I didnt mind, we had a good time, and we were certain we'd go back to the slaughterhouse soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext time we visited, we did some real exploration. It wasn't really that interesting. The airsoft guys made sure their playground was safe and clean. No dust, no rubble, nothing. There were no doors, and no windows, sunlight was flooding the entire building and it was HOT that day. The pretend battlefield outside, and the building looked exactly like a Counter Strike map. There were plenty of places to hide in, plenty of ways to ambush people. I did hear some skittering, but I figured it was probably a street dog that was spending the day there and got scared away.\n\nWe did find a makeshift bed, tucked away in one of the most remote corners of the building. It was obvious some homeless guy was sleeping there at night. The bed was \"hidden\" behind a wooden railing covered in a mosaic of torn fabric of all colors.\n\nLuckily, there was no one there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real fun began when we explored the second building.\n\nThe pretend battlefield ended at the far wall of the first building. There was a fence separating the battlefield from the other building. \n\n\"There must be another way\" said Yuhao.\n\n\"Let's try to find a door in the first building\" Bernie replied, \"Surely there is a way to reach the other building.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had to walk through what looked like the place where they killed the pigs. The floor was slightly inclined, and at the center of the room was what looked like a drain, leading to a small canal that looked like it was built to guide the blood to the outside, towards the second building.\n\nAnd at the far end of the room, the back door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBob remarked that \"This place reeks of spectral energy.\", to which Mark quickly responded \"I hope we see a ghost today.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we entered the first building through the main door, it was incredibly hot and sunny, and the memories of playing with the shields and swords the other day almost made us forget that this place used to be a slaughterhouse. But when we went out through the back it was as if the sun was hiding from us. It also got significantly cooler.\n\nThe ground was covered in debris. There was an abandoned pick up truck, paint long fallen off, only a rusted carcass without tires left of it. It was loaded with plastic canisters, the stickers indicating their contents where probably disintegrated by rain a long time ago.\n\nIt was unreal. It was like they were two different properties, with two different owners and maintainers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, and without warning, Bernie started to play with one of the canisters as if it was a soccer ball.\n\n\"Jesus, man, we don't know what was, or even is in those canisters! Be a little more careful.\" Hank scolded Bernie.\n\n\"What? Afraid of a little acid, or some lubricant staining your jacket?\" replied Bernie.\n\n\"Naw man, just don't go around touching everything you see before making sure it's safe.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of us had to work together to push the cold metal door open. Why did a slaughterhouse have 4 inch thick metal doors? The stark contrast between this and the other building hit us in the face like hammer. It was dark. Way darker than the previous building. Did it even have windows? I can't recall. It was also incredibly cool, despite the heat of the roaring sun outside. There was a weird smell in the air. At the time I couldn't identify it. To me, it smelled like a mix of char, chemicals, and weirdly enough, lavender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of us seemed to mind the temperature, in fact, I'm sure most of us liked it. We all turned on our flashlights and went inside. Fuck. We were so dumb. If only we knew what we were walking into.\n\nThe deeper we went, the darker it got. As soon as we entered, we stopped scaring each other for fun. It was actually a little bit more intimidating than we expected.\n\nWhen we reached the main hallway, it was pitch black. We were all pointing our flashlights down the hallway, trying to see what was inside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to go inside first. I obviously had to. Not only that, I was so brave and so great I went with my flashlight off. I don't even know what I was trying to prove. When the rest of the guys started following me into the hallway, I sped up a little. Wouldn't want some company in the pitch black darkness of an abandoned slaughterhouse huh?\n\nAnd of course, when I saw a door in the middle of the hallway, the first, lonely door, after a long walk through the hallway, I had to go inside. Alone. No one even saw me go in there. At the other side of the door were stairs leading up, and a bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bathroom was really boring. It was stripped of sinks and mirrors long ago, and only had one toilet left.\n\nI admit it, I pissed in the toilet. Shameless? Maybe a bit.\n\nThen I went up the stairs. While I was going up, I remembered the stories the veterans heard about this place. It used to be owned by some rich man, who was suspected of being a member of a satanic cult. He supposedly slaughtered humans too, in honor of Satan. Apparently, the man went insane after discovering that the local authorities were going to investigate his property. He burned down the place, and then went missing.\n\nBullshit. The slaughterhouse was standing alright. No signs of ever being burned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was absorbed by my thoughts, I realised how incredibly cold it got. I even had to put my jacket back on just to not start shivering. It was also deathly silent.\n\nAnd then, as I reached the second floor it hit me. The ground, the walls, probably even the ceiling if I could see it. Everything was charred. Everything was covered by a sheet of black substance, similar to burned skin. And the smell. It thickened so much I had to start breathing through my mouth just to escape the pungent smell of ash and lavender.\n\nTo this day I have no idea why I didn't just turn around and look for the others. No, I had to be the brave guy who went alone in the dark, of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, so that part of the story was true. Or at least there was a fire, at some point. And since the building is made of concrete and metal, with hardly any flammable materials anywhere, the fire didn't cover the entire building or destroy it.\n\nSo on I went, deeper into the dark. It was even darker now that the concrete walls were covered in black char.\n\nI found another thick metal door that was left ajar, so luckily I didn't have to push it and get my hands dirty to check what was on the other side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I wiggled my way inside, the cold became really hard to endure. It was apparently a refrigeration room. Probably where they kept the...pigs...after they were slaughtered. The fact that one part of the story was true didn't mean it was all true. People make things up all the time. I didn't manage to go too far into the char covered refrigeration room before I heard it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod, that sound. It still haunts me to this day. It was a mix between the gurgling croak of a raven, and human laughter. It was jarring, loud, and sudden. I really wasn't prepared for that. Anything but that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have no idea where I got all my courage from that day, but my adrenaline kicked in real fast, and my instinct was to act natural, as if I didn't hear anything and as if I wasn't interested in that room anymore. I got out of the refrigeration room the same way I got in, then I started walking, only slightly faster than before, towards where I thought I came from.\n\nI couldn't let whatever made that sound know I was scared, or even acknowledge it. I had to remain calm and act as if I didn't even know it was there.\n\nOh but it knew I heard. It definitely knew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe terror really got to me despite my best efforts to hide it, since I clearly wasn't going exactly the way I came from. Instead, after going down **some** stairs, I reached one of the only rooms with a wooden door. The room had a large metal sign with the \"Hazardous materials\" symbol on it. The one that looked like three intertwined curves with the tips sticking out. Look, I'm no expert. You know what symbol that is.\n\nAgain, my stupid primate brain had to investigate, instead of bolting the fuck out of there. The room was full of empty plastic canisters, all with the same symbol on them, as well as the skull and the little flame symbol, which I think means \"flammable materials\". The canisters had strange chemical names I didn't even know, and were all empty. What did I walk into? Was I going to get intoxicated for being in that room?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I couldn't stop and think, I remembered what I was running from. I managed to get back to the hallway, from a different door entirely. I could only see Mark there. The relief I felt was enormous.\n\nStill walking only a little faster than usual, I went towards him and said \"Hi.\", I then made a gesture for him to follow me, and we went to the other side of the hallway, where there was anothe metal door to the outside.\n\nThere, I finally got the courage to acknowledge what just happened. I told all of them what I heard, I told them about the char, and the weird chemicals. I then said the sound was probably just a bird, that got there to hide from the heat of the sun, and my mind only exaggerated the sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWishful thinking that was. But still, Hank and Mark decided to follow me back there, see for themselves. When we arrived there, the char was still there, the empty canisters of strange, toxic chemicals were still there. But in the refrigeration room there was nothing. Nothing at all. We searched every corner. Which wasn't hard since the room was completely empty, save for one ligth that was hanging from a cable from the ceiling, and was really close to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we confirmed there was nothing there, we decided to go back down, but from a different direction.\n\nSince I was secretly desperate to get out of there, I was in the front. It made me feel safe knowing the boys were behind my back. The fact that the char on the walls was beginning to fade was also really good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut of course, my lucky day wasn't over just yet. Of course not. I couldn't help but notice there was another big door, or rather, doorway this time. The metal door was resting on the concrete wall next to the doorway, which was crudely blocked by a few wooden planks and a barrel.\n\nTo me, it was obvious someone placed them there to purposedly make it look like the entrance was locked, but the planks were really light and easy to move, and the barrel was empty.\n\nOn the other side, was a huge, empty room. Well, empty, except for the chair in the middle. Oh, and the circle of candles all around the chair, forming a pentagram like shape. There were also multiple glyph like marks on the ground. Great, this part of the story was also true.\n\nAt least this time the candles weren't lit, like when the previous group found them in the hospital basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly called the other two guys, who followed me inside, where the smell of lavender impregnated everything. I wasn't prepared for what awaited me in the middle. On the chair, and on the ground around the chair, was a small pool of blood. Not like, a few drops, or maybe a handful of large stains of blood.\n\nNo.\n\nOne. Single. Pool.\n\nOne pool of blood that was still red and fresh, as if whoever or whatever bled on that chair did so not too long ago.\n\nThat was it. After this, we gathered everyone and left immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that day I learned an important urban exploration lesson. Don't go anywhere alone. Even if there turns out to be no danger there, you'll save yourself a lot of fear and anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh how I wish this was the end of it. I wish this was the only, or at least the worst story I had to share. But my great luck didn't end there, oh no. I'll post again soon.",

        "text": "\nI don’t know why I went to her wedding. I don’t even know why I was invited. But when I got the envelope in the mail, with  the expensive paper and delicate calligraphy, I felt like I couldn’t say no.\n\nMaybe Olivia was sending it out of politeness to me, or maybe it was just pity, but I checked the box next to “I will attend” and the box next to “vegetarian option” and I mailed it back.\n\nEverybody I told it about said it was a bad idea and I shouldn’t go. What’s the worst that could happen, I said. \n\nMark, my roommate, said I should just throw the envelope away. You keep doing the same thing. You gotta let her go, he said. You’re in a loop.\n\nI don’t like her anymore, I said and he rolled his eyes. \n\nSure, dude. \n\n*********\n\nI could have brought someone with me, but in the end I decided to go alone. It wasn’t entirely a bad thing. Being by yourself at a grand event really allows you to level up to a cinematic level of sadness. I always yearned to be a maudlin figure, alone in a crowd, or romantically wondering about on moors. Wuthering through some fucking heights  He looks so sad, a pretty girl would say from across the room, staring at me. Then maybe we’d fall in love. Or, baring that, at least sleep together. \n\nThe wedding was at an hour away, at a newly built church across the street from a strip mall. There was zero sense of the divine. \n\nI arrived a few minutes before it began, sat on the bride’s side, and instantly regretted my decision to attend. \n\nI recognized friends of Olivia’s I hadn’t seen since we broke up. Her family in the front row. Her brother and I made eye contact and he nodded, stiffly. \n\nThe Once and Future Husband — beaming, tall —stood at the front of the church. His friends surrounded him. All wore pink ties and their hair was immaculately, obsessively gelled and parted. The bridal party stood to the left. Olivia’s best friends, lined up in order of emotional closeness. Their dresses made them look ugly. \n\nThe music started and she walked down the aisle with her father and then she stood in front of everyone and the priest repeated magic words  and her and the Once and Future Husband kissed and everyone applauded and I wondered why I was even there. \n\n*******\n\nAfterwards, at the reception, I was at a table with a few people I didn’t know, drinking white wine. Whenever I looked up I thought I could see her dad or mom turning away from staring at me. I couldn’t help but feel like they were watching me, that I was here for some kind of reason, something I didn’t understand. \n\nI took another drink of my wine, checked the time on my phone, thought about when I could leave, and when I looked up and she was standing in front of me, smiling. \n\n“Do you want to dance?” she asked. \n\n“Of course,” I said. What else could I say. \n\nWe danced under the Instagram friendly exposed light bulbs to an old American Football song. The DJ was playing stuff we used to listen to all the time, The Replacements and Beach House and Real Estate. I thought of the Once and Future Husband listening to them with her. \n\n“This is nice,” I said. \n\n“Thanks. It’s costing my dad a fortune.” \n\n“That sucks.” \n\n“It’s fine,” she said. “He’s happy.”\n\n“He likes the Once and Future Husband?”\n\n“He does.”\n\n“More than he liked me,” I said. \n\nOlivia shrugged. “He doesn’t like a lot of people.” \n\n“I know.” \n\nShe laughed and we danced. Everyone seemed to be looking at us, but when I traced the trajectory of their glances it was really just at her. \n\n“I watched The Graduate last night,” I said and she began laughing again, a helpless unending giggle. \n\n“I didn’t watch it to help me plan how to break up your wedding. Mark put it on.” \n\n“Mark’s a real card,” she said. \n\n“I know.” A few seconds of silence. The song was nearly over. \n\n“So, you weren’t planning on banging on the doors, screaming my name, dragging me out?” She stared at me, blue eyes luminous. \n\n“No. Should I?” \n\nShe smiled. “I was thinking about that movie the other day. The party scene? Where the guy tells Dustin Hoffman’s character the secret of the future?”\n\n“Yeah, of course,” I nod. “Plastics.” \n\n“Exactly. Back then, plastic was going to change the world. The future was fake but it was a future. A plastic one. Now, look at us: plastic is in the ocean, in our stomachs, in the rain that falls. This -“\nshe touched my tie. “is polyester. Polyester is made out of plastic. And plastic leaks microplastics everywhere. The whole world is going to be plastic, and a million million years from now, when plastic is sentient and the apex species on earth, it will have hazy myths of humans as the gods that created them — and died from them.”\n\nThe song ended. She let go first. \n\n“Be careful, Tim. Get something real in this world and hold onto it.” \n\n***********\n\nI walked out of the hotel where the reception was still happening into the parking lot. The night air was cool from those late summer breezes off the lake and the trees were dark shadows, silently watching. Noises trailed in and out of the building and I saw other guests making their way to cars. My pink and white checked tie was loosened and I carried my blue suit jacket draped over my arm. \n\nNobody was parked around my car. When I had pulled in, a few hours ago, the whole lot was packed; now there were less than thirty cars.\n\nAs I walked, I began to get the feeling that someone was following me. \n\nWho would do that, I thought, trying to walk quieter, trying to see if I could hear other footsteps. Nobody would be following me. I didn’t want to turn around, because that’s a ridiculous thing to do. Nobody is behind you, I told myself. Or even if it is, it’s only another guest from the wedding. \n\nI could swear I heard breathing. \n\nI stopped walking. Froze entirely. No noise behind me. I looked. \n\nOnly an empty parking lot. \n\nI went to my car, turned it on. Music came up that reminded me of her and I turned off the stereo. Just drive home, I thought. Just go. \n\nI pulled out of the parking lot and as I turned onto the main road I saw the headlights of a car in the parking lot flick on. Then they appeared behind me, glowing white in my rear view mirror. Just somebody else leaving, I thought. \n\nOut onto the streets, past the forgettable rows of mid-price family restaurants, past where you could pick up the interstate, past where the old mall was before they tore it down, the whole way I could see the headlights in my mirror like cold, dead eyes staring. \n\nWas it a cop? How many glasses of wine did I have? Two, right? Two and that was with dinner. \n\nOr was it three? \n\nThe road was long and dark, just two lanes out there, in the liminal space between one suburban sprawl and  another suburban sprawl. This was the dead zone in between: spread out houses and curving streets and old woods on either side of the road. \n\nNobody out there but me and the car form the parking lot, still following, a little too close. \n\nA street sign came up, on my right. It looked like a residential street. A neighborhood. I thought about turning. If I turned, and the car turned in behind me, I’d know if was following me. If it didn’t, I was just being paranoid and everything was fine. \n\nI got closer. Should I turn? Did I want to know? \n\nAt the last second I clicked on my turn signal and made a hard, sharp right. \n\nI drove into the unknown and slowed down, my heart pounding. I was staring in my rearview, barely even driving. Bright headlights filled my car and then ...\n\nThey disappeared. The car that had been behind me drove away, still on the road we both had been. I exhaled and turned forward, getting ready to turn my car around and get back home, when I almost hit the girl standing in the middle of the road.\n\nI slammed on the brakes. \n\nShe was wearing sunglasses and a white sweater and a white fluffy dress, like she was going to a dance. Even though my car had stopped only a few feet away from her, she hadn’t moved. Just stood there, alone, brown hair tumbling down to her shoulders, holding a white purse. \n\nI stared for a moment, too dazed to get out. My headlights illuminated her like a spotlight, making it startlingly clear there was no one around. The houses on the rad were set far back from the street, dark and silent.\n\nFinally, I was able to move. I waved but got no reaction. She only stared straight ahead. \n\nGlancing back in my rearview I saw no cars, no lights, no signs of life. Breathing deeply, I opened the door. \n\n“Hello,” I called. My voice echoed. “Are you ok?” \n\nNo response, but at least she looked at me. Had she been in an accident? Was she concussed? No signs of trauma, though. Any blood would have shown on her dress.  \n\nMoths danced in and out of the lights glowing all around her.\n\n“Do you need help?” I couldn’t tell how old she was. Probably seventeen or eighteen. She didn’t speak. Just stared at me. \n\n“You could have gotten yourself killed,” I said as I walked to her. “Why were you standing in the street?”\n\n“I need help,” she finally said — at least I think she spoke, but now I can’t quite remember how her voice sounded. \n\n“Are you lost?” \n\nShe nodded. \n\n“I can drive you home, if you want.” \n\n“It’s not far,” she said and the next thing I knew we were both back in my car. She was sitting in the backseat, I was in the front. \n\n“Where do you live?” I asked, disoriented. \n\n“Not far,” she said. “I’ll tell you when to turn.” \n\nI looked at her in the rearview mirror. Her purse was on the seat beside her and she was looking out at the trees and houses like she had never seen them before. The strange emptiness of her earlier expression was gone. Now there was almost a hunger in her face, an unmistakeable joy. The world reflected against the black of her glasses. We drove down the winding back streets in silence, going further and further into a neighborhood I had never been in. It felt dreamlike and strange and I rolled the window down, let in the night air. \n\n“Is it around here?” \n\n“Almost there,” she said. There was a weird catch in her voice. \n\n“Where?” I asked, but she didn’t answer. I looked in the rearview but she was gone. \n\nThere was nobody there. \n\nI spun around halfway in my car seat, shouting. The doors were closed. She was gone. I heard a strange noise, and my car jerked forward. I hadn’t stopped the car, I realized. I spun around and saw my car had run off the road. There was a tree coming straight at me. \n\nI jerked the wheel to the left but not fast enough: the car slammed into the tree. An airbag exploded from my steering wheel and the car was filled with its strange vacuum packed smell. I looked back. She was still gone. \n\nI got out of the car and looked at the front hood. It was damaged, but not too bad. I could probably drive it home. I circled to the rear of the car, pressed my face face against the window. Had I just imagined the girl? That seemed impossible, but everything about her had seemed unreal. Maybe I had imagined the whole thing. Maybe the wine at the wedding was laced with DMT and the machine elves would be here soon. \n\nThat’s when I noticed the white purse on my back seat. \n\nI opened the door and took it out. It was real. Cold to the touch. Plastic. \n\n*Almost there*, she had said. \n\nI looked around at the semi-deserted road and saw, set off the street, a small little house. \n\nWe were almost there. \n\nStill holding the purse I walked across the street. \n\nThe house was dark and quiet, a mid century bungalow. No porch, just a little walkway to a slightly raised concrete step. A doormat with flowers on it. There was a light on and it turned the night soft and  yellow all around it. \n\nI rang the bell and stood, feeling suddenly like an idiot. What if I was wrong? \n\nA man opened the door. He was looked to be in his early fifties, wearing slacks and a button up shirt, freshly shaved with his hair combed. He looked like he was waiting for me. \n\nI saw his eyes move up and down, then stop at her purse. \n\n“You met her,” he said. “Why don’t you come in.” \n\n*****\n\nHe put tea on and we went into the living room. He had been waiting for me or somebody like me. It happened on the same day every year. was Courtney’s father — that was the girl’s name. The girl in white who had vanished. Courtney. \n\nHe hadn’t said ghost. He had used words like ghost — appearance, vision, image. Stuff like that. But never ghost. As I sat on his floral print couch in his sparsely decorated living room, I began to tell myself that the only word to describe her was the word he wasn’t saying. \n\nShe was a ghost. \n\nThe teapot whistled and he excused himself. While he padded off to go pour us two mugs, I stared at the room. A piano in the corner. Bookshelves with big coffee table books on them: histories of jazz and brutalist architecture and Weegee crime scene photos. Against one wall was a tapestry with a drawing on it, a figure wrapped in sheets in a field, birds flying down all around it. \n\nAnd, of course, photos of Courtney. \n\nCourtney on the wall in frames and under glass, smiling from senior portraits and photo shoots. She looked exactly like the girl in my car. \n\nI stood and walked closer to one. I was staring at her face. What had happened to her? What was happening to her now? \n\n“Here is your tea,” Courtney’s father said. I spun around to see him putting the teacup down in its little plate on the wooden coffee table. He was breathing heavily. \n\n“Thank you,” I said, sitting down. “Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine,” he said. He made it to his chair and sat heavily in it, massaging his temples. “I try to act like this is nothing, that I’m so used to it but...” he looked up, gave a weak smile. “It takes a toll.” \n\n“I can go,” I started to say but he was saying no, don’t go, at the same time. He motioned for me to sit. I settled back onto the couch, waiting for him to talk. He took a deep breath and began. \n\n“Ten years ago. There was a school dance. Courtney wanted to go, but she was grounded.”\n\n“Why?” I don’t know why I asked. He looked surprised too, like he hadn’t been expecting me to say that. \n\n“She was dating a guy I didn’t like. Seems dumb now, that I was so upset. But I didn’t like him. Didn’t think he was good enough for her. He was going to take her, but I said no. She snuck out. Was waiting for him in the street when —“\n\nHe starts to cry, just a little. He wipes his eyes, clears his throat. \n\n“Excuse me. I just feel responsible, still. If I had just let her go, none of this would have happened.”\n\n“You can’t blame yourself,” I say. “Things are sometimes just messed up. It’s not always someone’s fault.”\n\n“Sometimes, though, I think it is,” he’s staring at me and I fell strange. I reach up and grab my head. \n\n“Are you alright?” His voice sounds far away. \n\n“Yeah, I hit my head in the car. I’m okay, I think.” \n\n“That’s good. The car.” He takes a drink. The tea darkens the white of his mustache that touches it. “She was standing there. A car came out of nowhere and slammed into her. They never found the driver.” \n\n“God, that’s horrible,” I say. My drink is done and the room and what is happening is beginning to feel claustrophobic. The pictures on the wall. The tapestry on the wall seemed to pulse. It looked like the birds were flying. \n\n“Whoever it was didn’t stop,” the man says. “He just kept driving. Left her to die on the street. Her spine was broken. Her eyes weren’t there when we found her the next morning. She was paralyzed. They think an animal ate her eyes as she was dying.”\n\n“Jesus,” I said because I can’t think of anything else to say. \n\n“Drove away,” he said. I saw spit connecting his upper and lower lips. His teeth are decaying. “Can you imagine doing that to anyone?”\n\n“No, God, no. How could anyone do that?”\n\nThere’s a pause, a long moment. He’s staring at me, breathing heavily. I’m starting to worry he’s having a stroke when he shakes his head. \n\n“I don’t know.” \n\nThe big clock in the room dings, loud and menacing. He looks over at it. \n\n“Eight o’clock. That’s when she died.”\n\nI felt helpless and strange. “This has to be really difficult for you…”\n\n“It would kill most people to go through something like that,” he said. The lights in the room gave him a pale, waxy look. He was breathing heavily and his hands were shaking. “If you saw your daughter like that it would kill you.” \n\n“I’m sorry, I should go,” I said, standing up in the chair. The room was making me feel claustrophobic. “Let me give you the purse at least -“ \n\nI stop. I had left the purse on the table in front of me, but now it was gone. I looked behind me, at the chair, and at the ground. \n\n“I just had it,” I said. “Where could it have gone?”\n\n“It never stays,” he said. “Just like her.”\n\n\n*****\n\n\nI walked out of his house and to my car. It seemed fine, mostly. I backed it up, out onto the street. No other cars around. I looked at the house and all of the lights were dark. \n\n“He must have been waiting for that,” I said. “Now he’s going to bed.”\n\n“Do you think that’s it?”\n\nI jumped in my seat, spinning around. I expected to see her but there was no one. My heart was racing. I put the car in park and stepped out, walked all around, opened the back doors. Nothing. \n\nI exhaled, pushed my hair back from my face. It had been warm but the night was getting cold. The sweat on my forehead was ice temperature. \n\nGetting back in the car, I slammed the drivers side door. I really wanted to get out. I felt sick, overwhelmed. Pressing the gas I drove off and then stoped. \n\nShe was standing in the middle of the road but now her white dress was all red and her eyes were missing. \n\nMy headlights illuminated and went through her at the same time. She was transparent. I could drive right through her. She waved, her neck permanently crooked. \n\nThe radio was making a noise, I thought, but then I realized it was just me, screaming. \n\nShe walked right toward me, slow halting steps. White dress dragged on the ground. Blood all over her purse. \n\nI wanted to accelerate, drive right through her, but I couldn’t, I didn’t want to hurt her. \n\nI closed me eyes but I knew she was still in front of me. \n\nJust drive, I thought. Just drive. You can’t kill her again. She’s already dead. \n\nWithout opening my eyes I gunned the car. \n\nI rushed straight ahead and I felt something strange and soft like a spider web. For a moment I thought I wasn’t going to get out and then it seemed to rip and the car was going straight again. \n\nI opened my eyes. Nothing in front of me but suburban houses, lawns, sidewalks, all lit up in the soft glow of my headlights. \n\nStarting to breath again, I looked in my rear view. No sign of her. Not in front of me either. I looked around trying to find a way out of the neighborhood that didn’t lead back there. \n\nI turned down one street and another, turned my radio on but it was just static. \n\nThen I heard a voice from the back seat. \n\n“You don’t know why you’re here, do you?”\n\nI stopped driving. \n\n“Keep going,” the voice said. “I’ll get you out.” It sounded wet. Dripping. I couldn’t look in the rearview. I didn’t want to see it there on the black seats. The girl with the missing eyes. \n\n“Why are you doing this?” I started driving again. \n\n“Why am I doing this?” She sounded amused, almost. “Turn left.”\n\nI turned. “What do you want?”\n\n“The same thing everybody wants,” she said. “Justice in an unjust world.”\n\n“Do you want me to find who hit you?”\n\nShe started to laugh and I trailed off. \n\n“Sure, I’d love that,” she rasps. “Do you have any clues? Any guesses?”\n\n“How am I supposed to have any clues? I’ve never met you?”\n\n“You haven’t?” \n\nWe pulled up at a stop sign and I felt sick. \n\n“Turn right.”\n\nWe drove in silence. The houses seemed to repeat. They looked like teeth in an infinitely consuming mouth. \n\n“Where are we going?”\n\n“To know where we’re going you have to know where you’ve been.”\n\nShe’s in the passenger seat next to me. I can smell the rot of her. How can I smell her when she isn’t solid, I think. How can something exist in two different places? \n\n“What did you do today, Timmy?”\n\n“I went to a wedding,” I said, not looking at her. \n\n“Didn’t it seem familiar?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean, did it feel like the first time you were there? Or did it feel like you’ve been there a million times? Go straight here.” \n\n“It felt like a wedding, I don’t know. What do you want me to say?” The car is gliding. Above us, clouds roll endless over the dark sky. She shakes her head. \n\n“I always think you’ll remember. You never do,” she says. She touches the radio, turns off the static. Her window rolls down. \n\n“What am I supposed to remember?”\n\n“You had four glasses at the wedding, Tim. Plus a shot at some point. You got lost on your way home. Thought a cop was following you. Turned down a side street. There was a girl standing in the middle of the road. You never saw her. I can’t see anything anymore either, Tim.” She turns and i look at  her, at the holes in her face. The black looked like the universe. Unknown, unimaginable, cold. “I know exactly how you felt.” \n\n“Something is wrong —“ I said. \n\n“Drive faster,” she responded. I pushed down on the gas pedal. \n\n“I’m going too fast.”\n\n“Faster.”\n\n“What did I do?”\n\n“You don’t get it?”\n\nFlashes of images. Flares of white. Something hitting my car. Impact. Lights. \n\n“It wasn’t — I didn’t do that. Did I? I couldn’t have?”\n\nShe started to laugh. \n\n“You drove right through me. The last thing I saw. With human eyes. Keep driving.” Her voice gets stranger. “Faster.”\n\n“How could I have done that but be here now?”\n\n“It isn’t now.”  \n\n“I don’t understand what is happening,” I screamed The car was shaking. “What happened?”\n\n“You went to a wedding. Then you hit me with a car and killed me. Now, every day you will go to a wedding. Every day you will see me again. Tomorrow we’ll meet here, again.” She grins. Her smile is bloody. \n\n“How many times have you driven down this road, Tim?”\n\nThe white of her dress is the same white of the headlights in front of me.",

Past the potholes, rusted-out cars, and abandoned buildings; the symptoms of a town growing old. As a cold September rain washed over us, we found our way back to the corner pub where we’d first met. We stopped to grab a bite and rest up. It’d been a long day.\n\nJohn ordered three beers for himself. I settled for a plate of fries and a coke. He leaned back and pulled a long strand of hair from his head. There was barely any resistance; it practically fell off.\n\n“Bad timing,” he sighed.\n\n“Didn’t know hair loss was a thing in our family,” I smiled.\n\n“It isn’t,” said John without looking up. “But as I’m sure you’ve noticed, I’m not exactly a paragon of health.”\n\n“You’ve never told me what it does to you, you know. Whatever that is.”\n\n“I didn’t?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn chugged one of his beers and thought about it for a minute. Once he was sure we were alone, he lowered his voice.\n\n“Remember that sludge you got infected with? That was a sort of an… unrefined metal goo. Same stuff that Hatchet made Blameless out of.”\n\n“Sure,” I nodded. “Why not.”\n\n“I’ve told you about how Hatchet refined it. Made stuff with it. Computer components mostly. But Blameless, it… it wants to spread. To reach out.”\n\nHe rubbed the back of his head, squirming a bit in his seat.\n\n“Someone at Hatchet got the bright idea to make bullets. Full metal jacket, coated with Blameless. They had no idea what it would do, but they did it anyway, despite all the ballistics showing that it was useless. There was only about… 20 bullets made before they stopped production. But instead of throwing them out or repurposing them, they were issued to standard security personnel. ‘Cause why the hell not.”\n\n“Bullets?” I scoffed. “So what did-“\n\nI thought about it as John rubbed his neck.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Yeah,” he nodded. “You don’t just quit Hatchet. They take you out back, Old Yeller style. Except the guy who did it to me had one of the Blameless bullets.”\n\n“They shot you?!”\n\n“Execution style. Still got that sucker lodged in my cerebellum. That refined Blameless is the only thing keeping me alive, but by God, does it mess you up.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Speaking of messing up.”\n\nWe both turned around.\n\nThe woman standing next to us had popped up out of nowhere, leaning against our booth with a cheeky grin. It was my old landlord, Leah. The one who owned the building where I’d first stayed when I got to Tomskog. A woman in her late 40’s with one of the widest smiles I’d ever seen. Immaculate white teeth, and an almost unnaturally perfect face. Uncannily gorgeous woman.\n\nShe and John seemed acquainted with one another. Well enough for her to push him aside and sit down at our booth, grabbing one of his three beers. John didn’t protest.\n\n“Glad to see you’re still around, Maryland,” she smiled at me. “Got any sexy new scars?”\n\n“Yeah, no. And that’s not my name.”\n\n“That’s where you’re from, isn’t it? I can smell it, you know.”\n\nShe gave me a little wink and turned her attention to John, who seemed to slowly sink into the floor.\n\n“Little John, the merriest of men. My dear brother told me he’d spotted a bit of smoke rising from your chimney.”\n\n“Yeah,” John nodded. “Burned it all to the ground.”\n\n“Oh dear. What a predicament.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe sipped her beer and slid the glass over to me. I was about to pick it up, like it’d been a gift, but John just subtly shook his head. I got the impression that I shouldn’t accept anything freely given from this woman.\n\n“Well, if you boys need a place to stay until you get back on your feet, I’m sure we can figure something out.”\n\nJohn bit his lip and fully turned to her, his eyes flaring red.\n\n“What the fuck do you want, Leah?”\n\n“I want to help a-“\n\n“No. Stop that. Just fucking stop. Tell me what the *fuck* you want.”\n\nHer smile never faded. Not a hint of frustration, unease, or aggression. Like a smiling marble statue, and just as pale.\n\n“I could use the company, Little John.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce John talked her into leaving, we paid our bill and left. John got a new phone and started making calls while I waited on a park bench down by Frog Lake. Just sitting there, I could imagine the caves running far beneath the surface, under that drowned church. I wondered what would happen once this year was over. Would I make my way back here, one final time?\n\nJohn got increasingly angry. No one seemed able to help. He even considered taking us out of town, but that would mean asking Fred for a favor; and John wasn’t too keen on that idea. Instead, he plopped down next to me on the bench and sank his face into his hands.\n\n“I think we gotta take her up on her offer,” he sighed. “It’s not safe, but… the devil you know, and all that.”\n\n“Why isn’t it safe?”\n\n“The Babin family is a goddamn mess. All of them. I don’t know how, but however Hatchet fucked them did some serious damage. Class of 2000.”\n\n“She looks fine to me.”\n\n“Don’t ever be alone with her, or anyone from her family,” John said. “Promise me.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Promise me!”\n\nHe grabbed my jacket and pushed his fingers into my arm. I could feel him trembling, as if losing control of his fingers. One of his eyes twitched.\n\n“Okay. I promise.”\n\nHe put his arm around me and dialed a new number. His voice sank as he asked to speak to the landlord.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeah Babin was glad to help us out. She showed us an apartment in a different building closer to the town center, overlooking a gas station and a flower shop. A simple one-bedroom apartment. I was told I could take the bedroom, as John barely slept anyway. Besides, he’d be busy ‘paying dearly’ for renting that place, whatever that meant.\n\nIn the end, I ended up staying there alone most of the time. John was gone for days at a time, running errands and trying to keep up with his work. He brought back two laptops and some kind of wireless router. He also talked about keeping up with the treatment for the refined Blameless that ran through his system. Apparently, he needed some kind of medication, and his stash had been lost in the workshop fire.\n\nI could tell he was getting worse. His hair was falling out, leaving a big bald spot on the left side of his temple. He was rarely ever in the apartment, and when he was, he looked paler than usual. Whatever treatment he needed was clearly not working.\n\nThe worst example of this was when I was cleaning up in the living room, only to find a handful of teeth on the carpet. Unless those things grew out of the floor, John was having more trouble than he was letting on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe stayed there all through September, and John’s visits grew more infrequent. I had a lot of ideas on how to pass the time, but I ended up staying mostly inside. I went to the movies a few times, but the darkness made me so anxious that I couldn’t stay. I could imagine horrors waiting outside of view or sneaking up on me. I felt like I had this big target on my back, and I couldn’t relax. Being a Yearwalker, however, I’m sure that’s not too far from the truth.\n\nI didn’t see much of Leah Babin. John assured me that he was doing everything he could to make sure they left me alone. At least, that’s what he told me, and I intended to keep my promise not to be alone with any of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of October, a man moved into the apartment across the hall. Boxes being opened, furniture assembled, cleaning and decorating; the whole nine yards. I could smell the moving day pizza through the door. It was only four people in total, but they all seemed to be friends, and in good spirits. It was such a strange thing to see after all these months of living on the edge of a constant panic. Something so normal. And there I was, watching it play out through my peephole; like a fish-eyed TV show.\n\nAt some point, I could see the four of them standing in the hallway, talking to one another. Rock paper scissors. They seemed a bit anxious. One of them, a young college-aged woman, walked up to my door and rang the bell. She spoke out loud.\n\n“Hello! Sorry, do you think we could borrow a hammer?”\n\nThese weren’t the Babins. These were just people. I hadn’t been around regular people in quite some time. Of course they could borrow a hammer!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got to know the four of them pretty well. They were all studying to become veterinarians. I didn’t even know Tomskog had that kind of a program. The guy who moved in was Oliver, and his three friends were classmates; Erin, Vicky, and Kent. Erin was the friendly smile that lured me out with a hammer in the first place. I ended up helping Oliver move in; I even got a slice of the moving day pizza.\n\nOver the next week, I met the veterinarians three times. I came along to a café, we went to the pub, and we took a ride up to Mankato. For a while, I was the “nice neighbor”, and that was all I wanted to be. Not a Yearwalker, not a “Digman”. Just me. It was nice to be me for a while.\n\nOliver would knock on my door and just check in on me every now and then. Offer me leftovers, ask if I wanted something from the store. I explained to them that I had a sick uncle who I took care of, just to stop the questions about me staying inside so much. They didn’t question it. If anything, they admired me.\n\nI was quite fond of Oliver. He had a sad resting face, but a rare smile that could light up a room. He reminded me of Eeyore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery day at lunch, Oliver would go back to his apartment and get a snack from his kitchen. Sometimes he’d get one for me. It sort of turned into this routine, where he’d knock on my door at lunch and I’d walk over and sit with him for a while. Sometimes I’d get a sandwich, or a power bar.\n\nHe’d vent about his studies, and the stress of prepping for tests. The intricacies of everything from livestock hoofcare to administering anesthesia to house cats. There was always something going on in Oliver’s ordinary world, and even a glance at it gave me ideas of what to do once all of this was over. With a bit of help from John, I might be able to go to culinary school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the second Thursday of October when Oliver once again knocked on my door for lunch. I walked up to the door, opened it, and stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nThat wasn’t Oliver.\n\nJust inches from my face was a pale man, with oil-slick black hair. He had a hawk-like nose, and pupils that were so large and dark that his eyes looked black. Despite his awful posture, he was taller than me. He leaned against the doorframe with a casual pose, staring daggers at me.\n\n“Hi there,” he smiled.\n\nHis gums were beet red, and his teeth looked smaller than usual. A very odd-looking man overall. Gave me the creeps. He had this strange way of saying almost every ‘R’ with a rolling tongue.\n\n“I’m here about the light fixture,” he continued.\n\n“I didn’t call about a light fixture.”\n\n“You didn’t?”\n\nWithout a second thought, he placed a cold hand flat on my cheek and stared into my face. It was so sudden that I didn’t know how to react. He wasn’t doing anything outright threatening, but I felt like a gazelle being stared down by a lion. He did this uncomfortable gulping noise, like a cat getting ready to throw up.\n\n“Sorry,” he said. “Wrong door.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe backed away and stepped outside. He kept staring at me, not really letting the conversation end.\n\n“You’re John’s kid, right?”\n\n“And you are?” I asked.\n\n“Roy,” he said. “I fix things.”\n\nI remembered a Roy. Last time I lived in one of Leah’s apartments, and the bathroom was messed up, it was Roy who fixed it. I never met him personally, but he barely even charged me for it.\n\n“Right, Roy,” I nodded. “You’re with, uh… Leah?”\n\n“Her brother, yeah,” he grinned. “I thought John would, uh… would be staying here.”\n\n“Sometimes, yeah.”\n\n“But not now,” he nodded. “Right now it’s just you. All alone.”\n\nHe pointed at me with a pale hand, making finger guns.\n\n“Keep it cool, *kitten*.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that meeting, I got a bit more careful about opening the door. Roy started coming by every now and then, pretending to fix something in Oliver’s apartment. He seemed to look at the light from the peephole in my door; apparently, you can see when someone’s looking out at you. At least Roy could see it. He’d make that gulping sound and just stare at the peephole; like he was looking straight through the door. Sometimes he’d chuckle to himself, or mouth ‘hello’ at me. Or just gulp a little.\n\nSometimes, even if Oliver was the one knocking, I’d be reluctant to open. Roy would be standing at the end of the hallway, looking at us.\n\nApparently, Oliver wasn’t having these issues with him. It was just me.\n\nFigures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time John came over, he was looking worse. He wore an eye patch, and he had several cuts on his face. He had a brand-new pair of leather gloves, which he refused to take off. He only stayed for a couple of hours; just long enough to check his laptops, chug half a bottle of vodka, and leave. I tried telling him about Roy, but John just shook his head.\n\n“He won’t touch you,” he said. “Leah would tear his goddamn head off.”\n\nI wasn’t convinced. Roy seemed a little bit too eager to get to know me. He’d gotten so bold as to ring the bell at times, making sing-songy demands of letting him in to check the bathroom lights. It was the kind of tone where someone says they’re joking, but they’re not really joking.\n\nI wasn’t taking any chances. I knew that I’d walk into that living room to find him there someday, and I didn’t like that thought. Not one bit. So I started hiding weapons all over the place. A hammer taped to the bottom of a chair. A knife under the pillow. A crowbar next to the umbrella. I started putting up a chair against the door handle as I slept, so I’d at least delay someone trying to break in.\n\nOliver took notice, and he didn’t like it. He insisted that I’d talk to the landlord about it. It was hard to explain why I couldn’t, and why I wasn’t allowed to do so. I could only refer to a vague “arrangement” with my uncle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoy didn’t care either way, and his excuses were getting more ridiculous. At one point he didn’t even try; he just straight up asked me to let me in. That he wanted to keep me company.\n\nOne night, he’d been particularly persistent. I’d propped up pillows in my bed to make it look like I was sleeping, while I actually slept in the bathtub. I woke up to the sound of a key being slid into the door, and the chair being carefully pushed aside. The door opened slightly; just enough for him to peek into the living room.\n\nI’d hear that disgusting gulping noise over and over. He was excited.\n\n“Let’s be friends,” he whispered. “For a while.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided enough was enough, and the next day I asked to sleep on Oliver’s couch. He was confused but didn’t seem to mind.\n\nIt’d be nice to be around a normal person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that week, Oliver was having a belayed housewarming party. All the other veterinary students were invited, and some of their friends. A little over a dozen people in total.\n\nI helped Oliver prep for the party. I can make these insane bacon-wrapped water chestnuts in honey barbecue sauce that’s just to die for, and I made a whole tray of them. Oliver put up a little disco ball and shared a public playlist where people could add songs. All in the theme of animals.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly a costume party, but sticking to the theme was encouraged. Oliver, being keenly aware of me calling him Eeyore, made himself a tail with a pink ribbon and a little black tassel at the end. I painted my face with black spots around my eyes and called myself a panda.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a great party. It was amazing just how many people caught the Eeyore reference. People were getting fun-drunk, and not the kind of sad-drunk that I was used to. Midnight-wine-talk-in-the-kitchen drunk. Back-slapping “I love you man”-drunk. We had party games, karaoke, and a drinking game. One of the guys hadn’t seen “The Room”, so we put it on and took a shot every time he said any variation of ‘what?’. I got nine shots out of that, even after he made a conscious effort not to say it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust past midnight, the party was going strong. Some more people had joined, and I’d agreed to let the party extend to my place. Just so people could have a place to sit and talk, away from the music. Luckily, no one seemed to take note of my barely hidden weaponry.\n\nI was in the middle of a conversation with Vicky, all the way in the back of Oliver’s kitchen, when I saw her face suddenly going pale. I turned around, only to see Roy standing in the doorway.\n\n“I’m… I’m not sure you’re invited!” said Vicky, speaking over the music.\n\nRoy couldn’t hear her, and cocked his head to the side like an attentive dog. I swear I could hear something crack from his neck. He gulped a little. I couldn’t hear the gulp, but I could see it. I knew all too well what it looked like by now.\n\nHe stepped closer, and Vicky placed herself in-between us. She’d probably heard all about Roy from Oliver.\n\n“Hey!” she said. “You’re not invited, and I think you should leave!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took one step further, and Vicky put up a hand up to stop him. As soon as it touched his chest, he recoiled like he’d been shot. His eyes flared up, going dark, and he made a strange inhaling noise; like an inverse owl screech. He took heavy breaths and looked at Vicky with every little bit of hatred he could muster. I could’ve sworn he was going to attack her right then and there.\n\nInstead, he grabbed the kitchen door handle, tore it out, and dropped it on the floor. All while maintaining his eye contact with Vicky.\n\nI could hear people in the other room going quiet. And as Roy backed away, I could tell a line had been crossed. She’d touched him, and he clearly wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that night, things started to get weird. I’d wake up from things being thrown at the window, despite me staying at Oliver’s place. One morning, the front door was wide open, and there were muddy foot prints going all the way up to my couch. But the weirdest thing was the trash. Once when I came back from grocery shopping, Roy had been rifling through the trash; throwing it all out on the kitchen floor like some kind of scorned raccoon.\n\nSo when he suddenly stopped showing up, that’s when I got really worried.\n\nBy the end of October, there’d been a few days where I’d only seen Roy in passing. He hadn’t knocked, he hadn’t come by, and he hadn’t done anything weird. I’d even started sleeping back in my own apartment again. Everything seemed quiet. Too quiet, if anything.\n\nIt wasn’t until Oliver sat down to talk to me during one of his lunch breaks that it started to make sense.\n\nApparently, Vicky had gone missing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I had no evidence. No proof whatsoever. But every fiber of my being was screaming at me that this was somehow Roy’s work. Every time I looked at him, he gave me this knowing grin. I knew that fucker had something to do with it. But what the hell was I supposed to say?\n\nI couldn’t do anything, but Oliver was doing plenty. He’d called the police about Roy several times, but it didn’t lead anywhere. The Tomskog Police department didn’t seem bothered by the idea of a missing young woman and a suspected murderer. If anything, they brushed us off a little bit too quickly. Then again, even the police department had Hatchet watermarks on their printer paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoy had stopped bothering me, but he had turned to something far more sinister; bothering Oliver. I could hear Roy knock on his door and ask for him to come out.\n\n“Oh, Ooooooliver!” he’d cackle. “Wanna go for a *drinky-wink*?”\n\nAt one point, I got so frustrated that I grabbed the kitchen knife and pulled the door open.\n\nI was fully ready to murder this fucker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the *face* he made.\n\n***Jesus Christ.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing me with that knife brought the biggest, most unnaturally teethy smile to Roy’s face that I’d ever seen. Like the grin of a white shark coming out of a human face; his eyes went completely black. I could’ve sworn he grew a foot taller.\n\nAll the fight just ran out of me, but Roy was just getting started. He threw himself at me. I barely made it back inside, slamming the door shut. He started making little scratches, like a pleading cat. I could hear the texture of his hair as he rubbed his head against the door handle.\n\n“Come oooon!” he laughed. “Don’t be such a *widdle* *tease!*”\n\nHe had this manic laugh, that just kept going higher and higher; mixing into his excited gulping. Like a skipping record, stuck on the most horrifying screech imaginable.\n\nThat night, I kept trying to call John. I called him over, and over, and over. He didn’t pick up. I couldn’t stop shaking, and I could feel my heart all the way into my throat. There was no way Roy was gonna stop, and there was nothing I could do. I needed John. Or Evan. Or anyone who could understand.\n\nI didn’t want to say anything to Oliver, or his friends. I didn’t want to get them involved. Vicky was already missing, and it was my fault.\n\nFinally, I got a call back. An unknown number.\n\nIt could be John, using a new phone.\n\nOr Roy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked it up without saying anything, holding my breath.\n\nIt was John.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I can’t talk much,” he sighed. “Is this the about the Babins?”\n\n“He’s going. To kill me.”\n\n“He’s not. I promise you, he’s not.”\n\n“I’m not fucking around, John! He’s going to kill me!”\n\n“Fine. We’ll talk. Go outside in fifteen minutes, I got a car.”\n\nHe hung up on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose fifteen minutes were nerve-wracking. Roy was skulking around somewhere out there, but I couldn’t hear or see him anymore. Still, I wasn’t taking any chances. I wasn’t waiting outside any longer than I absolutely had to.\n\nOnce fifteen minutes had passed, I got a text, and I ran outside. I sprinted down the stairs, almost tripping against the railing. I got all the way down as fast as I could, shot through the front door, and stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*There was no car.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could feel a heat coming up behind me; creeping up my spine.\n\n“I’m pretty good with voices,” whispered John into my ear.\n\nBut it wasn’t John.\n\nJohn didn’t gulp like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething was wrapped around my face, and I was pushed to the ground.\n\nThen, nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up to the sound of whistling.\n\nI couldn’t feel my legs, and my hands were cold.\n\nUnderbrush scratched my face; I was being dragged through a forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“They… they said I can’t do it,” Roy muttered. “But I wanna do it. I wanna do it *so bad*.”\n\nThrough the haze, I saw black eyes looking down at me; like a pair of blackened full moons.\n\nEnormous. Looming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried grabbing something, but my fingers were too weak. I’d been drugged.\n\n“Just a little,” he continued. “Nothing *too* bad. I’m not a *monster*.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a clearing. Up on a hill, I could see the outlines of a small building. A shed, perhaps. And even then, in my delirious state, I could smell the most foul odor imaginable. Wet bone, a sickly-sweet sinew, and moldy flesh. I barely knew my own name, but every primal instinct in me told me I didn’t want to go there. Whatever was over there, was death. Certain, irrevocable death.\n\nRoy laid me down on my stomach, holding my arm. He playfully massaged my hand. My head happened to be on the side, looking up at him. I couldn’t even manage to beg.\n\n“I’m glad you came,” he smiled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe carefully put my ring finger in between his lips, savoring the sensation.\n\nAnd without me feeling a thing. \n\nAnd with no more sound than that of a snapping carrot.\n\n*He bit my finger off.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind *screamed*.\n\nI could feel my heart going haywire. I could feel blood rushing out of me, but there was no pain. I knew there should be. My legs flopped, struggling against my interrupted impulses.\n\nRoy just carefully stood up, leaned his throat back, and swallowed my whole finger with a gulp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to push myself back. I tried to roll over, to get away, to scream, to do something; but all that came out was a weak groan. Roy looked down on me with this mocking concern on his face.\n\n“Another one?” he smiled. “Well, if you *insist*, kitten.”\n\n“….no.”\n\nIt was all I managed to say before he lifted my hand back up towards his mouth. He put my index finger in, but he was too excited. I didn’t even feel anything, but I saw him cram my entire hand into his mouth; resting his razor-sharp teeth against my wrist.\n\nHe was so excited. His eyes were shaking, and he couldn’t stop smiling. His body was already gulping, like he was trying to swallow, like a baby bird.\n\n“…n-no.”\n\nThe words just got him more excited, like a playful animal. He bit down just a little, just to see if I’d feel it.\n\nI didn’t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe spat me out and got back up. He did a little dance, giddy with excitement. He couldn’t stop himself from laughing. This was his domain, and he had no trouble doing whatever he wanted out here. Like he’d done to Vicky.\n\n“Why didn’t we do this *sooner*?!” he cackled. “*This is so much fun!*”\n\nHe fell back down to his knees, running a finger along my spine.\n\n“I like marrow the most,” he smiled. “But just a little. Just enough for you to *feel* it, kitten.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, he stopped. His eyes sharpened, as he scanned the forest. I could see the trees sway back and forth in the wind, and feel that awful smell being whisked away.\n\nSomething moved in the trees.\n\nRoy carefully stood up, slowly looking around.\n\nAnd something swooped down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t see the entire struggle. Roy tripped over me as something slammed into him. There were loud screeches, and I could hear someone being pinned to the ground. There was scratching, grunting, and finally a snap. Then another snap, followed by a tearing sound; like fingers pressing into a ripe orange. The air got warm as I heard something being casually thrown into the underbrush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeah Babin stepped out in front of me, her mouth covered in hot blood.\n\n“Oh my poor, *poor* Maryland,” she smiled. \n\n“Let’s get you home.”",

        "text": " \n\nI’ve typed this out time and time again only to delete everything and have my consciousness screaming inside my head “JUST TYPE”. Right now I don’t feel anything. I finally took a leap to create an anonymous account and share the inner workings of my brain to the internet so my feelings are shut off. When it comes to computers a majority of problems are solved by shutting it off and turning it back on, we all know emotions do not work along those lines. Shut yourself off from your thoughts and feelings as much as you want they always creep back in and leave you internally screaming into the dark and the dark does not give a fuck about you. Darkness is the endless void of nothingness from which we all came, we don’t remember it, and it does not remember us. But alas, out of the darkness, here we are. I guess I’ll share. \n\nI’ve been shot in every limb. The torso, neck, head, you name it,I’ve had a bullet explode it.\n\nI’ve been lit on fire, burning until the only proof I once existed is the ash blowing away in the wind.\n\nI’ve had my neck cut open with a chainsaw to slowly bleed to death while the rest of my limbs were dismembered - they were idiots though, removing my limbs ended it quicker.\n\nI’ve splattered on pavement going terminal velocity.\n\nI’ve split my soul in two being forced to murder.\n\nI’ve laughed hysterically looking into the eyes of the devil.\n\nI’ve lost love.\n\nI digress.\n\nWhat do you know about dreams? I personally enjoy thinking I know a lot - but dreams are one of those tricky subjects where the more you know the less you understand. One thing I can confidently say I do understand is pain. Emotional and physical. I’ve experienced it enough in my dreams. The memories plague my consciousness even while awake. Burned so vividly into my soul no matter how deeply I suppress them they pop back into my consciousness leaving my body shuddering before I can suppress them once again. \n\nI suppose I’ll share the feeling before I continue because I assume you, dear reader, are curious. Uncontrollable racing of the mind so overwhelming you cannot process anything else. All you feel is pain. Your neurons fire so rapidly in your brain it’s impossible to feel or think of anything else. Then there is a calmness as you feel the neurons firing - slow. Only they are not slowing. Less neurons are firing because they are dying, as are you. Then a strange calmness washes over you. The black void is back and slowly envelopes you. Do not embrace it willingly with open arms, remember the void does not give a fuck about you, nor should you it. The poet Dylan Thomas put it elegantly at the close of one of his poems. “Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” But alas, when a bullet explodes your brain you do not have much choice in the matter I suppose. You’ll wake up once the darkness spits you back out, disgusted your soul wishes nothing more than to live. Rage.  \n\nLife is an interesting topic. Clinging to light, born in darkness, nothing matters more than to simply exist. To live. To Survive. \n\nMy existence and I suppose consciousness were fractured rather recently. After all of my experiences with death and emotion what finally broke me was a simple breeze. A slow rolling wind kissed my cheek softly and whispered in my ear. It was the sort of experience I have only had whilst dreaming. The message was short, the meaning clear. For a short instance everything was frozen. I’m sorry… I am having a hard time finding the words. Have you ever caught a lover cheating? Received news a person who was your world had suddenly passed? Your mind races, it cannot possibly be true. Struggling to accept the reality your world collapses in on itself. You scream internally while struggling to breathe, you don’t want to breathe, you don’t want to live, nothing matters anymore. Emotions so vividly coursing through your mind and veins every muscle in your body contracts but you barely feel it. Your very existence in the moment is nothing but agony. The pain is emotional but you feel every ounce of it physically. I’ve experienced it enough in dreams that experiencing it while awake I simply froze. It helps that I knew it was coming. I thought we would all have more time. \n\nNow my readers it is time for some of you to go. Thank you for reading so far and best of luck. I hope that you pray to whatever higher being you believe in and pray for their mercy. You’ll receive none from me.\n\nThe whisper - while beautiful - was death. The agony, pain, and despair of an entire plant full of life conveyed in one quiet whisper delivered with a soft kiss on the cheek conveying everything will be okay in the end. Sadly we have not reached the end just yet.\n\nThe scientists are wrong. We crossed the threshold a while ago. The chain reaction has begun and there is not a damn thing we can do about it. Our world is dying slowly but will rapidly accelerate. \n\nI’ll save you the rant about the entire chain reaction and get right to why my existence is fractured. Life rages against the dying of the light. Life finds a way to keep living. Yes, sometimes a life must sacrifice itself for the greater good of all life but the driving factor is the same - to keep living. An ant does its duty so the colony may survive. An old or sick wolf leaves its pack so as to not be a burden and ensure the pack's survival. A plant grows in odd/unusual ways to find a source of light to maintain its own existence. This is why I am fractured. A vast majority of humans are corrupt and devoid of the basic principle of life - to keep living. Are we a virus? \n\nEvery single day I watch as the world slowly dies around me and a vast majority of people don’t give a single fuck. I am fractured. I die quickly in my dreams and watch as the world slowly dies around me while awake. There is no god. We killed god, and god remains dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe breeze was warm.\n\nThe devil's eyes are yellow - I saw them while awake.",

        "text": "The house was a small, two-story affair with white siding on the bottom floor and grey shingles on top. Three windows were facing the street: a large picture window; a smaller, rectangular one above that; and another larger window below that.\n\nI got out of my car and walked towards the door. I knocked twice before it opened. A woman stood there wearing a blue dress with her hair tied back in a bun. She had bright green eyes that seemed to sparkle when she saw me standing outside her home. \"Hello,\" she said cheerfully. Her voice was soft but carried well through the quiet night.\n\n\"Hi. Are you Mrs Tanner?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, I am.\" She smiled again and stepped aside so I could enter the house. It smelled odd inside. Not bad or anything like that—just strange. Like old books and dust. \"Please come in,\" she said as we entered the living room.\n\nIt wasn't much more than a couch, a coffee table, and an end table with a lamp on it. That's all I really needed for a place to sleep. The walls were painted yellow, which looked nice against the dark furniture. The carpet was black and covered most of the hardwood floors. There was a small kitchen off to the side of the living room with a sink, stove, and fridge. Everything was clean and tidy.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the mess,\" she said while pointing to some boxes stacked in the corner of the room. \"My husband died last year and I just haven't had time to get around to moving everything yet.\"\n\n\"No problem. I don't mind sleeping in a bit of a mess.\"\n\nShe chuckled softly. \"Well, if you want to put your things away, feel free. Just make sure not to take too long since I have to leave in a few hours.\"\n\n\"Okay. Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome. I'll be right back.\" She disappeared down a hallway.\n\nAs I looked around the room I noticed something else odd about this house. The walls weren't straight. They bulged outward here and there like they'd been pushed from the inside out by someone pushing their way through them. It was subtle enough that it didn't bother me at first, but as I looked closer I realized that it wasn't just the walls either. Every single surface in the entire house had these little imperfections, including the ceiling and floor.\n\nI heard footsteps coming down the hall and turned to see Mrs Tanner returning with two glasses filled with water. She handed me one and took a seat on the couch across from me. \"So what brings you out this way?\" she asked as she sipped her drink.\n\nI'm looking for a friend of mine, he went missing in this area about a month ago\"\n\n\"Oh, that's terrible! What happened?\"\n\n\"he just... vanished.\" I paused as I thought about how to explain it. \"He was staying at an abandoned hotel nearby and never came back. We think he might've gotten lost in the woods.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly. \"That's awful. Is there any chance he survived? Maybe run away somewhere?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I hope so.\"\n\nShe sighed heavily and leaned back on the couch. \"I'm sorry. I wish I could help you find him.\"\n\nWe sat quietly for a moment before she spoke up again. \"I don't mean to pry, but are you sure he isn't still alive? Maybe he's hiding somewhere or something?\"\n\n\"Well...\" I hesitated. \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea where he might've gone?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I have a hunch\"\n\nShe laughed softly and shook her head. \"Well, let me know if you hear anything about him. I'll keep my ears open as well.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said as I stood up from the couch. \"I better go get some sleep now.\"\n\n\"Of course, ill show you to your room\"\n\nI downed the glass of water and placed it on the table. Even that seemed to be crooked. \"Thanks again for letting me stay here.\"\n\nShe waved it off and stood up from the couch. \"You're more than welcome. Please feel free to use anything in the kitchen if you need anything.\"\n\n\"I will.\" I followed her down the hallway to a staircase leading to the second floor. At the top of those stairs was another hallway that led to three doors: one on each side and one at the end. She pointed to the door on the left. \"That one is yours. No one else is staying this weekend so the other doors will be locked.\n\nShe opened the door to my room and flicked on the light switch. There was a dresser opposite the bed with a window above it and a small bed with a nightstand next to it. The wall behind the bed was covered in posters of famous horror films, mostly slasher flicks. \"This should be all set up for you.\" She motioned towards the bed. \"Make yourself comfortable. My room is on the third floor, if you need anything, please just knock on my door.\"\n\n\"Okay, Thanks, I will do\"\n\nShe walked over to the door at the end of the hall and closed it behind her before disappearing into her own room. I took a look around my room before lying down on the bed. The sheets were clean and smelled nice, but I couldn't tell whether they'd been washed recently or not. As I got under them though, I noticed something strange about them. They felt... heavy. Like they were weighted down on one side. When I tried to lift them up, they wouldn't budge. I rolled over onto my back and pulled them back down. Something was definitely wrong with this place.\n\nI lay there staring at the ceiling for a while before drifting off into a deep but restless sleep. I woke up sometime later to a knocking sound on my door. I sat up and rubbed my eyes before standing up from the bed. \"Who is it?\" I called out as I walked over to the door.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nI unlocked the door and cracked it open. It was dark outside but the moon was bright enough that I could see everything clearly. I stepped out into the hallway and saw nothing except darkness. \"Hello?\" I called out again, but once again, there was no response. \"Is someone there?\" I asked as I turned around slowly.\n\nI heard another knock from behind me and spun around only to catch sight of Mrs Tanner standing in the doorway to her room. Her hair had fallen loose from her bun and hung down past her shoulders. She was wearing a white tank top and blue pyjama pants with red stripes running down both sides. She looked like she was trying to hide herself by covering her face with her hands, which were pressed against her cheeks. \"Mrs Tanner?\"\n\nShe didn't say anything and continued to stare at me with wide eyes.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked as I approached her.\n\nShe nodded but kept her head down.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked as I reached out to touch her shoulder.\n\nShe flinched away from my hand and backed up until she hit the wall behind her. Then, without saying a word, she ran down the hallway and disappeared into the shadows.\n\nI stood there for several seconds, dumbfounded by what had just happened. What the hell did I just witness? Was it real? Or was it just some sort of dream or hallucination brought on by stress or exhaustion?\n\nI went back inside my room and locked the door behind me. I grabbed my phone from my pocket and checked the time. It was after midnight. I'd been asleep for hours. I sat on the edge of the bed and stared at a poster of Friday the 13th hanging on the wall above the desk. Why would Mrs Tanner act like that? And why would she try to hide from me when I touched her? It made no sense.\n\nI sighed heavily and laid back down on the bed. I wanted to go back to sleep, but I knew I couldn't fall asleep now. Not until I figured out what was going on here. Maybe if I waited long enough, she'd come back out and explain everything.\n\nI must've fallen asleep eventually because suddenly I was shaken awake by someone pounding on my door. \"Wake up!\"\n\nI jumped up from the bed and opened the door to find Mrs Tanner standing in front of me with her hands balled into fists at her sides. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Get dressed! You have to leave right now!\" she said frantically as she began to pace back and forth across the room.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You don't know how dangerous this place is! Get your things and get out of here now!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe stopped pacing and looked me dead in the eye. \"The house is cursed!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's haunted! There are spirits in this house!\"\n\nI laughed nervously and shook my head. \"There aren't any ghosts.\"\n\n\"Then what do you call that thing you saw earlier tonight?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" I lied. Was she talking about herself?\n\n\"I'm not leaving until I get some answers.\"\n\n\"Please, just go! If you stay here much longer, something bad will happen to you just like your friend!\"\n\n\"My friend?\"\n\n\"Just go!\" she yelled as she started running towards the stairs.\n\n\"Wait!\" I shouted after her, but it was too late. She was already halfway up the steps before she turned around and glared down at me. \"Tell me what happened to him!\"\n\n\"He died,\" she said simply.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"They got to him\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The monsters!\"\n\nI blinked at her and tried to process what she was telling me. \"Monsters?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsters! They came through the walls and took him away!\"\n\n\"Are you insane!?\" I screamed at her. \"There's no such thing as monsters!\"\n\nShe frowned at me and shook her head. \"There are more than you think.\" She then pointed to the floor below us. \"You need to leave right now before they come for you next.\"\n\n\"I can't leave! My friend might be here somewhere! He could still be alive!\"\n\nShe let out a frustrated sigh and walked over to the window. She pushed aside the curtains and looked outside. The moon was bright enough that I could see everything clearly. I followed her gaze out the window and saw nothing except darkness. She pulled open the window and leaned out into the night air. \"He's leaving!\" she called out into the darkness. \n\nI heard a low growl coming from what sounded like inside the walls. Mrs Tanner slowly backed away from the window. Then, without warning, she fell backwards onto the ground. Her body hit the ground with a sickening crunch and didn't move again.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI stood there staring at Mrs Tanner's broken body lying on the floor for several seconds before turning around and sprinting down the stairs. \n\nThe whole house began to creak and moan and it seemed as if the walls were closing in on me. I ran past the kitchen and living room, both of which appeared untouched, and headed towards the front door. The only light came from the moon shining through the windows in the hallway. As I approached the exit, I felt something grab hold of my shoulder and pull me back. I spun around quickly to see a figure standing in the shadows behind me. It was tall and thin with oily skin and long black hair. Its face was covered by a mask made of human bones. I struggled against its grip but couldn't break free.\n\nThe walls looked as if they were melting and more human bone-masked faces were emerging from all around me, surrounding me on all sides and closing in on me until I couldn't breathe. I reached out to touch one of them but only grabbed hold of empty air. Then, suddenly, I was dragged back through the wall and felt myself descending into the pitch-black abyss beneath me.\n\nI woke up gasping for breath and sat straight up in bed. My heart was racing and my body was soaked with sweat. There was a loud bang on the door and I jumped out of bed. I unlocked the door and opened it slightly, just enough to see who was knocking. But when I did, I wasn't surprised to see Mrs Tanner standing there with her hands balled into fists at her sides. \n\n\"Get dressed! You have to leave right now!\"",

        "text": "  What was your school library like? What was your school librarian like? Was he/she mean? Were they nice?\n\n\n The reason I'm asking you all this will be clearer when I tell my story. Hopefully you will catch on to what I'm saying. Or just think this is another creepypasta and scroll on.\n\n\n On one particular day everything was fine. We all had fun that day in middle school. I liked hanging out with my friends because I couldn't hang out with them after.\n\n\n When the time to go to the library came I was excited. I loved the library. Basically I loved books in general. The time you can spend and think you are in a fictional created world was fascinating.\n\n\n The way the library is usually always quiet is a good thing for me. I love reading in silence. I especially love having conversations with the old librarian Mrs. White.\n\n\n She was a sweet kind old woman. Nobody was rarely mean to her. Of they were they were properly scolded by the principal.\n\n\n  As all my classmates were in the library doing our science work because our teacher called in sick the bell rung.\n\n\n Welp, off to Music. I thought.\n\n\n But I had to finish this chapter of this book I'm reading first. I had already completed my work as I always did before the other classmates. I was reading a fantastic story about a thing called a hobbit.\n\n\n  I loved fantasy worlds. The way that even if you stray far from the story just to explore the world in the book itself.\n\n\n I hear someone calling my name in a sort of a silent whisper.  \"Mark\".\n\n\n   I turned around to find no one in the library. Not even the librarian. My heart started beating as i put the book up. \n\n\n  \"Hello? Mrs. White?\" I called out thinking that she was probably in the back with the audio tapes and the newer books that they get through mail.\n\n\n   Shit. I thought. I'm going to be late.\n\n\n   As I went towards the door I heard my name in that same silent whisper.\n\n\n   \"Mark\". I heard it this time. It sent chills all the way down my spine. \n\n\n   \"Mark\", my brain instinctively went into fight or flight mode. But I went to the direction of the voice anyway. For some reason i couldn't move my legs on my own. It's like something was controlling me.\n\n\n   My legs feel like they were about to faint as they kept walking. I felt like I was going to black out. Help, I thought and pleaded to the brain in my head. Don't listen to it. Don't listen to this voice. What is this voice and what does it belong too?\n\n\n  As i went past Mrs. White's desk and towards the small dark room that's always seems like something is going on in there for Mrs. White. \n\n\n   I took a quick glance past the desk and into the hallway as no one is in it. Well I'm in trouble now I thought sarcastically since I'm pretty sure the thing with the voice plans to kill me.\n\n\n   My head then goes back towards the room I'm walking too. Feels like I'm walking the green mile, I thought again in my head.\n\n\n   Then my whole body stops moving. I couldn't even movie it if I tried. My throat was becoming dry and sweat was going down my body. Then a long hairless hand with claw line fingers went out the dark room and held onto the right side of the door.\n\n\n   Please don't go out any further, I thought in fear. I'll have nightmares for the rest of my life.\n\n\n   \"Mark\", it says in that silent voice whisper again as its other arm goes to the left side. Both arms leaving scratch marks by the door. \n\n\n  Then it's grotesque head comes out of the darkness. It looked like Mrs. White's head except morphed into a terrifying shape.\n\n\n   \"Mark\", as the silent voice goes through its hideous open mouth with rotting sharp teeth. \n\n\n   In my mind I'm crying as I am thinking I'm going to die. If i die I knew it wouldn't leave nothing left. This hideous creature wouldn't have survived this long without doing so.\n\n\n   I then with one last resort of my humanity that can still move and think went to embrace a hopefully fast death. \n\n\n   \"Warn them\". That thing said in the same dark whisper. Until then i noticed the rasp in it's voice. \"Warn the bad one's that I will come for them\". \n\n\n   Then this thing went back into the darkness of the room and my body fell as if released by it's weight. Then with the same fear of it still lingering I ran to the door of the library and started knocking and banging as fast and hard as i could.\n\n\n   When a teacher eventually came to my aid I found out that school was over. Somehow that thing kept me there for the whole rest of the school day. \n\n\n   As the teacher went to lead me out of the school building I went to take one last look at that dark room. None of that things scratch marks beside of the door were there.\n\n\n   It made my heart beat faster as I left that school building.\n\n\n   Now the thing I'm going to say is what that creature wanted me to warn. I got what it was trying to say and what the creature is. This thing is a manifestation of all librarian's bad thoughts. It then heads out and hunts the kids that made it be born.\n\n\n   It never hunted me. But, i know that as I went to a couple of highschool reunions that some of my classmates that everyone knew as the bad kids but changed had mysteriously disappeared. Mrs. White the librarian died when I went into highschool but that creature still lives. \n\n\n   Memories linger more than a person does when it dies.\n\n\n   So next time you see your librarian make sure you always be nice to him/her. Make sure to warn the bad kids in your school. If you are one of the bad kids reading this. \n\n\n   I pray for you. Cause it's already with you. Watching. ",

        "text": "The notification came through on the Airbnb app at around 8:30 pm. Someone wanted to rent the apartment, tonight. I swiped down the notification bar and read the first line. \n\nMike has made a reservation, please confirm the booking.\n\nI was already in bed, but it wasn't too late for a booking. I didn't mind renting out my place, it helped pay the bills.\n\nI clicked the notification to open the app. \n\nMy phone was slow and annoying so, I kept tapping the screen where the confirm button would be as I waited for it to load.\n\nI must have tapped it on the right spot 'cause as soon as the app opened it said I had accepted the booking.\n\nI got up and took a shower then, changed into some old clothes before heading over to the apartment to clean it up. \n\nMike wanted to start the booking from 10:30 pm. \n\nAgain, a little late and didn't give me much time but, it was easy money for little effort.\n\nWhen I reached the front door, he was standing outside with his hands shoved deep in his pockets. He had short black hair and wore thick glasses that gave him a nerdy look. \n\nHe looked familiar, but I couldn't quite put my finger on why. His face was pale and he seemed nervous.\n\n\"Are you Mike?\" I asked as I approached the apartment building.\n\n\"uh, yeah!\"\n\nHe stepped forward and shook my hand. \n\n\"I'm Sam,\" I said\n\n\"Sam? Is that your first name or last?\" he asked\n\n\"First,\" I replied.\n\n\"Alright, well nice to meet you first name is Sam.\"\n\nWhat a weird thing to say I thought. But, he seemed like a quirky guy so I thought nothing more of it. \n\nI opened the main door and motioned for Mike to come in.\n\n\"You're not going to need anything else out here right?\" I asked him\n\n\"No! I've got all I need now, thanks!\" he replied.\n\nAnother odd thing to say but whatever, I thought and closed the door behind us. We headed down the corridor to my apartment.\n\n\"So what brings you here tonight?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Tonight?\" He seemed puzzled\n\n\"Yeah, I mean you booked quite late\"\n\n\"I did, didn't I? Yeah, I had another place booked but they cancelled last minute\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh, ok then,\" I said a little confused. \n\nHe seemed a bit spaced out but, he'd paid upfront so I figured he was legit.\n\nI stopped outside my apartment. \n\n\"Well, this is the place if you still want to stay\" I announced.\n\nHe didn't respond.\n\nI put my key in the lock and opened the door.\n\n\"Please take your shoes off and leave them by the front door\".\n\nHe didn't say anything but, took his shoes like I asked while I slipped off my trainers and put on my slippers.\n\nI couldn't help but notice he was staring at my feet the whole time. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable but, as soon as he noticed I had noticed him staring, he looked away.\n\n\"Follow me,\" I said once I had my slippers on.\n\nWe walked into the living room and he sat down on the sofa and immediately started fiddling with his phone. \n\n\"So you're only staying for the night right?\" I asked him trying to get him to engage with me\n\n\"Yup!\" he said without looking away from his phone.\n\n\"What about food?\"\n\n\"I'll grab something later,\" he replied again not taking his eyes off the screen.\n\n\"Ok, well let's go ahead and get you set up with keys then,\" I said.\n\nI went over to the kitchen cupboard, grabbed a set of keys and handed it to Mike. He slipped it into his pocket and went back to tapping on his phone.\n\n\"So, you don't have any luggage or anything?\" I asked him.\n\n\"No, no baggage!\" he replied with a grin on his face.\n\n\"Okay, well, let me give you the tour.\"\n\nI showed him around the apartment but he only seem interested in the kitchen. He was opening cupboards, and drawers and even wiped a small stain on the counter with the sponge.\n\nHe was a bit OCD I thought.\n\nWe headed back to the living room and he sat back on the sofa.\n\n\"So what do you think?\" I asked him\n\n\"Uh, sure, all good, yeah!\" he replied back staring at his phone.\n\n\"Okay then,\" I said and forced a smile before turning to head back into the living room.\n\nHe was odd but, I didn't have to stick around and look after him. I had done my bit so it was time to go.\n\n\"I'm gonna leave you to it, any problems my number is on the fridge,\" I told him pointing towards the kitchen.\n\n\"Yeah, sure!\" he replied still not taking his eyes off his phone.\n\nI turned and walked out into the corridor and stopped by the front door to put my shoes back on.\n\nI took off my slippers and started putting my trainers on. I about had one trainer on when I could have sworn I heard the sound of a camera shutter. \n\nI looked towards the living room to see Mike look away and start tapping on his phone again.\n\nI couldn't be sure but, I felt like he was taking a picture of me. I decided not to make things awkward and accuse him of anything and left. \n\nI felt a bit uncomfortable leaving him alone in the apartment but it was only one night after all.\n\nI got home at about 11:30.\n\nI put my letters down, made a cup of tea and curled up on the bed with my laptop.\n\nI browsed the internet and checked my inboxes.\n\nAirbnb had sent an email confirming Mike's payment had cleared. I guess I was worried about nothing after all.\n\nI fell asleep shortly after that. \n\nThe alarm on my phone went off at 6:43 am. Surprisingly, I felt well-rested and peaceful. \n\nI unlocked my phone and looked at my notifications. \n\nA few spammy emails, a WhatsApp message from my mum wishing me good morning (I swear that woman never sleeps!) and a DM on Airbnb from Mike received at 6:06.\n\nThe message read:\n\n'Hey, sorry I didn't turn up last night, met up with a few mates and ended up crashing on the sofa at one of theirs. Don't worry, I've still paid for the booking and will leave you a 5\\* review.\n\nCheers,\n\nMike.'\n\nWait, what? I was puzzled.\n\nI reread the message several times before I replied.\n\n'Hey man, do you mean you went out with friends after I left and didn't end up coming back? If so, that's cool, as long as you locked up the apartment and left the key.'\n\nMy heart and my mind both were both starting to race. I had to tell myself to chill. Mike probably just got drunk and forgot about meeting me earlier at the apartment.\n\nA few minutes later he replied.\n\n'No, I never even ended up coming to your town. I missed my train and by coincidence bumped into a few friends at the station and we went for a few drinks. Not sure what you mean by 'after I left\"? Anyway, all the best mate.'\n\nNow my heart was racing! If this guy hadn't stayed in my apartment last night then who the hell had!? \n\nThen as I stood there staring at the screen I noticed Mike's profile picture. I clicked on it to enlarge it. \n\nIt was not the guy from. last night! This guy was blonde and built like an NFL player.\n\nI grabbed my keys and ran out to my car to drive over to the apartment. \n\nMy heart and mind were racing now, what if he'd robbed the place, or even worse what if he'd robbed and wrecked the place? I couldn't stop thinking how stupid I was to not check his photo or ask him for his ID!\n\nWhen I got to my apartment there were crowds of people outside, police and an ambulance.\n\nI could feel it had something to do with my apartment.\n\nI parked my car, jumped out and pushed my way to the building entrance where police were blocking the door.\n\n\"Excuse me!\" I shouted trying to push through them.\n\nOne of the officers put his hand on my chest to stop me and said \"Can't let anyone in madame.\"\n\n\"But I own one of the apartments\"!\n\n\"We're conducting an investigation madame,\" he replied.\n\n\"Investigation?\" I asked confused.\n\n\"Yes, someone attacked a young woman inside one of the apartments last night.\"\n\nI froze.\n\n\"What happened?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Sorry, I can't tell you anything more\"\n\nI felt sick, what if it was that guy!?. \n\n\"Do you have any idea who was involved?\" I asked praying it wasn't the guy I let in last night.\n\n\"Look, if you wanna help, keep your eyes open for a nerdy-looking, pale-skinned guy with thick glasses. A few residents say they saw him hanging around outside and one other said they saw him leaving around 1 am\"\n\nMy heart stopped and sank.\n\n\"Oh my god, it's him\" I blurted out.\n\n\"Where!?\" the policeman spluttered looking around.\n\n\"No, I mean that's the man I let stay in my apartment last night, the same man you just described! I thought he was here to rent my Airbnb but I didn't check his picture or ID before letting him. I just assumed he was the guy\"\n\n\"What apartment is yours?\" the officer asked.\n\n\"6...66\" I stuttered.\n\n\"Look, I shouldn't be telling you this but, that's the apartment the young woman was killed in\"\n\n\"Killed!?\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \n\n\"Did you speak to him at all\" The police officer pulled out his notepad and began to scribble things down.\n\n'Yes, I introduced myself to him and he said his name was Mike\".\n\n\"Mike you say?\" Repeated the officer.\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"And your name is madame?\" He asked.\n\n\"Sam\" I answered.\n\n\"But Mike was the name of the guy who had actually made the booking and didn't turn up.\" \n\n\"Okay, you're gonna have to start from the beginning Sam 'cause I'm a little confused\". Said the officer.\n\nI told him about my Airbnb and how the real Mike had messaged me that morning apologising for not turning up.\n\n\"Right, that is quite the mix-up Sam! If you ask me you're lucky to be alive!\"\n\nAt that moment the building doors swung open and the paramedics wheeled out a body covered by a white sheet.\n\nSeeing it triggered the realisation that could be me under there and I burst into tears.\n\n\"I'm so sorry\" I sobbed.\n\nThe officer patted me on the shoulder. \"Hey, it's not your fault Sam, you couldn't have known this would happen.\" \n\nAnother officer came over. They exchanged a few hushed words until finally, the second officer left with the rest of the police.\n\n\"Okay Sam, you'll have to stay elsewhere for a few nights but, you can get anything you need from the apartment now\"\n\n\"Okay, I have another house where I live, this is my Airbnb apartment but, there are a few bits I'd like to grab\"\n\n\"Let's head up\" The officer motioned for me to lead the way and we went into the building and up to my apartment.\n\nWhen I opened the apartment door I expected to see a bloodbath but, no, everything looked, normal. I went into the living room and it was immaculate.\n\n\"You got lucky, the victim was attacked in the kitchen so the cleanup team was able to erase pretty much all traces of the incident. If it had been in here on your carpet it would have been a different matter\" The officer explained.\n\n\"Yeah, that is... lucky, I guess\" I tried to see the positive side of all this but was still shaken up about the whole thing.\n\n\"What exactly did he do to her?\"\n\n\"The girl was visiting another resident and had left the apartment to go home when the killer dragged her into your apartment and choked her to death.\"\n\n\"Oh my God, that's awful!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"That's not even the worst bit. The sicko cut all her toes off and they weren't able to find them anywhere. Forensics reckon he took them with him, some kinda trophy\" \n\nThe officer had a sickened look on his face like he had a bad smell under his nose.\n\n\"You're right, that is sick. Is it okay if I look around to see if anything is missing?\"\n\n\"Sure, go ahead, try not to touch or move things in the kitchen\".\n\nI nodded and began looking around the apartment.\n\nI didn't have many things there. A few spare clothes, some old photos, a toothbrush and some letters I'd forgotten to take with me from the last time I was there. \n\nI picked up the letters and went back to the living room.\n\n\"Well, everything looks pretty normal. Nothing seems to be missing.\"\n\n\"Okay, well if you're about done I'm gonna have to ask you to lock up and head out. Here are the station details and my name, I'm officer Doyle. You can ask for me if you have any questions. We'll be in contact again when we've finished our full investigation.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, that's great. Do you have any idea how long it might be til I can have the apartment back again\"? I asked.\n\n\"It's likely to be about a week. That said, I've got a feeling nobody is gonna be rushing to book your apartment anytime soon!\" The officer chuckled.\n\nHe was way too upbeat for my liking and a little insensitive, to be honest.\n\nI guess he's used to this sort of thing, or maybe that's just how he dealt with things.\n\nI turned around and made my way back to the front door, with the officer behind me. I was about to reach for the door handle when I noticed it, \"Oh my God, He stole my slippers\"!",

        "text": " I used to have a deep phobia of darkness. I straight up refused to leave my house at night, even if it was for a chocolate bar or £10 (I was 10 when this story happened).\n\nI hated walking home on my own in the Winter (I always got detention) and I more or less hated walking to school. However, my mom forced me to walk.\n\nI was walking to school in 2005 - 2006ish and I was talking to my friend about video games - probably Resident Evil 4 or something. I will call my friend Whoosh (we called him that, we all had nicknames) and we were next door neighbours - well, double next door neighbours, there was a person in between us.\n\nThe school was a 25 minute walk away from our homes, and about 10 minutes in (a long, straight road, 200 metres long and 10 metres wide) we saw a man under the street light. This was weird since it was 5:30. Why were we going to school at 5:30? In our school, there was a thing called “Breakfast Club” where you can arrive from 5 AM to 8 AM, then go to the actual school.\n\nHe was long, had lanky, skinny arms and was black. Pure black.\n\nWhoosh said that it was just because of the light but I wasn’t so sure. The light was right above him.\n\nI nudged past the man and I asked: “Sir, why ‘r’ you up so early?”\n\nI was a dumb kid. I didn’t know basic respect and person space, so as you can probably tell Whoosh was trying to shut me up. He muttered, “Mate! Don’t you know not to talk to strangers?” \n\nI felt ashamed and walked away. But not before taking one final glance at the man. \n\n“I am a night owl,” I heard as I spun round. It was said in a British accent - but it seemed like it was artificial. English was clearly not built for this fellow. When I did spin around, he was gone. But his voice still lingered. It was like he faded - but not entirely. “Not like I liked lights anyway.”\n\nThis time Whoosh turned around. “He’s not here, right?..”\n\nMy friend group consisted of Whoosh, Bash, Bong and Crackle. My nickname was Crunch. Crackle was the only one who wasn’t at breakfast club. Me and Whoosh told the others about the man and they told us to just bring a camera tomorrow. It was quite reasonable.\n\nSo we did. 24 hours later, I recorded the man and kept the camera on him. I kept the camera behind my butt, and when we walked past him, he said: “So you boys came back ag’in, huh?” \n\nI looked behind me. His arms weren’t there. Instead were wings. I looked back, motioned to Whoosh, and he looked behind him as well. Nobody. \n\n“You must just be imagining things.”\n\nMe and him reviewed the camera footage when we arrived home. My home, in particular. \n\nThe camera picked up the arms coming back into his body… I could see some black liquid squirting out. Before the liquid hit the floor, it all formed into one large stick, before squirting out feathers. Eventually it solidified and stopped shining.\n\nI stared in silence. I could hear the bathroom door and Whoosh puking.\n\nI walked to school at 4:30 AM the day after that. I made sure to wake up extra early. I walked past the man with the camera, not daring to turn around and arrived near the gates of breakfast club. I looked at the camera footage.\n\nThis time the legs shrivelled up, still holding the man still and eventually it squirted some more of the black liquid. Around him it formed bird legs - it took me a few seconds to realise he was turning into a bird. But that’s outlandish, right? Plus, why would the man wait an entire hour for us to come? That was weird.\n\nMe and Whoosh woke up at 4 AM and snuck out.\n\nI saw a crow there. I sighed in relief and closed my eyes, but then I heard Whoosh screaming. I opened them, and I saw the crow in front of me.\n\n“Why’re you so scared?” I said. What I didn’t expect, however, was this… \n\n“Walk away.”\n\nI was too scared to move. Did the crow just say something? But that was impossible, right?\n\nI snuck back into my home and went to bed.\n\nBreakfast club - I told Bong. He seemed to be the smartest there is.\n\n“It’s fake. It… it has to be fake.” \n\nThe next day. I walked past the man. Alone. I looked back. It was a human. With bird proportions, bird legs, bird wings and it had a human chest and a human neck and face, but it had a bird beak. It ran for me. Before I could even react, it grabbed me and opened its beak. Now I could confirm - it was pitch black. It put my legs in its mouth and then I dropped to the floor. I was frozen. After about 10 minutes, I looked backwards. It was gone.\n\nThe taste lingered in the air. The foul, foul taste. Until something else lingered. Something else.\n\n“It will come soon enough.”",

        "text": "Hey folks,\n\nIve always had fast growing fingernails. Ive got a bad habit of chewing on them, or tearing them qh\nqhen they get broke or turn into hangnails, because while they are thick and grow fast, they arent particularly strong. \n\nAs ive gotten older, ive gotten hairier and the texture of my hair and fingernails have changed. When i was young, they were smooth, and kinda shiny and... pinkish? Like you could see through them a little to the nail bed below. Now theyre fairly opaque and theyve got these grooves or ridges or something along the direction that they grow, like some folk's teeth do. They are much much thicker than they used to be. I think its just one of the things that happens as you get older, like your skin becoming a little less firm and youre tired more.\n\nI used to have to cut them every other week, now it's down to every few days. Theyre sharpish, and brittle, but they grow like nobodies business. \n\nOn Sunday i took a nap but i woke up in pain. I slept like i awlays do, I had my fingers curled in on themselves while i slept, and when i woke up, one of my nails had pierced my palm. I was actually bleeding a little, ans it stung super bad.\n\nmy middle fingernail on my right hand broke off a little as i uncurled my hands and i had to dig the broken bits out of my palm with a pair of tweezers, which was not fun at all. I dont know what it is about scratches by they take forever to heal, so even today its still itchy. I hope its not infected, i thought i got all the finger nail but you can never be certain with little fragile bits.\n\nThats a side point though, yesterday, i was done with it. I had cut them on sunday, again on tuesday, and then yesterday i had to cut them AGAIN. i got impatient, and accidentally twisted the scissors when i was doing my dominant pointer finger. I'm sure youve all done it cutting something too thick, too,  you try to cut something but it forces the blades apart and the whole thing twists. I creased my nail in that horrible way that happens sometimes where it gets that weird white line across it and it isnt as firm as it was before. You know, where itll be marked now and itll have this tendency to fold again? That happened and now i couldnt get purchase on it with the scissors anymore. \n\nSo i tried some wire cutters, and they cut it but they got stuck when the nail folded between the blades of it, so i figured what the hell, ill just tear the nail. \n\nBut it wouldnt tear. I pulled on it and nothing happened so i really gave it a hard tug and i felt a weird pop and the cuticle started to bleed, and it really, really hurt. Like when the skin peels off of chapped lips times 100. It was powerful unpleasantness. \n\nI thought i tore the nail put by the root, but when i let go of the pliers they were still stuck with the folded bit between the blades. They were just hanging further down, maybe a quarter of an inch or so? Your nails have to grow from somewhere, right? Its not like they start at your cuticle, thats just where they break out of your skin\n\nI figured that that was it, i tore it out but it hadnt quite cleared the root of the nail. The pain was really distracting, and ive been so tired lately, so i pulled some more. I think i was thinking that it must be like a topth, where pulling it hurts but once its out the pain subsides quickly, and then, after a while  the new one grows in. \n\nSo i pulled again, and i could feel the edge of the nail, on the sides, cutting into me, but i could feel something kinda sliding and popping and i thought it was getting looser so i gave it a really good tug and with a little pop, felt more than heard, the wire cutters came free. I didnt want to look at it for a minute, there was a fair amount of blood. \n\nI went to go wash it under the sink and as i did i saw that the nail was still attached, i had just freed the wirecutters. The tip of the nail was hanging down off the end of my finger almost a full two and a half inches longer than it was, and while it was bloody, it was still very much attached and normally shaped, and just as thick as they ever were, but softer somehow. Almost leathery or something. \n\nI tried to cut it again and it wouldnt cut. I know it doesnt make any sense, but i was just so tired. Ive been so tired lately. I gave up. \n\nI just went to bed. That was around this time yesterday.\n\nI woke up super late today, just a half hour ago or so. I gotta go to the doctor or something. The pointer nail is longer now and the wound from sunday is itching like crazy, but i think i can see why. When i get it under good light i can see the left over bits of nail starting to surface.\n\nI thought it would, the ones in the trash always keep growing too. But i dont have to tell anybody that, right? You all know what its like. \n\nIll check in a bit to see if anyone has any advice. right now i gotta get some nore sleep. Still so tired.",

        "text": "As the title reads, I stayed in one of those trendy, all-over travel vlogs, hotel capsules during a business trip. \n\nIt seemed like a good idea when I was booking it; save a few bucks, and spend the extra business allowance I was given on whatever I wanted. In hindsight, though, it was a terrible idea. \n\nIt was so cramped, the mattress was awful(if you can call stainless steel a mattress lol), I asked for a top bunk but got given a bottom one, there was no soundproofing, and I got absolutely nosleep! 2/10. \n\nTo be fair, I did book it off a pretty shady website that I found off a random ad in Facebookland. So I'm not sure what I really expected. But I definitely thought there'd be fewer bodies and more blankets. \n\nThe body to blanket ratio was definitely off. The sheet to body ratio was alright, but when it's like 4 degrees Celsius, a sheet doesn't do much.... \n\nI definitely thought it would be warmer, but some people do sleep better in cooler temperatures, I suppose. It's not ALL about me. (Sometimes I like to pretend it is, don't we all?) \n\nAnyhow, yeah, 2/10. \n\nThe neighbours were mostly quiet, except for some occasional grunting, crying, and scratching. The hosts were the loudest for sure. Always talking to themselves or whoever else was there. No clue. Once you're in those capsules, you gotta wait for them to let you out. So I wasn't really able to see who was talking. I could definitely hear it though, because, like I said, no soundproofing. \n\nThey'd always start off with the date, they said the damn date like 8 times a day during my stay. And then a random name, my guess is other patrons of the capsules. Then they'd make a lot of noise, really weird noises. Sometimes, a buzzing like a saw or something would happen. I've never stayed in one of these before, and travel vlogs are always glamorized, so I just figured this was all normal. Not my business, I'm no expert. I'm just here to save money and sleep. \n\nI did not sleep. There was nosleep in there. None. How could you? Cold, dark, loud. \n\nI decided I wanted to leave before check out and started banging on my door. Everything went quiet, and the hosts started opening random capsules, so I knocked louder. They eventually opened the right door,( you'd think if you're running a business like this you'd be more efficient at this.) They appeared quite panicked, asking what I was doing, how I got here etc. \n\nObviously, I'm thinking, wow, you guys really don't have your shit together at all. I reserved this capsule ages ago, and while I did let myself in, I assumed that's what you do and that you know I checked in,(like an air bnb) But, I cooperate and tell them my name and all that jazz. They go over their handy little list of guests and can't find me. I don't know why. Poor record keeping on their part, I'm guessing? They confer with each other for a minute, make a couple phone calls and then tell me to get the fuck out. Obviously, I did exactly that and went and checked in at a proper hotel, with a bed and bathroom. And finally got some freaking sleep. \n\nSo, here's my review of Lemor Gue capsule hotel. \n\nDon't bother. \n\nYou might get nosleep or worse, too much.",

        "text": "I’ll start by telling you what has been going on since my last post. It’s been a lot. So, I’m going to struggle. The blanket of fog in front of my eyes and enveloping my mind is getting thicker. I like to believe that it’s a good thing. I don’t want to think coherently anymore. Thinking means remembering and remembering is pain like I’ve never felt before. Like my body is being ripped limb from limb  just like my paper doll.\n\nSeveral days ago, the note my psycho neighbor left me was scrunched in my fist while her paper replica of my mother sat on my kitchen table. She had kidnapped my mom after revealing her so-called children were nothing but brainwashed flesh puppets under her control.\n\n*If something were to happen to your mom, do not worry. I will take you in. I want you to remember that.\n\nLove,\n\nMrs Wilder.\n\nPS: I can’t wait for you to (not) meet my newest son! *\n\nI was still seeing what had happened the night before. I was seeing her plunging the blade of the knife into a squirming body bag until it went still, and then throwing it over her shoulder like they were nothing. Just doll pieces. Spare parts. That’s what she had said, kneeling next to the body bag where scarlet had started to pool, staining the sidewalk. I had watched her reach out with an almost motherly-like touch, grazing her fingers over the body. Her fifth victim. Mrs Wilder already had Casper and his siblings. Her four ‘original’ children. So, what did she need with another kid? Scrunching the letter into a ball, I held myself. Kidnapping my mother because of my so-called disobedience was a new low. \n\nThe witch knew exactly how to scare me. How to control me. But I wasn’t giving up. After dumping the cookies in the trash, I grabbed my mom’s paper-doll and tried to rip it to pieces, but the paper felt strange between my fingers—like I wasn’t tearing through paper. It was thicker and harder to get through, like tearing through plastic. The doll had a waxy texture to it. But I was determined to get rid of the thing. Gritting my teeth, I used all my strength to tear off the stupid doll’s head. That was enough.\n\nIt was such a pathetic way of thinking but I was sure that destroying Mrs Wilder’s paper rendition of my mother would save the real version. Throwing what was left of the doll in the trash with the cookies, I sprinted upstairs to my bedroom after locking the door and grabbing a knife from the kitchen.\n\nInitially, I wanted nothing more than to crawl under my bed and hide. I couldn’t stop shivering, my body trembling. The events of the night before were still haunting me.\n\n Mrs Wilder’s kids were nothing but patchwork dolls made from dead flesh and Casper was a work in progress. Unfinished. From the look of the framed ultrasounds in the Wilder hallway, I was right. My neighbor had lost her own children at birth, and had kidnapped four of them in their place, and was raising them as her own using some kind of enhanced brainwashing technology.  The town knew exactly what she was doing, and the bitch had the cops right under her thumb. They had delivered her a dead body for spare parts. I had to get out. With or without my mom, I was getting out of town. But I knew I couldn’t leave them. \n\nMrs Wilder’s children. Her dolls. Whatever was left of them, even if I couldn’t call them human… I had to get them out of there.  \n\nAfter the night before, I was sure Casper’s window would be blocked out by his curtains. But I was wrong. I could see his room perfectly. Though there was no sign of him. His bed was unmade, pillows and sheets crumpled on the floor. I wondered where he was. Maybe he was in the kitchen having breakfast with his plastic brothers and sister. Breathing hard, I struggled to think straight. I had to think of a coherent plan. Mrs Wilder’s letter was a threat--and looking around my own room, the reality of her words started to sink in. \n\nAll of my drawing supplies were gone. Pens and pencils, every scrap of paper and all my notepads and workbooks. Even my bookshelves had been purged. Standing still against my door, I mentally went over every word of the letter. Mrs Wilder had boasted about listening devices being fitted so she would know when I was talking to her son.\n\nShe was smart enough to bug my room and yet failed to realise I was faking my Instagram stream.\n\nI was digging through my draws for anything discernible to write on when I caught movement in Casper’s window. Ducking to my knees, I glimpsed the boy next door stumbling inside the room. Mrs Wilder followed, shoving him onto the bed. The way he was moving, staggering, his eyes wide—I knew he was himself.  There was something else. Casper’s arms were pinned behind his back. He was tied up. So much for motherly love. The crazy witch was finally showing her true colours. \n\nI watched her forcibly sit him on the edge of his bed. She knelt in front of him and took his struggling face into her hands, cradling his cheeks. He spat at her, struggling in his bindings, but Mrs Wilder barely seemed fazed.\n\nHer expression was twisted with desperation for him to submit to her. But that wasn’t what was happening. He was struggling and squirming with everything he had, pulling and yanking at the restraints wrapped around his wrists. I read her lips. I love you. I love you so much, Casper. She was saying it over and over again, before getting to her feet and grabbing the snake-like chord she had carried in with her. Mrs Wilder knew the thing scared him. \n\nIt terrified him. \n\nHer movement was intentionally slow, fingernails digging into the plastic end. Immediately, Casper shuffled back, his eyes widening with fright. He shook his head. *No*. \n\nHis lips formed the words in a strangled cry I could almost hear through the glass. *Please*. \n\nI knew his splintered self was aware of his current state. The cavernous hole in the back of his skull where that thing resided. Mrs Wilder could attempt to take it away with brainwashing, but once that thing was out of his head, he was awake and aware of what she was doing to him. Knowing this filled me with hope. I was still in denial of what I had seen. I didn’t want to accept that he was dead—that he was nothing but patchwork flesh and vacant eyes like the other Wilder kids. They had submitted to her. They were under her control.\n\nCasper wasn’t.\n\nI didn’t want to watch, but something kept my gaze glued to the widow as I struggled to breathe, gripping onto my carpet like it was an anchor. Like it could help me catch my breath. Mrs Wilder was forceful this time. Her touch was no longer gentle. Ignoring the boy’s screams, she gripped onto his hair and yanked it back, forcing him to look at her while her other hand holding the chord slid the thing under his shirt, and like it was sentient, like it had a mind of its own, it crept its way up his spine, inserting itself in two places before burying its way into the back of his skull.\n\nI had never seen this thing attach itself to him. I had only ever seen it connected to the back of his head. I had no idea it was like a creature, nestling itself inside the boy’s brain like it was eating its way through him. Casper’s body reacted to the intrusion, jolting like he had been shocked. His head tipped back, his eyes rolling back, lips forming a cry which crumpled when the device turned a light green color, and his expression relaxed. The device had successfully leeched itself onto him, and the boy next door was once again doll-like. \n\nHe blinked once and then again, his lips forming a small smile. Casper sat up with confused eyes and spoke to his mother. He started forwards, and I noticed the light turn red for a second, before flicking back to green. In sync, Casper’s expression looked like it was glitching, a wide and emotionless smile faltering before righting itself. He was fighting it. Either that, or the device was faulty. \n\nExcept I had seen exactly what he was like out of her control. Casper Wilder was a completely different person. I had no doubt this boy wasn’t clamouring to stay in control. Mrs Wilder didn’t seem to notice. It looked like Casper was asking her what was going on. Mrs Wider knelt in front of him and grasped his hands, squeezing them.\n\n“Stay here.” Her lips stretched in satisfaction mouthed before she stood up slowly and ruffled his hair. “I’ll be right back, okay?” She mouthed, before her head twisted to the window. I flattened myself against my carpet, my heart in my throat. It was almost like she could sense me watching. I stayed hidden until I was sure she was gone. When I slowly raised my head, there was no sign of Mrs Wilder. \n\nBut Casper was staring directly at me. I dived to my feet and hurried to my window—and the boy next door’s gaze followed me. He looked almost frenzied, feral, like a predator tracking its meal. The device was flashing from red to green, his expression contorting with it. I could see the desperation inside him, his wriggling arms trying to free himself. I knew exactly what he was trying to do. Casper was going to yank that thing out. Which would almost certainly kill him if he didn’t know what he was doing. \n\nThat device was connected to his spine too, a technology I had never seen before. I shook my head and mouthed for him to stop, but he was ignoring me, squeezing his eyes shut. \n\nFuck. If that thing was in my head, I would want the exact same. But he had to know that tugging it out like an idiot would make things worse. I looked for something to message him with, but everything had been taken. There was nothing to write with. I pressed my index against the glass pane, attempting to write in condensation, but there was nothing. The tip of my finger was wet and smelled potent. Mrs Wilder really had gone to the extreme to make sure I wasn’t communicating with her son.\n\nFrom the look on Casper's face, he was growing closer to freeing himself with brute force. When he tugged his wrists apart finally, the first thing he did was jump off of the bed and stumble to the window, still attached to the device. \n\n*You*. Casper’s lips curved in disgust. His eyes narrowed,  and he slammed his fists into the glass.  I jumped back, my gut twisting. Are you with them*\n\n*What*? I mouthed back. The more I spoke to the boy underneath the doll, more of his real personality was coming through. *No*!\n\nHe folded his arms, his head twitching. \n\nI suck at lip-reading, but the way he spoke, his twitching mouth perfectly forming each word, I saw his messages in clarity. *You left me*. Casper manically gestured to his door, clawing at his face until his fingernails drew blood. \n\n*You left me with them!*\n\n*I tried to save you*! I mouthed back.\n\nMy gaze flicked to the device still attached to his head, and his fingers grasped at the chord, all the resolve crumbling in his expression.\n\n*Fuck*.\n\n*Need to get it out.*\n\nHe dropped to his knees. I sensed his desperation, each word dripping from his lips.\n\n*I need to get it out of my head!*\n\n*It hurts!*\n\n*It… it fucking hurts!*\n\nThe boy’s face twisted into an animalistic cry, and he yanked at the chord, ignoring pooling black pooling from his nose. There it was again. That feral urge to get the thing out of his head no matter what. I pressed my palm against the window, jutting my chin at the erratic light struggling between red and green. I struggled to get his attention, stabbing at my own head. “Listen to me.” I mouthed. *Hey! Look at me!*\n\nCasper shook his head. He took a shaky step back. I searched for the stitches on his skin, for rugged flesh and glimpses of patchwork shades of light and dark, but he looked like he always did. Perfect. It was only under candlelight in the Wilder kitchen had I seen his true form. It didn’t make sense to me that two versions of him existed. The one I was seeing, a teenage kid with a perfectly normal body, and his doll-self sitting next to his siblings, the flesh of his neck stitched up. “I can’t do this, Phoebe.” His lips formed the words, and I had to swallow barf.\n\nTears glistened in his eyes, and he blinked them back, his eyes flickering and rolling to pearly whites and back to normal. He was trying to stay in control, and that thing was digging deeper. Casper was going to lose either way. His body was nothing but Mrs Wilder’s canvas.\n\n“Casper!” I knocked on my window, manically pointing to my own head. “You can’t pull it out! That thing will kill you!”\n\nFuck.\n\nHe wasn’t listening to me.\n\nI had nothing to draw with, and every time Casper maniacally yanked at the device which was trying and failing to take control, a little piece of me died. He couldn’t see sharp rivulets of black dripping down his face every time he tried to pull at the thing. The damage already done was monumental, but  Casper was making it worse. His writhing hands were clawing at the metal legs attached to his head, when I suddenly became all too aware of what I was holding. I could feel it slick between my fist, the hard-wood of my mother’s favourite carving knife.\n\nIt was supposed to be a weapon, but feeling it perfectly moulded into the flesh of my palm, I realised it could also be an instrument to an artist desperate enough. Casper had used his own blood as paint, and despite knowing it was a stupid idea, I didn’t have a choice. Casper was going to kill himself or destroy what was left of his doll-like body. I told myself it wouldn’t hurt, and that was a huge fucking lie to myself.\n\nI have only ever cut myself once while washing the dishes a kid.  Mom had freaked out, bandaging me up and insisting on a hospital visit to make sure I was okay. The cut was tiny. This was… different. This was self-inflicted. \n\nThe second I dug the teeth of the blade into my arm, I regretted it. The pain was searing, and I had to grab something to scream into. The pain was like nothing I had ever felt before, a cruel and relentless slicing stabbing into my skin. It hurt. It hurt so fucking much.  Thankfully though, halfway through the first letter, where I had been attempting to carve U WILL DIE into my skin, Casper’s grip on the chord slipped, and the end hit the ground. He seemed to stiffen up. His eyes were wide suddenly, almost catatonic. Thank god. I really didn’t want to permanently ruin my arm to get a message across, but the U I had successfully sliced into several layers of my flesh was burning.\n\nScreaming into an old pair of jeans, I was  aware of pooling scarlet dripping in tiny rivers, streaking down my wrist, then my palms and fingers. The knife dropped from my fingers, and I straightened up, struggling to keep my cool. Initially, I thought Casper’s reaction was because he’d figured out what I had been trying to carve into my arm.\n\nInstead though, his eyes were glued to something behind me. Casper stumbled back, his lips forming words I managed to see. \n\n“Mom.”\n\nHe slammed his fists into the glass. \n\n\"Mom!\" \n\nFor a moment I was frozen, before what he was mouthing fully registered.\n\nBut Casper wasn’t alone.\n\nMatilda Wilder was behind him, wrapping her arms around his neck, one hand coming to forcefully shove the device in deeper. The boy went limp for a moment, his eyes rolling back, before drooping in her arms. He was still yelling, struggling, but his body wouldn’t move.\n\nAnd the more he squirmed, pieces of chipped skull and flesh were getting caught on the neck of his t-shirt, blood the shade of ink dripping down his face. Casper’s eyes were unseeing, only alive through flickering man-made light. The realisation hit me like a wave of ice water. \n\nIt didn’t matter what I tried, the boy next door was dead. I was in denial. I wanted to believe that he was still human, but what I was seeing wasn’t human. It was consciousness being forced to accept dead flesh.  And it was torture for him. He was right to try and pull that thing out and end whatever cruel experiment his mother was subjecting him to. \n\nCasper Wilder was passed saving. \n\nI thought I was saving him by getting that thing out of his head and back to normal. \n\nExcept there was no normal—and I was a self-righteous child for thinking that was better for him. Casper didn’t need saving. \n\nHe needed to be put down like the rest of his undead siblings. \n\nBut I had come to that conclusion far too late. If it had been just minutes earlier, I would have told him to pull it out. To end his suffering for good. Matilda had a strong grip, easily gagging his cries. Though they weren’t for himself. He was screaming at me. Ripped from my own reverie, I was suddenly aware of the shadow looming behind me, the shadow I hadn’t noticed because the pain was playing with my head, sending my thoughts into a hurricane.\n\nInstead of twisting around, I stared down at thick rivulets of red dripping down my wrist. I was making a mess, I thought dizzily. Mom wouldn’t like that. Fuck. She was going to kill me for getting blood all over her brand new carpet. “Oh, Phoebe,” Mrs Wilder’s voice was smooth like honey.\n\nI had barely noticed her embrace. It was motherly. Which caught me off guard. Not like she was trapping me. More like a hug. Her face was warm, her breath coming out in sharp pants against the back of my neck. She chuckled, and her grip tightened, her clammy hand suffocating my mouth. “How sweet. I think my son likes you. Now, I know Casper isn’t very well. His body is quite sick due to rejection— but I’ll be fixing they very soon. So, please try and ignore his… erratic behaviour.” \n\nI took a step back, and she followed me, her spare hand coming to graze over the gash on my arm. She sighed. “Really, Phoebe, I hate you.” She spat into my neck. “I want to drill into you and take you apart like all of my sweet dolls. I want to dress you up in all of the best clothes and braid your pretty hair, but why on earth would I waste a face like yours, hmm?”\n\nI was paralysed as her fingers sifted through my hair and pulled at my cheeks. “Pretty.” She hummed. “Pretty eyes, pretty lips, pretty nose.” Mrs Wilder laughed. She held out her hand and sitting on her palm was a paper doll. My paper doll, which had been clumsily mended with sticky tape gluing its head back onto its doll-torso. Through fraying vision as her palm suffocated my nose and mouth, I watched her crush the doll slowly, crunching it up in her fist—and my body began to fold too, dropping to the ground, my head slamming into the carpet. I couldn’t breathe, my body was on fire. I could feel every bone snapping, but my mouth wasn’t working. “Pretty.” Mrs Wilder continued. She knelt in front of me with the remnants of the doll sitting on the palm of her hand.\n\n“Like my daughter is going to be.”\n\nHer lips stretched into a wide smile, a monstrous grin splitting her face apart. “Really, baby, you should never have stuck your nose is business which wasn’t yours. Because then I might not have properly seen you. Your pretty face, and perfect cheeks, and round brown eyes which I have wanted for a long, long time.” \n\nThe woman sat up with a sigh, while black spots danced in my vision, threatening to plunge me into the dark. Her voice followed me as a wet rag once again found my mouth. “You have no idea how long I have been looking for the perfect parts, sweetie. And now I have them!” She laughed again. “You are quite the gold mine, aren’t you? I think I will start by scooping your eyes out…”\n\n“…Then I will peel off your face…”\n\nThe woman’s words faded in and out, and I felt her lift my unresponsive body, forcing me to my feet like a puppet on strings.\n\nShe was controlling my body and inflicting pain on me through my doll.\n\nMom’s paper doll came to my dizzying mind. I’d ripped it to shreds. A sickly paste crept its way up my throat. Her fingers came apart, revealing the half scrunched up doll— and I could breathe again. Her fingernails picked at the doll’s tiny arms, and I felt the ghostly sensation of something stabbing at my skin, digging into the word I had carved into myself. “Don’t hurt yourself, Phoebe. I don’t like scarred flesh.”\n\nHer hand which smelled like rot and filth, clutching the soaked rag was suffocating me, sending me into spiralling oblivion, choking on the stink of pool cleaner and rich lavender. That was Mrs Wilder's scent. She smelled like clinical rooms and wildflowers. Mrs Wilder was the opposite of death despite playing around with mangled corpses, transforming flesh into doll pieces. I don't remember much. \n\nMy knees hit the ground once again, my body following. I could still hear Casper's frenzied knocks. When I last saw him, he had managed to claw himself out of his sister’s grasp and to the window. His cries filled with splintered agony, and yet a fake happiness and euphoria being drilled into what should have been a dead brain. \n\nCasper was dead, I thought, as the ground began to disappear from underneath me. \n\nHow was I supposed to save a boy who was already dead? \n\nThe thought hung onto me. I wasn’t passed out for long. When I opened my eyes, my face felt... strange. It felt sore. Like I'd rubbed sandpaper all over my cheeks. Through blurry vision, I saw slithers of late afternoon sunlight peeking through the blinds, and familiar sunshine coloured walls. I was in our kitchen. \n\nBut I couldn't... move. \n\nThere was something restricting my arms-- and when I let out a shriek, my teeth clamped around something which had been forcibly lodged inside my mouth. I knew what it was from the taste of it, an overwhelming aroma filling my mouth with memories from playing in my mother's flower garden as a little kid. \n\nRoses. \n\nFreshly picked roses mixing with the taste of my own blood pooling down my lips and chin. Panic struck, and I struggled violently, my gaze flashing to what was in front of me. There was my paper-doll lying on its back. Mrs Wilder had drawn eyes and a mouth curved into the shape of a scream. Next to the doll was a mirror showing me my reflection. My dark hair had been tied back, exposing pale cheeks and shadowed eyes. I looked like shit.\n\nThough that was not what I was looking at.\n\nMy gaze was on my own cheeks and nose and forehead, where the witch had scrawled over my skin, like a hyperactive child with finger paint. The ink was red, arrows pointing to my lips, bloated bubbles circling and crossing out which parts she was going to cut, and which parts she was going to leave. The sight was horrifying. Like I was in my own personal horror movie. I started to scream, spitting out the rose. It landed on the ground with a wet sounding smack, and I rocked backwards and forwards in the chair, noticing I had been dressed in plastic overalls over my own clothes. For the blood, I thought. She didn’t want to make a mess. \n\nI screamed, and it was guttural, and I didn’t stop screaming until my throat was aching. The markings on my face felt like finality. They were going to happen. They were itchy, ice-cold on my skin. I noticed Mrs Wilder had bandaged my arm and that sent my stomach heaving, eliciting another screech. \"Mom!\" I sobbed, kicking my legs.\n\nMy feverish eyes snapped to the trash where I dumped my mother’s paper doll. I thought back to my own body folding in on itself, mimicking the doll crushed between Mrs Wilder’s fist.\n\nThere was something about the image which set off something feral inside me. I didn’t scream or cry, or struggle. I just stared at the trash can, swallowing sour barf which kept creeping up the back of my throat. I was losing my fucking mind. I can’t explain what I felt like right then, because I have never felt true despair in my life except at this point and the hours following. Like the world was crumbling beneath my feet, like I was being torn into pieces with nobody to put me back together. \n\nI needed my mom. I needed my mom, and she wasn’t coming. Mom was always there when I was upset or sick I was scared—and there was nothing left of her but that stupid paper doll I was regretting throwing in the trash.\n\nMother instinct, huh? \n\nBullshit! \n\nWhere was her mother's instinct when I was about to be carved up by our neighbour?\n\nThe logical part of me knew my mother’s mind had been played with to benefit Mrs Wilder and her psychic book club. \n\nBut I wasn’t exactly thinking logically at that time. I can’t remember what I was doing when the knock sounded. I think I was staring at the markings on my face and wondering what flaws Mrs Wilder was planning on cutting away. I was spare parts for Matilda, but what was she going to do with the rest of me? “Hello?” The voice was enough to almost send me toppling off of the chair. “Hey, are you okay in there?\"\n\nIt was a guy’s voice. I recognised it from school.\n\nGritting my teeth, I willed myself not to scream. “There’s a spare key,” I managed to get out, pulling at the rope restraining my wrists. “There’s a spare key under the brick near the door. Get the key and unlock the door. You need to… you need to get in here and untie me.”\n\n“Untie you?”\n\nHis voice sounded oddly close despite him being outside. “Wait, is this some kind of foreplay?”\n\n“No!” I held myself against another screech. “Just get in here. Please.”\n\nI waited for the door to open, but nothing happened and my heart sank.\n\n“Hey!” I cried out, panic creeping its way up my spine. “Hey, are you still there?” I tipped my head back. “Hey! I need… I need help!”\n\nWhen I was staring at the ceiling, trying and failing to pull my bindings apart, a shadow looming in the doorway made me jump. It was too small to be Mrs Wilder. \n\nStraightening up, I blinked rapidly, drinking in the figure which bled into a real person. It was a kid from my school. The guy sat behind me in math class and sometimes twisted around in his chair and asked how my day was going. \n\nHe was smallish with light brown hair, his signature football jersey awkwardly hanging off one shoulder. Harry Markham. The guy spent 99.9% of class with his head in his arms, and when he was awake he could barely sit still, his shoe constantly tapping beats into the floor.\n\nI was used to his bright smile which I was sure was permanently glued to his face—but the kid looked frightened. His eyes were wide, lips twisted in a what-the-fuck-is-going-on? scowl. \n\n“Uh.” Harry ran his hands through his hair. I noticed he was trembling. He started forwards but seemed to hesitate, twisting around to frown at the door like he was waiting for my assailant to come back.  “What's going on? Did I just walk onto the set of Criminal Minds?”\n\n“How did you…” I trailed off, shaking my head. “You need to untie me!”\n\nHis cheeks turned significantly paler. “So, someone just strolled in and tied you up?”\n\n“Something like that.”\n\nI couldn’t feel his fingers sifting through the rope, but the restraints were loosening around my wrists.\n\n“Hurry up, Harry.” I managed to get out. “I need to get to my mom.”\n\n“I am. Your wiggling isn’t helping.” \n\nHis voice was edging on hysteria. “And you’re going to tell me what’s going on, right?” He paused. “It’s Harvey, by the way. You’ve sat behind me for four months, and you can’t  remember my name?”\n\nWhen the ropes fell away, I dove to my feet, scrambling to keep myself balanced. “Do you have your phone?”\n\nHarvey’s expression crumpled. He patted his jeans. “Uh, I don’t think so?”\n\n“You don’t think so? You either do or you don’t!”\n\nStruggling to stand, I cursed whatever drugs had been forced into my bloodstream. I had to find my phone.\n\nHarvey scoffed. \"Well, I'm sorry!” His tone dripped sarcasm. “I wasn't expecting to be involved in a kidnapping.”\n\n“I’m not the one who has been kidnapped,” I hissed out, rummaging for mom’s phone she left for emergencies.\n\nHarvey followed me awkwardly. “Right. So, who exactly tied you up and drew all over your face?” He situated himself in front of me, his eyes darkening. “Come on, new kid. I need something here. I find you tied up, and you’re just going to leave me completely in the dark?”\n\nI dived over our sofa, lifting up cushions and throwing them onto the floor in frustration. “The kids next door.” I said. “They’re in trouble.”\n\n“You mean the Wilder's?\"\n\nSomething cold crept down my spine. “You know them?”\n\nHarvey shrugged. “I know of them.” He said. “They never come to school and have a crazy over- protective mother. My mom told me to stay away from them. It’s pretty much a universal rule in town not to talk to Wilder kids. I never see them anyway, so it’s not like it’s hard.”\n\n“That makes sense,” I said. “The police are in on it.”\n\nInclining his head, Harvey frowned. “In on what?”\n\nIt was only when I was holding the severed chord of our landline between my fingers when the gravity of the situation hit me—and the last thing I needed was to pull another kid into it. Harvey was like a puppy-dog, following me around. He was sitting cross legged on the carpet, his wide eyes glued to the phone cord. “That can’t be good,” he whistled. “Wait, what do you mean no police? Are you saying they’re dirty?”\n\nI stopped pacing the room, turning to him. \n\n\"Go home.”\n\nHarvey raised a brow. “That’s not going to happen.”\n\nI was too frustrated to argue with him. “I don’t care what you do,” I said through my teeth. “Just get as far away from here as possible.”\n\nHe groaned, resting his head in his arms. “So, you’re about to end up on some Netflix crime documentary, and you expect me to leave?”\n\n“I’m not in the mood for jokes,” I said, growing progressively more frustrated. “I need to find my mom, okay? I need to get out of this fucking town!”\n\n“Yeah, me too.” He lifted his head, shooting me a grin. “Just a few more months, and it’s NCU for me, baby. Full scholarship.”\n\nThere was something about Harvey which was bugging me. I twisted around to him. “Why are you here?”\n\nHe shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “I heard screaming.\"\n\n“No. I mean how did you get in?”\n\n“The door was open.” He wandered over to the kitchen table and poked my doll, but it didn’t move, staying on its back.  “Is this like… origami?”\n\n“Don’t touch that.” I said, and seeing my expression, he nodded and took a step back.\n\n“So, you just walked in?” I demanded.\n\nHis lip curled. “I’m sorry, did you want me to leave and ignore you? Ignore your high pitched murder screams?”\n\nInstead of yelling back at him, I forced my brain to think through the fog. Harvey was at risk of being pulled into Mrs Wilder’s dollhouse too if he stayed with me, but he was also not an adult. He would believe me about Mrs Wilder. I held my breath.  “Can I show you something?”\n\nHarvey shrugged. “It depends on what it is. I don’t do well with monsters, ghosts, anything from the back rooms or the dark web, or vampires except the chick from Resident Evil.” He dragged a hand through his hair. “Just pretty much anything freaky? Yeah, I don’t do well with freaky— and you look like you’re about to show me something super freaky.” He caught my eye, his lips curving into a smile. “Or this was all a misunderstanding, and you’re about to show me, like… buried treasure…” He trailed off when his gaze caught the bandage on my arm.  \n\nI hadn’t noticed my wound had opened up, intense red seeping through clinical white.\n\n“I’m fine.” I said.\n\n“Have you ever heard of septicaemia?” He mimed drawing his finger across his throat. “It’s the fancy word for blood poisoning.”\n\nI shook my head. “That doesn’t matter right now. I need to find my mom.”\n\n“Uh-huh. Cool, cool, cool. Or we could do the smart thing and, you know, call an adult?”\n\n“No,” I said. “The town are helping her.”\n\n“Helping her… do what?”\n\nA sliver slipped down my spine. There was no way I could describe what I had seen and expect Harvey to believe me.\n\nSo, I’d show him.\n\nGesturing him to follow me, I headed up to my bedroom. Harvey stuck by my side as I dived up the stairs.\n\n“So, are you going to tell you about the.. you know..” He pointed to his own face. “The scribbles.”\n\n“I’ll get to that.”\n\n“So, you’re telling me your neighbour is kidnapping kids and turning them into her children?”  \n\n“Dolls.”\n\nHarvey’s steps quickened. “Wait, what?”\n\nWhen I reached my room, I wasn’t surprised to find no sign of Casper when I hurried over and pressed my face against the glass of my window. Harvey hovered in the doorway before making his way over. “BTS.” He nodded at a poster on my wall. “How old are you again?”\n\n“That’s from my old house,” I said, relieved to be talking about something else. “The walls in here are too bare so say hello to thirteen year old Phoebe.”\n\n“Phoebe.” His lips quirked into a smile. “That’s your name. I definitely wasn’t waiting for you to tell me.”\n\nI shot him the first smile I’d had in days. “You sit in front of me for four months and can’t remember my name?”\n\n“Harsh.”\n\nHarvey joined me, pressing his face against the pane. “So. What exactly do you need to show me? It’s Friday night, and my friend's birthday. We're taking him to a club for the one-eight.\"\n\n“It’s Saturday.” I corrected him.\n\nHe turned to frown at me, and I noticed his jacket was looking progressively more dishevelled. “Wait, did I blank out my whole night?”\n\nPointing at Casper’s window, I ignored him. “This is what I wanted to show you.”\n\nI held my breath and waited for movement—and after maybe five minutes of staring out of the window like an idiot, I started to wonder if I truly was losing my mind. I was just looking progressively more crazy as I waited for movement which wasn’t going to come. \n\nI started to think bad thoughts. \n\nHad Mrs Wilder done something to him? She did say Casper was ‘sick’ and needed to be fixed, but what exactly did that mean?  Harvey turned to me, his lips curving into a smile. \n\n“So, what exactly am I supposed to be looking at? Because this feels kinda illegal.”\n\n“Wait for it.”\n\n“Wait for what?” He hissed. “You’re saying your neighbour kidnapped this kid? Wouldn’t she keep him in the basement?”\n\nOpening my mouth to answer him, the words dried up in my throat when there was a flicker of movement through the window. Casper appeared for a moment, stripping off his shirt and grabbing a towel before diving out of his room. I pulled back slowly, my heart in my throat. Again, it was like an illusion. He looked like a normal teenager heading into the shower, all of the stitches and rugged flesh gone.\n\nI expected Harvey to make a sly remark, but when I turned to him, the boy’s expression had completely contorted. “Fuck.” Harvey straightened up, hissing out. He looked like he was in pain for a second, before seemingly snapping out of it. “I know him,” he whispered. “I mean… I knew him? I think I knew him? Fuck. I don’t know!” I watched the boy pace my room, his hands clawing at his hair. The way he was acting reminded me of Casper's freak out. \n\n“I know him… but I also don’t? Jeez, I can’t remember. It feels like I’m being.. stabbed in the fucking head. Holy shit, my head is killing me. I must have overdone it.” Harvey choked out a hysterical laugh and turned to me, his lips stretched into a pained smile like he was struggling to understand what he was seeing. \"He was in my homeroom, and I said maybe two words to him.” My classmate let out a breath, rubbing the back of his head.“Phoebe, this might not be the best time to tell you this, but I’m pretty sure the boy next door is dead.” Harvey squinted. “He drowned.” He said, but his tone was almost questioning, like he wasn’t sure what he was saying.  “Last winter.”\n\nThere it was—and it was enough suck all of the oxygen from my lungs. I was waiting for the confirmation but it was still painful.\n\nThis agonising reality was like knives slicing into me. “We have a tradition every year. I mean, we’re a small town with a bunch of kids and life is boring, you know?” The more he was speaking, Harvey was looking progressively sicker, like he was about to collapse. But he pushed through, squeezing his eyes shut. \n\n“When the town lake freezes over, we carve our names into the ice for good luck. It’s a stupid tradition, but it means something to us—especially kids heading to college.” His eyes blinked open.  “Fuck. It’s like I completely… forgot about him.” Harvey shook his head.\n\n“Anyway. This guy. He was a golden boy, you know? Kind of a dick, but somehow got along with pretty much everyone. He was carving his name into the ice, and this little girl went straight through. So, naturally, he jumped in after her—but neither of them made it. The little girl’s body was found and his never was. So, naturally, the town went crazy and blamed him for not saving her.”\n\n“But he risked his life!” I found myself hissing out.\n\n“Yeah, try and tell that to a bunch of middle class suburban moms.”\n\n“Who were his parents?”\n\n“Just his mom. She was nice. I remember she used to hand out candy for all of us when we were in kindergarten. When her son died, she never came out of her house. Then people threw rocks at her windows, spray painting 'murderer' on her car.” He shook his head. “Even our school was told we weren’t going to mourn him, because he had caused the death of a little kid. His name was blacklisted. It was pretty fucked up. He didn't even have a funeral.\"\n\nHarvey prodded between his brows, his lips curling. \"The memorial his mom put in her yard was destroyed by this army of Karen’s insisting it was justice for the little girl’s death, when in reality nobody wanted to admit that it was parental neglect which killed her. The crazy bitches blamed it on him. They called him a murderer,  convinced he'd done it on purpose because of reports of seeing him dripping wet sitting on his mom's doorstep when she was looking for his body herself. She almost died from hyperthermia diving in there for him.\"\n\nHis mom, I thought dizzily.\n\nCasper, or whoever he was underneath the splintered doll… he had a mother who cared about him.\n\nWho loved him.\n\nHarvey rubbed at his eyes, and I noticed something smeared on the collar of his letterman jacket which hadn’t been there before.\n\n“What’s that on your jacket?”\n\nI don’t think he heard me. “They ran her out of town, and I completely… I forgot about it.”\n\n“You’re not saying his name,” I managed to get out, my attention going back to Casper. “Why aren’t you saying his name?”\n\nHarvey frowned. “I thought I did?”\n\n“You didn’t.” I pressed, my gut twisting at Harvey’s pained expression. “You told me everything but his name, and I want to know why.”\n\n “I… I don’t know.”\n\n“What do you mean you don’t know?” I snapped. Suddenly, I was desperate to know. “You said it yourself. He was in your class!”\n\n“I just forgot his name! That’s normal... right?” Harvey’s gaze caught movement in Casper’s window and he twisted to the window.\n\n“Holy shit, it is him.” He breathed, pressing his palm against the glass. “That’s the boy who drowned.”\n\nThe boy next door appeared once more, and Harvey’s eyes followed him—but  this time the chord-like thing was protruding from his head, his body more of a puppet. Casper on the edge of his bed, and my classmate turned to me, a feral twist of fear in his expression. My classmate’s eyes were glued to the thing burrowing its way into the back of Casper’s head with no mercy, while the boy next door stood very still, his eyes completely vacant. \n\nI thought they were looking through the window before I realised they were instead drinking in oblivion. He couldn't see me. \n\nGlimpsing Mrs Wilder’s shadow behind Casper’s door, I grabbed for Harvey’s arm, but I missed him and almost toppled over.\n\n“Duck!”\n\nThe two of us slammed into my carpet, and I pressed my face into the floor, struggling to breathe.\n\n“What...” Harvey finally turned to me with wide, almost unseeing eyes, and I was suddenly paying far too much attention to him, that rumbling question in my mind which had been driving me mad since he'd saved me. “What the fuck was that?”",

        "text": "Sitting on top of a craphouse in the middle of the night with a demonic two-headed bear creeping around below us really wasn't the outcome I'd hoped for that night. Casimir had regained some measure of control over himself. He pulled out his gun and took aim with steady hands. Just as he opened fire however, the beast let out another mad cry and started jumping and thrashing about before throwing itself against the side of the outhouse. It didn't even bother climbing, it simply decided to get us down. It was like it was playing with us.\n\n\nThe small structure shook and we were sent staggering, clinging onto each other to keep from falling. \n\n\n\"Get it in the head!\" I squeaked. \"Hurry!\"\n\n\n\"I can't!\" Cas yelled. \"It's moving around too much! Make it stay still!\"\n\n\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\" \n\n\nThe bear bashed against the small building once more. Both my brother and I screamed as the outhouse fell. The bear was getting ready to charge, muscles twitching beneath its shaggy fur. It let out another roar, and I took note of a lower, higher-pitched sound swinging along in it like an undercurrent. A cold chill ran down my spine when I realized it came from the second head. Cas shot blindly at the creature as the two of us scrambled across the frozen ground, trying to get some distance between ourselves and the beast. Before it was able to lunge at us though, something descended upon it from above. My eyes flew open when I recognized the half-tree, half-stag creature pressing the stunned bear to the ground. \n\n\n*\"Kill it! Now!\"* the Leshy bellowed. \n\n\nCasimir needed a mere second to break free from his shocked stupor. Then he took aim and fired, eyes stone-cold. After three shots, the bear fell limp. The Leshy loosened his grip on the beast and withdrew from its body with a long sigh. I clapped my brother on the shoulder, and he grabbed onto my arm as if to steady himself. \n\n\n\"Thank you, thank you so much,\" I uttered once I'd managed to catch my breath. \n\n\nTo my surprise, the Leshy's body began to quiver, spasming and contorting in a way that made my heart sink. For a moment, I considered the possibility of the Bies having taken possession of the wood-demon now. But when he fell still and straightened up before us in his human form, I realized that he had merely allowed us to witness a transformation of his. \n\n\n\"I thought you were a menace on your own, Fiona, but together with this foolish milksop, you could end not only these woods but the whole world altogether,\" he said. His words, despite their decidedly hostile nature, held little tonal venom. He wasn't actually angry with us, I could tell.\n\n\nI was surprised once again when Cas stepped forth, extending his hand. \"I'm Casimir. I'm Fiona's younger brother.\"\n\n\nThe Leshy left his hand hanging in the air for a few awkward seconds before taking it. I've never seen a handshake *look sarcastic*, but somehow, this one did. \"I gathered,\" the Lord of the woods returned, shouldering his cudgel. \"It's only the Novak kids who could muff things up this much. Are you two trying to get yourselves killed? Because that is how you'll get yourselves killed.\"\n\n\n\"Oh come on, you know it wasn't exactly easy!\" I protested. \"Also, I'm trying to protect you here. How would you have gone about this? Please, enlighten me.\"\n\n\nA smile tugged on the wood-demon's lips, though he was visibly attempting to hide it. \"All right, don't go stomping your little feet and yelling at me now; I feel like I'm being assaulted by a mad poodle.\"\n\n\nCas snorted. \"You do look a bit like a poodle in that puffy dress,\" he remarked in a whisper.\n\n\n\"Oh no, you don't get to be saucy, boy,\" the Leshy warned. \"Not when you're shaking like a leaf in front of me, thinking I won't notice. I smell fear, child, and you reek of it, no matter how hard you play the daredevil.\" He smirked. \"And your hands are as soft as a lady's glove.\"\n\n\nI broke into a laugh, the pent-up nervous energy finally draining from my body. \n\n\nMy brother, blushing furiously, piped up again. \"Just a second, I'm gonna assume that you are—\"\n\n\n\"The name's Aleksei,\" the Leshy suddenly said, a warmth in his tone unlike anything I'd ever heard from him before. \n\n\nFor a moment, I was stunned. \"You're called Aleksei? Why'd you never tell me that?\"\n\n\n\"You never asked.\" He shrugged. “Anyways, you two ought to be glad I stuck around the homestead. Maybe next time, let me know in advance so I don’t have to intervene at the very last second. But I know what you’ve been doing back there, and for what it’s worth, I’m…” He grimaced as if he was about to give voice to a thought that disagreed with his very nature. “Grateful… for, well, that. You actually came through for me.”\n\n\nDeciding not to make the moment any more difficult for this prideful creature, I smiled and gave him a brief nod.\n\n\n“I’m thinking maybe we should stick together,” he gritted out, like he was trying the words on for size. “I’d feel safer and I could keep *you* safe. I’m not much of a team player, so this isn’t exactly easy for me, but…” He trailed off, regarding me with probing eyes. \n\n\nI suppressed a very, very wide smile. “Would it be easier for you if I asked you for help? Something like, *please, Sir, protect us?*” \n\n\nThe Leshy (Aleksei?) threw his head back, glancing heavenward as if to ask what he had done to be punished in such a manner. “I’m not that vain,” he grunted. “And you’d do well not to disrespect me, wench. I've saved your life twice now, and I could break your bones like twigs.”\n\n\n“But you’re not gonna,” I said softly. \n\n\nHe tilted his head. “No,” he replied quietly. “No, of course not.”\n\n\n“Okay, so we’re all friends now?” Casimir asked, bouncing back and forth on his heels. “What’s our next step here? That thing, the Bies… I’m just gonna be the first one to say it scares the shit out of me.”\n\n\n“Normally, I’d just call in a priest but I guess that’s not gonna work,” I added. “So, uh, Aleksei, any ideas whatsoever? I mean, you’re more like that thing than us…” Calling him by his name was simply awkward, and I decided not to do it again for a while. I motioned for us to get moving, starting off into the direction of the house once more. The Leshy followed reluctantly. \n\n\n“There’s not much I can tell you about that,” he replied. “The only reason I know what a Bies is in the first place is because this isn’t the first time I’ve met one. When I was really little… before we came here, that is…” He trailed off, lost in thought.\n\n\n“Who’s we?”\n\n\n“Unimportant. We didn’t kill that one either though, we basically just fled from it. But as for similarities between that creature and myself, I suppose neither of us is very manipulatable by spiritual energies. Yes, we both avoid religious items, but we can’t be killed by someone reading from a bible. We’re a little less sensitive in that aspect, but we also aren’t as powerful and a lot more vulnerable.”\n\n\n“There’s no big Daddy-type who has your back,” Cas offered, and the Leshy touched a fingertip to his nose. \n\n\n“Exactly. If the black miller needs assistance, he has his master to fall back on. I don’t. But I’ve also sworn myself to nobody. There’s no higher entity I need to answer to. God has cast out me and those like me, so we can’t, say, cross a threshold if it’s been blessed, but we also can’t be destroyed by a cross being shoved in our faces.”\n\n\n“So we’d need to trap that thing somehow,” I thought aloud, feeling myself get more excited by the second as an idea slowly began to worm its way into my foggy mind.\n\n\n“We really ought to discuss that inside,” Cas remarked.\n\n\nI started skipping, unable to suppress the spring that had suddenly entered my step. Once the three of us found ourselves inside my own living room, the Leshy looking around with furrowed brows, the words came spilling from my lips like a fountain. “So it can switch between bodies freely, right? If there was a way we could trap it inside a body though, and then either trap or kill that body, we could destroy it cleanly, once and for all. I know demons from hell can be trapped with a pentagram! I’ve seen Jacek do it.” To the Leshy, I added, “The black miller, you know? That's his name. He used my blood for a ritual on our first date.”\n\n\n“That constitutes a date for you?” Cas threw in.\n\n\n“Sure it does. Well, kinda. Doesn’t matter. But if you earth spirits can be manipulated using religious symbolism, too, that’d mean we could use that to trap the Bies inside of a body. Once it can’t leave anymore, we kill the body, and then it won’t be able to use it anymore, but it can’t exit it either. We know it’s not able to animate corpses, otherwise it wouldn’t leave the animals it uses behind once they’re dead. We’d basically be imprisoning the Bies forever. At least until the body has rotted away completely, but we don’t have to let it come to that.”\n\n\n“We could make a kind of blessed coffin,” Casimir suggested readily. “Sounds dumb, but—\"\n\n\n“No, no, I know what you mean,” I interrupted him. \n\n\n“How do you intend to mark the body as blessed, though?” Aleksei inquired, stroking his beard. “Because it needs to be alive before the Bies enters it, and it has to be blessed when the demon is already inside.”\n\n\n“That’s the tricky part,” I said. “It’ll be an icky affair, but hey, that’s what knives are for.\"\n\n\n\"What happened to you, gentle soul? I remember how you used to loathe bloodshed,\" the Leshy remarked.\n\n\n\"I still do. But it's necessary.\"\n\n\n\"So we're expecting a bit of a fight, are we?\" Cas asked, wiping his brow. \"Sucks, but I'm up for it. I think.\"\n\n\n\"Me too,\" Aleksei said comfortably, petting the couch cushion he was sitting on.\n\n\n\"We'll need to be quick about it, though. I bet we've made it pretty angry,\" I remarked. \"It's probably out for revenge, and we've got to use whatever advantage that we got from smoking out its hideout. And we've got to be prepared for it to try and take possession of us, as well. That should be easy enough, though. We just all wear crosses and it'll be alright.\"\n\n\n\"And what about me?\" the Leshy inquired.\n\n\n\"Oh, right,\" I mumbled. \"I didn't think of that. Do you think you're strong enough to fend it off again? It'll definitely be a great risk, but you've done it every time thus far.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know. I didn't want to say this but I've gotten far sicker these last couple days.\" He sighed, burying his face in his palms. \"I can feel the infection eating away at me.\"\n\n\nI considered him with a tilted head. His affliction wasn't comparable to any one I'd ever known, but I figured it would do him some good to rest inside where it was warm and cozy. I extended the offer of staying over and he very reluctantly accepted. Seeing as it was rather late at this point, we figured depriving ourselves of sleep would do none of us any good. I went back up to my room. My whole body was aching and I had half a mind to fall asleep right away, but my thoughts were still running wild.\n\n\nDespite myself, I found my fingers fumbling for my phone again. I typed and deleted the message to Jacek thrice before finally sending it.\n\n\n*\"Are you still up?\"*\n\n\nThe reply came almost immediately. **\"Seem to be, yes. How did it go?\"**\n\n\n*\"Good enough. No one died.\"*\n\n\nHe sent a smiley. **\"I'm glad.\"**\n\n\n*\"We've also come up with something of a plan. I'm pretty optimistic.\"*\n\n\n**\"I wanna hear. I know it's late but call me?\"**\n\n\nMy heart leapt, and it did so once again when he picked up and greeted me with an adorably sleepy voice. I told him about our scheme and he said it sounded just fine. \n\n\n\"The only thing you haven't mentioned yet, how are you going to set the trap?\" he argued. \"I mean, how are you going to motivate the Bies to possess the body you're going to use as bait? And what body is that even going to be? Will you just watch out for the thing to take over another creature and fight that? Or are you going to pick something out? And if you do, what's it gonna be? It's gotta be something that's easy enough to fight, so a weaker kind of animal would do nicely, but the Bies isn't likely to attempt to possess that. Not if it's out for your blood.\"\n\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" I replied, chewing on my bottom lip. \"What do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"A human would certainly be more appealing to it. It could do more damage in a human form, I think. Especially since it would allow it to, like, sneak up on people. I don't know if the Bies is actually going to possess a human next, or if it even has enough of a mind to consider the pros and cons, but… I would.\" \n\n\n\"M-hm. So we'd need a human sacrifice, is what you're saying?\" \n\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\n\"I really don't wanna do that.\"\n\n\n\"Understandable, but if you want to bait it, that's your only option. And it also begs the question *who* you'd be using.\" He paused, and I could practically hear him smile. \"There is, of course, a rather attractive option—\"\n\n\n\"Tom Hayes,\" I muttered. \n\n\n“Precisely. How about him? He’s responsible for several deaths. Besides, he did capture your soul, by means still unknown to us. And he tried to blackmail you, he spread news about your property, abused your trust; the list goes on.”\n\n\n\"Yeah but what if he's not actually in his right mind? The Bies can plant ideas in people's heads; what if Tom Hayes has been influenced by it? That'd make more sense than him just being a deranged murderer.\"\n\n\nJacek sighed. \"Don't turn your mind over with all of that. That only makes it harder to follow through. How are you gonna choose a human to kill like that? It's as if you're looking for reasons not to.\"\n\n\n\"No shit,\" I snorted. \"Do I have any other options, though?\"\n\n\nHe hummed. \"Technically, you do. But they involve me. You could always ask nicely and then I could bring you up a sinner, is what I'm saying.\" His gruff voice had an amused edge to it. \"But that would leave you with the question of what to do with Hayes when this is all over.\"\n\n\n\"I guess so.\" I groaned, stretching in bed. \"I'll sleep on it. So what are you doing right now?\" I asked, trying to get my mind off the murder-stuff for the moment. \n\n\n\"I'm taking a bath, actually. Got a death grip on the phone here.\" He let out a chuckle that sent a warm shiver up my spine.\n\n\n\"Brave,\" I remarked. \"So you got your own place?\"\n\n\n\"Of course. I'm hella messy, though. I could never let you see it. I oughta be embarrassed, really.\"\n\n\nThat kind of got us talking and I ended up falling asleep with him still on the phone. I realized that when I woke up to a text from him mocking how I allegedly snored. I took some time this morning to think about everything and clear my head. The Leshy is snoozing on my couch, which is definitely weird, especially since he's in his \"true\" form again. What's more concerning is how small he's gotten. He actually fits into my living room. I don't want to know what's going to happen to the woods if he really were to die.\n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10b1dy9/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cac2n/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10dbk6i/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_devil/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ebyr1/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_the_sauna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Part 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fa2ec/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_how_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "I imagine God looks down on Earth the same way I looked down on my pancakes this morning: utter disgust. I couldn't eat (*I can't eat).* My priest suggested therapy, and my therapist suggested a priest. Ironic, ain't it? \n\nThe past few nights, I've been having this dream. Yet, it felt too real to be fake. I could see, hear, smell...Hell, I could feel what was happening. Some nights I've woken up with my leg or arm still tingling from what happened the night before. The only constant I have is the time I wake up from these dreams and the inevitable feeling that something, someone, is watching me. It usually goes like this: \n\nI open my eyes to the sound of radio static coming from outside my car window. The night sky was looming over me with the same feeling of loneliness that's consumed me since Amelia died. The intense bright lights of the fast-food Chinese restaurant contrasted with the dark and empty town. Not a light could be seen for miles, and the only thing I could hear was that damn radio static. I rolled down the window and tried to order some food. \n\n\"Hello?\" I politely said, but there was no response, only radio static. \"Um, are you guys open?\" I asked again. Still no response. *They must be closed*, I thought while muttering obscenities under my breath. I drove all the way out here for nothing. Instead of pitying myself over some Americanized Kung Pao Chicken, I decided to accept defeat and eat whatever was left in my apartment. No one was behind me, and it didn't seem like anyone was awake at this hour, so I took a couple of seconds to turn on the radio. When I pressed the worn-out \"power on/volume\" dial, only radio static came out. \n\n\"What is going on right now?\" I asked myself. \"Fine, no music.\" I sighed. As I made my way out of the parking lot, I noticed there was no exit. In fact, the only place I could drive to was this closed hotel. Before I had time to yell or scream, I got a call on my phone. \n\n**\"\"AMELIA\"\"**\n\nIt said in bold letters. But that's not possible. I quickly answer the phone and was ready to fight. \n\n\"If this is some sick joke, I hope you know that-\"\n\n\"John?\" The soft, familiar voice of Amelia asked. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I clutched my phone like a bible. \n\n\"Sweetheart?\" I responded. \"How is this possible?\"\n\n\"Sweetie. Where do you think you are?\" She asked. \n\n\"I- I'm in town. I went to get some food but-\"\n\n\"No.\" She sternly stated in a much deeper voice than before. \"Where do you think you are?\" \n\nI looked up and read the hotel sign.\n\n**\"\"SKUNCUIOXIEF\"\"** \n\n\"I can't read it. It's not in English.\" I said. \"Where am I?\" My voice shook with every word. My body felt cold, ice cold. Radio static surrounded my car. The looming feeling of loneliness was replaced with fear. I wasn't alone, and yet I couldn't see beyond the blackened windows and lifeless buildings in front of me. \n\n\"It's okay, dear!\" Amelia excitedly assured me. \"Sometimes God falls asleep, and an angel ends up in the wrong place.\" The radio static outside grew louder. \n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Hopefully, someone will find you. Hopefully, He'll wake up.\" \n\n**And then I woke up.** \n\nNormally this wouldn't be a big deal. Grief comes with stress, and stress brings nightmares. But every night, when I finally wake up, it's exactly 3:58 am. The hairs on the back of my neck are already standing at attention. One night, I swear I could feel something reaching out to me. Again, I chalked this up to just normal grieving emotions manifesting themselves in a messed-up manner. My subconscious was just sabotaging me. \n\nAt this point, I looked forward to my dreams. Though they leave me with an unsettling pit in my stomach,  it gives me a chance to hear her voice again. She speaks to me, and it feels like we're having a real conversation (even if that convo is about my future demise). Maybe nightmares weren't so bad...at least, I think they're nightmares. \n\nLast night I drifted off to sleep at 9:30 pm. I knew I would be awoken at the same time, so I tried going to bed earlier in case I couldn't fall back asleep. But something was off about this dream. \n\nI opened my eyes to a dark road with nothing behind me and nothing ahead. I was driving my car, but I didn't really have a destination in mind. Simply, I was driving. Not a star could be seen in the night sky, and it looked as if my only comfort would be acres of corn that filled fields parallel to me. Though odd, I didn't question it. Amelia was bound to call me, and I wanted to hear her voice. But my phone didn't ring. In fact, there was no sound at all. There wasn't even radio static. I tried to turn on the radio, but there was nothing. I rolled down my window, yet I heard nothing. \n\nAfter a minute or two of searching for sound, the low-gas light turned on in my car. \"Damn, even in dreams, I don't get good gas mileage,\" I said to myself. As quickly as I noticed the gas, I found myself at exactly where I needed to be. Up ahead, I saw the familiar bright lights of a local gas station. It only had two pumps and a small convenience store. There seemed to be no other cars in sight, not even the owners, but I decided to stop anyways. When I exited my car, I felt the wind brush against my cheek like the familiar hand that reached out to me some nights ago. A chill ran across my body, and I looked up from the pump and towards the cornfield in front of me. Still, there was nothing I could see. There was nothing I could hear. I could only feel the invisible eyes of something watching me. \n\nThat's when the ticking started. Radio static wasn't so bad, and the silence was ominous. But this ticking sound was insidious. \n\nTick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Then nothing. I stayed by my car, the gas was pumping slower than molasses. \n\nTick, tick, tick. Then nothing. I finally had enough gas. \n\nTick, tick. Then nothing. I opened the door to my car. \n\nTick. Then nothing. I was in my car, and the doors were locked. \n\nNothing. There were no ticks, no radio; I was back to silence. As I buckled my seatbelt, I felt something behind me. That is when I made the worst mistake since a hotdog eating contest in college. My eyes approached the rearview mirror; I held my breath and put the key in the ignition with shaky hands. \n\nNothing was there*.* \n\nTick, then nothing. \n\nWhen I lowered my gaze, I caught a glimpse of the creature stalking me. Eyes wide open like a man gone mad. Skin as grey as gravel. A nose bent sideways. Its smile was as wide as its cheeks, with hundreds of teeth in all directions. It matched my breathing, and when it slowed down, I did too. The thing crawled up my car on all fours with its talon-like feet. The neck of the beast twisted as it tried to get a better view of its prey. I closed my eyes shut, begging God to wake me up. \n\n*Wake up!* I thought. *Please, please wake up!* Though no doors were open, I could feel it enter my car. Its breath was ice cold, and every muscle in my body tensed up. \n\n**And thank god I woke up.** \n\nI shot up in my slumber, my eyes fixated on the bedside table. *3:58 am.* The silence in my room was comforting. For the first time, I felt as though nothing was watching me. \n\nBefore going back to sleep, a notification appeared on my phone. It was probably work; some of those guys are weirdly ambitious. So, I drifted off to sleep as if nothing had happened. The next morning, I was fixing my coffee and checking the notifications. \n\n**\"\"AMELIA\"\"** \n\nIt read across the screen. The number must have been transferred already. That's the only explanation. I opened up the message, expecting it to be someone who butt-dialed me. Hell, I even thought someone was playing a cruel prank on me. Whatever it was, I was ready to send something along the lines of \"hey, this is my dead fiance's number; please don't text me again.\" Yet the message left me with more questions than answers. \n\n\"He's finally awake!\" The message read. \"He can finally see you!\" \n\n*What the hell?* I thought to myself. But before I could respond, the hairs on my neck stood up again. Just like before, my breath shortened, my hands were shaking, and the air felt heavy. \n\nTick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Then nothing.",

        "text": "Ok everyone... So, big spoiler: my husband is, indeed, dead. And I don't think whoever has been living with me is his ghost. \n\nLet's start from the beginning. If you read my last post, you know I found a death certificate belonging to my husband... From 20 years ago. This wouldn't be weird if... Well, if he hadn't made breakfast for me this morning. \n\nSince then, I received a lot of advice, so I decided to postpone my plan of escaping and dig into it. No pun intended.\n\nA lot of you asked me if I was sure the death certificate was real. I was mostly sure it was. I looked at it several times. It said he was married and had my full name under spouse, right address, right data... I was listed as the informant of death, which is weird because I don't recall any of this. At all. No matter how hard I try. It lists he died at the hospital and was buried in his parents' town, at the local cemetery. \n\nI called the funerary agency listed and asked if they could send me the paperwork related to his funeral, to which they replied it had to be requested in person to verify my identity, which I can't do because my \"husband\" would suspect my absence. \n\nSo I took the certificate to the local police station. I asked if I could see the records. The officer looked at me with pain:\n\n-Oh miss Smith... We never caught whoever shot Jim's car, it's a cold case, but we can't disclose the files without an authorization, I'm sorry. \n\nAnd added\n\n-Man, I do miss Jim... How have you been doing? I see you sometimes but you always seem to ignore me. I believe you're mad at us for not finding the killer, and I can't blame you, so I never brought myself to talk to you... \n\nI was dazed. I've never talked to this man before, why is he being so familiar? Also... The killer? What killer? Wasn't this a car accident? \n\nI looked at the certificate in my hand. Sure enough, the cause of death was listed as murder. I was just so sure of what killed him that I never looked at it. And what did he mean by missing him? Did they know each other? Exactly how much did I forget? \n\n-Hey, huh... I had a mould situation at home, and the pictures I had of Jim were damaged... Do you have at least one in the file you could give me? That's all I want. \n\nHe looked around to make sure nobody was watching him and shot a quick \"wait here\". \n\nHe came back with a photo and a newspaper cut-out. As he gave me these, I felt a chill that froze me in place. \n\nI don't know this man in the picture. I have absolutely no recollection of him. I can swear I never saw him. And I can swear he's in none of the pictures that decorate my house or lay in the albums.\n\nThe picture in the newspaper showed the same man. The same face unknown to me. Along with a last phrase that made me sure I *need* to find out what's going on:\n\n*\"Jim Smith departed in the arms of his wife, Allison Smith, and the couple's baby daughter, Elisa Smith\"*",

        "text": "  \"Lost in the woods,\" was a phrase my father used a lot. When I was young; should we be out in the world and witness someone acting out in any way,\n\n  \"That boy's lost in the woods,\" he'd say, shaking his head in that parental disappointment sort of manner, even if they weren't his child. \n\n  When I reached my early teens, struggling to find my place amongst my peers, \n\n  \"You're lost in the woods, kid,\" he'd say, in a far more sympathetic and compassionate manner. \n\n  I endured some hard times over the years, while I tried to find where I belonged in the world, but my dad was always there for me. Though I wasn't exactly an outdoorsy type, his words were always reassuring, even if I hoped to never be caught dead in a forest, let alone lost in one. \n\n  We would inevitably talk about my problems after he would diagnose my symptoms in his own special way, but I learned to understand how the same saying would read differently, depending on the situation. \n\n  Even during those last few weeks, he battled against the cancer devouring him from the inside out, he too was 'lost in the woods'. I like to think that when he passed; when his suffering reached its end, he finally saw what lay beyond the trees. \n\n  I suppose it was only fitting that it was as I drove home from his funeral that I found myself in a far more literal version of his all-purpose metaphor. Over that time, I became certain I would be joining my old man outside the borders of the forest, so soon after he made the trip himself. \n\n  I had chosen not to ride with my mom and stepfather, Dale, as I wanted to be alone with my thoughts. I didn't have a problem with my mother's husband; he'd always treated me well enough. My parents had remained close after the divorce, as they both agreed they were always better friends than lovers. \n\n  Dad got along with his replacement better than most under such circumstances, but it always felt like Dale tried a little too hard when my old man was around. It may have been nothing more than the inherent jealousy a man feels towards his significant other's ex. Maybe he had some insecurities about the situation, but Pop and I would laugh about it when we were alone. \n\n  I was always tight with my dad; far more so than anyone else in my life. With him being the one I would turn to when I needed to talk, I wanted to be alone on this one. I think I needed to. Had I ridden with my mom, Dale would've likely tried his damndest to get me to talk about how I was feeling, which was not remotely ready to do. \n\n  Even when the rain began to pour down from above, I was mostly mentally checked out as I guided my car from one road to the next. The spot in which my dad wanted to be buried was some miles into the next state over; the one he grew up in before relocating, back in the day. While the path I traversed that day was somewhat unfamiliar, my subconscious was able to focus on the road while my mind drifted beyond the confines of my old Chevy. \n\n  I suppose that's why it took me a moment to register the truck ahead of me, sharply veering into the other lane. By the time I noticed where the road had split, opening a wide fissure in the tarmac, I didn't have a chance to miss it. The collision, for lack of a better term for skidding into a large gap in the pavement, happened so quickly that I was only vaguely aware of what was happening before everything went black. \n\n  The heavy rainfall we had been experiencing, off and on, for weeks, had led to a few of these fissures forming across the state. Be it from poorly maintained roads or simply years of water seeping between the cracks, I couldn't say. It wasn't exactly my area of expertise or anything. \n\n  I remember my dad saying, sometime over that previous month or so, that the cities would be buried beside him by the time the dust settled. Maybe it was the medication talking, but he feared that Hell itself may be reaching through the cracks; stretching its tendrils through the very foundation of reality, to claim this world for its own, one stretch of road at a time. \n\n  When my eyes blinked back to awareness, my dramatic shift in surroundings caught me off guard, at first. While I had been at the helm of my old Chevy when I blacked out, the fact that I found myself laying splayed out on the floor of an unfamiliar forest took me a moment to fully grasp. \n\n  The rain had stopped, leading me to believe I must have been out of it for a while, but when I pressed my palms to the ground to find it wasn't even damp, I began to question my sanity. \n\n  \"You're lost in the woods, kid,\" I heard echoing from the back of my mind as I hesitantly raised from the dirt to trembling and weakened legs. \n\n  Attempting to rationalize my relocation while I slept, I assumed that someone must have pulled me from my likely crumpled car, before dragging me into the middle of the woods that stood beside the road I was traversing. Why anyone would do this, I couldn't quite fathom. \n\n  \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"more cracks opened up, so someone carried me in here. Perhaps they thought the road wasn't safe, so they dropped me off before going for help.\" \n\n  Not the most likely rationalization, but it was something. \n\n  While I gazed around my newfound surroundings, seeking out any indication of which direction would lead me back to the road, I became more aware of the unsettling silence. Being the middle of winter, the bare, skeletal trees, and dead leaves lining the forest floor didn't feel out of place, but I could find no evidence of anything else alive out there. \n\n  Glancing upward, the blank and gray sky appeared as lifeless as the world around me. I couldn't even feel a breeze. While I still wore the suit I donned for my father's funeral; one that wasn't exactly made for winter weather, it wasn't as chilly as I would've expected. It wasn't warm either, mind you, but everything felt wrong, somehow. \n\n  The colors looked muted, in a way. The bark of the trees was an almost sickly, grayish-brown. The discarded leaves scattered across the ground were more yellowed and diseased looking than what I would've expected.  Even the drab sky felt more like a ceiling over the woods, than a vast emptiness, adding a strange sense of claustrophobia to my already scattered senses.  \n\n  While all I could hear was my heartbeat against the inner walls of my ears, the crunching beneath my feet when I finally took a step almost caused me to recoil. Being out in the wilderness, surrounded by such emptiness and quiet was far more unsettling to me than how I ended up here in the first place.\n\n  I was in a daze while I trudged onward in no particular direction. With only more stripped-down trees being all I could make out in any direction, I had no way of knowing which potential path would be the right one. Regardless of my uncertainty, I knew I had to keep moving. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I had the strangest sense of urgency, assuring me that I must reach the border of this forest as quickly as possible. \n\n  The scenery remained unchanging, even after walking for what felt like a few hours. At the beginning of my stroll, I'd fished my phone out of my pocket, only to see the broken screen and the absence of any backlight or life behind the shattered glass. Given that the last thing I remembered before waking in this place was crashing into a damn hole in the world, it wasn't hard to accept that my device had not survived, even if my body was somehow unscathed. \n\n  I have no idea how much time had passed when the humming sound began. That's about the best way I can describe it; a hum that started soft, growing steadily louder, as if something was approaching. Had it not been for the almost suffocating quiet of my surroundings, I likely wouldn't have even noticed it until it engulfed me, if that was indeed its intent. \n\n  For all I knew, the unsettling vibration that accompanied it, was something good; something I should approach, rather than run from. Ultimately, I wasted no time deliberating the options, opting to transform my stroll into an outright sprint for my life. With the noise originating from behind me, I could only hope that speeding away from it was the right call. \n\n  To fully illustrate where my head was at the time, I think I assumed that I had landed in some sort of purgatory, somewhere between life and death after the accident. Being that I saw no sign of the road I had quite literally crashed into, it seemed a reasonable assumption.\n\n  With that working theory; that I must escape these woods to reclaim my mortal shell, my immediate fear was that the sound belonged to that which would send me to whatever afterlife awaited me. That, or it was something far more sinister, perhaps intent on leading me to the gates of Hell itself. \n\n  When a subtle mist joined the ambient and elevating hum, gently caressing the forest floor beneath my quickly tiring legs, I grew far more certain I had to escape whatever was happening. While I ached from head to toe; something that somewhat contradicted my theory of being absent of living flesh at the time, my frenzied thoughts were interrupted by the ground shifting to a steep downward slant. \n\n  For the briefest moment, I felt weightless as my feet found nothing to land on, slipping on the dried leaves when they finally did make contact. I was so caught off guard, having been otherwise occupied by both my surroundings and the oncoming storm, for lack of a better term, my mind fought as much as my flailing limbs while I tumbled towards more uncertainty.  \n\n  If nothing else, when my fall came to an end, with my body splayed out, face down on another unfamiliar bed of dried leaves, the humming vibrations felt further off, again. My mind fought to remain conscious as the dizziness of my quickly-paced descent caused the world to spin around me, but I could not allow myself to pass out here, not with whatever was pursuing me. \n\n  As I pushed my palms against the ground, struggling to get somewhat upright before the darkness could swallow me whole, something happened that most certainly brought my wavering consciousness back to my dire circumstances. \n\n  \"Stay down, friend,\" the stranger, who seemingly appeared out of nowhere said, pushing me back down by the shoulder. \n\n  Regardless of his encouragement, I landed hard, having completely lost my footing being surprised by the unexpected touch. \n\n  \"What? Who the fu…\"\n\n  \"Shhh,\" he said, crouching down beside where I now sat, \"just let it drift on by.\"\n\n  I followed his gaze back up the steep hill I had tumbled down, to see that dense, white fog lining the woods above like a cloud.\n\n  While I had assumed the unusual mist to be something chasing after me, the full weight of that irrational thought didn't sink in until I watched it shift directions, some thirty feet above. While it was so thick, it almost reassembled an enormous, sentient, cotton ball, it had ripples throughout, like waves running against the direction of a stream, spiraling endlessly as it hovered in place.   \n\n  It was somewhat confusing to look upon, the way it jerked one way, with the bizarre rapids flowing backward, but it was clear that some sort of consciousness guided it. After it pulled to the right and left, swaying this way and that, it finally came to a halt, spinning around and around, as though waiting for something, or someone, in this case. \n\n  While I didn't know whether or not I should trust my new companion, his reassuring grip on my shoulder helped more than I could understand at the time. Though I hadn't looked at him yet, just having someone by my side, after hours of solitude, trudging through this seemingly never-ending forest, encouraged me to remain as still as possible. \n\n  We both continued to glare upwards, even after the fog began to dissipate, before drifting back the way it came. For some minutes after its retreat, I was scared to move a muscle, even after the stranger let his grip on my shoulder slip free. \n\n  \"Should be okay. For now, anyway,\" he said, lifting himself back from the ground. \n\n  \"What was that?\" I asked, getting to my feet. \n\n  Finally having the opportunity to take in the appearance of this man, I felt a little more at ease, noticing the uniform he was wearing. It was similar to a police outfit, but one I recognized as more of a Park Rangers garb. I hadn't spent a lot of time in such places over the years, but I was certain that's what it was, plus it fit, considering our location. \n\n  He looked a little older than me, thin, but in decent shape. He pulled his wide-brimmed hat from his short, brown hair, wiping his sweating brow with the back of his forearm. He had a neatly trimmed beard, a few shades darker than his hair, and stood a couple of inches taller than me. \n\n  \"Nothin' you wanna get caught up in,\" he said, placing the hat back in place, \"that's a damn fact.\"\n\n  He looked back at me, giving me a small smile. It was then that I noticed that his eyes were an almost translucent, sky blue. Though I assumed he was likely wearing some sort of novelty contacts, or something, they were still almost mesmerizing. \n\n  Of course, given the fact that everything around us was so lifeless, drowned in muted, depressing colors, it may have been nothing more than the stark contrast of something so lively amid everything else appearing so lifeless and cold. \n\n  \"Tucker,\" he said, holding a hand out, \"Maxwell Tucker; Ranger Tuck, 'round these parts.\" \n\n  \"Nathan Solomon, um, Nate,\" I replied, shaking his hand. \n\n  \"Nice to meet ya, Nate. Let's get movin', yeah?\" \n\n  \"Yeah.\"\n\n  The more we talked as we walked onward, continuing in the direction I was going; something I wasn't entirely sure of, considering that my tumble had potentially altered my trajectory, the more I felt comfortable with the guy. \n\n  His voice had a friendly tone. There was something warm and inviting about it, like I was chatting with an old friend, rather than someone I had only just met. He spoke of strange occurrences in these woods; woods I had apparently been alongside when the road swallowed up my car. \n\n  While I didn't want to get into said strange occurrences, being that I was already freaked out by everything, I still couldn't figure out how I had ended up here, so far from my likely totaled Chevy. \n\n  \"Likely,\" Ranger Tuck said, \"it dragged you in here, deep into the heart of it. Wouldn't be the first time.\"\n\n  \"It? I mean, it, who?\" \n\n  \"Folks 'round here just call it the Gray. It seems to enjoy messin' with folks; the ones it don't finish off right away, anyway.\" \n\n  \"Wait,\" I said, stopping in place, \"so, some guy screws with people, leaves them for dead, or just straight out kills them!?\"\n\n  He just tilted his head with a shrug. \n\n  \"And that's okay? Like, the police won't do anything about it? You Rangers just let it continue? Some sick bastard is loose out there, and you guys…\" \n\n  \"Never said it was a man. It ain't exactly somethin' that fits into normal conversation, y'know? Naw, friend; this ain't nothin' natural, sneakin' through the cracks. Can't say what it is, but it ain't bound by our laws.\" \n\n  \"Okay,\" I said, attempting to push aside my disbelief for the time, \"why all this then? Why drag me, God knows how far into this damned place, only to leave me to wander around?\" \n\n  \"It likes games, for whatever reason. It enjoys the hunt; the chase. We've been able to save some, but most end up the same way, whether it does it right off the bat, or after makin' them think they got a chance. S'pose it depends on what kinda mood it's in at the time. Could be you just got lucky.\"\n\n  \"Lucky? Are you serious? I crashed my car, ended up in the middle of this dismal freaking forest, and damn near broke my legs running from a cloud, which I can't even believe I'm saying with a straight face. What the hell should I feel lucky about!?\" \n\n  \"You found me,\" he said, with a smirk and a wink, \"so, you ready to get outta here, or what?\"\n\n  While I can't say this especially put me at ease, his carefree expression did make me feel better about things. Yes, it would seem I was only one of many to fall victim to 'the Gray', whatever the hell that was, but Ranger Tuck had seemingly witnessed what this thing was capable of, and lived to tell the tale. I had to believe I was in good hands. \n\n  I still didn't speak much as we plundered onward, but I did feel hopeful that I would see the other side of this. Given that neither the accident nor the tumble down the hill left me as beaten and bruised as they could have, maybe my wandering companion was right; perhaps I was lucky. \n\n  That's what I began to believe, anyway, right before the fear took hold of me once more. \n\n  \"Run!\" Tuck said, having noticed the approaching fog before I did. \n\n  When I grew aware of that humming sound once more, my heartbeat quickened faster than my feet, at first.\n\n  Though we did as he demanded; both of us sprinting as hard as our legs were capable of, those smoky tendrils began to wrap around our surroundings, weaving between and around the trees on both sides. It almost felt as though it was attempting to flank us; to force us forward, rather than allowing us to veer or separate. \n\n  \"Don't slow down!\" the ranger called out, noticing the power behind my strides dwindling. \n\n  I was doing everything I could to force one leg in front of the other, but when the sound of the thick bark cracking and splitting reached my ears, it took everything I had to remain upright, let alone continue charging onward. \n\n  I felt the fingers of my companion wrapping around my wrist, as he pulled me alongside him. How he still had so much strength in his extremities, I had no clue, but his encouragement and support succeeded in filling me with more purpose and drive to keep charging toward the hope of freedom. \n\n  \"Don't let up,\" he said, not so much as glancing from the path ahead, \"we can make it, just keep pushin'! You can rest when we get outta here.\" \n\n  Regardless of his determination, the sight of those wispy tentacles now weaving themselves around the trees ahead assured me that our options were running out. \n\n  As the misty fingers entwined before us, sealing the path ahead shut, we both practically skidded to a halt, falling back to the forest floor. The white smog formed a dense, misty wall in a circle around where we lay, leaving only the ground and sky free of its grasp. \n\n  It was over. \n\n  Whatever game it had been playing had reached its conclusion. The time had come for it to claim its prize. \n\n  There was nowhere to go; not unless the ranger who already saved me once, had a set of wings or a fast-acting shovel he hadn't informed me about. \n\n  \"I'm sorry, friend,\" he said, glancing back at me as we lifted ourselves from the ground, preparing to meet our shared fate. \n\n  As the flowing rapids within that ivory smoke continued to spiral around us, I felt my heart racing so quickly, I feared I may pass out any second. While the idea of not being conscious to experience whatever was to happen next did seem an almost welcome sensation, my mind and body were scattered to the four winds at that point. \n\n  \"It's not your fault, Tucker,\" I said, attempting to fend off the trembling in my voice, \"if it wasn't for you, I'd be dead already \"\n\n  The cylinder of dense fog began to shrink, closing in on us from every angle, stopping its approach only feet from where we stood. \n\n  \"You're not followin' me,\" Tuck said, slowly drifting his head all around. \n\n  It looked as though wispy feet were stepping from the fog, as though a ghostly army was hidden away within. More mist flooded upwards, forming some sort of spiderwebbed dome above us. As legs began to trail out, followed by almost translucent bodies, the smoke peeled away between each one, like cotton candy being separated. \n\n  \"That ain't what I'm sorry about…\"\n\n  As the arms reached from each misty torso; every one of them with elongated fingers, ready to snatch us up from where we stood, my companion moved so quickly, my mind hadn't a chance of understanding what was happening. \n\n  \"I'm sorry I can't go no further with you,\" he said, gripping my shoulders in his hands, \"just keep runnin', and don't look back…\" \n\n  Before I had a chance to protest, or otherwise argue against it, I felt my feet lifting from the dried leaves, as my body was launched through the gap ahead, tearing through the already torn strips of dense, stringy fog. \n\n  \"GO!\" I heard screaming out from the strange ball of wispy energy, as a light began to illuminate from within. \n\n  While I wanted to fight back; to free the one who had thrown me to freedom as effortlessly as if he were tossing a towel into the laundry hamper, I wouldn't even know where to start. While the ripples of smoke encased him, the high-pitched, shrill squeal that accompanied the vibrant glow damn near turned my hair white. \n\n  \"GO!!\" his now almost tortured voice shrieked once more, sounding as though he was experiencing a pain I could barely fathom. \n\n  Whether it was simply my desire to escape that inspired me to do as he commanded; to get off my ass and run even harder than I had before, or just that I knew there was nothing I could do to help him, I can't say, but I was ashamed of my actions nonetheless. \n\n  Not only had he saved my life twice by this point, but I had to believe he was sacrificing himself to save me. Given the tortured howl that wailed out from behind me as I sped onward in search of safety, I was certain this was the fate met by those other poor souls who encountered the Gray. \n\n  When the agonized scream bled into an explosion, sounding as though it fragmented those trees surrounding where the Ranger made his final stand, the shockwave tossed me back to the forest floor like a ragdoll. \n\n  As I lay there, feeling my consciousness slipping back into the black, I couldn't tell what sort of condition I was in. My mind slipping, I tried to push up from the dirt and dead leaves, but that concussion had drained every ounce of strength I had left. \n\n  Before my eyes closed, dropping me back into almost blissful darkness, I heard a familiar voice; one that was almost surprising enough to keep me from drifting away. \n\n  \"You're gonna be alright now. See you 'round, friend.\"\n\n  The hospital bed I awoke in felt heavenly after passing out in the woods, or so I thought anyway. When my mom came running up to my bedside, with Dale smiling down at me by her side, I was still out of it. Be it from whatever they fed into my veins to take the edge off the pounding in my head, or simply whatever damage lay beneath the gauze around my scalp and forehead, I had no clue. \n\n  We talked a little while we awaited the doctor, my mother trying to fight back the tears that streamed down her face, with my stepfather's arm wrapped around her midsection. Though what she told me didn't quite match up with my recollection of things; that it took the firefighters and paramedics some time to pull me free from the wrecked car, halfway swallowed up by the fissure in the road, I didn't fully register the implications at the time. \n\n  When my doctor arrived, stating that he was confident the surgery performed on my cracked skull had been a success, I still assumed the injury to have been caused by the shockwave, throwing me to the forest floor. The cast around my left leg, as well as the bandages around my left wrist and both hands, would take less time to heal than my fractured dome, but he felt certain I would make a full recovery in due time. \n\n  Over the months that followed my short stay in the hospital, I went through a good deal of work to retrain my broken body and mind, once I had healed enough to do so. Before long, I was cleared to return to work, having made a full recovery from my injuries, as the doctor had predicted. \n\n  The three-inch scar across my hairline isn't too noticeable, and neither are those across my wrist, but the marks on my hand from the mincemeat left in the wake of my windshield crashing down on it, stand out like a literal sore thumb. Still, some battle scars are a small price to pay, all things considered. \n\n  Once life returned to normal, I took a short trip one weekend, back to the woods I had crashed alongside. It took me a while to locate the Ranger station, but I had to find out if Maxwell Tucker was real or just a figment of my fractured mind. While I hoped this could provide some answers about what I truly experienced that day, I also wanted to be able to thank him for what he did for me. \n\n  When I pulled up beside the quite lovely log cabin that appeared to house the Rangers of this slice of the forest, a uniformed man and woman, leaning on one of the jeeps gave me a wave. While I thought about beginning with a little small talk, as I climbed out of my dad's old truck to approach the two wearing friendly smiles, I thought it best just to get right to the point. \n\n  \"Hi,\" I said, tipping the brim of my baseball cap, \"would you happen to know if Ranger Tucker is around?\" \n\n  \"Tucker?\" the tall, broad-shouldered guy asked, glancing at his associate. \n\n  The woman, who looked to be in her mid-thirties, or early forties, with her dark hair tied into a ponytail beneath her wide-brimmed hat, formed a strange sort of scowl as she blinked from her colleague to me. \n\n  \"Only Tucker we had around these parts ain't around anymore,\" she said, squinting her eyes as she studied me. \n\n  \"Oh. Maxwell Tucker? Is that him? Ranger Tuck?\" \n\n  \"Uh-huh,\" she said, giving me a very strange look, \"he used to work with us, some fifteen years back.\"\n\n  \"Oh, wow! I could've sworn he was around my age,\" I said with an awkward laugh, \"do you happen to know where he is now?\" \n\n  \"Same place he's been for a decade and a half, son,\" she said, gesturing to the left with a tilt of the head. \n\n  When I turned to see the small cemetery, up on the hill, I felt all of the blood drain from my face, my legs giving out beneath me. \n\n  \"Woah, now,\" the woman called out, she and her partner catching me before I hit the ground. \n\n  After they carried me inside, laying me on a lumpy, yet comfortable couch, the tall man fetched me some water, while one of the others laid a wet towel across my brow. After my heartbeat regulated, Ranger Angie Temple, who had helped me inside, accompanied me on a stroll up to the old boneyard. \n\n  We talked a good deal over the hours that followed. While I was hesitant to tell her about how I met Ranger Tucker, she told me a good deal about the man who consequently saved both of our lives. \n\n  She was still 'green around the gills' back then, with Tuck being her trainer. One day, some six months after she joined the Rangers, they responded to a call about an attack out in the woods; those that ran alongside the road that swallowed my car. \n\n  Assuming it to be a bear, or some other wildlife having jumped some innocent campers, they headed out to the scene, armed and prepared.\n\n  \"I felt like my damn heart was about to burst through my chest, but Tuck looked just as calm as if he was walkin' to the kitchen to fetch a snack,\" Angie said with a chuckle, running her hand across the tombstone bearing his name. \n\n  When they arrived to see a large, shaggy-haired man with a pistol trained on the crying teenage girl he held, and a butane torch in the hand wrapped around her, she was uncertain if this was something they could handle. The boy around her age laying on the ground, bleeding upon the leaves, looked like he was long gone, but all of this was enough for the fear to almost paralyze her where she stood. \n\n  Again, Tuck still wore that carefree smile as he tried to calm the situation, attempting to convince the disturbed man to release his hostage.  \n\n  \"For a second there, I thought he was gonna pull it off,\" Angie said, a tear leaking from her right eye, \"but when the big guy raised the gun, pointing it right at me, pushin' the girl he held to the ground, I knew I was done for.\" \n\n  She lowered her head, still caressing the gravestone like a dear friend. The sadness etched into her gaze almost inspired my own eyes to leak as hers did, but I tried to fight them back. \n\n  \"As soon as he raised that pistol to me, Tuck jumped right in front of me, knockin' me outta the way. How he knew he didn't have time to get a shot off before the gun on me discharged, I'll never know, but it all played out in seconds, right in front of me.\"\n\n  \"When the bullet dropped him to the ground beside me, I'd already fired off three rounds myself. At least one of the shots hit the canister the bastard held, blowin' it apart and lightin' him up like Joan of Arc in seconds. He still tried to fire off the shots he had left, while he screamed out from the well-deserved pain. I jumped towards the girl, to pull her away before she got caught up in the flames or the gunfire, but It was too late for Tuck. He was gone before he hit the grass.\" \n\n  We stood in silence for a moment, both of us staring down at the headstone. When she spoke again, I once more found myself lost for words; bewildered by everything she shared with me. \n\n  \"The man we took down that day turned out to be one foul son of a bitch. Seems he'd been killin' folks for years until Tuck and I put an end to him. If nothin' else, I take some solace in knowin' that Tuck was the last victim of Jeremiah Gray.\" \n\n  \"Gray?\" I said, almost more to myself. \n\n  \"Yup,\" she said, crouching down to wipe some dirt from the tombstone, \"won't see no grave for him, though. Don't know what they did with what was left of him after the fire died down, and don't give too much of a damn either. He took Tuck away from us, and he deserved that agonizing end. When the law arrived, all that was left was a crispy frame billowing plumes of thick, white smoke.\"\n\n  \"Accordin' to Stacy, the girl we saved that day, Gray had kidnapped her about a week before. He tortured her some, over that time, finally settin' her loose in those woods. He told her he'd let her go free if she got to safety, but if he caught up to her, he'd put her through hell.\"\n\n  \"The boy bleedin' on the grass was the one who called it in, havin' witnessed what was happenin' while he was takin' a hike. Poor kid didn't know what hit him when Gray got there before we did.\"\n\n  I never told her the full story about how I came to meet Maxwell Tucker, nor the implications of what or who we perhaps both faced between those trees. We talk a lot since I joined the Rangers soon after that meeting. We still talk about Tuck, as well. While I may never have had the opportunity to really get to know the man who saved me from a potentially grim fate that day, those who knew him in life have shared with me a great deal about him. \n\n  Over the years that followed the death of both Maxwell Tucker and Jeremiah Gray, there had apparently been some strange occurrences out in that forest. Someone would go missing from time to time, others would turn up dead. Now and then, though, one of those presumed dead would turn back up, confused about what happened. \n\n  Even after they closed that section of the woods to the public, it wasn't easy to keep those curious enough to enter from sneaking in. A forest isn't something easily blocked off completely, but they still did what they could. \n\n  While those who survived these strange occurrences had no recollection of how they made it out alive, I know how they reached safety, or who led them to it anyway. Whatever the case, ever since my encounter with the Gray, these unsettling events seem to have come to an end. \n\n  I like to think that Tuck finally finished that son of a bitch off for good, that day. While I want to believe that this may have allowed him to move on to whatever lies beyond this world, I have a feeling he's still out there watching out for us. \n\n  I spend a lot of time out in those woods. It's a strange sensation, how vibrant and alive everything appears on this side of the looking glass. Still, should I ever have an opportunity to thank Maxwell Tucker for what he did for me, my best chance would be out there. Plus, if he is still out there, it's only fair that I keep watch on this side, just in case our old friend returns. \n\n  I still miss my dad. I suppose I likely always will. That's the nature of loss, after all. Now that I feel like I've finally found my place in this world, I just wish I could tell him, you know? I wish I could let him know that his son is no longer lost in the woods, but found where he belongs within them. I doubt that either of us could've predicted that one.",

        "text": "I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not religious anymore. Not really. I spent too much of my life afraid of Hell and God and feeling guilty about every human flaw I possess. Not to mention all of the hypocrisy I saw from the people who were supposed to be moral authorities in the community. \n\nMy family was Pentecostal. For those who spent their life outside of the bible belt, it’s like a soft-core Christian cult. It’s not like Jonestown or anything and it’s an official denomination but the behaviors of the people in the church are very familiar to a lot of readings I’ve done about cults in the US. \n\nWomen and girls are required to keep their hair long, wear long denim skirts. We’re not allowed to wear make-up, jewelry, band t-shirts, or anything that could be considered “of the flesh” that would distract us or others from the presence of God. All that was required of boys was that they keep their hair neat and wear proper church clothes. \n\nThere were a lot of weird rules too that just didn’t belong in the 21st century. For one, men and women weren’t allowed to swim in the same pool together. Women had to tie their hair up if they were singing on the stage. Hannah Montana was a big no no at my church specifically for some reason. Our pastor was also very anti- TV. Most families threw theirs out to keep the evil of the world from infecting their households. \n\nWe once held a bonfire night where everyone brought items from their home that had the spirit of the flesh in them and we would toss them into the fire to cleanse ourselves. A woman I knew, Sister Sharon, took a few polaroid pictures that night and went around the following Sunday to show everyone the “demons'' she caught in the flames. \n\nI’m saying all this to essentially set the stage. Growing up in this environment as a kid, you don’t question any of it. If you did, an adult would be there with a scripture to steer you back on course. So none of the stuff I described above was ever weird to me. In fact, I was obsessed with gaining approval from Sunday school teachers and youth leaders. I’d beg my public school friends to come to church with me so that I could save their souls from fiery damnation. It wasn’t weird to me. It was just the way things were. \n\nI believe I was around 10 years old at the time. Maybe 11. So it would've been the summer of 2005. After a solid school year of A’s on my report card, my parents rewarded me with a trip to church camp. It was a week-long experience on a rural Pentecostal campground with kids from all over the surrounding counties. For a kid who never got to go anywhere without her parents, who was rarely ever invited to sleepovers, this week was a breath of freedom. I got to sleep in a bunk room with other girls, who would giggle and play secret games early into the morning. I got to wander around the campground, free to do any activity I wanted without any adults holding my hand. I had an allowance to buy snacks at the canteen, any snacks I could want. \n\nIt was a nice change to feel independent.\n\nAt orientation day, we were given a pamphlet listing all the activities scheduled for the week throughout the campground. Lots of classic camp games- tug of war, kickball, frisbee golf. There was also an arts &amp; craft room. That’s where I spent most of my time.\n\nDespite my confidence interacting with adults, I was very nervous to interact with other kids. I’m introverted by nature and to be surrounded by so many kids at once, wanting to make new friends and not knowing how, it was a lot on my nerves. \n\nThe crafts room was run by two teenage girls who were very nice. It was quiet and air conditioned. They would give daily projects, accompanied by a lesson on faith or whatever, but afterwards you were free to just hang out and create what you wanted. \n\nThat’s where I met Morgan.\n\nIt took me an hour to work up the courage to even say hello to her. She was my age, pretty, and had long strawberry blond hair tied up in a giant hello kitty scrunchy. She sat across from me, humming as she meticulously added patterns of glitter to a coloring sheet of the 12 apostles. We worked in a comfortable silence for the first portion of the session but after an hour of sneaking glances, I forced myself to speak. \n\nWe talked about anything relevant to two 10 year old girls at church camp. Our favorite bible characters, why we liked art, our favorite thing about *Jesus*. \n\nThe conversation eventually morphed into our favorite books, tv shows, music. Things we weren’t allowed to like that we liked anyway. She showed me some drawings she’d tucked away. They were fantasy creatures, mermaids mostly, but it was an unspoken understanding as to why she had to hide them. We talked until we had to vacate the room to go to lunch. It was so natural how we fell into being friends without ever actually saying the words. We were attached at the hip for the rest of the week and even convinced the girl she bunked with to swap with me. \n\nIt was Wednesday when she finally showed me the Box. She confessed that she’d been thinking about showing me something but wasn’t sure if she should. \n\nWe wandered off into a secluded section of the campground- an old walking trail that cut through a small patch of wood and over a large creek bed. I could tell that whatever she was going to show me, it was important. \n\nMorgan looked around, satisfied with the privacy, and from her little pink handbag she pulled out a small box. \n\nIt was the size of a cigarette carton, wrapped in blue craft paper. On the top were two blobs of golden glitter, which I could make out were supposed to be angels. I studied it a few moments before I asked.\n\n“What is it?”\n\nShe smiled, eyes knowing. \n\n“God lives in it.”\n\nI blinked. Confused. That didn’t sound right. I couldn’t help but object. I’d always been told God was all around us and that He was everywhere. Morgan shook her head, confident.\n\n“The Israelites carried him in a box. The ark of the covenant. We learned that in Sunday school.”\n\nI did remember hearing that. But how did she know He lived in this box?\n\nI asked.\n\n“He talks to me.” She admitted, giggling. Like she was happy to finally have someone to share this secret with. \n\n“What does He say?” I studied the little box in her hand, still hesitant. \n\n“That He loves me. He really, really loves us. And He answers questions, too. Watch.”\n\nShe flipped the box in her palm and thumbed a flap on its side, opening a small square piece on its lip. It was too dark to see anything inside, and before I could look, she pulled it to her mouth. She whispered something into the box, so quiet that even where I stood I couldn’t hear. She then pressed her ear to the opening. \n\nA long moment passed. \n\nThen she laughed. \n\n“He says your favorite color is purple.” \n\nA chill ran up my spine. My favorite color *was* purple. \n\nI must have looked as shocked as I felt because she started to giggle. After a moment, I started to laugh too. \n\nThe rest of that afternoon was spent asking God questions. \n\nMorgan was our proxy, obviously. I would think of questions to ask, she would whisper and listen, and together we would interpret what we were told. I can’t remember everything we asked (as it was 17 years ago) but here are some highlights:\n\n*How did the dinosaurs really die?*\n\n*What’s at the bottom of the ocean?*\n\n*Are aliens real?*\n\n*What’s your favorite animal?*\n\n*What was Jesus like as a kid?*\n\nObviously, the answers were either straight forward or vague as fuck. In hindsight, a lot of God’s favorite animals or colors aligned conveniently similar to Morgan’s favorites. But at the time, having a direct line to someone we’d only ever read about was exciting.\n\nWe stayed there, chatting and giggling until dusk, before heading back to attend evening service. We were still buzzing with energy in the pews and I couldn’t help but take out my Lisa Frank notepad to write down questions so I wouldn’t forget them. \n\nAfter lights out, we asked more questions. They were hushed, whispered, afraid to draw attention to us from the other girls in the cabin. Sure, it was a church camp but *we* were the only ones He talked to. We weren’t eager to share Him. \n\n“Can I ask Him something now?” I crossed my legs, leaning closer. \n\n“Sure!” Morgan smiled. “What else?”\n\n“No. I mean. I want to talk to Him.”\n\nMorgan hesitated, her shoulders going stiff and she glanced down to the little box. \n\n“Mmmm I dunno.” She said, clearly mulling it over.\n\n“Pleeease? Just one?” I begged. “You got to ask Him stuff all day.”\n\nA long moment passed and she picked up the box to once more whisper into it. Another long moment as she listened for a response. She nodded her head, solemn. \n\n“He said that it’s okay.” She confirmed, and reluctantly passed the box into my awaiting palm. \n\nA thrill shot through me. It was so different to hold it in my hand, knowing that He was inside. That he would answer me, *really* answer me. I tried to suppress my excitement. There was only one thing I wanted to ask. I pulled it close and whispered softly;\n\n*“Will I ever have a little brother or a little sister?”* \n\nI quickly pressed it against my ear, as if I was being timed.\n\nSeveral long moments passed. Silence.\n\nMy excitement flickered. Was I not good enough? Was it only Morgan who was worthy? \n\nThen I heard it- the sound of breathing. It was soft, hushed. Then the voice of a man whispered into my ear;\n\n***“Neither.”***\n\nMy heart dropped into my stomach. It wasn’t fear I felt. It was a dull, unpleasant surprise. Like walking up a set of stairs in the dark and you think there’s one more step than there actually is.\n\nI knew in my heart that He would answer me. But I expected it to be an inside voice, something I was familiar with while praying. An inner thought that felt like someone else. That’s what I was taught to listen for. \n\nBut His voice had come so clearly. I felt the heat of it tickle my ear and ghost down my neck. It hadn’t sounded heavenly or ethereal. It sounded like… a man. A stranger. The closest I can describe it was once a man I didn’t recognize called my house asking to talk to my dad about a truck he was selling. Even now, writing this, I break out into a full body chill remembering the sound of Him. \n\nI was too shocked at first to register His actual answer. A few seconds after gathering myself, I whispered another question, this one more probing.\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\nI was more hesitant to listen that time, slower to bring the box to my ear. More moments passed. Morgan watched, her face curious. \n\nThere again. Breathing. \n\n***“I love you. I love you.”*** He whispered.\n\nFor some reason, it made me sick to my stomach. But devoted as I was, I told Him I loved him, too. \n\n“I told you he loves us.” Morgan beamed as I handed the box back to her.\n\nI nodded and tried to smile in turn. I was much quieter after that, letting Morgan chatter and giggle away until the beam of a flashlight flooded the doorway. All of the girls scurried back to their bunks as a camp counselor rounded the corner, chastising us for staying up so late.  I was happy for the quiet. To think. \n\nI remember laying there wide awake, confused and queasy. I felt fear… and then guilt.  I had called on Him and then felt afraid. What kind of child of God would do that? He said He loved me and this was how I repaid him? I was horrible.\n\nI turned over in bed, suddenly all too aware of the number of craft paper angels fluttering in the beams above my head. \n\nThe next morning at breakfast, Morgan gave me her orange slices. I hadn’t done the best job hiding my distress and had hardly touched my food. \n\n“He said it’s okay.” She told me, her voice gentle. \n\nI said nothing but gave her my full attention.\n\n“He said that it’s okay to be afraid of Him.” She reassured me.\n\nIt caught me off guard and I felt a flood of relief course through me. Of course. Of course He would understand. Of course He would. I remember nodding my head and holding back tears. I remember Morgan pulling me into a hug, telling me once again that He loved me. \n\nI was less afraid after that but let Morgan carry the burden of listening to Him. \n\nEventually, camp came to an end. Morgan and I exchanged phone numbers. As it turned out, we only lived 25 minutes from one another- just separate school districts and churches. My parents were delighted to hear I’d made a new friend, a new *Christian* friend. I told them every detail of camp I could think of- every detail except for one. \n\nMorgan and I both knew trying to explain to our parents that God lived in our box would be a losing battle. We agreed that He would be our special secret. I would occasionally write down questions to read to Morgan over the phone. She would tell me His answers. \n\nBecause we spoke over the phone so frequently, my mom reached out to invite her and her parents to a church fish fry. It was also a way to vet her family, to see if future sleepovers would be appropriate. \n\nWe nearly knocked each other out when we collided into a hug in the gravel parking lot. It’d been over a month since camp and we couldn’t stop rambling excitedly. We left our parents to their introductions as we ran off to the swing sets. \n\n“Do you think they’ll let us do sleep overs?” I asked, watching our dads chat under the patio.\n\n“I don’t know.” Morgan hummed, spinning the swing in a leisurely circle. “But He might.”\n\n“You brought Him?”\n\nShe pulled the box from her skirt pocket.   \n“I bring Him everywhere.” She grinned, opening the lip. \n\nShe hesitated. Then held the box out to me. \n\n“You ask.” \n\nA rush of anxiety.\n\n“Why?” I stammered. \n\nShe looked thoughtful.\n\n“I think He wants to talk to you. He’s asked about you a lot.”\n\nI swallowed, my throat suddenly dry. I held my palm open, trying to calm my heart rate as Morgan passed the box to me. My hands felt cold as I leaned down to speak.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nI let a moment pass before pressing the box to my ear. \n\nUnlike before, no time passed before the familiar voice spoke.\n\nAs an adult now, I can't for the life of me recall everything that the voice whispered to me that day. But it was hurried, rushed, as if at any moment it would be snatched away from my hand and the message would be lost forever. I recently opened up my grandpa’s bible to do some skimming and came across something familiar to that memory.\n\nThe Verse itself is in Psalm. Psalm 139: 15.\n\n&gt;*My frame was not hidden from You*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*when I was made in secret,*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*when I was woven together*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*in the depths of the earth.*\n\nI believe He actually quoted the entire chapter to me, but with how fast He spoke and the fact that I was 10 years old, it’s hard to say for sure. I just remember being scared. Scared to interrupt, scared of how frenzied He spoke to me. I sat there, petrified, as He whispered frantically into my ear. It must have been several minutes and then He went quiet. \n\nMy heart pounded against my ribs. I let out a shaky breath and tried to remember that He was someone I could trust. Out of everyone, He was the only one I could have faith in.\n\n“I’m sorry... I don’t understand.” I confessed into the box. \n\nMorgan and I waited for several minutes. I heard Him breathing, steady and haunting, like the crashing of waves on a shore. Then…\n\n***“I love you. I love you.”*** \n\nOnce again, hearing that made me sick to my stomach. But once again, I told Him I loved Him, too. \n\nAfter that day, we were officially allowed to sleep over at one another’s houses. \n\nWe spoke to the box less and less as time went by. It made me uneasy to speak to Him and I suspected that it was taking a toll on Morgan as well. She still carried it with her, but as summer turned to autumn, our friendship became more and more founded on our shared interests. \n\nUsually the box sat on her night stand while I slept over and at my house it was nestled on my window sill. We confided in each other a lot, especially late into the night. Just talking about life with someone your age, about things that confused you… it’s a unique and nostalgic feeling. During these talks, we felt compelled to place the box under a pillow or blanket. It’s silly, thinking that it would make a difference. But it helped to feel some sense of privacy from the all knowing. \n\nBefore I even realized, two weeks had passed before either of us had even thought up a question to ask. \n\nThen my mom got pregnant. \n\nI remember her and dad sitting me down and telling me. They were so excited but all I felt was confusion. God’s answer echoed in my ears. How was she pregnant? God told me I wouldn’t have any siblings at all. I couldn’t help it. I felt like they needed to know. So I told them what He’d told me. \n\nThey didn’t believe me. In fact, they sat me in the living room for what felt like hours going through every part of the bible that contained a miracle pregnancy. They told me that anything was possible through God’s grace and love. We needed to have faith in Him. \n\nBut I did have faith in Him. And that’s what filled me with dread. \n\nI called Morgan that night. \n\n“Ask Him if my mom will have a boy baby or a girl baby?” I instructed, voice firm. \n\nA pause on the line. Whispering. A longer pause.\n\n“He… says neither.” Morgan answered, hesitant. \n\n*Just like before.* My heart beat thrummed in my ears. I cleared my throat.\n\n“Ask Him… if she’ll have a baby at all.” I whispered, fearful that I would be overheard.\n\nI could feel Morgan’s discomfort over the crackle of the call. I could tell she didn’t want to. But she was my friend. So she did.\n\n“...”\n\n“Morgan?”\n\nHer voice came through, choked. I knew she was crying. \n\n“He says… it’ll die. In her stomach. He says… they’ll name it after your grandpa… He…”\n\nA very, very long pause. \n\nI heard her let out a terrible, shaking breath.\n\n*“I don’t want to tell her that.”* She whispered, her voice far away from the receiver. \n\nA cold terror settled into my chest. I called her name, desperate to hear what God had told her. \n\n“I have to go.” She whimpered. \n\nA *click!* \n\nDial tone. \n\nI couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. All that I felt was a dark cloud, an impending doom. I was latched to my mother at all hours she was accessible to me. She enjoyed the attention, happy to brush my hair and watch Disney movies with me as she flipped through baby magazines. I didn’t let her out of my sight at home. I’d never hated going to school more in my life than during this time.\n\nI finally convinced Morgan to sleep over. We needed to talk and I didn’t want to leave my mom alone for a weekend. \n\nWe picked her up. It was a quiet car ride to my house.\n\nOnce in my room, I rounded on her.\n\n“Ask Him if my mom is going to die.” I cut to the quick of it. I couldn’t take even one more day not knowing if my mother was in danger. \n\nMorgan seemed to shrink into herself. She wouldn’t look at me.\n\n“I don’t want to.” She shook her head, eyes welling up with tears. “You ask Him.”\n\nDread washed over me. But I had to be brave. For my mom. I reached into Morgan’s purse and felt the familiar shape of it. I opened the lip of the box. It took several minutes to build up the courage to form the words. \n\n“Please… tell me my mom won’t die. Please.” I whimpered, hands trembling as I held the box close. I was shaking all over, my entire body wracked with nerves. At that moment, I would’ve rather someone pressed my face to a stove burner than bring that box to my ear. \n\nExcruciating silence.\n\nThen…\n\n***“Everything dies.”***\n\nA sob escaped me. The room began to spin. Morgan started crying. I don’t remember sitting down but I ended up on the floor, shaking and sobbing into my arm. Desperate, I brought the box to my mouth once more.\n\n“Why? Why why why why?!” I wept, snot dribbling down my nose. I scrunched my eyes shut and listened for the answer.\n\nI heard Him breathing. Calm. Empty. \n\n***“I love you. I love you. There is no fear in love. I love you.”***\n\n“No you don’t. *You don’t!”* I shrieked and Morgan started weeping, her face buried in her hands as she shook her head. Through the other side of the door I heard my mother’s voice, her footsteps. The door knob was already turning when I had enough sense to toss the box under my bed. There was no hiding our grief. We both rushed to be held, totally incoherent when asked what in the world had happened. \n\nWe never told her. We made up a story. That we’d gotten into a fight. I’m not sure she believed us. But she helped us clean up, comforting us both as she wiped our faces with a wet cloth. We all curled up on the couch together, putting a movie on. She petted my hair. I didn’t let go of her until I fell asleep. \n\nThe next morning, Morgan wanted to go home. I crawled under my bed to give her the box back but she shook her head. She didn’t want it. Back then, I was so angry with her. For showing me the box in the first place, for everything it told us, for leaving it with me. But I know now she was a scared little girl just like I was. \n\nI didn’t know what to do with it. \n\nI held it in my hands, studying it for an hour and thinking about how I was supposed to get rid of it. I didn’t want to destroy it. That felt… wrong. Blasphemous. \n\nI read my bible. The Israelites treated the Ark of the Covenant with great reverence. It was the throne of God, the place his spirit would descend to the earth and speak with his chosen people. It was only ever to be touched by those who were clean. Those who were unclean would die simply touching or looking at it. Even entering the tent it was housed in accidentally was enough to earn his wrath and the offender would fall over dead. \n\nI sat up late into the night and wondered if he would ever do such a thing to me, too. \n\nAfter days of searching for an answer, I finally settled on placing it in an old shoebox at the top of my closet. Out of sight. Out of mind. \n\nThe further my mother grew along in her pregnancy, the worse I felt. She sensed it. Even though she didn’t know what was troubling me, she did her best to comfort me. \n\n“I just love you so much.” I told her one night when she placed my hand over her stomach. “I don't want you to die…”\n\nShe held me close. \n\n“I will someday.” She confessed. “But everyone does someday. Mama will be alright until then.”\n\nDespite her efforts, the words did not comfort me. I simply held onto her for as long as I could. \n\nShe was 4 months along when she miscarried. I don’t remember much from the several days we spent in the hospital. It was a lot of waiting. A lot of doctors taking my dad aside to talk to him. Both sets of my grandparents were there. Aunts, uncles, pastors, church members, Morgan’s parents- a revolving door of prayer warriors, everyone telling me that everything was going to be alright. Praying. \n\nBut I knew the truth before anyone told me. \n\nI didn’t cry at my mother’s funeral. It sounds strange but I wanted to be strong for my dad. He’d lost his wife and unborn son within the span of one horrible week and he was struggling the hardest. I held his calloused hand in my own as he quaked. I knew he was trying to be strong for me, too. \n\nI saved all my crying for that night, alone in my room. I cried and cried and cried. To this day I don't think anything else has ever compared to that pain. After all the crying, I was too tired to sleep. I could only lay there, a hollow feeling in my chest. \n\nA few hours like that, I couldn't help it. I needed to know why. I had to know *why* *my mom*?  I pulled the shoebox from the top of the closet. The gold of the angels’ faces shimmered under the moonlight as I held the box in my hands. I sighed, exhausted. \n\n“Why did you take her?” I whispered. “Why did it have to be her? I need her. I want my mom back.” \n\nNothing. At first.\n\nThen…\n\n***“Wretched, beautiful, imperfect creature…”*** He spoke, voice even and hollow. **“*****Suffering is your birthright*****.”**\n\nI was too tired to be afraid then. But now. Thinking about it. I feel the fear anew.\n\n“I don’t understand.” I said, my head resting against the closet door-frame. \n\nBreathing against my ear, the hair on the nape of my neck flickered like spider legs against my skin. \n\n***“You never will.”*** He said. \n\nWe sat together for a moment. \n\n“Can I say something to my mom?” I tried,  “Please?”\n\n…\n\n***“Speak.”***\n\nI held it close, like a baby bird, and whispered. \n\n“I love you, mommy. I miss you.” \n\nI wanted to hear her voice. I wanted so badly to know that she was somewhere better. That she knew I loved her. \n\nI was met with only silence. \n\nSilence and the soft breathing in my ear. \n\nA few days later, when my dad was outside mowing the lawn, I pulled down the attic stairs in the hallway. I had always been too afraid to go up there myself. But I needed to feel alone. And I couldn’t so long as I could reach the box. I crawled up into the warm air of the attic, careful to mind the support beams and the insulation. Eventually, I found what I was looking for. \n\nA divot in the fluffy, aged pink insulation. Using the yard stick I’d brought from the kitchen, I flipped over a panel of plywood. My dad had used it before to access some wiring in the walls. I stared at the dark, empty space, yawning like a great beast before me. \n\nI pulled out the box. Even knowing what I needed to do, it was so small in my hand. I felt… guilt. For the last time, I brought it to my mouth. \n\n“I’m sorry… I love you.” \n\nI didn’t listen for an answer. Instead, I dropped it into the darkness below. \n\nI’m in a weird place mentally after writing all of this. It’s an experience I can’t forget but I’m mostly at peace with it. Like I said, I don't practice religion anymore. Any religion.\n\nMy family worries about me and my soul and yada yada. But at 27 years old, I’m okay. Gotta say the hardest part about telling this story to anyone is seeing how it lands. Everyone I've told has had a different interpretation of what the voice in the box was, whether or not I imagined it. Whether or not I made up the whole thing for clout. \n\nA lot of my college friends think it was a demon. My therapist almost convinced me that it was an imagined coping mechanism. My step sister suggested a fae creature of some kind. \n\nThose are comforting thoughts. \n\nI think He was exactly who Morgan introduced me to in that creek bed 17 years ago. I don't know how or why He chose to speak with two little girls. I don’t know what He wanted me to learn from any of it.\n\nMaybe learning wasn't the point. Maybe there was never any lesson to learn at all. \n\nI don't know. \n\nAnd I never will.\n\nBut I’m okay with that.",

        "text": "I didn't know where else to put something like this, and it probably will be a little short because there isn't all that much to it, but I wanted to know if anyone else has a dream like this. When I read the story about the blackout of 2014, something clicked and it feels like my nightmares may be connected to it and the memory loss around it.  \nEvery couple of months, I'll have this nightmare where all the power goes out and everyone, as they would, go outside to check with neighbours whether it's a household issue or something more. Everyone else is having the same issue. My parents are the ones who go outside, and my brothers and I hear some loud ordeal out on the streets - helicopters, banging, people screaming. When my parents come back inside, they tell us to go around the house and close all of the curtains as quickly and subtly as possible. I ask them what's happening and they say that there are black helicopters flying overhead and shooting people at random - some helicopters have one rotor, others have two, and we have a certain feeling that it's a military situation. We do as we're told, closing all of the curtains around the house and trying not to leave any gaps anywhere that we could be spotted through. As I get upstairs, I see a helicopter getting dangerously low and close, and it slowly turns towards our house. I don't know what to do until I see flashes of light coming from it, and at that point, I duck out of view, hoping that whoever it is thinks that they hit me. Weirdly enough, I don't actually remember any broken glass in the dream, but for some reason, that's part of what makes it feel so real and vivid.  \nAnyway, I hear the helicopter moving closer, and then further away, like it flew over the house and away from us. I stay below the window sill and drag the curtains closed. Even though the curtains in most of the house are somewhat thin and it's daytime, the whole house feels dark and claustrophobic. As the day drags on and the evening starts to draw in, we hear progressively less noise outside. We've shut my three cats in the living room where they won't be able to get behind the blinds, and we all sit quietly in the living room. I'm having a full-blown panic attack by this point, two of my brothers are crying (which is very unusual), and my dad is sitting with his air rifle next to his leg leaning against the sofa.  \nThis goes on for days, maybe even weeks, but I never get to a point in the nightmare where it's safe to go near the windows, but a couple of times, I do sneak a peak, not a hair more in view than it needs to be. There are helicopters EVERYWHERE, and some of them have bright red lights on them, which I presume helps them to find people better, though I haven't figured out exactly *why* they're hunting down civilians in the first place. The red lights snap towards any movement, so I never look for long. There are fires, downed power lines, crashed cars, and bodies littering the streets outside. The exact placement and tiny details are always the same.  \nThe scariest part of all of this - I feel like it isn't just a dream. It sounds crazy and delusional, and maybe it is, but I feel like this has happened before, and it's going to happen again. The only thing that I can say is that next time is going to be different, something is going to change. Please, if this really has happened, and any of you remember it or have dreamt about it, say something. I need to know.",

        "text": "Well, we’re stuck on the other side again. This isn’t a super unusual occurrence, but it’s always the most annoying way to spend our day. Luckily, we get paid overtime for these occasions, but it still takes way too much time and effort to get back to our reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told you about the first breach in open hours I experienced in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/), so since I find myself here again, I’ll tell you about the very first time I got stuck on the other side. It wasn’t too long after my first breach, maybe two weeks, so I was still relatively new to all of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I showed up for my shift that day, I already felt something was off. The staircase light was flickering a bit, which doesn’t seem unusual, but the slight flashing made my head spin more than it should. I was already on high alert, and stepping into the back office, I saw Daniel and Patrick whispering to each other. They quickly stopped when they noticed me, and Daniel offered me his fakest smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Good morning!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What’s going on? Something feels off today.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sighed and glanced at Patrick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, she obviously knows,” Patrick said, nodding to me. “You might as well just tell her.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Tell me what?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel stood up and motioned for me to take his seat. “Every now and then, the store has to sort of… *reset itself.* It’s not easy for this building to be constantly guarding itself and us, so sometimes it needs to recharge in its natural environment. It seems like today is going to be one of those days.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI glanced at Patrick, who shrugged, pulled out his phone, and shoved in his earbuds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So what does that mean exactly?” I asked Daniel, who looked annoyed with Patrick. “What is its ‘natural environment’?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It means today we will be in its reality while it cools down. It really isn’t too bad, and we won’t have to deal with any clients. In our reality, we will just look like an empty store. I don’t know how it works exactly, but in the 5 years I’ve been here, none of our clients, custom or otherwise, have ever mentioned us being gone during this time. I suppose the building puts up blinders of some sort, but who knows. Either way, today we will be cleaning the store, and when the time comes, we will guide the building back.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he walked away. I, as usual, had a million questions. How exactly does the building guard us? How does no one notice our business is missing? Won’t our appointments be wondering where we are? Also, what the fuck is the building’s reality?? But, as usual, I decided I didn’t want to ask too many questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed Daniel to the floor with our cleaning bucket and broom just as my other coworker, Samuel, arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven’t spoken about Samuel yet, so I feel like I should explain why. Samuel is… interesting, to say the least. He is seven feet tall (yes, I actually measured him one day), extremely well built, and has purple eyes. Daniel and Patrick assure me he is human, but I think they’re lying to me. Not necessarily because of his eyes, since I know there is a genetic mutation that gives people purple eyes, but because he really doesn’t show a whole lot of emotions, and for the entire year I’ve been here, the only thing I know about him is that he loves tea. That’s it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite his lack of personal connections, he is the best salesman I have ever met. He outsells everyone in our store combined during open hours, and during customs, he can calm the rowdiest of clients, while still upselling them to more expensive fabrics. He once convinced a faerie to *give me my name back*. This was during one of my first custom fittings when I wasn’t super aware of how most of these creatures work, but to this day, it is still the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m convinced he is the only reason this store is still in business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe’s the kind of guy that never loses his cool. So when he walked in on this day and instantly panicked, I knew this wasn’t going to be as simple as Daniel had made it seem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sam, it’s alright. You know how this works, we'll spend the day cleaning and be out of here before you know it. If you want, you can even organize the fabrics in the back so you don’t have to be by the windows,” Daniel said, immediately noticing Samuel’s anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Today of all days? Really? I’m leaving.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sam, we’re already open, you know you can’t-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore Daniel could stop him, Sam opened up the staircase door, revealing what I can only describe as a sea of souls. The thick, indigo liquid stretched out as far as I could see, and I swear instead of a splashing sound, the waves screamed. The sky in this world was deep red, and although brightly lit, I couldn’t find a light source. It seemed like the light was coming from the water. I suddenly felt the entire building shift, and realized we were floating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt myself getting nauseous, both from the motion and what I had just seen, and ran to the bathroom before I made another mess for us to clean up. Thankfully, the water in the toilet and sink was still regular, clear water. I sat on the bathroom floor and pulled out my phone to calm myself, and I noticed we still had a wifi connection. I considered asking how this was possible, but I decided I didn’t want to know. It was clear that none of this was ever going to make sense to me, so I washed myself up and went back to the floor to find Daniel and Patrick mopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You good?” Patrick asked, not even looking up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, sorry, just motion sickness,” I lied, but judging by his smirk, he knew better. “Where’s Sam?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“In the back. He hates when this happens. It’s really not so bad, plus we get overtime, *right Daniel*?” he said pointedly, and Daniel rolled his eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, yeah, you’ll get your overtime. Why don’t you start dusting down the mannequins, Harper? We’ll take care of the floor.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went and grabbed  the duster, but before I went back out to start on the mannequins, I realized something: Sam wasn’t there. I quickly checked the office, breakroom, and bathroom, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sam’s gone,” I announced, starting to feel a panic rising in my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He’s probably in the bathroom,” Patrick said, clearly unaffected by this news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He’s not, I checked. And he isn’t in the office or breakroom. What if he left? Do we have to go out there and look for him?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick laughed a bit at this, and Daniel shot him a look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m sure he’s around here somewhere, Harper,” Daniel tried to reassure me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Okay but where?? This store is tiny, and if he isn’t in the back or on the floor-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He said it’s fine. Don’t worry about it. Just start dusting, alright?” Patrick snapped, earning another harsh look from Daniel. He mumbled an apology to me, but it didn’t matter. It was clear this was yet another thing I didn’t need to know, so I moved on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about three hours of cleaning, the entire place was sparkling. We were all sitting on the couch chatting, when I heard a rattling in the ceiling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What was that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick and Daniel glanced at each other before Daniel said, “Probably just the building. It goes through a lot during this shift, but don’t worry. She’ll hold.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that, he stood up and started explaining closing procedures for days like this. Basically, how to get back to our reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We have to check that all the windows and doors are secured, the curtains are drawn, and there are no leaks anywhere on the floor. If you find a leak, tell me immediately, as I will need to contact corporate for further instructions. We’ll each have to sit alone in the middle of the room, silently, for five minutes. If you hear any voices during this time, whether you recognize them or not, let me know and I will contact corporate. *Please tell me if you hear voices*. They might try to convince you not to tell me, or will even impersonate me, but I promise you I will not be talking.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis statement didn’t really surprise me, as I deal with weird shit everyday, but the voices impersonating Daniel was shocking. We have plenty of custom clients who visit in the form of someone we know, trying to confuse us or just generally mess with us, but never as Daniel. Up until then I always assumed, as the manager, he was sort of untouchable to these other worldly beings, but I guess in this other dimension, no one is off limits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe began our check of the building, and as I was about to open the curtains to check the windows, Patrick stopped me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, let me do that.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’re not going to like what you see.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You don’t have to protect me, Patrick, I’m a big girl,” I said mockingly, before turning and opening the curtains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was greeted with an underwater view of the sea of souls. I could see hundreds of thousands of faces, screaming. They noticed me quickly and began swimming towards the window, banging viciously and screaming for help. Before Patrick could shut the curtains, I saw the face of the man Richard had eaten during my first breach of open hours. His face was stretched to a length unimaginable, and it could be in my mind, but I swear he recognized me for a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t even realize I was screaming until Patrick hugged me. I instantly started sobbing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m so sorry, I should have listened, I didn’t know-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s okay, you’re okay,” he said softly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe led me to the back office and sat me down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Look. This is just another day on the job. There is nothing you could have done to save those people. This is the way it works, and the only thing we can do is try to keep as many people out of this place as possible. You are very good at your job, okay? Don’t let this break you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the kindest thing Patrick had ever said to me, and it seemed like he realized it too, as he quickly got up and walked away. I was still shaking, but I heard a sound from the air vent above me. I looked up, and I swear, for a split second, I saw purple eyes staring back at me. As soon as I noticed them, they quickly disappeared, and I heard the same rattling I had heard earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t have time to process this before Daniel poked his head into the office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You okay?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded silently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s time for your five minutes. Let’s get this done so we can go home.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up and followed him out to the floor. He had drawn a circle with salt in the middle of the room, and motioned for me to sit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Remember, if you hear any voices at all, you need to tell me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat there for my five minutes, heart racing, but thankfully that was the only sound I heard. When Daniel touched my back, I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Time’s up! Hear anything?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe looked at me suspiciously for a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Do you really think I wouldn’t have screamed if I heard someone talking to me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Fair enough,” he said, and helped me back to my feet. “Sam, you’re up.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam came silently strolling out, glancing at me briefly before sitting in the circle. Daniel and I walked to the back and waited with Patrick silently in the office. When the timer went off, all three of us came back to the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Did you hear anything?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam shook his head, and Daniel didn’t ask any further questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Okay, we’re ready to go.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait, what do we do now?” I asked, seeming to be the only one confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We go home,” Sam said, already heading to the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wait don’t-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped as he opened the door. Our regular staircase was back. There was no sign of the sea of souls, or even any trace that it had been there. I had the urge to open the curtains to make sure it was safe, but after a reassuring nod from Daniel, I hesitantly followed Sam down the stairs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve never been so happy to see sunlight. I couldn’t believe we were actually back, and judging by the people walking past, they had no idea our building was just gone. I said my goodbyes to the guys, and got on the bus home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve experienced 3 more trips to the other side in my year working here. Each time has been the same, except for today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I heard voices during my five minutes. Lots of voices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t know how long we’ll be stuck here, but I’ll give you an update when I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)",

        "text": "I never really used to experience headaches. Sure, I had the occasional momentary stress headache, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. But one day this pain started to build behind my eyes, and since then I get these incredibly painful headaches. They're so intense that I can barely function. But it's not just the pain that's the problem. Whenever I get one of these headaches, I start seeing these figures. At first, I thought they were just hallucinations. I mean, who wouldn't think that, right?\n\nFor months I’ve been having those headaches, seeing the figures. I tried everything to get rid of them - taking painkillers, getting more sleep, eventually even going to the doctor - but nothing seemed to work. Then one day, something happened.\n\nI was walking down the street, feeling that pressure behind the eyes, trying to make it home before another headache hit me. It was only a matter of time before I was seeing the figures again. Unfortunately, this time was different. As I turned a corner, I bumped into one of them.\n\nUntil that moment, the figures had just been standing there, motionless. Previously I’d avoided them. Couldn’t really tell you why, but I always walked around them. The moment I made contact, every single one of them started staring at me. I tried to ignore them, hoping it was yet another hallucination. But then the headaches got worse. And with each headache, I started seeing more and more of the figures. It got harder and harder to ignore them.\n\nAnd then I happened to look one in the eye. I didn't do it on purpose or anything, my eyes just happened to stop there. I shouldn't have done that. All of the figures started sprinting towards me. I didn't know what to do. I was frozen in fear. I realized that I had to run. So I did.\n\nI don't know for how long I’ve been running, but it felt like hours. I don’t even know how I managed to run so long. The figures were always behind me, chasing me. I never looked back, but I could hear their feet pounding on the pavement and on the streets. I don’t know where I went, I just knew that I had to get away from them.\n\nFinally, I stumbled upon an old abandoned building. I didn't hesitate, I just ran inside and slammed the door shut behind me. I’m safe. For now. But I know that the figures are still out there, waiting for me. Eventually, they will find me.\n\nI don’t know what will happen if they do find me. I’m not willing to take the chance.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've been stuck in this abandoned building for hours now, hiding from the figures. But they're not leaving, they’re waiting for me. I can't take it anymore. I need help. I can hear them outside. I think they’re trying to open the windows. Please, someone, anyone, help me.",

        "text": "When people think of their first pet, they talk about dogs or cats. For me, however, it was a cow.\n\nNow, Lina wasn’t my cow, of course. She was one of many my grandpa owned.\n\nYears ago, when I was a young boy, I spent the long weeks of summer vacation at his farm.\n\nI  grew up a city boy, spending most of my young live in a concrete jungle  comprising nothing but rows and rows of old apartment buildings.\n\nWhen  grandpa suggested that I’d spent summer at his farm, I pestered my  parents about it for weeks. Eventually they relented and so I was off to  stay with grandpa.\n\nUntil then, I’d only been at grandpa’s home a few times, but I’d fallen in love with it the first time I’d been there.\n\nI loved the remote farm he called his home, the wide empty plains and the sprawling forests surrounding them.\n\nWhat  I loved the most, though, were the many farm animals he owned. Even in  his old age, grandpa was still a strong and sturdy man who continued to  work his farm.\n\n“Well, it’s the only thing I know how to do,” he always said laughing.\n\nWhile grandpa owned pigs and chickens, I was more taken by his cows.\n\nWhile the pigs in their pigsty ignored me, the chickens gave into a state of panic the moment I entered the coop to pet them.\n\nThe  cows, however, were friendlier, much friendlier. When I walked up the  pasture on my first day, they eyed me curiously before they walked up to  me.\n\nThe friendliest of them was  the one I named Lina. She was as black and white as the rest of them,  but had a white crescent mark on her forehead.\n\nNow,  I didn’t get to enter the pasture, of course, but even with a fence  between us, I could pet her head and feed her freshly mowed grass.\n\nI spent long hours outside, in the grass, watching the cows go about their day and petting and feeding them, above all, Lina.\n\nDuring  the time I spent with grandpa, I learned quite a bit about cows and  animal husbandry. Grandpa’s herd comprised dairy cows. Lina and the rest  were kept for milk production.\n\nI also learned that cows only gave milk when they were pregnant or with calf.\n\nEven  now I remembered how excited I was when I heard grandpa talk about  calves. I pestered him constantly, but he told me that the time of birth  varied. If I was lucky, though, I might see some of the newborn calves.\n\nWhen  I asked grandpa how all the cows got pregnant and where the father was,  he explained to me what artificial insemination was. Well, he didn’t go  into detail, instead he told me that sometimes, Mother Nature needed a  bit of help and that it was the easiest and safest option.\n\nBeing  the child I was, I thought little about it. No, all I cared about were  the calves. There were of course some younger cows in grandpa’s herd,  but they’d all been born in the spring. What I wanted to see was a  newborn one, a tiny one.\n\nAs luck wanted it, I should get my chance soon enough.\n\nI’d  been with grandpa for a week when he told me that a cow had just given  birth. The moment I heard a calf had been born, I was out of it and  raced to the barn as fast as my little legs could carry me.\n\nMy  young eyes grew wide the moment I saw the tiny body next to the  exhausted mother cow. Even more so when the calf got to its shaky feet.\n\n“It’s so small,” I brought out when grandpa caught up with me.\n\nThis baby cow, this calf, was the cutest thing I’d ever seen.\n\nWhen  I was about to step up to pet it, grandpa told me it was still too  early. Everything was new for the little one, and for now it needed to  get used to its environment.\n\nI was on pins and needles all day, pestering grandpa about wanting to play with the little calf.\n\n“Tomorrow, Mark, you can pet it tomorrow,” he eventually said.\n\nNeedless  to say, I was disappointed, even a little mad. I remember sitting near  the barn for hours, watching grandpa as he made sure that mother and  calf were doing all right.\n\nThe  next day, right after breakfast, when grandpa did another check-up, I  finally got my chance of scratching the calf behind its ears. I loved  the little guy and continued to visit him day in and out until he joined  the rest of the herd out in the pasture.\n\nI’d  done my best to bond with the little guy, but he was too shy and scared  to approach me on his own. In the end, Lina stayed my favorite.\n\nYet, one day, things changed at grandpa’s farm. One morning, right after breakfast, I could tell that something was different.\n\nI  rushed outside to greet Lina and the rest of the herd, but the cows  were acting different. They huddled together at the far end of the  pasture, their bodies pressed against one another. However much I called  out to them, however much I waved a tuft of fresh grass, they didn’t  come.\n\nI raced back to grandpa.\n\n“Grandpa, there’s something wrong with the cows, they are sick! They aren’t coming to me, not even Lina!”\n\nWhen he saw the visible fear on my face, he laughed.\n\n“Calm down, Mark. That’s just the way they are. They are beasts after all and sometimes, they just don’t care.”\n\nI  nodded, but I didn’t understand. For the rest of the day and the  following one I tried again and again, but the cows never came. Their  state of fear persisted.\n\nAfter  days, whatever had gotten into them passed, and they slowly reverted to  their normal behavior. Yet, I noticed, some still strayed from the rest.\n\nMy fears, however, were forgotten the moment Lina came up to me again and happily let me pet her.\n\nOver  the course of the next two weeks, more calves were born, and I was  always there when they first got to their feet. It was always a special  event for me.\n\nOne day, when I  heard that yet another one of grandpa’s cows was to give birth, I was  quick to hurry to the barn, only to be met with Stefan, grandpa’s single  farmhand.\n\nI’d seen him around  before, but he was a harsh, bitter man and I’d always avoided him. Now  he stood right in front of me, staring down at me with cold eyes.\n\n“Nothing to see here today, boy,” he said as he blocked my path.\n\n“But, I want to see the baby cow,” I protested and was about to push myself past him.\n\nIn one swift motion, he got a hold of my arm and glared at me.\n\n“There’s none today. Now go back to where you came from,” he pressed out and pushed me back the way I came from.\n\n“No,  but,” I tried to protest, but when he stepped up to me again, the  corners of his mouth twitching in anger, I eventually left.\n\nI  sat down in the grass near the meadow, mulling over how unfair it all  was. It was stupid I didn’t get to see the calf, and Stefan was even  more stupid and so was grandpa!\n\nAfter a while, as I sat there in the grass, I noticed smoke coming from the back of the farm.\n\nFor  a moment I wondered what was going on before my childish mind realized  that the farm must’ve caught on fire. As quickly as I could, I ran to  where the smoke was coming from.\n\nBehind the farm, I found grandpa and Stefan in front of a fire. They were burning something.\n\nAt  first I was relieved, glad it wasn’t the farm that was burning. Then,  when I got closer, my eyes glued to the fire, I saw something move  between the burning logs.\n\nAt first  I didn’t know what it was, but when I got closer, I saw limbs, legs, a  bunch of tiny legs that were sticking out from the fire.\n\nWhen I saw them twitch once more, I rushed for the fire, past grandpa, to pull what I thought was a calf from the burning pit.\n\nThe moment grandpa saw me, he got a hold of me and dragged me away from the fire.\n\n“Mark, what’s the matter with you, get away from there! This is nothing for a little boy like you, it’s dangerous!”\n\nAs  he dragged me away, my eyes were glued to the fire and the thing  burning within it. From afar it had looked like a calf, but the moment I  got closer I saw it was something else. The proportions had been all  wrong, weird and elongated. There were legs, but far too many of them. I  shivered as grandpa dragged me away.\n\nHe sat me down on a bench in front of the farmhouse. After a heavy sigh, he explained.\n\n“Sometimes,  there are... complications. Sometimes a calf can come out all wrong.  It’s nature, and sometimes, nature doesn’t get things right and parts  end up in the wrong place.”\n\n“But, why? Why was it all wrong, grandpa?”\n\nHe gave me a shrug.\n\n“That’s just how things are, nothing to be done about it.”\n\nI gave him a slow nod, but I still felt for the thing they’d burned. For days, the strange, misshapen calf stayed on my mind.\n\nIt  did even more so when Stefan joined us for breakfast one morning,  whispering something into grandpa’s ear. The bright smile he usually  wore vanished.\n\n“Stay here, Mark, all right?” he said to me while I was munching on my sandwich.\n\nI opened my mouth to ask something, but grandpa and Stefan had already left the room.\n\nWhen  I was about to put on my shoes and follow them, grandpa yelled at me to  stay inside. It was the first time I’d ever seen him like this, and the  first time he’d ever been angry with me.\n\nThe shoes dropped from my hand and with tears in my eyes I sulked back to the living room.\n\nI never learned what happened that day. Grandpa never told me a thing, and Stefan continued to glare at me like he usually did.\n\nIt was only one day, by sheer accident, that I caught bits of a conversation between the two of them.\n\n“So, how many this time?” I heard grandpa ask.\n\n“At least four of them,” Stefan pressed out in a strained voice.\n\nFor a while there was nothing but silence, and all I could hear was the quiet summer breeze rustling through the nearby trees.\n\nEventually grandpa sighed. “Guess it’s grown angry,” he finally said.\n\nStefan started cursing and mumbling indistinguishable.\n\n“Well, nothing we can do about it. Just have to take care of them like we always do,” grandpa brought out.\n\nA moment later I heard his steps coming into my direction and I hurried away. Yet, his words stayed on my mind.\n\n‘Guess it’s grown angry.’\n\nFor days I racked my brain, trying to understand what he was talking about.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t, I was a little boy, but one night should change everything.\n\nThat  night I’d been lying in bed for long hours, still racking my brain over  the strange things going on at the farm. When I fell asleep, strange  dreams plagued me. I saw the weird calf-thing in the fire again, saw it  move, heard it cry out for me.\n\nI  awoke, scared and confused, before I realized it had all been a dream.  At first, I lay in bed, but then I realized I had to go to the toilet.\n\nI  hated going to the toilet at grandpa’s during the night. The farmhouse  was old and at night you could hear any and all sounds around the farm.  For a child, even the shaking of the trees and the sound of the wind  were transformed into shapeless ghosts and invisible terrors.\n\nI raced to the toilet and as I sat there, the window cracked behind me, I heard something from outside.\n\nAs  I strained my ears, I could hear the mooing of the cows outside. It  didn’t sound like anything I’d heard before. They sounded afraid,  terrified, as if chaos had descended upon the pasture.\n\nI  tried to pry open the bathroom window, but wasn’t able to. So instead, I  tiptoed through the house and made my way to the living room. I pushed  my face against the glass of the window, but I couldn’t make out a  thing. All I saw was frantic movement in the pasture.\n\nEventually,  my hand wandered to the handle. As slowly and quietly as I could, I  pulled and opened the window. I leaned forward as far as I could,  pushing my upper body outside.\n\nAt  first, I could only see the cows racing from one end of the pasture to  the other, but then I noticed something else. There was something in the  pasture with them.\n\nFor a moment I  thought it was one of the cows, one that hadn’t joined the frantic,  crazed movements, but then I saw how big it was.\n\nIt was a towering, hulking shadow, much larger than any cow I’d ever seen before.\n\nI leaned forward further, almost dropping out the window.\n\nThen,  the moon pushed past the clouds and its light descended upon the  pasture. I saw a multitude of legs, saw a black and white hide, saw a  pair of horns. The creature threw its head back, releasing a grunt, a  loud distorted version of a moo before it charged after the cows.\n\nThe herd was in sheer and utter panic, dividing and forming up again as they fled from whatever this monstrosity was.\n\nSuddenly, one cow rushed off in the wrong direction, charging towards the farm while the rest fled further down the pasture.\n\nAnother  loud grunt followed, and the monstrosity threw itself at the lonely  cow. And just then, as the cow crashed against the fence of the pasture,  I noticed the white crescent mark on her forehead.\n\n“No,” I brought out in a shaken voice as I saw how the creature got a hold of Lina.\n\nI watched in horror as the abomination pushed itself on top of her.\n\nI opened my mouth, wanted to scream, to call out, to chase the demon away, but just then a hand was pushed over my mouth.\n\n“Don’t you dare,” I heard grandpa’s voice whisper into my ear.\n\nHe dragged me back, away from the window. Then he closed it off with his other hand before he pushed me from the room.\n\n“We have to help Lina!” I blurted out the moment he removed his hand. “Grandpa, come on, we have to!”\n\nWith that I was about to rush to the front door, but I’d only made it two steps before he got a hold of me.\n\n“Nothing we can do, Mark.”\n\n“But,” I pleaded, but he shook his head.\n\nWhen the tears started streaming from my eyes, he pulled me in close and put his arm around me.\n\n“It’s all right, Mark, it’s all right,” he whispered as he hugged me.\n\nWhen  the tears stopped flowing, he took my hand and led me back to my little  bedroom. He sat with me, whispering to me, until I’d fallen asleep  again.\n\nWhen I woke up the next  morning, I was startled and confused about the events of last night. I  threw the covers aside, thinking about what I’d seen, about Lina, and  raced through the house.\n\n“Grandpa!” I called out repeatedly, desperately trying to find him.\n\nThe moment I found him, he laughed.\n\n“Now what’s all this ruckus about this early in the morning?”\n\n“Last night, the cows, and Lina, and that, that thing,” I rambled.\n\n“Now, now, what are you talking about?”\n\n“The monster, in the pasture, the one that went after Lina! You were there in the living room and, and-“\n\n“You had a bad dream, Mark, that’s all. Lina’s all right and so is the rest of the heard,” he said, giving me a warm smile.\n\n“Now, how about some breakfast?”\n\nNow,  of course, I didn’t give up, but grandpa assured me he’d been fast  asleep all night, there’d been no noises and there had been no monsters.\n\nWhat can I say, I was a little kid after all and so, I believed him.\n\nBefore long, my stay at grandpa’s home ended, and I returned to the city and the concrete jungle that was my home.\n\nWhile  I had fond memories of the weeks I’d spent with grandpa, the experience  was haunted by that terrible night, that terrible dream.\n\nThe  school year came and went, but next summer I didn’t return to grandpa’s  farm, I couldn’t. I was only ever there with my parents, on short, rare  visits, but it never felt the same again.\n\nAn  oppressive atmosphere hung over the old farmhouse and had transformed  the place I’d loved so much into something darker, something sinister.\n\nI’m  an adult now, and for long years I’d never returned to his farm. It was  a month ago that I finally went on one last trip there with my parents.\n\nGrandpa  was older now, much older. The strong, sturdy farmer of my childhood  had been replaced by a tiny, shriveled old man that seemed lost in his  own bed.\n\nA stroke, the doctor had told us. At his age, recovery was out of the question.\n\nFor long hours we sat with him, watching over him. When my mother couldn’t take it anymore, my father led her from the room.\n\nLeft  alone, next to his sleeping body, I took out my phone. I was browsing  the web, listening to his low, rattling breath, when a bony hand  suddenly gripped my arm. Grandpa’s eyes were wide open, staring right at  me.\n\nHis mouth was moving, but nothing but another low rattle escaped his mouth.\n\n“Grandpa, what is it? Are you okay? Are you in pain? Do you want me to-?”\n\nI broke up when his nails dug into my arm and he pulled me closer.\n\n“You’ve got to,” he pressed out, his voice as quiet as a whisper.\n\n“I’ve got to what?”\n\nGrandpa was panting, breathing hard, sweat glistening on his forehead.\n\n“Make sure there’s never more than one of them!”\n\n“More than one of what?”\n\n“You saw,” he brought out. “That night, that thing, you saw.”\n\n“Saw what?” I asked, but the answer came to me a moment later.\n\nHe wrinkled his brow, opened his mouth again, but it took him long seconds to bring forth the words.\n\nHis voice was as thin as a whisper, but I heard the two words he was saying.\n\nEventually  his voice trailed off and after a second his grip loosened. He held my  gaze for another long second before he closed his eyes again.\n\nFor a second I thought the worst had happened, but then I saw the small of his chest moving. He’d fallen asleep.\n\nYet, my fears hadn’t vanished, my terrors hadn’t evaporated. I knew what he’d said just now, what he’d told me.\n\nThat  night so long ago, the night he’d told me had been nothing but a dream,  had been real. What I’d seen out there had been all but real, and as an  adult, I finally understood what I’d witnessed.\n\nSome  sort of creature was out there, out in the wild, and on certain nights  it came here. It came for the cows to spread its seed and to create its  ghastly offspring.\n\nI don’t know  what that thing is, I don’t know where it came from, but even now, even  after grandpa’s funeral, I remember what grandpa had called it.\n\n[The Cow King.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "Not to brag or nothing, but I’ve donated blood 36 times in the past 8 years. I started donating when I was 22 and in a couple months I’ll be the big 3-0. I don’t even remember why I started doing it. I just wanted to help others and give back. Do something for someone else for a change, ya know? \n\nAnyway, I started regularly scheduling blood donations about every other month give or take. It got to the point that the volunteers that were working at the stations would recognize me. I got to know their names and even became friends with a few of them. One of them, Ren, became a gym buddy of mine. I even got the number of a volunteer. Meghan I think? We texted a couple times but after that she ghosted me and I stopped seeing her at the drives too.\n\nLook, I know this is making me sound like some self righteous douche and I get it, but it’s just a very easy way to do good. All it takes is a little bit of time and an arm. Plus you get cookies and juice after, so why not?\n\nAs the years passed I’ve noticed some changes here and there about the drives. For one, the actual rooms for the drives were smaller. Like, sometimes harry potter closet small. I’ve also seen a whole lot of volunteers leave. Like they just straight up stop showing up after a while. New people come, but they don’t stay.\n\nI was talking to Ren and he was trying to convince me to volunteer. He was all like, “We need all the help we can get, man, come on. You wouldn’t be sticking people or caring for anybody. All you’d have to do is work the front desk, greet people, and turn on that charisma to try and pull people in. Easy shit.”\n\nI wasn’t sure I wanted to volunteer, not because I didn’t want to help more, I’m always down for giving back. But, it’s like, I do so much, I have a full time job and a girl I’m seeing occasionally. Although my full time job is work from home so I do make my own hours. And I’m kinda hitting a rough patch with this girl, I’m trying to keep it casual, but she’s talking about more. I’ve also been told I’m a very nice, easy going person that’s hard to say no to, so, what the hell, why not?\n\nI signed up to work for a blood drive and, to be honest, it was sad! They set up camp in a public library and, like, no one came. Not literally no one. But it wasn’t a lot. Over 6 hours there were only 4 people who donated. That includes me. \n\nIt seemed to, like, rub off on people. All the other volunteers were huddling close to each other and whispering about the bad turn out. They looked really worried, but when I tried talking to them, they’d just smile and act like everything was cool. But everything was *not* cool. I started texting people, asking if they were free to come donate, but I only got my sister and her girlfriend to come out and that was cause I said I’d buy them food. That brought our total to 6. Still not great.\n\nAround the end of the day Ren was talking to another volunteer, Diane. Diane was, like, the head volunteer or something like that. She’s the person everyone seemed to go for with questions or anything. It was easy to tell she was in charge, formally or not.\n\nWhen I was walking over to them Ren looked up at me and said hi with waaay too much enthusiasm. Like he was making up for the fact that he was whispering and being all sneaky sad. \n\nI asked if it was normally this slow and Diane said, “This is a particularly bad day for us.” Diane was maybe in her 40’s or something and I think she’s married. Didn’t look like she had a kid or if she did she still took *very* good care of her figure. Did have a bit of RBF though.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to try and be more optimistic so I said something like, “I’m sure it’ll pick up soon, right?” giving my always charming smile and keeping things light.\n\nRen went with me and said, “Oh, yeah. We’ll get more donors and then more blood and everything’ll turn out alright. Right, Diane?” He looked to her to see if she’d join the vibe. \n\nShe didn’t. She just made some sour puss face and said, “Unless something tragic happens or a local celebrity is hurt, things aren’t going to pick up any time soon,” then she stomped off. \n\n“Yo, dude, she always like that?” I looked back to Ren and he had his head in his hand. “Man, you good?”\n\nRen looked ready to cry. He’s always had this desperation about him that was just sad. “We’re in a blood shortage right now. We don’t have nearly enough blood. I’ve seen the people this affects. I know what will happen if we don’t get more blood. People--” he stopped and let out a big sigh. His breath smelled like garlic bread. He shook his head at me, his hair shaking with it, and said, “If things don’t pick up soon people will die. That’s just a fact.” \n\nThat was hard to hear.\n\nFor the next three weeks I donated not my blood but my time. I mean, I would’ve donated my blood too, but I had to wait.\n\nAnyway, over the next three weeks I volunteered out on 11 more drives. Just a reminder, I have a full time job too, so, 11 was a lot. Over the course of those 11 drives I saw less and less people coming in, sometimes no one at all, and the other volunteers seemed to get real panicy. This last drive they were set up in some back room of a church. Everyone was  packing up for the night and it was already pretty dark out. I needed to piss but as I was heading to the bathroom I saw a volunteer crying. I don’t just mean little crying, she was damn near sobbing! I came up behind her and asked if she was okay and she jumped when I spoke. \n\n“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you,” I said smiling. She smiled back and wiped a tear. “Are you okay?”\n\nMelissa (her name was Melissa) didn’t  look too hot. Her eyes were puffy and her hands shook as she put them together around her necklace. It was a cross or crucifix. I don't really know the difference. I’m not super religious, but this girl was. Not, like, an-in-your-face *you need jesus* type of religious, but it was still the only thing I knew about her. She had one of those jesus fish bumper stickers, she wore a cross (or a crucifix), and I saw her praying every time just before we open. So I asked her if she was okay and with her hands clasped around her necklace she pushed a smile as she said, “Just. Nervous.” She said it like that too, as if it were two sentences with a pause in the middle. *Just. Nervous.*\n\n“Why? Is everything okay?” I noticed for the first time that she had a very nice smile. She had those big doe eyes and her hair pulled back behind her ears. Also her shirt was lower cut than I would’ve thought given the jesus thing. She honestly was like, real cute.\n\n“‘Is everything okay?’” At first I thought she was asking me and got confused, but she was just repeating the question, thinking it over, eyes up to the ceiling. Or maybe up to like the heavens or something, I dunno. There was a good 5 seconds before she answered and all she said was, “I pray that everything will be okay.” Then she smiled again, a real pretty smile, and with a hand still over her necklace she walked past me. \n\nAnyway, I went and pissed then joined everyone else back in the little side room. Everyone just seemed so... well, like Melissa. They all seemed nervous. They were whispering amongst each other and I walked up to Ren and put a hand on his shoulder to get his attention and he freaked. He jumped, which made me jump. \n\n“Sorry. I thought you were someone else.”\n\n“Who, dude? Why is everyone so jumpy? What’s going on?”\n\n“Nothin. Everything’s fine. Look, I was thinking, why don’t you head now?”\n\n“No,” Diane said as she listened in on our conversation. She was standing on the other side of the room so when she spoke everyone turned to look at her. She closed the gap between Ren and myself standing, honestly a little too close for comfort. Diane looked me in the eyes with an intense glare. I got the sense she was trying to, like, intimidate me and for a moment it almost worked. So, she looked me in the eye and said, “Do you want to continue volunteering with us?”\n\nEverybody stopped what they were doing and watched. I let out a laugh and said, “Yeah! Of course!” \n\n“Are you sure about this?” Diane said as if I was making a very serious decision. “If you continue to volunteer and help us out, you can’t leave after tonight.”\n\nI looked towards Ren expecting him to be hiding a laugh or something because this just seemed very ridiculous. *Can’t leave after tonight?* Of course I can! That’s how volunteering works! Everyone was taking this so seriously and yes, I know we’re in a blood shortage and we haven’t had a lot of donors, but to act like this is a crucial decision felt so weird. My opinion on that has changed. \n\n“Yeah, I still want to help volunteer,” I said, trying my best to sound stern and match their seriousness. \n\nDiane opened her mouth to say something but there were three incredibly loud knocks on the side door to the church. Everybody froze and looked towards Diane. She took a deep breath and said to me, “I hope you mean that.”\n\nDiane started towards the door and everyone followed her. Ren put his arm around my shoulder and said, “I made a mistake asking for your help.”\n\nI gave a polite chuckle and said, “It’s okay, dude. I’m fine.” He gave me a pity look, like I was some idiot child or something, then followed Diane. I was right behind them.\n\nDiane opened the door and there he was. A man stood in the doorway, the light pouring around him making him look almost unearthly. Like he was chiseled from stone by the hand of a god. He had a strong jaw with a nice even face and that perfect amount of stubble. He was tall. Taller than me. I’m 6’1”, but he had three or four inches on me at least. His hair was midnight black and eyes were a piercing dark blue. Looking into his eyes sent shivers up my spine, and suddenly I was cold. He had a good frame, in solid shape, and he stood with his back perfectly straight, shoulders back, and hands stuffed into the pockets of his ankle length jacket as he towered over everybody. \n\n“Trying to hide in a church?” His voice was a deep bassy silky smooth voice that echoed in my own head. I wanted him to keep talking. What I really wanted was for him to talk to me. I had a desire to be noticed by him, but I also felt that if he did see me I’d panic. \n\nDiane tried to start talking, but fumbled over her words. She cleared her throat and started again, “This is just where we were set up today. We’re not hiding from anybody.”\n\nThe man said nothing, but instead took 5 large steps back, his black shoes making a pleasant clop on the concrete. Diane took several small steps forward and we all walked after her. I can’t speak for anybody else, but I know that I didn’t have the conscious thought to walk forward, I just moved. \n\nAs the man stepped back he revealed he was not alone. There were 6 of us, Diane, Ren, Melissa, two people named Luke and Amania, and myself. There were only 5 of them, but it still felt as if we were outnumbered. The main guy stood with two people to either side of him, and they all had that same breathtaking beauty to them. There were two guys and two girls, all tall and stunning and all with expressions of steel and faces that looked constructed to be perfect. \n\nOne of the men had a clean shaven face and short perfectly placed brown hair. His eyes were big with small dark pupils. The other man had a wonderfully groomed beard and long golden blond hair that flowed to his shoulders. The woman center right had short auburn hair that was longer on one side with a clenched jaw and cheek bones as sharp as swords. The woman next to her had long onyx black hair and hypnotic neon bright eyes that I couldn’t look away from. She looked most like the main gentleman. They all wore those long black jackets and they stood straight up and above us, they’re feet practically gliding above the ground. \n\nThe cold air hit my bare arms and I shivered. I wanted my coat, but I knew I couldn’t leave. I didn’t want to leave. I had to know what this man would say.\n\n“What do you have?” he said. He didn’t have any detectable accent, but his voice was very distinct, very american, and very pleasant. \n\nDiane turned toward Amania and said something in a whisper. Amania hesitated, looked back to the man, and then ran inside. After a second or two Amania came back out with a reusable bag that she held out to the man. He snatched it up and she flinched. He smiled at her fear and without looking held the bag out to the woman with the deadly cheek bones. She looked inside the bag and sighed. After closing the bag she turned her eyes back to all of us, seeing all of us together and each of us individually at the same time. “It’s not enough,” she said in a cold German accent. The man in the center tightened his jaw and tilted his head as he looked at Diane. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. \n\n“James, I know we’re low and I’m sorry, but it’s all we have. We don’t even have anything for the patients or to give to--”\n\nThe man, James, raised a hand and Diane stopped, almost as if unable to speak. His hand was large and he slowly curled his fingers and put his hand back into his pocket before speaking. “I do not care about what you need.” He spoke slowly, not needing to worry about losing our attention. “I care about what you owe us. Our payment that we agreed upon. And, as she said,” he motioned towards the woman on his right with a fluid movement, “it is not enough. Now, you have been short the past three times we’ve come to collect.”\n\n“James, I--”\n\n“Hush.” He drew the *sh* of the word out getting quieter until he was silent. “You disappoint me, Diane.” A breath escaped her as if she was physically hurt by that.\n\nThe woman with the entrancing eyes was scanning the crowd and she stopped on me as I stared back. She smiled at me and I turned my eyes to the ground, feeling embarrassed and scared, like a grade school boy. I peeked back up at her and she was still looking at me, still smiling, so I looked away. \n\nI looked towards Diane, who was also looking at the ground. It was hard to tell, but it seemed as if her eyes were watering. James took two loud and careful steps towards Diane. *Clop. Clop.* It left an uncomfortably small distance between them. “Look. At. Me.” Diane craned her neck to look up at James. He leaned forward and down, hovering over her and in a whisper we could all still hear he said, “You know what must be done now, don’t you?” \n\nDiane swallowed. I suddenly felt very bare and exposed. My bones turned to ice.\n\nJames stood up and started to survey the rest of us, walking back and forth. When his eyes met mine I felt everything freeze and goosebumps run across my entire body. He looked away from me and I released the breath I was holding. I’m sure he only looked at me for a brief second, but it felt like minutes. He stopped pacing and his eyes landed on someone. I followed his gaze to Melissa, who had her head down, eyes closed, and was holding her crucifix as she prayed inaudibly. \n\nJames turned to the man with the long hair and they seemed to talk to each other only in a glance. The man walked forward, his boots making a heavier thud than James’s shoes. He stood in front of Melissa, his shadow falling over her, his toes to hers, and she stopped praying and opened her eyes. Slowly she looked up at this man. When she met his gaze I saw a tear roll down her cheek and her lips curled up like a small smile. \n\nThis man looked like the one she prayed too, long hair and beard, but he certainly wasn’t here to save her. \n\nIt happened before I had time to register it. His hands moved in a blur to Melissa’s head and his sharp daggered teeth were over her throat. Melissa let out a pained moan and her arms went limp at her sides.  I saw the color drain from Melissa’s face and looked away as the sounds continued. My legs felt suddenly weak as a wave of horror and relief hit me.\n\nWhen he was done the man opened his hands and let Melissa drop to the ground. I looked back to see his mouth stained red. He wiped it on the sleeve of his coat indelicately and smiled as he fell back in line.\n\nJames smiled down at Diane and said, “Next time, it’s everyone.”\n\nHe turned on his heels and walked away, the rest of his group followed. All five of them left, joining the darkness of the night, as the six, now five, of us stood in the sickly yellow light of the church. \n\nIt’s been three weeks since then and these meetings are monthly. Things have not gotten better, but not much. I hold Melissa’s crucifix in my pocket now. Not that it does much, but I feel safer having it there. We did get a new volunteer too. A nice sweet girl named Lyanne. Diane told her to take next week off. \n\nPlease, oh God please, if you can donate blood, do it. It’s a matter of [life and death.](https://www.redcrossblood.org/give.html/find-drive?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D48102861298134648994468031603124344829%7CMCORGID%3D723A22C757518E2C7F000101%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1674226551)",

        "text": "During my years as a park ranger, I encountered things that would terrify the most tenacious trekker. However, nothing on God’s Earth has ever given me as much cause for existential dread as the Undertunnels of the Grand Canyon. Those treacherous tunnels were not carved by human hands, and they certainly were not intended for human eyes. I have heard so many tales of uncovered underground passages in the Grand Canyon. It’s not a new concept. But there’s a difference between a hidden passage and the Undertunnels.\n\nI probably should have left this place long ago, but I think I’m too afraid. Like Pandora’s Box, once certain things have been learned, they cannot be unlearned. I feel I have an obligation to stay here until my dying day. Besides, no matter how far I might be able to run, it would never be far enough. There might be Undertunnels beneath all places.\n\nI don’t actually work as a ranger anymore, but I like to say that I still perform a service to the park because I frequent the bars and other hospitality attractions of the area. I keep an eye and an ear on things. I still hear awful tales. That’s how I know I’m not alone. I know there are others who have seen what I saw several years ago.\n\nLook, I’m not trying to deter you from coming here. I’m simply saying that you shouldn't ever seek the horrors that hide in the hovels of the Grand Canyon. That only applies to those of you who explore the gorge itself. If you simply want to admire vibrant vistas atop the edges of the canyon, then go for it. Book a tour. It’s well worth the experience. But I would strongly advise against exploring what lies in its depths. Most people never stumble upon an entrance to the Undertunnels, but why would you take the chance?\n\nI hope you will respect my privacy, and that’s why I’m going to refer to myself by the nickname that my youngest daughter, Eliza, bestowed upon me: *Mr Danger, the Park Ranger*. And he goes on adventures with his sidekick, *Ms Sunshine, the Porcupine*. Eliza loves her porcupine costume. I have always marvelled at my daughter’s boundless creativity. My wife, Riley, on the other hand, prefers for us to stick to jollier topics.\n\n“Why do you fill her head with the idea that you once had such a terrifying job?” Riley asked.\n\n“Because life as a financial advisor is so dull in comparison,” I replied.\n\n“Boo! Boring!” Eliza groaned, making a farting noise.\n\n“Exactly what I want to say to my boss every day,” I said.\n\nBefore any of you start panicking that I’ve been traumatising my ten-year-old daughter with detailed accounts of horrifying things that happened to me, I only tell ghost stories. Never anything real. Stories of trolls in the rocks and alien visitors. Perhaps it helps me deal with my trauma to create fictional horror stories.\n\n“Can I tell a spooky story next?” Eliza asked.\n\nI grinned and said, “Go for it, Ms Sunshine.”\n\n“It’s the story of a witch who wants-” Eliza began.\n\n“- No witches,” I firmly stated.\n\nAnd after that conversation, earlier this evening, I was forced to relive the most haunting night of my entire life. The night I spent in the belly of the Grand Canyon, tirelessly hunting for two teenage girls who had gone missing. I hoped and prayed for an easy search-and-rescue job. I feared that I would find two injured spelunkers in some hard-to-reach crevice. That was my worst-case scenario. I had no concept of the *real* worst-case scenario.\n\nTraversing the rocky terrain of the colossal chasm that spans Grand Canyon National Park, I found myself looking up at the wondrous walls that rose like earthly skyscrapers above me. At first, I felt soothed and comforted by their presence. However, as the sun began to set and my torch became my new guide, those canyon walls shape-shifted into something far more insidious. They no longer felt like warm blankets. They felt like the walls of my coffin.\n\nMy harrowing thoughts were interrupted by the fluttering wings of a crow that circled above me. I ignored the creature, pressing onwards, but I could feel its black eyes boring into the crown of my head. It was watching me as I walked. When I was a park ranger, I liked to think of myself as a man who had a strong affinity with all animals, but that cawing crow evoked a frightful feeling in my heart. Even as a whippersnapper on the job, and one who, at that point in my life, hadn’t *personally* experienced anything terrible, my animal instinct was well-honed. *Come on, Mr Danger*, I told myself. *You’re not about to be bested by a crow, are you? What would Ms Sunshine say if she could see you now?*\n\nI clutched my torch tightly in my right hand and started waving it around in a manic, frantic motion, attempting to shoo the bird away. At that moment, I was startled by the sudden sound of footsteps from the darkness ahead of me. With lightning-fast reflexes, I shone the torch light in the direction of the sound. Somebody emerged from the side of a rock, and their flashlight came into view.\n\n“Steady! It’s me!” Jack cried. “I thought you might want some help with the search. Any luck? I’ve found something quite promising.”\n\nJack, as I’ve named him for the purpose of this story, was a fellow park ranger. He was a wizened old fellow, and I always viewed him as a second father figure. He was a little odd, and his jokes often elicited eye rolls, but I’d never been so relieved to see his goofy grin. Hand still trembling, my light erratically danced and darted across the rocks between us.\n\n“No sign of them. You scared the absolute shit out of me, Jack,” I sighed. “It’s a good job I wore my brown trousers.”\n\nJack laughed and beckoned for me to follow him.\n\n“So, what’s your promising find?” I asked.\n\n“Well, let’s just say we should be home and putting our feet up in no time at all. I think I’ve found the cave system that the two girls must’ve explored,” He explained, leading the way. “It’s not one that I recognise, truth be told, but I suppose I might be getting forgetful in my old age. Anyway, I’m almost certain they entered it. There was a campfire by the entrance. Recently burned out. *Must* be them.”\n\n“Fuck,” I groaned. “Last thing I want to do at nine o’clock on a Saturday evening is fish some dumb, unprepared, injured kids out of a cave.”\n\n“Better than fishing some dumb, unprepared, *dead* kids out of a cave, eh?” Jack pointed out. “Let’s hope your version of events ends up being the true one.”\n\nI solemnly nodded my head, thinking of the countless lives that had been lost in that canyon. Whenever I had cause to moan or groan, I reminded myself of why I’d taken that job. I reminded myself of the people I was trying to protect. It was on nights like those that a ranger had to prove their worth. I prayed that we would find two *live* hikers.\n\n“Huh,” Jack said.\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\nAs we rounded a tall stack of rocks, my friend scratched his chin thoughtfully, casting his light onto a smouldering pile of sticks. I was looking at the burnt-out campfire, as promised, but there was no sign of the mysterious cave entrance. Just a solid canyon wall, as there had always been in that spot, as far as I could recall. I was certain that Jack, who was thirty years my senior, had started to lose his marbles. But none of the park rangers had the heart to tell him to hang up the hat. It was what he loved. The park was the thing that kept him alive.\n\n“I know you’re gonna laugh,” Jack sighed. “But I’m telling you that there was a cave entrance *right* in that very spot, kiddo. I mean… I was right about the campfire, wasn’t I?”\n\n“I wasn’t gonna accuse you of lying, Jack,” I replied. “It’s dark, and neither of us can see shit out here. Even with these flashlights, the human mind is a fickle thing. It loves to play tricks. You know that. But let’s not despair. We must be on the right track. You’re right about that. The campfire is a good sign.”\n\n“Yeah, I suppose you’re- Oh…” Jack stopped, looking to the side of my head.\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\nHe chuckled. “Got a little something on your shoulder, partner.”\n\nI swivelled my head to the left and screamed. There, staring back at me with hollow eyes, was the black crow that had been stalking me. It was silently perching on my shoulder. I hadn’t even *felt* it there. It hadn’t so much as made a sound or moved into my field of vision. It was a gaunt, ghastly statue, posing with such stillness that it might as well have been a taxidermy bird.\n\nJack cackled until he wheezed and spluttered. He continued to be of no use whatsoever, whilst I flailed around in a mad panic, striving to release the creature from my shoulder. Eventually, *thankfully*, it flew away. To my park ranger friend, it was an amusing incident. To me, it was something much worse. I didn’t like the entire situation. The disappearing cave entrance. The eerily-serene bird. None of it. Not one bit.\n\nAs I said, I have good instincts. And I don’t fear animals, for the record. I never have. I care deeply even for nature’s most ominous and overlooked creatures. Crows had never bothered me before that fateful night, but that crow was like none I’d ever seen before. I didn’t know what was wrong with it, but I knew that the mere sight of it filled me with immense horror. It was dangerous, and I’m not talking about the fun and mischief that Mr Danger and Ms Sunshine love. This was *real* danger. Danger that I’d forgotten all about until Eliza reminded me of something that had been hiding in the darkened recesses of my fractured, forlorn mind.\n\n“Wait…” Jack said. “It *moved*.”\n\nSuddenly, my park ranger friend was sprinting past me, so I turned to see what had stirred him. And then I saw it. On the canyon wall opposite to the one we had been facing, there was a cave entrance. It was one I was certain I’d never seen in that area before, and that made me truly start to question everything. Maybe Jack hadn’t lost his marbles. That could only mean something more unsettling was happening. Either we were both incompetent park rangers or something unnatural had happened.\n\n“Jack,” I started. “Let’s just talk about this for a moment.”\n\nJack had already reached the mouth of the cave, and he was jubilantly dancing in the entrance. Before I even had a chance to talk about the horrible feeling in the centre of my chest, I spotted something that snapped me out of my feverish stupor.\n\n“Jack!” I warned. “Wolf!”\n\nJack immediately stopped dancing in the entrance and cast his torch light onto a large, grey wolf that was slinking towards him. It did not growl. It did not make a sound, in fact. It simply took long, purposeful strides towards my frozen friend.\n\n“Easy, buddy,” Jack calmly said. “I don’t have any treats for you, and I’m not as tasty as I look. I promise. Now, ordinarily, I’d scare you off with the rubber bullets, but I’m a little unprepared this evening, I have to admit. So, I’m warning you not to get too close. Otherwise, you’ll get the butt of the torch.”\n\n“Jack,” I said, speaking with the same air of calmness. “Keep your cool.”\n\n“I’ve been doing this a lot longer than you, kid. Don’t worry about- Fuck!”\n\nThe wolf moved abnormally-quickly, pouncing towards Jack, who slammed his torch into the animal’s face. The creature, along with Jack’s torch, went flying to the ground. It did not whimper or even falter for more than a second. It was calm. Too calm. The wolf simply clambered back to its feet and eyeballed a now-torchless Jack. I shone my own light onto the cave entrance, illuminating my defenceless friend and the wolf that had started to prowl towards him once more.\n\n“Jack, just let me-” I started.\n\n“I have to head into the cave,” Jack cried.\n\nIn a flash, my reckless ranger companion had sprinted into the cave. The darkness swallowed him and the wolf that was hot on his tail. I ran after the pair of them, lighting the way with my shaky torch.\n\nEntering the passage through the canyon wall, I tried to focus all of my attention on Jack and the wolf, who were already out of sight in the labyrinth of tunnels, but I couldn’t help fixating on the peculiar noises that engulfed me. Rocks were shifting, as if the canyon were continuously reshuffling and restructuring itself.\n\n“Jack!” I screeched.\n\nI tumbled through a hole and cut my elbows on a rocky slope that led down to a sprawling, cavernous opening. I scrambled to my feet and quickly picked up my torch, fearing what I might see in the centre of the underground space. In the centre of the cave, I expected to see the wolf tearing my friend limb from limb. What I actually saw was far worse because it couldn’t be explained.\n\nJack was there, but he was not facing a wolf. He was facing something indescribably horrible. A gangly creature towered over him, skin like a decaying corpse, and limbs twice as long as those of any ordinary human. It was a monstrously-magnified version of a person. No, not a person. A *witch*.\n\nA skin-walker, as Native Americans would no doubt call it. The stuff of legends. A monster that I had only ever seen in frightening fables. Not something real. And yet, my eyes were telling me a different truth. I could see the thing with my own eyes. The thing that goes by so many different names in so many different places. Still, no matter what name it is given, everybody agrees that it is an unholy thing. An abomination not meant for our world. Death incarnate.\n\n“Jack!” I near-soundlessly gasped.\n\nMy friend began to levitate, his writhing body’s ascension orchestrated by the gnarled, brittle fingers of the inhuman thing before it. The witch, a silent and serene puppeteer, continued to raise her hand. Utilising some unseen evil force, she moved my wriggling friend higher and higher into the air, watching his illuminated form in my torch light. The creature was as still and unwavering as the crow and the wolf. And that was when I pieced the parts of the puzzle together. I remembered the feeling of being stalked by the crow. Those beastly black eyes.\n\nA sudden snapping sound broke me out of my disturbing daydream, instead thrusting me into a *much* more deeply-disturbing taste of reality. Jack released a scream that ricocheted off the walls of the enclosed space, as his legs bent the wrong way. The bones broke, one by one, and protruded from the back of his knees, as his calves were pulled up to his waist. His jaw started to droop, and I realised that he was moments away from losing consciousness. As morbid as it sounds, I prayed that he would faint. I prayed that he would not be conscious during his own painful demise.\n\nAs the witch began to snap his arms inwards and contort his body into a box shape, my friend’s head finally lulled forwards. Looking at his mangled, compressed form, I realised that he wasn’t unconscious. He was dead. At that moment, the rocks on one of the walls crumbled away, revealing a stack of boxes and, surprisingly, a red wooden door. As the witch opened one of the boxes and began to crumple my friend’s mangled, desecrated carcass into it, I crept around the back of her.\n\nShe busied herself with the act of packing her latest victim into a wooden, gold-lined treasure box, and she did not seem to notice the torch light that was moving around her, as I inches closer and closer to the red door on the far wall. Stealthily, I made it across the cave and placed my hand on the door handle. The creature screeched.\n\nIn a blind panic, I swung the door open and closed it behind me. To my utter surprise, I was facing a long unlit tunnel. A tunnel constructed of red bricks on the walls, floor, and ceiling. The *real* Undertunnels. This was more than just a cave system. It was, I realised, the witch’s lair. There was no way I could survive by going backwards, so I had to push forwards.\n\nLighting the way with my torch, I ran blindly through the unlit red-brick tunnel, not knowing what I might find around every bend. Suddenly, there were multiple forking passageways. I had no idea which way to go. I just knew that I’d heard the red door open behind me and heard the slow, steady, still-serene padding footsteps of the thing that had brutally massacred Jack.\n\n“Help!”\n\nThe voice cried from a tunnel to my left, so I immediately followed the sound. Cowering in the dead-end fork of the tunnel was a girl. She must’ve been eighteen or nineteen, fully kitted out in hiking gear, and coated from head to toe in blood. It didn’t look like hers.\n\n“Oh, thank God!” She whimpered. “We have to get out of here! That *thing* is coming for us.”\n\n“Where’s your friend?” I asked.\n\nThe girl’s lip trembled. “Alicia? She’s… She’s gone.”\n\n“Alicia… So, you’re Daniela, right?” I asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“I’m sorry about your friend, Daniela. I lost someone too. But we’re going to make it out of here,” I promised.\n\n“I think we should go back to the red door,” Daniela said. “We know the way back from there.”\n\nI shook my head, helping Daniela to her feet, and pointed a finger to my ear, indicating for her to listen. I was trying to show the girl that it wasn’t safe to go back the way we came. But I couldn’t hear the witch’s padding footsteps. I suddenly realised that *not* hearing her was far worse. Where was she?\n\n“What?” Daniela asked. “I don’t hear her.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean she’s not there. Come on,” I said.\n\nI led a begrudging Daniela farther into the depths of the tunnels, shaking as we rounded every corner. Every time I saw the coast was clear, it was both a relief and a fright. Not knowing where she might be hiding was a horror like no other. And then, from the depths of the brick tunnels, we heard a sound. Crying.\n\n“It’s a trick,” Daniela protested. “Don’t go towards it.”\n\n“It sounds like a girl,” I said. “Maybe Alicia’s still alive!”\n\nI followed the sound of the crying, thankful for the fact that the tunnel no longer seemed to be forming off into different directions. I was relatively certain that it was more of an interconnected circuit of tunnels, rather than a maze. All routes would’ve led me to the same place, eventually. A wooden, colourless door. And there was crying on the other side.\n\nDaniela sobbed and said, “Don’t go in there.”\n\nI ignored her, motivated by a sense of duty and, perhaps, a smidge of stupidity. I burst through the door and found myself in a cavern much larger than the last one. And, thankfully, there was a cave entrance at the far side. I could see the outside world. It was a horribly dark night, but it looked like a glowing beacon of hope. Anything was lighter than the hellish Undertunnels of the witch.\n\nCasting the light around the cave, I eventually found Alicia, pinned down by rocks on her arms. Tauntingly close to freedom. She was staring blankly ahead and bawling her eyes out. When she saw my flashlight, she screamed.\n\n“Help!” Alicia wailed. “I’m trapped!”\n\nIt definitely *felt* like a trap, but I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I hadn’t tried. Moreover, yet again, my instinct was telling me that I was looking at Alicia. It wasn’t the witch. I could just feel it in my bones. I darted over to the girl and heaved the rocks from her arms. There were cuts and bruises along her limp limbs, so I hoisted Alicia to her feet.\n\nShe screeched when she saw Daniela.\n\n“Get her away from me!” Alicia cried.\n\n“Alicia?” Daniela replied. “It’s me!”\n\nAlicia shook her head and gently nodded at the far wall of the cave. I turned my head to see what the girl had been eyeballing when I first entered the cavernous room. I was horrified to see a girl’s body on the ground. Lifeless and twisted into an unimaginable shape. Not just any girl. *Daniela*.\n\nThere were two of them.\n\nAs I turned my torch light back to the Daniela who had just followed me from the Undertunnels, she nonchalantly threw a smile our way. And yet, as calm as she may have been, it was the most unhinged and malicious smile I have ever seen. Alicia and I slowly backed towards the cave exit, watching as the fake Daniela started to grow in height. Her limbs started to elongate and her hair fell out. Within seconds, I was staring at the horrific creature that had crushed my friend alive.\n\n“Run!” I screamed.\n\nAs we sprinted for the exit, it began to close. The rocks shifted around it, slowly shrinking the hole that was our only path to freedom. With seconds to spare, Alicia dived through the opening, and I followed.\n\nTurning to face the closing hole, I caught one final glimpse of the inhuman creature, before it was entombed in the wall of the Grand Canyon.\n\nI have never told anyone that tale. And I was a park ranger for many years after that. If anything, understanding that such things existed was my reason for continuing. There are other reasons that I eventually abandoned that line of service.\n\nBut my duty has never really died. And, when Eliza reminded me of witches, I realised it was time to finally tell my story. You may or may not choose to believe me.\n\nNone of that matters. But, please, I beg you, do not enter the Undertunnels of the Grand Canyon.",

        "text": "I slapped myself awake after nearly dozing off behind the wheel. I glanced at the dashboard and saw the digital clock that read: “3:22 AM”.  \n\n“Only 2 more hours.. Just.. got to.. Stay.. awake..”\n\nI mumbled to myself and then slapped myself awake once more.  It was December 24th, 2022. I was driving to my Mothers house to surprise her for a Christmas visit. We hadn’t seen each other since I moved out of the country in 2008. I used the excitement of seeing my mother again as motivation to stay awake. It worked somewhat, until a few minutes later when I was dozing off again. Eventually I decided it wasn't a safe idea to keep driving under the influence of sleep deprivation, so I pulled over and shut my eyes. A deep sleep was pulling me in fast, but I was jolted awake by a terrible screeching sound. Suddenly, I was filled with intense paranoia.  I shakily and quickly locked my car which I had forgotten to do in my desperation for shut-eye. \n\nA few minutes had passed and I heard nothing. I knocked it down to it being just an animal. I was in the rural countryside, afterall. I attempted to submit to the deep sleep once more, but I was awoken by the same, terrible screeching sound.\n\n“God Damnit!” I yelled in frustration. The few hours of shut eye I desperately craved were being interrupted by an annoying… something.. That wouldn't leave my car alone. I put my keys in the ignition and decided I would drive for a little bit and pull over somewhere a little ahead.  I pulled over in my new spot, but I didn't immediately go to sleep. I wanted to make sure I wouldn't be interrupted by anything once more.\n\n My stomach dropped when I heard erratic footsteps catch up to my car.  I became incredibly nauseated when the inhuman and menacing chattering began. I was completely frozen with the most intense anxiety and paranoia I had ever experienced in my lifetime, and the chattering just kept getting louder. It was getting so incredibly loud, my ears felt violated and I felt as if I were being consumed into a pool of despair that I would never escape, that I would never even get the chance to escape from. \n\nSuddenly, I felt the chatter become bearable. It did not lessen, but it was just.. Bearable, almost as if I had been hearing it my whole life. I also realized that I could now move, I was no longer ridden with the paralyzing paranoia.  I put my hands on the wheel and screamed in pure terror. The hands weren’t mine. My hands had 7 fingers, all incredibly long, with longer fingernails. They were  a horrifying blue color and looked as if they were decaying. I screamed louder when I realized this wasn't my scream, either. My scream was deep, yet high at the same time. It sounded like an alien attempting to mimic a human screaming as a cruel joke.\n\n  I felt totally and utterly trapped. I wasn’t even me anymore, yet alone a human. I opened my door and started to run erratically on all fours, the only way I knew how. I began to chatter from pure discomfort. \n\nI decided to stop and turn to face my car. I saw 3 humans looking distraught around it. There was a teenage girl, an older man, and a middle aged woman. They suddenly came in to give each other a big hug. It was then that I realized what they had done. I didn't know who or what I was, but what I did know for certain was that they had turned me into what they were. I also realized that must have been the only fix to this. I began to chatter as loud as I could and charge towards them. \n\n“You aren’t supposed to do that! What the hell?” the older man yelled.\n\nI went even faster.\n\n“PLEASE STOP!” the Teenage girl yelled.\n\nI had reached them, I  closed my eyes and consumed them in the horror filled wave of chatter with no mercy, just as they did to me.  After a few minutes, I felt at peace. I opened my eyes and saw three horrifying figures in front of me. They were skinny, pale blue, their faces were incredibly disfigured and uncanny.  They began to chatter and I knew I had to book it. I jumped into my car and pressed the gas. I drove the rest of the way to my moms house. As I pulled into her driveway, I shakily brought down the mirror to confirm I was human now.\n\n I took a deep sigh of relief when the answer was affirmative.  I was about to open the door to exit the car when I noticed my fingernails were still incredibly long and disgust ran through me.  I had luckily brought some fingernail clippers, so that solved my problem.   My mother was excited to see me, but I was an absolute wreck the whole visit.  Everytime i  would shut my eyes I would vividly remember the screeching.. The chattering.. What those things looked like.. And most importantly, that I was one of them. \n\nIt has been 2 and a half weeks since this. I am struggling with severe paranoia and I can only manage to get a few hours of sleep a night and those few hours are filled with the same nightmares about the traumatic incident. I want to seek out therapy but they might send me away to a mental institution.. I feel so alone.",

        "text": "I was born in a Christian doomsday cult \"Cherubim Guard\". Being born in a cult made my childhood very different from everybody else. To start with, I never knew my parents. It did not bother me because it was the same case for all children in the cult. Elders told us that we - kids, were sent from the heavens. And God sent us for a reason to Earth - we had to lead the fight against armies of hell when Armageddon eventually happens. Like every other doomsday cult \"Cherubim Guard\" believe that end is coming soon and our time is limited. Our cult did not plan to surrender so easily because they had us - archangels. I and six other boys were taught that we are reincarnations of biblical archangels. From the moment we learn to walk we were trained as soldiers. We learned how to shoot, fight and survive. I was held in the biggest regard and under the highest pressure because my name is Michael and it was my duty to lead other boys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, stockpiling weapons and explosives caught the eye of the government and they deemed us a dangerous organization. One day, without warning, police stormed our compound. Believing that these were the promised end of the days, cult members started fighting back. Many people that I loved died that day and in the end, those who survived were arrested. I and the other kids were taken by child protective services. We were separated and put into foster care. My new family welcomed me with open arms. With their love and years of therapy, I managed to integrate into society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought that my cult life stayed in the past, but in the last weeks, I started having nightmares. In my dream, I see cities engulfed in fire and demonic creatures running on the streets. I tried to ignore them, but something strange happened last night. I was going home after work and I saw two guys harassing a woman. I decided to intervene. When I approached them commanding men to stop bothering the woman, they all turned to me. What I saw shocked me, all three of them looked like they were wearing half-translucent masks of human faces. Underneath the mask, I looked at red-skinned faces with eyes dark like charcoal, missing noses, huge mouths with shark-like teeth, and split tongues. I was paralyzed, I could not move, I could not breathe. The creatures laughed and said in chorus:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You will not stop me this time, brother!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they turned and just left. I stayed in that place frozen for solid fifteen minutes. I am in complete disarray, I don't understand what happened. Was it all hallucination? But I never had hallucinations before. This encounter brought back all my childhood memories. What if the end is coming? I must find my elders - what I saw is too much to ignore. But first, I need to go to a doctor to check the weird bumps on my shoulder blades.",

        "text": " \"I soup ate a word, dog,\"\n\nI couldn't make sense of it. The letter had been slipped underneath my door in an unmarked brown-paper envelope. I had no idea who it was from or what it meant.\n\nInside the envelope, in blue crayon, the message was haphazardly scrawled across an unsophisticated sheet of coloured card. It possessed a curiously infantile quality, and exuded an eerie feeling that took hold of me, and only grew stronger as I read and reread the letter.\n\nAs I sat there turning it over in my mind, my phone rang, freeing me from my trance. It was an unregistered number. I hesitated for a moment before answering.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said.\n\n\"I soup ate a word, dog,\" whispered the voice on the other end.\n\nThose very same words that’d been encircling my thoughts since they were slid underneath my doorframe, were now being spoken aloud, down a telephone line and directly into my ear.\n\n\"Who is this?\" I asked, “what do you mean? What do you want from me?”\n\nBut there was no reply, only static.\n\n“Don’t phone me again.” I said and hung up, putting my phone in Do Not Disturb mode for good measure.\n\nIn all likelihood, it was probably just some brat playing elaborate games. However, to quell my thoughts, I began to research the phrase. Of course, all of my searches came up blank. There seemed to be no connection or meaning behind the words at all.\n\nIt was complete nonsense. I pushed it away, into the back of my mind, and returned to work.\n\nDays and weeks passed me by, and all the while I received ever increasing quantities of letters and phone calls, all with the exact same phrase. Even after changing my number the calls persisted relentlessly.\n\n\"I soup ate a word, dog,\"\n\nWhat, I assumed, had begun as a childish and silly prank, had turned into a plainly purposive and distressing harassment. I couldn't bare it any longer, and so I asked around, and was put in touch with a well-regarded private investigator.\n\nHe arrived at my apartment, one month passed the initiation of my torment. In advance of his arrival, I’d collected all the letters and records of the phone calls, and we discussed the incidents at length together.\n\nHe gave me his assurance that everything would be *fine, just fine*, that he would get to the bottom of all of this. He confessed that he was a little bemused by my situation. I supposed that Private Investigators usually dealt with extra-marital affairs and that sordid sort of thing. Nevertheless he agreed to commit fully to my case, to the full extent of his abilities, and went away, promising to update me if he uncovered any information.\n\nA week or so later he called at my apartment again. He was very apologetic. He had been unable to uncover any reason or sense behind the messages, there was no precedent for this behaviour, and he could find no graphological hallmarks of ownership on the letters.\n\nHowever, he declared to me that there was, in his words, *a flower in the desert*. From the phone records, he was able to determine the likely origin of the calls. A derelict house on the outskirts of town. I thanked him for his time, paid him for his services and returned to my thoughts.\n\nI simply couldn't comprehend why any of this was happening, and what on earth it all had to do with some disused house? To me, it didn’t seem like *a flower*, it just seemed to be another sour note in the repetitive and disorienting melody that had been plaguing me for the last month and a half.\n\nPerhaps if I went there myself, I thought, then I could begin to understand. So, I took the car out and drove to the edge of town, parking outside the house. As soon as I stepped inside, I was hit with an intolerable disquiet.\n\nThe house stood there, alone and forlorn, the final residence on a demolished street. The rest of the neighbourhood cleared, presumably to make way for a new development.\n\nIn front of the derelict house was the last remaining garden of the neighbourhood, sparse and dry, home only to bindweed and creeping thistles. The paint on the exterior walls were tagged with spray paint and chipped away, revealing the crumbling brickwork. All the windows long shattered, and loose off their hinges, creaking and banging softly against their frames.\n\nAs I stepped into the porch, the rotten floorboards groaned as if they desired to break under my cautious weight. The walls inside were buckling and peeling, and with each step I dislodged plaster and dust from the ceiling which came tumbling down in crumbling clumps. As I moved further through the building, I caught glimpses of other rooms, with their musty aged furniture and shattered picture frames coated in dust. This house belonged only to time now.\n\nI searched the building and found nothing but cobwebs. Then, I noticed a door underneath the stairs, to the basement. I twisted the grimy handle. The basement itself was dark and I could see very little, so I turned on my phone torch. I took great care stepping down onto the staircase, again I’d found the wooden planks rotten and unstable. \n\nAs I arrived at the bottom of the stairs. There, etched into the wall, was the phrase that had tormented me so.\n\n\"I soup ate a word, dog,\"\n\nI abandoned all my attempts to comprehend the words, now accepting them as the obscure and sinister presence they had become. \n\nStanding there, consumed by that cryptic manifestation, I heard a dragging sound.\n\nTurning, I found myself confronted by the umbra of a figure. It was something like a young child, but her form was distorted, she had long boneless arms and was poised on top of two stubby spindled legs.\n\nShe lumbered toward me, half-falling, half-walking. She whispered those senseless words.\n\nThis creature surely was the source of my persecution.\n\n“I soup ate a word dog,” she whispered again, emphasising each word with terrible and peculiar inflections. There was no mistaking it. The voice from the phone calls belonged to her.\n\nThis was the pernicious being that had tormented me so, sending me those senseless letters and making those relentless phone calls. But why? What had I done to attract her ire?\n\nEvery step she took, she came closer to me, closer to the light. Her movements were graceless and disconcerting.\n\nIn my panic I’d taken leave of my senses. I scrambled away and attempted to surmount the staircase. The wood buckled underneath my indelicate movements, snapping, and sending me falling back to the cold basement floor.\n\nShe raised one of her lithe, boneless arms, and with a remarkable strength she took hold of my shirt and threw me back to the wall, pounding me against the etched phrase.\n\nShe held me there, suspended against the basement wall and whispered into my ear, each syllable coloured with erratic emphasis, \"I soup ate a word, dog, I soup! I soup!” Then she turned and plodded away, all the while maintaining her possession of me, keeping me fixed in place.\n\nI whimpered like a dog. There was nothing for me to say, no reasoning with this creature, and I was no match for her unwieldy force.\n\nShe held me there with ease, one arm pinning me mid-air against the wall, all the while busying herself with something in the corner of the room.\n\nEventually she turned back, and began to struggle towards me on her spinning top legs. She stepped back into the light again. I saw clearly her shadowy and warped features. Her rotten smile. Her dark and sunken eyes. And, in her spare hand, she held an open can of soup.\n\nShe compelled my mouth open, nursing me with the liquid, pouring it down into my throat. I could only swallow or choke, and as I drank the rancid soup, I felt my mind slipping away. I couldn't speak. I could hardly think. All I could do was listen to her repeat that damn phrase over, and over, and over.\n\n\"I SOUP ate a word, dog,”\n\n\"I soup ate a word, *DOG*,”\n\n\"I soup *ATE* a word, dog,”\n\n\"I *SOUP ATE* a word, *dog*,”\n\n\"*I soup* ATE a WORD, DOG,”\n\n\"I *SOUP ate A WORD*, dog,”\n\n\"*I* SOUP *ATE A WORD,* DOG,”\n\nThe last thing I recall was the child’s twilight face, and her sinister smile spreading impossibly wide across it, as she whispered.\n\n\"Welcome to the soup.\"\n\n\\-\n\nI woke up in a hospital room. Several weeks had passed since the day I’d driven to that house.\n\nThe doctors told me that I had been found wandering the streets, repeating the same words, over and over. They’d brought me back here to monitor my condition, and, upon my arrival, I’d collapsed from exhaustion and fell into a catatonic state. They had no medical explanation for my affliction.\n\nWhen I explained to them the circumstances that had brought me here, they agreed to arrange a meeting for me with the police. They came to visit me at my hospital bed and we discussed everything. The harassment, the investigation and the incident; taking care to leave out any details that might result in my institutionalisation. They too went away promising to uncover the truth, and they too were unable to find any leads on my attacker.\n\nIn fact, upon arriving at the supposed scene of the crime, the police found no house at all, construction had already begun on the development a few days prior. The house had been reduced to nothing, and the basement filled with concrete.\n\nI suppose no one else will ever truly know what happened to me, no one will ever truly understand what I went through, why I had to go through it or how it even happened.\n\nAs for myself, I've been left with only one reasonable explanation.\n\nI soup ate a word, dog,",

        "text": "Hey, Alen here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanna write this before I forget it again. I was Alan yesterday, I really was. My whole life I went to school studied and even have a college degree under the name of Ken. But who was Alen then?  Was I not Alan? Was I Ken? What Was I....No, Who Am I?\n\nI remember, the day I went to school and the teacher made me introduce myself on the first day and I clearly said, '*I am  Alan'*. But then when I try to think about it, a new memory shows up, it isn't my school teacher there, nor it is my first day of school instead I am standing in front of a group of boys, who are grabbing my collar and pushing me to the urinal...they are bullying me. I am weak and I even gave up the idea of even resisting, I am just keeping my eyes open to let it all sink in, and, then I see Ken hanging Alan up.\n\nI tried to enjoy my nights by going to my brother's house for drinks, but I don't know him, did I even have one? I tried to remember him as hard as I could but all I could see is a man, I can see his maroon shirt and khaki pants but his face...his face is black, it was like it was burned. I can hear his laugh, I can hear the music, I guess it's a party? But where are the others and who is this man? He calls me brother and every time he does that my heart aches, it races but I don't know this man...\n\nI woke up as Ken, but he wasn't sleeping, I guess he was standing how can he sleep when he is standing?  I got the exact feeling you get when you wake up, the sore throat, the body ache, the stiffness but when did I sleep? I am now standing in from of a group of students who are cheering...for Ken, I think, I am Ken. But there is this kid, in the back of the crowd I could see his figure but not his face, he was smiling but why can't I see above his lips? his eyes? his hair? Who is he?\n\n**\\[6 February 2012 | Monday | 1:23 AM\\]**\n\nI got a call, it was a woman's voice she was screaming but she was crying too. She screamed, *\"When will you come home Ken? It's been five years, now.\",* I woke up, but I wa-I was just standing in the hallway to pick up the phone, in my house but right now I am on the rooftop of a hotel and I am smoking a cigarette. I tried to regain control of this body but someone whispers behind my back, *\"Don't do it, Ken don't you dare to jump.\"* and I jumped...\n\n**\\[3 March 2012| Saturday | 10:49 AM\\]**\n\nI stopped looking at the mirror, every time I do I see a man with no face beating my face, but who is he holding? Is he Ken? Is he Alen? Am I Alen? Everywhere wherever I see a reflecting surface I can see my reflection the man beats me, and I decided once to look and he kept beating me, he broke my jaw, my teeth were hanging, my face was swollen, and my eyes vanished behind the skin of my face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[6 March 2010 | Tuesday | 3:12 AM\\]**\n\nKen is appearing more frequently now but where is Alen? If I am seeing Ken what am I? The lights are gone and I failed to pay the bill on time as it was in the name of Ken. I tried to remember Alen's origin but all I see are burnt-black faces, I tried to find Alen on Facebook, and Instagram, I even called the school I was in but the Alen never existed, instead they had a kid named Ken in there. It's been a few weeks since I am meeting a psychiatrist but yesterday something weird happened. I looked at his writing upside down and everywhere I told the name Alen he wrote Ken.\n\n**\\[20 February 2012 | Tuesday | 1:23 AM\\]**\n\nI don't remember when was the last time I was Alen, I killed Ken three days ago and so far I am sailing smoothly in life, I got a job, I went on a date, I even went cycling. I was happy after a long time. But then Ken came in suddenly and I was at my house and I had a knife in my hands and blood drops on my face, two policemen were laying on the stairs. I killed them, and Ken refuses to go now. I lost control of my body and all I can do is watch what he is doing behind those eyes which once belonged to Alen. \n\nBye\n\nKen",

        "text": "Cherelle was standing at my bedside in her navy nightgown with her arms crossed.\n\nCrossed in a pissed-off sort of way. Crossed like I just picked up the phone at the dinner table or crossed like I accidentally agreed that her friend Angela was cute again.\n\n“Shops closed tonight.” I groggily joked.\n\n“No, what? No, I don’t want what’s for sale.” She walloped my crotch with a rolled-up magazine from the nightstand.\n\n“Okay, okay,” I propped myself up against the headboard. “So, what’d I do?”\n\n“We’ve been living here for two years, Michael. Two years, and you haven’t thought to mention the room in the basement? What are you hiding from me down there, huh?”\n\n“Honey, you must have had a bad dream. Unless, of course, you’re referring to the laundry room…”\n\n“No, I’m not, honey,” She snarled. “You must have left the door open to this mystery room for the wind to catch because it woke me right up out of bed.”\n\nI squinted up at her, still dazed from counting sheep. “Okay, fine, you win. Show me.”\n\nFollowing my wife down our dimly lit hallway, I was convinced she was sleepwalking. I often played this same game with the kids, where you know something to be blatantly untrue, but suspend disbelief to keep the fun going. My youngest, Richie - he still thinks that I believe his account of seeing the Tooth Fairy. Otherwise known as, well, me.\n\nThinking of Rich, I peered my head into the crack of his bedroom door to half-check on him, half-check that he wasn’t the up-to-no-gooder making the racket in our basement. The streak of light from the hallway painted his drooling face. He growled a low snore, comatosed from his spaghetti bolognese nyquil.\n\nI creaked open a door further down the hall. Rose was there, check. Tommy was in his bedroom, too.\n\nCherelle turned around and snapped at me.\n\n“Come, MIchael.” She said, “I don’t want you thinking of any excuses before we make it downstairs and see this.”\n\n──────────────────────\n\nWe purchased our quaint little home the Fall before last. The house was at the end of the short cul-de-sac, backed against a small mountain that the native tribes had once named *Iich'aa*. It took me a couple chats with the folks living on my street to spell it, given how it was pronounced: *“Ee-chaw”*.\n\nBeing next to a mountain has given rise to a sort of anxiety I didn’t know I had - a nagging fear of people judging our home from a bird's eye view, hiking the hill and pointing and laughing at our clogged gutters or botched roof tile job. Though, Cherelle and I have agreed this lovely spot was otherwise perfect - a suburban paradise where we now raise our three children, so I suppose that outweighs the creeping anxiety.\n\nThe surrounding landscape: Beautiful, picturesque - as if living inside a desktop wallpaper. The neighbourhood was warm and lively, too. And well, when I say neighbourhood, I mean the five or six homes that circle the bud at the end of the cul-de-sac - everyone else down the line is a stranger to Cherelle and me.\n\nWe didn’t hear much about the people who lived in the home before us, except from old man Rodge, one of our neighbours, a couple of weeks after we moved in.\n\n“The couple before ya’ had their pick of problems.” He said one day as we were unloading groceries from the back of our SUV.\n\nI watched him for a while as he vacantly reminisced, staring up at our home through his thickly lensed glasses.\n\n“They were always having builders in, repairmen, busy vans and trucks - that sort of thing.” He shot over a wise look, one native to old men, the sort of face that carries a disguised worry that the world is going bad. “There’s been no such thing as peace the year that they were here, no sir-ree. Good folk, though, Tom was the man’s name.”\n\n“Well, we’re the quiet type, so don’t worry.” I said. “You have my word: No pedal to metal on the sportscar until I’m well around the corner.”\n\nCherelle giggled as she carried a bag into the house.\n\n“Did the couple end up settling down somewhere else? I can’t imagine that it was a problem with the neighbours or school. Hell, even the house is in pretty good knick. A little DIY to boot, but nothing that would make me or Chere’ want to move out.”\n\n“They went missing, the both of them.” He trailed off, before resuming his walk, cane in one hand and a dog leash in the other. “Cops think they went on a hunting trip ill-prepared, and the elements got ‘em. I say the husband dunnit, but it ain’t up to me to say.”\n\nI watched his wiry grey hair bob away and out of our street. Then my eyes shifted to my wife through our window, feeling glad she couldn’t hear our conversation.\n\nAnd that was the last I had heard of Rodge’ or the family that lived in our pretty white-picket fenced house before us.\n\nAt least, that was, until the night my wife brought me down to our basement.\n\n──────────────────────\n\n“I could have sworn it was right there,”\n\nMy wife had never looked so frantic, I was actually rather worried.\n\n“It, it was here,” She reassured herself. “Like a block of the floor had just… pried open like a trapdoor.”\n\nI stood by her for a while, away from the basement light so she could see properly. Cherelle was sprawled across the concrete floor of our basement, running her finger down cracks in the ground, looking for any sort of opening.\n\n“Must have been a nightmare, hun.” I said, pinching off a yawn, not to sound too dismissive.\n\n“Shush,” She said, rubbing something on the ground.\n\n“Oh, yes! Do you see this?” She shouted.\n\nI leaned over her shoulder to see what she was digging at. Her bleary eyes looked up at me as she showed off her fingerful of dust.\n\n“I vacuumed down here yesterday, and look!” She wiped the muck away from her index. “It’s from the room.”\n\n“Must have missed a spot.” I said.\n\n“Nope.” She snapped.\n\n“Why don’t you trust me?” I argued.\n\n“Because you’re not being honest.” She rebutted.\n\n“You’re not yourself, Cherelle.”\n\n“And you are hiding something.”\n\nWe both crawled back into bed later that night, defeated and without knowing. \n\nIf there’s one thing I hate about matrimony, it’s having to sleep next to the person you just argued with, for better or for worse. I mean, there’s always the couch, but our argumentative nights turn into civil war weeks if I pick that option. Besides, there’s a wide skylight in our living room so the people climbing Ii’chaa can see me drooling all over my pillow like a neanderthal. \n\nI hate that damn mountain.\n\n──────────────────────\n\nSaturday mornings are always a bit of a double-sided prick for me.\n\nEarly on, I take Tommy to soccer and bring some sliced fruit with me to cover our team's teeth with. Yeah, I’m the orange-slice guy. Kids love me, adults wish they were me. I have to say Tommy’s pretty good at sports, though he’s never scored a goal - I guess that’s because he’s always on the defence.\n\nLater on in the morning I drop Tommy back off home and then I’m in the city around ten, just in time for my appointment with Molly. I usually call her by her maiden name, Satan, but my wife just calls her by her job title, psychiatrist. Potato-po-ta-to.\n\n“You look rather unslept, Michael.” Satan was speaking to me from the corner of her small office, glaring at me from over the fake plants on the coffee table.\n\n“Had to wake up early and cut some fruit for my son’s game, you know how it is.” I said.\n\n“Doesn’t take that long,” She scribbled something down on paper. “Did it happen again last night?”\n\n“Ahh, here we go,” I stretched back in my chair - at least this part, the chair, felt like a hundred bucks an hour. “Her episode wasn’t that bad this time.”\n\n“What was she doing?”\n\n“Digging, I think. She woke me up at, say, midnight, and brought me down there again. But this time she was digging away at the concrete like a mad dog. Don’t think she remembered it by daylight, though. Don’t get me wrong, though, doc. She’s not alone in this delirium – sometimes I think I hear a woman sobbing down there, too.”\n\n“Folie à deux – shared psychosis. How do her episodes make you feel?”\n\n*These guys make a living off that question.*\n\n“I hate seeing her like that, Molly, I do.” I said.\n\nSatan pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and wrote something else down. “Michael, I asked how it made you feel.”\n\n“Sad,” I said. \n\n*Sometimes I wish these shrinks would break character, act a little unprofessional - it would spice up the hours that I spend sitting in chair-jail.*\n\n“Sad? Just… ‘Sad’? Really pulling the big-boy words out from the wrinkles of your brain aren’t ya, Mikey?” I imagined Molly saying, passive-aggressively.\n\nBut no, she just sat there all studious-like, waiting for me to trickle more meagre words out.\n\n“Sad but… also scared.” I said as if I was a goddamn toddler. “Like, when I’m looking at Cherelle, I’m looking at somebody sleepwalking, knowing it's not them. Yeah, sometimes I’m scared.”\n\n“Well, maybe she is sleepwalking.”\n\n“Shouldn’t you have her in this damn chair instead, then?” I blurted out. “Why the hell am I here?”\n\nThere was a palpable silence in the shrink’s office, save for the big, round clock that kept on tick-tick-ticking.\n\nShe cleared her throat after a while. “Well, Michael,”\n\nI could see her perching her lips - loading her verbal-gun - the next bullet to put me down like some sort of quick-witted cowboy dropping a one-liner in a western flick.\n\n“Because it was your daughter that died, too.”\n\nBullet? No. Try a thousand-tonne anchor made of her familiar words dragging me back down to Earth in crashing flames.\n\nI like to think it’s the little things that lift me up. Listening to my favourite records in the coupe. Taking Tommy to soccer. Eating a steak that is perfectly medium rare and seared on the outside.\n\nBut leave it up to none other than doctor Satan every Saturday morning to bring me back down to hell. Back to the night when Amy went missing and never came home.\n\n“Died? My daughter is missing, not dead.” I said.\n\n“You’ve started referring to her in the past tense these last couple of months, Mike. Sorry, I thought you knew.”\n\n“Oh,”\n\n*Tick. Tick. Tick.*\n\n“Your wife doesn’t think that way. She has hope. And, well, this hope - maybe she thinks Amy is somehow alive below the basement, Michael. At least, in a fantasy.” She scribbled. “But it will heal in time. You both will. We grieve differently. But I think in the meantime, just play along - she’s coping. One day, you’ll wake up and not think of your daughter. Cherelle’s nightmares will fade, so will the pain.”\n\nI grabbed a tissue from the coffee table and went for the door, my wet eye catching that there were still many minutes left on the clock.\n\n“Michael-” She started.\n\n“Thanks for the session. See you next week Molly.”\n\n──────────────────────\n\nSometimes I take the long way home.\n\nMolly says it’s unhealthy - an avoidance of feelings I need to confront. That I’m afraid of the Saturday quiet, sitting around the house doing nothing on the weekend and letting the thoughts creep in.\n\nI suppose in a way that it is a bit childish, the long route home that is. The adult equivalent of meandering through high school corridors on the way to detention or chatting away incessantly to the dentist just so he can’t stick his metal tools in your mouth.\n\n\nDetention, dentist: Temporary misery for long term improvement. And I guess going home and chatting with my wife on Saturdays is good for me in the end too.\n\nBut when I’m in my coupe, I am free. I listen to the rise and settle of each gear under the bonnet. \n\nAnd only the back streets let me reach sixth.\n\nThis is what men refer to as ‘healing’.\n\nFunny ain’t it? \n\n──────────────────────\n\n\nI rolled up to my driveway sometime after noon and put the car into park.\n\nSure, I miss working from home, but returning to the office has given me a newfound appreciation for the weekend. When you’re working from home, everything turns blurry in your periphery when you see it a thousand times a day. Observing things around you, but not, like streetlamps flying by a speeding car. But on the weekend, I breathe in every detail. I savour each and every moment that I’m away from the fax machine.\n\nI began taking notice of what birds were making a home out of our gutter, all the plants my wife had been putting into the garden, the wide dent in the back of her car that was shaped like a small animal. When I used the bathroom, I noticed that Tommy had scribbled a small sheet of paper and taped it to the door, brilliantly labelled: TOIYET. Appreciating all the things I would have otherwise been blind to if I was stuck at home for another month.\n\nI shut the door to the bathroom on my way out, thinking about how Tommy’s handwriting had gone from looking like abstract art to the font from a heavy metal band.\n\n“We need to talk.” Said my wife, staring at me down the hallway.\n\nUh oh.\n\n“But I just did the whole talking thing…” I replied, defeated.\n\nShe curled a finger and led me into the kitchen.\n\n“Where’s the ice cream gone?” She asked.\n\n“I hope you’re not accusing me instead of one of our children, darling.”\n\nShe hissed out some air. “If Tommy ate it I’d definitely see some evidence. This, this here,”\n\nCherelle popped open the container of ice cream, exposing the colossal crater within. “This is the work of a criminal mastermind.”\n\n“Chere, hand to god,” I raised a few fingers. “Wasn’t me.”\n\nTommy turned his head around at the sound of ice cream like that one scene out of the Exorcist.\n\n“Can I finish it?” He said, only barely managing to peel his eyes free off Spongebob, flopping his arms over the couch back.\n\n“Did you finish your homework?” I pressed.\n\n“Not yet, but I-”\n\n“Ah-ah-ah.” Cherelle took charge. “After the assignment.”\n\n“But, but,” Tom started. “It’s not fair! How come Amy gets to eat it all and I don’t get any?”\n\nSilence.\n\nCherelle and I exchanged glances.\n\nWe grieve differently. Molly’s words glowed in my mind like a hot iron.\n\nThen, after a while, the silence was gone. There was no more talk of his missing sister. \n\nWith no ice cream to go around, Tommy turned around, the sponge giggling from the television.\n\n──────────────────────\n\nIt must have been four, five when I woke up early Sunday morning.\n\nI remained on my side, watching the bare fingers of the branches outside dance in the wind and scrape against the windowpane.\n\nIf I sat still, I could hear a deeper skittering, one not coming from the glass. One echoing from deeper in the house, like somebody moving furniture.\n\nMy wife lay flat, too, breathing with the heaviness of being fast asleep.\n\nI slinked out of our duvet with a gracefulness figure skaters can only aspire for, one reserved for husbands tiptoeing out of bed to pee.\n\nMy body drew cold when I turned around.\n\nShe was watching me from the bed with wide, billiard-ball eyes. \n\nGoogly eyes, like they were stuck onto her eyelids – open, but not quite seeing.\n\n“Honey?” I whispered.\n\nNo response, only a low, terrifying moan that fell out of her open mouth.\n\nMy feeling of alarm fell to the wayside when I realised that she was having one of her sleepwalking episodes, just without the walking.\n\nI shook myself right and pressed on.\n\nLuckily, the first set of stairs paved my way without so much as a creak. Though, when I reached the second set leading to the basement, my body felt heavy, it was difficult to push forward. It was as if some inkling of intuition stirred within me, some part of me wanted to pull away.\n\nI thought hard for a while; my hand around the cold door handle, unwilling to turn. And then thoughts of my wife finally came, and so did the knowing that it was finally time to put her grievances and delusions to rest.\n\nDescending the basement, I noticed my gracefulness had gone away, replaced by an apparent jitteriness, fuelled by a fear of the dark that had been long lost.\n\nI pressed the basement light switch, and it flickered on in several cold strobes.\n\nVisually, the room was the same as it always was. Vacant, musty, void of colour or decoration. But most curiously, the floor beckoned inspection. Something about it was magnetic, as if it had miraculously become the centrepiece overnight.\n\nOnce at the bottom of the stairs, I noticed that there was a muffled hum that overtook the silence. It sounded like the low throb of a car driving past the suburb with a throbbing base-tone.\n\nI kneeled to take a closer look for dust, and to listen to the sound coming from the floor.\n\nMy wife was right, it was dusty. But nothing that couldn’t have just been dislodged from the ceiling.\n\nA disheartening rumbling filled the air, and my heart leaped into my throat. Kneeling on the floor had managed to apply enough pressure to crack the square in the floor open like a trapdoor.\n\nIt sounded like the ground was about to collapse. As I shifted around, the quiet crumbling of rock seemed to come from beneath the concrete.\n\nEventually the floor pried open on a hinge enough to see into. Below was no basement, and barely a room - rather, it was a small passageway containing a long ladder to another trapdoor below.\n\nI blew away the clouds of unsettled dust and rock which had coated my tongue and throat in an earthy taste. Before climbing into the hole, I grabbed a small torch from a drawer of the workbench. Pinching it between my teeth, I descended the shoddy ladder with both my hands.\n\nPaternal hope is a senseless thing. The closer I got to the trapdoor below my feet, the more the flame of hope emboldened. With it burned any doubts in my mind. It didn’t matter that deep down I knew she had no access to food, no clean water for months. At least for that fleeting moment, she had to be alive. She had to be down-\n\nGales sucked through the open-door hole like a torn plane.\n\nMy foot stung from kicking the door with my heel; the space below me was an empty void as I hung from a rudder. The only sound was that of rushing wind and water below, save for the occasional groaning from the hinge of the broken trapdoor.\n\nWhen my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my eyes set upon a sight like no other.\n\nA great gushing waterfall cascaded from one tall wall. The wall itself was coated with a black mould or vegetation that was barely discernible in the dying cone of my torch. Rays of the basement light trickled in through the ladder, leaving shadowed striations by the hissing mist of the crashing water some fifty feet below.\n\nAs easily as I had come down the ladder, I went straight up after realising what I needed to do next.\n\nI ripped open drawers of the basement, looking for anything that would help me down to the bottom of the cave, or at least to get Amy up to the house.\n\nShe had to be down below. She had to be.\n\nSpanners and nails went flying as I tore open cabinets. Knowing the flashlight was dying, I pulled a wrench from the rack off the wall and wrapped the top up in an oiled cloth. I also pulled out a rope that was bracing a kayak up against the wall, tying it to my waist as I returned to the hole in the ground.\n\nBack down the rudders I went, each metallic step echoing into the chamber below. I fell to a rocky outthrust just beneath the ladder. It served as a cliff of sorts overlooking the massive ravine, where the basement light couldn’t quite reach the bottom but would provide enough light to sort myself out before heading down.\n\n“Amy?” I screamed out. No sound ever came back, only that of my voice bouncing between the cavern walls in the dark.\n\nAfter one of the ends of the ropes was securely fashioned around a protruding rock, I let the rest of it fly down to the ground below.\n\nLeaning over the cliff with nothing but my rope to guide me down, I felt terrified - I hadn’t been climbing for a decade.\n\nI took a deep breath, faced my back to the blackness which seemed to go unending, and began my descent.\n\n──────────────────────\n\nIt was colder at the bottom of the ravine. Lighting the oiled cloth on my wrench with the zippo in my pocket provided me with a torch and some warmth, but it didn’t stop the claustrophobic emptiness that seemed to close in at every turn.\n\nI began walking to my right, always sticking to the wall. That way, I knew I wouldn’t get lost.\n\n“Amy?” I called out.\n\nMore and more gnats seemed to fly around my light source as I kept walking forward.\n\nThe amber light of the torch caught something in the dark. Not exactly an uneven rock formation or limestone, but something pale.\n\nAnd it was coming for me.\n\nI screamed and turned tail. The steps behind me seemed to grow louder as I ran, and I wasn’t so sure that I could make it back to the rope in time.\n\nHands wrapped around me and turned me to my side, and in that moment the woman in the dark filled my vision with her ghastly stare.\n\n“Oh my God, Tom, someone has come for us,” She screamed.\n\nWords couldn’t trickle out just yet, I was busy trying to wrestle free from her grip. When I did, I swung the torch in front of her.\n\nShe was a pale, bony woman with scraggly clothing that had not been changed in weeks, months.\n\n“Put the torch out,” She whispered, as if not wanting to be heard. “Please put it out,”\n\nFrom my periphery, I saw a man enter the ring of light emanating from my torch. He too was starved and unkempt. The two of them were holding up their hands submissively; their fingernails long and encrusted with grime.\n\n“Who- who are you?!” I demanded.\n\n“You have to put it out, please,” The man said, his voice as if a snake was trying to speak. “And please keep your voice down.”\n\nI stood my ground, not letting the couple get any closer. Their ghastly faces stared at me unblinkingly like they had not seen a person, let alone light in a long time.\n\n“My daughter,” I started, always walking backward to the safety of my rope. “Have you seen her, Amy, is she down here?”\n\nThe woman’s eyes shifted my mine, then the torch, then back to my face. I could tell that she was going to launch at me soon, at any cost to extinguish my flame.\n\n“Y-yes, we’ve seen the girl.”\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“I’m Tom, and-and this is my wife, Jeanette Mosely, we live at the house up above. We thought nobody was ever going to come for us, we thought-”\n\n“You mustn’t speak so loudly,” She interrupted her husband.\n\n“What’s going on? Where is my daughter?”\n\nI watched the woman’s long, pencil-like finger point at the bleak nothingness of the cave. “The-There’s something down here,” She whispered before leaning in closer. “Something that wears human faces,”\n\n“But, but it’s not human - it’s,” Whispered the man, his expression wide-eyed and hopeless.\n\nThere was a different feeling to the gloom surrounding us then, as if the walls were closing in, as if we were being watched.\n\n“If you don’t put out the torch it’s going to find us, it’s going, oh my God,” She warned before her eyes lit up. “THERE’S A ROPE!”\n\nThe man dove at her and wrapped his fingers around her lips so she couldn’t make a noise.\n\nBut it was too late, her whimpers told me that it was, and at that moment I knew she decided to make a run for an escape.\n\nShe elbowed me in the cheek as she wrestled her husband away from her, sprinting past me and up to the cliff face.\n\nJeanette latched onto the rope and kicked her way up as far as she could.\n\nHer arms were frail, and I wasn’t sure if she could make it the whole way. It was clear the couple hadn’t eaten in weeks, their muscle eating away at itself trying to refuel their bodies.\n\nBy around halfway up the cliff Tom and I held the same look on our faces, staring up in terror at the woman climbing as if watching a plane explode in the sky.\n\nI’m not exactly sure what made the woman let go of the rope. It might have been the thing in the darkness, or the beads of sweat between her frail, shaking fingers.\n\nBut when she fell, her skull against the rock sounded like a fish being dropped into an empty sink.\n\n“Oh God,” Tom screamed. “Oh my God Jen, no, no, no, no,” He chanted as he kneeled.\n\nI felt sick to my stomach when I backed over the tiny red rivers that were forming between the rocks.\n\n“No, no, no, no,”\n\nThe fluid from the cavity in her head soaked up into Tom’s jeans, and he screamed. When he did, something deeper in the cave did, too.\n\nThere was a sound of something shifting in the blackness, not wanting to be heard.\n\nI made my way to the rope as fast as I could, my heartbeat pounding my chest. Before I did, I tried to tug Tom away from his wife.\n\nWhat was left of her jaw sat open wide, something that reminded me again of a fish. My stomach churned with that thought, and I tugged him so hard he almost fell flat on his face as he stood up.\n\n“We need to go,” I yelled. “I don’t know if you can make it all the way, so I’m going to go up first and pull you,”\n\nHis hand left maroon-coloured fingerprints as he held his head, but I knew he was nodding. “It’s going to come for me, it’s-”\n\n“No, I’m going to pull you, Tom, okay?” I repeated as I gripped the rope, extinguished the flame and began climbing. \n\nIt was a lot more difficult to climb up than descend, each rock that my foot landed on seemed to me laden with a slimy growth.\n\nWhen I was partially up, I managed to throw the extinguished torch up onto the platform. At the height, I could no longer see the man below me, but I knew that he was there because he was tensing the line.\n\nOnce at the top, the cool basement light that streamed through the ceiling put all the stains on my clothing on visceral display.\n\n“Tom, grab the rope now, I’ll pull you up.”\n\nI readied my hands around the line, noticing abrasions from sliding down earlier.\n\n“Ready when you are.”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Tom?”\n\nStill no reply.\n\nI was leaning over the side of the rock, sliding on my belly to not fall. From there, I lit my torch with the lighter.\n\nThat’s when her voice toppled me like a vase.\n\n“Daddy?”\n\nI launched to my feet, swiping the empty air with the flaming torch, trying to see anything, anything at all - but it was too far to the ground for the light to reach.\n\n“Come get me, please, I’m scared.” The voice pouted from below.\n\n“Amy?” I muttered, staring at the nothingness over the cliffs edge.\n\nThere was a terrifying delay before she spoke again.\n\n“Yes, it’s me, come get me I’m scared.”\n\nI waited a while. The torch in my hand seemed to whoosh as I swung it from left to right as I was trying to get an angle on the bottom of the ravine.\n\nAfter a while the silence returned, save for the occasional wind running through my flame.\n\nI wanted to reply. I wanted to call her name and climb down there and give her all the big hugs she had missed out on and tell her what a brave girl she was.\n\nIt chilled my bones to hear her once again. In the depths of the frigid ravine, I could only tell that I was crying when the tears finally journeyed from my numb cheek and wet my shirt.\n\nAnd I wanted to descend, I almost did, but I knew that the voice in the dark was only something pretending to be my daughter.\n\nI noticed the cuts and grazes which adorned my arms as I climbed the ladder back to the familiar basement light.\n\nOnce above ground, I heaved the weighty concrete slab back into place and closed the hole.\n\nAmy’s face glowed in my mind like hot iron. I’d be back for her.\n\nI was going to return.\n\nThe couple said that they had seen her. She was down there somewhere in the inky abyss, cold and afraid.\n\nAnd she wasn’t [alone]( https://www.reddit.com/r/sharpshooting/comments/10gx0wz/new_series_the_moth/).",

        "text": "I was sitting on the balcony looking through my binoculars when I heard my roommate come home from work. \n\n“Aaron?” I yelled through the screen door. I waited a moment. The silence began to panic me the longer it pressed on. I put the lens caps on and set down the ‘nocs and quickly jotted something in my notebook.\n\n“…Aaron…?” I called out a little quieter now, just beginning to rise to my feet. \n\n“Yo.” He says as he slides the screen door open and steps out on the balcony with me. He pulls out a spliff and lights it in the shelter of his palm before plopping down in the chair beside me. \n\n“How was work?” I asked, while removing the caps off the binoculars again. \n\n“Same shit, different day. How’s the job hunt?” he asked as he exhalated a bitter cloud. Maybe the cloud wasn’t bitter. Maybe it’s just me. \n\n“Fuck I hate that question. It’s fine. Look at this.” I passed the binoculars to him and pointed at the horizon. His joint dangled off his lip while he peered through. \n\n“What am I supposed to be seeing?” he asked before the cherry at the end of his smoke lit up and smoke slowly rose from the corners of his mouth.\n\n“The fog! It’s sunny here, but all foggy near the horizon. Why is it always foggy out there?” I snatched his joint and took a long draw to try calm my nerves.\n\n“So…? It’s just fog.” He handed the ‘nocs to me and took his smoke back. \n\nI looked through again. “Yesterday and the day before… can you remember it NOT being foggy in the distance?”.\n\n“I’m sure it’s just been lately. It doesn’t mean anything. Don’t read into shit. No offense man, but you’re getting all neurotic from being cooped up at home so much lately.” He said, with what I believe to be genuine concern for my well-being. \n\n“Let’s get some rotis” Aaron said as he snuffed the butt on the leg of the chair and rose to his feet. \n\n“Okay sure.” I capped the lenses again.\n\n\\-\n\nThe fresh air did calm me a little, I guess. Aaron was inside ordering for us while I lingered by the entrance on the sidewalk. Arms crossed and staring like a weirdo at the people waiting at the bus stop on the other side of the road. I must have looked like a tweaker for sure, since I don’t think I was blinking much at all. \n\n“Here.” A voice said, and I must have jumped out of my skin for a second. \n\n“Jesus, calm down. Here.” Aaron handed me my shawarma and said “You can pay me back when you land something, don’t worry. I’ve been there.”\n\n“I thought it was rotis?” I said, opening the wrapping.\n\n“What?” He replied, opening his as well.\n\n“Nevermind.” I muttered. \n\n“What were you staring at?” he asked and took a big bite of his food and looked towards the bus stop people.\n\n“Those people there waiting, I think two of them have synced up.” I said, not taking a bite yet - fixated on the people. \n\n“Synced up?” He laughed with his mouth full.\n\n“I’m not joking, just watch. In a couple seconds they’ll take a sip of their coffee. I think their… loop like, happened to sync up.” I said, and we both paused for a moment to watch. Two of the five people waiting for the bus took a sip of coffee at the same time.\n\n“There! See!” I gestured frantically with my shawarma hand, flinging bits onto the sidewalk.\n\n“That two people drank coffee? Three of those people have a cup in their hand. So chances are pretty high that they’d happen to take a sip at the same time.” Aaron says with what I believe to be, mild sass. \n\n“No, man. Look! They shift their weight to the other leg at the same time, turn their heads a little… just watch!” I said, probably squeezing the shawarma a little too tight.\n\n“Do you hear yourself? Jesus. Come on.” He said as he began walking in the direction of a park that we saw on our way here. We ended up passing closer by the bus stop people on our way, and I don’t know when it happened… but the two people were no longer in sync. \n\nWe sat on a bench with a nice view of the park. An elderly couple pass by while I dig into my food. For a little while we just eat in silence and enjoy each others company. Aaron has been my friend since high school, so he has a lot of patience for me, but I think I’ve been annoying him lately. \n\nI look up through the leaves at the beams of sunshine. “Why is it always sunny?” I say with my mouth full. \n\n“Now you’re going to complain about pleasant weather?” he said, a little exasperated with my bullshit. \n\n“No, I just mean, it’s never like… overcast or rainy, it’s just always a… nice day” I muttered, maybe hearing a little of how stupid this sounds. \n\n“Dude, I think it rained like a week or two ago.” he said.\n\n“It didn’t.” I said firmly, averting my eyes. Eye contact was always kind of difficult for me, but right now I just know he’s making a face like I’m a hopeless nutjob and I can’t bear to see it. After a few quiet moments, he stands up.\n\n“Look, I gotta grab more weed. Wanna come to the head shop with me before we go back?” he says, zipping up his jacket the rest of the way. I followed along, hunching against the chilly wind.\n\n“I know I sound crazy, but I’ve been taking notes lately to keep it all straight, and I’m starting to see weird patterns.” I pulled out my small notebook and turned through to one of the middle pages while speeding my walk to catch up with him.\n\n“I’ll bite, okay? What patterns?” he says, politely entertaining me as we approach the door.\n\n“Okay here, before we head in, look at this.” I pointed at my notebook. “The staff will say only one of three responses to the transaction, and nothing else. Unless, of course, prompted.”\n\n“Of course.” he says sarcastically before reading:\n\n3 CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSES\n\n“Thank you, have a great day.”\n\n“Thanks, take care.”\n\n“Cheers, have a good one.”\n\nAaron looks from the notes to me, in disbelief. “These are very normal things to say, man. You’re reeeally reading way too into shit.”\n\n“Ugh! Come on.” I open the door to the shop and he goes in first. I follow and put my hands in my pockets, anxiously tapping my thumb on my hip. I always keep my hands in my pockets in stores because I’m scared that they’ll think I’m stealing or something. Aaron picks out a half-ounce and pays at the register. The girl smiles and says “Thanks, take care.” and my eyes bug out at Aaron. He doesn’t seem surprised and just casually heads for the door. \n\n“See!?” I whisper-yell as we leave. “She said the thing! I told you, only one of the three things!” \n\nAaron sighed dramatically and said that it was a normal thing for her to say, and that there’s only so many things customer service can say to you when you leave. I don’t think he gets it. I don’t know why it’s so important to me that he gets it. I guess if he believes me, and understands, then I won’t feel so crazy… or something. I don’t know. I’ll apply for some jobs tomorrow. \n\n\\-\n\nI slept in, again, so Aaron has already long since left for work. The weirdest thing happened. It rained. I honestly gasped when I woke up and heard it. I ran to the balcony and there it was! Rain! I was going to look at job ads, but I couldn’t help myself. I sat out on the balcony again, binoculars in hands, just… watching people. Time flies when you’re being a fuckin’ creep I guess, because Aaron was home again before I knew it. He set his umbrella leaning against the chair on the balcony to dry.\n\n“Yo.” He plopped down in the chair next to me and started fiddling with his grinder.\n\nI raise the binoculars again. “Okay so, hear me out. But there are only five different kinds of dogs.”\n\n“What the fuck are you even on about?” he said.\n\n“LOOK! There are only five fucking dogs, they’re all just… repeats of those dogs. There are no other dogs Aaron, just the five! I took pictures this time, so you can’t say I’m making it up!” I thrusted my phone into his hands and swiped again and again.\n\n“Jack Russel, see the red collar? Golden, Poodle, Black Labrador, Chihuahua … another Jack Russel, with the same red collar! Golden, Chihuahua… It’s just the same ones, over and over. There are no others!” I said, probably hysterically. “If there are only fives kinds of dogs ever around, and only the three customer service responses… maybe there’s a pattern? Like these numbers maybe mean something?” I pleaded for him to understand. He just shoved the phone back into my hands. \n\n“You seriously need to get a fucking job, I can’t pay for all this shit on my own. You’re losing your fuckin’\n\nmarbles. I don’t know what to tell you, dude. Like, look in front of you. It’s raining. And just yesterday you were bitching about how it never rained. Are you going to reconsider, or is this somehow further proof of some crazy conspiracy?” he said, shaking his head while rolling a joint and licking the papers to seal it. \n\nI was pissed. Conspiracy?! Like I’m some ‘jet fuel can’t melt steel beams’ wacko. This is real! Or rather, it isn’t. Something is fucky and I am done hearing him doubt all my proof at every turn. I stood up and yelled. “It only rained after I talk to YOU about how it never rained. You don’t even own an umbrella! Where the fuck did the umbrella come from, Aaron!?”.\n\nHe furrowed his brow at me. He probably would have stood up too if he didn’t have his rolling tray on his lap.\n\n“Maybe I bought one while I was out!” he yelled back.\n\n“Maybe?! Did you, or didn’t you? Do you even know? Where do you even go during the day? Where do you even work?!” I threw my hand up in a vague gesture to the city. \n\n“You know what? I’ve put up with your shit long enough, I’m not going to carry your ass through life. You’re out by the end of the month, I’m fucking done with this shit.” He lit up his joint and wouldn’t even look at me. \n\nI know I’m getting close to something. I feel it in my bones. I left the apartment and slammed the door on my way out. Fuck Aaron, he doesn’t see the patterns right in front of his face. Everything seems to get more… complex as I get closer, and simpler when further away. It’s like the detail of… reality follows me. That must be it! I got in my car and started driving toward the highway. I’ve been out of the city before, but what if…\n\nAs I merged onto the highway, I slowly began putting the pedal to the floor. The engine roared and geared up, and the little needle on the speed indicator slowly leaned further and further to the right. Cars I passed whizzed by. The houses whizzed by. Bicyclists on the shoulder whizzed by. As I started to reach top speed, the highway felt more open. Fewer cars were on the road. My toes felt numb with how hard I was pushing the pedal down. I’m so close to something. A distinct lonely feeling started to set in, and I realized that there were fewer houses, and more rolling green hills. I was fixated on the hills, as they were so bare. It’s like a default Windows wallpaper. I look around both sides and confirm that there are no other cars on the road, no pedestrians on bikes. No trees. No houses to whizz by. I lean in and squint at the rolling hills and it feels like… there are no grass blades. It’s just green…dirt. I fucking did it. I was right. Holy shit I was right. I pull my foot up to release some pressure on the gas and the engine quiets just a little. As I slow down, I can make out grass blades now. A farm house is on the hill, and even has some trees on the property. Despite not further accelerating, the car was still flying down the road pretty fast, fast enough to wrap almost entirely around a tree that seemed to appear out of nowhere. I guess I’ve veered onto the shoulder of the highway a bit more than I thought. I can hear birds. And cars. Cars pulling over and I hear someone shouting to call 911. A crowd forms around the wreckage of my car as my vision fades. I swear that tree wasn’t there a moment ago.",

        "text": "It's not often we get calls from the trailerpark at the station. When there are reports, it's usually ábout them, and not the other way around. They don't trust us very much, which I understand, we don't trust them either. In fact, it's well known some of the inhabitants of the park engage in several criminal activities. However, as a policeman, I always try to view people as people, even the outcasts. Especially the outcasts. So, when one of them rang us on a payphone about three newborn infants going missing in the past three days, I volunteered to check it out along with some other officers.  \n\nKids in this place are what you could call 'raised by the community', which means everyone looks out for eachother and the parents trust their neighbours with watching their kids when it is necessary. Really quite communal and friendly when compared to the individualistic society most others call home in the big city. Here it did not work in their favour however, all infants went missing during a lapse in attention by a parent of other supervisor. My colleagues continued to investigate the camp itself, while I took the police vehicle and drove slowly with an open window to scour the surroundings.\n\nThe camp was situated close to a dike next to a broad river, where huge freighters went from the mainland towards the harbours at the rivermouth. About a mile or two from the camp was a high overpass, above which cars raced towards the city centre. During rush hour, you could hear the horns and smell the exhaust fumes all the way below. Beyond the overpass the road continued along the dike, and on the left side a thick patch of green reeds grew. This spot would flood a little during the rainier parts of the year, a great place for getting lost, or Hiding. It's there that I heard the crying.\n\nClear as day, the small wails of an infant echoed through the reeds, as if the stalks themselves where being lashed by the wind. I exited the vehicle and slowly made my way through the reeds, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. The child was clearly close to the ground, so determining the exact direction was difficult, especially between the rustling. After a while I noticed another soft sound, a very suble crunching. It was nearly indistinguishable from the reeds, but as I got close it became more clear. Soon, that all ceased mattering.\n\n'Hey! You!' Someone shouted suddnely.  'This, is Poopsablood!'  \nSuddenly from my right, a huge figure emerged from the reeds. That figure is permanently burned on the inside of my eyelids. It was human, clearly human, but what a terrible specimen. She was fat, so much so that she seemed just on the edge of being able to walk. She had short straw coloured hair, and her voice sounded like a man's, probably due to years of smoking and other substance abuse. Her skin was full of scabs, and her teeth were sharpened from decay and gnawing hard foods. Her mouth was covered with dried blood, mixed with either dirt, dung or both. To my absolute horror, I saw that in her hand she held the body of one of the newborns. The bottom half she had already devoured, and the upper torso she flailed around horribly while she screamed at me.\n\n'This is Poopsablood! It was made from above! For you! Not me!' She stared intently at me as she screamed this, and she walked towards me in a surprisingly quick pace for her size. I guess the reeds are no longer an issue when you're that heavy. It was at this point i noticed I had left my service weapon in the car. I cursed under my breath while slowly walking backwards, trying to maintain eye contact. I was not going to be able to arrest this person on my own, I needed backup, and she walked too fast for my liking. In the background the quiet wailing affirmed at least one of the infants was still alive.\n\n'Say it with me!', she screamed hoarsely. 'This is Poopsablood! It was made from above, for you! Not me!'\n\nI obliged, hoping that it would calm her down. 'This is Poopsablood' i shouted along with her.   \n'Made from above!'   \n'made from above'\n\n'For You!'  \n'for me'\n\n'Not me!'  \n'not you'\n\nSeeing the corpse flabbing with every syllable made me absolutely sick, but I stuck to this tactic untill I was close enough to reach for the door handle of the police vehicle. The moment i turned to open the door, I fell to the ground hard. In a split second she had caught up the 10 feet distance, and with her free arm she pulled my right leg from under me. I managed turn around quickly enough to watch her sink her disgusting rotted teeth into my shoulder. \n\nBlast that hurts! No time to think. I punched her on the nose. Hard.   \n'Ow! Fuck you!', she shouted while she recoiled. This was just enough time for me to kick free, get in the car and grab my weapon and radio. I thought I was good, but with some unnatural brute strength she tore the door straight off the vehicle and dragged me out. I gasped as I peered into her gaping black mouth, now pried open to inhuman dimensions like a chasm. Then, I shot her...\n\nWhat happened after I only remember vaguely. Perhaps due to blood loss, perhaps because I wish I could erase these memories from my brain. After radioing for backup, and an ambulance, I passed out. I woke up in the hospital, my veins flooded with fresh blood and antibiotics. The woman was dead, and her stomach contents revealed the remains of two infants. The third was apparently rescued alive from the reeds, and returned to a gratefull mother and father. How that woman became this way nobody knows for certain, nor where she came from. There were no drugs found in her body, only traces of past substance abuse. Perhaps it was a sort of rabies, or mad cow disease. The teeth marks on my shoulder did not correspond to the dimensions of the human jaw, the doctors said it looked more like that of a wild ape. The only reason i'm alive is because not one but two ambulances came along after my call, one for the child and one for me. I dare not image the terrible infections I would otherwise have suffered. \n\nI'm getting a desk job, soon as i'm able to sleep again.",

        "text": "It was the middle of the night, and I was lying in bed, wide awake. The darkness was oppressive and crushing. I had left my window open, letting the night air rush in, but the only sound that it brought was that of a lone cricket chirping in the distance, like a distant beacon of light in the ever-darkening night.  \n\nMy mind was racing. Every creak and every rustle of a leaf made me jump, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. I was alone in the house and fear was gripping my entire being. I felt like I was in the middle of some vast, unknown void, and it was all too unsettling.  \n\nI got up and opened my bedroom door, peering out into the darkness. Nothing. I listened intently, but all I could hear was the eerie silence of the night. As I stood there, I wondered what unseen creatures lurked in the shadows, their eyes searching for me through the night. I trembled, my body trembling with apprehension.  \n\nI made my way down the stairs, my feet creaking on each step. I paused at the bottom, my eyes scanning the living room. Nothing there either. I tiptoed across the room, my entire body shaking with fear. I could feel something watching me from the shadows, but I dared not look.  \n\nReaching the kitchen, I quickly grabbed a flashlight from one of the drawers. I switched it on, my heart beating faster as the light filled the room. I ran outside, the cold night air hitting my face like a slap. I shone the light around the backyard, but I couldn't see anything. I took a few steps forward, then stopped. I heard a loud thud coming from behind me.  \n\nI spun around quickly, my flashlight focused on a large, black shape. It was a large black bear, standing just a few feet away from me. I gasped, my heart pounding in my chest. The bear stared at me with its large, dark eyes, and I could swear that it was smiling. Its presence unnerved me, and I slowly started backing away. The bear followed me with its gaze, not breaking eye contact as I stumbled back into the house, my body shaking with fear.  \n\nOnce back inside, I locked the door and raced up the stairs. I tucked myself back into bed, pulling the covers up over my head and closing my eyes. I lay there for a long time, my heart racing as I thought about the strange events of the night. What had that bear been doing there? What other creatures lurked outside in the darkness?  \n\nFinally, I drifted off to sleep, my fear slowly fading away into the darkness. I awoke the next morning, my body heavy with the unsettling feelings of the night before. I recalled the events in the dark of night, but the fear was gone. I made my way to my grandfather's house, my mind still reeling from the events of the previous night. I walked through the door and found him sitting in his rocking chair, staring out the window. I approached him, and he turned to look at me, his eyes squinting with curiosity.\n\n\"Grandpa,\" I said, my voice shaking slightly, \"I need to show you something.\" I led him out to the backyard, and there in the dirt were the large footprints. He leaned in for a closer look, his hand reaching out to touch the edge of one of the prints. He was silent for a moment, his mind seemingly lost in thought.\n\n\"Those aren't the tracks of a bear, my boy,\" he said, finally breaking the silence, \"Those are the tracks of a bigfoot.\"\n\nI was stunned, I had never heard of such a creature before. My grandfather then proceeded to tell me about the local legend of the bigfoot, a creature said to roam these woods for centuries. He spoke in a slow, measured voice, his eyes never leaving mine. He told me stories of people who have encountered the creature and never returned, of strange noises in the night, and of eerie sightings deep in the woods.\n\nAs he spoke, I could feel a sense of unease growing in the pit of my stomach. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The thought of a creature like that roaming the woods around my home was terrifying. My grandfather could see the fear on my face and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said, \"These woods have been home to many creatures for centuries, some known and some unknown. But as long as you respect their territory, they will do the same.\"\n\nI nodded, my mind still trying to process everything I had just heard. I knew that the memory of that night and the feeling of being watched would stay with me forever, but I also knew that I couldn't let it consume me with fear. I would have to learn to live with the unknown and the unsettling feelings that came with it.",

        "text": "My fiancé went missing 7 months ago. Everyone thinks I’m crazy for thinking that he’s still out there, that there is a chance despite all evidence that he’s okay. We live in a small town on the outskirts of a bigger city, you know the kind where everyone knows each others business and everyone around you feels like they’re entitled to every tiny detail of your life. His family blames me, they think I had something to do with it and because of that so do the authorities. Despite no evidence pointing to me, actually no tangible evidence being found, people still give me weird looks, move away in queues and just generally give me the sense that I’m guilty and I have something to be ashamed of. I know what I did was right.\n\nOur wedding day is coming up in a couple days. I haven’t cancelled it yet because I still hold out hope that he’ll come back. Maybe he isn’t dead or lost, maybe he got scared and left. Maybe what happened 7 months ago wasn’t the reason, maybe this really isn’t my fault. I hate the stares, the whispers, the way I’m treated when I leave our home and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t really leave. I imagine I don’t look the same anymore, I don’t look like the woman you proposed to, the woman you love, but I wouldn’t know. I got rid of all the mirrors a while ago, I couldn’t look at myself after what happened. One morning I woke up in our bed, I made sure everything in our bedroom looks same as it did the day you left, as always I got up and checked my phone. As I was doing that, something felt off, something was different. Maybe it was the air, maybe it was the quiet that felt a little louder today, but something was off.\n\nI couldn’t breathe, the bedroom was getting smaller and smaller, the weight in my chest was heavier than it usually was every morning. Slowly, I walked to the door. My entire body was shaking with… fear? Excitement? Anxiety? Stress? What are you like now? Have you changed after all this time? As I was making my way down the stairs the smell hit me, it was a mix of must, mildew and food. Were you making breakfast? Were you back home? Distracted by my racing thoughts and the sound of my heart pounding in my chest I didn’t notice the water, all the water on the landing. What woke me up from the river of thoughts was my foot stepping into a puddle. I shook myself alert and my eyes darted to the kitchen from which the smell was coming from. The scent of food floating through the house from the open fridge. I ran to the fridge and frantically grabbed the only ray of hope I had these past 7 months. Panicked, my eyes darted to the basement door. It was open. Not wide open, not slightly ajar, it seemed like a cat pushed its way through a door and into the house. Cautiously I edged towards the basement door, gripping the very thing that promised to bring you back, praying it worked, praying you were okay. As I crept down the stairs, I heard you. I heard you breathing, panting more like, but still breathing. As soon as I heard that I ran down, I needed to see you and hear your voice again, know that you’re still by my side. Still, something felt off, the same way something felt different when I woke up. You look different. Tired and older, something is different in your eyes. Something is wrong, dark, stormy in your eyes, almost like it’s not even you. \n\nAs I’m writing this I’m sitting on the stairs staring at the basement door. I don’t think the door will hold for much longer. I’m so so sorry, I just wanted you to be better, I wanted us to be healthier. How could I have known that they were lying, that you wouldn’t come back the same after that, that you wouldn’t be you anymore. How could I have known the new heart wouldn’t be human?",

        "text": "I stood on the dark train station platform, the only illumination coming from a dim yellow light above me. The cold October wind blew, rustling the trees and causing me to pull my coat tighter. The coffee I held in my hand had cooled long ago, providing no comfort against the cold. I looked up and down the empty tree-lined track, the train was supposed to arrive more than an hour ago. \n\nI had thought it would be nice to take the train, remembering all the times I used to visit my grandparents. Me and my grandpa would sit out on the front porch of their little farmhouse, and watch the cargo trains rumble by, carrying lumber. So when I saw there was an option to take a train to visit them, I bought a ticket. I would have given up and taken the bus, but the depot had closed a half hour ago.\n\nSuddenly a loud whistle cut through the air, I looked up in time to see the appearing from the darkness. I was surprised to see it was a steam engine, painted a dark red. A cloud of steam temporarily enveloped the platform as the train came to a stop, obscuring my view of the train. I tossed my empty coffee cup in a nearby trash can, and stepped onto the small platform at the front of one of the cars near the engine. I was once again surprised as I entered the car, it looked as if I had stepped back forty years. The seats were wooden with blood red velvet cushions, and polished wooden tables sat in between each bench.\n\nI picked a seat near the front, placing my bag under the table by my feet. The car was empty except for me, and I saw no staff, not even a conductor. As soon as I settled into my seat, the train began to move. It quickly picked up speed, rattling the whole car. I found myself staring out the window, lost in my thoughts. I almost didn't notice when the train began to slow, and then braked to a stop.\n\nOnce the train came to a full stop, the doors to the car sprung open of their own accord. Three people in black suits entered, walking silently in single file- carrying briefcases. I tried to look at them, and immediately looked away. I could only barely glance at them out of the corner of my eye, if I tried to look directly at them it felt like looking into a bright flashlight. The suits silently took their seats. Even though they had all come in together, they sat separately. Each one took a seat three rows from each other, placing black briefcases by their feet and resting their hands on the table in front of them.\n\nAs soon as they took their seats the train began to move again, it quickly picked up the same speed as before. After a while I found my foot tapping to the beat of the engine, rhythmic and fast. It was only by chance that I caught a glance on the engine as we rounded a bend. There was something off about it. The steam that now spilled from the funnel was too dark, it was black as charcoal and nearly invisible against the dark night sky. Sparks flew from the powerful wheels, appearing almost like flames.\n\nI noticed there were no stars in the night sky, the slightest gradient was the only indication it was there. The tree’s no longer looked like tree’s either, they were gnarled and twisted. The rolling fields of crops were replaced by foggy plains.\n\nThe whistle blew- and once again the train braked. A station seemed to emerge from the darkness. It was a red brick monstrosity, huge pillars supported a massive arched ceiling. Rows and rows of people waited behind small metal gates, as if lined up for an amusement park ride. I could hear a voice speaking over a loudspeaker, but I was unable to make out what it was saying.\n\nAs soon as the train came to a full stop, the whistle blew, and the doors sprung open. The people lined up behind the gates began to slowly move forward, each one pushing past the gate. Suddenly there was a person standing at the door to the car, they wore a conductor's uniform and they held a ticket puncher. They strangely reminded me of the conductor from the polar express.\n\nEach person that boarded held out a ticket to the conductor who punched it, and the person continued into the car. They sat in the nearest seat, three to one bench, as if they had practiced it many times. They didn't say anything, the whole car was silent except for the hiss of the engine and the click of the ticket puncher. There seemed to be no pattern to who would board the train. I saw one woman in a Victorian era dress walk down the aisle and sit calmly in a seat next o a man in a pinstriped suit.\n\nThere was something off about the people besides their array of clothing. They seemed almost… transparent. I could see the outline of the man in the pinstriped suit through the woman in the dress. They seemed to avoid my row, passing it as if it were already full. They also seemed to avoid the seats the three suits occupied.\n\nAs soon as the car was full, the door slammed closed and the whistle blew. Steam billowed out from the sides, engulfing the station completely. As the steam dissipated, the station went with it. We were suddenly moving again, the car already rattling from the speed. Suddenly, as if someone had flipped a switch, the people all around me began to talk. It was quiet, but they began to talk among themselves as if they were best of friends. It didn't seem to be about one topic either. One person talked about Berlin, while another talked about a bakery in france.\n\nThe whistle blew again, reverberating through the car. I thought that now it sounded as if it were the engine screaming. The door to the car opened once more, and a blurry, indistinct shape floated inside. A sound began to emerge from speakers mounted in the ceiling that I hadn't noticed before. It sounded like gravel thrown in a blender. The sound seemed to pulse along with the blob standing in the doorway. Then it flickered, and like an old tv finding a station, a woman flickered into existence in its place. She was speaking, appearing mid sentence.\n\n“-for boarding railway six six six, your one way trip to hell!” she said, like she was an airline attendant thanking passengers on a flight. She was wearing what looked like a cross between a flight attendant uniform and something a jpop star would wear. A black, red, orange, and yellow frilly skirt around her waist made it look as if she was on fire. I gasped slightly, she was exactly my type. The kind of person I would be drawn to instinctively. I watched- entranced as she continued speaking.\n\n“I'm your host Temptation, I'll be serving you on this trip with triple six!” she cheerily said “As a reminder all demons, souls, and salesmen must remain inside the car to avoid total obliteration! There will be no meal, and no food is permitted, we don't want to be eaten by cerberus now do we?” she winked to no one in particular, “And now If you’ll look out the nearest window you’ll see we’re now passing through Purgatory!”\n\nThe souls, for that's what they were, all turned to look out the windows. The dark landscape had changed from a darkened forest to rolling fields. Dense fog rolled across the empty landscape, and I thought I saw figures standing within the clouds of fog. The passengers oohed and ahhed, one of them even raised an old digital camera and snapped a picture.\n\nA voice drew my gaze from the barren landscape. The attendant- Temptation, stood above me, holding out her hand.\n\n“Ticket?” she said, gesturing.\n\n“Umm…” I said, and handed her the ticket for the train I was evidently not on. She examined it, then pulled out a ticket puncher from a hidden pocket and punched it. She handed it back, but kept her hand up when I took the ticket. I stared at it for a second before my brain caught up. I took the granola bar from my backpack and placed it in her gloved hand. She clicked her fingers and it disappeared in a cloud of smoke. She winked at me before walking on down the car, and disappearing into the next one.\n\nI sat there, for lack of a better word, bamboozled. Was this all an elaborate joke? Had I gotten on the wrong train? Who or what had I just spoken to? And most of all, where's my granola bar? I began to stare out the window again, panic starting to seep into me. None of this should be even possible. Maybe I had fallen asleep, or drugged. Yes! That was it! The barista must have drugged my coffee, this was all an elaborate dream.\n\nI collapsed into my seat. I had no idea what was going on. I saw Temptation  making her way towards the front of the car, and as she passed my seat I murmured an “Excuse me.”\n\nTemptation turned- leaning down and placing both elbows on the table, with her head in her hands. “How can I help you?” she said cheerily, winking one eye.\n\n“Umm..” I said, blushing a little, “I think I'm not on the right train.”\n\n“Hmmm…” said the conductor, placing one finger on her cheek in the classic quizzical anime girl look. She held out her hand, and I again placed my ticket on the palm of her hand. A penlight materialized in her hand, and she shone it on and through the punched out area. She finally seemed to come to a conclusion, and she handed back the ticket.\n\n“All good!” she said, “You’re supposed to be here.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, “But uhh… I don't think I… uh, want to be here?”\n\nTemptation's eyes narrowed, and she stood up. She kept the same cheery smile as she grabbed my arm, yanking me out of my seat. It was so hard and fast that I didn't have time to register what had happened before we were out the car door. I was slammed against a small metal railing clinging to the side of the car, purgatory fifteen stories below. We appeared to be crossing a massive stone bridge, that was only the exact width of the train. It gave me a nice view of my certain demise if I were to fall.\n\nI turned, facing Temptation, pressing up against the railing. She stood there- still smiling, and ready to strike a pose with the click of a camera. I was remarkably calm, despite the situation.\n\n“On second thought,” I said, “I think I’ll stay.” Temptation giggled, as if she knew that I would say that. She escorted me inside, and then back to my seat.\n\n“If you need anything, you know where to find me!” said Temptation cheerfully as she walked off.\n\nWith nothing better to do, I took my phone from my pocket- and wondered why I hadn't done so before. I checked the screen. No bars. That was probably to be expected, the underworld probably didn't pay T-mobile for wide coverage. I tried dialing my mom's number anyway. It rang once, then went to voicemail. I hit end call, the realization that I had no idea what was going on just now beginning to catch up with me.\n\nI flipped to the camera app, and aimed my phone out the window. Far below banks of fog rolled across gray fields. I snapped a picture, and tapped to view it. The photo was glitchy and distorted at the edges, like the landscape was reluctant to exist in photo form. I zoomed in on one of the fog banks. Figures of people were silhouetted in the fog, like ghostly shadow puppets.\n\nThe whistle blew and we were suddenly inside a tunnel, red brick walls illuminated by the sparks that flew from the wheels of the train. A chime played through the speakers in the ceiling, and Temptation’s voice followed.\n\n“We're now entering Hell, the drinks car will be open for those who are not incorporeal.”\n\nI looked down at my phone again, and flicked out of the camera. I was about to shut it off, when I saw an app that hadn't been there before. It was titled “Service 666”, the icon was a steam engine with 666 printed on the side. I tapped it and the screen displayed what appeared to be the app's central hub. At the top of the screen a small display scrolled what looked like the next station, a countdown next to it. Three minutes.\n\nOther icons were listed as drinks, tickets, and info. I tapped on the drinks icon and a menu popped up, listing an assortment of beverages and cocktails. They all seemed to be from the 1950’s, the style and names reminiscent of that era. Out of curiosity I tapped on a drink labeled “Devil's kiss tempranillo.” underneath “Aged for 3452 years” as displayed. \n\nI heard movement and I looked up to see Temptation standing there, a glass of wine on a small wooden tray. With the same cheerful smile, she set the glass on the table and left as quickly as she came. The glass was molded like a human skull, the dark red wine that swirled inside reminded me of blood.\n\nI looked back at the screen, which now displayed a description of the wine. It was described as full bodied and sweet, a slight tang with fruity notes and an elegant consistency. Made from fruits from the garden of the underworld. Underneath was a disclaimer, “drinking fruit from the garden of the underworld will not trap you inside of it, hades made that up so persephone would stay.” I lifted the glass and took a sip, I was surprised at the bitter aftertaste, leaving my tongue oddly numb.\n\nThe train whistle blew, and I felt it begin to slow. It eventually rolled to a stop next to an empty station, similar to the one before. The three suits got up, and exited as soon as the doors sprang open. Three more things in suits entered, and I would have mistaken them for the ones who had just left, had I not seen them pass each other. They took the same seats, sitting silently in the same manner as their counterparts. Just as the doors sprang closed another suit slipped inside. Unlike the others I could see their face. They seemed young, maybe twenty three, gray eyes, with bright pink hair that poked out the sides of a black fedora perched precariously on their head.\n\nThey breathed heavily, as if they had just completed a marathon. They looked around the car, their gaze landing on the seat directly in front of me. They walked over, and threw themselves in the seat. They sat there, breathing heavily. Eventually they breathed in deeply, exhaled, and propped their feet up on the table. I moved the wineglass out of the way before it toppled in the wake of their black loafers. They looked at me, then held out their hand.\n\n“Im Arrixoth.” They said “From sales and marketing.”\n\nI cautiously shook their hand “I'm uh, Genevra.”\n\n“What’s someone like you doing on the triple six Genevra?” Arrixoth asked.\n\nI hesitated, “I'm not exactly sure.”\n\n“Ah,” said Arrixoth, “A mistaky, happens from time to time. Train stops at the wrong station, and just happens to pick up an above grounder.”\n\n“Above Grounder?” I asked.\n\n“Y’know,” said Arrixoth, “Above ground, not in hell, kinda self explanatory.”\n\n“What happens when a, uh, above grounder, gets picked up?”\n\n“They usually either get sent back up or die horribly, but you never know.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nA chime sounded over the speakers.\n\n“Entering the first layer of Hell!” said Temptation, “Six hours until we reach the next layer, so enjoy your ride on the triple six railroad!”\n\n“Six hours?” I said.\n\n“We slowly circle down each layer of hell,” Said Arrixoth, “Until we reach the bottom, where all the souls are judged and sentenced.”\n\nAs we talked the sky outside had begun to shift, from a dark black, to glowing red, the twisted trees outlined with a hazy yellow. Arrixoth leaned back in their seat, setting their hat across their face.\n\n“It's going to be a while,” they said “You might want to rest a little.”\n\nReluctantly I sat back, my gaze drawn to the landscape outside. I thought I saw something moving deep in the red-black darkness, something massive with tentacles and long limbs. Despite everything that had happened in the last hour or two, I managed to fall into a fitful sleep.\n\nI awoke suddenly when the train's whistle blew, signaling the descent into the second layer of Hell. I sat up, stretching. Arrixoth still sat sleeping, fedora now even more askew. The landscape outside the train window had shifted to a more yellow hue, and I could see flames dancing in the distance. I checked my phone, the counter in the app now had a new six hour countdown. I remembered what Temptation had said about a drinks car, I slowly stood up and began to walk down the car- towards the back of the train.\n\nAs I stepped out of the car and onto the small platform. I was blasted by a wave of scorching hot air, ash and dust stung my eyes. I tried my best to shield them as I quickly stepped into the next car. It was identical to the previous car, except every seat was filled with ghostly passengers. I quickly passed from car to car, until five cars down I entered into the drinks car.\n\nA long polished black wooden bar ran down the length of the car. Several more suits sat at the bar, a variety of drinks and spirits in glasses and bottles. A large bartender stood behind the bar, polishing several glasses with a rag. The instant I sat on one of the rickety stools, he turned- regarding me suspiciously.\n\nI ordered a drink off of a small rainbow light board, like one of the ones from a cheap restaurant. The bartender reached up to the shelves of bottles, grabbing one filled with a dark blue liquid. The bottle was twisted, like it was solidified taffy. The bartender expertly measured some of the liquid into a strangely shaped glass, an inverted pyramid held up by root like tendrils. The bartender measured a second liquid in, this one clear. It sank to the bottom, bubbling slightly- sending ripples through the top liquid. The bartender set the drink in front of me, a paper napkin slipping underneath the glass.\n\nI reached for the glass, but the bartender grabbed my hand.\n\n“How you going to pay for dat?” he said in a thick Dublin accent.\n\nI slowly took a twenty from my jacket pocket and handed it to him, the bartender took it with a grunt. He released my hand and I shook it before carefully picking up the drink. I sipped from the corner of the glass, the blue liquid was silky smooth. The bottom liquid seemed thick in comparison, flowing like honey through the top liquid. Try as I might, I couldn't quite pin down the flavor of either one. \n\nThere was movement to my right as Arrixoth sat in the stool beside me.\n\n“The usual.” They said to the bartender, then turned to me. “You should try the cheesy fries.”\n\n“I thought we weren't allowed to have food.” I said.\n\nArrixoth laughed, “Yea, it's more like airplane mode. They still kinda enforce it, but it's not necessary. Cerberus hasn't eaten anyone in at least two weeks. Besides, as long as we're in here, no smell gets out.”\n\nThe bartender set a drink in front of Arrixoth. It looked like a regular martini, except for a film of dark red on top that was slowly seeping into the drink. They carefully sipped from the glass, maintaining the proportions of the red film to the rest of the drink.\n\n“Y’know Hell has a surprisingly big market for alcohol. Most of the topsides major brands are either run or sourced straight from layer three.” Said Arrixoth, examining their drink. They spent the next ten minutes explaining the imports and exports of various alcoholic beverages, as well as the deep and surprisingly bloody history of the oldest grape fields.\n\nArrixoth was in the middle of explaining the logistics of exporting alcohol out of Hell, when they were interrupted by a loud deep horn. It shook the car, vibrating so hard that bottles and glasses fell from behind the bar.\n\n“What was that?” I asked, removing my hands from my ears. But before Arrixoth could answer, there was the sound of shattering glass and the bartender stumbled. We both looked up at him, where an arrow had sprouted from his chest. Slowly, he toppled, crashing to the floor- sending glasses flying. I stared, wide-eyed. Arrixoth looked more annoyed than worried. “Damn.” They said, “I liked him. Knew how to make a good drink too.”\n\nArrixoth grabbed my hand, and began to pull me back towards our car.\n\n“C’mon, we should get back before she gets here.”\n\n“Who?” I asked, dodging out of the way of a running conductor.\n\n“Greed.” answered Arrixoth.\n\nAs we made our way back to our car two people on horses rode up beside the train, and leaped onto the narrow platform in front of us. They looked like they had just walked off the set of Pirates of the Caribbean, and both held a curved sword. Arrixoth ducked under the blade of the first, and I narrowly avoided the tip of the others.\n\nWe passed a trio of conductors, each wielding a variation of the same sword. By the time we got back to our own car, a battle was raging across the entire train. Several conductors were locked in battle with a group of the pirates, standing on tables and leaping off seats. Arrixoth weaving in and out of the fray like it was nothing, pulling me along through it all. The Pirates seemed disinterested in us, only attacking the conductors and only taking warning swings at us as we ran by. We reached our seats and Arrixoth shoved me into my seat, before returning to their own.\n\n“What's going on?” I asked, shouting to be heard over the sounds of battle.\n\n“Greed’s hijacking the train.” Arrixoth calmly replied, pulling out a deck of cards from their suit pocket. “Go fish?”\n\n“Why is Greed hijacking the train?” I asked, still shouting.\n\n“This train carries the most valuable cargo.” replied Arrixoth, dealing cards on the table. “Souls are highly valuable, the most powerful energy source known.” They picked up the dealt cards. “Red six?”\n\n“Umm,” I picked up my cards “Go fish?”\n\nArrixoth drew a card from the deck, “Greed being Greed sometimes tries to raid the train, stealing as many souls as she can.”\n\n“Red queen?” I say, “Does this happen often?” A wickedly sharp scimitar whistled past my ear, slicing clean through the right side seat Arrixoth sat in.\n\nArrixoth handed me their card and said “Not often, especially since Temptation took charge of the train. Black two?”\n\nI handed Arrixoth the card, “You say ‘The train’ isn't there more?”\n\n“Nope, this is the only train. It collects once a week.”\n\n“How does everyone fit on the train?”\n\n“It's infinite, or supposedly. Right now it has maybe twenty thousand cars, give or take a few hundred. I think the most its had was sixty thousand, but that was back in world war two.”\n\nJust then there was the sound of rapidly clashing blades, and we both looked up to see Temptation fighting another woman entering the car. Temptation was dual wielding two long and sharp knives, slashing at the other woman so fast her arms were just a blur. The other wore a dark green dress, the dark fabric seemned to shimmer in the car's yellow lighting. A black bodice was cinched tightly around her chest, and a large pirate captain's hat with a black feather sat on her head.  Greed carried a sharp silver rapier, expertly parrying each of Temptation's attacks. Both women spat curses at each other, as Greed slowly forced Temptation back.\n\nGreed feinted left, twisting her rapier at the last moment. It left Temptation off balance and Greed kicked her legs out from underneath her. Temptation fell, smashing through our table and sending cards flying.\n\n“Oh dear.” said Arrixoth, not looking the least bit concerned. The empty wine glass that I had left on the table was now in millions of pieces, leaving shards no bigger than a grain of sand- and decorating the floor like snow. Temptation tried to get up, but Green put a boot to her chest- forcing her back down. As the last conductor fell, a cheer went through the surviving pirates.\n\nA few of the pirates pulled out ornately decorated glass amphoras with large obsidian stoppers. They removed the stoppers and the souls began to melt like butter thrown into a hot pan, streaming into the containers and filling them with a white glowing energy. Once all the souls were sucked in the pirates replaced the stoppers, trapping the swirling energy. Greed turned and looked right at me, and for a second I thought she would turn her rapier on me. Instead she stabbed it down into Temptations chest, causing her to gasp and then cough- splattering blood all over Greed's black leather boots.\n\nThe pirates cheered again as Greed pulled the rapier from Temptations chest, turning to face her comrades and raising her rapier high. Temptation still held one of her knives, and in a moment of pure stupidity I grabbed it and plunged the knife into Greed’s back. She stared down at the blade now protruding from her stomach, then she slowly fell- sliding off the blade and collapsing to the floor. \n\nThe pirates froze, expressions of shock on their faces. Their shock quickly turned to anger, and I realized what I had just done. The pirates drew their swords once more, and began to advance towards me. I held up the knife like some kind of shield- hoping that they would at least back off at the sight of the weapon that had killed their boss. \n\nI didn't have the chance to test that theory; just as the pirates were about to reach me, the doors of the car burst open and a stream of conductors poured in. They quickly overpowered the few pirates left, cutting them down like paper. They carefully took the amphorae, removing the stoppers and letting the souls fly back to their seats. The souls resumed talking, like they hadn’t just been kidnaped by a bunch of hellish pirates.\n\nAt my feet Temptation coughed, and sat up- brushing glass shards and splinters from her dress. The wound in her chest was oozing a dark purple liquid, which stuck to her hand like syrup when she carefully prodded it. I watched as the ooze crystallized into a hard substance, which Temptation peeled off- leaving no trace of the injury. As Temptation stood up, the table began to reassemble itself. Temptation kicked Greed, causing that part of her to disintegrate and sent a plume of ash into the air. The kick started a chain reaction, and I watched as Greed’s body slowly crumbled to nothing- only leaving a dark coating of dust on the expensive carpet.\n\n“She’ll be back.” said Temptation, picking up her knife from the floor. “It might take a few years, but she’ll reform eventually.”  \n“What did I do?” I asked, and I noticed my hand was shaking.\n\n“You killed her.” said Temptation with a wink, she reached into a hidden pocket and pulled out a golden coupon. She handed it to me, in fancy cursive lettering “One free drink” was printed below the triple six logo. Temptation winked again, and without another word she turned and left.\n\n“Well,” said Arrixoth, “That was exciting.” Shortly after a crew of conductors had come by with dusters. They cleaned up the car, leaving no evidence of what had transpired.\n\n“I- I killed her.” I said, still in shock.\n\n“Mmm-hmm.” said Arrixoth, “I don't think anyone’s killed Greed in the past hundred years.” They leaned forward, as if they had a secret to tell. “You should talk to the big man himself,” They whispered, cupping a hand over their mouth, “Greed’s been a real pain in his forked tail for a while, you might get a nice bonus.” I nodded, still staring at my shaking hand.\n\nThe rest of the trip went rather smoothly. We passed through fields of grapes on layer three, watched fiery waterfalls on four, and passed a burning city of five. Arrixoth spent most of the time talking about marketing strategies and profit margins. As we circled the final layer, a massive castle came into view. Massive stone towers held up by statues of various mythological creatures, and a massive wall encircled the entire castle for miles. \n\nAs we passed through a tunnel in the wall and came out the other side, I saw that there was a massive city laid out around the castle. It looked like it had survived a world war, skyscrapers with their steel skeletons exposed, and stone buildings half collapsed. The castle that stood in the center of the city only seemed to grow larger as we neared, rising higher than the tallest skyscrapers in the ruined city. \n\nThe train came to a stop just outside the castle walls, a station similar to the old brick station rolled into view. As the train came to its final stop, the ghostly passengers began to file out of the train, lining up silently behind a row of turnstiles at the end of the station platform. Arrixoth stretched and grabbed their hat and briefcase from underneath the table. They looked back at me as they stood.\n\n“You coming?” they said, before walking towards the door.\n\nWe walked along the perimeter of the station, passing rows and rows of spirits. One by one the spirits filed through a set of turnstiles. As soon as they passed through they morphed into a ball of softly glowing light, flying off into the distance to presumably be punished for eternity. Conductors ran up and down the station, unloading wooden crates from the cars. I looked down the length of the train, and it and the station seemed to stretch off into the distance forever- not even stopping at the walls of the massive city.\n\nWe crossed over a small bridge, passing over the train and to the platform on the other side. Near the engine I saw Temptation talking with a man in a sharp suit, and as we got closer I noticed that he also had horns and a forked red tail. Temptation was looking annoyed, her arms crossed and eyes narrowed.\n\n“Ah,” said the man, “So this is the one who killed Greed?” His voice was deep and resonating, like a chorus of bullfrogs through a tunnel.\n\n“Your…you,” I stammered.\n\n“Yes, I'm the devil himself. I'm not Hades though, he’s around here somewhere.”\n\n“Umm…” was all I could manage.\n\n“I suppose I should thank you for dealing with Greed. Her attacks have become more violent and bold lately, your little stunt will probably make her think twice next time.” He pulled a paper from a pocket of his finely tailored suit, “In fact, I’d like to offer you a job. Don't worry I'm not going to ask for your soul, this is the standard contract- you can quit at any time.”\n\nI carefully took the paper, skimming over the densely packed legal text. At the bottom was a single signature line. I read through the document thoroughly. The pay- and yes there was pay - was more than triple my current job. I took a pen from my backpack and clicked it open, and signed my job contract with the devil.",

        "text": " My eyes adjusted slowly, and I could make out the shapes of things around me. I was in a damp, musty basement. The walls were made of cold stone, and the floor was littered with damp leaves. A single window on the far wall let in a small amount of moonlight, but not much else.\n\nI tried to get up, but my arms and legs were too weak to move. I felt as if I had been sleeping for days, but I couldn't remember how I had gotten there. I didn't recognize the place, and I had no idea how I had arrived.\n\nI started to panic, and my breathing began to quicken. I was about to scream for help, when I heard a faint noise coming from the corner of the room. It sounded like a low, rumbling growl.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and I felt a chill run down my spine. It was a sound that I had heard before, but never in a place like this. I knew it was the sound of a wild animal, and I had no idea what it was.\n\nI tried to move towards the sound, but my body was still too weak. I was barely able to crawl across the floor. As I got closer, the growling grew louder, and I noticed a strange smell in the air. It smelled like death.\n\nWhen I finally reached the corner, I saw a pair of yellow eyes staring back at me from the darkness. The creature was huge, and I could make out its thick fur and powerful claws in the dim light. I was paralyzed with fear, but I managed to choke out a single word.\n\n\"Who... who are you?\"\n\nThe creature didn't answer. Instead, it stepped closer, and I could feel its hot breath on my face. I closed my eyes and prayed for it to end. But instead of attacking me, the creature sniffed me a few times before turning and walking away. I was too stunned to move, and instead I stayed in the darkness, watching it until it disappeared into the shadows.\n\nI stayed in the basement for hours, too scared to move. I eventually mustered up the courage to explore the place, and I quickly realized that I wasn't alone. There were strange things hidden in the darkness, things that made me shudder with fear.\n\nThere were bones scattered across the floor, some of them human. There were strange bottles and jars filled with an unknown liquid, and strange symbols painted on the walls.\n\nEventually, I stumbled across a door leading out of the basement. When I opened it, I found myself in a disused laboratory. I had no idea what the place was used for, but I quickly realized that it had been recently occupied.\n\nThe laboratory was filled with strange machines and contraptions, some of them still running. There was a faint humming noise coming from one corner, and I could see a faint light glowing from beneath a door.\n\nI slowly walked towards it, and opened the door. Inside, I found a man sitting at a desk, staring intently at a computer screen. He didn't seem to notice me at first, and I stood there, too scared to speak.\n\nFinally, the man looked up and stared at me. His face was pale and his eyes were wide with fear. He quickly called out a single word.\n\n\"Run!\"",

        "text": "Three men walked into a bar: a priest in traditional garments, an orthodox rabbi, and a wild-looking fellow decked in ragged robes known as the necromancer. \n\nThe bar was dimly lit. I and a few elderly patrons sipped whiskey silently, reeking of despair. The rabbi and priest exchanged grim glances. They were completely out of place. \n\n“Cheer up, gentleman. You’ll never have to see me or this bar again after tonight. It’ll all just be a horrible nightmare.” Cloaked in darkness, the filthy necromancer cackled with delight. \n\nThey sat towards the back of the room. A stern-faced waitress brought a round of shots. The necromancer gobbled all three in seconds. \n\n“Fuck that burns! I don’t know how you religious types live so piously, such a waste of life. Sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll — that’s how I roll.”\n\n“God is all we need. His light fills us.” \n\n“God? Remind me why you’re here again?” The necromancer howled with laughter, banging his fist on the table. \n\n“Even God has his blind spots.” The rabbi whispered, head slung down. \n\n“I suppose I’m that blind spot. How delightful.” The necromancer motioned for another round. “So who is this woman?” \n\n“That is none of your concern.” \n\n“Alright, I can take a hint. I’ll shut my mouth. With the amount you’re paying me, I don’t need to know shit.” \n\nThe waitress brought more shots which the necromancer greedily downed in quick succession. Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air. The rabbi and priest looked annoyed. \n\n“We’re short on time. We need to get this started.” Jaw clenched, the priest rapped his knuckles on the table. \n\n“Are you blind? We’ve already begun.”\n\nSmoke twisted unnaturally around the group. It moved with sentience. Dancing in tight circles, a green aura began to emanate from within. \n\n“We can’t do this here! People will see.” \n\n“They’ll see what I want them to see. this is my church and they are my flock. Just like you deliver the holy sacrament from the pew, I must do the same.”\n\nThe other patrons kept themselves drowned in their drinks. I leaned back in my chair, acting aloof. Sunglasses obscured my intense gaze. \n\nSnatching an empty glass from the table, the necromancer motioned for the priest and rabbi to place their fingers on the rim. The Necromancer shook violently, eyes rolling back in his head. \n\n“I call upon the kingdom of darkness to heed our call. We beckon the spirits of the underworld to fill this glass. Let them come forth and give life of the life to the lifeless; to perverse the natural order and speak the words unspoken.”\n\nI took furious notes, transcribing every word. No one else seemed to notice the unnatural ceremony. The other patrons were in a complete stupor.\n\n“Come forth! Come forth! Come forth! I command you!” \n\nLights flickered in the bar. I shivered as a frigid air washed over me. Haunted whispers filled the room. \n\nThe necromancer grew suddenly silent. A red liquid filled the glass from an unseen source; it boiled and bubbled. Both the priest and rabbi sat stoically, the latter wincing for only a moment. \n\nA clap of thunder echoed in the distance. The smoke cleared and other patrons showed life again. It was like a dark cloud had passed over us. \n\n“Take this drink and give it to her. My work is done, so I suggest you take your leave gentleman. Ok? Get the fuck out of here. Unpleasant things tend to linger after the ceremony is completed and they loathe men like you.” \n\n“I’d say thank you, but I can’t say I’m thankful for this. Still…I appreciate your efforts. You’ve done more good than you realize.” Raising from his seat, the priest grabbed the drink and walked towards the exit. \n\n“Sure, sure — whatever makes you feel better,” the necromancer burped loudly, “Good, bad, evil — they’re all shades of grey to me buddy. The only color that matters to me is green.” \n\nAfter the priest and rabbi took their leave, I counted to twenty and followed. I tailed them from a safe distance. We walked down a dark and twisting alley. Parked underneath a broken street lamp was an aging hearse. It seemed all too comfortable in the darkness. \n\n“Shall we?” Glancing back and forth, the rabbi opened the trunk. I peered behind a trash can, remaining hidden. \n\n“Yes. It must be done. May God have mercy on our souls.” \n\nThey prayed silently for a moment. I had a hard time believing God was listening. \n\nHolding the glass together, the priest and the rabbi held it over the trunk. A limp arm rolled onto the bumper. It was ashen white and thin as a rail.\n\n“Hands up! Police department! Don’t move you sick fucks!” I burst from my hiding spot. Gun in hand, I ordered the pair to the ground.\n\nThey ignored me and turned their backs. I yelled again, but they acted as if I wasn’t there. Their actions were frantic, fumbling with the latches of a burlap sack. Taking decisive action, I tasered them both, bringing them to their knees. A yellowed scroll rolled out of the bag. The rabbi tried to reach for it, but I stomped on his hand. \n\nA half dozen squad cars peeled into the alley shortly. They’d been parked down the street awaiting my signal. \n\n“You fool! You have no idea what you’ve waded into. You’re dooming us all.” The priest screeched as he was cuffed.\n\n“Please, sir. You must let us finish what we started. She cannot stay dead. The Dark Mother must live or we will all die.” Lips quivering, the rabbi begged. \n\n“Enough! You’re finished. Whatever twisted rituals you’re caught up in are over. Take them away boys.” I motioned for the uniformed officers to place them in a squad car.\n\nAs they were driven away the two never broke their gaze. Their stares were mournful, tinged with pity. \n\nAfter they were gone, I shuffled over to the car. A woman’s corpse was stuffed awkwardly into the trunk. She looks to be in her early thirties and had been dead for some time. Her face was frozen in an expression of joy — it gave me the creeps. I could have sworn her eyes followed me, but I chalked that up to my mental exhaustion. We’d been tipped off to her murder by an anonymous phone call, and I’d been shadowing the suspects for weeks. \n\nI waited for the coroner to take her away. As they zipped her into a bag, I noticed the smile had grown wider. A cold shiver ran down my spine. \n\nThree weeks later I was sipping wine at home when I heard a booming knock at my door. On my doorstep was a crudely wrapped binder, filled with a series a documents. Taped to the front was a letter crudely scrawled with a fading pen.\n\n*Dear Officer Franklin,*\n\n*I do not blame you for what’s to come. You were manipulated by forces as ancient as time itself. That said, only you can prevent further tragedy.* \n\n*I know you have the scroll with you. Something deep in your soul compelled you to take it home, which means God has heaved this burden onto you — just as me and my compatriot were called forth to duty.* \n\n*One year ago a brutal exorcism was performed on a ‘Jane Doe’ in rural Alabama. The demon was unlike anything we’d previously encountered, and half a dozen perished during the ritual. That includes the woman, who succumbed to her injuries.

I’d received a number of communications from disgruntled criminals over the years, but this was the craziest. I was more thought disturbed that he’d been able to mail it to my home address. \n\nNeeding to calm myself, I clicked on the TV. A stern-faced reporter started back at me. The chyron scrolling on the bottom of the screen flashed with updates of numerous massacres in large cities. \n\n“Scientists are flummoxed by a series of natural disasters that have struck, almost simultaneously across the globe. Millions are dead and even more are missing. This coincides with a striking rise of mass casualty events.”\n\nI shut off the television. A knot formed in my stomach. Reaching for my phone, I dialed the coroner's office.\n\n“Paul, this is Officer Franklin. This is going to sound odd, but can you check on the ‘Jane Doe’ we brought in a few weeks back? I receive a tip that something might be — unmmm — odd. Yeah, odd….”\n\n“You haven’t heard? We had a break-in early this morning. They stole everything, including all the bodies in cold storage. The FBI is here as we speak. You should come on by.”\n\nI made an excuse about an incoming call and quickly hung up. My ears were ringing. I picked up the binder I’d discarded in the trash after receiving the priest’s letter. \n\nBOOM. Another knock on the door. I clutched my service weapon and tip-toed toward the sound. Peering through a peephole, my heart sank.\n\nA middle age woman with ashen skin and sunken eyes stood on my doorstep. She was blowing on her nails, seemingly bored. I knew that face — Jane Doe.\n\nI hurriedly stuffed the binder into the backpack Id earlier stashed the scroll and fled out the back door. As I sped away in my car, I saw her smiling and waving. She’d somehow made her way onto the roof. \n\n“You can run, but you can’t hide. Nowhere is safe. Once my father comes, nothing will be left. See you soon.” It sounded like she was whispering directly into my ear. \n\nThat’s how I ended up in a seedy dive bar on the outskirts of Chicago. A man who looked homeless joined me at my table. He smiled wide revealing a mouth full of rotted teeth. \n\n“I gotta say you don’t look like my usual clientele. Don’t smell like them either. So, who is she?”\n\n[“That is none of your concern.” I laughed quietly to myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightProfessor/)",

        "text": "I’m not really a big believer in supernatural things. I’d rather said I’m more of a skeptic guy. But at the same time, I’m not saying that I strongly deny an existence of supernatural. Anyway, I have always found mystic and scary stuff fascinating and interesting, and occasionally, I love reading or watching something related to it. \n\nSo, it happened 10 years ago. I was 13 then. It was a usual evening. I came back from my school, got a rest, a dinner, did some homework for tomorrow classes and chilled after in a video-game some time. Nothing special, 90% of my evenings used to be like that back in the day. Towards the end of a day, I did everything for tomorrow, took a shower, prepared for a night and lied down on the bed in my room. I loved reading a book some time before I fall asleep. And exactly during that process it happened to me.\n\nIt was around 10:30-11 pm. I used to live with my mom, and she usually went to sleep earlier than me, a bit. At that moment she was already sleeping, I knew it exactly. No chance it was her. She also loves to read before falling asleep, and I could know when she finishes it. Because the thing is, my mom doesn’t fully close the room door for a night, so it has a slight gap, and you could hear the switch and comprehend when she turns off the light in her room. And the same I used to do, didn’t close the room door entirely, so I could sleep with a light in the corridor (I had nyctophobia then). Not only that, my room and mom’s one are very close to each other, separated only with one wall. And when you go out from any of them, you get straightly to the corridor. Secondly, we used to have a rabbit, but we always made sure we locked it in its cage in the kitchen for a night. Hence, it’s also couldn’t be a rabbit. So, what happened? \n\nI was reading a book and felt like it would be the time to finally turn off the light and fall asleep in a couple of minutes. (Now, I remind you, my mom’s door and mine are slightly open and not closed fully). Suddenly, I heard a strange noise coming out of the corridor. It was fairly clear noise and I could hear it pretty well as it was total silence in the flat. It was like… Like somebody was very slowly walking away from my room door, going to the third room in the end of the corridor. But it didn’t sound like a usual walking. The noise was something like if someone put on slippers on their legs, but one of them is broken or injured, thereby making it drag it on the floor.\n\nAnd it sounded like IT made a slow step with his healthy leg, and after made a second one, pulling his injured leg on the floor in slippers. And in that god-damn moment, after a couple of seconds since it started, I realized everything in my head. \n\nLike, there are only my mom and I here at the flat. Mom is sleeping, and if she awakened, I would surely understand it. My rabbit is locked in its cage in the kitchen. Neighbors, you might say? Well, our house is older than 100 years, and it has solid brick walls with high ceilings. Very rarely it could be some noise going out from the neighbors, but god-damn NOT LIKE THAT AND NOT SO CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RIGHT TO MY ROOM. Thus, I rapidly excluded every possible reason of the sound which I thought may hypothetically be in a couple of moments. \n\nAs I could understand, it was slowly moving away from my room to the last one of the corridor, as I mentioned before. The sound lasted for maybe just about 6–8 seconds and… just disappeared. It didn’t get quieter, it didn’t change itself. It was continuously the same noise with the same volume for 6–8 seconds going away from my door. And after that time has passed, it just vanished. Like it has never been any of it there. And while the noise was occurring, and when I understood that I totally have no idea what could do such sounds, I became numbed as fuck and felt like I raised roots into my bed. I couldn’t move, I was scared to death even trying to breathe. My heart rate was so fast that I thought my heart will either drop out of my chest or either just stopped. I felt such a feral, ice-cold horror. And it just paralyzed me so much that I remained in the same posture I was when the noise appeared. I was so scared, but at the same time, I really wanted to know what or who was making those sounds. But the fear was stronger than my curiosity, and it didn’t let me stand up and check out what was going on in the corridor. \n\nI have no idea how much time I spent being in one posture without any movement and trying not to breathe. I really don’t know how much time has passed since the noise ended, and I could finally stand up from my bed and check out the corridor because in such situation while being afraid to death feeling of the time changes. It’s like it ceases to make any sense of what time is and for what it’s needed. But, it seemed to me it has passed approximately 20 minutes since the sound ended, but it also could be longer or shorter in fact. Finally, breaking the shackles of a terror and regaining the ability to move, I stood up and opened the door. \n\nSure thing, I didn't notice anything special. Like absolutely nothing, just my corridor lightened with lamps. My mom's door was in the same position in the way it always used to be. I had a thought to come in that third room towards where IT was moving and check it. But I decided it won't be a really cool and clever idea, I still was very frightened. I came back to my room, closed the door and additionally locked it. I returned to my bed with total mind chaos in my head, overthinking what or who was making that noise. And I don't remember how I fell asleep and how much time it took me to do that. \n\nIn the morning, when I woke up, I asked my mom whether she heard anything last night or not. She said she didn't, and I told her that story. But I don't remember what she replied to me to this and what was her reaction. \n\nSo, that's it. It was the first time I have ever encountered with something unusual like that. Nowadays, I still have no clue what those noises were and whom did they belong. \n\nAny thoughts what it could be?",

        "text": "I hope this post reaches you, Jessica, wherever you may be. I know you have little reason to hear me out, and I cannot blame you in the slightest. I’ve had some time to self reflect since you’ve fled, and I realize that my attempt to aid you may have caused more psychological harm than good. So here I sit, inside your home writing this on Adam’s phone (not password protected, for some reason). Ah…no, forgive me, Jessica. Adam is probably the last thing you wish to be reminded of. Well, and me of course. \n\nI wish to plead my case to you, Jessica, so you might understand how things have turned out this way. I pray for your forgiveness but do not expect to receive it. I think I’ve made peace with that. Still, please just listen to what I have to say. Your judgement may come after, and I’ll accept whatever it may be.\n\nI…I don’t remember where I came from, or even what I truly am. As far back as I can remember, I’ve been in this old house, aimlessly wandering its barren halls while feasting on whatever rodents or insects I could find. Before then, everything is fuzzy. I’ve tried to remember where I was before stumbling into this place, but it’s like a deep fog fills my mind when I try to recall. There’s nothing there, and so here I remain. Why not leave, you might ask. Believe me, I’ve tried, Jessica, but…my feet always pause at the front door. Something deep inside me compels me to remain; something I am unable to resist. I can almost hear something whispering a strange sound that might be my name, coaxing me back into the deepest parts of the building. I must have spent years in here, maybe decades? Time has a strange habit of disappearing when you try to keep track of it. Either way, my existence, if one could even call it that, was a lonely one. Every day was the same, and only the light filtering through the boarded windows gave me any semblance of schedule. The days were filled with endless pacing with nothing to occupy my thoughts, with an occasional pest fit to be eaten breaking apart the monotony. I wasn’t living, I can’t even be sure if I was sentient. I was a dumb, lowly creature who lived in a prison, beaten down by the sheer apathy of the walls surrounding me until my mind was an empty void. I would’ve stayed that way until I faded into nothing, if it wasn’t for you.\n\nPerhaps if I had peeked through the boarded windows, I would’ve noticed the “For Sale” sign, which was soon replaced with “Sold”. I may have noticed the moving truck pulling into the drive way, and I may have seen the line of people carrying cardboard boxes approaching the front door. Instead, I was just swallowing a cockroach at the bottom of the stairs when I saw the door swing open. I scrambled out of sight, fearing this sudden change in repetition. I watched from around the corner as creatures that looked almost like myself marched in single file, before spreading out and setting down boxes in various spots around the house. I suppose it must seem silly, Jessica, that I could look at you humans and feel fear, but at that time I was like a sheltered child and didn’t know any better. One of the movers might’ve caught sight of me, but I know this house much better than you do, and I disappeared before he could register the monstrosity gazing at him. This house is full of secrets, Jessica. Hidden doors and walkways have hollowed it out long before I was here. You may believe you’ve discovered them all, but there’s still quite a sizable amount I’ve kept hidden for myself.\n\nI was panicking as I crawled through the hidden walkways, wondering who these people were and what they were doing in my home. I felt like a mouse surrounded by cats, cornered with no escape and believing that my fate was sealed. I wanted to curl up and cry, I wanted to sob in terror but I forced myself to observe you all. And…I’m glad I did. It allowed me to meet you, Jessica.\n\nI don’t know what it was about you that awoke these feelings inside me. It wasn’t anything you said or did, so perhaps it was some human desire deep inside me that I hadn’t realized existed. I suppose I could lie and write this out to seem more poetic and romantic, but I believe honesty is important after what happened. I believe I was simply curious because you, being a woman, were on a physical level different than the movers carrying your boxes. As I continued to observe you throughout your stay here, I picked up on the social norms between men and women and what I felt for you progressed through there. But, I am getting ahead of myself. I apologize, I don’t wish to make you feel uncomfortable, Jessica.\n\nIn my limited intelligence, I did not know what the bruise on your arm meant at the time. I did not know what torment you were going through, but one of the movers certainly did. I saw him question you about it, I saw you roll down your sleeve and hastily explain it away while looking over your shoulder. I wonder why you didn’t tell him the truth; perhaps he could’ve helped you and this whole situation could’ve been avoided. No, no…I’m sorry again, Jessica. You must think I’m blaming you and that is not what I intend to do. It’s just difficult for me to collect all my thoughts now that I have access to writing. I could go on and on about how amazing this smartphone is, but this isn’t about me. Not really. I’ll remain focused on the story, because I need you to understand why this all happened.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until much later that I figured out the situation: you and Adam had purchased what was labeled as a “fixer-upper”. I feel like I should’ve been offended, but looking back at the state of the house then I realize that perhaps I could’ve spruced it up just a bit. I watched cautiously from my safe space behind the stairs as you and Adam waved to the movers as they finished unloading your belongings and left the house. With only the three of us left, I began to relax. It was feeling much less crowded, and I was about to retreat when you let out a sharp gasp of pain. I turned towards you and saw Adam gripping your bruised arm violently. He was hissing something in your ear, his voice dripping with such venom that even I, in my limited understanding, felt poisoned and filthy hearing it. He threw you down, and demanded you finish unpacking everything while he retreated towards the kitchen. You laid there for a minute, your quiet sniffles barely audible to me. I wanted to emerge from my hiding place and comfort you, for I didn’t know why he would do such a thing to you. But deep down I must’ve known my appearance would frighten you because I remained hidden. I am ashamed of the fact, but maybe I shouldn’t be after what happened last night. Maybe I was always meant to lurk in the shadows, always present but never interfering. You slowly rose to your feet, wiping the tears from your eyes as you began your thankless task of making this damned house suitable. And I left you for the darkness.\n\nI continued to observe you and Adam throughout your stay, growing more accustomed to the sudden invasion of what had always been just my space. You were my link to a world beyond what I thought possible, and I grew fond of you. I learned from you. You’re such a sweet, loving person, Jessica, and I hope you know that. Despite the man you lived with, you were always smiling when talking to your mother. You were always laughing with your favorite show. You always sang such beautiful melodies when you did your chores. I learned to speak from you, did you know that? My speech isn’t perfect, but I made sure to practice every night while you and Adam slept. You would tell Adam you heard voices the following morning, but he always refused to believe you. \n\nEvery day excited me once I grew to know you. I would eagerly race through the walls, following you and Adam throughout the house to learn more about you. Adam thought I was a particularly noisy rat, but I can assure you I had eaten all the rats already. I feasted instead on whatever leftovers made it into the trash. You cook such wonderful meals, Jessica. Never before had I experienced such fantastic flavors. \n\nI even encountered your cat, Lucy! I was surprised she had found me one day, but I was even more surprised when she didn’t show any fear towards me. I loved Lucy, you know, just like you did. She was my only companion during your stay, and she brought me a level of comfort and friendship that I’ll cherish in my memories forever. She would rub up against my gaunt leg and purr deeply when my fingers carefully scratched behind her ears. When she went missing, you were distraught. You searched everywhere for her but I should’ve left my walls and told you the truth. It was Adam, though I suspect that part of you knew it all along. He grabbed Lucy and dragged her outside. I watched in distress through the window as he drove away with her. I wanted to rush out and stop him but that nagging whisper prevented me from doing so. I sat there, helpless as he took her away to God knows where. I wish I was stronger, Jessica. I was right there and yet I couldn’t save our precious cat. I am so sorry for failing Lucy. You can add that to your list of my unforgivable deeds.\n\nI hated Adam. I hated him for hurting you, I hated him for throwing Lucy away, and I hated him for tarnishing my home with his pathetic stench. I witnessed his cruel acts too many times to count, and I could count every individual scar and bruise he gave you. He was a plague upon you and I. I still don’t know how you two met or why you married him because I cannot imagine him as a good person. He was loud, and cruel, and he drank and drank like there was no tomorrow. He threw things, he had temper tantrums, he whined and stomped like an arrogant child and his actions echoed throughout the house so I always had to hear him. I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to inflict upon him every ounce of torment he directed towards us. \n\nI tell you this, Jessica, because I need you to understand me. I know I hurt you but I need you to know that what I did I did to try to save you. Because…because I love you, Jessica. We never shared a word but I felt like I knew everything about you. I know your secrets and your treasures, I see the cute way your nose twitches like a mouse when you smile, I listen to you sing and watch you dance and observe how FREE you are when Adam isn’t in the house. I know you’re not some submissive house wife who bows to her monstrous husband’s every demand. I see you for the remarkable woman you truly are. And he never saw that and he never WANTED to see it and it made me SO GODDAMN ANGRY THAT HE WOULD REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THAT! THAT THE ARROGANT PRICK WOULD SOMEHOW FIND SOME INANIMATE TROPHY A FITTING REPLACEMENT FOR A PARTNER! THAT I WAS A DAMN COWARD FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND DID NOTHING! AND THAT’S WHY I FINALLY HAD TO DO IT JESSICA! TO SAVE YOU!\n\nI was in the second story bathroom dow the hall from where you and he slept when it happened. I rarely emerged from the hidden rooms but I found myself in a rare moment to myself. I gazed upon my ghastly figure in the mirror, tracing my long fingers across my body. I met my yellowed, decaying eyes in my reflection and wondered if I had always been dying here slowly. If I could ever really be with you. I was so much taller than both you and Adam and my skin clung tightly to my emaciated figure. I had never put much thought into how I looked before but in that moment I felt a deep sense of insecurity. I was a walking corpse; twisted and stretched beyond human recognition. A woman such as you could never love a monster like I.\n\nAnd then I heard you scream. I heard you beg Adam to stop and he yelled at you to shut up. He snarled such vicious lies, telling you that you’d never be worth anything and that you were lucky to be with him. I listened, hating every word he screeched but doing nothing to help you. I stood there like I always did, waiting for the abuse to end but then you started gasping. Your screams were cut off and you made noises that sounded like hacking. I heard Adam slam you to the ground and I knew deep down that this was it. He would kill you tonight, and I was going to stand there and let it happen.\n\nBut I couldn’t. So I ran down the hall, and threw open your door.\n\nTime seemed to stand still for all of us. I saw him on top of you, his hands squeezing tightly around your throat. I saw your own hands desperately trying to claw at him to no avail. I saw your heads turn to me. I had finally revealed myself, and your eyes widened in pure terror. You would’ve screamed had you been able to. Adam’s grip loosened as he gazed at me with bulging, bloodshot eyes. He swayed drunkenly, and his mouth flopped open uselessly as he tried to process my existence. You took that moment to kick him off of you, and that’s when I struck.\n\nWith a sickening roar I tackled Adam against the wall. I saw only red as I sunk my teeth into his neck. You both screamed as I chewed my way through his flesh. I dug my long fingers into his stomach, the only goal on my mind was to choke with him with his own innards so he could understand just a FRACTION of the pain you experienced. I tore them out and I FED THEM TO HIM AND I WRAPPED THEM AROUND HIS THROAT AND I BASHED HIS SKULL AGAINST THE WALL UNTIL HIS BRAIN SLID OUT OF HIS EARS AND I RIP AND TORE INTO HIS SKIN UNTIL IT WAS ALL GONE\n\nAND I BATHED IN HIS BLOOD\n\nI RIPPED HIS HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDERS\n\nI TORE HIS LIMBS OFF AND SHOVED THEM INTO THE HOLE IN HIS STOMACH \n\nAND I SCREECHED AND SNARLED AND ROARED LIKE A WILD ANIMAL AND I FELT JOY AT FINALLY TEARING HIM APART AND I LAUGHED AND CRIED AND HOLLERED \n\nAnd your terrified, bloodcurdling shriek of unbridled horror broke me out of it. The weight of what cruelty I inflicted dropped on me like a Boulder, and I could hardly breathe as my shaking hands rose to my eyes. I was covered in blood and viscera. The man who once might’ve been Adam was no longer recognizable. There was hardly anything left to identify anything akin to a body. I heard your sobs and I knew then and there that you viewed me as a monster. And I couldn’t refute that, for what civilized creature would lose all rational thought and reduce another living being chunks of flesh floating in a pool of blood? I was no more than a mindless beast, an untamed horror that wasn’t fit to live around humans. \n\nI wanted to explain all this to you. I wanted to beg you for forgiveness and try to be there for you. Yet when I approached you screeched for me to stay away, and I stood there frozen as you sprinted away from me and out of the house. \n\nAnd that brings us to here, Jessica. I’ve cleaned up the room and myself as best I could but my body still itches and I can’t stand to be in that room. I’ve given Adam a proper burial in the backyard. I understand he was a terrible man but even the worst of us don’t deserve a fate like that. Oh…yes, about that. I was surprised I could even step outside in the first place; it seems like the voice has disappeared from the shadows of the house. The air is so refreshingly cool and soft, Jessica. But…I won’t be leaving this house. I still don’t understand the hold it had on me but I think that it’s best that I give into it. A monster such as I has no place in the outside world, and I’ve made my peace with that.\n\nAnd that’s my story. I’m so, deeply sorry, Jessica. I know nothing I do could ever rid you of the mental scars I inflicted on you. I hope you’re safe, wherever you are. I hope you’re singing and dancing and laughing and enjoying your life for the precious gift it is. That, at least, brings me some comfort. As for myself, I’ll continue to stay in this house, feeding on the odd cockroach that wanders to close to me, endlessly pacing these halls until my feet are worn down to stumps. I’m frightened, yes. I’ll most likely be reduced to that dumb, lowly troglodyte once again, and that scares me. I don’t want to lose everything I’ve learned but I don’t believe I deserve any other fate. \n\nPlease, Jessica…forgive me. Because I cannot forgive myself.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10fnral/whimper_part_1/)\n\nPart 2\n\nI live a lifetime staring into those inverted eyes.\n\nIt’s like staring into a blob of tar burning without gravity. There’s a flame there, but there’s no urgency to it; it’s like a pair of flickers glowing behind stained and sooted glass. It’s not the white and blue flame of a torch cutting through me, it’s the steady flame of a wick telling me that it will smolder across the world if that’s what it takes to burn through me as well.\n\nThat lifetime ends, and my wendigo and I are running again. I’ve seen him, but he’s seen my tower, and I know where he’s running. He’s closer than my horizon, so I know I don’t have time. I have to turn around, I have to take three steps, I have to close the door and barricade it; I don’t have time.\n\nStill, I have to try. I’m already pushing off the ground as I turn for the door. It looks a mile away, but my body surges across the distance in only two steps, passing through the open arch with my third.\n\nMy binoculars are in my left hand, and the door is on my right. I grab the edge of the door with my right hand, and as soon as I’m past it, I throw it closed behind me, pressing hard from the soles of my feet to launch my body against the solid steel. I hear the latch set, and I reach up with my hand to turn the deadbolt.\n\n“I must already be dead.”\n\nThe words flash through my mind. With everything that Dianne told me, there’s no way that I was able to get back inside, there’s no way that I got that door closed, there’s no way that I’m still alive. \n\nMaybe that’s what hell is; an eternity of trying to protect yourself from the thing that already killed you. Maybe that’s what I am now; just the memory of a dead guy who tried to save himself.\n\nIf that’s what I am, I may as well get started. \n\nI think that I could barricade the door. I could knock over the refrigerator and shove it in front of the door. Then I could do the same with the washing machine. Then, if I still had time, I could shove the freezer from out in the garage in front of the door, too, along with that straight-piped Pontiac my grandpa always reminisced about.\n\n“You live in a tower, Rapunzel,” flashes through my mind, “you don’t own anything heavy.”\n\nI have a rifle, a bolt action .308 with a scope. I can drop deer, elk, bear if I have to with that rifle. It’s not going to help. I remember that, Dianne’s words repeating over and over in my head, growing clearer and clearer with every pass. The rifle is useless, death is its natural state, making it more dead won’t make it less dangerous.\n\n“You’re real brave now,” my handset chirps, Joel’s voice is responding to my lack of trust, “But you tell me how brave you feel when you're naked and a black bear is drooling while he stares at you from a nearby tree. Over.” I reach for the CB radio to turn it off, stretching to keep a hand on the door. I end up pushing it off the back of the table, but the illuminated display goes dark as the battery pack falls out of its slot. I slam my back into the door again, digging my feet into the floor and pleading with the concept of hope for an option.\n\nI can’t kill it. If I’m going to survive this, I’m going to have to take away its weapons. It’s faster than a bad thought, it’s stronger than the rock and the hard place, it’s hungrier than famine. I’m going to die, I won’t survive this, but if I’m going to try, then I’m going to have to try to take it apart.\n\nI try to plan, but I can’t focus; my mind is racing through a dozen questions at once. Joel’s words, “You’re real brave now …” and some other stuff after that. My mind thinks that it might just be something Joel knows how to do, then my mind tells me that’s stupid. My mind thinks that might have been Joel that I saw through my binoculars, then my mind tells me that’s stupid. My mind thinks that I need to get back to that whole “taking apart a wendigo” thing I was just thinking about.\n\nThere’s a machete on the side of my alice pack.\n\nI almost realize that when the world explodes.\n\nPart 3\n\nMy eyes are on the alice pack as my vision starts to spin. I feel my shins fold over my feet as the door explodes inward. My ear presses into my knee as my doubled body flips through the room. My eyes are still on the alice pack. \n\nMaybe, if I just could have gotten to that machete.\n\nThe alice pack is upside down and behind me as my back crashes into the table top. There are no legs underneath; it’s hinged to the inside of the wall to save space when not in use. Some of my ribs crack as my tumbling mess puts it to use.\n\nMy thighs crush into my chest for a fraction of a moment before bouncing off my lungs and springing back out on my hips. The backs of my legs shatter window glass on their way to colliding with the inside of a shutter, and then the whole mess of me falls straight down, onto my head, before plopping out sideways and neatly tucking in like a baseboard at the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe alice pack is gone, and I’m staring at the doorway. The door is still slamming open, a broad cannon shot of light punching it in. My mind must be failing; I’m hopeful that I’m only fighting against the light. I’ve never done that before. I don’t know what would make me think I could do it now. \n\nThe door bounces off the inside wall and starts to close again, and that’s when I see him; my wendigo. He sneaks in through the latch side of the doorway, like he’s ducking in behind a server when he’s not supposed to be in the kitchen. He’s rotating as he comes through the door, grabbing it with his hand and slamming it shut while he slides his body out of the way in a single, elegantly vicious movement.\n\nOne of the vegetable cans I had been stacking rolls in front of the door as he slams, and it bends in the bottom corner of the door as it latches. The triangular beam that shoots across the floor is my only remaining light. For an instant, I think to try and shoo it away, like it’s a fly trying to land on my face. I think it’s going to tell him right where I am.\n\nHe grabs the book shelf that sits just to the right of the door instead. It’s a three shelf thing that stands about hip high. It’s meant to stay out of the way of one of the windows so I’d have a better view. It’s made from leftover plywood that was brought up to finish the inside of the tower, and it has no back. My wendigo sets it in front of the door and holds it down as he tries to jam it into place with kicks.\n\nHe goes back for the books. I say books, but what I really mean is binders, like the three ring ones from school. They’re the same thing as the course material I had to study, left at my tower so I could be free to forget what I’d learned. There’s five of them, and they're all lightly filled. He grabs them by the spines and shoves them in the gap of the door jam in five places.\n\nI feel my chest trying to pull in air, but I don’t know if I’m breathing. I’m trying to understand why he would do that, why he would jam the doors. I’m trying to think of a reason that makes sense, one that makes it okay, because the only reason I can think of is that he doesn’t want me escaping. \n\nIf he thinks I can escape, that’s because he thinks this is going to take a while. \n\nMy triangular beam is still pointing across the floor, so I can still see as he cuts across the room to the left side of the door. He rips the bedding off the mattress and throws it behind him, back where the bookshelf had been, then he covers the bedding with the mattress. \n\nHe tries to pull the bedframe off the floor, but it’s hinged to the wall just like the table. He stumbles with it for a step, then he rips it loose from the hinges. He stabs the foot of the frame into the corner where the bookshelf and the door meet, then he jams the head of the frame into a beam under the roof.\n\nMy throat is burning. I think he’s going to use that to hang me.\n\nHe tears into my cupboards, shoving everything into those shelves by the door, before ripping the cupboards down and jamming them in front of the bookshelf. \n\nA strange thing is thought in my mind; he can’t see me. It’s not a helpful thought. I know he’s still going to find me. It’s a room on top of a tower; I’m either going to be right where he’s looking, or I’m going to be in the other spot.\n\nHe grabs the mattress and props it up in front of the shelving pile, and then he grabs the bedding that was underneath. He stands with his back to the pile and sits down. He presses his feet into the floor, and shoves his back into the mattress. He grabs one of my pillow cases and shoves a can in it before something catches his eye.\n\nHe locks eyes with me. He stops. His head cocks to the side like a puppy looking at a water fountain.\n\nWe are thoroughly confused.",

        "text": "I had always been fascinated by the idea of time travel. As a young man, I had big dreams and aspirations, but as I grew older, I found myself stuck in a dead-end job, with a failing marriage and no real purpose in life. I couldn't help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had made different choices. That's when the idea for the time machine came to me. I became obsessed with the idea of being able to go back in time and fix the mistakes I had made. I knew that it was a long shot, but I was determined to make it happen.\n\nI spent years studying physics and mathematics, trying to understand the intricacies of time travel. I poured all my time and energy into the project, sacrificing my job, my relationships, and my health. Finally, after years of hard work, I had built a working time machine. I sat in front of the machine, my heart pounding with excitement and fear. I knew that this was a momentous occasion, a turning point in history. I took a deep breath and flipped the switch.\n\nTo my amazement, the machine whirred to life, and I felt a rush of nausea as I was propelled through time. I had done it. I had built a time machine. I traveled back in time to my childhood years, determined to fix the mistakes that had led me down the path of unhappiness. I knew that I had to focus on my education, so I hit the books and studied harder than ever before. I was able to achieve great grades and landed a scholarship to a prestigious university. I also knew that my social life had been a problem for me, so I made an effort to make better friends and be more outgoing and confident. With these new friends, I was able to learn new skills and make valuable connections that would help me in the future. I also listened to my parents and took their advice. They were always there for me, and their guidance helped me make better decisions.\n\nBut one day, while I was walking back home from school, I saw what I thought was an outline of a very tall and somewhat deformed human-like creature. I brushed it off as a hallucination and continued my walk home. But as the months went by, I kept seeing the creature. I became determined to find out what it was. I started doing research, trying to find out if there were any historical records of this creature or if anyone else had ever encountered something similar. But I found nothing. I then searched deeper into the physics and mathematics of time travel and couldn't find any explanations. Eventually, desperate for answers, I delved into the world of the occult and discovered that the creature was a higher being designed to stop anyone from tampering with time, a safeguard to prevent catastrophic events from happening.\n\nI knew that the creature was not trying to communicate with me; it was a higher being sent to stop me from tampering with time. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that the creature was always watching me. It started to appear in my dreams, tormenting me with visions of me changing the past and causing chaos in the timeline. I tried to communicate with the creature, but it remained silent, only appearing to torment me in my dreams. I became paranoid, not being able to shake the feeling that the creature was always watching me. I knew that I had to stop using the time machine and accept the choices I made and learn from them, but the creature made it impossible for me to do so. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of trying to escape the creature's watchful gaze, and I knew that it would not rest until it succeeded in killing me. Every passing day has been making me feel more paranoid and I don’t believe I can handle it anymore so I have decided to give myself up to the creature. I believe this to be a warning to anyone capable of time travel, don’t do it or you’ll suffer the same fate as me.",

He turned to see his undead brother. “Jimmy?” Jimmy howled at Ethan and rose to his feet and towered over the still living sibling. \n\n“THEO, AIM FOR THE HEAD.” Theo did as was instructed. He raised the gun, took aim, and squeezed the trigger.\n\nBAM!\n\nJimmy’s head exploded sending chunks of his skull and brain and blood all over the surrounding area. Ethan got drenched in it. Jimmy’s body fell backwards. \n\nI heard Ethan begin to cry again. It was the second time in one day he’d watched his brother die. I turned to my friend and put my hand on his shoulder. In a twenty-four hour period we’d found out our mission was a fool's errand and lost five people. All of whom left this world with folks to mourn them.  Jimmy’s kids, now fatherless. And it was all my damn fault. Ethan looked up at me after another bout of crying. \n\n“Coop was right,” said Ethan. “We *are* fucked.” \n\nThat’s when it hit me. \n\n“Where… where the fuck is Coop?” Theo eyes widened. Ethan didn’t seem too bothered by the question, being that his focus was still on what remained of Jimmy. \n\n“What does it matter, we’re all gonna die here, man.”  \n\n“That doesn’t have to be true,” offered Theo. Ethan wasn’t having it. \n\n“Keep your fucking mouth shut, kid, or so help me God I’ll put a bullet through it.” Once again, I needed to calm the passions for the time being. At this point there was a higher chance of these two killing each other than a giant, or some kind of evil spirit doing the job.\n\n“Theo go check his tent, just to be safe. And whatever you do, don’t wander away from camp, please.” Theo nodded and headed over to camp. Then I turned my attention back to Ethan. \n\n“He saved your life twice today, E. I know the circumstances aren’t ideal, but you have to realize he made the right–” \n\n“He shot Jimmy, Frank!\" His eyes met mine. The tears that they bore ran as strong as the current beside us.  \n\n“I know. But you need to trust me, Ethan. He was gone. The threat here is much more than Giants now. It’s more than the elements. There is something  more sinister and  more powerful going on in this forest, and we need to stick together. We need to get out of these woods, man.\"\n\nEthan looked one more time at Jimmy. \n\nHis eyes narrowed. \n\n“What the fuck?” He laid Jimmy’s body down and moved to his midsection.  Then I saw what Ethan was looking at:\n\nThere was a huge circular lump in Jimmy’s right pocket. \n\nEthan reached into it and pulled out… what looked like a stone with some sort of weird, angular sigil carved into it. \n\n“When did Jimmy get this?” I shook my head. \n\n“I’ve never seen anything like that before.” The sigil looked like an eye made out of three triangles. Two to make up the outside of the eye, one upside down one to make up the pupil. Something about it rubbed me the wrong way. “You think he picked it off the ground somewhere?” \n\n“He might’ve… you think–” I finished Ethan’s thought for him. \n\n“It could be cursed?” He looked to his feet. The notion wasn’t that crazy after all the shit we’d seen. Theo had said it perfectly earlier. In these woods, everything we thought we knew means jack shit. \n\nSpeaking of Theo, it was during that shared silence that I heard him calling for us. \n\n“Frankie!” He and Coop came over. “He was sleeping.” *How the hell could he have slept through all of the chaos that just ensued?*  Coop got to us and I saw he had something in his hand. \n\n“Theo told me what happened, I don’t know how I missed all that fellas I’m sorry. I was having these crazy nightmares about–” He looked down at Jimmy’s near headless corpse and he turned green. “Jesus…” It was his eyes turn to water. “I can’t believe it… I’m so sorry this happened, E.”\n\n“Thanks Coop.” Cooper wiped a tear off his face with the hand that had the… thing… in it. \n\n“What do you have there in your hand?” Cooper brought himself back to the present. \n\n“Oh, I woke up with this fucking rock by my pillow and–” he opened his hand to reveal the same sigil on a different stone. “I thought you guys might’ve put this in there.” \n\n“Oh shit,” I said. Ethan lifted up the one he found with Jimmy. \n\n“This was in my brother’s pocket.” Cooper gave the stone a blank stare. \n\n“The fuck is it?” Ethan and I looked to one another. \n\n“I think it’s a curse.” \n\nWe let the other two in on our theory as we started another fire. We made the collective decision to stay up as a group till the sun came up. We weren’t sure if we were dealing with hoo doo or magic but we decided to keep an eye out for those stones. Jimmy’s possession and Coop’s paralyzing night terror were enough evidence to think they were bad juju and worth staying away from.  We tossed the stones in the river, and before we knew it, the sun had come up.\n\nEthan wanted to give his brother a proper goodbye. The kind that wouldn’t leave his remains out in the open to be the next meal for any sort of scavenger that might come by. We made a bed of twigs and sticks and laid Jimmy across it. Ethan cried through a eulogy he never thought he’d have to give. We all did too. After he said “I loved you” to Jimmy for the last time, he set his brother ablaze and we watched till all that was left of him was bones and ash. Then we packed up camp and headed into Third Canyon. \n\nThe ride wasn’t a crazy one, compared to Second Canyon’s rapids. It was a fast current, but a level one as well. We rode it for about nine hours and reached the mouth of Fourth Canyon. We’d only be about forty-five miles from the Nahanni River Butte, and three days away from a ride. \n\nWe pulled up onto the riverbank and worked on our tents together, looking over our shoulders, and jumping at the slightest creak in the woods behind us.  The remainder of this trip would be as damned as the first half of it. Our silence spoke volumes, but we were all thinking the same thing. \n\nWe’d come to this forest with hope.\n\nNo Issac.\n\nWe thought this trip would bring us together.\n\nNo Xavier\n\nNo Sauce.\n\nNo Desmond.\n\nWe thought we’d be able to come out of this on the other side.\n\nNo Jimmy. \n\nThe only thing we would be coming out of this forest with (IF we made it out of this forest) would be scars. Scars in our minds, on our bodies, and in our hearts. This search party had resulted in the loss of fathers, husbands, sons, friends, brothers… We had nothing to show for our efforts here in the Valley of Headless men. Just a couple of pitched tents that would probably hold four more corpses before the week was through. \n\nOur camp was set up and Theo made a fire.  The four of us sat around it, and Ethan stared into the flames, his eyes watering. \n\n“Jimmy wanted to make that pre-cooked Pad Thai tonight.” He sniffled. The sniffle became a whimper. Theo stood up. \n\n“I’ll get on dinner.” He made his way over to his tent and crawled inside. \n\nCooper put his arm around Ethan. \n\n“We’re almost out of here, E.” His sentiment was met with silent tears. I came to Ethan on the opposite side and we all sat there for a moment in embrace. The three of us had practically been brothers for what felt like eternity. The knowledge that I had brought them into harm's way tore me up inside. \n\nTheo came out of his tent with four pre-packaged meals, four bowls, and a kettle. He walked to the river, filled up the kettle, and walked back to the fire, facing us with his back to the forest. \n\n“I can’t wait to take a shower again man,” said Cooper. “I feel gross as fuck.” \n\nEthan ignored him again.  He wasn’t looking into the flames anymore. He seemed preoccupied with the sky… or another thought.\n\nThen I noticed that his eyes move down slowly as if he was tracking something.\n\nHis eyes jumped to Theo.\n\nThen back to tracking above him. \n\nI followed his gaze. \n\nI couldn’t make out what it was, but it looked like some… object… was slowly descending over Theo. \n\nEthan’s eyes narrowed.\n\nHe popped up, knocking me and Cooper off to the side. \n\n“Woah, bro, what are you doi–” before Cooper could finish his thought, Ethan jumped OVER the fire, pushed Theo to the side. \n\n“What the hell, Ethan?” asked Theo.\n\nEthan let the small… circular… object land gently in his hand. \n\n“What is that, E?” I asked. \n\nHis eyes widened. \n\nHe turned to us and held up the object for us to see. \n\nIt was one of the engraved eye stones we’d found on Jimmy. \n\n“Holy shit.” Theo’s mouth hung open. \n\n“It was floating towards you,” said Ethan. \n\nI was speechless. \n\n“Do you think they just floated into my tent and Jimmy’s pocket?” asked Cooper.\n\n“Looks that way, Coop.” I stood up and made my way to Ethan. “So we got another thing we have to keep an eye out for.”\n\n“Fucking floating rocks that make people go crazy and killer giants. Great. I was hoping I’d get to get some sleep to make up for last night but it doesn’t look like that’s happening.” Cooper shook his head. “Just our luck.” \n\n“What do you think is sending them here?” asked Theo. \n\nThe rock then shot out of Ethan’s hand like a bullet and headed straight into the woods. The ground began to rumble like it had two days ago. A guttural howl rung through the trees and the rumbling got louder and louder. \n\nI drew my gun, and the other three did the same. \n\nA familiar, hulking figure became more visible as it parted trees, making its way toward us. \n\n“If I had to guess,” I said. “They belong to that tall bastard from the other day…” \n\nAnd sure enough, out of the woods lumbered the ax-wielding Giant…\n\nOnly this time, he wasn’t alone. \n\nHe had two new tall friends with him.",
