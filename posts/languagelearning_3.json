        "text": "\nI noticed in biology class a few kids were talking to a girl about her learning English, what words she does and doesn't know, etc out of curiosity. Naturally, because I'm an eavesdropping eavesdropper, I eavesdrop. \n\nSo then I bring my computer over and am like \"what's your native language? What do you speak originally?\" In the back of my mind thinking \"gosh, it'd be really cool if she spoke Russian. Obviously she doesn't, no one speaks Russian in the US...\"\n\nAND GUESS WHAT SHE FREAKING SAYS SHE'S UKRAINIAN\n\nYOOOOOOO\n\nSo I was like \"Really? Well I know Russian!\" And thus sparked probably a 3 hour long conversation over the course of two classes and a lunch break in Russian, me speaking my extremely broken grammer and hardly understanding what she was saying because she spoke fast; and it was the greatest thing ever. I've never been able to actually use my second language in person, just over text; and while it was frustrating at how clumsy I was speaking and the plethora of words I didn't know, it is so exhilarating knowing that *I can actually communicate*. \n\nThis what I love about language learning, man. Two people with little to nothing in common except a language, and that's more than enough to spark a bond. \n\nI haven't studied Russian consistently in about 7 months at this point. I stopped during June because that's when I started to write a book, and then highschool started and I never fully recovered my learning habit. Especially in that conversation I could really feel how weak my proficiency has become. I was forgetting conjugations for subject pronouns ffs. By this point I'll probably need to backtrack like 5 months in my learning journey just to get back to where I was.\n\nSo anyway, yeah! Today was epic, and hopefully I can get back into the habit of studying. I have motivation, I just don't have enough motivation to prioritize Russian over the 5 other hobbies I'm trying to give my time to. We'll see if I can change that.",

It's worth noting that I already speak French, which should make the learning process easier.\n\nI have thought about the ideal learning roadmap, and I'm looking for feedback is regarding the following:\n\n\\- **Month 1:** basic pronunciation, Pimsleur, the most commonly used Spanish phrases and expressions, study basic Spanish grammar (subject pronouns, etc.)\n\n\\- **Month 2:** continue building out vocabulary, start practicing reading and writing in Spanish, work on grammar\n\n\\- **Month 3:** focus on more advanced vocabulary, find a Spanish tutor, focus on more advanced grammar concepts (past and future verb tenses, etc.), start watching tv shows in Spanish\n\n\\- **Month 4:** start reading books in Spanish, practice writing longer form texts, continue talking with tutor\n\nDoes this sound realistic? Is it ambitious enough? Too ambitious? Should I add something to this roadmap to practice? Any feedback is more than welcome! Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "This brief post could also be aptly titled \"The Effects of Personality and Temperament on Spoken  Language Proficiency\", but that's simply too long. \n\nWhat I wanted to describe with the title was the idea that displaying our language proficiency for others, whether they be teachers, language learners, or native speakers, depends a lot on our own internal conditions and personality, as well as on the strategies we use when speaking. (There's also a great book on this by Boris Shekhtman called [How to Improve Your Foreign Language Immediately](https://msipress.com/media/9781950328871-txt01.pdf), which provides lost of tips and strategies in this vein from an expert.) \n\nI can affirm this from my own experience: because of my temperament and preferences that have led over time to certain aptitudes, I have an extremely advanced level of writing. And yet you wouldn't always be able to infer that from my speaking, not because I lack vocabulary, but because my own tendencies (and in some sense bad habits) of processing, constructing, and filtering concepts with words lead me to take more time with things, or even to be too demanding with my own word choice. \n\nThis can lead to silences and hesitations that, without any kind of window into my own mind, can easily be interpreted as incompetence or drawing a blank. A jester, on the other hand, often has the opposite problem, but it's one much more favorable to conversation: since he's less demanding with himself in the expression, formulation, and choice of ideas and words, he's often verbally trigger-happy and can come off as fluent, maybe even brilliant. What this person lacks, however, is precision, complexity, a high degree of literacy in the target language, etc., that would convey more meaning with fewer words. \n\nThe ideal, of course, would be to combine the best of both worlds, so that you have both horsepower and fluency and can use them both according to the context. But unfortunately, like personality traits such as introversion and extraversion, as humans we tend toward one or the other without ever occupying one extreme entirely. And the best strategy, I think, is to work with what we have and improve it as much asa possible while recognizing our own unique strengths and weaknesses that we largely start out with and then build on as we gain proficiency. \n\nOn that note, I strongly reccomend the book above, since it's genuinely designed to enhance your speaking without changing your actual proficiency.",

But if they go to a hard video, and give it a particular rating, they might not know the difference between something like C1 and C2, and so that rating would be a lot less accurate. Should I make it so you can only rate videos that are your difficulty or lower? Should I add a separate button to say something like \"too difficult\" so they aren't just guessing a rating if they don't know?\n\nLooking for any kind of feedback, ideas, suggestions related to this app.",

I never learned it in school, or college, every time I look for tutors I’m directed to another online program, I spend hours upon hours pouring over my book(madrigals guide to Spanish) or duolingo and practicing with the people around me and every time I think I’m going to make a break through I just find out it’s wrong or too formal or only relevant in Spain.\n\nI have never felt so self conscious in my life. Every interaction I have I can go through a few back in fourths before I have to throw out “perdón, estoy aprendiendo español”. I want to make a life here, I have a wonderful partner here, but I walk through my life feeling like everyone who I meet will have to make accommodations for me. I feel like I’m not making any progress. I fear that I’ll never be able to communicate anything more complicated than simple needs.  I feel like this would have clicked if I was learning it when I was 18 but my brain just doesn’t work the same anymore.\n\nPlease, does anyone have any actionable advice? I keep getting the exact same advice when I talk to people here but every bilingual person here has been learning English since they were 6 and it’s really not comparable. \n\nSorry for the rant, thank you.",

        "text": "My language journey has not been consistent. I took 3 years of Spanish that spanned middle school and high school in the U.S. I have practiced on and off at work but have not held any deep or long conversations in it. Just phrases here and there. I lost a lot without practice and now I want to start studying again since I am done with school and will start my career. \n\nMy dilemma is that I also want to start seriously practicing Tagalog as well. I am half Filipino so I am familiar with hearing the language but did not grow up fluent, only using a few words. I can understand better than speaking and can pick up the context of a conversation. I also have the advantage of having family to practice with at home. \n\nWhen working, I will use a translator as I don’t foresee being completely comfortable providing care in any language other than English in a long time. A long term goal of mine is to be able to provide patient care in both English and Spanish as Spanish is a very helpful language to know in the medical field here in the U.S with many Spanish speaking patients. Hopefully be able to receive an actual certification of fluency for medical Spanish. Tagalog, at least from what I’ve seen, is not nearly as helpful in the medical field as many Filipino patients do know a degree of English as it is taught in the Philippines. \n\nMy dilemma is that I really do want to be fluent in a language that is a part of my culture. I want to be able to speak to the locals and family when I visit the Philippines. Tagalog has Spanish words and influence so there is some overlap between the languages especially with the Philippines’ history with Spain. \n\nAt the same time, I can’t overlook the usefulness of Spanish in my career. So I am not sure if I should first dedicate my time to only Spanish and then learn Tagalog or, and this is what I want, just studying both at the same time.\n\nHow much time should I dedicate to each language in a week? Am I too ambitious and unrealistic to do both at the same time? The reason I ask for advice is because I already have some foundation in both languages so it is not completely new to me. I appreciate any advice. TIA!",

        "text": "This question is more directed towards people whose native language uses grammatical cases, or those who speak one at an advanced level. I'm specifically starting to learn Russian and know a bit about German, but my question isn't specific to those languages.\n\nHow did you learn cases? Do kids native in those languages, one day, have to sit down and learn the whole table with all the different forms? I really have a hard time learning all that because my brain will just perceive it as an arbitrary list of random syllables, and with all the different forms for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, there are a lot of them. And even when I remember the forms, I'm always thinking \"okay, this is the case I should use, this is the 3rd column on the table, so I should use X\" it doesn't come by itself I have to really think about it.\n\nSo yeah, how do you make it intuitive, know what to use in all situations without thinking about it ? How did you learn this? Is the way really to sit down and learn the thing by heart at once? Obviously with practice it'll become easier, but I haven't managed to make it click yet.\nMy question is probably a bit stupid, I feel like it's just like the \"I can't remember genders/conjugations!\" kind of posts, and every time I read one of those I'm just like \"I don't know, that's just how it is!\" so I'm expecting receiving that kind of answers lol, but if you have any tips I'll be happy to hear that.

My level was close to C1, but without oral practice, it is now B1-B2.\n\n-English I hated all through high school.\nThen, at 15-16, I became a big fan of Jane Austen books and adaptations and started watching them in VOST, then watching all my movies in VOST. My English improved and at university I became interested in grammar and now I have a good level, for me. I can understand someone in a video without subtitles and read articles on the internet. The last time I had a conversation, I just had to understand myself a few times.\n\nI see a certain pattern but when I look at the different techniques and languages offered, I'm a bit confused.

        "author": "lolzmagic",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11nwsb3/how_i_learned_to_fluently_read_portuguese_in_8/",
        "text": "After about 8 months of practice, I can read Brazilian Portuguese fluently, listen with near fluency, and can't pronounce words correctly. My writing is poor and my speaking is atrocious. That's on purpose.\n\n**My Background**\n\nI have a personal interest in etymology. If you want to be a good writer, you either have to have it or study etymology. I'm no natural at understanding the nuance and magical nature of words, so I'm an obsessive user of wiktionary. My experience with etymology in my native language likely helped in my acquisition of a second language.\n\nI also took two years of HS Spanish (failed tests, got C's overall) and learned a small amount of Japanese grammar so I could understand machine translated Japanese better.\n\n**Approach**\n\nFluency in a language requires a wide array of skills. I made a choice to practice some skills and avoid others. As a result, I can read any book I pick up, but sound worse than a toddler when I speak. I have spent hundreds of hours learning the language and not even one hour was spent on my own pronunciation.\n\nWhy did I make this decision? I had a speech impediment when I was a kid and l'm very insecure about my pronunciation of words. I made a plan that would work for me, not a plan that would work for the *ideal* me. I would have dropped the language out of frustration if I practiced pronunciation within the first few months. With no plans to come to Brasil in the near future, didn't need to practice speaking.\n\nThis approach isn't for everyone. I made the right decision for myself but it will take a long time until I can speak fluently.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n- I started learning with the app Babbel\n- Within two weeks I started consuming media in Portuguese.\n- Within three weeks I took the free Speaking Brazilian Language School mini-course in pronunciation. Started watching her youtube videos as well\n- I started talking to people online once I finished the B1 Babbel course\n- After two days of struggling to talk to people online, I got the book Modern Brazilian Portuguese Grammar\n- I continued with Babbel until I finished it completely\n- For the last few months l've continued to consume media and talk to people online\n\nWhen I first started consuming media, I only tried to understand what the topic was. Eventually, consumed media where I understood about 40-85%. For videos/TV, I was at the lower end of the range. For books, I was at the higher end of the range. I only looked up words up that I didn't know about half the time at this point. I think knowing etymology helped here, since I could piece together a lot through context. Once I knew 85% of the words of high level books/shows/games, I would use the dictionary for every single word I didn't know.\n\nI have a lot of free time and I spent most of it learning Portuguese. Never kept track of hours spent. At least 2 hours a day in some form - including watching english shows with portuguese subtitles.\nIf Thad to pick a reason why Ilearned Portuguese so fast, I would say its because I allow my brain to have a lot of down time. I avoid being constantly online and being bombarded with information. Your brain needs time to process what it has learned. If you only have 30 minutes of quiet time in a day, don't try to cram more learning in. I often listen to music I know and like on my commutes rather than news or podcasts. Gives my brain a break. I have to operate in a way that works for me, not the *ideal* me.\n\n**Methods**\n\n- Babbel - 9/10\nI started with Babbel and didn't do any of the speaking. I would look up the definition of words after the lesson to see alternative meanings. I also found it important to focus on every word in their lessons. Trying to decipher sentences helped my learning a lot. All of my review sessions on Babbel were in Listening. I tried to piece together an entire sentence rather than just using key words to answer.\n\nAfter a couple tests, I noticed it marks your pronunciation as correct even if its wrong e.g. issues with the letters \"R\", \"L\", or saying \"ow\" instead of \"ão\". Wouldn't use it for speaking. Nice app other than that.\n\n- Speaking Brazilian Language School - 10/10\n\nI only consumed the free content and it is very nice :)\n\n- Talking to others online - 10/10\n\nI didn't realize how bad my understanding of the language was until tried to have comprehensible output. Output is so incredibly important and it should exist in your studies in some form. There are a lot of ways to talk to people. I mainly use discord, forums, and tinder. I am lagging far behind in this area and wish I put more time into it.\n\n- Modern Brazilian Portuguese Grammar - 10/10\n\nI looked things up in the book to help with conversations and once in a while I'd read a chapter in my spare time. Searching for specific scenarios was very easy\n\n- Watching TV - 7/10\n\nI watched a sizable amount of English tv with Portuguese subtitles. Trying to connect the subtitles to what was said was really helpful. The focus needed to do that is pretty high. I rewatched some anime but with Portuguese subtitles, that helped a lot since I already knew what was being discussed. I found Disney+ has a lot of Brazilian Portuguese dubs with closed captions, which helped me a lot. \n\nI probably learned the most through Brazilian reality tv. There was a lot of slang and differences in how people spoke. People spoke fast and with accents. I thought the show The Circle was tolerable. I disliked most shows.\n\n- Video games - 8/10\n\nI learned a lot by changing all of my video games to Portuguese. I didn't allow myself to play a single game in a language other than Portuguese (except for the new Pokémon game). I avoided any games that let me skip over learning Portuguese. Here are some games suggest\n\nCoffee Talk - Literally just dialogue. Cute game, makes you feel warm inside\n\nStardew Valley - Potentially a lot of dialogue, but you can avoid it. I stopped playing the game because I kept subconsciously avoiding dialogue\n\nDisco Elysium - GOAT, lot of dialogue, very interactive, and it was incredibly incredibly difficult to play in Portuguese. Of all activities, this probably helped me learn the most\n\n**tl;dr I learned in a way that worked best for me, not the ideal version of me. This approach isn't better than any other approach**",

        "text": "I seriously started taking lessons on Italki early January 2023. I am in Canada so I have been viewing lesson prices in CAD (Canadian dollar). I know when I top-up italki credits, they charge me fees and exchange rate variance, because it gets topped up in USD (US Dollar).\n\nSo when I viewed lesson at $17 CAD per hour and $14 USD got deducted. I Never really thought more about it.\n\nThis week , I decided to just pull out the calculator and check, and compare the actual exchange rates because the prices of the lessons went up $2\\~ for a $17 lesson. Now the same teacher's lessons are $19 CAD. I thought the teacher raised prices but all the teachers that I have favorited or use, all the prices were up similar ratio.\n\nIt seems NOW that the \"estimated\" local currency rates (CAD for me) are \"correct\" or \"accurate\".\n\nWhich means for month of January+February, I was actually paying around 10% more per lesson than what I thought. I thought I was paying $17.10 CAD, when in fact I was paying $19 CAD.\n\nExample:\n\nJan+Feb, I was viewing lesson cost at $17/hour and thought that's what I was paying. $14 USD was being deducted.\n\nDoing simple math, 17.10/14 = 1.22 (1 USD = 1.22CAD)\n\nNow in March since they updated, the lesson cost is shown as $19/hour and I am still paying $14 USD.\n\n19/14 = 1.35/1.36 ( 1 USD = 1.35 or 1.36 CAD). This is more accurate with today's exchange rate.\n\nThe problem is, 1 USD = 1.35 has been the rate for the past 5+ months. So why in JAN+FEB was I being shown \"estimates\" with a rate of 1.21?\n\nThe last time 1 USD = 1.22 was JUNE 2021. And for the past 5+ months USD/CAD has been at a rate of 1.33-1.38\n\nIt took them this long to update their \"estimations\"? So unless you were viewing the lessons in USD instead of your local currency, you were probably paying 10%+ more per lesson. \n\nObviously my fault as well for not pulling out the calculator the first time but glad I still noticed 2 months in.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI disputed with Italki, and their reply was a very generic lame exchange rate bla bla bla. I explained it's not the exchange rate variance but the fact their estimations of \"local currency\" are way off and outdated and it gives false sense of prices. They recommend to view lesson prices in USD.\n\nI will not be using Italki anymore and my suggestion to everyone is to view lesson prices in USD and not your local currency because you can't trust Italki with their \"estimations\".\n\nThis whole time I thought I was paying $17 CAD/hour when in reality I was paying $19 CAD/hour per lesson.\n\nNot only do I lose money in exchange rate+fees when topping-up but because I didn't check lessons in USD prices, I was seeing cheaper prices and didn't convert to check. Yes you can blame me for this too but their estimations shouldn't be this far off. They have updated the \"estimations\" now but it took them way too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Check lesson prices in USD when viewing teachers and make sure to convert USD to your local currency to see what you're actually paying. I was viewing lesson prices in my local currency (Canadian dollar) and it was understated by 10%. I should have converted the prices myself rather than trust Italki. Lesson learned and I will not be using Italki again because their solution is to view lesson prices in USD. Rather than admit they were either lazy with updating their estimations (to make students think they are paying less than they actually are, to make teachers prices seem more accurate) or because they intentionally delayed updating estimations to steal money. \n\nNo more Italki for me.",

        "text": "For several years now, I've been *obsessed* with language learning and \"exploring\" different languages. I have dabbled in over a dozen languages. Unfortunately, due to life and work stress, I usually fall short of my goals or lose motivation to continue whatever I set out to do. Earlier this year I put in about 40 hours learning Dutch. I really enjoyed it and regret stopping. Long story short, my job became way more stressful than it was in the past and I also shifted my focus to eating healthier and preparing most of my meals (this takes up a lot of my time in the morning before work). \n\nAnyway...I have a trip booked to visit Spain in about 6 months. I've been studying Spanish on and off for two decades. I'm 35 and started in 8th grade (around age 13)...yikes! I could get by in the language if needed, but I would love to reach a higher level to enjoy more native content (music, movies, tv shows, literature, podcasts, etc.) and to speak more confidently while in Spain. I think a minimum of an hour a day focused on Spanish will help me get where I want to be for the trip. I estimate my current level to be A2(ish). \n\nMy next focus is Thai. I've studied Thai a few years ago before going to Thailand for the second time. Well...I'd like to prepare for visit #3 to Thailand in early 2024 (January/February). I absolutely love the language, culture, music, food, etc. so there's plenty of motivation for me to learn. It may also be a future retirement spot for me. I have no issue with tones since I am musically inclined. I would like to spend at least an hour a day on Thai for about 6 months and then after the Spain trip, I can increase the time. \n\nLastly, Dutch and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig). As I previously mentioned, I started learning Dutch earlier this year, so I would like to start learning it again. I would really like to learn a bit of Scottish Gaelic as well since I have Scottish ancestry and I was supposed to start learning it at the beginning of the year. These two languages are lower priority, so my plan is to either do 30 minutes each a day or 1 hour every other day. I think it would be more manageable alternating between the two since three languages per day seems to be a better balance for me.\n\nThat's all...let me know your thoughts or suggestions. I have several resources for all four languages, but I appreciate any additional recommendations. Thanks!",

In total, **I received 101 completed responses**. **Respondents included language learners of 32 different foreign languages** with Japanese, English, Spanish, German, and French being the most studied languages among the participants. Notably, the survey included learners of several less commonly studied languages such as Esperanto, Turkish, Tagalog, along with 17 other languages that were studied by a single participant each. \n\n**The most common uses of ChatGPT for foreign language learning were:** **1. conversation practice (24.7%), 2. language learning material (18.8%), 3. vocabulary (17.8%), 4. grammar (12.8%), and 5. corrective feedback (8.9%)**. \n\nThe Likert items (5-point scale) were based on the two primary constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989): perceived usability (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). **TAM-based results were mixed**–participants were split on the PU of ChatGPT for foreign language learning while most respondents had favorable views of the PEOU of ChatGPT to learn a foreign language. \n\nSeveral themes were identified from the open-ended responses. **The most frequently commented on themes were: 1. Accuracy (52.4%), 2. Accessibility (21.7%), 3. Convenience (17.8%), 4. Limited usability (14.8%), and 5. Personalized language learning (8.9%).** The themes related to accuracy and accessibility were exhibited in both positive and negative ways. Specifically, four respondents remarked positively about ChatGPT accuracy while 49 had negative comments about the tool’s accuracy. For accessibility, 19 respondents’ comments were identified as positive and three were identified as negative. \n\nThanks again for your help and feel free to leave comments and questions below!",

For example, a Slovak friend of mine attended a Czech university and says she always spoke and wrote in Slovak and never had any problems or pushback from anyone. I don’t know the exact verbiage, but there’s a law in Slovakia saying that x% of music and tv on Slovak broadcasting needs to be either in Slovak *or* Czech. \n\nAre there any other countries that operate this way? I know Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia do their thing but I guess I’m curious about languages that are slightly further diverged from each other than BSC. Thanks!",

The only language I hear on a daily basis is pretty much just English and Spanish, but I’m not really close to anyone that speaks Spanish so I don’t have a reason to learn it.\n\nI also technically hear Japanese a lot, I watch anime and read a lot of Japanese books. Being the only language I took classes for, it’s the language I know the most with knowing Hiragana and Katakana along with some grammar. Covid hit right at the start of my second class and I haven’t been back to college since. Right now, Japanese would probably be the one language I’d have the most use for, even if it’s just for entertainment.\n\nThen there’s German, which I really want to learn because I just like speaking German. It’s a really nice language and as I was learning it, it was interesting seeing what English words I use all the time that originated from German. Although from what I’ve been told, most speakers in the US stick to English so I’d be hard pressed finding another speaker that wants to speak it with me.\n\nI do plan on moving soon, I’m moving to either Chicago or NYC with the most spoken languages there outside of English being Spanish and Chinese (and Polish in Chicago). \n\nIt’s hard to chose a language since I want to know a lot of them, but considering the lack of time I have, picking one to be fluent in works too. It’s just hard to pick just one for me.",

        "text": "The following is going to be quite theoretical, but I hope I’m getting at something regarding the nature of language learning.\n\nWhen an individual is presented with the grammar of a new language, they are faced with a learning task that involves pairing syntactic function with particles, declensions, conjugations etc. However, as we know, the very purpose of these declensions in language is to inform the message receiver of the syntactic functions of words. Therefore, the learner is confronted with a fundamental learning problem: the information about the function of words is only contained within the very things that they want to decode.\n\nTo solve this problem, the learner recruits contextual information and already existing language knowledge to infer syntactic function and then pairs it with the observed declensions. Over many such iterations, enough information is obtained in order to piece together the grammatical rules of the language.\n\nFrom this follows that the better the contextual information and existing knowledge, the more the person can infer from exposure to language and the more effective the process of grammar internalization.\n\nIn practice, this implies that actually turning grammatical rules into second nature is a dynamic process that is *strongly supported by the comprehensibility of the learning material*. An understandable text (in terms of vocabulary and declarative, but not yet intuitive knowledge of grammar) gives away the syntactic relationships between its component words by mere common sense, bypassing the fundamental problem discussed earlier. \n\nThat is, every iteration (say this corresponds to every sentence) will offer more in the way of syntactic function - declension pairs and thus effectiveness per iteration will increase. Moreover, the number of iterations per time unit will increase because one will read faster and will be exposed to more pairs per unit of time, once again promoting learning.\n\nI’ve been thinking that this may be why some of us (including myself) find that one gets good at reading before one fundamentally ‘gets’ grammar.",
