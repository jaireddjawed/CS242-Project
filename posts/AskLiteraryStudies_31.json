        "text": "A while ago I read an article that explored the connection between utopian or dystopian trends in literature and the economic state. The conclusion was that during hard times or recessions, literature was full of bright, utopian visions, while during times of expansion, literature went the other way. I remember McCarthy's *The Road* as somewhat of a case in point, being released during the last peak before the economy started going downhill.\n\nThe problem is, I can't find this article anywhere and I can't for my life remember where I read it (if it was a scholarly journal or, say, The Guardian). Any ideas?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, are there any good, thorough studies done on similar connection between literary trends and social circumstances? It could really be anything, subject matter, narrative techniques, semiotic trends, etc.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is doing research on this, I'd love to get in touch! I'm doing preliminary research for a potential Masters dissertation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThank you!",

Thank you so much!\n\n\n**long story**\n\nI go to school in the Netherlands. I am in my last year of what you call High School and I have to write a big project. The question I am trying to answer is\n\n\"Why does the English literature have more fantasy than the Dutch Literature?\" (i know it sounds stupid but I promise it sounds better in Dutch)\n\nIt is inspired by the fact that English literature is usually way more optimistic with magical elements, at least, compared to the Dutch literature.\nIn my experience, a lot of Dutch literature is :\n\n\"Man has a job and a wife. Something happens. Man loses said job and wife. Man goes on and complains about that for 300 pages. Man kills himself\"\n\nWhilst English literature often has more positivity, a better ending, and more mystical elements to it.\n\nSo for the first part of my research I need to know the definition of 'literature' and the definition of 'fantasy'. I already have both in Dutch, but not yet in English. The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms sounds like a good source, but I don't exactly have one lying around...\n\nThank you so much in advance!!\n",

The writings great obviously, my problem is I just can't seem to grasp any sort of subtly from the work like I could from the others. \n\n\n\nMacbeth just seems so straight forward. Macbeth is tempted to kill the king for power, he does so, things go bad. Lady Macbeth even summons the power of Satan to make sure this is done. There seems to be no ambiguity even before the assassination that killing Duncan is an objectively **bad** idea. Given the use of the witches, and also how nature itself seems in turmoil after the murder, Macbeth just seems to have such a clear sense of right and wrong and morality, and it makes the characters actions and desires feel so much less interesting. It's not like Julius Caesar where Brutus' downfall comes about from him attempting to do the right thing, or Hamlet where there isn't really a right or a wrong to begin with. Macbeth just seems to want power and he is willing to anything to accomplish that. \n\n\n",

But my main focus is the Italian language because French and me are not the best friends. \n\nSo I thought about some topics for my thesis in Italian literature and culture studies (because somehow there are not enough teachers for Italian linguistics at my uni to write my thesis in that field). I stumbled over topics like \"Dante in today's literature\" but then I thought about an English studies seminar I joined once. I had to write a term paper about Wells \"Time Machine\". So I thought there must be some Science Fiction culture in Italy, too. And this could be the thesis topic I'm finally really interested in.\n\nBut now I want your recommendations and what you know about this field. Should I better search for a better/similar topic (any tips what?). I just want to collect some ideas. Maybe be able to formulate a main theory and question on which I can build my thesis. \n\nI don't want to have headlines and precise topics what I could write about. Just ideas because I'm really unsure what to do since I can't write about a linguistics topic (that was my plan until yesterday I got to know probably every teacher of that field got a baby). I don't want the internet to do my homework of course! \n\nThanks a lot for every answer! (If you see any languages problems here and think \"well she can't even write English. How is she supposed to pass the thesis\" I will write in German and Italian ;) )\n\nLisa",

        "text": "Hey reddit's best sub!\n\n\nI'm writing a formal paper about 20 pages long and am currently in the process of trying to pinpoint my theoretical outlines and what methodology I intend to work with. In my reading of a certain literary work (here excluded because I'm quite certain you haven't read it, not trying to be hipster but it's a rather obscure Swedish text; also, somewhat jokingly, I'm scared of NSA), I intend to highlight how certain aspects of the text can be used to read others and how the text construes meaningful views on language, personal identity and its relation to the \"outer\" world. This sounds incredibly vague, but basically what I think would be a good justification for me to go on various related journeys of configurative reading could be Wolfgang Iser's theories of phenomenological reading. Basically I want to use his views on what a literary work is (i.e. something between the text and the individual reader), and justify my readings accordingly. I'm really not looking to do something revolutionary or extraordinarily complicated: I will be looking at various themes and analyze what different types of meaning they can yield in various configurations. All in all, a quite \"standard\" way of reading a text (I think?). I just want to ground it all soundly and rigorously so I can produce a serious and academic text to the extent which I can.\n\nSo that brings us to the questions at hand:\n\n1) Using Iser, is there some kind of complication I should be on the look out for, and discuss upon my treatment of him? Would some kind of Derrida/De Man-style deconstruction be opposed to him? (It's probably beginning to show how little I know...)\n\n2) According to the vague descriptions I gave you earlier, are there any other theoreticians you would recommend me looking into? Any related things to Iser? I heard that Richards might be good for doing thematic readings but I can't seem to find any texts of him that really fit the point; I'm not so sure a discussion of literary truth is incredibly relevant to my theory-section.\n\n\n\nOkay, the wall of text is finally over. \n\nBest regards,\nHansgreger",

Language is good for future travelling.\n\nI'm currently leaning towards French because:\n* close enough to Spanish that it'll come pretty quickly and be heaps easier than Chinese\n* even if I'm not particularly enchanted with French lit (other than Sartre, who's amazing), there is still a lot of important lit, philosophy, and literary theory in French\n*I know the head of the French dept. \n*People speak French lots of places, if I ever got to travel\n*it'll be easier to find random stuff I want to read/watch in French\n\nHowever, Chinese is still kind of appealing because\n*honestly so much more interesting than French.  seriously, everyone takes Spanish it's time for me to try something cool\n*our Chinese dept. is lots better than our French, even if that means it'll be lots harder.  I hate boring classes\n*Just because I don't know a lot of Chinese lit doesn't mean there's not tons of amazing, interesting stuff to be read, and I might have a unique perspective to offer a grad program\n*for actually working overseas, Chinese is objectively way better\n\nI would appreciate any advice!

        "text": "Hello. I'm looking for book recommendations, particularly works that focus on sex as very life-affirming. Stuff like Tropic of Cancer comes to mind, or The Unbearable Lightness of Being--however I haven't read these, so I'm not sure if they're what I'm looking for. I don't necessarily need a book that's heavy with sex scenes (though I certainly won't disqualify that). Perhaps I'm looking for something with a similar tone to Whitman's poetry (I've found the erotic tones in his words very inspiring e.g. from Song of Myself, section 7: \"Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale or discarded...\"), but all suggestions are welcome. \n\n\nTo be more specific: I'm one of the many in the USA who are \"recovering Christians\"--i.e. people who grew up in the church and then left it, due to lack of faith and/or the belief that the church taught the wrong things. Basically, I feel like I've moved on, but I still have a lot of trouble in my sexual relationships (not trying to get weird or anything) and deal with lingering feelings of guilt. I know that's sort of silly, but when you're constantly told sex is something shameful rather than beautiful, and your sex education isn't an education, but rather an abstinence-championing session full of disturbing rash pictures, then it may continue to grate on you into college years (like me). So, suggest away, please! Bonus points to books that also address sexual repression while also affirming sex.\n",

But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor  are  we  furnished  with  that  sufficiency  of  experiments  which  is  required  to an  accurate determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and elastic Spirit operates.\n\nI'm asking because I am unfamiliar with what Netwon's theological views were.

In particular, an indictment of how these things affect many of us who really have no better option than to suffer it. \n\nI have, predominantly, only been able to find literature and novels in this vein from the early 20th century. Indeed, from what I have found, the naturalist tradition in the US in the early 20th century appears to have been interested in the new hierarchy that emerged from a startling new economic reality dominated by massive corporations, the concept of corporate 'personhood', and the lack of ability to place blame for the actions of a corporation on any one person. As an example of this, one can see Norris's novel \"The Octopus: A Story of California\" and Don Passos's \"U.S.A\" trilogy, which I think fit into that tradition based on what I have read.\n\nI really have not been able to find any literature or novels about how authors deal with this today. Perhaps I'm searching in the wrong manner? In terms of fiction, I have already cited Saunders (albeit, my interpretation is subjective) and I believe Richard Powers's novel, \"Gain\", certainly stands out as a modern take on this (it is interesting to note how the concerns of American authors in the early 20th century differ from what Powers's seems to critique) but nothing else has yet popped up on my radar! I find it hard to believe that there has been no thought regarding this, or that there is not much fiction that concerns this, even tangentially.\n\nSo if anyone knows of literature written about this subject, or any modern fiction that deals with it, I would greatly appreciate it!",

He was a liar and he was a fraud. He pretended he had knowledge he did not have. He was a man of very high IQ. If he had put the time in to master the areas he should have, if he had really done The Inquisition, beginning by studying ancient history, by studying anthropology, studying political science, and being honest about his true influences, then I could respect him. I’m afraid people who admire Foucault feel the slick, glossy surface, and think that in some sense it’s depth, and it isn’t.\n\nI've also read a brief piece by her elsewhere criticizing what she sees as the abysmal scholarship of French theorists such as Foucault and Derrida. I find their ideas interesting, and many professors I've had reference their work, though I've talked to a few critical of post-structuralist and postmodern theory and they've said much of it is shoddy scholarship and fallacious in terms of logic (this seemed to be a divide between some of my Philosophy professors and English professors, with one Philosophy professor confessing that he admires the immense intellect of one of his English department colleague, but that he doesn't understand how he can give credence to some of these postmodern/post-structuralist theories).\n\nI guess this question has gotten a lot bigger than just Foucault and Paglia, but I'm just wondering if there really are such glaring objective errors and fallacies present in the works of Foucault (and perhaps others in his milieu) or if these are results of misreadings or misrepresentations on the part of those who are making the critiques. \n\nAnd I also understand that this is a massive can of worms.",

A quote from Cloud Atlas that I will probably use in my title: \"The weak are meat the strong do eat\".\n\nBtw, I've also had a think about books like 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Life of Pi' since they're also concerned with cannibalism but I think it might be straying a bit from my main topic.\n\nI've found a few studies already, but it's not been written on extensively, so I'm excited to get stuck in to the texts themselves. I know I could make a decent argument for it.\n\nWhat I need some help with is theoretical approaches! I want the main meat of my argument to obviously rely on the textual evidence, but I think some theory could help back me up. Do you know of any schools/writers/concepts/ideas I should pay attention to? To me, it sounds kind of Marxist in its approach; but I know that 'power' and 'capitalism' are such broad topics that pretty much every theoretical school discusses them, so I could do with narrowing it down a bit. \n\nAlso, just any help would be appreciated if you've come across anything (related to cannibalism in contemporary literature/related to any of the texts I want to look at, etc) that could be useful to my studies. \n\nThank you!\n\n",

        "text": "I've been re-reading Tolkien to my son lately and it seems like every time I go through it, I’m noticing things that Tolkien was pulling from other, older, half-forgotten sources (like Atlantis myths, or the word “ork,” or Irish ideas about the Tuatha De Danaan). \n\nBut it struck me that I don’t really know of any old folklore about walking trees. There’s the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis, the bodhi tree Buddha meditated under, Yggsdrasil… and there are trees that can bear fruit that affect folk-tale heroes. None of them are at all anthropomorphized. \n\nThere’s the *Golden Bough* thing about the yearly battle between the Oak King and the Holly King, and I suppose the Green Knight who wants Gawain’s head is an echo of that and thus sort of maybe tree-like. Maybe?\n\nI can think also of two bits of iconography – the [Green Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man) (which was apparently only named as such in 1939 – so after *Lord of the Rings* - and besides, often looks more like a salad than a spruce) and some [Arthur Rackham illustrations](http://www.fairyist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/calling-shapes-and-beckoning-shadows-dire.jpg), so out in the world around the time the book was being written. \n\n(There are also the apple-throwing trees in *The Wizard of Oz*, though they seem to be more of an intellectual joke from Baum than a descendant of some traditional fairy creature.) \n\nAm I missing something? Are ents more Tolkien-made than they seem? Or do they have folkloric ancestors somewhere else?   \n",

        "text": "I find that Young Adult Literature as a genre is often marginalised in scholarly thought however I maintain that it is a vital breeding ground and experimental place where fiction can explore concepts that are just as literary as that of Adult fiction. \n\nI'm looking into how fantasy novels (particularly the Harry Potter series and His Dark Materials trilogy) use fantasy to explore the Bildungsroman genre but I'm finding it hard to unearth decent critical material and ideas. Here are some questions to get the discussion going, but I am interested in anything anyone has to say or recommend to read on the topic! Thank you for taking the time to read this!\n\n1. How do Young Adult novels deal with the purgatory space that is young adulthood? Is it portrayed as a positive or negative space? \n2. Why does so much YA literature veer to the dark end of the spectrum in subject matter?\n3. How has YA literature developed over time?\n4. Does YA tend to focus on teens overcoming a system?\n5. How is the quest for identity portrayed in YA lit?\n6. Has University extended this period of artificial childhood? Is that why we are seeing emerging publishing categories like the New Adult genre?\n7. How does fan fiction and social media effect the literary authority of the novel?\n8. How does fantasy engage with YA literature differently from literature written for adults?\n9. How are young people presented and produced within the Harry Potter series and His Dark Materials? e.g.. Lyra vs Harry Potter",
