        "text": "So, I'm still waiting for the game to go on sale before I buy and replay it in full in order to give it a true analysis, but given the [recent breakdown of the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9es3gt/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/) by /u/VestigialLlama4, I thought I'd take the opportunity to write down a handful of things that I remember.\n\n**Wheeled Vehicles and Middle Eastern Society**\n\nThe game opens in Masyaf, Syria with Ezio in search of an ancient Assassin library. There he encounters an army of Templars, and Ezio pursues and kills their leader after he [attempts to flee via carriage](https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611998-assassin-s-creed-revelations-windows-screenshot-carriage-chase.png). The problem here is pretty straightforward: there were no horse-drawn carriages to speak of in the Middle East (nor was there a road network to support them). In a famous study by Richard Bulliet (*The Camel and the Wheel*, 1975) he demonstrated that improved camel harnessing and the economical nature of its use caused camel transport to displace wheeled vehicles in the Middle East and North Africa beginning in the late Roman period, a process which was largely complete by the time of the Islamic conquest. Wheeled vehicles did not displace the camel again until the advent of motorization. Bulliet produces a couple of quotes by European travelers in the eighteenth century pertaining to Syria in particular: \"it is noteworthy that in the whole of Syria no wagon or cart is seen,\" and \"[the camel] is of infinite use in a country... where, except a clumsy kind of cart, sometimes used for transporting large stones, wheel carriages are in a manner unknown.\" (page 8)\n\n**Guards in Istanbul**\n\nIn Istanbul, the Ottomans have regular soldiers who serve as guards, while the famous Janissaries serve as the elite soldiers and are particularly active in guarding the imperial palace. In reality it was the Janissaries who acted as Istanbul's regular police and guards, while the palace was guarded primarily by the [*bostancı*s](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Bostanc%C4%B1_guard.jpg), or \"gardeners,\" as well as other palace military staff. I assume that Ubisoft's presentation was a result of the Janissaries' fame, requiring them to be the special, elite troops (this may also explain their ridiculous outfits). But let's remember that the Janissaries were never a small force, they numbered approximately 8-10,000 men at this time. On the Janissaries and their role: İsmail Hakkı Uzunçarşılı, *Osmanlı Teşkilatından Kapukulu Ocakları*, vol. 1. Sorry that it's not an English source!\n\n\n**Galleys and Galleons**\n\nThere seems to be a recurring tendency in all sorts of media to depict all ships from the beginning of the gunpowder age onward as 17th- and 18th-century Atlantic galleons and ships-of-the-line. A little more than halfway through the game, Ezio has to escape Istanbul and get to Cappadocia in order to pursue the Templars there (I admit I can't remember the specific reason). After demolishing Istanbul's harbor, Ezio escapes on a ship with Piri Reis. Not a galley as the Ottomans used, but a full-fledged galleon, complete with hinged gunports along the lower decks, something which had just been newly invented in Atlantic Europe right about the time the game takes place. The Ottomans didn't use galleons at all in 1512, but they had experimented with some previously - [here is a depiction from 1499.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Battle_of_Zonchio_1499.jpg) As you can see, all the cannons are positioned on the upper decks. What happens next is the amazing part - Ezio and Piri Reis sail to Cappadocia. Yes, *[sail](https://i.imgur.com/2JuXHdq.png) to [Cappadocia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Nev%C5%9Fehir_in_Turkey.svg/1579px-Nev%C5%9Fehir_in_Turkey.svg.png)*, in the middle of Anatolia, not on any navigable rivers, in a *wind-powered galleon.* Truly Piri Reis was a navigator to be admired... and feared.\n\nOn Ottoman sailing vessels in this period, see John Guilmartin, *Gunpowder and Galleys*, 1974.",

        "text": "This is a short and simple one but I haven't found it here yet, so I thought I'd give it a try. Do be kind, it’s my first post here.\n\nIn that seminal work *Die Hard* (1988), the late Alan Rickman as the ~~terrorist~~ thief Hans Gruber [delivers the quoted line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUvkF8lk1qI), implicitly comparing himself to Alexander the Great with regards to the heist he's about to pull off, adding \"the benefits of a classical education\".\n\nIn some badhistory of its own, it's sometimes cited that the movie invented the quote out of the air, when in fact there are precedents from the 18th century onwards, with the general idea mentioned in the *[The Way of the World](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Way_of_the_World/Act_II#SCENE_III.)* (Act II Scene 3) by William Congreve, printed in 1700, then paralleled in \"[Why Alexander Wept](http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&amp;book=thirty&amp;story=alexander&amp;PHPSESSID=6906dddc188ece52252f843b544aa365)\", in *Thirty More Stories Retold* by James Baldwin in 1905, and \"[Of Late I Think of Cliffordville](http://twilightzonemuseum.com/media/cliffordville.php)\", *The Twilight Zone* (S4E14) in 1963. All of them carry the same connotation - a man is unsatisfied once he gets everything he wants.\n\nSo if this saying didn't originate in antiquity, does it have a kernel therein at the very least? The answer is yes, and it is indeed Plutarch, part of any healthy classical education. But Hans was probably snoozing through that lesson, because the *Moralia* [instead says this](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_tranquillitate_animi*.html#ref31):\n\n&gt;Alexander wept when he heard [Anaxarchus](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Anaxarchus) discourse about an infinite number of worlds, and when his friends inquired what ailed him, \"Is it not worthy of tears,\" he said, \"that, when the number of worlds is infinite, we have not yet become lords of a single one?\n\nThis seems to be a polar opposite to what's being propounded in the quote: Alexander is complaining because he *hasn't* actually conquered the world, and even if he did, he'd never get to conquer any others unless he waited for Hero of Alexandria to invent the rocket ship. But then again, both would lead to the same end result even if he'd conquered the world; he'd have nothing left to do. Take that as you will.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Baldwin, J., 1905.

        "text": "I started this series with [UNITY](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins_creed_unity_a_near_complete_list_of/), then went to [AC1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dq6uy/historical_inaccuracy_in_assassins_creed_series/), [AC2](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dzdbq/historical_inaccuracies_in_assassins_creed_series/), [Brotherhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9efp0k/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/), and now Revelations, which I am going to engage with the history and context, to measure its efficacy as recreation, draw up lacunae, the weird tension between history and fiction underpinning it.\n\nRevelations is pretty interesting.  **It has two stories and two settings and two protagonists**. We have **Ezio in Constantinople**, and we have **Altair in Masyaf**. The game is an epilogue for both characters, and its a bit like The Godfather II where you intercut two stories and two periods at once. **I am going to do Altair's Campaign first, because it's shorter. And it's self-contained** internally, with little carryover to Ezio's story aside from some McGuffin. Originally, Ubisoft planned to have Altair in Constantinople in the period before and during the Fourth Crusade and try and put across the city in its Byzantine Height, before the Crusaders gutted it, and contrast that with the city revived under the Ottomans. And let me say, that is still a pretty awesome idea and worth doing again and it's a huge missed opportunity not to see the city before the Fourth Crusade destroyed it, and seeing the Fourth Crusade itself would have been amazing and horrifying. That said I am actually grateful because that means I only have to read up on Istanbul in a single year and during the Ottoman Revival under the Bayezid era.\n\n**ALTAIR'S CAMPAIGN \\[1190-1257 AD/CE\\]**\n\nAltair's campaign is interesting because each sequence jumps forward in time, making real time jumps that is kind of disconcerting. But it's a good experimental idea and I'd like to see more of that to be honest, just done better.\n\n\\- The first sequence shows us Altair Pre-AC1, and it has an Assassin turned Crusading Knight which is fictional but again is a reprise of my complaint from the article on AC1 where the games give the impression of the Asasiyun being anti-Crusader when they were mainly attacking Saracens and were often allied with, or aligned with, the Crusading army.\n\n\\- The second sequence sets up Altair's conflict with Abbas Sofian. The big issue is the cremation of Al Mualim which the Assassins treat as \"blasphemy\". That's weird because AC1 had lent into them being secretly secular humanists, and now they are treating cremation as some blasphemy. Altair's reasons for cremating the body make little sense since he thinks that the Apple might still bring him back from the dead somehow but why he would believe that makes no sense even in the fictional schema.\n\n\\- The entire civil war between Altair and Abbas Sofian is fictional. The historical part, i.e. the implication that Abbas Sofian took the Asasiyun in a darker path but there's no record of any such thing happening in the period of 1200-1250 when the Assassins were still a thing. There's no record of them becoming darker, tyrannical, or worse than they ever were.\n\n\\- The final sequence has Altair meeting Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, father and uncle of Marco Polo. The most significant association was when Marco Polo met the Assassins and lived with them. And Marco Polo's book is not complementary to the Assassins, so I don't know why the games want Altair and the Polo family to be \"bros\".\n\n\\- **The big issue and again the final part of the Syrian Assassins appropriating the Iranian Assassins history in the game** is the end. Altair shuts down the Masyaf branch and tells the order to go into hiding and so on. The Mongols arrive and this is treated as the end of the Assassins. **In reality, Hulagu Khan attacked and destroyed the Iranian Assassins at Alamut in Iran, and not Masyaf in Syria**. Masyaf didn't fall to the Mongols and certainly not in 1257. The Mongols did come to that part of Syria in 1260 but they never fully conquered and destroyed the Syrian Assassins. **In fact, the Syrian Assassins would continue until the 1300s when they became vassals and puppets of the Mamluk Sultan Baibars and his successors**.\n\nSo once again the game doubles down on the disinformation from AC1. Makes the Syrian Assassins a bigger deal than they were, and more heroic than they were. Anyway, off to Constantinople.\n\n**EZIO'S CAMPAIGN \\[1511-1512 AD/CE\\]**\n\n***Setting:*** *Constantinople/Konstantiniye*/*Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire, in the reign of Sultan Bayezid II*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 1 - 3*\n\nSequence 1 is set in Masyaf and there isn't much to add except that at this time (1511) it was still under Mamluk rule. The Ottomans would take over in 1516. Here we see Byzantine Greeks who are fictional holdouts against the Ottomans (and also Templars). **Now for the big and obvious one. The Eastern Roman Empire was never known as Byzantine** by themselves, by the Ottomans, and by its contemporaries **until the German historian Hieronymous Wolf coined it in 1557** and that was still used entirely in the West and was unknown to the East until the 19th Century or so, during the Revival of Greek Nationalism. The so-called Byzantines would call themselves Roman.  I actually do sort-of agree with designating the Byzantines as a separate offshoot of the Roman Empire and not entirely Roman, so I prefer the term Eastern Roman Empire myself. **On the other hand, the multiple names for the city is accurate. As is the idea that Istanbul was in fact a much older slang name for the city dating to the Pre-Ottoman era and not as many neo-Byzantines on the internet and academia see it, as some new thing entirely made up.** The Ottomans called it Konstantiniye, in Turkish, never once denying credit to the the Roman Emperor Constantine. So that part is accurate in this game.\n\n**We meet Prince Suleiman, the future Kanuni (Lawgiver), in his pre-ascension days**. He was famous for speaking multiple languages, but him speaking Italian, leave alone Florentine dialect is not recorded, but it's not unlikely given that, as the rather accurate database (written in-universe by the much-missed Subject 16) states, the Ottomans did conduct diplomatic relations with the Florentines, first under Lorenzo de'Medici (Faith Mehmed actually extradited Pazzi conspirators to Florence for their execution as a favor to Il Magnifico) and then to the Republic (the bit in the database about them consulting Leonardo for a bridge over the Golden Horn did happen, though it never came to pass). It's just that given the Ottoman wars with the Venetians, I kind of assumed that they would know Venetian dialect. **The game doesn't do a whole lot with Suleiman, he's mostly here as \"the good guy Ottoman\" as is Piri Reis.** We meet Reis during the period of study leave he had in-between naval commands. He was indeed a great cartographer. Though him being some kind of bomb expert seems a stretch. The Ottomans indeed had a sophistication about gunpowder but the kind of bombing craft we see in the game seems a little too cute and arcade-y.\n\nA number of posters in my previous posts over at r/badhistory have been waiting for the roasting of the Janissaries in the game. Let me not disappoint. **The outfits of they wear, especially this bizarre gold-plated mask, seems to be derived from Zack Snyder's Immortals in the movie 300**. This probably reflects the weird fascination many historians both in the past and present have for the Janissaries, slave children indoctrinated by religion and ideology to be entirely loyal to the Ottoman Sultan and no one else, though in practise that often led to the tail wagging the dog as we see later in the game.\n\n(EDIT: For more info on the Janissaries, u/Chamboz has a new post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9ewy18/some\\_thoughts\\_on\\_ac\\_revelations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9ewy18/some_thoughts_on_ac_revelations/)) on them).\n\nAt r/badhistory [**u/cuc\\_AOE**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cuc_AOE/)  [brought to my attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/73xces/assassins_creed_ii_and_the_erasure_of_womens/) a post by [**u/Chamboz**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Chamboz) which talks about AC2 and Brotherhood dealt with prostitution as this faction called \"courtesans\" and how that was absurd and offensive. I am now going to say that Ubisoft have gone one step lower in Revelations. You see the Ezio games have these factions you can use as distraction agents in the open world: Mercenaries who can fight for you, Courtesans who are...sigh...distractions, as are thieves who also distract soldiers and get them to chase after them. In Constantinople, we have Mercenaries, and we have thieves, but **the role of prostitutes are played by Romani people**. In this game we see Roma being sent and dispatched as distractons, where they would flirt with guards, play music and so on, while Ezio sneaks behind them. The Roma are the only significant ethnic minority in the Ezio games to be represented directly, and yet the games make them into a joke, while also scanting their real precarious history in the city. The Romani people still face real persecution in Europe and it's kind of absurd that this is what the game brought up.\n\n**Sequence Three ends with us attacking Vali cel Tradat**, an Assassin-turned-Templar. I don't know if that name is orthographically correct or not, but **a Wallachian loyalist to Vlad Tepes** makes me question why he is attacking the Assassins rather than Vlad's brother Radu the Handsome, an Ottoman client and his descendants. **It's also anachronistic because the idea of Vlad the Impaler as being this hero for the Romanians or Wallachians, as Vali cel Tradat claims in his conversation and database, is a 19th Century phenomenon**, dreamed up by Romanian nationalists and perpetuated in the Communist regime because you know a guy who murders Turks and keeps the invaders out and defending a \"Christian Europe\" or killing in the greater good is music to the ears of nationalists and Nicolae Ceausescu both. Before the 19th Century, there is not a shred of evidence that the Romanians even cared for Vlad in any way. Certainly not in the Ottoman era. **Of course the open-world references to Vlad by the town criers and street preachers seems right, because he was indeed a popular boogeyman figure after his death**.\n\nStill Vali introduces the overall theme which has the Assassins openly allying with the Ottomans, and the Templars finding members among the people the Ottomans oppress. In fairness, the Assassins supporting Lorenzo de'Medici makes just as much or as little sense, as does supporting Pope Julius II, at least de-facto. It's just that the Ottomans ruled a real empire and on a bigger scale, and them being a \"good empire\", and the existence of any such thing, is questionable and obviously false. I'm an anti-Orientalist myself and I agree that the Ottomans often get a bad rap but they were still an empire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 4-6*\n\nThis is the part where the game goes to Prince Suleiman's banquet, and we meet Prince Ahmet, Tarik Barleti, captain of the Janisarries. **This part gives an accurate impression of the fratricidal nature of Ottoman Succession** (also common across a number of Central Asian, Persian kingdoms, and especially in Mughal India). \"When the Sultan sneezes, the Princes draw swords\" is how it went down. Islamic Law apparently said that a King choosing someone as a successor went against religious principles since it basically singled out one kid as destined for the throne and so implied some divine favor which was not in the text. So that meant succession struggles were \"open season\" and Fatih Mehmed put a law saying that *it was legal for a Prince to kill his brother* and his family and succeed, provided he won.  **The political stuff in the Ahmet v. Selim showdown seems interesting in that Ahmet is leaning to Europe while Selim is leaning to Asia.** And historically Selim the Grim (no seriously that was his epithet) expanded the Empire's domains in North Africa and the Middle East. Tarik Barleti seems fictional but he is, according to his biography, a Greek slave turned Ottoman supremacist. So that seems plausible since the Janissary indoctrination seems to have produced little defection from what I've gathered. **The Janissaries having their own imperial ideology, pushing their own agenda, and them being kingmakers is pretty spot-on.** Bayezid II himself came to power because the Janissaries backed him. In his reign, he was geared toward making sure that the Janissaries weren't getting too powerful and so balanced other institutions against them, but this irritated the Janissaries even more, especially because Bayezid II was trying to consolidate given the weak economy left to him by Fatih Mehmed's conquests.\n\nThe Riot at Theodosius Harbor is entirely fictional and I find it weird that Ottoman Assassins are willing to let an Italian dude order them to throw some of their own citizens under the bus for the sake of a single eavesdrop mission. It's just off. **We also get to meet Manuel Palaiologos**, heir apparent to the old Eastern Roman title. **In real history, Palaiologos wasn't this Bonnie Prince Charlie type** trying to get back the throne and secretly skulking around the Ottoman Empire. **He actually accepted the Ottoman Empire, successfully petitioned Faith Mehmed to live in the city**, and he retired and lived in the Ottoman era Konstantiniye without any fuss, **putting himself entirely in the mercy of the Ottomans in the best of faith** and he lived and died without fuss, his presence undoubtedly legitimizing the Ottomans among their Greek subjects.\n\nThen Ezio goes off to Cappadoccia but not before unleashing another battle in the harbour where he uses Greek Fire. I am not sure if Greek Fire was available to the Ottomans, and I don't know why Ezio hates the Ottoman harbour and navy  so much. First he starts a riot, now he's burning down boats, breaking the chain boom and so on. Is he trying to intentionally damage the Empire's sea trade?\n\n(EDIT: **Speaking of \"sailing to Cappadoccia\"** u/Chamboz **pointed out the absurdity of sailing to a place landlocked in Anatolia, in what is Central Turkey in contemporary times. This is one of Ubisoft's greatest geographical howlers**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 6-9*\n\nThis part of the game takes place in Derinkuyu, Cappadoccia. Picturesque, mountainous, and unusual. Historically it was used as a cave to holdout against the Ottomans so that part is legit.\n\nWe meet Shahkulu. The real Shah Qoli (Turkicized into Sahkulu or Shahkulu) was the leader of a Pro-Shia Turcoman ethnic rebellion against the largely Sunni majority Ottoman. Since the Ottomans were contesting the rising Shia power of the Safavids, Shia within their domains got a rough time. Which makes it weird that the Assassins are fighting them because historically the Assassins originated as a Shia sect and while they fought other Shia sects, and Shia officials, they finally aligned with the Crusaders to put a stop on the Sunni resurgence under Saladin. At the very least Ezio and Shahkulu should drop a line or two about this. Prince Ahmet was sent to put down the Shahkulu rebellion and he in turn tried to recruit them to fight Selim so that part is right. It's just that he probably did it for self-interest more than anything else.\n\nThe only problem is that the Sahkulu rebellion took place mainly in Southern Turkey in the Taurus mountains and not in Cappadoccia which is in Central Turkey.\n\nIn the end, we see Sultan Selim the Grim strangle his own brother. He didn't do it personally. He ordered his execution and so on. But yeah that's what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**\n\n\\- REVELATIONS is a game that is very arcade-y. You have ziplining, workable Leonardo parachutes, and at the end we have parasailing. So it's a pretty silly game. **Nonetheless, compared to Brotherhood with its totally absurd caricature of Roman politics, I actually do think that Revelations gives an accurate impression of parts of Ottoman Turkey**. We get to see in the game's plot how an Ottoman succession crisis played out, with brother killing brother, we see the Janissaries as these imperialist with their Ottoman manifest destiny. And **the way foreign policy intersected with palace politics is actually quite deftly and economically done**. This shows the strength of its writer Darby McDevitt who unlike other AC writers actually writes a huge chunk of the game (Main game, side missions, database) and who actually does like getting the history right (he wrote Black Flag).\n\n\\- Ziplining across Istanbul is stupid but I actually think it fits. It does manage to convey the hilly topography of Istanbul. The whole Parachute mechanic which is also silly works because the skyline of Istanbul and the elevation makes it a fairly practical way to get around. The city itself is very touristy, i.e. it tries to convey the picture post-card city rather than the city of that time. So for instance we have Hagia Sophia with all its minarets when it had ~~two~~ one at the time. The interiors of Hagia Sophia which we play in an optional mission shows it during the current restoration after the Mosque was converted to a museum. \n\nEDIT u/Anthemius_Augustus says more, and I will quote him:\n\n&gt;I'm suprised you didn't talk about how inaccurate Constantinople was in this game. The accuracy is far, far below the bar that AC2 and Brotherhood set, and it is probably a result of the games short development cycle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It seems that after they were done with Galata, the Topkapi Palace and the Hagia Sophia they didn't have time for more so they just reused assets as much as possible to have a satisfactory city.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The most glaring mistake is that the Hagia Sophia is in its present state, with 4 minarets. Whereas during the time of the game there would have only been 1 minaret. However concept art does show a more accurate portrayal so I suspect this was a concious decision and not a mistake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**However the rest of the city has far more glaring mistakes.** For example **plenty of monuments are in the completely wrong spot**, **the Forum of Constantine is located inside the former Great Palace for some reason, instead of by the Grand Bazaar. The Grand Bazaar itself is portrayed in its present stone condition, whereas in the 16th Century it would have been made of wood.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...[Zeyrek Mosque](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/7/76/Zeyrek_Mosque_Database_image.png/revision/latest?cb=20111203194233) looks nothing like it does in [real life](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Image-ZeyrekCamii20061230_02.jpg/1200px-Image-ZeyrekCamii20061230_02.jpg), neither does the [Rose Mosque](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/d/dc/Rose_Mosque_Database_image.png/revision/latest?cb=20111203194157) look like it does in [real life](https://78.media.tumblr.com/f4dabb43e7831d6ca7a15fa34d1d94b3/tumblr_o618oah2UP1tmm2yno1_1280.jpg), not even the [Hagia Eirene](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/5/59/Hagia_Eirene_Database_image.png/revision/latest?cb=20111203194803), the 2nd largest Byzantine landmark in Istanbul looks even remotely like it does in [real life](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Istanbul_Hagia_Irene_IMG_8067_1920.jpg/1200px-Istanbul_Hagia_Irene_IMG_8067_1920.jpg). It is all just the same copy-paste crap. Which makes me wonder why they even included database entries for landmarks that they didn't even represent?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now you might say that I am having pretty unrealistic expectations for a video game, but I would argue otherwise. **AC2 and Brotherhood, while the cities were scaled down was fairly accurate in terms of how landmarks look and roughly where they are located. Revelations doesn't,** for whatever reason, probably due to development time. But it is massively distracting when playing the game if you have a decent understanding of Constantinople's geography.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **This is going to be a running gag for regulars** but the next one is the New World, and after Revelations, the next European games are Unity (which I covered), and Syndicate (which actually does have Jewish characters in Marx and Disraeli). **But again Istanbul from 1492** to the time Ezio arrived, **hosted the largest Jewish community in Europe**, and as such there definitely should be Jewish characters prominently featured in the game. I wish the games included them simply because there needs to be some believable reason for the Assassins to support the Ottomans. Within the game, the story keeps rubbing in the Assassin's face about how the Templars are recruited from places the Assassins conquered. We also see Romani treated as marginalized but if we see Jewish characters flourishing we can appreciate, I feel, the tolerant quote unquote, side of the Ottomans. That's a little exaggerated and romanticized I think but it's there nonetheless and it would at least get us to accept it, if not entirely support or condone it.\n\n\\- The Renaissance games scanted the issue of slavery in AC2 especially in Florence and Venice, and vague side missions in Brotherhood implied that it was stuff that only the Borgia did rather than common across the nobility. Slavery is acknowledged at the very least in *Revelations* as a feature of Ottoman society. But we again only see the Janisarries, when there were other kinds of slaves across the Empire. The issue of slavery only makes the Assassins support of the Empire odd. One of their founders, the fictional Ishak Pasha, was some commander of the army.\n\n\\- The presence of Roma as a minority was pointed out to me by a poster as a case of Ubisoft showing minorities in an European game. That point is valid, but it's also the case that the Roma are dealt with like jokes and not shown seriously. The Roma occupied a liminal space in Ottoman society, being marginalized and denied protections given to Orthodox (called Rum), Jews, Armenians (in the classical era at least), but they were also the object of fascination and attention by Ottoman society and at various times they were subject to hostility and violence. What they weren't were a faction on standby who would for a few coins go and flirt with Ottoman guards and Janisarries as this game relegates them. The Roma were confined to their own quarters rather than scattered across the city, at least publicly.\n\n\\- **The main problem with Revelations overall is that this is a Turkish game with an Italian Protagonist.** Until Revelations, Ubisoft has always had a protagonist come from that land, whether Altair in Syria, Ezio in Florence. The next games would go with colonial settings, and in that regard Revelations has more in common there. **Ezio in Revelations is totally a classic white archaeologist who comes to foreign lands, wrecks stuff up, and steals an artifact**. He starts a riot in Theodosius, he burns numerous ships at anchor in the Golden Horn, violates Ottoman national interests by breaking their chain boom, he starts a fire and smog in an underground city in Cappadoccia that visibly killed many innocent people. He snorkels down ancient monuments, pirouettes around the roofs and interiors of Ottoman mosques, and does this all for his own private McGuffin. As such, **I rooted for Sultan Selim the Grim to banish this Italian creep from Turkey, especially with his awesome laugh at the end.** I wish I could say this was subversive and stuff, and it was probably intended as such, but we never have this called out to Ezio by his co-Assassins and other neutral Turks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nEspecially after AC2 and Brotherhood, Revelations feels like an attempt to correct and question the Assassins' tendency to ally with sympathetic nobles to fight others. It feels like a self-critical game. The Assassins ally with the Ottomans, the Templars gain support from people who lost to the Turks and it feels logical. The problem comes when this self-critique is restricted to the story and it doesn't go to the characters, with Ezio and Yusuf Tazim never empathizing with their enemies and questioning their own alliance with the Ottomans. There probably should be another open-world game set in the Ottoman Empire, and that is stuff people to consider. Ideally I'd love to see a multi-city game that looks at both the European and Asian sides of the Empire and how similar/different they were and so on.\n\nAnyway, Ezio and Altair are done. The next AC games until ORIGINS are all Anglophone, even Unity notoriously with its fake accents. So we are now going to the English Speaking World which means a more familiar place to talk about at least in terms of class, costumes, social geography. **AC3 is similar to Revelations in that it's a game with 2 settings, 2 protagonists and time periods**, a prologue set in the 1750s during the Seven Years War, and the main game which is set mainly in the decade of the 1770s-1780s of the American Revolution. **In my view, Revelations pulled that balance better than AC3 did,** but that I will discuss later.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n1. *Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities.* Bettany Hughes.

        "text": "Ignoring all arguments of [ethnogenesis](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-025920) [this article](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/were-hebrews-ever-slaves-in-ancient-egypt-yes-1.5429843) from Israeli centre-left national daily Ha'aretz has concluded that slavery of the Hebrews in Egypt was a historical fact against overwhelming historical consensus (*\"The question of historical accuracy in the story of Exodus has occupied scholars since the beginning of modern research,\" says Prof. Finkelstein. \"Most have searched for the historical and archaeological evidence in the Late Bronze Age, the 13th century BCE, partly because  the story mentions the city of Ramses, and because at the end of that century an Egyptian document referred to a group called ’Israel‘ in Canaan. **However, there is no archaeological evidence of the story itself, in either Egypt or Sinai, and what has been perceived as historical evidence from Egyptian sources can be interpreted differently.\"*[[1]](https://english.tau.ac.il/news/exodus_history_and_myth)) and historiography/chronology:\n\n&gt;Were Hebrews Ever Slaves in Ancient Egypt? Yes\n\nNow this challenges all common knowledge currently held in Egyptology, namely, that there was no evidence of slaves building the pyramids (even as Egypt had slavery as an institution) and definitely no evidence of a mass-enslavement of Hebrews within the Nile Delta. How then do they come to this conclusion? It's amusing that they admit this within a paragraph:\n\n&gt;There is no direct evidence that people worshipping Yahweh sojourned in ancient Egypt, let alone during the time the Exodus is believed to have happened. \n\nOkay, so this must be the terminus of the discussion. Right? Entereth The Hyksos:\n\n&gt;Starting over 4,000 years ago, Semites began crossing the deserts from Palestine into Egypt. The tomb of the high priest Khnumhotep II of the 20th century BCE even shows a scene of Semitic traders bringing offerings to the dead (top picture).\n&gt;Some of these Semites came to Egypt as traders and immigrants. Others were prisoners of war, and yet others were sold into slavery by their own people. A papyrus mentions a wealthy Egyptian lord whose 77 slaves included 48 of Semitic origin.\n\nAll of this is true, but still not the mass slavery as described in the Book of Exodus. Now, we enter pure conjecture:\n\n&gt;The Roman-era Jewish historian Josephus for one identifies the Hyksos with the Israelites. He cites the 3rd-century Egyptian scribe and priest Manetho, who wrote that after their expulsion, the Hyksos wandered in the desert before establishing Jerusalem...\n\n&gt;...The absence of evidence of a sojourn in the wilderness proves nothing. A Semitic group in flight wouldn't have left direct evidence: They would not have built cities, built monuments or done anything but leave footprints in the desert sand.\n\n&gt;Yet more support for the Haggadah may lie in an interesting poem copied onto a papyrus dating to the 13th century BCE (although original is believed to be much older), called the \"Admonitions of Impuwer or the Lord of All\").\n\nOkay, so now the author is all over the place, claiming that the emphatically non-Judean Semitic group the Hyksos were the Israelites enslaved in Egypt. While it is true that the Hyksos originated in Palestine, they were not Judeans, and archaeologists [still conclude that we don't know who they truly are.](http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-us12/2012/08/02/who-were-the-hyksos/)\n\n&gt;The Exodus could be a distant Semitic memory of the expulsion of Hyksos, or small-scale exoduses by different tribes and groups of Semitic origin during various periods. Or it could be a fable.\n\n**The Hyksos were never enslaved in Egypt,** and in fact, [once ruled the Upper and Lower Kingdoms,](https://www.ancient.eu/Hyksos/) so there is no evidence to bolster this outlandish claim.\n\n&gt;However many Egyptologists or archaeologists dance on the head of a pin, each will have his own perspective on the Exodus story. None will have any evidence beyond contextual evidence to support their theories.\n\nIncluding the author with his ridiculous clickbait title that claims that insinuates the Exodus is a historical fact.\n\n&gt;Generally, the biblical writers interpreted actual history, rather than invent it. \n\nThere is zero evidence this is true.\n\n&gt;At the end of the day it the story of the Exodus is all matter of faith. This article does not aspire to prove the historicity of the Passover Haggadah, or that the Land of Israel was promised to slaves coming out of Egypt. It just proves that there were historical figures and events that could have inspired the Exodus account.\n\nSo what the hell is with the title of the article and the initial claim?\n\n&gt;Were Hebrews Ever Slaves in Ancient Egypt? Yes\n\nThis is bad history in its quintessence.\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9efp0k/historical_inaccuracies_in_the_ac_series_contd/",
        "text": "In [my last post on AC2](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/9dzdkt/assassins_creed_ii_14591499_adce_historical/), I said I wouldn't do Brotherhood and Revelations. But I read so much about this stuff, that I feel I need to get it out of my chest and not have to revisit it. Also [I got notice from Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/a-fan-is-fact-checking-the-assassins-creed-games-1828909197?utm_medium=Socialflow&amp;utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Twitter&amp;utm_source=Kotaku_Twitter) and they said I am going to do the entire games. It's a bit like that old movie *The Bowery*, where a guy talks smack about jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge, talks a big tale, and finally to save face jumps off for real and survives...so I got myself in this corner. So now on to Brotherhood.\n\nI happen to not be a big fan of Brotherhood. It's a good entertaining game but it's got a slight story. Still Rome as a sandbox is a terrific idea. I just think that they should have chosen Rome from a later era. Like the time of Galileo. It's a game packed with a bunch of content and features and many people who complained about that in AC3 need to accept that Brotherhood started the mess. The other major problem with fact-checking **Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is** that it's **entirely about the Borgia Family.** And **most of the stuff spread about them is hearsay, slander, rumor, and propaganda by their enemies.** To be entirely frank, this stuff is perhaps way more interesting than what the reality of their lives most likely were. So I am not going to blame Ubisoft for **Brotherhood**, which **is basically an encyclopedia of anti-Borgia rumor**. The Incest, the Murder, the Poisoning, the Patricide, it's all there. **I struggled to find decent objective books about the Borgia that doesn't slander or defend them too much,** and my feeling is that academics about the Italian Renaissance history don't find them especially interesting given how small their period of power and influence was.\n\nBrotherhood has a much smaller number of main missions than AC2 does. The Side missions have more meat, and show off Rome better but most of the side-missions are thin on historical content. The Den missions, where you send Assassins around Europe to do stuff is text-based and lore related and is full of historical references but fact-checking that will be a nightmare and most of it is not going to be part of the main baseline experience of the game's narrative anyway. It's mostly just button prompt, send and then wait for the update. There's no real character connection and interaction with these missions. Like why is that the Assassins seem to support the Tudor regime under Henry VII and so on, and given that these games have multiple writers with different writers working on texts of different missions, it does feel like someone went over encyclopaedias and randomly attached them here.\n\n**SETTING:** *The Papal States \\[1499-1507\\]*\n\n**POP CULTURE IDEA:** The Borgia are usually not shown too often in movies. There was an entire cottage industry of TV Shows including one with Jeremy Irons but that came out after this game. But basically the main idea of Borgia is that Cesare and Lucrezia were incestuous, Daddy Pope was a creepy philanderer, all of them poisoned and killed a bunch of people, and they held a lot of orgies in the Vatican. With that in mind, **BROTHERHOOD is a kind of Soft-R take on this essentially NC-17 premise.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MAIN MISSIONS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 1 - Sequence 3: Ezio's Arrival in Rome and Plotting \\[1499-1500\\]*\n\n**We start at the Siege of Viana, on the last day of Cesare's life, which we will return to later in the game**. The big inaccuracy here and also in other parts of Brotherhood is that **Cesare at the time of his death was noted for wearing a leather mask in public to hide the scars of syphillis which damaged his pretty face**. That would have been cool to see and the game misses a chance to show it.\n\n**The game really begins when Cesare Borgia attacks Monteriggioni** with his huge siege engines, the support of the French army, and then takes Caterina Sforza captive. **This never happened. Cesare Borgia's conquest in real-life was entirely limited to Emilia-Romagna region and it never came all the way to Tuscany** which is where Monteriggioni is in. Caterina Sforza was captured in Forli, in Emilia-Romagna when Cesare came. For some bizarre reason, Ubisoft put a fake siege in Battle of Forli DLC, and then put another fake siege in Monteriggioni for no reason, and have Caterina captured in Monteriggioni, rather than doing things in the proper timeline with the Siege of Forli and her capture in the proper time period.\n\nAlso **the entire battle tactics shown here is off. Cesare Borgia's army attacks and bombards Monteriggioni without laying siege to it, i.e. asking for surrender, cutting off food and so on. The entire approach seems a bit closer to \"total war\" and modern rather than Late medieval-Early Modern.** There's also no way that this would be such a surprise attack. An army of that size approaching a city would have been seen along the way, reported by spies, and scouts so on. How the Assassins, some secret society missed this is ridiculous. The real Cesare Borgia when he laid siege on Forli tried to negotiate surrender numerous times, put a prize on Caterina's head, and only then bombarded the site which was right. In the old days, in any siege, the understanding on all sides was that the defending side by trying to prolong a hopeless war, got the onus for the blame of sack and looting by antsy besiegers who saw their lives lost on the cusp of victory as an unjust loss. In the real-life case of Forli, Caterina Sforza prolonged a hopeless siege which she could not sustain and refused all tokens, over the demands and interests of her own subjects. All things considered, the fact she ended as a Papal hostage was more lenient than what would have happened had the army not been better controlled than it was.\n\nBrotherhood also has Machiavelli as the major supporting figure. In real-life, Machiavelli was a diplomat serving the Republic of Florence in the Post-Savonarola phase, trying to be Medici-free and independent at the same time. Very dicey. The big problem is him wanting to undermine Cesare Borgia and his dad. That's not exactly Machiavellian practice or his principles. **The real Machiavelli had cordial relations with Cesare Borgia,** and actually was quite interested in the Papal Estates' plan to unify Italy which he believed was definitely necessary and essential to keep it from being sacked and looted by the Spanish, the French, and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n**The major running thread throughout Brotherhood, in its portrayal of Rome, both story and open-world design, is that the Borgia ran the city into the ground** and impoverished it. We see this in the game throughout. The Borgia guards are rapists, murderers, thugs, gangsters. Economic investment and shops only open for purchase when Ezio burns down Borgia towers and the underlying metaphor is **that Ezio and the Assassins brought the Renaissance** magic to the city\\*\\*.\\*\\* Now **there is an element of truth**. It is a widely documented fact, and a truism, that Rome declined in the period after the Fall of the Empire, and that during the early years of the Renaissance, the city lagged behind rising powers like Florence and Venice. Rome's rebirth and revival began later than other Italian cities. **The 1400s, or quattrocento in Italian, belonged to Florence. The 1500s, or cinquecento, belonged to Rome.** The idea in Brotherhood of Rome starting out in decline has merit. It's also the case that many Florentine artists like Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo came to Rome only in the 1500s. So Ezio being a Florentine Patron of the city is not bad as a metaphor. **What is unfair however is that the real Borgia were the ones who started the revival of the city, and the reassertion of Rome.** They didn't run the city to the ground like they did here. **The Borgia were generally popular and relatively philanthropic to the people of Rome. Their main opponents were the traditional Roman elite and aristocracy.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 4 - Sequence 8: Ezio's Arrival in Rome and Plotting \\[1501-1504\\]*\n\n**Caterina Sforza was imprisoned but she wasn't kept in a dirty cell like this. As a noblewoman, she was kept in plush conditions befitting her rank.** Lucrezia Borgia is shown as her gaoler, taunting her, and beating her. The game's Lucrezia is nothing like the one described in history at least not in public. Here she's some kind of bad-teen movie \"bad girl\" rather than the educated and accomplished noblewoman she was. **Caterina Sforza was freed by the the efforts of the King of France, who negotiated her release and pulled strings** with the Pope. She wasn't sprung out of prison like here. She did in fact make an attempt at escape but she was caught and brought back.\n\n**The character of \"The Banker\"**, Juan Borgia **is entirely fictional**, though he does share a name with many similarly named Juan Borgias. **Also fictional is Baron de Valois** who is a stand-in for Cesare Borgia's French allies. **These sequences also bring us to the real-life Bartolomeo d'Alviano,** returning from AC2. His wife Pantasilea is fictional. The real Bartolomeo was **aligned with anti-Borgia families, so what we see here is not incorrect**.\n\n**Micheletto Corella, Cesare Borgia's hatchet-man is real.** He was a pretty shady, nasty piece of work in general. He ran a protection racket in Rome, and was noted to extort Jewish refugees settled in Rome's Jewish Quarter (which like everything to do with Jewish people is absent from this and other Ubisoft games). **He was however also a condotierro and mercenary and as such he shouldn't look as he does in the game, which is as some unctious Grima Wormtongue type. He should look a little tougher.** He's spared by Ezio but the interesting thing is that **in real history, he and Machiavelli apparently had a friendship. Machiavelli later got him a job in Florence.** The lore states that Cesare later killed him, but Michelletto actually died in 1508 in Milan, a year after Cesare. **I honestly don't know why if Ubisoft were going to fudge his real death in the lore, they didn't go all the way and have you kill him in the game. Both are equally inaccurate historically but at least the latter would be more satisfying in terms of gameplay.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 9-10. The Fall of the Borgia \\[1504-1507\\]*\n\nEzio returns to Castel Sant'Angelo and tracks Cesare. **This part implies that the Borgia actually lived inside the Castel. But in fact, the Pope actually resided in the Apostolic Palace**, and [Rodrigo Borgia was famous for his bespoke Borgia Apartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgia_Apartments). That's where he died. The game shows Cesare Borgia killing him. But while it's not unlikely that Rodrigo was poisoned, Cesare wouldn't have done it. Cesare Borgia and his dad were close, and more crucially, he depended on his father for everything.\n\n**The game's big error** is that it implies that the Concave after Rodrigo's death chose Pope Julius II. In actual fact that **there was an intermediate Pope Pius III between Alexander VI and Julius II**. He was Pope for less than a month and then he died. Then the concave after that chose Pope Julius II. It also shows Cesare Borgia's power slackening after Rodrigo's death. That didn't immediately happen. He used his forces and surrounded the concave and initially Pope Pius III was a puppet, but then he died (with some rumors of poison). Then Julius II came in, initially promising Cesare Borgia the world and then screwing him over. **The curious thing about the missing Pope Pius III is that he**, as a Borgia puppet Pope, **could have easily been made an Assassination target**, but the game instead removes it and contrives for a bunch of linear action scenes. Now there are story reasons. For instance, Rodrigo Borgia's death being a climax, and then another Pope, and then a Pope after that might feel overdone, but I don't think players would have bothered as much since this is a short game and the finale has a lot of delays and back and forth. **The only reason this is missing is I think that Ubisoft did not want players to actually assassinate a Pope, historical or otherwise, because they didn't want to upset the Church too much or resemble in any way real-life assassinations.**\n\nCesare Borgia wasn't arrested by Orsini, he was simply shuttled out of Rome to some dead-end places. Cesare Borgia indeed died in battle at the Siege of Viana. The manner of his death though is different\\*\\*. In the game Ezio fights him and a bunch of guards, which suggests that Cesare was a coward. IN fact, Cesare Borgia\\*\\* chased a bunch of knights on his own single-mindedly and then got ambushed and jumped. He **died in an act of crazed bravery and not like a coward.** That's the main campaign. As for the side missions,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***SIDE MISSIONS: Leonardo da Vinci Missions and DLC***\n\nLeonardo da Vinci worked in Florence until 1480, and then he worked in Milan, and not Venice as AC2 implied. He then briefly entered Cesare's service and worked as an engineer. Leonardo actually designed a canal in Romagna for Cesare Borgia. As for whether Leonardo's war machines might have been functional. [One surprising theory that has come up in Leonardo circles](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/pacifist-leonardo-may-have-made-mistakes-to-foil-warlords-20021212-gdfybt.html) is the idea that **Leonardo's designs** for a tank, a bomber, and a canon and so on, **had intentional mistakes** because he was worried that it might be misused. **This is just a theory but that does give the game's idea that Leonardo would want Ezio to destroy his inventions some plausibility.** Scientifically and physically, the inventions shouldn't work as well as they do here, so that's fictional. **On the other hand, Leonardo and Cesare Borgia actually got on pretty well and Cesare's downfall marked a lean time for him, because he couldn't find another patron until the King of France came.**\n\nThe DLC's portrayal of his relationship with Salai seems accurate. There was a lot of exploitation, angst, and so on. Leonardo is also shown aging in this time and it seems like a classic cask of an old guy finding [a twink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twink_(gay_slang)). One thing I wished the game was more upfront about is the suggestion that Leonardo had a crush on Ezio or was in love with him. We see this in brotherhood in the last cutscene with his invention upgrades, where Leonardo puts an arm over Ezio and he says, \"I don't get it\". **Ezio's cluelessness about homosexuality in this scene (albeit not in the DLC), is kind of off, because homosexuality was certainly identified and recognized, at least among aristocrats, artists and bohemians, the kind of people Ezio hangs out with.** Since Renaissance Italy was all about rediscovering the Roman and Greek classics, they identified and in some cases tried to emulate the antique sophistication and curiosity about homosexuality. **The big issue of course is being private about it, and not getting caught**, and making sure that it was out of the eye of society. The whole Hermerticist stuff is fictional nonsense so I am not bothered with that.\n\nThe other side missions don't have history. The Followers of Romulus stuff is based on the movie The Brotherhood of the Wolf. **The Letters of Brutus deals with Caesar's assassination and I would have covered that but since Origins has that anyway, I'll deal with that there**. The Cristina memories don't have history either with both being fictional characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OBSERVATIONS**\n\n\\- **The big irony of the game being Anti-Borgia and Ezio paving the way for Julius II is that there wasn't any real difference between them**. And I don't mean that in the sense that the Borgia weren't as bad as history made them out to be, or that the Borgia weren't as bad as other nobles. I mean specifically in terms of policies. **Ezio opposes Cesare for his militarism**, his attempts to expand the Papal States and try and unify Italy, **all of that would be continued and with greater gusto, and greater success, by Julius II**. Julius II's actions and policies, his patronage and development of Rome, strengthened it and weakened Florence, paving the way for the return of the Medici, which would lead to Machiavelli's torture when the city fell in 1512. Now of course **all that happened some time after, but the game presents the downfall of the Borgia as a total good and Ezio's success as unvarnished**. There's no hint or element of irony there.\n\n\\- **The problem with AC2 and Brotherhood framing Borgia as this ultimate evil** is that in actual fact the Borgia had influence and real power for barely more than a decade. **They were all things considered, minor figures in the whole scope of the Renaissance and** [the Italian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars)**.** Go the wikipedia page and Ctrl+F and you won't find any mention of Borgia there. If not for the rumors and so on, nobody would care about them as much as they do.\n\n\\- **Most of the stuff about the Borgia was printed after their downfall** by Pope Julius II. This includes accusations of incest, **all of which is unprovable**. The weird thing is why people want to give credence to this accusation. Because Julius II also claimed that the Borgia were Jewish. Spanish conversos who shifted to Christianity to fit in during the Reconquista. Again the game severely downplays anti-semitism fairly thoroughly. So fundamentally this is about how bad you want the Borgia to be. **Stuff like Cesare Borgia apparently killing his brother Giovanni is unproven** and has no evidence. It's just rumors and **it depends on how evil you want Cesare to be**. Stuff like the multiple poisonings in the game's plot and backstory was rumored all the time and probably did happen. What that means is that in real history, almost any sudden death in the Renaissance could be poisoning if it was successful. Since it's not provable and so on. So I am going to give Ubisoft props for that.\n\n\\- **As for the political context** of the Borgia. That needs some understanding of Rome, the Papal States, the Rest of Italy and Europe. **Way too much to go into. But the gist of it** is that, according to Meyer (sourced below), **the Borgia were fighting to ensure a more centralized Papal States** under direct Vatican control than before. They were **putting into effect what many Popes before had dreamed** about. To do this, the Borgia moved against the families of Rome and the Papal States i.e. both the city of Rome and the area around Rome and environs. That includes the Orsini (we see Fabio Orsini briefly, real guy), and the Colonna, and in Emilia-Romagna, the Sforza. The problems were that the Borgia were Spanish. And even if the Borgia were not entirely eye-to-eye with the Kingdom of Spain, what with the Pope allowing Jewish refugees fleeing Spain to settle in Rome and everything. It was easy for them to be painted as puppets of Spanish influence and you know smelly foreigners and social climbing upstarts. The Borgia got into an alliance with the King of France that allowed them to make Rome a big Italian power again. As Meyer says, \"\\[The Borgia\\] gave Rome a strength—albeit a largely borrowed strength—that it had barely possessed since the time, seven hundred years before, when Charlemagne and his father had made themselves masters of Italy and shared their conquests with the popes of the time.\"\n\n\\- **The portrayal of Caterina Sforza in Brotherhood is quite hagiographic**, with her being some kind of populist. It's certainly true that she got a bad rap, and a lot of that was down to misogyny. But Caterina Sforza was just as ruthless as Cesare Borgia, the Medici, and any Italian noble. She was famous for wiping out not only enemies, but whole families including women and children. That can be lent into as a sort of \"Either them or me, their children or my children\" but making her an ally of Proto-Anarchist Populist like Assassins is uncalled for.\n\n\\- **Cesare Borgia was generally speaking not a total psychopath** as this game portrays. Indeed, as Machiavelli described in The Prince and as others, **he was famous in public and in private for being charming, friendly, and charismatic but also ruthless and cold**. That was his real quality. He wasn't Joffrey. When he conquered Emilia-Romagna, he made a lot of important reforms and provided good governance, and the people saw him as an improvement over Caterina Sforza and other lords there:\n\n&gt;**Cesare** established a headquarters at Imola and, employing some of his clergymen relatives as administrators, **set about organizing his new duchy of Romagna**. **In doing so he demonstrated that he had learned from the example of Pope Alexander**, who from the reign of Calixtus III had displayed a good understanding of the problems of the Papal States and a keen appreciation of the value of firm and honest administration in maintaining order and creating loyalty. **Cesare replaced the capricious and often savagely cruel rule** of the likes of Caterina Sforza **with something the Romagnese people had not experienced since ancient times: governmental machinery that functioned fairly and efficiently and delivered real justice**...Cesare created a new office, *presidente*, and appointed to it a distinguished jurist and humanist scholar named Antonio di Monte Sansovino, not just personally honest but devoted to rooting out official corruption. The administration that Sansovino put in place marked the opening of a new era for the Romagna. **It made Cesare a popular figure, a ruler for whom many of the region’s people would be willing to fight.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Meyer, The Borgia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The portrayal of **Rome in Brotherhood is a mixed bag**. The producers were stuck in a Golden Mean of showing Rome as it was before the transformation of Julius II, and also giving people a more transcendental picture-postcard version of the city. **We have baroque architecture in many buildings when that is more characteristic of the late 1500s-1600s**. We have monuments preserved from the classical and ancient era and a bunch of ruins, but they still look a bit more like contemporary ruins, i.e. after the modern archaeological and restoration work done on them. Rome of this time was famous for the fact that a number of marble from old-buildings was stolen by artists, traders, thieves, or black market people and sold to other cities for use in their work. So **the monuments should look more ramshackle, shaky and decrepit than what we get here**. \n\n\\- **The big thing that is missing,** is **the Jewish quarter of the city**. I am going to repeat from earlier posts. **The lack of diversity is justifiable in Ac1** since we only focus on Altair and the game doesn't have major supporting characters and story-related side-quests. **But the more detail in later games**, the more history, the more background, and greater database, **makes it less justifiable.** Continuing from AC2, the absence of Jews in Florence and Venice was a major missing element, but I would say that the fact that the Jewish ghetto in venice was built in 1515, after the timeline still made it okay, relatively speaking. **What is indefensible is removing an entire section of the city dedicated to Jews from the time, year, and period, and setting of the game.** The fact that many of these Jews were patronized by Borgia, albeit exploited by thugs like Micheletto and others would have made for wonderful nuance and detail in the story. **The Tiber river** was famously filthy in this time, and we shouldn't be able to swim in it as we do. **But this is also a problem in Syndicate and Thames**. So I am not going to judge Brotherhood for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nSo that's Brotherhood. A mixed bag of a game in terms of history. The Borgia we see in this game are entirely fictitious and different from who they were. **The story openly takes the side of a bunch of aristocrats, Sforza, Orsini, Colonna, Pope Julius II** and **playacts as if the triumph of some corrupt nobles over other corrupt nobles would be good** for civilization, for Rome, and Italy. **None of this is true**. Some 15 years after this game, Papal machinations led to a Sack of Rome by the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Julius II would screw over the city of Florence and get Machiavelli tortured. **Italy overall would continue to be weakened and impoverished** by these constant wars, by the brain drain of its best artists to other parts of Europe and ultimately the shift in power away from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. **The story of the Italian Renaissance, contrary to the idea of classical rebirth** is one which **saw the center of power shift forever away from the former Roman Empires in the West and East, to France, Spain, England, Holland**. \n\nAnd we have only Ezio Auditore to blame. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOURCES**\n\nI used both physical copies and ebook versions of these titles. \n\n*The Borgias: The Hidden History.* G.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit I\\] I have received a number of responses that highlight a particular part of my post, mainly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Literacy levels during the MP were famously low. Unless you were wealthy or part of the clergy it was unlikely that you were able to read and write. Now the issue with Shad’s sources, is that those writing at the time are likely to have had a markedly different experience of war than the average soldier. Just as it is today, the higher up the command you are, the less likely you are going to be killed in general fighting. Furthermore, the wealthier someone is, the more likely they are to be fighting out of choice, rather than against their will. The average English peasant is going to have a lot less control over their own destiny than their liege lord. The lord, who is doing most of the writing, would also stand to gain the most from the war and is therefore likely to view it a little more favourably. Because we do not have access to Shad’s sources, I cannot be more specific in this regard.\n\nI will address this here so that I don't have to keep repeating myself in the comments below. I freely admit that I am not a medieval historian, that does not disqualify this post. This post is not specifically about the composition of medieval armies. The point quoted above was to highlight one glaring issue you must consider when making such a bold claim as \"medieval people loved WAR.\" This entire post was written to expose bad methodology and ask the question \"What makes you sure you are correct?\" In any academic work it is natural to admit to and address limitations. So when you make such a bold statement, surely you must have some incontrovertible evidence that what you are saying is true? Shad mentions he has been reading contemporary accounts, but did he consider literacy levels in the general population at the time? How can you make such a bold statement without considering how limited your sources may be? Again, this post is **not about medieval military practice**, it is highlighting how poor a premise this entire video is based off of.\n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to preface this post by clearing a couple of things up. I have not included any sources, despite calling Shadiversity out for doing the same. The reason for this is that a lot of my arguments either rely on common information or are based on highlighting inconsistencies, exposing bad methodology or revealing bad reasoning and the conclusions drawn from them. Secondly I would like to note that I have a lot of respect for Shad and enjoy watching his videos and I hope that this critique does not come across as me intended to call into question his intelligence, integrity and expertise. I believe he has demonstrated bad history in his latest video and it is important to discuss these things, regardless of the one making them. Furthermore, I would like to note that many of my arguments are about general concepts, methodology and historical thinking. Some people in my previous post claimed that these types of critiques are closer to bad philosophy etc. I disagree with those claims, because I am a big believer that history should not only be concerned with what happened, but how we think about past, how we present that past and how we tackle some of the larger questions that are posed by an intimate study of history. You may disagree and that is totally fine.\n\nAnd now for the actual post…\n\nVideo in question ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1-IgyfVU80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1-IgyfVU80)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShadiversity recently released a video titled “Why medieval people loved WAR.” In this video Shad makes his case that people during the medieval period have a different attitude to war than we do today. He claims in essence that today war is seen as a “universal evil” while in the past, in general, it was not viewed with such disdain. This video is full of bad history evidenced in its premise, methodology, conclusions and framing. Shad is great to watch and its rightly recognised as an expert when it comes to his knowledge of historical weapons, however this video falls dramatically short of his usual standard.\n\nThere are absolutely no sources referenced in the video. The video itself consists of Shad speaking into the camera as if we were sitting opposite one another and therefore it has a very conversational tone. In a normal conversation it is usually unrealistic to ask someone for their sources, but when it comes to a video that is posted online and viewed thousands of times by people who believe in the poster’s expertise, it is essential to at least point them in the direction of where you got your sources. This has been covered by others and is reflective of a larger trend within history videos posted on YouTube. Sources are usually not cited, and many falsehoods are presented as fact. This is not likely to change. History videos as they currently are, are extremely popular and its unrealistic to believe that those viewers are likely to be motivated to check videos for their authenticity – unless of course they are fans of /r/badhistory.\n\nBefore even addressing the content of Shad’s argument there is an issue with framing. He speaks in broad generalisations but does not address a specific time or place. The ‘medieval period’ covers almost a millennium, and it is ridiculous to make an argument that presupposes that someone living in England in 900CE is not recognisably different in their attitudes to war as someone living in 1400CE. Furthermore, he does not frame his argument geographically either. It is simply not possible to paint everyone that was alive at a certain time with one brush. If we don’t do that for our own time, how can we reduce history in that way?\n\nThroughout the video Shad frequently says that there are exceptions to the rule, but that in general things were as he claims. These disclaimers are weak, supposing that exceptions to the rule existed but were simply exceptions and not evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe main premise of the video is to highlight the alleged differences between the MP and today regarding attitudes to war. Shad therefore makes his case, which relies on two assumptions being true. Firstly, it assumes that people during the medieval period did in fact “love WAR” and secondly it assumes that war is not “loved” today. This argument is reductionist and requires sweeping generalisations to make everything fit. The second point should be demonstrably false. There is still appetite for war, as evidenced by the numerous conflicts ongoing across the globe, and the number of wars that we have had since the end of the Second World War. Shad makes the faulty assertion that we have fundamentally changed our views of war considering how horrible the First and Second World Wars were. Yet, wars continue, and they are justified by those that wish to wage them. While there is no doubt how horrible these wars were, they have not lessened our appetite for them. Shad and I are both from the UK, so I understand where he is coming from, in his mind the lack of a war in western Europe is reflective of our changing attitudes. However, this relative period of peace is a result of the post-war political landscape of Europe and the awareness of how utterly destructive a war between two western European powers would be. If there is a lessened appetite, it is because of the realisation that there are no winners in a nuclear war, and not as he presumes, from some sense of morality. If it truly were morality at play, then we would not have been involved in so many wars overseas. The first point, that people in the MP loved war, well that is a little harder to disprove outright, but in the case of such a broad claim the burden of proof is with Shad on this one and will address his arguments for why he believes this to be the case.\n\nShad seems to argue from a position that we will only ever find ourselves in a war if we believe it to be just and that when we are compelled to go to war, it is seen as a tragedy. Finding a justification for war is not a new idea. It is quite rare for there to be a conflict where the aggressor was completely honest in their intentions to seize something belonging to someone else. Even Hitler made up some lame duck excuses to give his administration a veneer of legitimacy in declaring war. Shad frequently mentions the “bad guys”, yet it is important to understand that there are very few people that ever truly believe they are a bad person. People will always find a way to justify their actions, and nations are no different in that regard.\n\nShad states that he believes in what he terms “a righteous war.” A war that we know to be a necessary evil, in order to preserve for example, an ethnic group. I don’t disagree with him on this point, however I am at a loss to think of one example off the top of my head. In many cases this appeal to ethics is used as a justification, whilst obscuring more…materialistic reasons. Has there ever been a war declared where the aggressor believed it would be worse of for it? Shad uses the Second World War as an example of a righteous war. This claim could warrant a post on this forum in of itself. The Second World War was not fought for ethical reasons, it was to put an end to German expansion within Europe. After the war it was felt that the war was justified when the horrors of the Holocaust came to light, but lets not delude ourselves into believing that it was initially fought over a sense indignation over the persecution of Jews and other minorities within Germany and its occupied territories.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with this video is the lack of critical thinking when it comes to source material. Shad makes a number of generalised statements about a non-descript time and place. However furthermore he does not even attempt to address source diversity. Literacy levels during the MP were famously low. Unless you were wealthy or part of the clergy it was unlikely that you were able to read and write. Now the issue with Shad’s sources, is that those writing at the time are likely to have had a markedly different experience of war than the average soldier. Just as it is today, the higher up the command you are, the less likely you are going to be killed in general fighting. Furthermore, the wealthier someone is, the more likely they are to be fighting out of choice, rather than against their will. The average English peasant is going to have a lot less control over their own destiny than their liege lord. The lord, who is doing most of the writing, would also stand to gain the most from the war and is therefore likely to view it a little more favourably. Because we do not have access to Shad’s sources, I cannot be more specific in this regard.\n\nShad further makes a claim that the reason there is such a difference in how we view war, is a result of how we view death. He rightly points out that mortality rates were higher during the MP but draws the wrong conclusions. Infant mortality up until recent times has always been high, and a miscarriage of the death of a toddler was not uncommon as it is now. But it is a giant leap to believe that simply because death may have been more prevalent than in modern day England, that the value of life was not appreciated as it is today. Again, I would like to see the sources that he is basing the claim on, and how it would even be measured. While death may not be prevalent within Shad’s life, as he claims, that is not the case for others, especially in developing countries. He partly evidences his claim about the importance of death with medieval society by referencing the nursery rhymes “Ring around the rosie,” “Rock-a-bye Baby” and “Jack and Jill.” The first two definitely do not originate from the medieval period, and it is not agreed that any of them are specifically about death. A simple google search can reveal that. Even if they were about death, how does that in any way prove the point? It is akin to someone centuries from now claiming that people in the 21st century had a society dominated by the fear of accidents due to the prevalence of FailArmy.\n\nTo further support his claim, he references that people were so desensitised to death that it even became a form of entertainment. He notes that public executions drew large crowds. And its true, public executions were in many cases an excuse to have a large public party. By making this claim he supposes that this has somehow changed. Yes, in the western world we have either outlawed state executions or conduct them behind closed doors. But what about other forms of violence? Our news, books, movies and games are absolutely dominated by death. It is simply false to believe that we have somehow lost our appetite for death. It is simply presented in a different medium. He has an entire channel dedicated to the instruments and paraphernalia of war. War is interesting, and so is death.\n\nShad makes another claim, that there was a fundamental change in how we viewed war between the first and second world wars. He mentions that the announcement of the first world war was met with celebrations, while the second was met with “tears.” Furthermore, he evidences this change by anecdotally referencing a study that indicated that soldiers during the Second World War were found to be shooting in a general direction and not at someone, and he claims this was a result of conflicting morality. The first statement may hold some merit, but if we put ourselves in the shoes of an average Englishman in September 1939 we would have to appreciate that the First World War was within living memory and that the announcement of the war was anti-climatic as Chamberlain’s ultimatum ran its course. As for the second claim, we are led to believe through modern films and games that most combat happens at extremely close ranges, when in fact engagements usually happen at a distance and it is not always evident where the enemy is and therefore soldiers will fire in a general direction to supress the enemy. Even if it were case that the soldiers mentioned were not shooting out of their unwillingness to kill, why should we suppose that it was any different from a man-at-arms during the 12th century? Shad backs up this claim by stating that medieval warfare was more intimate that it currently is, but how so? When he makes this claim he shows a photo of two knights duelling, but that is not representative of medieval combat. Combat usually consisted of large formations engaging each other, where the front line tried to hack at any limb that was exposed. If were to make these hypothetical arguments, wouldn’t it be fairer to claim that modern warfare is more intimate as the face is usually unimpeded by a visor? Does a sniper looking down his sights not have a more intimate view of his unsuspecting victim than a cavalryman bearing down upon his target? I am not trying to make this argument, I'm just showing how it can be argued either way, but regardless its not a useful argument to have.\n\nShad makes the claim that in general, people enjoyed war back then and that it was a way in which men could compete and prove their worth. He also makes several broad claims in regard to gender and applies them to his historical argument, but I won’t be touching that claim with a thirty-foot pike. He doubles down on this line of argument by further claiming that most people serve today out a sense of patriotism and duty. But even without sourcing data to the contrary, is it even reasonable to make such a claim? It is no secret that people join the armed forces for a whole host of reasons, whether that be a chance for a career, a steady pay check or a desire for adventure. And to claim that people during the medieval period enjoyed it, where is the evidence to suggest that? And if he has the source, was it written by the average soldier or someone in a position of power as highlighted earlier. The average foot soldier during the MP probably had fewer reasons to go to war, as the concept of a professional army was not really in existence during this period, but are we really to believe that it is as simple as he claims? This also highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of warfare during the period. War was on a much smaller scale, in part due to the decentralised power structure. He claims that war back then was more about taking what you wanted, but I have already discussed the fact that just because someone claims some moral justification doesn’t make it so in fact.\n\nOne of the main issues with the methodology of this video is that Shad assumes that his views and his surrounding are indicative of modern society. To demonstrate this, he claims that we don’t have to worry about dying of cold or exposure as much as we did, which is an incredibly ignorant statement. Yes, he may be able to turn on the heating if it gets a bit nippy, but that experience is not shared across the world, in fact it is not even universally shared in bear old blighty.\n\nOne major problem Shad’s argument has, is that it seems that he is buying into bad historical practice. There is a problem that many people make in which they view history from within the framework of society constantly progressing throughout time. This leads us to denigrate entire generations and believe them to be inferior which can cause problems with how we draw conclusions. Are we to believe that war was not as horrible for them as it is for us? That they had no morals? That they lacked individual agency? That they loved violence? People back then were as varied as they are today. The irony of it is that at the end of the video Shad asks us to remember to try and view these issues from their perspective, but just like his frequent disclaimers they are meaningless when you do the exact opposite. Its like beginning your sentence with “I’m not racist but…” and then you proceed to make a racist argument, words are meaningless if you don’t follow through.",

        "text": "Previously [I covered Unity](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins_creed_unity_a_near_complete_list_of/), then I went backward and [started with AC1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dq6uy/historical_inaccuracy_in_assassins_creed_series/), and now I am going to do look at the historical backdrop of Assassin's Creed II and see how it measures up to history.\n\n**AC2 is a much bigger game than AC1**. It has a story that covers forty years of a man's life which is actually pretty unique. It makes the game feel like a long historical novel the way few open-world games manage. That is to its credit. **In AC1, you had 7 historical figures** on-screen (Al Mualim/Rashid ad-din Sinan, Robert de Sable, Garnier de Nablus, William of Montferrat, Sibrand, Jubair, King Richard I) balanced with other fictional characters who have the most screen-time (namely Altair and Malik). **AC1 had at most 10-12 real monuments**. By comparison, **AC2 has some 20-odd historical figures**. **An even greater number of monuments, art-works and so on. You have the database here** for the first time. More than that, while these games are mainly the story of the fictional Auditore family, the side-missions and optional conversations really emphasize supporting characters and villains more than the first game did. So there's a lot more to cover here.\n\n**SOURCES listed at the end.** So let's begin.\n\n***Assassin's Creed II***\n\n***Setting***: Italy during the City State era between 1459-1507 - The Florentine Republic, Tuscany, Romagna, the Republic of Venice, and the Papal States.\n\n***Pop-Culture View of The Renaissance***: The Renaissance is interesting because there really isn't one big movie about the period. Most people's idea of Renaissance is based on Tudor England, which was basically the last major European country to participate. Most people's idea of the Renaissance is based on the Da Vinci Code, on Machiavelli's Prince, Harry Lime's famous Cuckoo-Clock speech in *The Third Man*, and also stuff like *The Godfather* where the Mafia are treated as princes, and people assume that the Renaissance feudal families were like mob-bosses based on that. That line in Godfather III, where Michael Corleone says, \"We're back to the Borgias\" clinches it.\n\n**MAIN CAMPAIGN**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequences 1-3: This is Ezio's Origin story. 1476-1478.*\n\nEzio was born in 1459 (we see his birth in a short scene) and then we meet him and his brother in a street fight with Vieri Pazzi in the year 1476. Vieri de'Pazzi is a fictional character, but his dad and Uncle were real. Street fights like the one you saw there weren't uncommon except that noblemen like Ezio and Vieri were unlikely to fight each other themselves. It was more likely for them to hire bravos (i.e. mercenary thugs with short swords) to do it for them. The Auditore family is wholly fictional as is their villa. In the course of the entire story of their downfall and Ezio killing Uberto and then going to Monteriggioni, we learn that the Auditore are an up-jumped recently ennobled family aligned with Lorenzo de'Medici before being framed by the Templar puppet Gonfalioniere (something like Mayor) Uberto Alberti (also fictional). The entire idea of a Gonfalioniere independently executing someone without Medici approval is absolutely unlikely given the way the Medici corrupted the city government and manipulated appointments.\n\n**The stuff about Monteriggioni's history** that Mario Auditore talks to Ezio, about them fighting Florence in wars and so on, **is accurate. What isn't accurate the town itself**. There's no Villa Auditore at the center, and while it is a tiny walled town, it isn't as small as what you see in the game here. We also get generic architecture when the real Monteriggioni had famous churches which we don't see here.\n\nWe meet **Leonardo da Vinci** here. And he **looks right for his age. and he is described as the handsome magnetic guy his contemporaries** described him as. We also get a reference to him dissecting cadavers when he asks Ezio to leave one of his victims in his study. The period and choice of 1476 is interesting because in that year Leonardo was accused of sodomy and investigated, and there's a huge gap in his life between 1476-1478. [Patrice Desilets, developer of AC2, pointed out that the sodomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syV2-ZuaxC8&amp;t=1s) charge was going to be in this game but the bosses wanted it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequences 4-6: This is the Pazzi Conspiracy sequence. 1478-1480.*\n\nThe conspirators are all real figures (Francesco de'Pazzi, Jacopo de'Pazzi, Bernard de Barnoncelli, Stefano Bagnone, Archbishop Salviati, Antonio Maffei). We also get our first looks at Lorenzo de'Medici and Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia here. One surprising change is the fact that the Conspiracy's main backer, Pope Sixtus and especially his nephew Girolamo Riario (Caterina Sforza's husband) isn't mentioned here. We later meet Caterina Sforza anyway and her husband died in 1488 making him a more logical Templar Grandmaster than the one they chose.\n\n**One of the major problems with a game that spans 40 years is that aging up characters as time passes becomes an issue of realism.** By 1478, the year of the Pazzi Conspiracy, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia was a youngish man, 45 years of age, noted to be handsome, friendly, and kind in person...completely different from the cackling fatso we see throughout the game. He put on weight in his later years. They kind of cover this by making him wear a hood throughout his pre-papal era. Likewise, at this time Rodrigo was Cardinal in a Roman suburb and wasn't anywhere close to the Pazzis and Florence.\n\nThere's a similar problem with Lorenzo de'Medici. If Ezio was born in 1459, then Lorenzo (born in 1449) was ten years older than him. Lorenzo became de-facto head-of-state in 1469, but he looks older. He should look like Ezio's older brother. His characterization as this dignified and fierce statesman is nothing like the real guy. Lorenzo was known to be a playboy and a guy who put on pageants and expensive shows, someone who wasn't all that interested in government. But yeah, he was held in respect and esteem and was quite charismatic so that part is fair here.\n\n**The Pazzi attack on the Medici didn't happen outside il Duomo, it happened inside it**. Lorenzo hid in the sacristry of the Church. The part where the entire city goes on alert and panic when the Medici are attacked is accurate however. Francesco de'Pazzi, Archbishop Salviatti, and Bernardo Baroncelli were all hanged from the windows of Palazzo Vecchio, rather than just Francesco de'Pazzi as we see in this game. The conspirators didn't flee to San Gimignano. They went to nearby villages and towns, were caught, identified and brought back to Florence and executed in public, in very graphic and gruesome fashion. That happened especially in the case of Jacopo de'Pazzi who was caught in Castogna, sent back to Florence, tortured and attacked by a mob, who then cut up his body and attached his head as a door-knocker to his own mansion. Also the game's narrative spacing implies that the conspirators were hunted over a long period of time. In real life, the main conspirators were killed in a matter of days, and the Medici purge of the Pazzi lasted for another three months.\n\nOne thing the game doesn't deal with, was that the **Pazzi Conspiracy was a much bigger event than what we see**. In the two months that followed the attack, **80 people were executed**. So it wasn't a case that Ubisoft ran out of targets or historical figures to kill. **The real thing was way bloodier and gorier**. Whereas in the game it's just the main conspirators. The murder of the Archbishop wasn't like in the game, attacking him in a secret villa at San Gimignano, it was publicly done and it had consequences, with the Pope excommunicating the entire city, and the city's clergy backing Lorenzo and then excommunicating the Pope, and with Naples declaring war on Florence on behalf of the Pope with the entire city in panic of being invaded and occupied. Lorenzo il Magnifico actually personally went to Naples and sweet-talked a peace deal. The bit about Lorenzo de'Medici wiping out the Pazzi. That actually did happen, but Lorenzo also went out of his way to spare a few of them. He also made sure that Riario's relations, a cousin of his lived. So he wasn't as bad as Lucrezia Borgia in Brotherhood made him out to be, though his retribution was significantly more brutal than what we see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 6-12. Forli, Venice, and Barbarigo Conspiracy. 1480-1488*\n\nThis is a short bridging sequence where Ezio and Leonardo had to Venice. The year is now 1480. We also meet Caterina Sforza at Forli. **Caterina Sforza looks way older than she should be.** She was born in 1463, which means she's younger than Ezio but she looks his age/a little older somehow. She was around 17 or 18 in 1481, which means that Ezio should be more than a little creepy in hitting on a woman so much younger than him (albeit married with children...Caterina Sforza married at the age of 13, and gave birth to a kid in 15...so I think it's clear why Ubisoft felt they had to change that). **Leonardo is located in Venice for most of this sequence. At this time, he should be in Milan.** He did go to Venice but that was intermittent and in the 1490s. His biggest association was working at Milan between 1482-1499. **The game conveys the impression that Leonardo's career was Florence-then-Venice, when that wasn't the case at all**.\n\n**The Barbarigos were a real-life Venetian family and they were among the top 40 prominent families who divided the Dogeship for three centuries.** Emilio Barbarigo, your first Venetian target is fictional, as is Silvio Barbarigo who you kill later at L'Arsenale. But Marco Barbarigo, the Doge you attack at the Carnevale is real, and he did die in 1486 but he wasn't publicly assassinated like in this game. His replacement Agostino Barbarigo is real too, and yeah he did replace Marco. The Doge whose assassination you fail to prevent, Doge Mocenigo, also real and he died in the same year at thee Ducal Palace, and yeah there were rumors that he was poisoned, so that part is justified. Ezio's allies in Venice include the Thieves Gield (Antonio, Rosa) who are fictional, and the mercenary Bartolomeo d'Alviano who is a real-life figure and a mercenary in service to Venice, and who later did align with anti-Borgia families like the Orsini, so that part is fair. We meet Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia at Venice at the end. At this time, he was administrator at Cartagena, Spain.\n\n**We also get to see Niccolo Machiavelli who in 1488 was about 19 years of age**, but he looks younger than Ezio so there's that. At this point he should still be a student and early careerist in Florence, and not in Venice and Forli.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Sequence 13-15: Battle of Forli DLC and Bonfire of the Vanities DLC and Finale in Rome 1488-1499.*\n\nThese two sequences were originally released as DLC but subsequently reinserted into the GOTY release in its natural place (and that;s how I played it first time). Ludovico and Ceccho Orsi were real figures, but the entire order of their real actions and their activities here are inverted. The Orsis assassinated Girolamo Riario, Caterina Sforza's husband. There's no evidence in real life that she was the one who ordered her husband's hit as the game implies. The Orsis holding Caterina's children hostage and that exchange between her and them, is based on rumors but is credible enough but that happened after her husband's assassination. And if anything, the Orsis were allied with the Medici rather than the Borgia, since Girolamo Riario was the last of the Pazzi conspirators, and the main mastermind more-over. We also see a big siege of Forli and a castle battle that didn't happen at this time. The combat and style doesn't look convincing, too few soldiers and meagre equipment and whatnot.\n\nWe also see Savonarola at the end. He's presented as this unknown nobody. But **by 1485, Savonarola was already known in Florence for his sermons and speeches. He wasn't as unknown and secret as the game presents it.** The portrayal of Florence under Savonarola has him converting it into some kind of theocracy, with the Apple of Eden manipulating a few people to serve as his puppets. **In actual fact, Lorenzo de'Medici was responsible for Savonarola**. Lorenzo il Magnifico's final years in the 1480s, saw Medici Bank collapse, with branches in London and Bruges shut down. Lorenzo also started running out of wealth, so he started using state funds to live out his lavish lifestyle, his pageants, and parties. The entire Pazzi crisis and the years of paranoia and siege that followed, also saw an economic downturn in the city. Savonarola became popular precisely because his message coincided with that weak economy and political corruption. In the game, Savonarola's rise is blamed on Lorenzo's son Piero (who is unseen) but in fact it was Lorenzo's own fault.\n\n**Savonarola actually founded a more democratic republic than under the Medici.** He negotiated in person with the King of France and prevented a sacking of the city. This made him **personally popular**. In the game when Ezio returns the crowd chatters about things went worse under him, but that would not have been the opinion then. **He was fully supported by Pico della Mirandola, and by Sandro Botticelli**. In the game he governs via a police state with bonfire burnings across the city, but the bonfires were special events and had wide public support. The major one happened just once in 1497. Savonarola was certainly quite repressive and tried to pass more puritanical laws as time went on. So **I am not saying he was really some good guy who got a bad hand. But in the DLC, Ezio's targets are either manipulated stooges or cynical hucksters who joined with Savonarola for base motives, as if nobody had pure reasons for believing  in him and supporting him**. It was Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI since 1492, who moved against Savonarola and conspired for his death and execution. In the game Ezio gets that.\n\nThis is actually the end of the Florentine part of the story (aside from some flashbacks in Brotherhood side missions). I always felt that it was a major weakness of AC2 for the climax to downplay Florence by the finale. There's a reason why in GTA San Andreas, you returned to Los Santos after going to Las Venturas. **I think that AC2 would have been better served if rather than Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, you had Girolamo Riario and then Savonarola as the main villains.** **Because the Auditore family and the Medici are the main focus of the first section of the game and so Florence is the center of AC2**. The fact that the Medici and by extension the Auditore were potentially complicit in Savonarola's rise makes for a better story than what the game told. After all Giovanni Auditore, Ezio's Dad, is a banker who works with Lorenzo de'Medici, he had to know of his corruption and miserliness, and so on.\n\nThe finale of the game is obviously fictional. But yeah Rodrigo Borgia became Pope Alexander VI in 1492 and by 1499, when Ezio pays him a visit, he was settled in and was becoming quite a powerful and competent administrator. **The portrayal of the Sistine Chapel that we see here, is accurate**. No Michelangelo's ceiling because that is forever associated with Pope Julius II. Michelangelo was 24 in 1499 and in Florence, and that was the period when he sculpted David. To be absolutely clear, looking at the game now with all this detail, **I am not sure why Rodrigo Borgia is really the bad guy in AC2**. I mean yeah he's a name figure and everything. But most of the game takes place in Florence and Venice, and not in Rome. **Nothing about his actions in AC2 has anything to do with the real shady stuff he did in history.** So I will deal with the Borgia in Brotherhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**\n\n\\- For a while now, I have been thinking about and bothered with what I think is Ubisoft's Double Standard. Returning to Assasin's Creed II after playing AC3, Black Flag, Freedom Cry, Rogue, Unity, Syndicate, I can't help but notice a pattern, whereby **the Assassin's Creed games seems to imply that stuff like racism, slavery, and discrimination happens only in America and the New World and** ***not*** **in Europe.** The games basically emphasize Europe's architecture and other cities in a very touristy way, without any hint of the ugliness that was part of that time.\n\n\\- **Europe in the Middle Ages and especially in the Mediterranean practised slavery.** **The slaves were mostly Eastern European at first but by the end of the 14th Century started including Africans**. In fact the word slave comes from \"slav\" as in the Slavic people, a group that is today Europe's most populous ethnicity. Most slaves of this time were Russians, Tartars, Greeks, Bulgarians, basically the Balkan peoples. **Most of these slaves were women** and well their enslavement in households were obviously exploitative, **and the business in time became glorified human trafficking with all the horrible nastiness you can think of**. Slaves were of any religion, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish. **Slavery was more common in Venice than Florence, but even then the Medici owned slaves as did many other Florentine families.** It was considered a status symbol to own slaves in Europe, and it was a mark of privilege to do so. **Marco Polo who the game's lore reveals to be an Assassin was a slaveowner albeit someone who freed his slaves in his will.** Games like Asssassin's Creed III, Black Flag, Liberation, and Freedom Cry, and even Rogue, acknowledged slavery in America and the New World, and that is right and proper but it's kind of weird that the developers didn't touch on this because this is mentioned in virtually any book of Venice I found, and it's a widely known fact about it. **The scale of research done for Assassin's Creed II is such that the developers absolutely had to come across these facts when reading up on Venice, Florence and other places.** In AC1, because the focus on the crusades was so razor-thin and narrow, the leaving out details was justifiable and it made sense, but the expansion of scope and greater ambition means, that **what is excluded sticks out even more so in AC2.** The only thing close to slavery in AC2 is the case of Dante Moro but there it's more of a fantastic and baroque thing rather than an actual institutional evil that something even average people do.\n\n\\[EDIT: I scanted in this post, the presence and attitudes to prostitution in the game. But luckily for you all, u/Chamboz has put a detailed post on this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/73xces/assassins\\_creed\\_ii\\_and\\_the\\_erasure\\_of\\_womens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/73xces/assassins_creed_ii_and_the_erasure_of_womens/) brought to my attention by  [**u/cuc\\_AOE**](https://www.reddit.com/user/cuc_AOE/) \\].\n\n \\- I mentioned above that Leonardo da Vinci in 1476 was accused of sodomy and that originally developer Patrice Desilets wanted to include it but Ubisoft told him no. Had Leonardo been tried and found guilty of that charge, he would have been sentenced and burnt at the stake. **Homophobia was especially bad under Savonarola who enforced those laws more than the Medici did**. Though again there is no evidence that he actually sentenced anyone to death, but this led to more persecution and pressure and exile.\n\n\\- **The big elephant in the room is of course Anti-Semitism and the complete lack of Jewish characters.** The Renaissance is one of the most important periods for Jewish history. Jews in Florence were prominent supporters of the Medici and were protected by Lorenzo il Magnifico from fanatical clerics. **Jews faced persecution and orders of expulsion under Savonarola,** which isn't mentioned in the game once.  Jews in Venice had better treatment compared to other places, but even then Jews were only allowed to work in Venice and not live there, could be evicted from a moment's notice, and had to wear a yellow band in public. In 1515, years after the game, the Republic of Venice ordered that Jews could stay in a special area, a foundry scrap heap called \"getto\", from which we get the word ghetto, of which the Venetian ghetto is the first of its kind, for any group anywhere. But even in the 1480s, you still had a prominent presence of Jewish people in Venice, they were doctors, physicians, merchants, and scholars, exactly the kind of people Ezio hangs out with for most of the game. **The big problem with making Rodrigo Borgia the bad guy is precisely because one of his most notable actions as Pope, was allowing Jews exiled from Spain and Portuga 1492 to settle in Rome without fears of conversion**. He did that for pragmatic rather than entirely altruistic reasons, and some of that would be reversed under Cesare Borgia, but he did do it.\n\n\\- AC2 has more side-missions with narrative than AC1. Most of it is silly and deals with fictional characters. This includes the tombs, most of which is set inside famous landmarks but has weird mechanisms and so on that never existed in the real place. The exception is the Basilica di San Marco in Venice where the interiors reflect the real one inside well. The Database in AC2 is generally reliable and informative. So I don't think there are too many issues there, except again the lack of mention of the racism, slavery, and homophobia that was part of daily life.\n\n\\- **In terms of costumes, I think AC2 looks stagey**. Ezio's outfit in particular strikes me as being inappropriate for his rank. He's a nobleman and aristocrat and later he becomes a fugitive, so that means that when he is blending in \"rich areas\" and so on, he should wear the proper clothing and in poor areas, he should dress accordingly. This is a problem with all the games going forward, since historically, until the modern contemporary area (and even today it still counts), costumes and clothing were primary indicators of rank, class, and station. In addition to not dealing with the other stuff, **AC2 doesn't deal well with class either.** The only time Ubisoft does this is in Liberation, the side-game and there the costumes are a gendered thing as if men of all classes and stations never had to deal with any of this at any time.\n\n\\- **Architecturally**, the notable thing about AC2 compared to AC1 and later games is that it tries to avoid anachronism in a few notable instances. Rialto Bridge is wooden in Venice as opposed to the more refined one you see now. Sistine Chapel doesn't have Michelangelo's painting. This is of course unavoidable with stuff like Campanile of San Marco which in real life collapsed in an earthquake and was then reconstructed, and the Campanile here looks like that one rather than the real one. **The towers and buildings are also quite obviously compressed to be made climbable with hand and foot-holds**. San Gimignano should not be as easy to climb as it is in this game I think.\n\n\\- AC2 also has you collect art items for your Palazzo which is Old Master stuff that you can have the fantasy you own. From what I see, all of them look like Museum pictures today rather than an attempt to simulate the look and colours of that time based on contemporary reports and modern research.\n\n\\- In terms of language, AC2 has an English interspersed with Italian words and phrases. Most of it is swearing, and insults, but there doesn't seem to be any attempt at differentiation with dialect, when this was a big issue in Italian history. The Florentine dialect (which is the one that contemporary Italian is based on) versus Venetian, versus Romagna, and Rome. I have been told that the Italian is very bad and cliched, and laughable to native speakers.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nA major problem in retrospect with AC2 is that where in AC1, the Assassins and Templars played historical roles during the Crusades. Here they become metaphors. And those metaphors come from pieces of history and it's based on cliches. The major cliche of Renaissance Italy is proto-mafia feuding families, so now **the Assassins and Templars are Italian feuding families, the game is mostly about good noble families like the Auditores/Medici/Sforza versus the Borgia/Pazzi/Barbarigo**. What this means is that Assassin's Creed can't claim any neutrality about history. They pronounced judgment and decided that X is Good, and Y is Bad, and they do that, without giving good historical reasons to make that call. This is problematic when you consider **the real history of the Renaissance**, which is that **for Italy, this was a period of never-ending constant warfare.** The game focuses on small-scale assassinations but in actual fact many of these Italian families and local city-states would ally with rival powers to attack their own neighbours. Florence for instance allied with France for safety against the Pope, who in turn tried to get the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and Portugal on board. **All these feuding families ultimately screwed over Italy and in the next century, many of the artists, and artisans would leave Italy and work in safer climates outside.** The whole idea of there being a good family is ridiculous.\n\nSo that's that, I've finished UNITY, gone back to AC1, and now AC2. AC2 took longer than I thought it would. I am going to do AC3 next, then Syndicate, and Origins. I am going to skip Brotherhood and Revelations because most of the games there have very slight historical content being largely fictional, mostly the \"Borgia while not good weren't as bad\". They are also shorter. And most of the complaints I said about the portrayal of Renaissance Europe (the downplaying of slavery, racism, class, and so on) would be repeating what I wrote here. The main thing would be the architecture of Rome and Constantinople which is too specialized for me. BLACK FLAG is in my opinion the most accurate game but it's also a game like AC1 which doesn't have a lot to get wrong and most of my criticisms and complaints about the ship combat in Black Flag is true for the naval component of AC3, so I will discuss that there. ROGUE is not a game I like but it's also entirely fictional and lore-related in its game having little to do or say about the Seven Years War, which I will deal with in AC3 anyway.\n\nNot sure which order I will do it. I think I will do Syndicate, and then AC3. After that, Origins. Need to read up for all of those games but I know quite a bit about it. Or I can do it chronological.\n\nThat's that.

        "text": "Thanks to the responses of my post on the list of inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Unity\\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins\\_creed\\_unity\\_a\\_near\\_complete\\_list\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9d9ra2/assassins_creed_unity_a_near_complete_list_of/)\\],  I think I will do a series on the entire AC franchise, game by game.\n\n**My SOURCES are cited at the end of the article.**\n\nI judge the historical-narrative stuff based on the \"casual experience\". I am going to try and avoid being pedantic. I am going to be fair if I think/judge that the games are fair. I am going to do it by using Ubisoft's own rules:\n\n1. The **30-second wikipedia rule** that Desilets/Jade Raymond and others talked about. If something can be checked in 30secs and can be verified than AC will stick to the facts but anything beyond that they will change.\n2. **If the games provide a truer and more accurate picture than the most famous Pop-Culture View**. For instance, if you are making a game about pirates, you have to be more accurate than Johnny Depp movies, that's **the simple low bar**. In am also going to be fair in identifying what I think people's familiar idea of a period is at the start of each game so that people know what my standards are.\n\nSo let's begin. Assassin's Creed 1 doesn't have many side missions aside from collecting flags (sigh), the liberation missions, and so on. It doesn't have a database so there isn't too much to look at. Most of the plot is basic and is fictional, so I am focusing on that mainly. I have added sources at the end.\n\n**ASSASSIN'S CREED 1**\n\n***Setting***: The Third Crusade, The Levant (Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre, \"the Kingdom\", Masyaf) in the Year 1191 AD, or CE for you secular folk.\n\n***Most Common Pop-Culture Idea*** *of the Crusades/Richard I/The Templars/Assassins*: Kingdom of Heaven/Da Vinci Code/Alamut/Ivanhoe\n\n***Main Campaign***: Tamir, Talal, Majd-Addin, Abu'l Nuqood are all fictional characters, as is the Apple of Eden, so I am not going to deal with that much. I will start with the characters and situations, based on historical figures and go from there.\n\n\\- Garnier de Nablus (called Naplouse in the game) died in 1192. Garnier de Naplouse's characterization here is invented for the game though I think is roughly metaphorical for the attitudes towards mentally ill and so on. But there's nothing in history to say that he didn't do this I guess.\n\n\\- William de Montferrat did die in 1191 and he died in Tyre and not in Acre as in this game. He wasn't assassinated. His more famous son Conrad of Montferrat was assassinated, but in 1192 and also in Tyre. The real Conrad was killed by the historical Assassins and there were rumors at the time that King Richard I ordered the hit but the king denied it and so on and historically there's no evidence one-way or the other.\n\n\\- Before the Assassination mission of William at Acre, we see King Richard I castigating him for executing those prisoners of Muslims. In real history, Richard I ordered the executions of those prisoners, which triggered Saladin to execute Christian prisoners in his captivity.\n\n\\- Jubair is based on Ibn Jubayr who died decades later in 1217 and not 1191, but the real Jubair was a scholar, traveler and historian, and the weird book burning psycho in the game is a total travesty of the real guy.\n\n\\- Sibrand indeed died in 1191 at Acre. So that's about the only case for the time and place of death is entirely in synch in this game. The manner in which he died is made up, as is everything else about him, but there's not much more information about him.\n\n\\- Robert de Sable died in 1193 after the game and not in Trial by Combat.\n\n\\- Al Mualim's name is never mentioned in AC1 but later lore and context confirms that he is Rashid-ad-din Sinan, who again died in 1193 and not in 1191 in the year of this game.\n\nGeneral Open-World/World-Building Observations across main missions and free roam.\n\n\\- Stuff like Majd Addin being a governor of psycho judge of Jerusalem and murdering people willy-nilly and his funeral being attended by Templars and \"publicly\" by Robert de Sable in full regalia and crosses is a huge stretch. At the time of the Third Crusade, the Templars were in the armies of King Richard I and Robert de Sable never left his side.\n\n\\- You hear street-criers in Damascus and Jerusalem (under Saracen occupation) talk about the Crusades. Now **the word \"Crusade\" wasn't used by anyone back then**. The Europeans called it \"iter\" or \"peregrenatio\" i.e. pilgrimage. The Saracens, the Arabs, and the Kurds of the medieval era did not call that. They called the entire conflict \"the Frankish Wars\". They never adopted the Crusades until the 19th Century and the period of colonialism. Now this could be a translator's thing or whatnot but if people are complaining about Byzantine/Eastern Roman in Revelations, then it applies here too.\n\n\\- **AC1 gives the impression** in general, or **at least to me, that Altair is somehow an anti-Crusader fellow** or he wants to get the foreigners out of the land. **The historical Assassins never held that attitude** and in fact the contrary. They were not on anyone's side and **there's more evidence of them allying with the Crusaders and conquering army than with the natives**. The Assassins had a hate-on for Saladin and after the entire Richard I/Conrad fiasco, Rashid ad-din Sinan wrote a letter taking credit for the hit and claiming that Richard I had nothing to do with it, solely as a favour to the Crusaders.\n\n\\- **The Templars in general were not this serious conspirators** the game makes them out to be. **They often counselled caution to Richard I** and he ignored them. They were **often more moderate** and wanted to get some accommodation. And  there is **not the slightest evidence of the Templars and Assassins being opposed to each other historically** especially in the time period of the Third Crusade which is the only moment in history both of them shared the same air.\n\n\\- Practically everything we know about the historical assassins comes from their enemies and from outsiders so we don't have too much insight into them and their organization. **The games follow the recent historical tendency** whereby Assassins are called Asasiyun (by Malik especially) and not Hashashin since recent historians think the whole idea of Assassins smoking hashish was invented by their enemies. So in that respect, the game is more accurate than Alamut by Vladimir Bartol which Desilets said inspired the series. But on the other hand, Alamut also dealt with the main branch of the Assassins which was in Iran and not in Syria. **The Iranian Assassins were a much bigger deal than Masyaf**, and it also features the Assassins attacking local corrupt authorities. In real-history, their hits on Conrad Montferrat and other Crusaders were contract-killings and not fight-the-power ideology. That ideology applied and was concentrated mainly in Iran.\n\n\\- **The particular idea in this game is that the Crusades were a side-step to a real conflict between secular-humanist secret societies** posing as religious sects, i.e. Assassins/Templars. This **is ridiculous** and obviously a commercial decision. The crusades was a religious conflict in main and while the religious mentality intersected with geopolitical, economic, and other decisions, and there was pragmatism and back-and-forth, the idea that they weren't religious is insupportable. Likewise, the particular modern idea and disgust against the religious fanaticism of the Crusades voiced by Abul Nuqood and even some Templars, or Jubair who burns books because the Bible and Koran caused the Crusades would not have been shared at that time. That is a more Early Modern-Enlightenment concept and not one in the Middle Ages. Now I suppose it was possible people felt that way then and did voice it, and I think people did do that at the time but to do it repeatedly is stretching it. People back then didn't like war but if anything people who didn't like war liked the Crusades because they saw it as a war with purpose, i.e. a war of pilgrimage\n\n\\- **Saladin isn't in the game but he's framed as a relatively benign figure** in the game. **Recent historians have seen Saladin more critically**. Saladin was someone who united multiple groups in the cause of \"jihad\" against the Cruaders. Until Saladin, the local Middle-Eastern rulers, people, and denizens saw the Crusades as \"Frankish Wars\" and as a side-show. They didn't see it in the way the Crusaders saw it, but that changed with Saladin who conjured an Islamic mentality parallel to that of Crusaders. Now **he had tolerance and some virtues but** basically, **Saladin is the** **one of the early precursors of a more militant formulation of jihad**. So if the game lent into that, you could have had a more complex story whereby the Asasiyun were holdouts against Saladin's unifying centralizing tendency of claiming to speak for all Muslims whereas they pursued their own interests and local grudges, allying with any side, no matter it be Crusader, Templar, or anyone. It would also create a situation where the militants in the mountain are fighting against jihad in the city. It would have been awesome I think and shown some daring.\n\n\\- **Richard I is shown as a bit of an asshole.** Not without nobility, but he's shown as more of a jerk here than in the Robin Hood movies, **which is fair** Unlike the recent whitewashing you see with the accents in Unity, **he speaks English with a light French accent and this is the most accurate portrayal in that regards.** The real Richard I was King of England in the Angevin era, when England had territory in Continental France, and were Dukes of Angevin and Kings of England, being also vassals of the King of France (an issue that later led to war with Philip II and much later the Hundred Years War). In real-life Richard I spent most of his life in Continental France, Europe, and little in England. **He did not speak English fluently, and mostly spoke French**, which was also the language of government for England in this time. So that part is right and more accurate than other versions of Richard I you see in popular movies.\n\n\\- **In terms of costumes**, **I imagine the real assassins didn't wear bespoke white robes** and so on. Given their whole blend-in and then march and kill targets in broad daylight in a suicide-run thing that is documented, I think they dressed casual and wore what was common and passed beneath sight much like the historical ninja of Japan who dressed like servants and menial labourers since that allowed them to pass beneath suspicion. In the case of the Templars, **every Templar we see in this game is wearing the legendary white surcoat** over chainmail/hauberk **with a Red Cross** on their chest. **In real history, only a small minority of Templars dressed that way**. Only annointed Knights, mostly aristocrats wore white. The majority of Templars were foot-soldiers or serjeants who dressed in black. You also had Templar chaplains who wore green.  So there's not a proper detail in costumes there. The other orders we see briefly, the Hospitalers and the Teutonic Knights, I guess they are okay, but I am not qualified about that. **I don't know about the costumes of the Saracens** but they look right. Light clothing for more movement (although the gameplay doesn't convey that), and **at least we see them using straight swords rather than scimitars** like practically every other medieval Middle-East setting.\n\n\\- In **terms of architecture and city-planning**, **I am not qualified** to fully address that here. **So anyone who can suggest and add on,** or clarify what I am going to say is welcome. \\[**EDIT**: The poster u/Anthemius_Augustus has suggested [this link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuaLEJlFw2gOrYN3FOXrHxL-MooUNv67M) a series of videos on architecture in this game and other AC games. Also [discussed in this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9dq6uy/historical_inaccuracy_in_assassins_creed_series/e5k9x5q/?context=3) by same poster\\]. In any case I doubt the real cities of Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre were segregated on to a grid in Poor/Rich/Middle districts. AC1 didn't go heavy in monuments but we see the Ummayad Mosque in Damascus, the Dome of the Rock, and Church of the Holy Sepulchre. **It's largely anachronistic**, with developers admitting that they drew on illustrations from the 18th Century. **The Dome of the Rock has a gold plate which was in real-life added in 1959 and not in the time of Saladin.** I believe that the Dome for most of its history and at the Crusader era was black in colour. The biggest howler is of course **the entirely fictional gothic cathedral in Acre.** The gothic style began some fifty years before 1191, at the Cathedral of St. Denis (which we see in Unity's DLC), but it was definitely not exported outside of France and England for the first two hundred years and certainly not all the way to Outremer. Masyaf Castle is a real place and it looks fine in the game but I have no idea if it matches what was there at the time, since it fell to the Mongols and so on.\n\n\\- Since most of the game is focused on Altair's quest to hunt the 9 (+1) Templars, and everything goes to the main quest with little density in the supporting cast and other points of view that we see in the side missions of later games, **I don't have too much problems with the issue of diversity in AC1 but it's worth addressing,** especially in retrospect, given the pattern in later games, it kind of becomes problematic. The fact is that **we don't have any Jewish characters in the game**, main and supporting. The only acknowledgement of their presence is the Synagogue in Jerusalem. The Crusades was a major event in Jewish history and the fact that we don't see anti-semitism anywhere on the part of either Crusader and/or Saracen is disingenuous and inaccurate. **That's fine though** **given the smaller focus and stakes in the game.** Unlike the later games, we don't get a sense that Ubisoft is trying to cover a big representative swathe of the period in AC1. We don't have many women in the game but it's nice to see Maria Thorpe as an acknowledgement of the phenomenon from the medieval to the early-20th Century of there being women pose as men to join the army. Ideally given her background and so on, she should be serjeant and not close to Robert de Sable since this is still feudal europe where rank and all that mattered.\n\n\\- **We don't get any sense of diversity within the Saracens**, like Shias and Sunnis and other smaller sub-sects, of which the historical Assassins were one. We get a sense of the multiple crusading organizations and factions, like Hospitalers, Templars, Teutons, and Richard I's army, but the Saracens are all treated as one, when in real-history, **the Saracen side spent more time fighting each other than the Franks** and indeed **saw the European Crusades as a side-show** to their own power games. **Saladin had to do a lot of heavy lifting** to get them together, and even then that collapsed when he died, and later **you had unity under Baibars who repelled the Mongols, way bigger deal for the Arabs** than the Crusaders ever were.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nSo on the whole I think AC1's portrayal of the Third Crusades and Levant is a mixed bag. The main virtue of AC1, having an Arab protagonist is undercut by the fact that Altair is plainly not a practicing and believing Muslim, the way Bayek of Siwa is a practicing polytheist. It kind of smacks of a certain double standard whereby you create an acceptable-to-the-West version of a certain figure of a culture rather than someone who is actually part of an entirely different culture and attitude. The later games have Altair having a Muslim father and a Christian mother, both being Arabs which is possible but it goes against the whole \"Altair ibn-L'ahad\" son of no-one in the first game.\n\nI would call AC1 fair because of its small focus, modest intentions, and I think it's still one of the very best games in the series for its gameplay, style, presentation, and character. It's also legitimately surreal...like most of the game feels naturalistic but then in the finale you have the Apple of Eden and it becomes fantasy/science-fiction which fades in the later games when you have stuff like Leonardo Gadgets and Earthquake Machines, Grand Temple, Observatory, which are all front-loaded in the games rather than placed at the end.\n\nIs it more accurate than Kingdom of Heaven which takes place a little before the events here? I would say near-abouts since that movie also sanitizes Bailin of Ibelin and so on. The Richard Lionheart here is still a sanitized figure since his major war crime is given to a Templar but it's presentation is fairer than Robin Hood. The portrayal of Assassins is in some cases more accurate than Alamut, but in other cases less so. It's truer than Ivanhoe.\n\nIt's focus on conspiracy and Templars is straight from The Da-Vinci Code, but in that book, the Templars are the good guys whereas here they are the bad guys. Is it better or fair? I don't know to be honest. But chalk one up to Dan Brown, he probably portrayed a more accurate Templar than Ubisoft did, though his portrayal of Assassins in Angels and Demons is worse than here.\n\nSo that's that. If you've stuck this far, tell me what you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***SOURCES:***\n\n1. *Holy Warriors: A Modern History of the Crusades.* Jonathan Philips. 2009.

        "text": "[Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/9cz0gc/christopher_jon_bjerknes_part_1/)\n\nWell, here we are. The blog of Christopher Jon Bjerknes. For background to who he is, look at Part 1. This post is long enough without a background. Anyway though, according to his blog he's published a new book! \"WARNINGS TO THE JEWS! PREMONITIONS OF THE HOLOCAUST\" (with capitalization) is now available! Well, he did say to spread the word. He never specified where.\n\nAnyway, he apparently has realized that no-one will buy his books, so he literally put his entire argument in the description. I'm putting it here to save you from having to actually go to his blog.\n\nAnd it somehow got worse than what we already had. I don't know how, but it did.\n\n&gt;From 1900 through 1920, Jewish leaders, including Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and Max Nordau warned Jewry that six million Jews faced extermination in Eastern Europe. The causes they named varied from \"German terror\", to \"Russian anti-Semitism\", to \"mass starvation\". Jewish relief organizations raised funds to feed and clothe the Jews. Zionists petitioned to move them to Palestine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Whether entirely guilty, partially responsible, or completely innocent, the rest of the world openly blamed the Jews for the Armenian Genocide which claimed 1.5 million lives, and for the Bolshevik mass murder of tens of millions. Adolf Hitler repeatedly stated that the reason why he attacked the Jews, was because he personally held them responsible for the Bolshevik slaughter of thirty million innocent human beings by 1923. Several concerned people made numerous attempts from 1911 through 1922 to warn the Jews that a massive pogrom awaited European Jewry as a consequence of their alleged, as well as proven, participation in Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These dire warnings had the exact opposite of the intended effect on world Jewry. Jewish leaders argued that the best means to prevent an extermination pogrom was to keep the philo-Semitic Bolsheviks in power, regardless of the crimes they were committing against humanity. In this way, the Bolshevists and the Jewish bankers who put them in power used their crimes against humanity as an excuse to remain in power, solicit aid from those they sought to subvert, and commit more such acts of genocide. Instead of heeding this cautionary advice and perhaps helping to prevent the Holocaust as well as sparing Eastern Europe and other regions of the world the future communist genocide of 100 million souls, organized Jewry opted to scapegoat Germany for the mass murder of Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide, and vehemently denied the well established and extensive Jewish involvement in these inhuman atrocities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Jewish bankers used their crimes as an excuse to keep their murderous hordes in power in the Soviet Union. They indemnified the Bolsheviks with the very blood they had spilled, because they did not want their efforts to ruin Russia and Eastern Europe to be in vain. They basically stated that, \"You can not depose the Jews, because they have killed 30 million people and the nations will retaliate against the Jews for those atrocities. So in the name of humanity, you must keep the murdering Jews in power to murder more, lest they be murdered themselves.\" Of course, this was just a show for the public to justify Allied support for the Soviet Union, which was a foregone conclusion. The Jewish bankers had the power to keep the Bolsheviks they put in power, in power, because they controlled American President Woodrow Wilson through blackmail for his affair with Mrs. Peck, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George through his religious Zionist ties to Lord Rothschild, and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau through the puppetry of another Rothschild, Louis George Rothschild, a.k.a. Georges Mandel. Even if there were no threat of retaliation against the Jewish masses for the crimes of the Bolsheviks and bankers, they would have simply manufactured a different excuse to keep their regime in place.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rather than try to end Bolshevism, organized Jewry came to the aid of the failing Soviet Union they had created and sought to sustain. The Jews lobbied Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Lloyd George and Clemenceau to prevent the Allies from intervening on behalf of the Russian people against the Bolsheviks, and on the contrary instigated these leaders to rescue the crumbling Bolshevik Empire in the name of protecting 6 million Jews from pogroms, which these men then did by formally recognizing, trading with, and supplying massive aid to the collapsing Soviet Union. In this way, leading Jews used their genocidal crimes as a pretext to keep their criminal agents in power in Russia, sophistically arguing that it was necessary for the Bolsheviks to remain in power in order to prevent any retaliation against Jews for those same crimes, while ignoring the peril they themselves posed to hundred of millions of non-Jewish lives, and covering up their own guilt for already having mass murdered tens of millions of Russians. They then proceeded to amplify their murderous campaign and open threats to take over the world and had the American people paying for it, all in the name of protecting the Jews, but in complete disregard for Russian life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This ultimately resulted in World War Two, the Holocaust, the Communist extermination of one hundred million more human beings, the spread of Communism to all of Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and Cambodia, and in the Cold War which threatened to end all human life. As many had predicted by 1920, the day of reckoning for allegedly brutally murdering several tens of millions of helpless innocents was not far off for Eastern European Jewry, as was the Bolshevik genocide of 100,000,000 more defenseless men, women, children and infants as genocidal Marxism spread its wings and dragged its claws around the globe.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Republished newspaper articles and letters to the editor, chiefly from the Times of London in 1911, 1919 and the first half of 1920, suffice to prove that the Jews were warned that they would be generally and severely punished for the crimes of the Bolsheviks and Young Turks if they did not assist with all their might and influence to bring them to a quick end, whether or not they were actually in any way guilty. This extensive documentation also exhibits the organized Jewish response in support of Bolshevism, both due to its ideological affinity to Judaism and to prevent the coming pogrom. It shows the evidence that was brought forth to demonstrate the grossly disproportionate and predominate role Jews played in both Bolshevism and Young Turkism. Republished official government reports from Western Europe and America name the Jews involved in creating, financing, supporting, sustaining, promoting and leading Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide and identify the imminent danger that Bolshevism posed to the world, as well as detailing the atrocities Bolsheviks and Young Turks had and were committing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was a concerted effort from 1900 to 1922 among leading Jews, the American and British governments, and socialist and communist elements in the press, to accuse Germany of attempting to create a vast Eastern empire by putting the Bolsheviks in power, knowing that when they fell, the Russians would engage in massive pogroms against the Jews which would turn the West against Russia. The Germans would then use this antagonism against Russia as a pretext to take over all of Eastern Europe and de-Russify it with the full support of the Allies. It appears that those who made these false allegations were covertly setting Germany up to carry out the desired pogroms, which would then turn the West against Germany and create Western support for a Bolshevik take over of Eastern Europe to de-Nazify it, with the full support of the Allies. The unprecedented pogrom would also generate support for the Jewish invasion of Palestine. After the assassination of Kurt Eisner, the Bolsheviks sent Adolf Hitler in to infiltrate the German counter-revolutionaries and create a stalking horse for the communist take over of Europe and the Zionist take over of Palestine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where did the mystical figure 6 million come from? It came from the Bible, in the book of *Leviticus* which states, \"you shall return\" with the cryptic numerical message interpreted by Jewish scholars of the Hebrew gematria to mean \"you shall return minus 6--million\" kind of like 6 iotas of difference. Jewry has engaged in a tremendous censorship campaign and has been waging war on the public's right to know for 73 years. The mass media constantly harp on the harm done to Jews in the Holocaust, but never discuss the more than one hundred million victims of Bolshevik genocide, nor the fact that Jews organized and orchestrated the Armenian Genocide. Obviously, they seek to portray Jewry as if innocent victims who have never done harm to anyone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;More on all that later, for now, let's directly address the divine number 6,000,000. Rabbi Benjamin Blech wrote in his book *The Secrets of Hebrew Words*:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"These are the words chosen to be inscribed on the Liberty Bell. It is in the Jubilee year that 'ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family.'The Hebrew word for 'ye shall return,' (TaShuVU), seems to be spelled incorrectly. Grammatically it requires another (vav). It ought to read (TaShUVU).Why is it lacking the letter (vav), which stands for 6? (TaShuVU) (without the 'vav') is a prediction to the Jewish people of ultimate return to their national homeland. (TaShuVU) in numbers adds up to 708: (tav) = 400,(shin) = 300, (vet) = 2, (vav) = 6). When we write the year, we ignore the millennia. In 1948 on the secular calendar, we witnessed the miracle of Jewish return to Israel. On the Hebrew calendar it was the year 5708. That was the year predicted by the incomplete word (TaShuVU), you shall return. We did return, lacking 6--an all-important 6 million of our people who perished during the Holocaust.Yet the fulfillment of the prediction of return in precisely that year implied by the gematria of (TaShuVU) gives us firm hope that the words of the Prophets for Final Redemption will come true as well.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ben Weintraub called attention to the fact that this exposition on the significance of the phrase \"you shall return\" explained why the Jews insist that six million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust, not one more, not one less, in his book *The Holocaust Dogma Of Judaism*. The gematria of the Hebrew phrase \"ye shall return\" is supposedly deliberately misspelled to indicate that the Jews would return to Palestine minus 6 million Jews in the year 1948.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So now that we know why the number six million was chosen, we have the right and the obligation to ask when it was chosen. Don Heddesheimer's book *The First Holocaust: Jewish Fund Raising Campaigns with Holocaust Claims During and After World War I* and *Six Million Open Gates* by S.A.R. Lynch demonstrate that Jewry were claiming that 6 million Jews were about to be exterminated in Eastern Europe at least as early as 1900, long before Adolf Hitler came to power, but not long after Theodor Herzl published the Zionist treatise *The Jewish State* in 1896 calling for the Jews to return to Palestine. For this to happen, according to prophecy, six million Jews had to perish.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Jews not only repeatedly stated that 6 million Jews were about to be exterminated in the period from 1900 to 1922, they believed this was a necessary step towards the conquest of Palestine from the Arabs and the ingathering of the Jews in Palestine. Now, they would have us believe that it was just a mere coincidence that shortly after they predicted 6 million Jews would die in Eastern Europe while holding to the prophecy that the Jews would only return minus 6 million, a Bolshevik blow-hard named Adolf Hitler rose from nowhere to rule Germany after infiltrating the counter-revolutionary DAP shortly after the assassination of Hitler's hero the Bolshevik Jew Kurt Eisner. Hitler, supposedly coincidentally, provided the Zionists with the pogrom they were openly predicting. Not only that, but he supposedly gave them the 6,000,000 corpse tally they needed for their god's green light to genocide the Palestinians and take their country. And just coincidentally, the Jews took Palestine right after Hitler did his deeds. And not only that, but they have made it illegal in many countries to question the mystical figure six million with scientific facts, and have censored every voice telling the truth about discrepancies in the figures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What are the Jews hiding?\n\nOh my f\\*\\*king god.\n\nWHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN?!?!?!?!\n\nAlright, let's try this.\n\n&gt;From 1900 through 1920, Jewish leaders, including Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and Max Nordau warned Jewry that six million Jews faced extermination in Eastern Europe. The causes they named varied from \"German terror\", to \"Russian anti-Semitism\", to \"mass starvation\". Jewish relief organizations raised funds to feed and clothe the Jews. Zionists petitioned to move them to Palestine.\n\nI looked up \"stephen s wise holocaust warning\" on Google, and this blog post was the second result. The first was a [post on the official US Holocaust Memorial Museum's Holocaust Encyclopedia](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/stephen-s-wise-18741949). It detailed how Stephen S Wise utterly failed during the Holocaust. He sunk many negotiations that could have saved Jews, most famously Japan's attempt to settle Jews in Manchuria. His dogmatic faith in FDR doomed many Jews who could otherwise have been saved.\n\nMax Nordau is more interesting. I found exactly a single source besides this (which was also the second result on Google there), on the [Jewish Virtual Library's biography of M](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nordau-max)[ax Nordau](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nordau-max) (weirdly enough, JVL also has a [second, separate biography of Nordau](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/max-nordau)). It says:\n\n&gt;At the Congress of 1911 he warned that if current political trends persisted, six million Jews, i.e., those living in the Russian Empire and other East-European countries, were doomed to perish. He was convinced that only political Zionism could forestall the tragedy.\n\nThe only other thing I can find is [this Holocaust denial essay](http://www.naturalmoney.org/sixmillionjews.html). So yeah, a single reference. Not the most reliable.\n\nBut let's say for a minute that this source was correct and he did say it (which I can accept seeing as the source is a Jewish one). Even then, this is saying absolutely nothing; the European Jewish population was 9.5 million, of which Eastern Europe made up about 6.5 million, i.e., the six million number was just the number of Jews in Eastern Europe who would potentially die. It was political talk, nothing more.\n\n&gt;Whether entirely guilty, partially responsible, or completely innocent, the rest of the world openly blamed the Jews for the Armenian Genocide which claimed 1.5 million lives, and for the Bolshevik mass murder of tens of millions. Adolf Hitler repeatedly stated that the reason why he attacked the Jews, was because he personally held them responsible for the Bolshevik slaughter of thirty million innocent human beings by 1923. Several concerned people made numerous attempts from 1911 through 1922 to warn the Jews that a massive pogrom awaited European Jewry as a consequence of their alleged, as well as proven, participation in Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide.\n\nAh, the Armenian Genocide, the topic of the previous post. Anyway though, I can't find any source for Jews being blamed for the Armenian Genocide in this time period. The Bolsheviks, sure. Much of the Western world did, in fact, blame the Jews for that. Hitler did, in fact, cite this as one of his reasons for the Holocaust. However, this is a massive misunderstanding. Hitler believed that the Jews were parasites on society; Communism was simply an example.\n\nI have no clue where the \"concerned people\" who warned the Jews from 1911 to 1922. The earliest explicit warning for the Holocaust is Hayim Weizmann, who warned in 1936 and 1939 that up to a quarter of Eastern European were under threat from the Nazis.\n\n&gt;These dire warnings had the exact opposite of the intended effect on world Jewry. Jewish leaders argued that the best means to prevent an extermination pogrom was to keep the philo-Semitic Bolsheviks in power, regardless of the crimes they were committing against humanity. In this way, the Bolshevists and the Jewish bankers who put them in power used their crimes against humanity as an excuse to remain in power, solicit aid from those they sought to subvert, and commit more such acts of genocide.\n\nWhat \"philo-Semitic Bolsheviks\" are you talking about here? The Bolsheviks despised the Jews. The insane number of assimilated Jews in the Bolshevik movement led to intense hate of any Jews who weren't fully assimilated. Unlike in Germany, it wasn't the Jewish race that the Soviets hated, it was Jewish beliefs. However, THAT'S STILL ANTISEMITISM.\n\nThe primary example of pre-Stalin antisemitism is August 1919, when synagogues were appropriated by the Bolsheviks and many rabbis were forced to resign under threats of violence.\n\nThere is one way in which the Soviets were anti-antisemitic; race-based antisemitism. However, under Stalin, even this became nothing more than lip service. And even with this, the Bolsheviks were NOT philo-Semitic.\n\n&gt;Instead of heeding this cautionary advice and perhaps helping to prevent the Holocaust as well as sparing Eastern Europe and other regions of the world the future communist genocide of 100 million souls, organized Jewry opted to scapegoat Germany for the mass murder of Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide, and vehemently denied the well established and extensive Jewish involvement in these inhuman atrocities.\n\nWait, what? When was Germany ever blamed for Bolshevism ~~and the Armenian Genocide~~? EDIT: u/Idontknowmuch has informed me that Germany was in fact complicit in the Armenian Genocide.\n\nAlso, CJB kinda just went back on his earlier \"Whether entirely guilty, partially responsible, or completely innocent\".\n\nAnd wasn't their goal here to stop the Holocaust?\n\n&gt;The Jewish bankers used their crimes as an excuse to keep their murderous hordes in power in the Soviet Union. They indemnified the Bolsheviks with the very blood they had spilled, because they did not want their efforts to ruin Russia and Eastern Europe to be in vain. They basically stated that, \"You can not depose the Jews, because they have killed 30 million people and the nations will retaliate against the Jews for those atrocities. So in the name of humanity, you must keep the murdering Jews in power to murder more, lest they be murdered themselves.\"\n\nWhat efforts to ruin Russia and Eastern Europe? Weren't they trying to prevent the Holocaust?\n\nOK, so now the West will suddenly care about a massacre of Jews. You know, like they didn't do about the Holocaust. There's a myth that the West didn't know about the Holocaust. It's just that, a myth. The news of the Holocaust was stuffed in the middle of the New York Times (the NYT's coverage of the Holocaust is a whole other story, but an irrelevant one). And even if they didn't, they refused to accept Jewish refugees; Canada's prime minister was quoted as saying \"No Jews is too much.\" And now these people care about a much lesser Jewish massacre.\n\n&gt;Of course, this was just a show for the public to justify Allied support for the Soviet Union, which was a foregone conclusion.\n\nWait, what? The Allies had absolutely no interest in helping the Soviets until they had to. For instance, they (sorta pathetically) helped Finland in the Winter War.\n\n&gt;The Jewish bankers had the power to keep the Bolsheviks they put in power, in power, because they controlled American President Woodrow Wilson through blackmail for his affair with Mrs. Peck, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George through his religious Zionist ties to Lord Rothschild, and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau through the puppetry of another Rothschild, Louis George Rothschild, a.k.a. Georges Mandel.\n\nThe Jews control the rulers of the US, Britain, and France. I'm not even bothering with this.\n\n&gt;Even if there were no threat of retaliation against the Jewish masses for the crimes of the Bolsheviks and bankers, they would have simply manufactured a different excuse to keep their regime in place.\n\nFor the third time, wasn't the Jews' whole goal to prevent the Holocaust?\n\n&gt;Rather than try to end Bolshevism, organized Jewry came to the aid of the failing Soviet Union they had created and sought to sustain. The Jews lobbied Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Lloyd George and Clemenceau to prevent the Allies from intervening on behalf of the Russian people against the Bolsheviks, and on the contrary instigated these leaders to rescue the crumbling Bolshevik Empire in the name of protecting 6 million Jews from pogroms, which these men then did by formally recognizing, trading with, and supplying massive aid to the collapsing Soviet Union.\n\nUm, the Allies did intervene in the Russian Civil War, in the Siberian Intervention (and to a lesser extent in Murmansk). They just did it really badly, and had no effect (except Japan). And they didn't fund the Bolsheviks at all (unless you want to consider the Czechoslovak Legion paying ransom to get out of Siberia, which I don't quite think was the intention).\n\n&gt;In this way, leading Jews used their genocidal crimes as a pretext to keep their criminal agents in power in Russia, sophistically arguing that it was necessary for the Bolsheviks to remain in power in order to prevent any retaliation against Jews for those same crimes, while ignoring the peril they themselves posed to hundred of millions of non-Jewish lives, and covering up their own guilt for already having mass murdered tens of millions of Russians. They then proceeded to amplify their murderous campaign and open threats to take over the world and had the American people paying for it, all in the name of protecting the Jews, but in complete disregard for Russian life.\n\nDid you notice it? Let me post that again.\n\n&gt;In this way, leading Jews used their genocidal crimes as a pretext to keep their criminal agents in power in Russia, sophistically arguing that it was necessary for the Bolsheviks to remain in power in order to prevent any retaliation against Jews for those same crimes, while ignoring the peril they themselves posed to hundred of millions of non-Jewish lives, and covering up their own guilt for already having mass murdered tens of millions of Russians. They then proceeded to amplify their murderous campaign and ***open threats to take over the world*** and had the American people paying for it, all in the name of protecting the Jews, but in complete disregard for Russian life.\n\nWHAT OPEN THREATS?!?!\n\n&gt;This ultimately resulted in World War Two, the Holocaust, the Communist extermination of one hundred million more human beings, the spread of Communism to all of Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and Cambodia, and in the Cold War which threatened to end all human life. As many had predicted by 1920, the day of reckoning for allegedly brutally murdering several tens of millions of helpless innocents was not far off for Eastern European Jewry, as was the Bolshevik genocide of 100,000,000 more defenseless men, women, children and infants as genocidal Marxism spread its wings and dragged its claws around the globe.\n\nWait, what had Eastern European Jewry done that this was their recompense? Weren't the Jewish bankers and politicians behind all of this?\n\nAnd get rid of that \"allegedly\". You've spent this whole time talking about this; that \"allegedly\" has no place here. This piece is allegedly wrong.\n\n&gt;Republished newspaper articles and letters to the editor, chiefly from the Times of London in 1911, 1919 and the first half of 1920, suffice to prove that the Jews were warned that they would be generally and severely punished for the crimes of the Bolsheviks and Young Turks if they did not assist with all their might and influence to bring them to a quick end, whether or not they were actually in any way guilty. This extensive documentation also exhibits the organized Jewish response in support of Bolshevism, both due to its ideological affinity to Judaism and to prevent the coming pogrom. It shows the evidence that was brought forth to demonstrate the grossly disproportionate and predominate role Jews played in both Bolshevism and Young Turkism. Republished official government reports from Western Europe and America name the Jews involved in creating, financing, supporting, sustaining, promoting and leading Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide and identify the imminent danger that Bolshevism posed to the world, as well as detailing the atrocities Bolsheviks and Young Turks had and were committing.\n\nWhat the hell are you talking about? Can I have copies of these articles, letters, and official government reports?\n\nJews did in fact make up a disproportionately large portion of the Bolsheviks (but not the Young Turks). This was because they'd spent the last REALLY LONG TIME being oppressed and being treated equally appealed to them. Not because they wanted to kill all Eastern Europe or an \"ideological affinity\".\n\n&gt;There was a concerted effort from 1900 to 1922 among leading Jews, the American and British governments, and socialist and communist elements in the press, to accuse Germany of attempting to create a vast Eastern empire by putting the Bolsheviks in power, knowing that when they fell, the Russians would engage in massive pogroms against the Jews which would turn the West against Russia. The Germans would then use this antagonism against Russia as a pretext to take over all of Eastern Europe and de-Russify it with the full support of the Allies. It appears that those who made these false allegations were covertly setting Germany up to carry out the desired pogroms, which would then turn the West against Germany and create Western support for a Bolshevik take over of Eastern Europe to de-Nazify it, with the full support of the Allies. The unprecedented pogrom would also generate support for the Jewish invasion of Palestine.\n\nSo it's not just the Jews playing 6D chess. The Americans and Brits are doing it too. Also, what \"Jewish invasion of Palestine\"? The Jews were mostly already living in established communities by then, and were no longer creating new settlements, even if you do consider that an invasion.\n\n&gt;After the assassination of Kurt Eisner, the Bolsheviks sent Adolf Hitler in to infiltrate the German counter-revolutionaries and create a stalking horse for the communist take over of Europe and the Zionist take over of Palestine.\n\nHitler: Lenin 2.0.\n\nBut seriously though, why would the Bolsheviks want a violently anti-Communist ideology in Germany? And how will that help with a Communist takeover? Are they already planning for after Germany attacks you? Did they think Germany wouldn't attack the Allies? Why did they accept the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact?\n\n&gt;Where did the mystical figure 6 million come from? It came from the Bible, in the book of *Leviticus* which states, \"you shall return\" with the cryptic numerical message interpreted by Jewish scholars of the Hebrew gematria to mean \"you shall return minus 6--million\" kind of like 6 iotas of difference.\n\nThis is where this gets extremely interesting, and where it stops being just another rambling idiot. For once, CJB has actually done a bit of research. But first:\n\n&gt;Jewry has engaged in a tremendous censorship campaign and has been waging war on the public's right to know for 73 years. The mass media constantly harp on the harm done to Jews in the Holocaust, but never discuss the more than one hundred million victims of Bolshevik genocide, nor the fact that Jews organized and orchestrated the Armenian Genocide. Obviously, they seek to portray Jewry as if innocent victims who have never done harm to anyone.\n\nI wonder why the media never discusses the Jewish conspiracy to genocide Armenians. Maybe because it never happened?\n\nAnyway, here's the interesting part:\n\n&gt;More on all that later, for now, let's directly address the divine number 6,000,000. Rabbi Benjamin Blech wrote in his book *The Secrets of Hebrew Words*:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"These are the words chosen to be inscribed on the Liberty Bell. It is in the Jubilee year that 'ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family.'The Hebrew word for 'ye shall return,' (TaShuVU), seems to be spelled incorrectly. Grammatically it requires another (vav). It ought to read (TaShUVU).Why is it lacking the letter (vav), which stands for 6? (TaShuVU) (without the 'vav') is a prediction to the Jewish people of ultimate return to their national homeland. (TaShuVU) in numbers adds up to 708: (tav) = 400,(shin) = 300, (vet) = 2, (vav) = 6). When we write the year, we ignore the millennia. In 1948 on the secular calendar, we witnessed the miracle of Jewish return to Israel. On the Hebrew calendar it was the year 5708. That was the year predicted by the incomplete word (TaShuVU), you shall return. We did return, lacking 6--an all-important 6 million of our people who perished during the Holocaust.Yet the fulfillment of the prediction of return in precisely that year implied by the gematria of (TaShuVU) gives us firm hope that the words of the Prophets for Final Redemption will come true as well.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ben Weintraub called attention to the fact that this exposition on the significance of the phrase \"you shall return\" explained why the Jews insist that six million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust, not one more, not one less, in his book *The Holocaust Dogma Of Judaism*. The gematria of the Hebrew phrase \"ye shall return\" is supposedly deliberately misspelled to indicate that the Jews would return to Palestine minus 6 million Jews in the year 1948.\n\nOK, this part is going to be long.\n\nThere's a long Jewish history of interpreting the Bible via something called \"Gematria\", which is basically assigning each letter a number. It can be very complicated though; it goes far, far deeper, to alternate ways of matching letters to numbers, adding digits, and much more. However, that's not relevant right now. What's relevant is how this is used.\n\nIn The Ethics of the Fathers, Torah learning is divided into two parts; meat and spices. Meat is the p'shat (literal interpretation), laws, philosophy, etc.; AKA, what actually matters. The spices are still Torah learning, but they're not essential. Gematria is in the \"spice\" category. Gematria cannot be used for deciding law, or even philosphical aspects. This is an INSANE oversimplification of an extremely complicated issue, but it's enough to get the point across; Gematria isn't used for deciding anything. It would certainly not be used to allow Jews to kill a third of their entire population. Unless the Jews have been planning this whole thing for over two thousand years and hinted at their ideas when the Bible was written.\n\nAnd that's not even the only problem.\n\nThe Amazon description of the book he quoted, The Secrets of Hebrew Words, starts with this:\n\n&gt;Ever since the earliest times, Jewish scholars have looked to the Hebrew language as a source of holiness and a wellspring of wisdom. Both letters and words, it has always been assumed, they have hidden messages and secrets to be sought after, as if we are opening a shell to extract the fruit.\n\nThis explicitly says that reason for finding gematrias is \"hidden messages and secrets\". Many Jews believe that all of history is hidden in the Torah this way. These interpretations are not what the Jews have planned , they're hints of the future that God hid in the Torah when he wrote it. THAT is what these are; finding hints to the then-future that God hid in the Torah. THEY ARE NOT ABOUT WHAT THE JEWS HAVE SECRETLY BEEN PLANNING.\n\nAnyway, this actually intrigued me. Clearly, CJB has actually done some research. This is no normal Holocaust denial, this is an detailed conspiracy complete with hints hidden in the Bible. But it's still completely wack.\n\nBack to the blog post.\n\n&gt;So now that we know why the number six million was chosen, we have the right and the obligation to ask when it was chosen. Don Heddesheimer's book *The First Holocaust: Jewish Fund Raising Campaigns with Holocaust Claims During and After World War I* and *Six Million Open Gates* by S.A.R. Lynch demonstrate that Jewry were claiming that 6 million Jews were about to be exterminated in Eastern Europe at least as early as 1900, long before Adolf Hitler came to power, but not long after Theodor Herzl published the Zionist treatise *The Jewish State* in 1896 calling for the Jews to return to Palestine. For this to happen, according to prophecy, six million Jews had to perish.\n\nI looked at both of these books. For the first one, I found a summary of the book [here](https://archive.org/details/TheFirstHolocaust-JewishFundRaisingCampaignsWithHolocaustClaimsDuringAndAfterWorldWarOne). I'm not quoting and tearing apart the whole review, I'm just going to mention that the only time it gives an example is here:\n\n&gt;\"Six million Jews in Poland and Russia threatened with imminent holocaust\": this allegation was appearing in such sources as *The New York Times* — but the year was 1919!\n\nAs I said earlier, this six million figure refers to the roughly 6 million Jews living in Eastern Europe at the time.\n\nThe second book, I found in full [here](https://archive.org/details/SIXMILLIONOPENGATESByS.A.R.Lynch271). I didn't read any of it, but I found [a list of times that 6,000,000 was mentioned before the Nuremberg Trials](http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php) which claims to take from the book. All of the ones I looked at are referring to the six million Jews in Eastern Europe (such as *\"In the midst of our campaign for the relief of the six million Jews of Eastern Europe\"* in  The Evening Tribune Providence in 1919), are actually talking about the Holocaust but before the Nuremberg Trials (like *\"some 6,000,000 men, women, and children - were put to death by the Nazis and their satellites\"* in The Times in 1945), don't have enough context to tell anything (such as *\"six million human beings, without food, shelter, clothing or medical treatment\"* from the New York Times in 1920), or just have absolutely nothing to do with the Holocaust at all (such as *\"From 1800 to 1902 he caused 6,000,000 Jewish families to be expelled from Russia\"* in the New York Times in 1905). My favorite was **\"And this was no disciplined march; it was a stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.\"** If you didn't recognize that quote, it's from WAR OF THE WORLDS BY H G WELLS. WHAT THE F\\*\\*K. WHAT DOES WAR OF THE WORLDS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE HOLOCAUST.\n\n&gt;The Jews not only repeatedly stated that 6 million Jews were about to be exterminated in the period from 1900 to 1922, they believed this was a necessary step towards the conquest of Palestine from the Arabs and the ingathering of the Jews in Palestine. Now, they would have us believe that it was just a mere coincidence that shortly after they predicted 6 million Jews would die in Eastern Europe while holding to the prophecy that the Jews would only return minus 6 million,\n\nWait for it...\n\n&gt;a Bolshevik blow-hard named Adolf Hitler rose from nowhere to rule Germany after infiltrating the counter-revolutionary DAP shortly after the assassination of Hitler's hero the Bolshevik Jew Kurt Eisner.\n\nWTF. Hitler was apparently a Bolshevik blow-hard. This takes \"left-wing Nazism\" to its extreme.\n\n&gt;Hitler, supposedly coincidentally, provided the Zionists with the pogrom they were openly predicting. Not only that, but he supposedly gave them the 6,000,000 corpse tally they needed for their god's green light to genocide the Palestinians and take their country. And just coincidentally, the Jews took Palestine right after Hitler did his deeds.\n\n~~Just going to put the fact that there was no genocide of Palestinians. Oppression, maybe, but no genocide. That is not political, just a fact.~~ EDIT: Never mind, everything's political.\n\n&gt;And not only that, but they have made it illegal in many countries to question the mystical figure six million with scientific facts, and have censored every voice telling the truth about discrepancies in the figures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What are the Jews hiding?\n\nOK, it's finally over.\n\nWell, that was longer then I thought it would be. And it was somehow worse than everything in the first one. And this was just one post on his blog. Maybe I'll make more posts on more of his blog, but for now, that's enough for me.\n\nBibliography:\n\n[The post](http://jewishracism.blogspot.com/2018/08/in-print-warnings-to-jews-premonitions.html)\n\n[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/stephen-s-wise-18741949](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/stephen-s-wise-18741949)\n\n[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nordau-max](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nordau-max)\n\n[http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php](http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php)",

        "text": "So I was checking out [this TIL thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/9cu3y6/til_the_historical_inaccuracies_in_the_movie_u571/) about the movie [U-571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-571_(film)) when I stumbled across [this comment](https://imgur.com/gallery/CP4kG4u) claiming that:\n\n&gt; Nazi Bon Jovi and his morale boosting war ballads could have turned the tide [of WWII]!\n\nNow, this obviously raises the question: *could* Bon Jovi have won the war for the Nazis? A question not many scholars have tackled, but a valid one nonetheless. I will do my best to avoid alternate history, but I will evaluate Jon Bon Jovi's utility to the Nazi war machine.\n\nFirst thing's first: could Germany have won if Bon Jovi had boosted their morale? While I cannot answer this definitively, I can rank this claim as unlikely, as the main problem facing Germany wasn't low morale (although this did kick in later in the war) but a lack of resources, as exemplified in the Reich's insistence on [capturing oil fields in Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcU6QYsOnFw&amp;list=PL3H6z037pboEcDk1Nvu6uQK9_oYtv1hJx&amp;index=4).\n\nSecondly, another issue arises with Bon Jovi's loyalties. This comment supposes that Bon Jovi would have been a Nazi, but there are several pieces of evidence that point to the contrary. First of all, Bon Jovi has been confirmed to be [a very religious man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDK9QqIzhwk), which wouldn't jive well with the Nazi's - at times - anti-religious bent.\n\nAnother problem exists with his name. Bon Jovi's real name is [John Francis Bongiovi Jr.](https://www.google.ca/search?q=bon+jovi+real+name&amp;oq=bon+jovi+real+name&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.3862j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), with his last name clearly being of Italian descent, meaning if anything he would have sided with Mussolini, and not Hitler. Mussolini was also known to be far friendlier with Christians within Italy, making it more likely that Bon Jovi would have sided with the other corner of the Axis.\n\nThis is all assuming that he Bon Jovi is a fascist however. While I don't know for certain, his political leanings can be found in his work. Specifically, Bon Jovi's first song, [R2-D2 We Wish You A Merry Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUFZklIOFvg), recorded for the Star Wars Christmas album, *Christmas in the Stars*. This shows that Bon Jovi is at least a supporter of astromech droid R2-D2, who was an integral aid in the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Thus, it can be extrapolated that Bon Jovi is a supporter of the Rebellion, and would be opposed to the Empire, who were shown to be fascist on several occasions; such as their use of Stormtroopers, their annihilation tactics against undefended star systems, their homogeneous upper echelons, and their Wunderwaffen programs which yielded such inefficient weapons as the Death Star (Mach I and Mach II).\n\nFinally, it is unlikely that Bon Jovi could have turned the tide for the Nazis as [he was born in 1962](https://www.google.ca/search?q=bon+jovi+age&amp;oq=bon+jovi+age&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2646j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), which is seventeen years after the end of the WWII.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBibliography:\n\n*Livin' On a Prayer*, Bon Jovi, 1986\n\n*R2-D2 We Wish You A Merry Christmas*, Anthony Daniels, 1980\n\n*WWII in HD Colour Part 4: Hitler Strikes East*, NM Productions, 2008\n\n*Fascism: A Very Short Introduction*, Kevin Passmore, 2014\n\n*Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope*, George Lucas, 1977\n\n*Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back*, Irvin Kershner, 1980\n\n*Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*, 1983\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "While browsing the Amazon Kindle store, I came across a book titled \"The Jewish Genocide of Armenian Christians\" by Christopher Jon Bjerknes. I looked at it, and...\n\nOh God. It's somehow worse than I thought from the title.\n\nFull disclosure right here; I haven't actually read the book, since I didn't want to pay five dollars (or thirty for the print version) to this idiot. I didn't get any of his other books either; if someone wants to and post it on this thread, go ahead. I'm basing this post off of the descriptions.\n\nSo, we'll begin our journey through Christopher Jon Bjerknes (hereon CJB) with the book that first caught my eye; \"The Jewish Genocide of Armenian Christians\". It's 620 pages and is rated 4.6/5 stars with seven reviews. I actually found a review and tear-apart of the whole book on [The Armenian Weekly](https://armenianweekly.com/2010/01/12/jacobs-the-outrageous-claim-of-christopher-jon-bjerkness-the-jewish-genocide-of-armenian-christians/), so if you're particularly interested in his conspiracies on the Armenian genocide, go read that. I'm going to primarily focus of CJB, not specifically this conspiracy. Now, let's dive into the book description. I'm just going to put the whole thing here and then tear it apart.\n\n&gt;In 1905, Jewish leaders calling themselves \"Young Turks\" met in Masonic lodges in Salonika, Italy, Paris and Vienna. They plotted a coup d'etat against the Sultan of Turkey Abdul Hamid II. Jews and crypto-Jewish Doenmeh of the Committee for Union and Progress took over complete control of the Turkish Empire in 1909. They had several goals. Their primary objective was to establish a segregated \"Jewish State\" in Palestine. They also sought to instigate World War I, to slaughter entire Christian populations, and to destroy the Turkish Empire and supplant Islamic religion and culture with a soulless and cultureless society engineered by Jewish positivists in Vienna, Paris, Italy and Salonika. This is their story.\n\nAlright. Now to destroy this.\n\n&gt;In 1905, Jewish leaders calling themselves \"Young Turks\"\n\nThe First Congress of Ottoman Opposition was in 1902. The Committee for Union and Progress was founded in 1906 as an umbrella organization, as was the Ottoman Freedom Society. The two unified in 1907. Nothing of importance happened in 1906.\n\nOh, and THEY WEREN'T JEWISH.\n\n&gt;met in Masonic lodges in Salonika, Italy, Paris and Vienna.\n\nItaly is not a city.\n\n&gt;They plotted a coup d'etat against the Sultan of Turkey Abdul Hamid II. Jews and crypto-Jewish Doenmeh of the Committee for Union and Progress took over complete control of the Turkish Empire in 1909.\n\nThe Young Turks threatened Abdul Hamid that they would revolt if he wouldn't bring back the Ottoman constitution which had been suspended in 1878. he didn't listen, and in 1908 (not 1909) they marched the Third Army (which had sided with them) to Istanbul. The Ottoman Emperor was forced to reinstate the constitution. The CUP slowly rose to power in the Chamber of Deputies (basically Congress/Parliament) in the years following that. They did not take control of the army.\n\nThe Dönmeh arose in the seventeenth century when the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi was forced by the Ottoman emperor to convert to Islam after he announced his intention to take the throne. Most of his followers abandoned him, but a small group followed him in conversion to Islam, using Kabbalistic reasons to justify it. There are anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that they were behind the Young Turks, but even those anti-Semitic conspiracies don't claim that world Jewry joined them. This is pure stupidity. Even ignoring the \"Duh\" reason, the religious Jews wouldn't have joined forces due to still having scars from Zevi, and the irreligious Jews of Europe wholeheartedly partook in discrimination against non-Europeans (they discriminated against non-Ashkenazi). This would decrease over the course of Zionism, but would only really end in 1979 with the Mizrahi rise to prominence in Israel under Begin.\n\n&gt;They had several goals. Their primary objective was to establish a segregated \"Jewish State\" in Palestine.\n\nOK, let's say this whole thing is true. The Jews now have total control over the Ottoman Empire. They can easily make an independent Jewish state. SO why didn't they? Well you see, they had \"several goals\". Well, what were these other goals so important that they needed to delay founding Israel for them?\n\n&gt;They also sought to instigate World War I, to slaughter entire Christian populations, and to destroy the Turkish Empire and supplant Islamic religion and culture with a soulless and cultureless society engineered by Jewish positivists in Vienna, Paris, Italy and Salonika.\n\nAlright, let's go through that slower.\n\n&gt;They also sought to instigate World War I,\n\nWhy would they want to instigate WW1? There is literally no reason for it.\n\n&gt;to slaughter entire Christian populations,\n\nThere were other Christian populations in the Ottoman Empire, especially before the Balkan Wars. Why would they just pick one to wipe out?\n\n&gt;and to destroy the Turkish Empire and supplant Islamic religion and culture with a soulless and cultureless society engineered by Jewish positivists in Vienna, Paris, Italy and Salonika.\n\nWoahwoahwoah, even total control over an empire doesn't mean you can REPLACE THE ENTIRE RELIGION OF EVERYONE THERE. Oh, and there is no Islamic culture. Turkic culture was the main one in the Ottoman Empire, but Arab culture was also very big.\n\nI'm assuming he's not referring to \"a philosophical theory stating that certain (\"positive\") knowledge is based on natural phenomena and their properties and relations\"-positivism, but \"laws are to be understood as social rules, valid because they are enacted by authority or derive logically from existing decisions, and that ideal or moral considerations should not limit the scope or operation of the law\"-positivism. I'm fairly certain that what he meant is that Jewish law has no exceptions, but that's not positivism. If that were, virtually all religions with rules would be positivist. Positivism is where you admit that putting the rule into practice is immoral, but do it anyway.\n\nOh, an Jewish culture exists. It's not \"cultureless\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that was a ride. After seeing this, I got morbidly curious and checked what other books CJB wrote. Hmm... Ah, here's one! \"E=mc^(2) and the JEWISH AGENDA\" (with those capitals). What's the description of this? Hmm...\n\n&gt;Referred to as \"the world's most famous equation,\" the mystic and cryptic formula E = mc2 has captured the imagination of young and old alike as revealing one of the universe's great secrets to man. It is a discovery which has elevated us above the animals to a height that approaches the lofty abode and celestial views of the gods. And like Prometheus' fire, it carries with it a curse and existential threat to life on Earth.\n\nThat actually doesn't sound that sinister. Let me check the single review on this book.\n\n&gt;Christopher jon Bjerknes' analysis of the centuries old Jewish plot to control the world and destroy ALL nonJews is brilliant.Listen to ALL his interviews on youtube...and read his blog.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!While Bjerknes is brilliant in his analysis of the destructive methods and Talmudic plans of the Jews, he seems to be placing too much faith in the Jews' atomic bomb narrative. Jews DO have horrific weapons...but those weapons are \"directed energy\" weapons --- the ones tested in the Gulf Wars being fought to make \"living space\" for a Greater Israel and tested on the Twin Towers in 2001..!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!The Manhattan Project that created \"atomic bombs\" has Jewish \"scriptwriting\" fingerprints all over it. This is NOT to say that the Jews do not have horrible weapons. They do. Just NOT the ones they advertised continuously in their books and movies from \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" to \"On the Beach\" to \"The China Syndrome.\" (The narrative continues with the hoaxed explosions at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear plants.) The really lethal weapons kill and maim SILENTLY. These weapons are the brain-melt weapons...directed energy weapons.These energy blasts can kill (and ARE killing) millions of goyim. These weapons imitate and create natural-seeming deaths from heart attacks and brain tumors.!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!Millions of people carry cellphones, which are de facto \"homing devices\" for these covert weapons of mass destruction. The weaponized cellphones were admitted (kabbalistically) in Jewlywood's 2015 movie, \"Kingsman.\"!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!The Manhattan Project most likely was a hoax. Why? First, all scientists involved in The Manhattan Project were Jews: Oppenheimer, Einstein, Teller, Szilard, Bethe, Lilienthal, and a young Richard Feynman, whose acting talents were later employed to give credibility to the Challenger disaster-hoax. Even Niels Bohr showed up at Los Alamos allegedly to give Oppenheimer the design of a German a-bomb design....to frighten the Pentagon goyim into believing the lie that Hitler was developing nukes.!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!According to Jennet Conant's book \"109 East Palace,\" the humble account centered on the life of Oppenheimer's secretary at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer spent most of his time building housing and finding potable water for his traveling troup of Jewish scientists and their families. In 1941 Los Alamos contained only a few ramshackle buildings located on a mountain in the desert -- far from reporters who could expose the bogus operation. The Manhattan Project did not start officially until 1943...and amazingly Oppenheimer had his bomb by 1945 -- this stretches credibility.!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!Why lie about a Big Bomb? The Lie of the Big Bomb was used to frighten the Pentagon Cold Warriors from invading Russia after WW II and Churchill's launch of the Cold War scenario. Stalin's alleged possession of atomic bomb secrets, allegedly passed to him by the Jewish spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whose alleged treason (as well as the alleged existence of atomic bombs) was advertised by the Rosenbergs' staged (or sacrificial) trial under the control of a Jewish judge.!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!Nukes were not used to bomb the wooden cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These cities were firebombed like the other Japanese cities. The lie about atomic bombs was supported by the Imperial Family and the Japanese bankers who had colluded with the Rothschilds to set up WW II. The collusion of the Japanese bankers with the Rothschilds went back to 1905, when Jacob Schiff, the Rothschilds' agent on Wall Street, loaned Japan the money to destroy Russia's fleet at Port Arthur....while Jacob Schiff's agent, Trotsky (Lev Bronstein) was attacking the Tsar in St Petersburg with his gang of 300 Russian-speaking Jews who had trained in New Jersey and had American passports.!&lt;\n\n...\n\nAlright, I'm not reviewing this whole comment. It would take way too long, it's way too obvious, and I don't think it was written by CJB. It does say that CJB has interviews on Youtube and a blog, so let's see those. But first, let me just mention that apparently this book claims that the Talmudic scholars knew about the atom bomb.\n\nBefore we move on, let me just mention that CJB also has books titled \"Einstein's Plagiarism of the General Theory of Relativity\", \"ALBERT EINSTEIN The Incorrigible RACIST\", \"Mileva Einstein-Marity - Einstein's Partner in Crime\" and \"SAMUEL TOLVER PRESTON: FATHER OF E = mc2, THE ATOMIC BOMB AND ATOMIC ENERGY\". So he's very anti-Einstein and pro-pseudoscience. He also has, weirdly enough, a book titled \"Putin's Reign of Terror: the Permanent Revolution in Our Time\" which, while still a conspiracy theory, breaks the mold a bit.\n\nAlright, let's see this idiot on Youtube.\n\nWait a second. ***Metapedia*** (the alternative encyclopedia; probably a conspiracy wiki) ***says he's Jewish?*** What the hell? He also has a blog called Jewish Racism. So he's a crazily anti-Semitic Jew. Sadly, not historically uncommon.\n\nOK, OK, back on track. Youtube.\n\nOK, here's one: [Einstein &amp; The Zionist Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqxSarq_UB0). It has 77 views and is three hours and forty-two minutes long. Never mind.\n\nAh, here we are; [an explanation of his conspiracies on the Armenian Genocide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A9BB0xAM0w). Let's see what he has to say.\n\nActually, I should probably first check where he's getting interviewed. The station is Republic Broadcasting Network, which is advertised as a \"truth radio station\". The interviewer is Mark Dankof, who has [a website](http://www.markdankof.com/). Let's see what his website has to say.\n\n&gt;Formerly the 36th District Chairman of the Republican Party in King County/Seattle and later an elected delegate to Texas State Republican Conventions in 1994 and 1996, he entered the United States Senate race in Delaware in 2000 as the nominated candidate of the Constitution Party against Democratic candidate Thomas Carper and Republican incumbent William Roth.\n\nHuh. District Chairman of the Republican Party in Seattle must be a tough job.\n\nThe subtitle of the website is \"**Dedicated to the American Constitution, the Old Republic, and Christian Orthodoxy**\". From the essays on his website, he seems to be an ultra-liberal ultra-Christian? Those exist?\n\nOh, and he's extremely anti-Semitic.\n\nI'm not going into depth on him here, since he's not the focus. Let's get back to CJB's interview.\n\nAlright, this is audio only with an image montage in the background. This montage includes his book on the Armenian genocide, a book called \"The Synagogue of Satan\", CJB talking about settlements in the West Bank, a Kabbalistic diagram with a snake on it, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and what looks like a meme someone made of CJB that he took seriously. Pretty good sign of what's to come.\n\n&gt;(about Armenians) They were very prominent in the Ottoman Turkish Empire. They were the administrators, the ministers, the bankers, the professionals, the academics; they constituted the intelligentsia of the Turkish Empire.\n\nWhat? The Armenians were solid second-class Dhimmi, like all other non-Muslims. They tried to break out in the 1860s and 1870s, and utterly failed, with the Ottoman government shoving them back down. This led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, which ended with a decisive Russian victory. The Russians tried to annex Armenia, but the UK objected. In the end, the Ottoman Empire was just required to pay lip service. Europe then forgot about it, as the Ottomans massacred Armenians in the 1894-1896 Hamidian Massacres. The Armenians never managed to break out of second- or third-class citizens, let alone become the Ottoman Intelligentsia.\n\nCJB now goes on to say that the Jews saw the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire as the only way to gain Palestine, so they cut a deal with treacherous Armenians that \"the Armenians would betray their people to a massacre\", which would enrage the West so much that they would invade, partition the Ottoman Empire, and divide the Ottoman Empire into states for the Armenians and Arabs, allowing the Jews to seize Palestine. Even if this was possible, it would be a stupid plan. The West had already abandoned Armenia in 1894, so why would it be different this time? Even if that worked, how could the Jews be sure they would be able to snatch Palestine?\n\nDankof asks:\n\n&gt;Do you essentially then see this as a situation where at the peace conference of 1903, certain things were being let out of the bag in terms of what the Zionist game plan was for both Armenia as well as for the Ottoman Empire - and for the world for that matter - with the ultimate game plan in mind of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, ultimately creating a world government that would have a Jewish Messiah at its head; keeping all of that in mind, when some of this came out - at least portions of it - in 1903. why was there not a more concerted attempt in your view on the part of world central governments that were being targeted by this sort of thing to attempt to weed out the subversion that was within its midst, or were there attempts that simply failed?\n\nHuh?\n\nFirstly, I can't find any \"peace conference of 1903\". Secondly, nobody mentioned the world. The whole conspiracy doesn't mention the world. Where are you getting this Jewish world government from?\n\nOh right, it's a crazy anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. There must be a Jewish world government.\n\nCJB goes on to say that this was a Zionist conference, so I presume the \"peace conference of 1903\" is the Sixth Zionist Congress, the one where the Uganda Plan was proposed. that has nothing to do with this.\n\nAnyway, the Salonika Jews who founded the Young Turks movement blamed the Christians of the Ottoman Empire for everything wrong, specifically the Armenian bankers for bankrupting the country. Of course, it was actually the Rothschilds who were bankrupting the country so that they could force the Sultan to sell them Palestine. However, this accidentally made the Sultan believe that the Christians were behind bankrupting the empire, so the Young Turks pitted the Sultan against the Christians by pretending to be victims of the Christians themselves (so this is also 1.5-thousand-years-of-Christian-anti-Semitism-denial). The Armenians fell for it because they though the massacre would allow them to finally gain a country through international sympathy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Czar realized what was going on and identified Zionism as the problem. The Czar had created an extremely tolerant empire (which is why the Jews had been ruthlessly persecuted there for over a hundred years), and noticed that Zionism was trying to take assimilating Jews and make them into a united nation opposed to the Czar. Therefore, the Czar outlawed Zionism, and was called intolerant for this.\n\nDankof now interrupts and asks why the Zionists continued once the Czar discovered their plot. CJB answers that the Jews chose that moment to launch an economic war against Russia, tutning the Russian people against the Czar. The caused poverty among the Russian population, instigated the Russo-Japanese War (which was started when Czar Nicholas II refused to withdraw from Manchuria. Was he in on this too?), funded Japan so that they would win (this part is actually semi-true. Jacob Schiff, a Jew who had fled from Russia and became wealthy in London, gave the Japanese $200 million for their war as revenge against the Czar.), flooded the Russians with Marxist propaganda, and inspired the failed revolution of 1905.\n\n&gt;An attempted revolution happened in 1905 and it's it's widely known that that Revolution was really another attempted Jewish takeover.\n\nI'm not even going to ask about that \"widely known\".\n\nAnyway, now it forgets that Armenia exists and becomes a game of \"Name the anti-Semitic conspiracy!\" The Federal Reserve, Trotsky, and-\n\n&gt;Trotsky pursued this idea of permanent revolution which has been handed down through the Trotskyites to the neoconservatives in America today where they have changed the language subtly to regime change. We find this process of permanent revolution still occurring through these Trotskyites. You had the same Trotsky infiltration of the CIA in the 1950s in the 1960s which led to the stabilization of the Middle East where they were overthrowing Mossadegh and blackmailing and bribing all the leaders of the Middle East.\n\nWait, that's not an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory!\n\nAnyway, this whole thing is set up to lead to a bunch of revolutions in the Middle East, whose primary benficiary will be the bankers; AKA the Jews. OK, this is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.\n\n&gt;The goals appear to be to kill off a lot of people to destroy national sovereignties to establish a world government and to establish Greater Israel. All these are the Messianic goals of Judaism and they see that these are in fact the goals that are being carried out by these people.\n\nWait, a world government *and* Greater Israel? As two separate things?\n\nAnyway, the Jews weren't interested in Zionism. They wanted to move to America or stay in Europe, not move to Israel. (Also, Bar Kokhba was apparently a Zionist.) The Zionists came up with a brilliant solution - Nazism!\n\nWait, what?\n\nWell, you see, when the Jews tried and failed to put a Bolshevik government in Bavaria, they decided that apparently the Germans don't like communism; they'll create an artificial anti-communist ideology to take over Germany. Hitler will persecute the Jews, and they'll come to Palestine.\n\n&gt;There was a boycott against Germany after Adolf Hitler took power and it was the Zionists who came to Hitler's defense and who helped to finance Nazism.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is talking about Arlosoroff, who negotiated with the Nazis for them sending the Jews to Israel but got assassinated for negotiating with the Nazis. Also, that boycott was one from the Zionists.\n\nThe video stops here, but I presume the actual interview went further and denied the Holocaust. This seems to be a set-up to that for me.\n\nBasically, this video is a rambling mess. Three minutes in to an eleven minute video, it forgets the topic and just spits out every anti-Semitic conspiracy theory it can think of.\n\nAlright, now let's check out his blog.\n\n&gt;Whether entirely guilty, partially responsible, or completely innocent, the rest of the world openly blamed the Jews for the Armenian Genocide which claimed 1.5 million lives, and for the Bolshevik mass murder of tens of millions. Adolf Hitler repeatedly stated that the reason why he attacked the Jews, was because he personally held them responsible for the Bolshevik slaughter of thirty million innocent human beings by 1923. Several concerned people made numerous attempts from 1911 through 1922 to warn the Jews that a massive pogrom awaited European Jewry as a consequence of their alleged, as well as proven, participation in Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These dire warnings had the exact opposite of the intended effect on world Jewry. Jewish leaders argued that the best means to prevent an extermination pogrom was to keep the philo-Semitic Bolsheviks in power, regardless of the crimes they were committing against humanity. In this way, the Bolshevists and the Jewish bankers who put them in power used their crimes against humanity as an excuse to remain in power, solicit aid from those they sought to subvert, and commit more such acts of genocide. Instead of heeding this cautionary advice and perhaps helping to prevent the Holocaust as well as sparing Eastern Europe and other regions of the world the future communist genocide of 100 million souls, organized Jewry opted to scapegoat Germany for the mass murder of Bolshevism and the Armenian Genocide, and vehemently denied the well established and extensive Jewish involvement in these inhuman atrocities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Jewish bankers used their crimes as an excuse to keep their murderous hordes in power in the Soviet Union. They indemnified the Bolsheviks with the very blood they had spilled, because they did not want their efforts to ruin Russia and Eastern Europe to be in vain. They basically stated that, \"You can not depose the Jews, because they have killed 30 million people and the nations will retaliate against the Jews for those atrocities. So in the name of humanity, you must keep the murdering Jews in power to murder more, lest they be murdered themselves.\" Of course, this was just a show for the public to justify Allied support for the Soviet Union, which was a foregone conclusion. The Jewish bankers had the power to keep the Bolsheviks they put in power, in power, because they controlled American President Woodrow Wilson through blackmail for his affair with Mrs. Peck, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George through his religious Zionist ties to Lord Rothschild, and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau through the puppetry of another Rothschild, Louis George Rothschild, a.k.a. Georges Mandel. Even if there were no threat of retaliation against the Jewish masses for the crimes of the Bolsheviks and bankers, they would have simply manufactured a different excuse to keep their regime in place.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rather than try to end Bolshevism, organized Jewry came to the aid of the failing Soviet Union they had created and sought to sustain. The Jews lobbied Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Lloyd George and Clemenceau to prevent the Allies from intervening on behalf of the Russian people against the Bolsheviks, and on the contrary instigated these leaders to rescue the crumbling Bolshevik Empire in the name of protecting 6 million Jews from pogroms, which these men then did by formally recognizing, trading with, and supplying massive aid to the collapsing Soviet Union. In this way, leading Jews used their genocidal crimes as a pretext to keep their criminal agents in power in Russia, sophistically arguing that it was necessary for the Bolsheviks to remain in power in order to prevent any retaliation against Jews for those same crimes, while ignoring the peril they themselves posed to hundred of millions of non-Jewish lives, and covering up their own guilt for already having mass murdered tens of millions of Russians. They then proceeded to amplify their murderous campaign and open threats to take over the world and had the American people paying for it, all in the name of protecting the Jews, but in complete disregard for Russian life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This ultimately resulted in World War Two, the Holocaust, the Communist extermination of one hundred million more human beings, the spread of Communism to all of Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and Cambodia, and in the Cold War which threatened to end all human life. As many had predicted by 1920, the day of reckoning for allegedly brutally murdering several tens of millions of helpless innocents was not far off for Eastern European Jewry, as was the Bolshevik genocide of 100,000,000 more defenseless men, women, children and infants as genocidal Marxism spread its wings and dragged its claws around the globe.\n\nWell then. That's a handful. And that's the extremely abbreviated version; I cut out about three-quarters of it. It goes a lot longer.\n\nThis post is already getting REALLY long, so I'm going to save this blog post, and maybe a few others, for a sequel in a few days.\n\nEDIT: By mod request, bibliography:\n\n\"The Jewish Genocide of Armenian Christians\" Amazon summary\n\n\"E=mc2 and the JEWISH AGENDA\" Amazon review\n\n[http://www.markdankof.com/](http://www.markdankof.com/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A9BB0xAM0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A9BB0xAM0w)\n\n[http://jewishracism.blogspot.com/2018/08/in-print-warnings-to-jews-premonitions.html](http://jewishracism.blogspot.com/2018/08/in-print-warnings-to-jews-premonitions.html)\n\nSo yeah, that's Christopher Jon Bjerknes, part one.

        "text": "Everyone knows the story of the USS William D Porter. How she forgot to weigh anchor and wrecked a sister ship, then had a series of hilarious mishaps that ended with her accidently firing a torpedo at the USS Iowa and almost torpedoing FDR's hopes of getting to the Yalta Conference, then rearranging someone's flowerbed in the Aleutians before dying to a kamikaze that sunk.\n\nThis story first came to light in The Retired Officer's Magazine in 1994, and has been circulating first in the US Navy, then online. Congratulations, most of the stuff you heard of is BAD HISTORY.\n\nLet's check the facts with the War Diary of the Willie D.\n\nFACT: Willie D was moored between the USS Cogswell and USS Young during her training runs. There was no mention in the Porter's War Diary, or in Cogswell's and Young's ship diaries. (William D Porter's War Diary, 1-12 November, 1943)\n\nFACT: No depth charges were recorded falling overboard in the log books of the task force's ships.\n\nFACT: Porter's Boiler #3 failed due to its tubes and the ship had to slow down to repair it. There is also a cancelled report regarding a lost ship rating. I believe this is where the story of the flooding boiler room started from. Cancellation implies they found the rating. (William D Porter's War Diary, 13 November, 1943)\n\nFACT: The Porter did fire a live torpedo at the USS Iowa by accident. The guilty torpedoman was charged. (William D Porter's War Diary, 14 November, 1943)\n\nNOTABLE MENTION: The investigation was done at sea.\n\nFACT: The crew of the Porter was not arrested in Bermuda. (William D Porter's War Diary, 14 November, 1943)\n\nFACT: The commander of the ship was NOT arrested for this. The only arrest made was of the offending torpedoman on duty, and even FDR commuted his sentence.\n\nFACT: Nope, the Porter did not have an accidental discharge of her gun at the base commander's house. No mention of it was in the war diary. (William D Porter's War Diary, Dec 1943)\n\nNOTABLE MENTION: Willie D conducted shore bombardment exercises from 12 January to 14 January in the Aleutians. And again on the 30th of January, around the waters of Pearl Harbor. Shore bombardment exercises are NOT equivalent to accidentally shelling the base commander's flower garden.\n\nFACT: The Porter did not shoot down any US warplanes OR the USS Luce. There is no mention of those incidents in the Porter's war diaries. The USS Luce was sunk on May 4, 1945, way before the event supposedly happened. Also, you'd think the Luce's logs would mention that. Also, Porter earned four battle stars in Okinawa, just before a kamikaze sunk her.\n\nThis has been an object lesson to never take anything on the Internet face value, and that ~~Japan~~ China and some crazy Americans totally has the [right](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warship-girls/images/f/f2/William_D._Porter.png/revision/latest?cb=20150727012826) [idea](http://i.imgur.com/HzsORNx.png) [turning](http://i.imgur.com/ovTX6iE.png) [ships](http://i.imgur.com/gw0uavp.png) into girls.

        "text": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uetzIcikf4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uetzIcikf4k)\n\n\\[Video in question. The titles below are paraphrased from his arguments and if you believe they don't represent his points in the proper context please feel free to let me know.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould people feel guilty for the past?\n\nI recently watched a video by ‘’Scholagladiatoria’ who made his case for why we, citizens of the United Kingdom, should not feel guilt for the sins of previous generations, whether that be the colonisation of Africa or the subjugation of the Indian sub-continent. Matt Easton’s channel is dedicated mostly to videos featuring swords and various forms of martial arts. He is an expert in this field and is quite rightly respected for his opinion on these topics. I thoroughly enjoy watching his videos, however his recent video titled “Apologising for Empire, or ‘The Sins of the Parent are not the Sins of the Child” rankled me, and a felt compelled to respond in kind. I would like to preface this response by unequivocally stating that I believe that Easton is doing fantastic work, but however much we may admire someone it is important to challenge them when you believe they have gotten it wrong. I wholeheartedly disagree with his views on this issue.\n\nI should preface this by stating that at the beginning of the video, he makes a very good point that I believe should be reiterated more often on these types of channels. While we are rightly interested and fascinated with military history and its various implements of war, it is important to remember that these items, or machines are representative of the ugliest periods in our history. It is far too easy to detach ourselves from the past. Ironically, after this salient point, Easton then spends the next ten minutes arguing that we should in some way, detach ourselves from our history.\n\nEaston begins his argument by stating that “in 2018” in both developing and developed countries, there is an incredible amount of inherited guilt, and that grudges between nations and peoples persevere. He explains that he feels strongly about this topic because a lot of his videos relate to the British imperial period. Fair enough. He argues further that he is not an apologist but accepts that bad things that happened in the past are bad, and that in some form there is a general morality we can all recognise and therefore point to the wrongs of the past and state confidently that they are wrong. I couldn’t agree more with him on this point, it is important to recognise that while a lot can be said for the relativity of morality, in the context of this argument we must accept that bad things happened. Where we begin to disagree therefore is the matter of guilt, but I will address that a little later.\n\nTo contextualise his argument,  Easton portrays it within a modern framing, the war in Afghanistan. He argues that we as British subjects are not guilty of the Afghan war. We are not guilty because we did not make the decision. As subjects were may only vote, lobby or protest. Accordingly, he claims that these forms of expression are limited and generally do not achieve much. This is a very convenient absolution of guilt. We *are* responsible for the decisions our government as it acts in a representative capacity of us. We live in a democracy and have our say by electing MPs that correspond with our values. No, we did not pull the trigger, but we did elect the trigger-puller. We could argue about the various benefits and drawbacks of such a form of representation, but we do not live under authoritarian rule where we are not entitled to have our say. Have our voices been marginalised at times? Of course. Have decisions been made against the public will? Certainly. But that is an essential drawback of democracy, we may disagree with the actions that have been taken, but as a whole we share responsibility for what is done in our name. We cannot cherry pick the good and brush away the bad because we don’t agree with it. It is also quite sad that Easton has such a low opinion on his ability to enact change. It is this feeling of apathy or learned helplessness that enables politicians to believe they can do as they wish. Voting matters and we should never promote the idea that it doesn’t because then we invite apathy or worse into the mix.\n\nEaston continues his argument framing it within an historical context, claiming that because we are not responsible for what our government does *now*, naturally we cannot be expected to feel guilty for what previous governments did in the *past.* The two situations are not comparable. Fundamentally we disagree on the fact that we *can* enact change today. True, we cannot change what happened in the past, but the fact of the matter is that every day we live within the aftermath of those decisions. Are we responsible for those decisions? No of course not. He further argues that his ancestors likely had even less say than he does now in government and are likewise absolved of guilt. And even if they had had been pro-empire in the era of Gladstone, he has inherited their genes only and not their sins. I agree that we cannot hold someone today accountable for what say, what their great-grandfather did, but this consideration does not extend to *government and nation* where there is a continuity of identity and legacy.\n\nI am not arguing for anyone to feel personal guilt for what happened before, but we must accept that what happened severely affected our present and that while we may not have participated in the ‘race for Africa’ or the subjugation of India we still benefit from it today, evident in the comparative quality of life between the former master and the former subject. It is this benefit that we must be aware of. Any historian worth their salt must be aware of their own conscious and unconscious bias and learn to control it. As the historian understands his bias, citizens too must understand their history and why things are as they are. We must acknowledge our troubled history and understand it for what it is, how it affects us now and how we can implement change to atone for it and prevent it happening again. We hear so little bad about the empire here in the United Kingdom, it is taught in schools as something that is just a matter-of-fact. Easton notes that he does not hold Germans or Austrians responsible for the Second World War. And I agree wholeheartedly, most Germans alive today had not part in it. However, what is admirable about Germany today, is that they feel a *national guilt* for what happened previously, and unabashedly approach their history with the revulsion it deserves. British history is much different, and there is very little emphasis on the true horrors of colonialism. \n\nEaston further states that grudges still exist around the world over things that happened 50, 100 or even 500 years ago. Yes! And why shouldn’t they? I believe he is clearly demonstrating his bias in this regard, or rather belying his upbringing. Being English in today’s world is rather inoffensive. Apart from the Second World War, or the Falklands there hasn’t been much to complain about and therefore it is easy to belittle those who you deem have irrational grudges. But for other parts of the world, the ramifications of events fifty, one hundred or even five hundred years ago are still deafening. Historical events do not happen within a vacuum, and it is ludicrous to assume that people should be more disconnected with the past. Should Irish people feel no animosity towards the British after centuries of persecution and colonial rule? Should black Americans feel no grievance for the enslavement of their ancestors or their persecution and disenfranchisement after emancipation? Should Indians feel no anger towards their ancestor’s exploitation at the hands of the British? You *could* argue no that they themselves were not those being enslaved or persecuted, but no one begins life as a clean slate. India is still recovering for the legacy of colonial rule, a fact that Shashi Tharoor clearly presents in his book *Inglorious Empire* that I would advise you to read. India’s wealth was extracted, and her development hindered by the shackles placed by our ancestors. We did not place those shackles, but we still enjoy the benefits they brought. In Ireland, we still suffer from the decisions made people long gone, the plantation of the island, the persecution of Irish identity and the partition. Black Americans today, while never slaves themselves, still suffer from the very real ramifications of a post-slave society. They are more likely to live below the poverty line, in predominantly poorer areas. This isn’t by accident. The history of their ancestors affects everything, from the area they inhabit, their education levels and their economic background. Africa and the Middle East still suffer from the post-colonial fallout that has destabilised many of these regions ever since.\n\n*· There are grudges still around, all over the world over things that happened 50, 100 or 500 years ago.*\n\nAnother point that I can’t appreciate as to why he made it, is that grudges are kept alive, fifty, one hundred or even five hundred years after whatever event that caused them. By why shouldn’t they? No person is born in isolation. What happened to their region or group massively affects their circumstances, their views and their identity. Some of these grudges have even become intertwined with a person’s sense of identity, and nationality. I don’t understand how he expects grudges not to transcend generations. Each generation itself does not exist in a vacuum and there is considerable overlap that will always pass on the culture of the previous generation. I could address this point further, but I don’t see the point in doing so when the issue is so self-evident.\n\n*· Political decisions of the past create ripples and ramifications for people in the future but we can’t hold people today accountable for those actions.*\n\nWe cannot hold anyone today responsible for what was done in the past. That is true. You can’t incriminate someone for what their father did. I don’t dispute that. That does not mean they are without responsibility in how they acknowledge the ramifications of those actions. Furthermore, governments and nations are a little different from individuals. Most governments are continuations of those previous institutions, and there must be some accountability. Otherwise, should we never hold any institution accountable? The people have changed but the institution remains. If a company were to commit massive fraud, is it forgiven because they change their CEO yet continue to reap the benefits of breaking the rules? If that doesn’t work for companies, why should it work for say, the British Government? Yes, no one within the current government oversaw British India etc. but the institution is largely the same, and the institution reaped the rewards. Those who participate continue to reap those rewards, and while they are not personally to blame, they do partake in its legacy and therefore should not be open to the benefits whilst being shielded from the blame. If you murder your neighbour and take his possessions, would anyone blame his son for holding a grudge against you? Would anyone feel he is unjust in petitioning your son for his rightful possessions after you have passed? They did not commit the crime, they are not criminals, but they still benefitted for it, and should graciously hope to make some form of amends.\n\n*· Your government today is making bad decisions, should you be blamed for what is going on now?*\n\nYes! Our government is representative of us, and it is up to us to hold it accountable and make our voices heard when it commits injustices. This isn’t always done and is hard to enact. However, we are all in some way responsible for it. Yes, we might not have any discernible individual power, but to say that we shouldn’t be blamed for what is done in our name is just a cop out. Voting and protesting are civic duties, and to simply wash our hands of it and claim “it wasn’t me that made the decision” just reeks of a lazy attempt at justifying inaction.\n\n*· Ask yourself before you make value judgements, is that nation hurting me now? Are they a threat?*\n\nI understand the point you are trying to make. For instance, in Ireland there has always been a grudge with the English due to a millennium of shared history. Are the English a threat now? No, but they are still feeling the ramifications of that history and it does not go away easily. And while I feel it is silly to hold onto certain grudges, like that between England and France for example, you’d be hard pressed to find many people that seriously subscribe to it. In some areas of the world it is a lot more serious than that and is usually due to some very real problems.\n\n*· If we didn’t do all of these horrible things, someone else would have.*\n\nThis point is just bad. Let’s take the previous scenario, in what world would anyone make the defending argument “if I didn’t break into his house, murder him and steal all his stuff someone else would have?” You would be quite rightly, laughed out of the court house. And even if that is true, and there were a hundred other people waiting in the murder and pillage line behind you, it doesn’t in any way justify your actions. Why should the actions of institutions be any different? And so, what if someone else would have done it? The only difference would have been that they would have reaped the rewards and not you. Do you really believe that is makes any other difference to this argument? For the average Indian in the 1920s would he have cared whether he was being persecuted by the French Raj instead of that of the British? And had that been the case, the French would have to share in that responsibility today, for they would have either directly or indirectly benefited from the rewards of the wholesale subjugation of the Indian people. This line of reasoning also removes any form of agency from those involved, they are simply actors on a stage performing the role assigned to them. It also makes the supposition of inevitability, a cardinal sin in this profession.\n\nSo, what is the alternative? I am a great admirer of the post-war German approach, where there is full acknowledgement of the horror of their past. They have made a concerted effort to preserve that history and ensure that it is taught to future generations whilst attempting to establish ways in which to discourage it from happening again. The problem we have in the UK however, is that we are not so keen to portray our history as accurately as is proper. The empire is looked back upon fondly, its brutality has largely been whitewashed. It is akin the Japanese government refusing to acknowledge the full extent of their war crimes during the Sino-Japanese war. What I am proposing is encouraging people to look at their past objectively, unreservedly and to draw their conclusions honestly. I’m not making the argument for reparations, that is one way of atonement, but I think we should go further. I am not asking for anyone here in the UK to wake up each morning and feel guilt for what was done in the past, but we must educate ourselves and appreciate the factors that led us here and hope to preserve its legacy and learn from it. That should be our goal at the very least, to no longer remain ignorant of our past, and where possible, to make amends in any little way we can.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/98zwu5/bring_me_the_head_of_yukio_mishimas_badhistory/",
        "text": "Yukio Mishima seems to be building a cult on youtube. A few years ago and nobody seemed to have heard of him, but slowly on youtube you can see more and more videos about him pop up (with even [Pewdiepie making a video about him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b037fgPG9Ow), because of course Pewdiepie is a fan of Mishima)\n\nMost of these videos are either simplistic biopics or fawning proto-fascist propaganda. [The video I'll be talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPVQmLWdfcE) belongs in the former category (thank Christ)\n\nThe video is by Simple History, an animated youtube channel that deals in - you guessed it - simple history. Obviously their name suggests that they're not trying to be intricately, academically detailed, but who gives a shit, this is r/badhistory - Nitpickers Anonymous.\n\nBefore the video even begins the first piece of badhistory is in the title - The Actor who staged a Coup and committed Seppuku. This is *technically* true, but if you asked anyone who Yukio Mishima was, 99.9% of the time their response would be \"writer\", not actor. He did act, but it was secondary to his writing career.\n\nAt 0:29, the narrator claims that Mishima didn't join the Imperial Japanese Army after \"having been deemed unfit for military service, due to tuberculosis.\" Mishima actually [had a cold, which he claimed was tuberculosis so as to dodge service](https://youtu.be/Ctufj50w9a0?t=747). \n\nAt 0:36 the narrator points out that Mishima's \"first novel, *Thieves*, [is] about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide\". This is correct, but I couldn't help but notice the wording of that sentence is almost identical to [the description of *Thieves* on Yukio Mishima's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima#Post-war_literature), which says that the novel is \"a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide.\" It's not badhistory, just blatant plagiarism.\n\nAt 1:00, the narrator points out that Mishima had written \"several plays\". This is an egregious nitpick, but I would not call writing an average of between two and three plays a year for twenty years writing \"several\" plays - according to Hiroaki Sato in *My Friend Hitler: And Other Plays*. Although this miswording is understandable - after all, [Yukio Mishima's Wikipedia page only lists eleven plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima#Plays_for_classical_Japanese_theatre).\n\nAt 1:43, the narrator claims Mishima \"wanted Japan to return to how it had been in pre-war times, with strong patriotism and tradition such as Bushido, the code of the Samurai.\" First of all, the narrator pronounces it as \"Bushi**ro**\", and I don't know how you can flub that. Secondly, Mishima didn't want Japan to return to Bushido, or at least not the way they had previously been pursuing it. In *On Hagakure*, Mishima re-interprets Bushido as a personal existential-ish philosophy (albeit one still based in nationalism), rather than a strict code of honour. While the old Hagakure and Bushido code was used by the Empire of Japan to justify kamikaze attacks, Mishima re-interprets the central conceit - that it is better to choose death when confronted with a life/death situation - as an act of existential rebellion, wherein an individual is in complete control of their existence by dictating when to end it. Again, nitpicky, but Mishima's take was more nuanced than 'wanting to go back to the way things were'.\n\nAt 4:50, after detailing Mishima's (in)famous suicide, the narrator claims that many members of the public thought Mishima's death was a hoax \"and had finally won the Nobel Peace Prize.\" Now, for all we know Yukio Mishima could have been nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it's far more likely the narrator meant to say that many people thought he had finally won the Nobel Prize *in Literature*, which [he was in the running for](https://youtu.be/Ctufj50w9a0?t=1090) until it was awarded to his [friend and mentor Yasunari Kawabata in 1968](https://youtu.be/Ctufj50w9a0?t=1125). I would overlook something like this, but the narrator repeats the mistake several times afterwards, and it's indicative of lazy production and editing more than anything.\n\nAt 5:18, during the wrap-up, the narrator says that Mishima had \"always been obsessed with death all his life and many of his works centered on suicide, in particular by seppuku.\" Poor writing aside, I don't where else this fact could have been pulled except from directly out of the writer's ass. While it is true that Mishima had always been obsessed with death, to say many of his works centered on suicide, seppuku in particular, is an overstatement. Death and existence are a recurring theme in his works, but suicide is less common, and seppuku even less so - only really appearing in the latter three books of his *Sea of Fertility* tetralogy. They were far from nonexistent, even noticeable, but they weren't an ever-present theme.\n\nAll-in-all, this isn't the worst case of badhistory on youtube, but it irks me that Yukio Mishima, a major and complicated figure in modern Japanese literature, is often just seen as \"that alpha badass chad that launched a coup and commit sudoku\". Also whenever a video of this type is posted some of the most obnoxious comments imaginable appear (\"The world needs japan to save the day\" and \"Mishima was a hero, the last Japanese man with intact testicles\" are two unfortunately representative examples) and the quality control for a channel of this size (over 1 million subscribers) is so shockingly substandard that I felt the need to complain.\n\nReally Simple History? Plagiarizing a Wikipedia article?\n\nEdit: cleared up some language\n\nEdit 2:\n\nHere's the bibliography:\n\n*The Strange Case of Yukio Mishima*, BBC, 1985\n\n*My Friend Hitler: And Other Plays*, Yukio Mishima (trans: Hiroaki Sato), 2002\n\n*Hagakure: Samurai Ethic and Modern Japan*, Yukio Mishima, 1979",

        "title": "A quick look at how the flight of ethnic Serbs from Croatia during Operation Storm was not exactly a voluntary affair",
        "author": "crnaruka",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/98q41s/a_quick_look_at_how_the_flight_of_ethnic_serbs/",
        "text": "Recently Croatia marked the 23rd anniversary of [Operation Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm). This was one of the largest military operations of the Yugoslav Wars and it resulted in the capture of a wide swath of territory from Serb forces that had been ruled as the breakaway [Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina). The operation also resulted in the departure of about 200,000 ethnic Serbs from the region. This last major detail is one of the most contentious aspects of the Yugoslav wars and a longstanding source of tension between Serbia and Croatia. On a recent thread about the anniversary of the operation I saw the following comment:\n&gt;The idea that these people were ethnically cleansed is a pure lie. Nobody forced the Serbs to leave, they did so voluntarily because their own leaders told them to do so. Look at the decision of the international tribunal that dismissed this Serbian propaganda. \n\nVarious forms of the statement above came up both in discussions on reddit and elsewhere, so I want to use this as a launching pad for looking at the issue more closely. The key question is can we reasonably call the departure of the Serb population voluntary? \n\nThe key argument made in favor of this theory by Croatia is that once the scale of the Serbian defeat became clear, the leader of the RSK, [Milan Martić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Marti%C4%87), issued an order requesting the evacuation of Serbs from the region as they could no longer be protected. This fact is not under dispute and indeed it almost certainly helped to convince a part of the Serb population to leave. However, the story neither begins nor ends here. In order to really understand what drove the Serbs from Croatia we need to consider the broader context in which this story is embedded. And the reality is that for the Serbs of Croatia these chaotic days were marked by a palpable terror of what could happen to them if they remained behind. This climate of fear sustained and amplified by wide-scale crimes committed by Croatian soldiers during the operation. Here I will quote from a report by Human Rights Watch that was drafted after an investigation into these events:^(1)\n\n&gt;As soon as Croatian troops assumed control of the Krajina area, widescale and systematic looting and burning of Serbian property began and continued for months after the offensive. [...] U.N. monitors, Croatian and international human rights groups, and others reported a vast array of human rights abuses that occurred after the offensive. No serious effort was made by the Croatian civilian or military authorities to prevent such abuses despite the fact that most of the destruction and serious crimes were at the hands of Croatian Army soldiers, not individual civilian extremists as alleged by the Croatian government. \n\nOf course it wasn't just property that was affected, of the less than 5,000 Serbs who stayed behind in the area affected by Operation Storm, many suffered direct violence:^(1)\n\n&gt;Some Serbs who had not managed to flee the Krajina area were summarily executed, although the full extent of these executions during and immediately after the battle has not been established conclusively. Nevertheless, U.N. investigators report that at least 150 persons were executed during and after Operation Storm in situations unrelated to combat. Estimates by local NGOs of the number of Serbs executed run much higher -- to as high as 700 victims.\n\nLastly, we come to the last part of the argument, namely that international courts purportedly dismissed Croatian responsibility for the flight of the Serbs. Here is the story is quite a bit more messy with a few twists and turns. In a landmark trial of Gotovina *et al.,* named after the Croatian general Ante Gotovina who was in charge of Operation Storm, the court ruled unanimously that there was a joint criminal enterprise (JCE) aimed at \"permanently removing Serbs from Croatia.\"^(2) However later the appellate court issued a controversial split decision of 3-2 that overturned the original decision ruling that there was not enough evidence to substantiate the JCE.^(3) Finally, there was another major case before the international tribunal, namely a clusterfuck of a case called Croatia v Serbia where the two countries accused each other of genocide of ethnic Croats and Serbs respectively. In the end the court threw out this case on the basis that the arguments of neither side were compelling enough. \n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to look at this legal mess and conclude that the court somehow denied that the actions of Croatia were not a factor in the flight of the Serbs. Far from it. The court simply decided that there was not enough evidence to either hold Croatia as a state culpable of ethnic cleansing or to find specific statesmen and generals criminally culpable for the removal of the Serbs. However in all cases the court always accepted the fact that the actions of the Croatian military played a key role in driving the Serbs away. To quote the court decision in Croatia v Serbia:\n\n&gt;In the present case, the Court notes that it is not disputed that a substantial part of the Serb population of the Krajina fled that region as a direct consequence of the military actions carried out by Croatian forces during Operation “Storm”, in particular the shelling of the four towns referred to above. It further notes that the transcript of the Brioni meeting, to which it will return later [...], makes it clear that the highest Croatian political and military authorities were well aware that Operation “Storm” would provoke a mass exodus of the Serb population; they even to some extent predicated their military planning on such an exodus, which they considered not only probable, but desirable. \n\nSo to sum it all up, can we meaningfully label the departure of Serbs from Croatia during Operation Storm as voluntary? I would argue that the evidence clearly shows that such a characterization is misleading to the point of being wrong. The level of effective coercion, including by the very tangible threat of direct violence, to which ethnic Serbs were subjected by the Croatian military quit readily demolished the credibility of this claim. Beyond the historical evidence, this fact is almost made obvious by common sense. Normally [humans don't pack up their meagre belongings unto a tractor and leave their ancestral homes in a mass exodus](https://i.imgur.com/4xsLhNP.jpg) unless they truly fear for their lives.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. \"Croatia: Impunity for abuses committed during \"Operation Storm\" and the denial of the right of refugees to return to the Krajina\".

        "text": "As you might remember, vaguely perhaps, we had a discussion post about how to keep the sub's quality up in the face of higher subscriber numbers, less quality posts, and the ever increasing hostile discussion environment on Reddit as a whole. The tightening of the rules was one change to come out of this and this is another. The point was made that we had too many sticky posts that always sit at the top of the sub and distract from original material. As a result we added a bunch of questions about these topics to the poll we ran and the results of those have now been implemented in the schedule. Going forward you can expect to only see one scheduled sticky post at the top of the sub with the following regular posts:\n\n#Mindless Monday\nThis is the oldest of the scheduled post, so it's only fitting it remains. Initially intended as a community bonding experiment, I think most of us can agree that it works and that it is desirable that we have such a feature in the sub for general venting, to get some sympathy, and share your successes. \n\nOn the flip side **Free-For-All Friday is gone**. Initially implemented by popular demand to have more social posts, now two social posts a week was seen as too much by most of you. I personally hope you'll all change your minds in a couple of months, but for now the rabble gets their way and democracy has spoken. Stupid sexy democracy. \n\n#Small Bad History post\nThis is **not a sticky post**, but I'm listing it here anyway because it's been changed to appear on each Tuesday for now. Since we're allowing debunking requests on Thursdays, it was better to move this to a different day. \n\n#Wondering Wednesday\nBusiness as usual here. This post was popular enough to survive the Menshevik's attempts to kill it. There were a number of requests to do more \"fun\" topics, so I'll do my best to include at least one flippant topic per three week cycle (I schedule them in three week batches), and I'll also be experimenting with an occasional structured discussion topic that's less open to see if people like a more formal discussion from time to time. As usual we're always looking for new topics here, so do ping us in mod mail if you have any ideas for this.  \n\n#Saturday Studies\nNo, you haven't gone mad, it used to be Sunday Studies, but in order to spread the sticky posts a bit more evenly around, we moved this one to Saturday. This way each of the weekly posts has at least two days as the top posts before being unsticky-ed by the next.\n\n#The Fate of the Second sticky Slot\n\nFor now we're keeping it for these types of announcements, but we're still discussing some other options like permanently sticking the rules there.

We only made the end faster, but we spent a shit ton of money that Stalin didn't have to, and allowed Stalin to kill how many later. \n\nWith that said, where do I begin with a post that is basically one long incorrect take on history? I suppose at the start. First sentence doesn't seem relevant since if you don't fight you can't win, but I suppose if he means Germany would have lost even had America (the \"we\" in this context) not tossed troops into the fight, but yes that probably is technically correct (insert futurama gif here). After this however, we get this comment:\n\n&gt; When was the battle for Stalingrad over, Dec 10, 1941.\n\nSo first, this is phrased like a question, but doesn't appear to be one at all. Second, the Battle of Stalingrad didn't even start until 1942, [Wikipedia (best. source. ever.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad) says August of 1942, while other easily sites say July of 1942 (Britannica, so much better!) A guy by the name of Anthony Beevor says its August in a book called Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943, and nobody says its December 10th.. That makes it extremely unlikely that the Second World War was already on its way to conclusion by Dec 10th 1941. Speaking of that random date, I can't quite decide why he picked December 10th. Stalingrad wasn't over until February.\n\n And with that, his entire post is basically wrong, but even on its context I also question the idea that everyone knew the war was over with Stalingrad. Stalingrad was a turning point, but the Germans at least would still mount at least one more offensive at Kursk.\n\nAs an aside, I initially thought he meant Battle of Moscow, but even that didn't end till FEBURARY 1942. \n\nSources: Is labeling my ass inappropriate here?

        "title": "A Reply to Shadiversity: Part One - Introductions and Interpretations",
        "author": "Hergrim",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/96lyn4/a_reply_to_shadiversity_part_one_introductions/",
        "text": "#Introduction\n\n**An Apology**\n\nI’d like to begin this post with an apology to Shad. There were a number of reasons why I called him arrogant, such as my mistaking his bombastic style for arrogance, frustration at my suggestions that leather armour might have been more common than he was saying were seemingly ignored (although I now realise that there were a couple of other ways I could have tried to get hold of him that might have functioned better) and a general unfamiliarity with his channel and willingness to admit to being wrong. **Regardless of these factors, I should still have remained civil and avoided the name calling.** I regret my tone and behaviour at the time, and I’d like to thank Shad for being the bigger man and not escalating things further.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFor those who missed it, I made a post a while back about what I saw as bad history on the part of a popular YouTuber called Shadiversity, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8v1gai/the_real_truth_about_leather_armour/). Shad has [now replied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej38Lv1Kglk) to my post and, after clarifying his position and legitimately taking me to task for the introduction of my post, he has laid out his arguments for why he still thinks that leather armour was not common (see the next section for more on this and my misinterpretation of his position) and why he thinks that textile armour was significantly cheaper than leather.\n\nI disagree very strongly with his position, and I think he commits more bad history - preferring to rely on speculative pricing for a period, at the very least, a thousand years before the period under discussion (mid-12th to mid/late-13th century) and was mostly focused 1200 years or more before, based on a theoretical price list from more than 200 years after the last known use of said armour, over medieval price data - so I’ve decided to not only reply, but keep the replies here in /r/badhistory.\n\nI am not entirely guiltless when it comes to bad history, although my sin is less in the facts than the presentation of them. When I wrote my previous post, I had the mistaken belief that all I needed was to provide sufficient examples to demonstrate that leather armour was common and that artistic sources are not always reliable. The only section where I came even close to good writing was on the relative prices of linen and leather for armour, and even there I failed to provide context in terms of wages of the average free man.\n\nThese series of posts (and there will be several) are aimed at rectifying this error. As before, I won’t be going through the video moment by moment and addressing each point as it’s made. This time, though, I won’t be addressing what I see as Shad’s main points but will instead be making ones of my own. When I refer to Shad's points, it will be to compare and contrast his arguments with my own. My goal is to lay out the arguments for leather armour being common and the context that it was used in so that I can build up a cohesive argument as a whole for when and why it was popular and who used it.\n\nAnother corrective I intend to make is that of sources. Before I essentially paraphrased David Nicolle’s discussion of the sources and didn’t provide direct quotations. This time, however, I intend, wherever possible, to quote the relevant section of primary source in both original and translation. In some rare cases I will need to provide a crude translation of my own, using a combination of dictionaries and Google Translate, but I will highlight those for the wary. I’ll also be giving page numbers for each source in order to make double checking anything I say that much easier.\n\nAs indicated above, this won’t be a short series. As I’m writing this, I’m envisioning at least four more, each focused on a different aspect of my argument. This first post will cover the issue of interpretation, where I will point out some misinterpretations of Shad's, both with regards to myself and his own sources (where I can find them - Shad has only posted a fraction of them and remains reluctant to give out more; if anyone knows about the forum threads where tanners give their opinions on the ideal age to kill a cow for leather armour, I'd be grateful if you'd tell me). \n\nThe second post will focus on the issues of art and archaeology in relation to textile and leather armour. Although I have now found some earlier examples (and possible examples) of aketons worn under mail, they are still almost non-existent in the pictorial record and even sometimes entirely denied by this record (such as the Morgan Bible). Similarly, very few depictions of leather armour exist and are almost entirely relating to the wealthy. The archaeological record is similarly bare, with only two examples of textile defense existing that I’m aware of, and only limb, horse and tournament armour for leather. I intend to explain why the artwork only shows wealthy men in leather armour for the period under consideration, discuss some of the problems inherent in interpreting artwork and put the archaeological finds in their context and point out the limitations of these finds.\n\nThe third post is going to be all about those who wore leather armour, their recruitment and their roles in society. Most medieval infantry were not poor levied peasants, but professional mercenaries, town militias or the wealthier members of common society. There are exceptions to this (especially in England at the end of our period), and they’ll be mentioned and contextualised. The higher ranks of society and their use of leather armour will also be examined.\n\nThe fourth post will focus on the construction of leather and textile armour, the costs - human and monetary - and also the arms trade. I intend to put use of armour into the proper economic and cultural context to highlight why leather was not as expensive as Shad is assuming and why textile armour was not as cheap as he has made it out to be. Also considered will be the work of Professor Gregory S. Aldrete and why his conclusions must be used with extreme caution.\n\nWhat will hopefully be the fifth and final post will be a synthesis of the previous posts and will bring it all to a conclusion that will show how and why leather armour was both relatively inexpensive (**within the context of armour**) and common (**within the context of warfare**).\n\nSome of these posts might be split into two parts, but I will do my best to be as concise as possible. I know it might seem like I’m being needlessly tangential and wordy at times, but I promise to keep my writing as focused and relevant to the discussion as I’m able to.\n\n#On Matters of Interpretation\n\nIn his reply to my post, Shad believes that I constructed strawmen arguments and took what he said out of context (4:48-9:00). While I’ll admit that there were one or two comments that clearly hinted at Shad not entirely disbelieving in the use of leather torso armour, I’m not convinced that a couple of his other comments were sufficiently clear - even with the clearer comments for context - for my original interpretation to be invalid. Whatever strawmen I may have constructed in my original post, they were my honest impression of Shad’s arguments. I did think about defending myself further, but it would serve no purpose. **My interpretation of Shad’s arguments was not what he intended**, this has been made clear, and going down into the minutia of it all would be boring and pointless for all involved.\n\nHowever, I’m not the only one who has created strawman arguments. Shad misinterprets a number of statements by myself and Professor Aldrete in his video, and at least one of them seriously impacts his rejection of one aspect of my argument (18:30-19:58). The others serve as examples of how easy it is for your own perspective to warp the arguments of someone else.\n\n&gt;“So that is really interesting. Linen can be made in a much cheaper way, and in fact the cheap type of linen is *better* for armour production. That is significant!” (23:04-23:15). \n\nThis is in response to a video clip of a lecture by Professor Gregory S. Aldrete that Shad included in his video (19:59-23:04). However, this is not at all what was said. Professor Aldrete actually says is that they discovered that modern linen - entirely machine made - performs significantly worse than linen that is made entirely by hand, from start to finish (22:05-23:04). There is no suggestion that the cheaper types of historical linen made for better armour than the more expensive types. The closest Professor Aldrete comes to this is mentioning that there were coarser types of linen available that were cheaper than the more expensive types, making the argument of cost irrelevant in the leather vs linen debate (20:20-23:15; in the context of the Type IV armour, specifically). \n\nMisinterpretation aside, this is also a not much of an argument against my examples. Even if the cheapest cloth was the best, this would in no way invalidate my comments on price. When I listed the range of prices for linen, I noted that it could range from 2d to 8.25d per ell, but was most often 4d per ell. I deliberately used cheapest cloth - and the smallest possible *amount* of cloth - specifically to show that, even when the cheapest cloth is used, textile armour is still expensive. A ten layer jack - which won’t offer enough protection to be used by itself ([Ordinance of St. Maximin de Tréves](http://www.wolfeargent.com/ordonnances.htm)) - is going to cost 46d (3s.10d.) even with cloth priced 2d per ell, and 2.3 ells of cloth required per layer rather than a possible 3.7 ells. Compare this is Shad's claim that the cheapest cloth would still be cheaper than leather armour (26:56-27:08) and the price I gave for leather armour in my previous post (3s), and the weakness of his argument can be seen.\n\nThe response to this will no doubt be that, as Shad suggests (26:00-26:56), the common soldier had more chance of accessing homemade cloth than homemade leather armour. While this is true, it's also heavily based on the misconception of self-sufficient (or mostly so) medieval households. I plan on going into more depth on this subject in my fourth post, but for now I'd like to raise the point that, even with the slave economy of Classical Athens, many households were not self-sufficient and three adult women were required to meet the demands of a household of six (Acton, p155-156). In later medieval Europe - which lacked a slave economy - large scale cloth manufacturing had moved to the towns, where the horizontal loom could as much as six times the amount of cloth as a vertical loom by the 12th and 13th centuries (Henry, p140-144; It began to replace vertical looms from the early 11th century on, but even so took a century or more to fully dominate the trade) and, although it continued to form an important part of estate and rural production, this was in the form of rural based specialists rather than individual peasant production (Henry, p140, 142; Dyer, p108 c.f. the rural/industrial village of Lyveden on p99). Most households would have concentrated on producing thread for dedicated (or semi-dedicated) weavers rather than the cloth itself. \n\nFurther, even if the soldier was taken from a cloth producing household, using cloth which had been produced in the household would still be a significant loss, since all the labour and money (paid for pre-spun thread) will go into making his armour instead of cloth that will be sold for a profit. The loss of profit and cost of production will have an end cost nearly as great as buying the cloth itself. This is the problem of applying generalisations from one pre-modern economy to another, substantially different, pre-modern economy without fully following through the implications of the differences or considering the economic effect of suddenly not having cloth to sell or make into clothing.\n\n&gt;“The author of the Reddit article does try and explore the effectiveness of leather armour versus gambeson, and he’s obviously taking the point of view that he thinks that leather armour is superior to gambeson.” (29:36-29:48) \n\nI think I was pretty clear about my stance on the issue of current testing and protection: “As a result, the precise protective qualities of each armour can't really be determined.” That is to say, the best tests performed so far have been sufficiently flawed (as I pointed out in the paragraph above my quote) that no conclusions could be drawn. His comments that I found one test where leather performed better than textile armour, but that he's found other tests where the opposite is true and so there are obviously some variables involved (29:55-30:10) is exactly the point I made myself:\n\n&gt;There are some limitations to these examples. The linen armour used by Jones would almost certainly have performed better if it had been quilted, while Williams probably wasn't using boiled rawhide as his cuir-bouilli, which offers better protection than boiled leather, and his blade was short (40mm) and designed to simulate the cut of a polearm, not a sword.\n\nThe tests conducted by Alan Williams, which I quoted in comparison to David Jones' tests should also have made it clear that I didn't think there was sufficient evidence to argue one way or the other and that textile armour could (and did) perform better than leather in **some testing contexts**. While I didn't select the two tests because of their contrasting results (again, I believe they're the two best tests overall, for all their flaws), I did use them for this purpose and then explained why each test was flawed and **why we have insufficient data to make any judgments**.\n\n&gt;“And it’s almost like, maybe I’m misreading this one, because, you know, it’s a big article. Was he implying that gambeson was never worn under mail? ‘Cause that is incorrect, *of course* gambeson was worn under mail. In fact, one of his own sources that he lists in his own thing explicitly says that gambeson was worn under mail.” (34:57-35:12) \n\nWhile I’ll credit Shad with not being definite about this one, I was very clear about this point:\n\n&gt;While we have good textual evidence of aketons being worn under mail from the mid-12th century on and also have an extent fragment of one (the Sleeve of St. Martin) that dates from the somewhere between the mid-12th and mid-13th century, we have no artistic evidence of anything being worn under mail other than a linen shirt through almost to the end of the 13th century. The Morgan Bible, although it has a couple of instances of [gambesons being](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b4/7b/9f/b47b9f6cc1a64773ae08957748da22d5.jpg) [worn over mail](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8c/d8/a9/8cd8a94cb8eba1615a4abc7cfa00a151.jpg), explicitly shows that mail was worn over nothing but an ordinary tunic. This is despite some pretty good textual evidence of the practice from the same time period.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, it could just be that aketons weren't used by everyone until the end of the 13th century, or it could be that they were so often under the mail that most manuscript illuminators didn't know they existed or how to draw them until much later on. Whatever the case may be, the point is that art alone can't be used to confirm or deny the existence of a type of armour. It needs to be used in conjunction with a raft of other sources to be properly interpreted.\n\nI’ve since found evidence to make me qualify my emphasis on there being no artistic depictions of aketons being worn under mail before the late 13th century (David Nicolle’s *Arms and Armour of the Crusading Era* has a couple of examples from between the early 12th to early 13th century, entirely from Spain, and I now know of a small handful of other possible examples from the 12th century), my original point still stands. There are almost no artistic examples of aketons being worn under armour, despite having “good textual evidence of aketons being worn under mail from the mid-12th century on and also an extent fragment of one (the Sleeve of St. Martin) that dates from the somewhere between the mid-12th and mid-13th century.” I was very much **not** saying, suggesting or implying that aketons were never worn under mail, just that they were never (now modified to “almost never”) depicted, even in quite realistic and detailed manuscript illuminations.\n\nClaude Blair, who I assume is the source Shad is referencing, says much the same thing:\n\n&gt;”It is probable that the various types of soft armour were in use during the whole of the period covered by this chapter, although I have been unable to trace any definite evidence of this earlier than the second half of the 12th century. Surprisingly enough, neither does there seem to be any indication of the use of a special quilted garment under the hauberk before the same period, although one would have deemed something of the sort essential in view of the complete lack of rigidity of mail. Yet it can actually be shown that as late as the middle of the 13th century the hauberk was sometimes worn without any separate padding underneath, other than a quilted cap. The magnificent French MS. of *c.* 1250 known as the *Maciejowski Bible* (Pierpoint Morgan Library, New York), for example, contains a number of illustrations showing hauberks being put on and removed; in every case the only garment worn underneath is a knee-length coloured shirt with tight fitting, wrist-length sleeves.” (Blair, p32-33)\n\nand\n\n&gt; “The aketon worn under the armour seems generally to have been of the long-sleeved type described above, although it is rarely possible to catch a glimpse of its edges in contemporary illustrations.” (Blair, p34; the illustrations mentioned are all from the 14th century)\n\nI intend to go into more detail on this subject in my next post, but hopefully we're now on the same page when it comes to issue of interpreting artwork. **Sometimes it just doesn't match with what the textual evidence says, even when said artwork is very good**.\n\n#TL:DR\n\nI apologised to Shad, warned ya'll that this is going to be a very long series, and then went on to demonstrate that I'm not alone in misinterpreting information in a way that's more favorable to myself/less favorable to my ideological opponent. My next post will be on the problems involved in interpreting artwork and archaeology. Hopefully I'll have it done within a couple of weeks!\n\n#References\n\n* *European Armour*, by Claude Blair\n* *Arms and Armour of the Crusading Era*, by David Nicolle (1988)\n* *Poiesis, Manufacturing in Classical Athens*, by Peter Acton\n* \"Technological Development in Late Saxon Textile Production: its relationship to an emerging market economy\nand changes in society\" (1998). *Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings*. 175., by Philippa A.

Anyway, moving on to the changes taking place:\n\n**Sources are now a requirement** \\- To enforce this, the minimum standard is a bibliography, simply list your sources at the end of the post. We decided to keep it simple to make sure posts don't take forever and because people like to keep it simple. But, if you want to score bonus karma, I would recommend an annotated bibliography or even  detailed citations like the pros.\n\n**Wikipedia is now restricted to basic fact checking** \\- That's right, no more posts with 20-30 wiki links and quick paraphrases, you need to use *real* sources. To clarify basic fact checking instances, examples include but are not limited to: names, geography, dates and statistics.\n\n**We will not add moratoriums** \\- This is pretty simple and an unofficial poll has happened on this already. A majority of the sub feels content should be allowed from anywhere, even the deepest cesspools of the internet, so we will allow it as long as the content itself does not break any rules. The above restrictions should prevent anything too low-effort or shitpost-tier coming up anyway.\n\n**Requests are now on a regular schedule** \\- Found bad history but lack the skills to make a debunk? Make a post asking for it on the sub! **Only from 0:00GMT Thursday to 0:00GMT Saturday though. See the new Rule 5 for more details.** Replies that exceed character limit should ideally be chained together, similar to how r/AskHistorians does it. We'll be going with GMT because most mods are European and it's the most familiar time zone to everyone. Yes, that does mean you have about 3.5 hours from this post to send one in, **QUICK!** Also, it's recommended that **ordinary posts avoid Thursday** in order to get better attention. We won't stop you if that's convenient though!\n\nEdit: It seems nobody made a request in that very short space of time. A shame!\n\nThat's all, if anyone has anything else they want to change then feel free to send a modmail, make a vocal post in response to something you dislike (upvotes make this a better voice sometimes) or just reply to this post and get angry at me.",

        "text": "We’re back with our favourite chartist-library-of-Alexandria-phile, here to tell us his general views on Oliver Stone’s “Alexander” (2004). As always its filled with just the generalisations and bad history you might expect from someone calling themselves a history buff! So without further ado…\n\n**[History Buffs: Alexander Revisited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzHQuAz0N60&amp;ab_channel=HistoryBuffs)**\n\n0:05 Cleopatra is black now  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n0:12 My exact reaction to having to review this video\n\n1:20 Well I would say historical authenticity than accuracy, as we will shortly point out.\n\n2:12 Side note here, but Alexander is actually not titled as “the Great” until the 2nd Century BCE by Roman scholars. None of the Diadochi or Epigoni ever entitled him as “the Great”\n\n2:21 Ok here we go onto the flashy resume of Alexander III, which I’m sure everyone has heard of before. Lets tackle them one by one:\n\n*”Revolutionised Ancient Warfare”*\n\nOk well this hits a bit close to home. Alexander, like so many “great men” of history, are not some singular entity that shifts history on their mere whim but tend to be someone at the right place at the right time. Thus really the credit for the military reforms of the Macedonian Kingdom lies more with Philip II than Alexander. However still Philip II did not simply invent these new army tactics and equipment, he himself stood on the shoulders of contemporary military geniuses such as Epaminondas, Xenophon, Iphicrates, etc. All men he met as a child and would have studied in the courts of Pella and Thebes. And even then, they themselves evolved warfare in their times. That is the fundamental aspect, is that true military revolutionization occurs more gradually than all at once. Philip himself did not overnight institute a professional war machine in 359, rather he did so gradually over his numerous and various campaigns across Greece. \n\n*“Never lost a battle”*\n\nNow this is technically true, in that he never died in battle as that being a metric of “never lost”. To say he was never defeated is a bit less honest. One only needs to look at the battle of the Persian Gate where alexander definitely saw an initial and serious defeat by Ariobarzanes before himself being betrayed in the same style as the Greeks at Thermopylae.\n\n2:33 Well not a tyrant, but an absolute monarch. In this context there is a clear difference.\n\n2:43 Pella being interestingly placed where Aegae was at.\n\n3:08 Conquer Greece is a not really what he did, he more became hegemon as Sparta, Athens and Thebes had done in the pass. His creation of the League of Corinth showed odd mercy and integration for a conqueror.\n\n3:24 Yes so warry that he made him regent over Macedonia in 340 BCE, allowed him to lead the companion cavalry at Chaeronea and reinstated him as regent in his campaign in Persia.\n\n4:11 Well Alexander did have pretty, at the time, legitimate ties to Heracles and Achilles from both of his parents, interestingly enough. Philip was of the Argaed dynasty, who claimed lineage from the founder of the ancient city of Argos, Temenus, who’s father was Heracles. This was a mutual lineage with both kings of Sparta and the leading family of Larissa in Thessaly. To them this would have been seen as truth as they needed it to have the legitimacy to rule. Likewise, Olympias was from the Molossians in Epirus, who claimed descendance from Achilles. Thus, Alexander was in a unique position to have Achilles and Heracles in his pedigree. Whether or not this fed into some sense of narcissism of self-deification growing up is doubtful at best. For really any hint of this attitude only seems to come out at all when he consults the oracle at Siwah, and even then this was merely to reassert his legitimacy to rule an area way beyond that of Macedonia.\n\n4:40 Alright I’ll take a quick pause here since here he is clearly referring to the slight by Attalus at the wedding of Philip and Eurydice. Now this is quite interesting, as the events depicted in the movie is accurate to how it is detailed in ancient sources. However the actual significance of the event is up to question. As Ian Worthington theorises, Attalus’ comment was unlikely to have been a slight at the legitimacy of Alexander as an heir but rather to cut Alexander down a peg as he might have been bragging about his ability at Chaeronea to slay the Theban Sacred Band on his own. Furthermore to say that having a mother that isn’t Macedonian makes you illegitimate or at least ineligible for the throne probably wouldn’t have gone down well with Philip, seeing as how his mother, Eurydice, was likely an Epirot or Paeonian.\n\n4:54 *“Now there are a lot of theories as to why Philip was assassinated”* \n\nSo let me go with the most controversial one! Trusting Justin at face value is like believing what the Daily Mail says causes cancer…\n\n5:06 *”…and the other theory, and this is the theory that I do believe, was that Alexander and Olympias were responsible.”* sigh\n\nPhilip’s assassination was like the JFK of the ancient world because he was at the peak of his power ready to launch his invasion of the Achaemenid empire. Understandably such a public execution at this moment was shocking and unforeseeable. However to believe that Alexander and Olympias planned the assassination is doubtful. So let’s go through each of these reasoning he gives.\n\n5:13 *“Philip was marrying Attalus’ niece, Eurydice, who was a Macedonian woman…”*\n\nThe general idea that Alexander had any real threat of Eurydice and a possible son taking him over as heir to the Macedonian throne is doubtful for two main reasons. \n\nA)\tPhilip already had already married a fully Macedonian wife in 359 BCE when his brother and king, Perdiccas III, arranged Philip (then governor of Eastern Macedonia) to Phila daughter of Derdas II of Elimeia in Upper Macedonia. And that was Philip’s first marriage. Olympias, on the other hand, was the fourth marriage and Alexander his second son after Arrhideaus who was illegible because of a mental disorder.\n\nB)\tBefore Philip was about to depart to Asia and join the vanguard force he had appointed Alexander as co-regent of the Corinthian League and regent of Macedonian in his leave. As is apparent from Antipater when he fit this same role during Alexander’s reign, this position was a huge responsibility. Thus, Philip must have had significant trust and faith in Alexander to maintain hegemony in Greece and keep the heart of the empire functional. Now if Philip thought that a son by Eurydice was heir material its unlikely that he would leave Alexander in such a position in the capital and in Greece to gain influence and power rather than a close ally such as Parmenion or Antipater.\n\n\n5:17 *”Since Olympias was from Epirus, she was considered to be an outsider”*\n\nIts true that the Epirots were naturally enemies… like Paeonians and Macedonians… or Thracians and Macedonians… Or Macedonians and other Macedonians… damn Macedonians ruined Macedon! \n\nTruth is that Philip had made an unprecedented mending of Macedonia and its neighbours through his diplomatic marriages and general diplomacy. In fact the wedding at which Philip was assassinated was that between Alexander of Epirus (Olympias’ brother) and Cleopatra (Alexander III’s sister), so marrying the sister of the heir to the throne to an Epirot, were they looked down upon, seems rather odd. Also Olympias had considerable influence in both the courts in Pella and Molossian, she was largely the most dominant wife of Philip in both power and influence thus even with Eurydice her power was unlikely to have been in danger.\n\n5:25 *”If Eurydice had a son with Philip then he would be a full blooded Macedonian and be the legitimate heir to the throne”*\n\nThat is not how Macedonian succession worked… at all\n\n5:38 *”…conveniently stabbed to death”*\n\nI’m not too sure that due process was ever an option for Pausanias. In fact according to Diodorus (so take it with a grain of salt) Pausanias may have been willing to die as his teacher, Hermocrates the sophist, gave the advice to fame that “…by killing the one who had accomplished the most, for just as long as he was remembered, so long his slayer would be remembered too”. Although this could just be dramatic storytelling  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n5:40 *”…which is suspicious, especially taking into account the aftermath where Olympias had Eurydice and his half brother murdered along with anyone else who challenged the threat to his legitimacy”*\n\nWow, alright. So funny how often he is almost correct. Let’s start off with the general gist of what he is saying. It is true that Alexander killed off almost anyone who threatened his throne, legitimacy or he just wanted to purge (RIP Attalus). However to suggest that this was anything unusual for the succession between Macedonian Kings is woefully ignorant. One only needs to look at the succession of the 5 kings and regents between ~390 BCE and ~360 BCE to see how absolutely Machiavellian and chaotic they usually were. In fact Alexander’s succession was by far one of the smoothest in Macedonian history with how well he retained the unity of the kingdom and hegemony over Greece.\n\nNow onto Olympias’ apparent game of whack a mole. Olympias likely only had one person killed and that was Eurydice and her child to cut some loose ends, but to suggest that she went about it in any unprecedented way is false. We only have to look at how Amyntas IV (legitimate heir to Perdicass III in 359) and Arrhidaeus along with all of Alexander’s other siblings (Cleopatra, Thessalonike, etc.). According to Arrian, Amyntas IV only saw the sword when Alexander’s opponents attempted to raise him as a pretender when he was away. But Arrhidaeus actually outlived Alexander by about 5 years and would succeed Alexander after his death as a puppet king under the Diadochi. However in the end he did get assassinated by Olympias if not close to 20 years later.\n\n7:53 *”…there are glaring inaccuracies in Alexander”*\n\nIn typical History Buff fashion, he’ll nitpick one or two details and ignore many other huge issues such as incorrect equipment for the Achaemenids that look like they’re fighting at Marathon to the absolute absence of Arrhidaeus who plays a critical role in the Diadochi period that follows Alexander.\n\n10:43 *”however there are two inaccuracies that kinda bother me in this movie”*\n\nHERE WE GO!\n\n11:12 *”Remember, this was the guy who named over 70 cities after himself”*\n\nThat is not true at all. The 70 cities that Plutarch refers to largely includes temporary forts and garrisons across his empire so to claim he founded 70 cities is a bit dishonest. Altogether Alexander claim close to 20 Alexandrias, however only of which stuck, most of them were just renamed as such but were more often than not referred to more by their second half of their name.\n\n12:12 He proceeds to go on about the march of Alexander’s army through the Gedrosian desert and how the film claims to be false when it claims that going through the Gedrosian was the quickest route and that there were other factors at play. \n\nIn this he is partially correct again. Although the Gedrosian desert was the quickest way home traveling though the graveyard of armies was not purely because of this fact, in that he is correct. But he misses the mark and claims it was some grand punishment to his army for losing the morale to fight any further. Now from what we know from ancient sources and the context of the journey this is absolutely ludicrous. Alexander wasn’t dumb enough to shoot himself in the foot by crossing the Gedrosia purely for some punishment, nor did he at first plan to lose so many men in doing so. The grand reason that Alexander wanted to cross the Gedrosia was to emulate and out-succeed Cyrus II who failed to march his army across the Gedrosia and thought to beat him in this feat as he had in his conquest (this was aimed to further legitimise his rule as Master of Asia). \n\nAlso, as Arrian tells us, losing thousands of men to attrition was clearly not his goal. Alexander sent his companion and naval explorer Nearchus to sail side by side along the coast for reasons twofold, to explore the Arabian peninsula/Persian Gulf and to supply the troops as they marched across the Gedrosia. As is the case with most ancient logistics this promptly fell apart from the beginning as Arrian details in his own Anabasis spinoff following Nearchus. Nearchus got lost, distracted raiding the local people, and Alexander with the army got horribly lost in the desert as they lost the coast leading to critical supply shortages. Now even if you thought this might have been some crazy Info-Wars esque conspiracy for Alexander to starve his veteran men, this too is unlikely as Arrian relates that when they were low on water the men collected what water they could and gave it to the king only for him to promptly pour it out onto the ground claiming that he will parched with them. Now whether this is propaganda or not is unclear, regardless we can determine that Alexander likely didn’t have the intention to kill his own troops as History Buffs claims.\n\n12:26 *”And the last inaccuracy is on Alexander’s death bed…”*\n\nOH BOI CAN’T WAIT TO HEAR THIS ONE!\n\nHe proceeds to claim that the way the movie tells the story wherein Alexander dies unable to speak and dies without naming the heir IS LESS LIKELY than diodorus’ claim that Alexander wanted to cause some grand battle royale for the empire by claiming “The Strongest”. BAH THIS IS SO STUPID!\n\nAlexander at this point was clearly unable to speak nor move beyond simple movement. The only credible accounts we have of what he did on his deathbed claimed he did nothing but stare or pass his ring onto Perdicass who was his second in command in Babylon, not as a succession to the throne but in administrative control. And so started the Diadochi period.\n\nThe rest of the review goes onto the reasons why the movie did poorly from its script and acting to its production. I won’t continue from here since he stops with his review of the history of Alexander so I weep for there is no more bad history to correct.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nIan Worthington’s “By the Spear” and “Philip II of Macedon”\n\nRobin Waterfield “Dividing the Spoils”\n\nPlutarch “Life of Alexander”\n\nArrian “The campaigns of Alexander”\n\nDiodorus Siculus “Library of History” Book XVI\n\nDavid Karunanithy “The Macedonian War Machine”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Pastor James Manning ignores all of African history to claim that Africans built nothing in over 3000 years",
        "author": "mscott734",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/948sp7/pastor_james_manning_ignores_all_of_african/",
        "text": "[Link to Video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98XHA9fKXI0) This is actually a mirror of the original video. Hilariously, last night, while I was in the middle of writing and researching this post, James Manning’s channel was terminated by Youtube. I don’t know why, or rather there are so many possible reasons that I don’t know which it was, but I’m glad that youtube is an ever so slightly better place now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHello fellow historians! Today I’ll be looking at a bit of bad history from ATLAH Worldwide and its creator James Manning. James Manning, or as he refers to himself “the honorable James David Manning PHD” is an American preacher with the craziest life story I’ve ever heard. Manning was a criminal who converted to Christianity in 1978 and then got a masters degree in Divinity in 1985. Then, supposedly, in 1991 he spoke to the Holy Ghost who told him that he needed to save Harlem which had been designated as a holy land for Black people, also the Holy Ghost told him that the new name of Harlem should be Atlah. Manning then started a fake university where he granted himself a doctorate and began preaching about how the “faggots and the lezbos” were ruining Harlem, and how “n*ggerism” destroyed Detroit. He’s basically a real life version of Uncle Ruckus from The Boondocks.\n\nIn the video I’ll be discussing Manning claims that Africans have never built anything in the last 3000 years. The video is rife with inaccuracies and unfortunately it had amassed around 3 million views before it was deleted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo starting off we have some classic badhistory. No, not everyone in the pre-Columbian world thought that the world was flat. Most people knew that the Earth was round and Eratosthenes had calculated the Earth’s circumference relatively accurately as far back as the 3rd century BC.\n\nManning then claims that no white man EVER set foot on the continent of Africa during the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, or 15th century. Somebody should tell that to the Greeks, the Romans, the Crusaders, and the Portuguese all of whom had been to Africa. In particular the Portuguese, by the latter half of the 15th century, not only held land in modern day Morocco but had also already begun rounding the Cape of Good Hope and establishing trading posts along the African coast in places like Angola.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter this Manning says that the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, and “the beautiful buildings in Russia” were built in a similar time to centuries he just mentioned. The Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China were both built in the 17th century so it’s not exactly accurate to say that they were built at a similar time to the 11th through 15th centuries. As for the “beautiful buildings in Russia” I have no clue what he’s talking about. He follows this bit up with an anecdote about St. Petersburg so I think it’s fair to assume he’s talking about the buildings in St. Petersburg, which is a city that wasn’t even founded until the 18th century so that’s also inaccurate. However if he was talking about Moscow then that’s fine because the Kremlin was built in the 15th century.\n\nWhat follows this is some bad geography where Manning claims that Moscow is on Russia’s West coast, it’s actually very far inland, and that Peter the Great built St. Petersburg on the edge of the Black Sea, when he actually built it on the edge of the Baltic Sea.\n\nThis is followed up with some strange misinformation where Manning claims that Lenin changed the name of the city from St. Petersburg to Leningrad.This is untrue as St Petersburg’s name was first changed during WW1 to Petrograd in order to sound less German and then changed to Leningrad after Lenin’s death.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo apparently Manning has been to Africa, at least according to his Wikipedia page, which leads me to believe that he just didn’t look around much when he was there. Because if he had he would not be claiming that the the largest African kingdoms built nothing! There are many buildings and cities in Africa, built by Africans, that are still standing today. There are the mosques built by the Songhai, the churches in Axum, the older parts of the city in Zanzibar, and just about every tourist trap in Egypt including the pyramids, the sphinx and the Valley of the Kings. All of these were built by African civilizations and can be seen today.And the most powerful kingdoms in African history didn’t live in tents around campfires, they had cities. Mali had its capital at Niani, Benin had its capital in Edo, Axum had its capital in the city of Axum. None of these ancient cities were made up of tents, They were all built by Black Africans, and these and many other African cities date back far earlier than European settlement in Africa.\n\nHonestly, Manning should look into Ethiopia, a nation which existed independently from the 13th century (it’s arguable to say earlier but this is a definite point) all the way to the 20th century when it was invaded by Italy, and then after WW2 was over it returned to being an independent nation and remains one to this day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nManning then discusses Cecil Rhodes, saying he was one of the first to venture into South Africa. This is also not true as settlement by Europeans in South Africa had begun as early as the 17th century while Cecil Rhodes wouldn’t arrive there until the 19th. On a similar point, When Cecil Rhodes went to Africa for the first time he had not made money through enterprise and business as Manning claims. He was a 17 year old boy when he first went to South Africa and he spent his first year in South Africa helping his brother manage their failing cotton farm.\n\nAnother major geography error. Manning confuses Zimbabwe for Lesotho, claiming that Zimbabwe is a small nation within a nation, completely encircled by South Africa. \n\nAnd coming back to Zimbabwean history that Manning gets wrong, The king of Matabeleland, Lobengula, did not rise up in revolt against an unfair contract that he had signed with Cecil Rhodes. Lobengula’s fight against the British began in 1893 when a local chief, who had previously paid homage to Lobengula, refused to pay tribute to Lobengula due to the chief now being under the protection of the British. Lobengula sought to extract tribute from the chief and launched a raid on his territory. The British went to protect the chief’s lands to save face and engaged the raiders, subsequently they invaded Matabeleland and by 1897 Matabeleland had been absorbed into Southern Rhodesia. The Rudd Concession was a different, though related, affair.\n\nManning then gives an anecdote, which I cannot find a source for, about kids in Zimbabwe playing with diamonds in the 19th century while not knowing how valuable the rocks they were playing with were. Manning intends for this story to demonstrate how backwards the people of Africa were but it really just demonstrates that diamonds don’t have intrinsic value and are more or less useless to a society that doesn’t have electricity. \n\nAfter this Manning returns to his original incorrect point, saying that there are no cities that were built by Black people. I won’t repeat my argument from earlier again here but I’ve already provided examples of several cities built by Black people. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA very strange error which comes up next is that Manning claims that Hitler’s Luftwaffe bombed Germany when he obviously means England. Usually I’d say this is just a misspoken word but he immediately follows it up by saying that there’s a city in Germany called Coventry. This leads me to believe that manning literally can’t tell the difference between England and Germany, which wouldn’t be unusual with his history of geography errors in this video alone.\n\nThese errors are part of Manning’s overall anecdote about how Churchill allowed the bombing of Coventry to happen to avoid allowing the Nazis to know that the Allies had cracked the Enigma code. The only issue is that this story is believed to be false by most historians who assert that Churchill knew that a raid was going to occur but was unaware of what the target was.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n After this Manning seemingly has a breakdown on stage yelling about how “there aint never been no city in Africa” which is obviously false. Manning spends the next two minutes of the video yelling absolute nonsense and just repeating the lie that Black people never built anything. He does however close with the statement that “anyplace there’s more than 300 of us, it’s a ghetto” which is demonstrably false as there are upper middle class suburbs in New York, Maryland, and California that are majority black. This doesn’t even mention the historical example of Tulsa Oklahoma in which had a prosperous black community of over 10,000 residents in the neighborhood of Greenwood during the early 20th century before it was destroyed in the Tulsa Race Riots.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd with that I’m done with this video. Honestly Manning is just such a scumbag. He’s trying to spread lies in order to convince African Americans that they should have no pride in their history. I think the weirdest part about manning is that I have difficulty figuring out what his motives even are with telling these kinds of lies. My best guess is that he wants people to not have pride in their past so that they’ll be more open to abandoning it and joining his scam of a church. But that’s just my hypothesis and seeing as his channel is now deleted it’s unlikely I’ll ever figure out his true motives beyond just being a hateful person looking to enrich himself. I’d like to thank you all for reading this and I hope that you’ve all enjoyed it. Have a wonderful day!",

        "text": "Lately, I have been seeing some people use the Lebanese Civil War to justify their anti-refugee/anti-Muslim sentiment. They claim Lebanon was the \"Paris of the Middle East\" until the Muslim refugees came and ruined it. I have seen people say Lebanon was a first world country (I have no response to that)\n\nHere are some problems I have with the first claim:\n\n1) First of all, not all Palestinians are Muslim. The PLO was secular and they had Christian fighters. So it's wrong to portray the Palestinian factions that were involved as Islamists. \n\n2) Muslims made up a significant portion of Lebanon's population long before the arrival of refugees. In 1932, Muslims were 48% of the population and Christians were 51%. \n\nSource: http://dro.dur.ac.uk/96/1/59DMEP.pdf \n\n3) Lebanon has always been a small country, with various different religious groups/sects. In the 70's and 80's, they had a population of TWO million. Lebanon's \"refugee crisis\" is a lot different from Europe's \"refugee crisis\". There is NOT going to be a civil war in Romania because they took in two thousand Syrians. \n\nThat's all I have to say. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not an expert on this topic, so I would like to hear your responses to these claims. What was Lebanon like before the civil war regarding education, health, and women's rights. Were they really more advanced than their neighbors?\n\n\n",

If you have a burning itch to send us further recommendations (Especially in certain very tiny categories) then feel free to send us a modmail. Thank you all for your glorious contributions to the sub!**\n\nHello all, we have decided to create a bad history themed reading list, but as you can imagine it's a lot of work for just the mods. So, it has been decided that in spite of how whacky you mortals can be sometimes, maybe your ideas are *gulp* worth considering.\n\nLeave us suggestions and I'll be updating this list. Vetting is fairly basic though, reading all those books would take forever, so if you have any strong objections then please feel free to fight to the death.\n\nTo clarify bad history themed, we mean things like common mistakes people make about history, works criticising certain 'experts' and their methodology or heck even \"Top 10 misconceptions about Jesus\" will do.\n\nEdit: Satirical bad history books are also welcome, we like to have a sense of humour.\n\nEdit 2: As a diverse community, we can take untranslated works, but you'll need to prove quality since we probably can't.\n\nEdit 3: Added categories to make this less messy. Also if your suggestion isn't on the list and I didn't explain why, please say because I might have missed it or forgot!\n\nEdit 4: Due to continuing suggestions, this thread will remain a full week.
