        "text": "I already read a little over the years about how it's a thing, but I wonder if there are any teams out there really digging in to all the details, like keeping track of men from richest and most frequently traveling, especially the ones who are already known or at least highly suspected of getting prostitutes or otherwise one-night stands.\n\nTake for example, a couple celebrities/CEO's currently in the news cycle for, among other things, having over a dozen children with other women. Those are only the ones they tell us about. What about all the times those people flew to south east Asian, or that island of underage sex slaves? Each one of these people could have impregnated hundreds of women every year, maybe at least one or two per night.\n\nWho knows? With all the drugs and alcohol that those rich men frequently use on themselves to willingly destroy all their self control, with the literally millions of millionaires out there who seem to be cheating on their wives or still just being plain single and impregnating... We could have entire cities where a significant percentage of them relate to one of a few \"frequent flyers\".\n\nBack then, the rich and the royal, like kings and their many official and unofficial concubines, would create bastard children left and right. That's partly why so many people look alike, because in reality they actually are that closely related. All the cover-ups, the assassinations, the hush money pay-offs... Who knows how many unknown siblings are actually out there.\n\nAnyone have really good resources to learn more of those details?",

Implying that the radio waves have a spatial width to them that gets reflected / cannot pass through metal holes smaller than its wavelength (roughly).  \n\nI accepted this for a long time, but then I doubted myself.   Are radio waves / photons (take an individual photon) really covering centimeters of transverse space as they travel through the air/vacuum?   \n\nIn the traditional representation of the EM wave, the wavelength is the peak and troughs *in the direction of travel*, not the magnitude of the wave transverse to the travel direction.    Actually the \"amplitude\" of the wave shown in usual textbook diagrams is never really explained, if you think about it -- at least at the beginner's level.\n\nSo, if you take a single radio photon or wave as it travels, is it actually covering centimeters side to side as it travels?  Is it correct to say that anything smaller than this dimension is not \"seen\" by the radio wave?  \n\nI wish I had some thought experiment to help me work this out for myself, but have reached a mental dead end!",

They ate the powder, and they did not have a reaction, even though the powder contained nuts. They did not have a reaction as they expected not to have one. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. No histamine was released.\n\nThe others were told the powder contains nuts and when they ate the powder, they had a reaction since they expected to have one, even though this powder did not contain nuts. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. They had a significant, measurable histamine reaction because they expected to have one.\n\nMost importantly, what this study showed is that when nut-allergic people were expecting NOT to have a reaction, they didn't - even if they ingested the allergen. Their brains told the immune system ''everything is clear'', so to speak. This is proof that the brain has direct control over allergic reactions and the immune system.\n\nIn the context of the question, let's say the pill is just sugar, but the person is told it's a new drug that cures any allergy, and their brain becomes convinced the pill will cure their allergy.",

The lactose intolerance breath test uses chemistry to determine whether lactose was properly broken down or not, but that's the only one I know of.\n\nMy understanding is that there are tons of chemical reactions that drive digestion and nutrient absorption. I would assume that a sampling of both the types and frequencies of intestinal bacteria, along with the chemical composition of the individual's stomach acid, could provide predictive data on what the individual can and cannot eat.\n\nWhy is this not part of the field of gastroenterology? Is there research that has indicated this data would not be predictive?\n\nThe \"food sensitivity tests\" that are on the market measure antibody (immune system) responses to certain foods. Most gastroenterologists do not use these tests to inform treatment, and they aren't covered by insurance. I'm not asking about these. I'm asking about the lack of inquiry on / wide application of the specific chemical reactions that do or do not take place in healthy/ dysfunctional digestive systems.\n\nThank you!",

I've had several surgeries but nothing helped, I have multiple co morbidities including heart problems because of the EDS. I just keep getting worse and I'm on so many medications I lose count.\n\nI've read about cancer, diabetes, blindness, and allergies being cured through the placebo effect, so why not genetic diseases?\n\nA terminally ill man with cancer was cured via the placebo effect. He was given sugar pills, but was told by scientists that they were anti cancer breakthrough pills. His tumor actually disappeared. In another study, patients with severe, life threatening allergies to nuts were hypnotized into believing they were not allergic. They were then given a powder which contained nuts. None of them had an allergic reaction, simply because they believed they were not allergic.\n\nI don't understand why the placebo effect isn't used to cure people. It's amazing what the brain can do. If believing you're not allergic can re wire your immune system, and believing you've taken an anti-cancer pill causes cancer cells to selectively die off, why can't it make EDS mutations vanish because a person believed they would?\n\nThe more I learn about the human brain, the more convinced I am that it's bordering on supernatural. It's stupid that more people aren't talking about this!\n\nEven without removing the gene defect, couldn't the placebo effect also convince the body to produce normal collagen, rather than defective EDS collagen?\n\nWouldn't it be much cheaper for scientists/doctors to just lie and say that a pill alters DNA when really it's just sugar? Wouldn't it save costs of having to research and develop complicated compounds?\n\nIf believing you will be cured actually cures you of a physical disease, why aren't scientists exploiting the hell out of that?",

If I wanted to capture this kind of data in a way that would be valuable for analysis later, what kinds of things do I need to learn about?\n\nI work as a software developer, but my math skills are quite poor at the moment.

Unfortunately traditional higher education just isn't an option for me, but books, and websites, and videos work well for me.\n\nI'm not out to change the world with any groundbreaking discoveries, but I think learning a little more about how to experiment, measure outcomes, and evaluating my original hypothesis against data would be valuable to me as a life long skill.
