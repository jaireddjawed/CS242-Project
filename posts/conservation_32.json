        "text": "There are 5,000 black rhinoceros left on Earth; there are 300 million guns in the United States.  Put another way, the US contains one gun for every person; the world contains one black rhino for every 1.5 million people.  \n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nI take the same bus through midtown Manhattan to work every morning.  \n\nEvery day, as we advance up Madison Avenue, the same rage hits me. \n\nThere is a bus stop at 63rd Street, right across the street from the Beretta Gallery.  Yes, this is Beretta like the gun.  The centuries-old European firearm company has a showroom on the Upper East Side, a full three-story brownstone wedged comfortably between De Beers jewelry and designer Etro USA.  \n\nAt first glance, I found it bizarre to see the storefront at all.  I had to google the name just to make sure it was the same Beretta that makes all those famous shotguns; it is.  (And one of those shotguns retails for $106,000.)  But after a few days of stopping in front of the store for a few minutes each morning, I started to get a closer look at the window display that Beretta has chosen to use.\n\nThe whole store is made to feel like an exclusive European hunting lodge, with antlers and stuffed ducks and dark wood paneling covering the walls. \n This, in itself, is confusing and compelling – why does a company which prides itself on a long history of sophistication and wealth need to appeal to duck hunting, which in the days of Duck Dynasty is often considered the lowest common denominator? \n \nBut that train of thought immediately crashed when I saw the [window display ](http://www.beretta.com/assets/2/19/GalleryMainDimensionId/ext01nyc1.jpg).\n\nMeant to portray a safari vibe, the upper window shows two mannequins, each dressed in shades of tan with hunting jackets and scarves and, it appears from a distance, holsters.  They are standing next to a large steamer trunk and a table of old books, as if they were in their nineteenth-century hut in the thick of Zaire.  \n\nAnd right behind them is the mounted head of a black rhino.\nWhile I’m sure it isn’t real (though given the reality of the other stuffed and mounted “decorations” in the store, this may be giving Beretta too much credit), it is life-size and very, very realistic.  It is positioned next to this proud couple, as if they were showing off their latest kill; it is grotesque. \n\nEvery time I see this scene and think about the fact that it is meant to appeal to customers, to make them want to enter the Gallery, I am struck with the same wave of disgust I felt the first time I noticed it.\n\nIt is one thing to appeal to hunters.  After all, Beretta is the world leader in luxury shotguns – it isn’t like they’ve made their riches off of assault weapons and revolvers.  As much as I am personally appalled by the concept of hunting, I understand that it is a popular sport and a common hobby.  And to remind American shoppers that hunting can be a bourgeois pastime is a perfectly reasonable marketing strategy.\n\nBut there is a huge – massive – difference between hunting and poaching.\n \nSince 2008, poachers have killed at least 6,000 African rhinos , 30% of the African elephant population , and half of the leopards which die annually .  And according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this is a rapid escalation, unprecedented by decades of poorly enforced anti-poaching laws. \n\nIf the current rate of poaching continues, rhinos (all 5 remaining species) could become entirely extinct by 2026.   A massive beast, the pinnacle of brute force, will have been completely obliterated by mankind.  Human beings should be ashamed of, not encouraged, by that fact.  \nThe illegal rhino horn market is not an admirable capitalist structure, no matter how you look at it, it just isn’t something to be glorified.\nBut that’s exactly what Beretta is doing.  And why?  Well, to sell the exact guns which poachers use. \n\nBeretta is using the corpse of an endangered animal to attract people to their store.  This scene has been in the window for years, it clearly isn’t deterring customers from spending the kind of money that Beretta shoppers spend.  If anything, it is appealing to some psychological factor for which a poached creature is attractive.\n\nIt is common knowledge among merchandisers and marketing companies that window displays are meant to appeal to a target customer’s imagination.  One study shows that there is a direct correlation between the “context setting of a window display” and the “effect on consumer’s … arousal response.”    Ironically, the final conclusion of the study was that “fashionable products should brighten themselves by exploiting props” in order to attract customers into the store. \n\nOne can only assume that Beretta would not continue to exist after 500 years if it didn’t understand the concept of appealing to its customers.  This window display was intentional.  At least at first, Beretta had reason to believe that the image of two people dressed in privileged European safari attire, proudly displaying their murder of an endangered animal would attract Upper East Side customers into their Gallery.  And evidently, it did. \n\nThis company is proudly proclaiming “come shop at Beretta, where the market is black and the rhinos are blacker.”  They are, in essence, endorsing poachers everywhere.  Which, as a gun company, is to suggest that the product they are trying to sell should be used this way.  They actually want the typical Upper East Side residents – a Wall Street broker and his trophy wife, probably – to walk past the store, see this slain beast, and think “gee, wouldn’t it be glorious if mine were the head on that mannequin?  I would look so good in that vest, and the ladies’ holster is just darling.  And wouldn’t it be the ultimate taste of luxury to be able to travel thousands of miles in order to shoot large game for sport?  I wish I could be in that display.  I should buy a Beretta.” \n\nUsing the concept of poaching to appeal to people’s interests and imaginations is obscene.  But while we cannot change what interests people – rich white people will be taking glamorous hunting trips until the day there is nothing left to kill – there is no reason for this to be the tactic used to prove how sophisticated a company is.  Even if the store were owned by a luggage company, or a jeweler, this kind of display would be tasteless and offensive.  But for it to be displayed by the manufacturer of the weapon used to destroy the endangered wildlife it brags about killing is absolutely disgusting, and cannot continue.\n\n\n\n",
