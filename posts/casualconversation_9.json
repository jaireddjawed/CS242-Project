He was very thoughtful and would do things that no one has done for me. The way I was let go was understandable (the owner and his sister teamed up, not my boss), but it bothered me at the time bc I was going through a lot. I still remember the voicemail my boss left me saying that I had been laid off and he sounded like he was going to cry. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm doing great in my life and can‚Äôt help but think of him from time to time. I want to reach out and just see how he‚Äôs doing but he hasn‚Äôt messaged me since I was let go (it‚Äôs been about a year). \n\nDo I just move on and accept that we no longer are in each others lives? Or do you think maybe he feels bad for what happened and that‚Äôs why he hasn‚Äôt reached out? \n\nWhat do you guys think? I miss him a lot and he always told me he‚Äôd be at my graduation when that day comes and that always stuck with me. Sad to see it‚Äôs all gone now. What should I do? Please give me a better insight on this. Thank you!!!",

For example you might have black shoes, trousers, blazer with a white shirt and gray waistcoat. Paired with this, a red tie and pocket handkerchief. The tie is the centrepiece of the suit, so that's where the colour. Which draws our attention to the tie and makes it pop. \n\nAnother example is a living room where the paintwork, flooring, furniture is all black, white and gray. But you might have hand drawn roses on the feature wall, rose coloured cushions on the sofa and a vase of roses on the coffee table. The minimal use of pink makes these decorations more eye catching. The feature wall stands out more because it's one of the only sources of colour. \n\nTl;dr it's the absence of colour to make colour pop.",

I have enough things in my head as it is.\n\nI've noticed, especially for old friends, they reply really late.. I dont mind that. No.. wait I actually do. \n\nI get it, its not urgent. Its just a bunch of \"howre yous\" and inconsequential surface level interactions. However, I think for me the long periods in between makes me anxious. I dont know why but it just does. It feels like waiting for toasts to be ready. Its like, \"can we just get it over with?\" I just want finish this and do something else. \n\nThe thing is, should I wait the same amount of time before texting back? Like if they took a day to reply, should I do the same? ..it just seems like a lot of work to keep score of..\n\nAnd i dont know if I should actually be concerned about the fact that Im the only one texting back sooner?

        "text": "Fish, my cat, is my best friend. \n\nOne night my roommates accidentally let him out, and he was gone for 9 days in the middle of a terrible winter. It got down to -10 degrees real temperature many nights that he was missing. I never gave up hope, and spent every second of my free time looking for him or making posters by hand because we didn‚Äôt have a printer and were too poor to get posters made. On day 9 I began accept the reality that we may have separated forever. I had one friend over and it was very late into the night approaching morning, maybe 3-4am. I was smoking a joint with him while talking about life and mortality, as he was helping me cope with the loss of my homie when I started to get a tummy ache. \n\nThis tummy ache was ignorable at first, but ramped up slowly to where in about 10 minutes I couldn‚Äôt ignore it or pretend I was okay. I slowly move to the ground to curl up in the fetal position because it hurt so bad, and I didn‚Äôt know anything that could have cause it or alleviate it. I even thought I might be having a heart attack because I‚Äôve heard of stomach aches being an early warning sign, and this was unlike anything I‚Äôve felt before. The only thing I can think of that might help is some fresh air, so I stumble to the front door‚Ä¶\n\nAnd there is a cat, not my cat, but a black cat just like mine, but way smaller‚Ä¶. I say ‚Äúfish?‚Äù And he takes a few steps back afraid.. I say his name again and bend down way too fast and spook him away, but i as calmly as possible eventually chase him to the side of the house, and coax him into arms reach and snag him up, and bring him inside. It was my cat, he was half of his original weight, missing a chunk of his ear(from frostbite or a battle I‚Äôm not sure) smelled like garbage and Doritos but it was him‚Ä¶ \n\nHe called me outside, my stomach ache was gone after he was home for about 10 minutes. He slept for almost a week straight but he is a happy healthy old man now. I‚Äôve never been very spiritual, but my bond with him makes me believe that magic does exist. \n\nI just needed to tell someone about my story, and I‚Äôd love to hear about your magical friends(: thank you for reading and much love .\n\n\nTL:DR extreme tummy ache made me seek fresh air and find my missing cat waiting for me. What magical bonds do you have with your animal?",

My clothes fit better, and I started taking better care of my skin. I also started doing dance classes to learn a new skill. In addition I really wanted to try harder in dating and for the start I got rejected a lot but I was fine with it, I got back up and gave myself a pat on the back for trying. \n\nI feel like recently though I tried pursuing one girl and I got the vibe she was not interested. Kinda sad about it but I can‚Äôt do anything. I think that Friday a few weeks ago, I went to a dance social. I could‚Äôve asked our so many girls but I had a lot of work to do over the weekend and I didn‚Äôt want ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù. I did get through the weekend well though. It‚Äôs been like two weeks since and only now I‚Äôve been beating myself up over not getting any numbers. There was also one girl who may have had a little interest in me but I fumbled by not making a move and I haven‚Äôt seen her since. My self defeating thoughts are rising too. A lot of girls who rejected me said they had a bf, and it just makes me feel like every girl I fancy has one so there‚Äôs no point in trying.\n\nI‚Äôve also been incredibly stressed out with school since several assignments and midterms have been hitting me back to back. I‚Äôve been so exhausted and sometimes I feel like my efforts are for nothing. Sometimes I don‚Äôt get the grades I want and it makes me hate myself. I‚Äôm a STEM major and my classes are absolutely battering me, but at least spring break is coming.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how to get my confidence back. I don‚Äôt fear rejection a ton but what I mainly fear is coming off as a creep. To my knowledge I don‚Äôt exhibit such behavior but I have accidentally been too much in the past. Any suggestions?",

        "text": "I am super bored so I am here to discuss greek yogurt.\n\nI usually have 1-2 cups of Chobani or Dannon greek yogurt per day and yesterday I went and stocked up (50 cups) because they were on a big sale and i just think its funny an entire fridge of my shelf is packed with yogurt üòÇ I know I‚Äôll eat them all before expiration so no worries there. My bf doesn‚Äôt like yogurt either so it‚Äôs all for me.\n\nSo I am here to spread my yogurt obsession with you all online and finally admit my addiction üòÇ Any foods you guys love and keep stocked up on like this?",
