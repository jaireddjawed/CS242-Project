I think this theme is developed by several motifs. My question is (and this will require familiarity with the book), could the character of Assef be viewed as a motif? He first appears as Amir and Hassan's childhood tormentor when he rapes Hassan, and then reappears in the same role when adult Amir is trying to rescue Sohrab. Also, Assef seems a very \"flat\" character - he does not really change from one appearance to the other. He is the same oppressive, abusive, antagonistic force; the only thing that changes is that Amir finds the courage to stand up to him the second time. Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding motifs?",

When they were in the middle of the jungle, the weather changed  suddenly and a storm descended on them. They took shelter in a cave. \n\nThey waited and waited. The storm lasted for three days.\n\nWhen the weather came back to the normal, one man from the group got up and went to check the condition outside. \nAfter sometime, he came back. \"What did you see?\" asked the elderly scholar of the group.\n\"The storm has passed, but it has done heavy damage. The bridge on the river, which we have to cross to go to next town, has broken. We can't proceed.\" replied the man.\nA second man got up. “Let me check again if we can go back to our hometown.\" Saying this the second man left the cave.\n\nAfter a while, he came back, dejected. “No, we can't go back. A giant tree has fallen in our path back home.\" Said the second man.\nThe third man, who was sitting in the corner silently so far, got up.\n\"Where are you going?\" Asked the first man.\n\"To see for myself\" replied the third man.\n\"Go and see. But we all know there is a problem, and we are stuck here.\" said second man.\nThe third man didn't reply. He just walked out.\nHe came back after a long time.\n\n\"What were you doing for so long? What did you see?\" Asked the elderly scholar.\n“First, I saw the broken bridge. Then I went to see the fallen tree\" the third man replied.\n“What was the point? We all know the problem. Neither can we cross the bridge, nor can we go back. We are stuck here for eternity.\" the second man shouted.\n“When I saw the fallen tree, I got an idea. I took out a big branch of the tree and carried it to bridge. I then used the branch to fix the broken bridge. Now we can can cross the river to the next town.\" Explained the third man.\n\"Such a strange thing! Sometimes, our problems are the solutions themselves. But while everybody can see the problems, very few can put them together into a solution”  mumbled the elderly scholar to himself. \nStory By Shon Mehta",

We welcome questions regarding the ins-and-outs of doing literary research, the field at large, and the types of careers available to those with scholarly literary training. \n\nQuestions might fall under these categories:\n\n- How to do research in a specialized library\n\n- How to publish articles or books\n\n- How to present research to the public (seminars, colloquia, conferences, etc.)\n\n- How to situate oneself in a scholarly tradition\n\n- Keeping abreast of current research\n\n- How to write a thesis or a dissertation\n\n- The academic job market, alt-ac jobs\n\nOr, of course, you are welcome to ask particular, specific questions addressed to one or more of our distinguished panelists:\n\n/u/MilsonBartleby:\n\nI have a BA in English Literature, an MA in English and American Literature, and I am in the very final stages of a PhD. I'm also from the UK so may be able to give some perspective on institutional differences between the US and UK. My specialism is in twentieth century literature and specifically literary modernism. I look at the role of the footnote in TS Eliot, Marianne Moore, David Jones, Charles Olson, Vladimir Nabokov, and David Foster Wallace.\n\n/u/cuchlann:\n\nI received my Ph.D. in literature in August 2013 and my MFA in creative writing in May 2009. I teach comparative humanities as an adjunct, and have since August of last year. While still a student I taught freshman composition and sophomore literature. In between I catalogued and digitally archived books and ephemera for a private donor to a university library.\n\nMy first published article was on a 20th century Polish SF author, and my second (forthcoming) on a 19th-20th century British horror/fantasy author. My research interests, are, appropriately enough, SF/F/Horror, evolutionary theory in literature, occultism, and video game narrative.\n\n/u/Dispositio:\n\nI'm an Associate Professor of English at the University of Toronto, and the chair of the Department of English and Drama on the Mississauga campus. My research these days is mostly in theatre history and contemporary performance, but I'm also a book historian and used to do a lot of work on law and literature; most of my work is focused on early modern England (often Shakespeare) and on modern responses/interpretations/stagings of older plays.\nI have a BA in English from Oxford and a PhD in English from Harvard; before coming to Toronto I was an Assistant Professor for a year at Miami University (in Ohio). I've published a monograph, Theatre and Testimony in Shakespeare's England (Cambridge 2012), and have co-edited a collection of essays, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583-1603 (Ashgate 2009); you can find a full list of my publications here: https://utoronto.academia.edu/HolgerSyme\n\n/u/savdec449:\n\nI'm a PhD student in the US, and my work focuses on the ways in which avant-garde poetics around the middle of the 20th century depend upon and engage discourses of labor and class, and also marxist theory that deals with these issues. I'd be happy to field questions, since I'm at the beginning of my program, from the perspective of someone towards the beginning of the academic timeline (applications, engaging current research beyond the classroom, etc).\n\n/u/j_la:\n\nI hold a BA and MA in literature from Canadian universities and am working on my PhD at an American university. \n\nI plan to write about radio in Irish and British literature, looking at authors like Denis Johnston, Elizabeth Bowen, Louis MacNeice, Samuel Beckett, Virginia Woolf etc. I try to strike a balance between materially-minded theory (focusing on technologies of studio production and the spatial considerations they engender) and strains of media theory that grow out of post-structural thinking (e.g. Kittler).\n\n/u/illu45:\n\nI'm a PhD student at a large North American university, hoping to be ABD this fall. My 'field' is primarily British modernism, with a focus on British society and fiction around the turn of the 20th century. As my flair suggests, I've done a fair bit of work on Woolf, including presenting at a few IVWS conferences. I also have an interest in genetic criticism.\n\n/u/PBuchanan:\n\nI have a BA (2006) in English and Mathematics from the University of Kansas and an MA (2007) and PhD (2013) in Medieval Studies from the University of Toronto. My dissertation was a series of phenomenological readings of Latin and Old English texts exploring how sensory perception affects adaptation and translation in poetry. After my Ph.D. I spent a year tutoring high school students in Michigan and then last year I got a job as Assistant Professor of English at New Mexico Highlands University, a small school located in Las Vegas, NM, about an hour east of Santa Fe.\nMy main research interests are in Latin and Old English literature, especially poetry and hagiography, but I'm also interested in Middle English literature, manuscript studies, Old Norse, literary theory, modern poetry, and historical linguistics. \n\nMy current position is primarily devoted to teaching linguistics courses for the English department, including History of the English Language, Modern Grammar, Sociolinguistics, and Stylistics, though I do manage to squeeze some medieval literature in as well.\n\n/u/coree:\n\nI am a PhD student at an American university, about to go on the job market. My dissertation looks at the literature produced during the Siege of Paris (1870-1871) at the end of the Franco-Prussian War, and specifically at new conceptions of nationalism and citizenship as articulated in that literature. In general, my work bridges the gap between history and literary studies, usually falling under the broad category of \"cultural history.\" Otherwise, I write and teach about the French novel in the 19th and 20th centuries, real estate and other nefarious financial speculations during the French 19th century, and the relationship between gender and urban space. I study authors we know and love (or hate), such as Zola, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant, and Sand, but also work extensively in the archives, digging up authors and texts that have long been forgotten but that deserve another chance.\n\n/u/amishius:\n\nMFA in poetry from Brown, starting a PhD in English/Creative Writing and hoping to focus on poetics in the public sphere, poetry as a counterpublic and other issues surrounding contemporary poetics in the United States and (increasingly) abroad.\n\n/u/ferinona:\n\nI'd love to participate. I have a PhD in literature (2012) and a BA in Literature and Comparative Literature (2008). I did 18-century literature for my thesis but my interest in literature is much wider. I have a strong interest in Writing Studies and I have a couple of blogs that [discuss literature](http://www.franciscnona1.blogspot.com/) and [writing](http://www.the021.blogspot.com/). I have taught undergraduate courses, mostly in the field of Writing Studies.",

Today I'd like to extend a similar invitation to this wonderful sub.\n\nOver two years ago, I created /r/OldEnglish to help me get declensions to stick in my head. I've seen that sub grow to almost 1000 readers, many of whom I have seen give the most caring and enthusiastic advice to visitors while also making contributions to the sub letting me see things that I never would have guessed existed otherwise. That is my goal for /r/Chaucer - to be a completely open forum for anyone and everyone interested in the Middle English period to share resources, ask questions, and just see what other like-minded scholars, student, historians, and lovers of poetry have to contribute. \n\nSince I know many of us here are educators and graduate students, I wanted to reach out specifically to this sub. It is my hope that you will take a quick look around /r/Chaucer if nothing else, maybe laugh at the user flair, and, if you like it, subscribe so you can stick around. If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, problems, or concerns about it, please do feel free to let me know either here or in a message - I'm really excited to see the enthusiasm Chaucer's reddit resurrection has garnered so far, and I'm looking forward to making it into a genuine community with something for everyone. \n\nThanks, \n\n-Rizzpooch\n\n",

I know that Carmichael's is not the most glamorous or popular nor probably the most scholarly, but it was by far the most natural and engrossing. P&amp;V translated some line as \"she aimed to palliate him\" while Carmichael would write that as \"she tried to make him feel more comfortable\". He also translates in such a way that the writing is extremely sensitive to the characters, which has been my favorite aspect of reading Anna Karenina.\n\nUnfortunately, Carmichael never did a translation of War and Peace, and those I have been able to read bits of so far have not been quite the same level of naturalness to them that I had hoped for. The closest I've found so far seems to be Louise &amp; Aylmer Maude's translation, but they have some awkward turns of phrase in there and the characters feel somewhat wooden in their dialogue. I may just need to keep reading, but I would love to hear what ALS's resources are. I searched in r/literature and r/ALS but found no previous questions about this.\n\nThanks very much.",

At first I didn't really like the piece but upon reading it again, more closely and really picking it apart I started to recognize and appreciate all the nuance.  \n\nI'm not asking anyone to do my homework for me, it's pretty cut and dried. A character actually says another character needs \"a clean, well-lighted place\" along with numerous references to Hemingway, in addition to thus the theme of fear and nothingness is palpable. Since it's such a short essay I think I need to focus more on the nihilist aspect rather than drawing comparisons between the two stories.\n\nIt's an online course so I have no one else to discuss the reading with (except the prof but she hasn't emailed me back). I was just interested in what others think of it.  \n\nA couple talking points:  \n\n* Despite being her heroine do you think deep down Jane fears ultimately becoming Jean Rhys, the bad alcoholic?  \n\n* What do you make of the ending? Why does she skip out on the boat ride? I think she's avoiding a relationship with Ned but it seems deliberately unclear, like much of the author's other short stories.  \n\n* What do you think the icebergs ultimately represent to Jane?!

By recent I mean the past twenty years or so, as I'm familiar with Derrida, Lacan, Foucault, etc. It could be general literary theory, but I focus on Renaissance Lit (Especially Milton &amp; Spenser), so anything along those lines that deals with that time period and authors would be great as well.\nThanks.\n",

I have a serious interest in the topic, but I've just started researching and I could use some guidance.\n\nI've found that, as is the case with any problem present in Shakespeare's works, free will is presented from multiple, opposite perspectives. Just as an example, the way King Lear's own decision sets off a series of events that sees him striped of everything but his own humanity might indicate an example of free will, but this is relativized by the way the following events seem to steamroll over him, or by how other innocent characters are dragged to similar destinies. Destiny vs. free will seems present in every tragedy, if not every play, Shakespeare ever wrote. I was also interested in how, after all his misfortunes, Lear seems to find freedom in insanity, imitating, in a way, the fool's speech (the only character who, free of any formal ties to social order, seems absolutely free —in his speech— in the play). \n\nThis is just a bunch of poorly ordered and phrased impressions, I don't mean to put King Lear in particular in discussion (I find that free will is present as a problem, in some way, in every one of Shakespeare's works I've read, even in his Sonnets, in the way the Poet battles Time / Death through poetry), but Shakespeare's huge work as a whole. I'll be grateful for any help I might receive.",

Brecht’s reason for disallowing the audience to form an emotional connections to the play and actors is to make the messages more accessible and realistic. This is done by showing the instruments of theater, actors breaking the fourth wall, and anything that makes the play seem more like an act of theater rather than an imaginary chunk of the real world. In others words Brecht’s alienation effect is an effort to make the whole idea of seeing a play less about being transported to a experience and more about understanding why something was created; to have the audience remain objective.

However, I argue that an engaging and “true” alienated experience in which the audience isn’t influenced by emotions and opinions can be achieved without striping the stage of all things magical. That the audience can remain objective and form no connections with the actors while still being transported to the scene of the play. In other words, the stage need not be bare for the audience to be non-emotionally engaged. As well as that, I would also like to explore what detrimental or positive effects these magical things can have on the quality of the work.

I believe it belongs to some sort of esoteric Colombian folklore, but I can't find a definitive image of it anywhere.",

In fact, I've read some of his works. But I still have a hard time identifying and fully grasping his concept of *surrealist automatism*. If you respond, thanks, your time was appreciated. ",

I was wondering if there was information on Proust's influence in other countries (especially the larger middle east) via translations of his works? In particular, I have recently read a book called, A Mind At Peace by Turkish author Tanipar. It seemed likely, and wikipedia claims so, that this author had both read and was influenced by Proust (amoung others). I am sure Proust's works were a great influence to many authors, and I would like to research this avenue. When did those translations reach the other country? How heavily did Proust's works influence that country's 'modernist literature' movement/blossoming? If and How did his work influence or possibly change the narrative structure and literary theories of said country's literature?\n\nAnyone have any thoughts? Thanks !!\n",

I really just need to hear from other people who aren't in my head what they think is interesting. The stranger the better, maybe. Incest? Paedophilia? Thanks everyone! ",

The actual event will probably last for a few days, and we're looking to kick it off sometime in mid-August.\n\nThe AMA will focus on the ins-and-outs of doing literary research, the field at large, and the types of careers available to those with scholarly literary training. Ideally, we're looking to fill the gaps in the types of questions we normally get on this sub, making it at once more personal and more general. \n\nQuestions might fall under these categories:\n\n- How to do research in a specialized library\n\n- How to publish articles or books\n\n- How to present research to the public (seminars, colloquia, conferences, etc.)\n\n- How to situate oneself in a scholarly tradition\n\n- Keeping abreast of current research\n\n- How to write a thesis or a dissertation\n\n- The academic job market, alt-ac jobs\n\nAnd of course:\n\n - Individual questions about your research based on your biography. \n\nAs always, you would not be required to give your name or your university affiliation, but ideally we'd like for participants to give a short biography that includes past, current, and upcoming projects. You do not have to be currently enrolled at a university, teaching, or even employed to participate, but this will be restricted to those with experience in doing literary research. \n\nWe'd also love for feedback about the design and expectations for the AMA from potential participants or inquirers, so let's use this also as a space to come up with an AMA that best suits the interests of the sub.",
