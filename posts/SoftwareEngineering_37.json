        "text": "Hi,\n\nHaving worked with Stripe/FB api's, I love how clear and concise their error messages are. For each use case, they specify the class of the exception and its message.\n\nWhile writing my own API, I would like to achieve something similar. A friend said that we can achieve this by defining a list of static error codes and corresponding messages. All exceptions thrown must use one of these error codes, which will then be shown to the end user. \n\nThis ensures that consumers get properly error messages and that we don't leak debugging data unintentionally (the full stack trace of the exception will be logged separately).\n\nHowever, I am concerned that this will limit our flexibility. not allowing over-rides, will force developers to create new error codes for minor variations (eg: User email not found vs user email not supplied, recipe not found vs recipe deleted etc). This also prevents us from sending request details in the error response (Eg: User 'abc' not found etc).\n\nWhat is a good architecture to follow for such a use case? We would like to keep a small set of possible error codes and keep messages as consistent as possible. but don't want to mandate creation of new exceptions/error codes for slightly different cases.",

I am familiar with various methods for classification, regression, clustering etc... but I am not familiar with how to deploy these methods at scale.\n\nI was very impressed by what the software engineers were doing (they were involved in developing a natural language processing framework/pipeline) but I soon realized we were speaking two different languages. \n\nTheir natural language processing framework is essentially a collection of open source APIs that, together, do whatever they want it to do. They seemed to have very little understanding of what the APIs or libraries they were using were actually doing (i.e. k-means clustering using euclidean distance, what an n-gram is, what is cosine similarity, etc...) However they seemed to have an excellent understanding of what each API service did and how they could use that in their pipeline. This is something I do not understand at all. I feel like I lack of a big picture understanding of how each piece fits together.\n\nAre there any resources I could go to that might explain this at a high level? How software engineers can use all these open source APIs to develop a product and how it all fits together?",

        "text": "Hey guys! I had a question concerning the path I want to take as an incoming college freshman. My goal after college is to become a software engineer and I am going to enter college in the fall. I’m currently enrolled in a Bachelors of science program in Computer Programming and Information Systems. [Here](http://www.farmingdale.edu/academics/curriculum/bs-computer-programming-and-information-systems.shtml) is the information on the program along with its curriculum to the side. They don’t offer a computer science nor a software engineering major at this college. So this is where my question comes in. Could I still become a Software Engineer with a bachelors degree in this program? Are there any courses I should take as electives that are essential to me becoming a software engineer? Should I take an applied mathematics minor to complement this program (Calc I, II, III, linear algebra, differential equations, and discrete mathematics)? Would it be better to transfer to another school with a computer science degree if this program can’t lead me to a career as a software engineer? And finally, could I still become a software engineer if I graduate with a bachelors in this program and later get a masters degree in software engineering? I would appreciate any response that could provide me with the most information to my situation.",

        "text": "Hello and thanks in advance for those who read the longish post. I am trying to provide as much relevant info as possible.\n\nI have a question and wanted to get some opinions about a logical career path.\n\nI am currently a Security Analyst, however the title of my job is a bit deceiving, as my actual job description is as part of a certifying body for Health IT. I test EHR software systems to make sure they meet the various government standards so the software can be certified. This means reviewing functionality, putting the software through test tools, some simple code review (XML), making sure the software meets security standards (has proper audit logs, proper authentication, proper hashing algorithms for message digests) and a good deal of documentation review (usability testing review, QMS review, accessibility standards review). The most difficult part of my job has been reading hundreds of pages of government documents and understanding exactly what is required for each unique system.\n\nI am currently getting a Masters of Science in Software Development. The program does have some focus on code, but also looks at high level stuff such as Systems Analysis, Agile Practices, Data Structures/Algorithms, and Software Design. I am trying to decide the next best step. I am looking at Software Development jobs, but I don't have any work experience actually building and coding systems, outside of school projects which are relatively simple. I would say I am intermediate at Python and beginner at C. By the end of the masters program I should be intermediate at Java.\n\nI am concerned that I don't have the required real world experience for anything but a junior level role, but the Masters Degree may make it seem like I am over qualified for a junior role, and that I will require too much money. And I am in fact looking for my next position to pay well (60-80k). My current role pays only around 40k.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? Are there software testing positions that are similar to my position that would be a bridge to more of the software engineering side that would be logical? What are some other types of positions I should keep in mind? I am just trying to do the best thing for my family. I am 31 and I have a wife and 8 month old son.\n\nThanks for your advice!",

I have a law degree, and I was heading towards a career in academic research before finally coming to the realisation that it wasn't for me.\n\nMy university offers a software engineering bachelors (which I was originally enrolled in), but the curriculum is very tightly structured, and I want to dig into tertiary maths while I have the opportunity. So I basically exchanged the four-year SE program for overlapping three-year CS and maths degrees, which should end up taking about the same amount of time with a bit of overloading.\n\nI'm happy with the decision, and I thought very carefully about it before committing, but I was also looking forward to learning the systemic and process-type skills that you get from a real engineering degree. What would be a good way to develop and demonstrate this side of things under my own steam? Is there a good way to do this in my personal projects? I imagine a lot of the project management stuff you'd do in SE is more tailored to larger-scale or team development, but I'm keen to get as much of a handle on it as I can, and start early (well, \"early\").\n\nIf it's useful for whatever reason, here are the degree structures for the [B.Comp.Sci. \\(Adv.\\)](http://calendar.adelaide.edu.au/aprcw/2017/bcmsa_bcmpscadv) and the [B.Eng.

I am super nervous because it is my dream job. Project management. I recently enrolled in an AS in software dev but haven't started. I don't know enough about any of this. I don't know jack about software dev yet. \n\nWhat will make me bring this home? ",

        "text": "I'm in my mid-30s and looking to career change into software engineering. My background is econ/math with jobs in finance/consulting doing a lot of work with languages like SAS/R/SQL. \n\nIn my earlier days, I was a tinkerer so have informal experience with website development (LAMP), took C++ in HS, and currently learning Python. I've always been a very good programmer, but never pursued the tech field besides a 1.5 year stint doing automated test development.\n\nMy ideal job would be data scientist, but I don't think I have a very good shot at that role unless I either get another master's degree (CS or Stats) or maybe just prove my CS skills with software dev experience. That's what has me now targeting software dev jobs.\n\nCurrently, I'm learning Algorithms on Coursera and will be taking a C++ and DS/Algs course from Harvard Extension this fall. I'm not sure this coursework will necessarily help me get a job, though, so I'm looking for something practical.\n\nPerhaps Android Development? Where would you recommend someone without much formal experience look to get their foot in the door? ",

        "text": "In my entire career programming (over 12 years) one thing I've never done well is project management.\n\nProgramming is the easy part. The hard part for me is taking documentation/specs etc and turning them into a project before any code is written. That to me is incredibly complex. I'm a solo developer and have never felt the need to learn.\n\nDon't get me wrong I can read them just fine, and implement whatever task it is I've been given. I just can't do the project management myself. I'd love to have the skills to do this.\n\nAre there any good books, or recourses where I can learn project management.\n\nI've recently joined TopCoder, and after taking a look around I feel I'm not going to be able to commit to anything unless I can improve my skills in the areas I lack.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.",
