        "text": "For years now I've been interested in learning about wildlife conservation and today I want to take the next step and start reading about conversation. I know this likely spans many categories and methodologies likely vary widely depending on the animal; however, are there any books on conservation methodologies? I'm particularly interested in cheetahs but I really want to learn generally as well. \n\nAny links, videos and podcasts that would be helpful are appreciated too!\n\nThanks in advance!",
