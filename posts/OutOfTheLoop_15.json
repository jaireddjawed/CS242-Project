I almost never hear “folks” in any other context. I’m wondering why that is, considering “people” is gender neutral so there shouldn’t be a gendering issue here, or maybe I’m missing something. \nI was listening to a radio show where a guest was talking about the trans community and the host asked a question about “trans people” and the guest made a point of saying “folk” in the response, appearing to correct the host. \nHere’s an example where “folks” has been used multiple times throughout the text [link](https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/trans-101)",
