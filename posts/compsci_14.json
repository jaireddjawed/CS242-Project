If someone were to break down how this works and what each bus is for, I'd greatly appreciate it.  \n\n\nThings in the diagram that confuse me (aside from the two aforementioned questions):  \n\\- What is the rm field at the top left for?  \n\\- What's with the 107 bit bus from the shift alignment subunit to the 3:2 compressor row?  \n\\- What's \"effective\\_subtract\"?  \n\\- What does the \"s\" in \"tentative\\_s\" stand for? Is it some sort of subnormal flag predictor?  \n\\- Why is the output of the normalization shift subunit a 13-bit and 54-bit bus?  \n\n\nAlternatively, if someone could point me to a resource that would explain floating point units in enough depth for me to get a proper understanding of what's going on here, I'd greatly appreciate it.  \n\n\nThank you.",

I got my undergrad in Computer Science and currently pursuing my masters in computer science, focus Big Data and AI. This post is regarding my master thesis topic.\n\nI must write a proposal, get it accepted, get registered this month for my thesis. For various reasons, I still do not have a topic in hand and time is extremely scarce right now. I am interested in ML and AI in the field of music, image classification, etc.\n\nOn hearing this, people respond with “Research and find something you’ll like doing or interested in” or “Take some time off to figure out what do you want to work in” or “If you don’t get a topic you like working on, you’ll be miserable”\n\nI appreciate this but at this moment, given all the circumstances, I NEED to finish my thesis this semester and I need to do it now. I am okay with working on something I do not like or might make me miserable. What I bring in at this moment is knowledge and readiness to slog my ass off to finish the work. I would prefer working with a company as that will allow me to work on the company project and at the same time, gain some working experience.\n\nI have been applying through links and websites, but the process is taking too long, and time is of utmost importance to me right now. I will be happy to share my resume, show sample codes of my work, etc to people who would want to see it. I am hoping to connect to people who will give me a direction to work in or refer me to someone who could give me a way out of this thesis situation.\n\nSince I am posting this, asking for a very particular help/suggestion, you do not have to respond to this if it is not helpful as of now. I do not mean to be rude here to anyone, but on seeing this people just downvote it because, I do not know, maybe they get offended, or they just do not like it.\n\nPlease don’t do it. I need the post to have a wider reach so that I have a chance of getting help and it is easy to comment something mean or make my post invisible sitting comfortably somewhere behind a screen. \n\nAt this point, a lot of money and time went behind my education. I know the moral grounds of it and that is why, my ONLY priority right now is finishing it on time, and I am ready to give it my all. I will continue applying to companies and doing my own research.\n\nReddit can do wonders when times look bleak and I’m really hoping for a godsend help right now.\n\nThank you for reading this and if you read the entire thing, just drop an upvote so that it reaches more audience.",

I don’t mean to be egotistical, but I am way ahead of my class in terms of CS knowledge (I am a perennial participant in the Congressional App Challenge and have written compilers and things like that). Whenever my teacher tries to explain why String s2 = s1; doesn’t actually copy the object, my peers don’t seem to understand the concept of references and memory addresses. All in all, they don’t seem to understand how a computer works at all - the compiler is the end of their world. Honestly I don’t feel that this is a Computer Science class and I feel it is more of a 10 month Java boot camp - and that too, outdated. Do you guys think students would benefit from learning how memory and stuff works before learning Java? Maybe as an AP Computer Science “T” or something. Realistically, the name “principles” best fits the idea of CS theory but the College Board is hellbent on teaching some irrelevant crap.",

        "text": "My boyfriend is a CS and Math major who loves to do his own hands on projects in his free time (probably not unlike some of you). I know most recently he used an Arduino to create this pedal thing for his drums (I do not understand when he explains it to me I am sorry).  I just know he is interested in quantum mechanics, ECE, theory ETC. sorry I can’t be more specific. I just think that he really loves hands on projects and I was wondering if anyone could recommend some gifts (like an arduino) that might be good for his interests. Thank you so much. \n\nI love to hear his passion for his projects and work I just do not know where to begin when it comes to giving a gift that facilitates these interests! \n\nHappy holidays.",

We guarantee this since we define the uniqueness of the certificate based on the statement when there is a finite set of positive integers, then there must be only one minimum. In addition, we define this finite set of positive integers as the set of certificates from an instance of Quadratic Congruences. Moreover, we show that this verifier can decide its inputs in polynomial time. In this way, we guarantee the problem Quadratic Congruences can be considered as a $UP$ language. Moreover, we use the properties of this polynomial verifier to search a solution for an instance of this problem. This is possible since we can start from a candidate that might not be a solution and then, we will start decreasing this value until we found the minimum possible value which might be a certificate or not. In addition, we show this algorithm can be done in polynomial time. Since Quadratic Congruences is a well-known NP-complete and P is closed under reductions, then we demonstrate that P is equal to NP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou could see the details in \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/37469408/P\\_versus\\_NP](https://www.academia.edu/37469408/P_versus_NP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ndownload it in\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://zenodo.org/record/1434304](https://zenodo.org/record/1434304)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance....",
