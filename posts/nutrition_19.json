I normally buy Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano for this purpose, and love their distinctive flavours and high protein content (33g/100g), but they can be a bit pricey. Recently, however, I saw a seemingly unremarkable grated cheese which nevertheless contains 45g of protein per 100g of protein and is notably cheaper than the two cheeses I usually buy per kilogram. It almost defies belief that grated cheese can pack so much protein and be relatively inexpensive, so I’m somewhat suspicious. The ingredients list reads: Raw and pasteurised milk, salt, rennet, preservative: egg lysozyme. What are your thoughts on this? Should I replace my Grana / Parmigiano with it and save some money? \n\nThanks in advance.",

They use [this](https://support.cronometer.com/hc/article_attachments/360028771331/NCCDB_full_2x.png) symbol as well as its name (NCCDB, USDA, etc) to indicate the lab-analyzed source of nutritional information.\n* When a user creates their own food and uploads it to Cronometer's database instead, it's reviewed and edited by their team to ensure accuracy so you won't ever see a 2kcal ice cream serving lmao. You can still make your own 'personal' food like the food label of a can or something, but it probably won't be uploaded to their database. Not-so-fun-fact: **The FDA allows up to a** [20% margin of error](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-guide-developing-and-using-data-bases-nutrition-labeling) **in** [food labels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605747/)**.**\n* It gives you a complete overview of what's going into your body, even things like micronutrients and the types of aminos in protein.\n* You can use the barcode scanner w/o premium 😎\n\nCronometer is criminally underrated for being the most accurate food tracker.",

        "text": "I've seen the argument put forth a number of times that the bioavailability of ALA and other fats from chia is rather low even if soaked, possible the same for other nutrients (instead they purport grinding). As I understand it, calorie estimates for foods don't take into account bioavailability (please correct me).
