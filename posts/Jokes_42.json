The priest declined again, saying \"I know God will save me.\"\n\nAt this point, the water had reached the priest's neck. A helicopter arrived, and dropped a ladder for the priest to climb onto. They used a megaphone to plead for the priest to get on, but to no avail. The priest simply said \"I know God will save me.\"\n\nThe helicopter left, and eventually the water rose too high, drowning the priest. When he reached the gates of heaven, he approached God. The priest asked God, \"Why did you leave me? I believed in you to save me, but you never even tried!\"\n\nGod, sounding very annoyed, snapped at the priest. \"Didn't try to save you!?
