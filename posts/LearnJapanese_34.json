        "text": "Hi all. I would like to ask — has anyone here started studying Japanese after learning Chinese (or any other challenging language) to a high degree of fluency ??\n\nI’m asking because I’m in this boat myself and getting cold feet knowing just how much time it’s going to take before I get comfortable with the language.\n\nFor background, I’m keen on Japanese out of personal interest only. No work or family reasons. I’ve traveled to Japan loads of times over the years (I’m based in Asia) and love the television programs, literature, video games, etc. Being able to consume native materials in Japanese would be a dream! So after building a foundation in the language , I would happily focus on passive skills only.\n\nI guess I should also add that I actually like the grind of learning a language and setting aside time everyday to review vocab. It gives me a small sense of accomplishment. My Chinese isn’t perfect by any means, but I’ve definitely passed the learner stage and don’t need a teacher anymore. So while I enjoy using Chinese everyday, I kind of miss the study part of it.\n\nI’m just a little reluctant to “dive in” because it took me 15 years to get to a comfortable place in Chinese. There’s no way I could spend the same amount of time learning Japanese at my stage in life now. That activates this nagging voice in my head — So why even bother then??\n\nTLDR:: Should I put in the time to learn Japanese after already investing so much time learning another language? Or am I overthinking this?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am still pretty new to learning Japanese. I largely still focus on learning kana and vocabulary. I recently started to play Dragon Quest 1 on the NES in order to help my hiragana memorization and maybe see if I can't get a bit more of a feel by translating the texts using dictionaries and other resources. While this may not be the fastest way of learning, I have definitely been having a blast, so I don't mind at all.\n\nAnyways, while the first couple sentences went by with surprisingly little effort, I have got myself stuck on just a couple of things. The first would be the appearance of the term \"いずこともなく\". After investigating it a while longer, I found that this seems to either be archaic or at least uncommon and that  \"どこともなく\" might be the more common way of saying and writing this. It seems to mean something like \"somehow\" or \"out of nowhere\". I can't seem to really be able to pick it apart further than this, even though it feels like a composite of some kind. The jisho dictionary calls it an adverb and portrays it as practically an entire word, it seems. Is there a point in me trying to understand the parts of this term or should I Just accept it as the word that means \"somehow\"?\n\nIn case it is relevant, here is the entire sentence in which the word appears:\n\nしかし いずこともなくあらわれた\n\nあくまのけしん りゅうおうが\n\nそのたまを やみにとざしたのじゃ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I have stumbled upon the term \"さずかり\".  Some work with the dictionary in addition to consulting a translator led me to believe that this means \"to be awarded\" and it does make sense in the context. Yet, the dictionary I am using merely has the form \"さずかる\" for that. What does the \"り\" mean in this case? Is it a type of conjugation?\n\nOnce again, this is the full sentence that this appears in:\n\nその むかし ゆうしゃロトが\n\nカミから ひかりのたまをさずかり\n\nまものたちをふうじこめたという\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I am asking quite a lot at once, especially for being very knew to learning this language myself. The fact that so far these are the only things I couldn't make sense of makes me quite motivated to keep this up, since I feel far more confident in my hiragana memorization ever since I started.\n\nThanks for reading and I'd love any advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I tagged it as a vocab question, though I believe that part of it also is a Grammar question. I hope this isn't too much of a problem.",

Instead, consider alternating between the less taxing vocab/grammar questions and the more tiring reading questions.\n\n(For N5/N4/N3, I think you will have to do your vocab section first, but you can still alternate between grammar and reading questions in the second section.)\n\nFor my first mock N2 test, I did all the vocab/grammar questions first and all the reading questions after, and it was exhausting doing reading question after reading question. I ran out of time with two reading questions left.\n\nFor my second mock test a month later, I alternated one page of vocab/grammar questions with one reading passage and finished with 15 minutes to spare. Yes, some of the studying I did during the month helped, but I was also just less tired throughout the test because I got a \"break\" after each reading.\n\nOf course, you still need to make sure your reading speed is sufficient. There's no point if you spend too much time on reading and run out of time to do the vocab/grammar questions.\n\nI haven't taken the actual JLPT yet (will take N2 in a week!), so if for some reason this technique won't work on the actual test, please let me know!",

        "text": "I recently came across a [webpage](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/learn-japanese-language-podcasts/) listing recommendations for podcasts to learn Japanese with.\n\nI was saddened to see that my favorite Japanese podcaster, *the incomparable* [*Teppei*](https://www.youtube.com/c/fzneko/videos), was not mentioned *at all*.\n\nSo here's my feeble attempt to right this wrong, at least a little.\n\nBefore going any further, let me state that, besides listening to his podcasts, I have no connection to Teppei.  Everything I write below is just my opinion, and I get nothing from it, other than the satisfaction of giving credit where it's due.\n\n**Why is Teppei my favorite?**\n\nFirst, the guy is *hilarious*!  Even with my very limited Japanese listening comprehension, I was laughing my head off with his recent piece on [unlucky numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRoxhBmDdu0), just to name the latest example.  At the very least, Teppei's podcasts always cheer me up, somehow.\n\nSecond, he is incessantly creative, constantly coming up with new modalities to help learners of Japanese.  For example, he produced a series on [\"katakana words\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTB1krh42uc&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvD9dgyX51q1fD7Ljy0i6zr9), one featuring [off-the-wall rap-like numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gI0XK1S4RE&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvCsYgniVMvTyG58FuvRrjtb), one featuring [zany (and often hilarious) fictional short stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJjU5tpW34M&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvBxxI24yBmAOQ5Ns63mZh4j), even one of [pieces to fall asleep to](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbsmSVzhiwvAzpJQTYF_bJbVPrukn3cNI).  His most recent projects are a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7HSPRN4) and a series to [train the listening of rank beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX1l7qr1bYw&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvDNi-QcBXFa4z2C_nIbKL4W).  This is all in addition to his long runing podcasts, for [beginner-intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drTGtJEvRCA&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvA8VNMAW_cuDqujRQULBjFd) and [intermediate-advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fza5Mre2-G4&amp;list=PLbsmSVzhiwvAxb9qofyPE4bIgFgXW-Qu7) listeners.\n\nBut, by far, what I most appreciate about Teppei is that he is a man with principles, and with the courage to live by them.  He decided to be a simple one-man operation, with all the difficulties, but also all the possibilities, that this represents, and sticking to it.  He decided to have no ads, and rely solely on voluntary support, and sticking to it.  He solo-produces new podcasts, at a daily rate, or pretty close to it.  For free.  He seems to me totally committed to this project.  Respect.\n\nThis post is one way for me to return the favor.",

        "text": "皆さん、こんにちは！I've recently been trying to learn and study/immerse in Japanese via video games. I found out about this way of studying from Matt from Game Gengo and have been really enjoying it and I can notice my Japanese improving too! However, I changed Matt's method from just playing the game, with breaking down the sentences, possibly with a game script, to (my method) of playing the game (usually without a game script), but using Game2Text to make flashcards of nearly every word that's being said in the story. But this means that it takes me SO much longer to get through a game because I have a massive backlog of cards on Anki, the cards double, or more the time it takes to get through a bit of text and it's been taking up a HUGE amount of time to review these cards, when I do just want to play through the game, for example I have about 8 hours in Dragon Quest, but because I'm creating cards it takes way longer than it should've. Obviously, since I'm still a beginner at Japanese I don't expect to be zipping through games, or anything, but I spend a lot more time making the flashcards than I do actually playing the games and I'm wondering if this is actually the best approach for learning Japanese via video games/ acquiring new words, or if I should just use Matt's method of just going through a game and if I see the word enough, I'll eventually learn the meaning and I would expect there to be a lot of overlap between games since I've already got about 4 games in Japanese and a lot of the words are in other decks. I'll finish the Anki decks I've made so far but just wondering if I should keep making flashcards or just play games, have more fun and pick up a decent few words along the way?\n\n Let me know how you guys do it, that'd be great, or how you'd recommend I go about learning Japanese through video games as I truly love learning this language through video games and it's definitely the most fun way I've seen, but just wondering what the best way to go about it is.",

Anything sounds in Japanese not natual to an English speaker can be formed and replicated easier due to our letters having individual sounds.",
