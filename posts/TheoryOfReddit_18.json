At time of me posting this the false claim has 6 upvotes and the correction 4. \n\nThe reason I chose this as an example is because this is /r/canada, and virtually every Canadian university outside Ontario has a preference for in province students, and also does not accept internationals. It's well known fact. If I had to guess, that entire comment was just a giant made up story.\n\nBut, I guess when redditors are enjoying the circlejerk they will turn a blind eye to what they know to be the truth. In a way, this emulates real life, as many Trump supporters *still* refuse to believe his dealings with Russia are anything more than a \"nothing burger\", the same way many Clinton supporters never accepted that her email situation was unethical. \n\n",

        "text": "Over the last several months, reddit has gone through some changes which on their own don't add much to the \"reddit experience,\" but altogether seem to show that reddit is trying to make it easier to advertise to users.\n\nIn March, reddit debuted the [reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/60i60u/tomorrow_well_be_launching_a_new_posttoprofile/). This allows users to post directly on their own user page rather than in a specific subreddit. While this allows certain power users to post stuff that may not fit in a particular subreddit, it could also be used for promotional posts that would otherwise be banned from subreddits. The Verge has an [article](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15009388/reddit-profile-pages-social-network-facebook-twitter) about profiles and how they can be used for advertisement:\n\n&gt;Even still, it’s easy to see how profile pages on Reddit remove one of the site’s most dearly held values: community regulation. Because many subreddits disallow promotional posts and fiercely enforce rules around formatting and content, the site has remained more or less impervious to the sway of big brands, marketers, and shameless self-promoters. Ohanian himself describes the profile page change as a way to remove the “stigma of self-promotion.” The inclusion of Riot Games in the initial beta test is also a clear indication that Reddit wants brands to have dedicated homes, not beholden to the community or its rulesets.\n\nOn May 16th, /u/powerlanguage posted in /r/changelog regarding post [view counts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6bj0iy/reddit_change_post_view_counts_users_here_now_and/) and the ability to see them. Regarding the expected outcome, /u/powerlanguage said\n\n&gt;We hope this number will provide feedback to users that create content on Reddit as well as give moderators some insight into how highly trafficked certain posts on their subreddit are.\n\nIt's entirely possible that this would be used as a tool for advertisers to tailor their posts to get the best results.\n\n\n\nOn the same day, /u/keysersosa posted to /r/modnews regarding the abolition of the site-wide [10-to-1 spam rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6bj5de/state_of_spam/). While the admin cites several reasons why the old system didn't work, they say that there are rules in place regarding spamming. Those rules can be found [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499): \n\n&gt;* If your contribution to Reddit consists primarily of submitting links to a business that you run, own or otherwise benefit from, tread carefully.\n\n&gt;* If you flood a Reddit community with posts or comments, you may be considered a spammer. Instead, post one or two times and see what happens.\n\n&gt;* If other users in a community historically downvote your posts or ones similar to yours, but you feel the need to continue submitting them anyway, you may be considered a spammer.\n\nWhile this would still allow moderators to heavily restrict self-promotion or advertisements made on theirs subs, look back at the first two points regarding the reddit profile and view counts. A company or agency would be able to post anything they want without any self-promotion rules in the way, and they'd be able to see the number of impressions each post gets. \n\nMore recently, /u/emoney04 announced in /r/modnews that reddit was beta testing [video hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6jo3re/moderators_help_us_beta_test_video_and_gif_hosting/) on reddit. This will allow users to upload videos straight to reddit rather than relying on third parties to host the content. The flip side of the is that [reddit will the creation of video advertisements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6jo3re/moderators_help_us_beta_test_video_and_gif_hosting/djftnj5/?context=1) (more info from WSJ [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-looks-to-lure-advertisers-with-video-and-redesign-1498125600)).\n\nAdded up, reddit may be trying to become an easier platform to advertise on. Users can post anything on their own profiles with no self-promotion rules to worry about, they can see how many impressions each of their posts have gotten, and reddit will allow video hosting that comes with video advertisements.",

I initially thought this was just a kind compliment by a kind hearted redditor, till I looked at his post history.\n\nApparently, he/it likes to compliment people A LOT, *several comments a minute*, on completely unrelated subreddits - from /r/h3h3productions to /r/Croatia. Pretty much in every single comment, he talks about how great or amazing the compliment-ee is, and how he's seen their username somewhere before.\n\nI kinda pointed this out to him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6jpsx5/no_religion_is_now_australias_number_one_religion/djgflft/), and I pretty much instantly recieved gold on my original comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6jpsx5/no_religion_is_now_australias_number_one_religion/djgfjpr/). I found that very odd, as my comment was very much not gold worthy, and was only ~10 minutes old with 4 points when I got the gold, so I'm thinking I got it from our mystery commenter.\n\n\nI asked Jimmy if he was a bot, he responded \"I'm not a bot, just a fast typer :)\nLove you though\". I don't buy that, with several comments outputted per second there's no way this thing is human. This makes me more and more intrigued as to the motivations. Is it nobly motivated, with the intention to spread love and kindness to peoples' days? Maybe.\n\n\nI have another theory. This is a 10 day old account that's so far accumulated 5000 comment karma. Could it be that the creator of the alleged bot is using this as a karma farm?\n\nI don't know. Quite the mystery\n\n\n\nI'm convinced this is a bot, but what purpose does it serve? How is the bot able to spam so much comments? Why?\n\n\nEdit: Corrected one of the links",

If someone gives it a vote up, it will soon be downvoted again. It seems like there is a small clique who have dedicated their time to downvote everything for no reason. A post may even have a handful of upvotes, like 6, and shortly after it is zero. No explanation is given, no replies or anything. None of the threads I have seen so far deserves to be downvoted to zero.\nAnd if you look at the posts in a thread, it is the OP's main post that is downvoted. All the OP's other posts in the same thread is usually ignored.\n\nOf course, once a thread reach a certain popularity and becomes hot, the number of upvotes will be be too much for the downvoters to handle, since they are in a minority (most people doesn't vote at all). But they are ruining the chance of other posters, and their posts soon disappears into obscurity. So for at least the Twin Peaks board, the downvoting culture has gone too far. But that is maybe the main trend on all boards dealing with popular movies, shows and other topics that gains a lot of attention from the public.\n \n",

Trying to filter out things I really and truly don't care about, subs not in English, etc. When I went to add another one recently (my 101st sub) I get the message \"no more space for subreddits in that multireddit\". \n\nWhy can't I add more?",

        "text": " So I have this dilemma where one source says that you should vote a post/comment based on the following\n\n\"Does it contribute to the discussion, regardless of if it represents your opinion or not?\" If yes, you like. If not, you dislike.\n\nAnd the other one.\n\n\"Do you like it and/or agree with it?\" if yes, you like. If no, you dislike.\n\n The latter seems to be beneficial for people who \"go with the flow\", anything the majority doesn't like gets rofltromped and not taken seriously. The former seems better for everyone, since even those who have controversial opinions can be accepted.\n\n So which is it?",
