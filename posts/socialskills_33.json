        "text": "I'm a college student really struggling to read my friend. Although I'm probably awkward, I wanted to force myself to meet and collaborate with new people so I started a video game club at my college and ended up making about 3 friends through this club that I see more often and will call them John, Max, and Sean.   \n\nOut of all of them, I get on really well with John and Max since we play a lot of the same games and we have similar communication styles. We both love to go on and on about our topics of preference but enjoy listening to each other as well.   \n\nSean on the other hand is really hard for me to socialize with and I don't really know if it's me, him, or neither. We play 2 of the same games but that's it. When I try to task about his day, he gives short answers that are hard for me to work with. When I ask questions about his major or classes or campus job, same thing. When I share anything on my mind or something related to topics I'm interested in like psychology or philosophy, he will just say \"gotcha\" or \"huh.\", so I try to ask him about sports and fitness but then it just sometimes feels like a one-sided interrogation that shuts down if I share my thoughts. If I come into the room, they might say hi or nod but will just continue scrolling on their phone but if the 2 other guys come he welcomes them and initiates interactions with them more often. \n\nI basically told him that he always seemed very unapproachable to me but he would tell me that I was overthinking it or that he doesn't know what to say, but I don't really know of any other friend that looks so bored and unapproachable that I feel anxious with a fear of rejection when approaching them.  \n\nWhat's frustrating is that it makes the group dynamics weird. I honestly don't like inviting Sean to stuff because it's really painful to invite someone who you think will either reject if it were only you or go with you but look bored and miserable, but if I don't invite him he interrogates me and acts as if he treats me the same way that my other friends do when it's far from true. I don't want to isolate him but it feels like he's limiting my ability to create stronger friendships with the other guys.  \n\nAdvice?",

Rationally speaking I know that it is completely ridiculous to think that way, and I should know I realistically wouldn't annoy her. Like if I asked her if I did annoy her, she would probably think I'm crazy for asking that lol. Maybe this is a weird thing to ask, but I'm wondering if there's any good way I could try to rationalize to myself and convince myself better that I'm completely fine. Thank you!",

You might be thinking that I may come across as pushy or giving vibes that I am interested in anything romantic and stuff but I don't let the conversation go in that direction and most of things I say are related to small talk stuff that u say to start a conversation and now I just don't even try to say anything but I figured out I should give one last try by posting this on reddit.

Idk how to get her to stop, but it’s making me really uncomfortable, especially since I only like her platonically.

Any type of argue that he had lost he tried to hurt himself in all ways possible. \n  And this “leader” dude, didn’t liked the fact that i have a kind of leader personality too(doesn’t mean I want/think to be more important than others) so he started making fun of me, way more than anyone else, and it’s not the usual man harassment, is real things that really hurts. And some other friends started being hostiles with me too. And those friends are really nice with me when the “leader” is not around(i think they are too afraid to be harassed like this, so they do the easier, they target someone that is already being hurt and hurt him more). Also they kinda follow everything he says, like he’s right all the time. Even when i say something they don’t laugh at all, but when it comes out of he’s mouth in the exact same way they all laugh like never did in their life. Yes, I wish they treated me at least with respect, but the environment turned so\nToxic that they got used to it.\n\nIn this group i have one friend that notices that a lot and he’s my bestfriend, i got closer to him, and we have a great friendship, but even when he complains of me being treated like shit, the group turn hostile with him too. Also, everything i say in the group when they are playing videogames together, they are extremely hostiles, because they are in the discord saying the best eay to harass me. I don’t really know what i am looking for saying this here, but I wanted to vent a little. Sometimes I think they are jealous of me, because im kinda “good” with girls,  i workout, and mostly because I am confident and happy with the world. So they need to lower me so I could be like them. It’s like, real world people like me a lot and stuffs but inside this group they don’t.  And yea I should probably find some new people to be friends with, but it’s not everyone in the group, it’s 4 people. And the others basically don’t say anything.\n\n\nWhile I was writing I noticed what I want venting here. I want to know if u had something like this in your life and what you did, what would you do in my place. Im not actually sad, i got used to it, but I wish our relationship were less toxic, its not like i dont want people making fun of me, its actually normal, my relation with my best friend is like this, we make fun of each other in a healthy way.\n\nThanks for reading, and be around people that likes you(even tho im not doing this)",

Given the fact that i have a track record of screwing up the reaction to this kind of news, I wanted to wait until someone else responded, so I wouldn't make things awkward by saying something stupid. Unfortunately, there wasn't really a response. Only a few vaguely reassuring noises, before the conversation moved to a different topic. \n\n\nI hope he doesn't feel like we just glossed over it, but it felt like that to me. And i feel like an asshole because of  that.  But i honestly don't know what i should've said. Death is too much of a touchy subject to respond to without any background information and knowing how he feels about it. He's usually very silent, so noticing the difference between normal conversation and a serious/emotional one can be challenging. Both of us being a bit shy/introverted doesn't help either.\n\n\nIf anyone has some advice about dealing with these kind of situations, and what to say when he's back, I'd be very grateful.",

However, I talk a whole lot better on one on one conversations than group conversations. Group conversations don't even make much sense to me to be honest.",

        "text": "A friend I've had for a long time messages me frequently. We live in different cities but come home to towns which are close.\nSadly, she has just left a toxic romantic relationship and has come home to spend time with family for a week. I am also at home meaning we are closer to eachother. \n\nThroughout the time she realized this romantic relationship was toxic, left, and is recovering we have been messaging very closely. I put a lot of effort into our conversations and the advice/support I give. I care about her a lot. We both agreed to meet up over this week. I messaged her a time and place offer. She responded saying she had a nice day planned with family. In response I said it's cool, let me know what day you're free this week. Obviously that was fine. \n\nShe said she will. As the conversation progressed she told me she's going to a city 2/3 hours away this week to see her friend in another city then coming home.\n\nI am probably overthinking, I'm pretty sure I have some social anxiety and often feel like people don't actually like me. But I feel like I'm not a priority and that she's not making as much of an effort to see me in person as I am. I care about this person and don't feel bitterness towards her. I just don't want to feel like I'm more of a counsellor for advice than somebody she wants to spend time with. She's going through a lot and I am happy to listen and support her, but in that way I feel like we should be meeting in person. Is this something I should bring up, I feel like it's not since she's recovering from something traumatic. I don't feel like it's mature to suddenly talk about our relationship/myself as she has opened up to me a lot. But honestly I'm not sure. \n\nI hope I can get some advice, please be kind.",

I'll just call the groups A and B for simplicity.  \n\n\nGroup A dates back to High School, and Group B came along about 4 years ago. I enjoy being a part of both groups a lot, but, well, the thought of both groups mingling with one another is a bit of a nightmare scenario in my mind. They're pretty different from one another- There's a couple of overlapping hobbies and interests there, but for the most part, the things I do with each group are different, and I guess as a result, I act differently in one group compared to the other. I'm still myself, but I guess different sides of my personality show depending on who I am with.  \n\n\nThere's also the matter of the things we talk about and all that. There's some things that, while I may be perfectly fine sharing with Group A, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing with Group B, and vice versa. I'm not really the type of guy who likes sharing everything with everyone around him, whether it's personal matters or some of my more niche interests. I think you guys get the idea here.  \n\n\nSo what do you think? Is this weird, or do a lot of people do this? Would it be rude if, for example, a friend from Group A wanted to get involved in something with Group B, and I said no?",

I had to cut all contact.\nThe only person I have is my boyfriend (whom I adore and appreciate) but recently I've just started to feel so much shame around not having friends anymore? I feel like if I admit that to people or they figure it out they'll think I'm boring or fucked up. Maybe I am boring but I'm really trying to be good and kind even though I'm always annoyed by everyone.\nAlso my boyfriend always tells me I should make some friends so \"I don't get bored of him\" but the thing is... I just don't want to. I think I might be a little depressed. I just feel hate and resentment towards everyone right now. I miss the feeling of hanging out in a group, laughing till your stomach hurts but the thought of having to search for that seems so daunting. I get very insecure, I'm scared people secretly dont like me, im scared to be criticized, I'm scared to \"do something wrong\" and I just never ever feel comfortable with people. Even the nice moments I used to have with friends were fleeting, bc I'd already be wrecking my head over something they said on the way home, thinking they don't like me or feeling attacked by a small comment they made. I'm too sensitive. I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me and I don't know why or how to fix it.",

I've started to lose weight as a rate I'm happy with, I'm exercising fairly often, and I'm able to get myself to shower and brush my teeth every day. I'm now more so just maintaining my improvements, which is causing me to really crave friendship again.\nThere's a group of girls I shared some classes with in my junior year. I always enjoyed talking to them, and they always seemed much more open than most other people. We don't share any classes any more, so I'm not able to talk to them much anymore, other than one of them that always says hi when we see eachother. I really want to try to make friends with them, but I don't know how. I've thought about asking to sit with them at lunch, but like I said, I'm really not great at talking.

I understand that I may need therapy but that’s the situation right now. As a result, I’m pretty quiet and keep to myself. I am also polite and I think all of these traits combined allow people to think they can treat me any which way. \n\nToday I needed to grab something from production support. I work in the sciences and certain doors cannot be open at the same time when passing materials in; consequently, I couldn’t hear the two women across the closed doors well and they started to get frustrated with me. One of them rolled their eyes and started scoffing and making fun of me with the other woman. They were both super rude to me and talked down to me like I’m a dumbass, mind you we are all around the same age, because I grabbed something I wasn’t supposed to. I not a dumbass;I graduated from a tough school with a major that weeds out nearly everyone who started it and I was scouted into our fortune100 company without ever applying. I understand the frustration, but I don’t think them talking at me and treating me like shit was warranted, as I remained polite and respectful. They rudely told me to leave and come back for what I needed. \n\nI go back and they’re mad rude telling me “are you back to take what you’re waiting for? You’re gonna have to wait 🙄🙄🙄” &amp; then the one who was making fun of me starts mumbling things about me. \n\nI have had enough at this point. Between the  lead in my department that has been bullying me and older men who talk down at me like I know nothing…one person can only take so much.\n\n A flip switched in me and without a stutter &amp; very sternly I said to them “yeah actually I got the okay to take this into the central lab and finish cleaning it. Also ladies, I think you’re both capable of communicating better than this. I couldn’t hear you and I misunderstood what you were saying, but you didn’t have to speak to me like that and I absolutely do not appreciate how you’re both coming at me while I am simply trying to get this material. Thanks.” They looked sad and couldn’t make eye contact with me. I simply took what I needed and left. Now I feel a little guilty about it.",

        "text": "I (F26) am currently in a rigorous graduate program and the program is sort of unique in that we will be with the same classmates in every single class for 2 years. My class group only has 18 people in it and it’s already past a year and everyone knows each other pretty well whether they want to or not. It’s just the nature of it when you’re constantly doing everything together. We see each other and have to work together more than we see anyone else in our lives currently: more than our friends, family, or significant others. Naturally no one wants to be on bad terms with anyone, however after one year there is already pretty bad drama and some people really hate each other. That is one of my greatest fear. I don’t need to be friends with these people but I would like to be able to get along amicably. However I am pretty socially awkward and I am a weeb so I feel like I can get along with my normie classmates to a certain extent, but since this is a program that makes us in such close proximity I feel myself backing away from my classmates a lot of the times because they have very strong personalities and I get very intimidated. I want to be able to talk to them freely but I also freeze up a lot of the times and kind of just walk away. I am actually a very extroverted person but I have been so deep with the anime community for so long that I feel like I don’t really know how to connect with my normie peers. My classmates are the kind of people who love clubbing and partying and drinking and I’m the kind of person who just prefers chill hangouts talking about our hobbies, playing games, or going karaoking. So I feel like our vibes are on parallel lines.\n\nWe used to all do hangouts as a class and everyone was invited and we used to talk to each other more and interact with each other freely. But cliques started forming and everyone starting becoming cold and occasionally hostile with each other. There is especially this one giant clique that are really close to each other and they would only hang out with each other all the time. The rest of the remaining class group kind of hangs out by themselves, pairs, or triples. That one giant clique dominates the rest of the class group vibes simply because of the number of people sticking up to each other. They dominate the group chat, the class vibe, and have a louder voice than the rest of us. It used to be that I could approach any of my classmates and talk about school stuff but now if I were to do the same thing they would stare at me or it would be very stand-offish and cold. I mostly hangout with these two other girls but I could also tell they are kind of sad to be excluded from the one main big group. I think they also miss the times where everyone would interact freely. I feel like this has really taken a hit on my self-esteem and I see myself isolating myself from my peers more often now because I am so scared of their cold personas now. And I feel like doing that only drives me further away from my classmates. There is especially this one classmate who is really passive aggressive with me. From the very beginning I was kind of intimidated by him because he has a really strong personality and I knew from history that I have always had trouble getting along with these kind of people. I tried, regardless, to put myself out of my comfort zone and try to talk to him to the best of my ability. But I think overtime he got really fed up with me being intimidated by him and now is always very passive aggressive and sometimes even just blatantly ignores me. I feel like you can very obviously tell when I am comfortable with someone because I am very warm and inviting.\n\nI feel like a lot of this isolation with my classmates come from my own mind and me telling myself the situation is a lot worse than it probably is. But it a fact that it has become a lot more difficult to freely interact with my classmates compared to the past. Also gossiping is really rampant amongst my classmates, like the plague. It’s like people can’t stop talking about other people behind their backs. I don’t take part in the gossiping ever and I don’t say anything about anyone ever even if they say something bad about me. I am extremely careful about that. And I feel like doing so has bypassed any of my classmates from like absolutely hating me, which is already better than some of my classmates situations. I mean after all that effort though it still didn’t stop people from disliking me. There has been some small conflicts between me and some other classmates over the course of the year but I resolved a lot of those by approaching my classmates and apologizing if I did anything that made them uncomfortable or upset, and then everything was fine. I’ve told my friends about these situations before and my friends says I’ve got to stop apologizing for things I didn’t even do anything wrong for and respect myself more. But I would rather take the L and apologize if it would get rid of the tension because I hate overextended tension with people the most. I feel like unresolved tension always gets worse and it’s the most awful feeling to me ever. But I feel like I am so tired of overextending myself and approaching people first, but I have to do it because I feel like having the tension is even worse. The program is also really hard and I have depression so I feel so weary. I am currently in therapy and am working out through my issues but also I feel like I’ve been at a loss as to what to do with my classmates especially with that one passive aggressive classmates. Wow this was really long but I wanted to give the whole picture.",

        "text": "I apologize if this seems like a miscategorized post, but I would argue that writing is, in fact, a social skill. You don't write unless you want something to be read, after all, and I'm curious about approaching this question from a social perspective: how is the tone perceived, and what effect does it have on my ethos as the narrator?\n\nI've always had this problem with my writing tone: I tend either toward pretentious, pedantic polysyllabism, or I sound too casual and crass, and often it seems like there's no in-between; it's inconsistent, all over the place. I'd like to find a happy medium that isn't too casual but doesn't come off as arrogant.\n\nOne response might be: \"hey, then maybe don't use pretentious words, like 'polysyllabism.'\" (Okay, but that one was just for effect, in my defense.) \n\nI'd be lying if I said that no part of me wants to impress (I don't think anyone can say that truthfully). But the main reason why I speak the way I do in my writing is... that's just what comes to mind; I say what I think. And I *like* using words like that (I just think some words are *spicier*; I love reading someone else's writing and thinking, \"Dang, that's spicy. I haven't heard that word in a long time.\") and attempting (and often failing) to be precise in what I'm expressing, which is why sometimes I write sentences with many clauses, qualifications, and adjectives. \n\nSo, sometimes I come off as pretentious. But I'm not really meaning to. And, at least I acknowledge it?\n\nI don't want to stop writing like myself. But I don't want to sound off-putting either. What can I do to be and sound more relatable, without necessarily changing myself? Self-deprecate more? Swear more? (Which I do.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, don't be rude. Just because something is \"true\" doesn't mean it's worth saying.\n\nI have very thin skin.\n\nIf you are rude, I'll probably just ignore you or filter you out with a browser extension, or I'll say something snarky and unhelpful.",

I wasnt dumb. It was just boring as heck. I didnt get anything about history in school but nowadays im so interested in it that i wathc history documentaries in my spare time. While others are partying, getting laid and having their wild times im sitting in my home alone, watching youtube all day, read books and articles and being a nerd. Once when a teacher asked me in front of the entire class if the glass is half full or half empty because i never agreed on one particular thing, i straight up said, \"Depends on what is inside. If its medicine i want it half empty. If its coke i want it to be half full\". In my eyes that was important to know. Instead of having a discussion with me they said that they cant change me anymore. They didnt even think about why i would say that. I get the feeling that people expect me to be like the rest of society and be \"normal\". A part of me wishes to be that way to but then i know that i would lie to myself and just be a drone that is a cog in a system. I dont want to be outside the machine. I want to be a cog in the spot i want to be surrounded by like-minded cogs with whom i can talk about the things that truly interest me like literature, philosophy, history and all the other stuff that. I dont want them to be snobish douchebags who think that they are something better but just people who show an interest in that and share opinions, viewpoints and ideas but i think that i can do that. I want to feel like im in a society where i belong and can be myself without feeling insecure about. Dont know what to do.",

While I’m still figuring it out, I think the main issue is that I tend to say things that either the other person has no way of responding to in a way that can continue the conversation, or the thing I say is just an inherent conversation-ender (even though I don’t intend it to be, of course), if that makes sense. I started realizing this after I noticed that a lot of awkward silences follow when I’m the last person to say something.\n\nNow my new issue is trying to figure out how to say things that will keep the convo going 😅 Just wanted to vent a little about this. If anyone has advice, that would also be appreciated.",

I’m 21F but not in college/school, I do work in a trade but all of my coworkers are significantly older than me at my current job and I do get along with them but they’re not really people I’d want to hang out with outside of work. I also already have a group of very close friends who I talk to on a daily basis but they all live in different states so it’s not often that we can all meet up in person. I just am missing in person social interaction with people, particularly women, my own age who aren’t my boyfriend and his friends.\n\n I’m just not sure how to make new friends in this city as all of my current friends are from when I was in college. Most of the advice online seems tailored toward older people, like I don’t think many people my age are going to meetup groups or playing sports through the parks and rec department lol (though I could be wrong). The advice of going to bars could work because I do live near a lot of colleges but I drink pretty rarely and don’t want to build friendships based on drinking when it’s just not something I like to do often. What else can I do to try to meet people?",

        "text": "One of my coaching clients told me a story this week. There is a local community space in her area that puts on epic concerts and events. From her first time entering the space many months ago, she has wanted to be more involved with the community. But she didn't know how to do this. The result: she feels lonely, guilty, and fearful. She's lonely when she goes to events there because she tends to isolate herself when she's there. She feels guilty because she knows she isn't living her full potential. And she's fearful to do anything differently. In our recent session we broke this down, moved through her bottlenecks, and came up with an action plan for her to pursue her dreams. **I'm sharing her story here confidentially in case anyone else is struggling with a similar challenge and is looking for a solution.**\n\nShe didn't know where to start. Starting something new is scary and usually the hardest part. I completely understand this and have lived this countless times. We magnify our problem (I'm not where I want to be) and that keeps us from achieving our goals because we recreate this reality every single day. Just a few small shifts in our perception and actions can make all the difference. This is key! It takes the pressure off of making massive changes and helps us focus on what we can truly control and improve upon.\n\nThe first step we came up with together was to establish communication. I had her fill out a contact form on their website. Basically: \"hi, I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_. I'm passionate about music and community. Your space has been really impactful in my time here and I love coming to your events. I'm wondering if there are any opportunities to become more involved with your organization. Would someone from your team be willing to talk on the phone for 15 minutes so I could learn more about your mission?\" I also had her call the place to ask a few questions: \"I saw on your website that you have an event this weekend. Is this still happening? Are there any events not listed on your website that I could attend?\" These actions help get the gears turning and give her some positive reference experience.\n\nThe second step is to come up with a list of questions that she has. You see, in our minds we have all of these questions floating around that are never going to get answered. A great step to find answers is to put the questions down into the physical form - grab a pencil and paper and write out 3-5 questions that you have about getting involved. Also write 1-2 sentences for each question about *why* you are asking them. Now you have a few talking points about yourself as well as the necessary questions to learn more information.\n\nThe third step would be set up the call or meeting if they are able to meet with you. Obviously there is some nuance here, but it's pretty straightforward. Arrange a call, discuss your points, and ask your questions.\n\nA fourth step would be to show up. Show up to the call. Show up to events. Arrange more meetings and hangouts. Key point here: Truly show up. Don't just go and do the same old thing. Adopt a new mindset, a new intention. Meet people. Shake hands. Ask questions. Have fun. The more you engage with people in this space, the more comfortable you will start to feel. Think of it as a practice. You won't be perfect the first time. But by continuing to show up and putting your energy into something that you love, you will start to learn more about how you fit in. Opportunities will arise as if from nowhere, but you've created them with your persistence.\n\nAnd the fifth step is to follow-up. Keep conversations moving with staff and patrons. Keep coming up with questions and talking points that help you uncover more collaboration. Develop connections with people through coffee meetups, showing up to social events, and eventually creating your own shared experiences.\n\nThis week I'll be checking in with my client to see what happens. I'm sure she will have questions. I'm sure she can uncover the answers. I told her there will likley be mistakes and lessons. But this is where we grow. This is how we get from \"who we are\" to \"who we want to be.\" Small steps each day towards our goals. \n\nAnd one day further down the road, we lift up our head and we realize that we have created the life we want. We have networked our way into the situations we desire. We are the person that we want to be. And that's magic.",

I've spent the first 25 years of my life in this mentality/thought process so it's going to take time to unlearn some of it. The difference today is that I’m committed to showing my brain there’s nothing to actually be scared of.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nAs I walked around the supermarket, I looked for someone who seemed approachable. Finally, I approached an old lady and asked her for music recommendations. At first, she was confused, but after some explanation, she suggested the Bee Gees. As we parted ways, I walked home with a silly grin on my face, listening to some Bee Gees and feeling proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone.\n\n**Thoughts:** \n\nOnce I'd gotten over the approach, today was no different than any other interaction, the only difference was me getting into my own head. I think with time,  that voice of self-doubt will diminish until it's almost a whisper and then I could approach a complete stranger, ask them something off the cuff and have the same emotional state as if I were ordering a coffee.\n\nIt's such as simple thing, approaching a stranger and it really is making me more confident.

This may be obvious to you but it never occurred to me.",

And I can't usually tell when the person wants to get off the phone.\n\nHow do other people signal they are done with the conversation, and how/when can I make that signal myself without coming off rude?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice I get",

Is there a way to keep my voice the same all the time. I could be speaking to someone and in one conversation I have a certain voice and the next conversation I have with them I'll have a completely different voice. I have a wide vocal range so every voice i have sounds like a completely different person. I've overheard people talking about how weird it is that my voice changes so much, I dont know what the hell is wrong with me but I need a fix.",

I hate this!!\n\nI desperately need advice, help, anything to make this first step less painful.

Across from you, there is a a different owner sobbing because their pet has just been euthanized. It's just the two of you in the waiting room. The receptionist is busy in a different part of the clinic.\n\nYou feel awkward sitting there in silence while a stranger sobs in front of you. What would you do? Ignore the stranger completely and make small talk/say \"sorry for your loss\"?",
