We were finally able to locate 30mg XR and I picked it up this evening. \n\nDr. says 30mg is within prescribing dose for my weight but recommended I cut them in half for the first dose so it doesn’t hit me like a truck if the dosage is too high. When I picked them up, they’re capsules and obviously can’t be cut. \n\nI’ll take my first dose in the morning, and I’ve got shit to do tomorrow. Any tips in case it hits me like a truck and makes me want to crawl out of my own skin? Will food, exercise, etc help take the edge off if necessary? Just trying to plan ahead so I’m as prepared as possible.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, reading through this subreddit ive noticed alot of misconceptions pop up frequently. I work in the med pharma field and i have adhd myself. Being a medicine nerd that's tried most meds available I have researched my own condition and the meds (stimulants) in great depth. I hope this doesn't rub anyone the wrong way but these finsings i'm presenting here are all based on actual research and can be found openly on public reaearch papers. So here goes:\n\n- Stimulants very frequently make you FEEL thirsty but they do not dehydrate you, they simply dry out the lining in youe mouth (mucosa). Keeping yourself hydrated is always good but thinking that you will become dehydrated and that drinking water will make them work better is just not correct.  One big caveat here is Concerta which has to have enough water in the gut to work properly but even then you'd have to really be dehydrated (which is a hard thing to pull off if you're a healthy person).\n\n- Protein has not shown to increase or prolong stimulant effects. What seems to be a better idea is prevent low blood sugar and besides a good night's sleep I'd say is the biggest thing you can do to make its side effects feel less horrible and make the medication work better. The brain works on oxygen and glucose (blood sugar) and being deficit in it is roughly equivalent to depriving yourself brain of oxygen and expecting yourself to act and perform like normal, it just won't happen.\n\n- it's a very common tip around reddit that caffeine can help with the stimulant crash or even intensify its effects. However, the truth is that caffeine (coffee or energy drinks) itself is a stimulant in itself so all you are actually doing is mixing two stimulants at once. Most of the time this is not a good idea. A better idea would be to hone in the correct dosage of the stimulant meds you are rakinf eather than having to supplement it with another. The risk is that you might experience two crashes at once. Oh and the same thing goes for nicotine that's in cigarettes or patches.\n\n- Stimulants can destroy your sleep, not only in the hours of less sleep you kgiht experience but also the quality of it if not managed properly or taken too late in the day. This in turn can lead to a 'sleep deficit', and in turn lead to your brain not working nearly as well as it should, in effect making the medication itself less effective. Sleep and proper nutrition seems to be the pillars in getting the best out of your stimulant medication. \n\n- Physical exercise can enhance the stimulant effect as shown in plenty of studies and can be an effective method to get rid of the jittiriness of their crashes. Exercise enhances the brain's abilityto withstand stress and makes rhe body able to betterwithstand physical exertion, in turn making your body not react as harshly to the stimulant crash effects as well.",

The small ones annoy me and build mistrust but it’s the big promises like moving out with me and not following through that leads to a break up. For months he will tell me he’s saving money and is excited about moving out. I believe it and do the same. When I set up an appointment with a realtor that’s when he tells me he can’t move out because he hasn’t saved money or fixed his credit. So I leave him.\n\nIt usually takes a month before we get back in contact and we start dating again. The last time I told him we need to see a couples therapist. \n\nAfter three years and couples therapy he finally was able to move out with me. Him (M 38yrs) me ( F 29 yrs). The therapist  mentioned that he may have “Peter Pan syndrome”. A few months later he was diagnosed with ADHD by another provider. \n\nThis made more sense to me. He procrastinates, bad with money, a people pleaser, adventures and passionate about his interests ( music )\n\nThe first few months of living together was great and I really believed therapy was good for us. He was finally following through with his promises. I started to trust him again. So we felt like we didn’t need to go anymore. We even got engaged a few months later.\n\nFast forward a year post therapy and three months after engagement and he is back to the old version of himself that lead us to break ups. \n\nHe’s car broke down ( a month ago) and he has yet to fix it. He rather spend his money on Uber than fix his car( a few months prior his car was towed for non payment )\nWhen we got engaged we had to cancel our dinner reservation because we ended up getting Covid. He “promised “ me he would reschedule it and do it the right way. It’s been three months and still nothing. I still haven’t received my birthday gift he promised me in January. He NEVER seems to have money although the works 2 jobs. I always feel like I have to remind him to be an adult and pay his bills. \n\nI feel like a mother and it’s a big turn off. \n\nI know it’s his adhd but he won’t get the help for it. I even mentioned couples therapy again and he finds an excuse or reason to not go back. \n\nI usually would be out the door by now but we live together and I’m back in school and can’t afford the rent alone.\n\nIm so conflicted!\n\nA part of me wants to work it out. We have been through so much together. I do love him and we get along over all. Which makes it hard to leave. But another part of me is tired and frustrated. I don’t know if I can live like this forever. If I do marry him I fear that it will end in a divorce if he continues this. HELP!",

When should I take it? she said I could split my pill and take each half (.5 mg) at different times of day…without telling me what time of day to take it. when should I take it? Obviously I know to talk to my psychiatrist but she was hesitant to prescribe it as is when I insisted that it might help with my side effects from Vyvanse, so I’m not sure she’ll be much help. I’m getting a new one anyways due to an insurance change. \n\nAny advice?

Seriously, multi-tasking is my kryptonite, and thinking back it was really rude of my mother when she would scold me and tell me why I forgot to do most of the chores when I was younger, and that multi-tasking was easy for her so I must be making excuses because I'm lazy. Still waiting on that diagnosis, doc! \n\nAnyways, I was texting my friend about why it can be difficult for people with ADHD to stay focused on one task, in this example why it can be hard for me to commit to writing a chapter from start to finish without pausing for hours or days on end. And I was telling him that often I get distracted easily without noticing, but halfway through my text I pause and search up a vocabulary word to make sure I had the right definition. That led me to looking up more about ADHD to be sure I wasn't sharing false information. That led me here where I began reading about other people's posts with ADHD. That led to me learning about how hard it is for people to study and focus on lectures at school, which I relate to since I'm in Uni as well, that led to another thing, Yada Yada Yada. Then I realize, I spent a damn hour and didn't even finish telling him how easily I get distracted. \n\nThat was a sitcom moment, cross my heart I am not making this up for fun 😭 but I hope it brought a smile to your day!",

When I finally got diagnosed with ADHD, they put me on adderall ir's and I've been on them ever since because they have always worked perfectly for me and even helped my depression quite a bit. Over the last year, however, I noticed my meds weren't working like they used to. It has been more and more difficult to stay on task or to even think, I am always fatigued, and have chronic brain fog. \n\nI have made every single lifestyle change I can think of to try and mitigate this (regular tolerance breaks, 8 hours of sleep every night, exercise, only drinking water and green tea, rarely drinking alcohol, eating healthy foods as much as I can, taking vitamin D, fish oil, and magnesium, ice cold showers, going on daily morning walks to get vitamin d from uv rays, etc.) to no avail. I also tried upping my dosage, but when that didn't help very much I chose to go back down to my original 2x20 dose. I see my dr regularly, and my vitals are always normal.  \n\nThings in my personal life over the last year have definitely worsened my depression, so I'm now wondering if that could be the reason my meds aren't working properly. I've been on adderall for years, so I know its not a miracle drug and you still have to make a somewhat conscious effort to stay on task, but even making that choice has never been as difficult as it has been lately. I'm currently in the middle of writing my thesis for school, and even though its on a subject I am passionate about, I find myself staring at the same page for days at a time because I have lost the ability to think in nuance. I can only make surface level observations and connections because the brain fog is so relentless. I just feel so stuck in my own mind, and I want to know if anyone else has dealt with this.\n\nI have an appointment with my GP next week, and I plan to ask them about looking into antidepressants. I've never taken any so I don't really know the differences between them, besides the mechanical differences between ssri / snri / ndri, etc. Has anyone had a similar experience, and if so, how did you deal?",

I am 8 years sober and pretty averse to personal use of stimulant meds. Doc prescribed Strattera (atomoxetine) starting at 10mg, and after trying to increase to 20mg, I found that even though I have noticed a lot of improvement (and obviously no potential for addiction or mood alteration in the addictive sense), I was unhappy with the side effect of emotional flatness—we went back down to 10mg. I haven’t experienced any other significant side effects from atomoxetine, and the subtle improvements in focus and anxiety reduction make me feel hopeful. I have felt far less overwhelmed by responsibilities and my busy life. \n\nToday, the doc decided we should try to add 150mg of Wellbutrin XL (bupropion) to help with task initiation and the emotional blunting caused by Strattera. No plans to increase Strattera dose from 10mg. \n\nI’m nervous to start the Wellbutrin because I’ve read a lot of negative experiences, and I know these two medications tend to interact. Not sure what to expect, and wondering if anyone has any relatable experience with this combination. For context, I weigh only 120 lbs., am pretty sensitive to medication because I don’t consume any mood-altering substances, and I really just want to feel as much like myself as possible while addressing these attention issues.",

Today I stumbled on a technique that actually gets me to start on my tasks and work for several hours. \n\nThe technique is quite simple: meditate for at least 2 minutes on the worst mental torture you can imagine. I envisioned the mental discomfort of being forced to slave away on 10x the amount of work I currently have, while being stabbed with sharp needles.  I noticed that after a minute or so of this \"torture fantasy\", the pain miraculously started to dull away - very much as if my brain was releasing endorphins to compensate for the \"shock\". Right afterwards, I was able to start work and not feel any of the mental pain that was holding me back!\n\nI used this technique to get myself to work in 25 minute blocks (Pomodoros) with 5 minute meditation \"booster sessions\" in between. Doing this, I was able to complete 5 hours of solid work today for the first time in a long time - and it was relatively easy!\n\nI would love if some of you folks would try this technique and let me know your experience. I want to know if this could maybe help a lot of other people, or if my brain is just weirdly responsive to masochism 😄",

Assuming these side effects continue in intensity as I graduate to 50 and 60mg, will they wear off eventually as my body gets used to the medication?

        "text": "Or more specifically, the things you do to manage your ADHD can also be very valuable skills that neurotypical people never bother to learn. I'm a bioinformatician -- a biologist by undergraduate training working on my PhD in bioinformatics.\n\nI will start by saying that doing a PhD with ADHD is **hard**. It was especially hard because I was diagnosed during my second year. I started out doing my PhD in Microbiology, I had to switch labs, I very nearly had to drop out of the program. ADHD made planning and organizing wet lab work at the level required in a PhD almost impossible for me.\n\nNow that I'm in bioinformatics, the tone has completely shifted. I'm currently working on going through the source code for my lab's old software so I can take over its development. My advisor mentioned that I should add documentation here or there if it's missing anywhere. \n\nBut personally, because of my attention issues and forgetfulness, I've developed a habit of writing down everything I think as I'm working through a problem, stream of consciousness style. So in addition to adding normal documentation to the code, I've ended up creating a veritable bible of side-documents explaining what each line of the code is doing, why, what issues I think it could cause in certain use cases, ideas about alternative ways of accomplishing the same thing. I have notes tracing how the variables change throughout the code and notes about the information that is and isn't contained in each of the temporary files it writes and deletes throughout its run.\n\nIt's not an inherent trait of ADHD to write everything down, but it's a skill I've developed as I just can't manage to remember anything that's said in a meeting, what I was planning to do yesterday, what I was thinking when I wrote x, but now I can hit ctrl+f and search my notes to find out.\n\nNot an ad but Obsidian is **amazing** for this. They advertise it as creating an \"external brain\" and that's honestly totally how it works for me. I can't rely on my brain; my brain only works in the here and now; my brain only keeps track of the tasks it was assigned in the last five minutes. So I create a brain that works outside of it, and by constantly interfacing with the \"external brain,\" I can approximate the function of a brain with much better long-term storage and much better tracking and managing of its to-do list.\n\nThe really useful thing is that if you do take the time to create that \"external brain\", anyone on your team can use it. It can stay with the development environment long after you graduate and move on. My advisor was super excited about the depth of my notes, so excited he asked me to take over the lab's other big software project as well, which is a huge opportunity and doubles my publication potential as a grad student. It's the first time I can really say \"my ADHD makes me a great candidate for this job and is really opening doors for me.\"",

        "text": "Hey there! \n\nI'm trying to keep this short, but if I digress, I'm sorry. \nEver since i can remember, I've always had a problem with my executive function. I've been trying to fight against this insurmountable resistance I have to overcome every time I need to do something to the point where I've ran everything I've ever touched into the ground, disappointing myself and others time and time again along the way.\n\nI've just recently figured out that the reason that I've always tried to do something out of the ordinary, something prestigious, was to hide my broken self-esteem behind a facade built by my ego and that by letting go my dreams (or rather, delusions) of grandeur, I could also let go of this unhealthy amount of pressure I've always put on myself both via internal and external sources. \n\nThis realization that I've had about two months ago and its subsequent change in my behavior and my beliefs about myself was unfortunately not really helpful as I've eliminated stressors as much as possible and tried to stick to a healthy routine that doesn't force me to go against my grain, but still keeps me in a state of order versus just vegetating my life away. \n\nToday, I've started reflecting, introspecting, and meditating again on what I'm feeling and where this is coming from. Sure, there's still things I have to do, some more and some less urgent and exhausting, but I'm chipping away at my to-do list bit by bit every day. But every day, almost always between 3-5pm for some reason, I feel roughly the same emotions that I'm feeling right now. It feels like a sort of pressure, a sense of dread, and exhaustion. \n\nOf course, there's still things that I know I need to do. There's still things that I'm scared of doing because they seem so overwhelmingly exhausting, but even if I allow myself to let those things be (as I did for the last two years for one of the tasks specifically) and just focus on everything else, I feel the same. I couldn't even tell you if those things are the cause of the emotions that I feel, or if they just incite a similar feeling.\n\nI can't really do much other than taking care of myself most of the time and, on good days, get a couple of hours of work in. Even on days where I'm motivated, though, this same feeling creeps up around 4-6 hours after I've woken up, and nothing seems to change that. \n\nI've tried several Supplements (as in vitamins, minerals etc.), Vyvanse, Ritalin, Caffeine, Meditation, Cold Showers, Excercise, Therapy, Philosophy (though I'm very new to that) and probably some other things that I'm forgetting right now, but nothing ever seems to work even remotely consistently. I'm exhausted by feeling exhausted. I'm tired of feeling tired. I'm disappointed over the fact that I'm still disappointed in myself. I'm desperate to not feel desperate anymore. I just don't know what else to do. \n\nPlease, if anyone knows anything that might work, I'd highly appreciate it. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of this. Thank you for listening.",

During that time period, my doctor retired.\n Since the pandemic, I've found myself really struggling with staying focused and finishing tasks and I've been wanting to get back on my prescription.\n I'm curious as to whether I'd need to go through the entire process of being diagnosed again or if any new doctor would have access to my previous records of having a prescription?\n \nIf anyone could point me in the right direction about who to see for this kind of thing I'd be grateful!\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi all! I've recently been diagnosed (i'm 28 - female) with ADHD. I've done so, so much research and know about the risks of untreated ADHD with some risks increasing with age. \n\nMy mom never thought about me having any disorders because all these weird things about me were cute, funny stories about how her child is similar to her - and very intelligent (restless - curious - proof of high iq). \n\nKnowing my diagnosis i have no doubt my mom would also get one. She listens to me when I want to share, but refuses to consider this for herself - and frankly also as a thing science agrees upon. Yet she is so clumsy, known for getting silly injuries and getting into harmless traffic crashes. She is getting more scatter-brained and disconnected by the year and admits so herself, but blames this on the stress of the pandemic. She's also nearing 60. I've read research about how ADHD treatment significantly lowers health consequences and delays dementia onset. Should I push my mom about this? How?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL; DR:\n\nMy clearly ADHD mom rejects the idea of ADHD and especially her having it. I worry about the consequences this has for her health and safety. Do i do anything and if yes, what?",

        "text": "Lately I've run into the Adderall shortage. Cue the list of phone calls I had to make just to find which pharmacies in my area have it available. \n\nThe pharmacy staff are consistently sweet at first when I say I'm just checking to see if I can transfer a prescription, and then standoffish and cold once I mention that it's Adderall. \n\nI feel like there's such a stigma around ADHD meds, like I'm faking it or something. Or like I'm a junky looking for my next fix. Meanwhile I always forget to take my pills and take them mainly so I can do basic chores and not quit my job/get fired.\n\nTo me, these are just as essential as when I go to grab an antibiotic. It's a quality of life thing for me, like I literally can't start my day at all if I have my usual amount of executive function. That's led to me having no life whatsoever and struggling to hold a job by age 23. I've only been able to achieve anything since I started getting medicated 3 months ago.\n\nAdderall isn't a magic study drug pill for me. It just allows me to do my job and work consistently, and do chores like laundry or grocery shopping. Plus it helps me not be impulsive so I *don't* turn to any substance abuse, which is ironic when you think about it.\n\nI see a legitimate doctor, I have a legitimate diagnosis, and I legitimately need my meds.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why there is such a stigma around these meds? It's getting ridiculous at this point.",

I even do it at work by giving myself start and end times for tasks. But for the life of me I struggle with food and exercise. I tried doing conqueror challenges and the little ones were good, but anything that’s a “long goal” I just don’t have any motivation to complete.

However, over the last 6 months or so, my symptoms have gotten very bad. A family member who has this type of neuropathy is telling me it's my medication and that I need to stop it. I went to see the doctor about my symptoms, who is aware I take Evanse, and he didn't even suggest it could be my meds causing this and has referred me to a neurologist - waiting times are extremely long. \n\nSymptoms include -\nNumbness in fingers, toes, arms, and random areas of skin\nTingling\nCramps in arms, feet, calves, toes\nHeavy limbs, feels like I'm dragging myself around\nToes starting to turn blue despite them not feeling cold\nNo feeling in feet or hands, really difficult to know how much pressure I need to grip, can't feel textures properly, struggle determing temperatures of things, cannot tell if my washing is damp\nMuscle weakness - if carrying things, I suddenly feel like my hands and arms will give way\n\nThis isn't all my symptoms, but they are the main ones. I personally do not think it's Elvanse related, but I'm getting frustrated with this person brushing my symptoms off, most daily activities are now extremely difficult, and I feel like I am being ignored by this person who is one of my main support networks.",
