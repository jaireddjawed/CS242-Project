        "text": "Hey AskNetsec,\n\n\nFor starters, i've just finished first year of computer science, did very well and I've truly fallen in love with computer security. I've been actively participating in CTFs for ~4 years... \n\n\nSo I had thought that over the summer I'd attempt OSCP. I've done a few OSCP like Vuln Boxes on my own (locally hosted) which went alright. But I struggle completing most of the Hack The Box's machines which has truly crushed my confidence in my ability to start/sign-up and pass OSCP. Im extremely motivated however but Im not sure if id be able to make it. \n\n\nIm currently reading:\nThe Hacker Playbook Practical Guide To Penetration Testing\n\nPenetration Testing A Hands On Approach to Penetration Testing\n\nThe Web Application Hackers Handbook \n\nMetasploit The Penetration Tester's Guide \n\n\nDo you beleive that all things considered I'd have a chance at OSCP? It's also very daunting due to its price tag. \n\n\nSubsequently Im curious to see which certification you guys would recommend instead of OSCP \n\n\nSecurity+, Network+, CompTIA CSA, CASP,\nGCIH, GCFE, GREM, GCFA, CEH, CHFI, CIH, CND\nCISSP, GSEC, CFE, ENCE, CISM\n\n\nAll things considered I'd be applying for a junior position in the security field  (I dream of working as a penetration tester or some form security auditing field) and these junior positions don't typically expect much outside from what you've learned in school, yet value any extra certifications are valued. \n\n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read and give their input. \n\nEDDIT: I've Been working at GeekSquad (BestBuy) for 3 years now and the only other certificate I've earned is the Hardware A+ ",

        "text": "EDIT: Leaving this up in case others find it useful. As suggested by u/grayfold3d, I used a slightly different URL that used existing reports as oppose to scanning the submitted URL as a new record and the results come back pretty much immediately. Thanks everyone for the suggestions.\n\nI was just developing a python script that I was hoping to use to automate some of our IR activities. It takes an ATP safelinks formatted URL and decodes it. Then submits it to the VirusTotal API. However, the API calls at VirusTotal get very low priority and the response is 'Scan request successfully queued, come back later for the report'. The documentation suggests checking in an hour later. So this is basically useless for IR as we certainly aren't going to hang about for an hour waiting for the results when we can get them instantly by entering the URLs manually at the website. So, instead of trashing the whole idea, I'm wondering if there might be some alternative APIs out there that don't require waiting an hour or more to get scan results. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

        "text": "I've been doing some research on information security and it's been suggested in reference to events like Defcon that a person bring burner phones and laptops for these occasions. I'm by no means a computer security expert but I felt that such extreme measure seem excessive and impractical in view of common sense. The purpose of taking such steps is supposedly to mitigate risks, but there seems to be a consensus that modern operating systems like Linux and Android are already fairly secured against being compromised through network connections. Yeah there would be skilled hackers galore at these gatherings, but I've never heard about serious breaches of security at these events that ought to worry the average person, particularly those who frequently update their devices. \n\n*Burner* phones and laptops seem like overkill. The potentiality of base-band hacking on phones is often used to justify this, but that's not something just any attacker would be able to pull off since a high level of technical knowledge and expertise is required to carry out such attacks, or else everyone living in cities would be at constant risk of having their phone hacked. As for laptops, it seems that a thorough wipe and OS reinstall would revert the computer back to a blank slate, discounting BIOS infections and whatnot.\n\nI read that some US government departments and companies like Google mandate their employees to use loaner devices when they traveling to countries like China and Russia on assignments, and then have their devices screened and wiped upon their return. I take this to mean that there *is* at least a significant enough risk factor to warrant caution when actors with advanced cyberwarfare capabilities are involved.\n\nSo, at the end of the day how paranoid should I be about being hacked these days? If I travel to China and Russia should I ditch my phone and laptop afterwards, assuming I'm important enough to be a target? If worst comes to worst could I not just wipe my laptop and reuse it without a lingering fear of being spied upon?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your insights. Like I said I'm not a cybersecurity expert so I'm unable to ascertain for myself how much risk is involved in these cases. The predominant consensus seems to be that caution, to varying degrees, is warranted, though considering the sub this didn't come as a surprise. I'll just trust that you folks are far better versed in these matters than I do, so I should listen to the chorus to stay on the safe side.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm sure this has been asked ad nauseum but after searching I haven't found any answers that match my situation, so I decided to make my own post.\n\n\n**My background:**\n\n\nI'm a 33 year old Lab tech at a small hair analysis laboratory. There's no room for advancement here and I'm capped at salary increases barring cost-of-living raises. Because of this, I went and finished my BS in IT this past December from a state university.\n\n**Work Experience:**\n\n Although my job title is Lab Tech, I have spent quite a lot of time as the de facto help desk clerk. We're a small company and I'm the youngest person by about 20 years, and because I was the guy who knew computers, it therefore became my job to troubleshoot/install/set up all the systems in our office. \n\nPrior to this job I worked in retail, and built up a lot of soft skills in customer service.\n\n\n**Coursework/Projects:**\n\n\nDuring my degree progress I chose a secondary focus on infosec and took classes on digital forensics and network security. During this time I became pretty familiar with analyzing pcaps with Wireshark.\n\nFor my capstone project I set up a very basic homelab consisting of a server and honeypot in my house to try and learn about managing an IDS. Both the server and honeypot were setup with Ubuntu and the IDS we used was Snort, with a Snorby web-based GUI tacked on for monitoring. Remote connections were established with SSH and pen testing was conducted with Kali (another group member did that part). Logs were checked, rules adapted, rinse, repeat until the project deadline.\n\n\nThat brings us to today. All of the above is on my resume, and I applied for a couple Analyst I SOC jobs but got \"thanks but no thanks.\" Since I have a job now, I'm not in a grand rush, and I understand that I'll be starting on the ground floor. \n\nWhat should I do from here? Should I go tackle some certs like Network+ and Security+? CCNA? Would I be able to get a SOC job without them?\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.",

        "text": "Anybody have any information on verifying this as a genuine vuln and then exploiting it? Burp flags it as a high, but can't find much info online\n\n\"It is possible to induce the application to perform server-side DNS lookups of arbitrary domain names.  The payload h1jtpxfwyi3j1a19parlzor76yco0hz5psfg4.burpcollaborator.net was submitted in the SSL SNI value and the HTTP Host header.  The application performed a DNS lookup of the specified domain.  \n\nIssue background\nExternal service interaction arises when it is possible to induce an application to interact with an arbitrary external service, such as a web or mail server. The ability to trigger arbitrary external service interactions does not constitute a vulnerability in its own right, and in some cases might even be the intended behavior of the application. However, in many cases, it can indicate a vulnerability with serious consequences.\nIn cases where DNS-based interactions can be triggered, it is normally possible to trigger interactions using other service types, and these are reported as separate issues. If a payload that specifies a particular service type (e.g. a URL) triggers only a DNS-based interaction, then this strongly indicates that the application attempted to connect using that other service, but was prevented from doing so by egress filters in place at the network layer. The ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to be used as an attack proxy. By submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack other systems that it can interact with. This may include public third-party systems, internal systems within the same organization, or services available on the local loopback adapter of the application server itself. Depending on the network architecture, this may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers.\"",

I end up with a decent amount of time on my hands after work and have been working on this in that free time. The attacker seems to pop sites and place a 6 letter folder onto the site, which tends to contain normally 3 php files and 2 folders, I know this as they left the 6 character folder browseable. These folder names and php files change roughly every 24 hours, as do the compromised servers/sites. \n\nAs of today, the folders are no longer browseable and I find myself lost as to how to approach this research further. At the moment I'm about to request any info the site admin can supply me with regarding what occurred.\n\nI'm writing to try and figure out, as my first investigation outside the perimeter of my workplace, what should I do now? Maybe I'm just wasting my time, I dunno... But I've been on this for roughly a month now...\n\nIf your interested, do a Google search of \"yociew\" and limit it to the last 24 hours for the current daily campaign... Just be careful with the results and maybe use a sandbox? ",

I'd like to be able to create some kind of exclusion to ignore this type of event. Amp offers various ways to create exlusions: Specific Threat, Path (with wild card options), extension, and process. My thought was to make a process exclusion for outlook, but i'm not sure how much that opens me up to ignoring actual malware events. If a user has a malicious attachment in an email and opens it, the activation would be associated with some other process other than outlook, correct? I don't want to do file path because that would really open me up. As would extention and threat.\n\n\n\nDetected Doc.Dropper.Valyria.95.sbx.tg within tmpCB94.tmp (fedc4c62…c403b49f)[Binary Data] .
