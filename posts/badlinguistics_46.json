None of those examples violates standard grammar in any respect.\n\nWell, we all have our little issues, right?\n\nCheck out his reviews: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32S9KH0NRGGB0/ref=cr_cm_rdp_pdp_see_all?ie=UTF8&amp;sort_by=MostRecentReview\n\nAgain and again and again, bitching at grammar or writing books* because they dare use examples that are perfectly correct. I don't even mean \"in dialect\", I mean \"in standard American English\"!\n\nHoly fuck, I've never seen that level of dedication to the cause, and what a stupid cause it is. It's like a whole special level of stupid.\n\n\\* Like it or not, there is some sense in explicitly teaching SAE to students. Many references flub that too, or make the mistake of calling other forms indiscriminately \"wrong\", but....",

        "text": "I was at a sort of group meeting this morning with lots of free discussion which turned to language acquisition. One woman there is of the \"if I say it loudly, I'm right\" type, so I really should have just not started. Anyway, someone says that children raised with two languages always have a delay for the first few years and then catch up. I point out that this is a myth--just because a child has 50 words in language A and 50 words in language B, does not mean they're behind a unilingual child with 100 words in one language.\n\nSomeone offers an anecdote: \"My nephew was raised with English and French and he had a really hard time with language. Then they stopped the French and he was fine.\"\n\nMe: \"He may have struggled with language regardless. Second languages don't cause aquisition problems.\n\nLoudmouth: \"Well, I know LOTS of families with parents that spoke different languages and their kids always had delays. They'd just glom on to one language for a bit, then around four or five, start picking up the other language. Not just English and French, you know. Asian too. Asian is much harder to learn, unless, you know, the mother speaks it. Then the kid just babbles away in it until the come to school.\" [Here I should mention that Loud Lady is married to a man from Singapore.]\n\nI did try a couple times to point out problems with this, but she just talked over me and I shut up. The rest is bullet form, rather than conversation, due to the fact it was basically a monologue.\n\n- It's too much to expect of kids to learn two languages at once and just ends up confusion them later. It might be easier for them to learn young, but it's not good to start with babies.\n\n- She's fluently bilingual because she can understand French, butt can't speak a word. If she were to move to France, she'd probably pick it up easily. [Here I'll point out **WE'RE IN FUCKING QUEBEC AND SHE WAS RAISED HERE!**]\n\n* The most important part of learning a language is understanding it. Speaking really isn't that important.\n\nShortly after this, I left.",

        "text": "The University of Chicago just released their admissions essay questions via email, and one in particular stood out to me:\n\n&gt;In French, there is no difference between \"conscience\" and \"consciousness\". In Japanese, there is a word that specifically refers to the splittable wooden chopsticks you get at restaurants. The German word “fremdschämen” encapsulates the feeling you get when you’re embarrassed on behalf of someone else. All of these require explanation in order to properly communicate their meaning, and are, to varying degrees, untranslatable. Choose a word, tell us what it means, and then explain why it cannot (or should not) be translated from its original language.\n\nAt least they acknowledge that these words must be translatable to some extent, or they wouldn't be able to define them to us, but they still perpetuate this bullshit about untranslatability, including the use of a German noun compound as an example of a single, untranslatable word, which isn't really fair.\n\nOf course, I have other options for questions to answer for the UChicago supplement, including such gems as \"What's so odd about odd numbers?\" and \"Were pH an expression of personality, what would be your pH and why?\" (Those aren't really relevant to this subreddit, but I just wanted to vent.) And I thought the Common App questions were bad! With essays this shitty I'm not sure I even want to apply to UChicago.",

One, is that \"he\" and \"she\" are markers of being human and not gendered pronouns. The second, kinder way, is that \"he\" and \"she\" are only gendered pronouns when discussing humans. Either way.....wtf? I can't even...\n\nWait, there's more! Bring on the French explanation of English grammar:\n\n&gt;Maybe I didn't explain well enough.
