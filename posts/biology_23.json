My first thought was that the flat foot must have been the one squished against the leg when I was born, but after hearing from my parents that my dad has flat feet and my mom has arched feet, I’m starting to wonder if it could be an X-inactivation thing, as I’m a female. Google appears to say there are many markers associated with developing flat feet, does anyone know if some of them are on the X chromosome? I’m 25 and just realizing this asymmetry after my first solid six months of working out.",

Ideally, I would be looking for some of these large, atlas or encyclopedia-type books containing photographs or perhaps drawings to best envision the matter at hand. Anything regarding these plants/trees/flowers interaction with their ecosystem, attached symbolism, traditional/artisabal uses or medicinal properties would be welcome.\n\nI am of course not expecting anything exhaustive and though i'm broadly interested on the topic, I'd be satisfied in having references more specifically focused on the vegetal kingdom from temperate ecosystems and/or the central european regions. \n\nIdeally, these books would be available in English or French.\n\nMy apologies if this post doesn't match this subreddits purpose, I simply haven't found another community whose rules and theme appeared more suitable for it.\n\nMany thanks !",

I deal with comp Chem, ligand receptor docking, molecular modeling, combinatorial-parallel synthesis, High throughput screening and other aspects such as ADMET optimization. \n\nWe have about 400 active graduate level chemists and nearly as many allied professional experts (engineers, pharmacists, pharmacologists, grad students, etc) who contribute regularly with both answers and explanations to inquiries.\n\nWe occasionally hostReddit talks and share lectures on their projects and specific sub-disciplines. Everything is presented in plain english and broken down into convenient  bite sized sections.\n\nOur amateur and hobbyist chemical community has proved invaluable. They come from Allied related professions such as engineering, biological sciences, life sciences, pharmacy and biochemistry and biomedical fields. Some are autodidacts who have beeen tinkering for decades and are bastions of practical advice.\n\nWe have physicians, clinicians and attorneys in the intellectual property and regulatory fields chime in from time to time. \n\nIt’s a diverse group of curious science aficionados and seasoned professionals with formal education and industry experience: a mix of industry and academic backgrounds. \n\nWe would be honored to have you join us as a member of the r/askchemistry community.\n\nYou’ll learn a lot. Enjoy our frequent sarcastic sassy humor. And likely find a niche were you can shine and share your own experiences with those who are equally passionate about your particular sphere of the bench top.\n\nWe have a few basic common sense rules when it comes do posting, (we tend to take a more liberal stance toward the content of comments etc, and give more leeway). \n\nWe only ban flagrant spammers who are attempting to sell services or third party products. Otherwise, we’ve never had to ban anyone since we began this forum in July 2021. We are growing at &gt; 500 members per month and expect to hit nearly 7,000 by the mid 2023. \n\nFeel free to crosspost anything you think may be relevant. Whether it be a chemistry article review or a popular post from r/DrugNerds or whatever your particular forte may be.\n\nWe don’t discriminate or moderate with a heady hand. as long as the topic is of a scientific nature, it’s fair game. \n\nPhysical, chemical, biological, life sci, pharma, biochemistry, engineering, medicine, even particle physics: they’re all valid and acceptable topics of discussion.\n\nIf you don’t have a question, please post a description or lecture on your particular field of expertise or area of interest. We love to learn from others.\n\nHere’s an example from my particular niche:\n\nI work with analgesics. Searching for less addictive and safer opioid based analgesics at the cutting edge of pain and addiction medicine. \n\nI post a monthly review of some of the latest developments and progress in my field. Novel chemical structures, novel modes of action, and reviews of the historical and conventional literature. This helps to weave a fun and enjoyable narrative of the progress we’ve made in this field over 100 years of systematic chemical and pharmacological investigations in elucidating the structure activity relationships in the opioid classes.\n\nIt is fun to share the milestones, struggles failures, challenges faced by the pioneers of past generations and using the literature to explain their thought process. I find it fascinating how they used rational drug design methodology, sheer determination and a bit of serendipity to solve some of the most vexing challenges facing the field of opioid analgesic research. \n\nThe discovery of morphine in 1805 by a German apothecary’s apprentice was the first time an natural occurring alkaloid was isolated from plant material. It made morphine, the god of Dreams (named after Morpheus), the de facto Prometheus of organic molecules and birthed the modern industrial pharmaceutical industry….almost 220 years ago. \n\nThe world has never been the same. Most of the pharmaceutical industry’s discoveries have saved billions of lives over the centuries. And it all started with a humble isolation from the most controversial of flowers: Papaver somniferum.\n\nSincerely \n\nDeandra\n\nChema Diva of the Distillate Receiva\n\nu/jtjdp\n\nr/askchemistry \n\n[Twitter.com/DuchessVonD](https://Twitter.com/DuchessVonD)\n\n[Patreon.com/oxycosmopolitan](https://Patreon.com/oxycosmopolitan)",

Please let me know as this has been bothering me for days",

        "text": "Is the question of if an organism is living a hard and definitive 'yes' or 'no', or can it be put on a spectrum: some things are more living than others; some things are abiotic and certainly not living, somethings are kinda living (not a definitive yes or no), and some things are definitely living, with other things in between those three states? I am asking this question in regard to another question that a lot of other people ask: *How can life come from non-life?* And I was really wondering whether 'life' or if a being is 'living' is really as clear cut as 'yes' or 'no'. Abiogenesis also influenced my question, since I was wondering if abiogenesis created some form of 'thing' that wasn't fully living, but could change in some way over time to become more 'living'.",
