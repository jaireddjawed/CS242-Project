This just happened yesterday. \n\nI am a supervisor on 1st shift for an employer who regulates/audits another business so we work alongside each other but for different companies. We have a designated parking area that is limited in spots, as does the other company. \n\nOne of our 2nd shift employees came to me at the end of my shift about a vehicle that has been parking in our area that shouldn't be. They apparently confronted the employee who shrugged their shoulders, said 'oh well.' and left for the night. I got a good description of the vehicle and the position this person has within the company. \n\nAs I left for the day, I see the vehicle is once again parked in our designated spots. I park next to them, get the license plate number, and contacted their second shift supervisors about the situation. They take this very seriously because at shift change, if others park in our area, there are not enough spots for our employees. If our employees cannot make it on time due to parking, it can cause delays for operations of the other company. I came in this morning to an email stating that the employee's parking pass has been revoked, and they will no longer be able to drive or park inside the gated/fenced area. I hope they like walking from the far lot in winter.\n\nTLDR: Employee of other company parked where they shouldn't have. I got their parking pass revoked so now they have to walk from a distant parking lot.",

The reason I did this starts with him trying to break up with him on valentines day, which is fine, I do understand if you no longer want to be with someone. But an hour later he says he doesn't want to break up anymore, which was relieving for me. A couple of days go by and he is hanging out with his \"girl bestfriend\", I know this because she was posting it everywhere. When I went to check my messages that day he texts saying we aren't meant to be, so I called him to talk with him about this because the way he texted diddent sound like him. And it was very out of no where. When I go to call him his \"girl bestfriend\" answers says how me and him are done and I need to leave him alone. When I ask to speak with him she says \"I'm his girlfriend now\". A couple more days go by where me and him don't speak to one another, and to mess with him even more I start playing ridiculous songs though Spotify and I connect it to hiss speaker. He then texts me saying how much he misses me. And he calls me, but I end up calling him later instead to figure out what tf he's thinking, and apparently he \"never knew\" that he said any of that and says his \"girl bestfriend\" grabbed his phone and did all of that. But a part of me doesn't believe him because he would always choose hanging out with her instead of me. After he said he missed me I took him back and he said he has blocked her but I still do not know if that's true or not.",

We were 8 ppl sharing a kitchen and bath.\nIt was a pigsty beyond anything I have lived in before or since. Mold and wet towels and carpet in the bathroom. A toilet that most likely hadn't been washed since the fall of the Berlin Wall. I went straight into cleaning mode since I literally could not use that bath with out getting hepatitis.\n\nAs for the kitchen... Well.\nMost of the students ate at the campus cantine so the kitchen saw very little use as the cobwebs in the ceiling attested to. The fridge was filled with various take-out boxes with some growing some rather interesting fungii. The sink was of course filled with old pots for boiling ramen and dirty utensils.\n\nI tried organising a cleaning rotation and it worked... For about 4 days. Seemed everybody loved having a clean bathroom and kitchen, but would do nothing to keep it that way.\n\nI was already looking for alternative accommodations after less tham two weeks in this place and the final straw came when on of the other students had a bunch of friends over for dinner.\n\nEverything was dirty and soiled. Trash everywhere and they had even kindly placed dirty pots an pans back into cupboards with out even washing them.\n\nI went to the store. Bought a 10 pack of eggs and proceeded to hide them various placed around the kitchen deep in cupboards and drawers and one on the top shelf in the bathroom and then I moved out. \n\nI will always wonder how long it took before the eggs rotten enough and how long they lived with the smell before somebody started to actually clean",

        "text": "At my last job, my boss (let‚Äôs call her K) hated me. She turned everything into a competition; she mocked me publicly; she took credit for my work; she divulged my personal medical information in front of all our coworkers. She was cruel, and needless to say, I avoided her as much as I could. \n\nSo, now that the stage is set, here‚Äôs the context. End of 2020, corona virus blazing, I had just had my first baby. I was a nervous wreck my entire pregnancy, working from home and being extra careful. After maternity leave (which was disgustingly short btw), I had returned to the office with some precautions set in place. My boss became crueler to me over those first few weeks back, and suddenly announced that, regardless of any negative feelings toward it, she had decided we all had to attend this training in another state. Keep in mind that there were mandatory 2 week at-home quarantines in place for anyone coming back to my state, but my boss fully planned on ignoring those quarantines and demanding we all would return to the office as soon as we got back. \n\nI was carrying a heavy workload and pulling a lot of the weight around the office, and I had some rank. So, I felt fully comfortable expressing my deep concerns to K, telling her that it was peak covid season, and that I had a newborn to worry about now. I expressed I simply didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going in the middle of a global pandemic and asked if there was a remote training I could attend instead. She firmly, ADAMANTLY insisted there was no remote training, and informed me that I could quit if I was that upset with her decisions. It‚Äôs important to note that she insisted this for weeks, even claiming to have contacted the training organization to make sure. I decided on the spot after that meeting that I would be quitting. But I needed to check my boxes first, which took me a few weeks to figure out. \n\nSome time after this meeting and her incessant insistence that there was no remote training, it finally occurred to me to check with the organization putting on the training and ask them to clarify if there truly was a remote training or not. I did, and lo and behold, there WAS - and they had been offering it for months. I asked them to email this information to me. \n\nNow to figure out how to use this valuable information, right? Wrong. As soon as I stepped back into the office, K starts fake-empathizing with me out of nowhere, in front of all our coworkers. saying she really wished she didn‚Äôt need to force me to go to this training. So, I said, ‚Äúif you feel so bad, let me go to the remote training.‚Äù She looked at me in surprise, and her face turned beat red. Before she could fight me, I pulled up the email with the information and read it aloud in front of all our coworkers. No one said anything, they just stared, wide-eyed at her while she blubbered like a fool. \n\nLong story short, after pulling that fast one on her, I pulled her into a private meeting a gave my notice. She was horrified because, as I stated prior, I carried a lot of the work around the office. \n\nBut, like she said, I could quit if I didn‚Äôt like her decisions ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nETA: a lot of people are asking why I didn‚Äôt throw her under the bus. There are a lot of details I‚Äôm not including for anonymity. I was actually scared for my safety at one point. I might make a post on another subreddit about how she stalked me. Unfortunately, a lot of these occurrences would not have held up when brought to the higher ups due to varying circumstances. If they did hold up, I was actually pretty scared of retaliation, even outside of the workplace. I was afraid to poke the bear too much. Sorry to be vague, but again, aiming for complete anonymity.\n\nFurther, for everyone asking about why she was insisting we attend in person, I uncovered two reasons:\n\n1. She had a personal reason to be in the city that training was in. She was hoping to get her way paid by the company to go. \n2. She knew it would inconvenience and scare me. And that she could dangle her ‚Äúpower‚Äù over me.",

        "text": "This story comes from my previous job, about 5 years ago. So, I have to preface this with the fact that I have a health condition that pops up on an unpredictable but occasional basis. It means that I'm not able to drive, but can still usually work fine from home.\n\nI was working as an engineer, not in my field, but in a sort of general work management position. When I got the job, it has originally started as very self contained, and I was the only staff member in a very small but necessary area. No one told me when I started that there would be out of hours work at home, but my manager and I came to a basic agreement that I'd do the occasional out of hours work, and they'd let me work from home when my health required it.\n\nSkip forward a couple of years, and while the company was never great to work for, I had pretty much been left alone. My fellow colleagues, on the other hand, had it rough. New management had come in, decided that they didn't need local people to do the work and fired most of them (despite the fact that most of management was FIFO for some reason). \n\nAnd so our fly in HR rep decided that I was no longer allowed to work from home, due to 'the liability if I fell over and broke my leg at home'. I told him that I would no longer be able to do the out of hours work either, and he simply said I'd have to come into the office to do it.\n\nSo I went job hunting. A mate of mine reached out with a job in my field, and I got it. I gave my two weeks notice, over Christmas. So instead of having two weeks to train my replacement, I had one due to the Christmas shutdown. And there was nobody left in the business who knew what I did, I'd been on such a rotating suite of managers that barely knew I existed, and my current manager was leaving the same time I was.\n\nOh, and did I mention that I'd been taking on extra duties aside from my initial job? This being the kind of company that just heaps stuff on people, I'd ended up with additional work from other areas. I didn't train anyone in this, as they didn't provide anyone for me to train (this was a very common phenomenon in this business, not bothering with handover). \n\nI happily jaunted off to my new job, which I'm still in and love, but I have friends still with the company, and so I kept up on the gossip. My replacement couldn't keep up with my original job, and kept texting me for about a year for advice on how to do it. They ended up employing 3 other people to deal with it, plus all the other tasks I'd acquired.",

        "text": "First i have to say, i'm not from the US and English is not my first language so please bare with me, i'll do my best. TLDR at the end.\n\nA couple years ago, i was working with a placement agency. ( you tell them what kind of job you can do and what salary you expect and they find you something). They found me a great job 15 minutes from my home, 3 days off/week and 22$/h. (19y/o me loved it)\n\nHow this agency worked is that after 3 months the company you are working at, are obligated by contract to hire you. \n\nIt was a fence factory so it was REALLY loud, so loud that when you go outside, your ears start ringing. It was also kind of dangerous because the forklift drivers always had earphones on. I also never saw anyone with safety googles on. You get the idea, there was a lot of safety issues.\n\nSo for 2 months and 30 days, i went to work everyday, on time, never missed a day and even put in my name do to some overtime on saturdays. Everything seems to be fine, i had good feedback from others employes telling me i was a fast learner and had potential. \n\nOne day, OSHA (its an other name here but lets call it OSHA for the story) came in to do a suprise visit. However, the entrance in the front is lock so by the time the boss opens them the door, he had the time to tell us to put on our safety glasses and ear plugs (i didnt even knew we had some). So OSHA make their inspection and went on their way, everything was how they wanted it. As soon as the door closed, everyone took off their glasses.\n\nOk so at the end of that 30th day, my boss ask me if he can talk to me in his office before i go for the week-end. He told me that today was my last day and didnt gave me a reason why, even told me that i was a good employe. The way he talked, i had the feeling that he didnt like me personally so that was it. The agency call me couples of minutes later telling me that i will no longer work there and asked me if i knew why because normally, they give a reason why.\n\nSo now its my time to be petty. I called OSHA and told them about how unsafe it is there and how they basically put on a show when the inspectors were there. I told the guy on the phone that if the inspector go in the employes parking lot, there's a door that goes directly into the factory and that door is unlock. He thanked me and that was it.\n\n2 or 3 weeks later, i had to drive by the place (it was during the day so it's supposed to be open) and when i looked, there was no car in  the parking lot and the windows in the front office were boarded up. \nI could not believe it worked so quick. \n\nIt's been roughly 7 years since and the place looks like its been abandonned for years.\n\nThank you for reading me, i hope it wasnt too complicated to understand.\n\nTLDR: My boss fired me so no reason so i called OSHA and they close the place down because it was not safe enough.",

He got so mad he decided to find a loophole in his contract and get decades of petty revenge.\n\nEvery couple of decades, he makes a no-budget 20-some minute tv special where he complains to Leonard Maltin while wearing his old costume, and releases it unannounced in the middle of the night on TCM. This week, at 85 years old, he premiered his new one, called Dick Tracy Zooms In. He didn't even have to show up on set. However, he has gone to court to make sure that they legally count as sequels, and thus renew his rights to the character. He does this solely so that no one else can legally use the character for anything.\n\nThis new special will make the character his until 2027, when Dick Tracy goes into the public domain and anyone can use him for free.\n\nThis is art. This is some A+ Andy Kaufman-level trolling. I will never watch either of these specials, because the whole point is that they are unwatchable, low effort, and awful enough to be a middle finger to some bean counting whipper snapper who made Warren Beatty mad in the 90s. But I am so happy they exist. I'd rather know these bird flips by an old man taking a grudge to the grave are in the world than a Dick Tracy Disney+ show starring Chris Pratt.\n\nSource: Ryan Estrada fb and https://collider.com/warren-beatty-dick-tracy-rights/",

Well sucks to suck ig but he cheated on me with this girl let's call her P(19F). So P had a younger brother D(M18?). D was my ex's best friend and helped him cheat without getting caught god knows how many times. D was actually obsessed with me and that's the main reason he wanted me to breakup with my then bf. He was the one who helped them and later came up to me and told me everything about how my ex never loved me and he just dated me because I'm pretty and he wanted to appear cool etc etc. Man saying I was mad is an understatement. After I discussed the matters with my ex and P they told me that it was actually D who encouraged them to sneak up behind my back. After all this shit, D started to act all lovey dovey with me and I,too,gave him signals that I liked him. Guy was all in love and he proposed me infront of everyone on valentine's day and guess who got rejected? He was real upset(I mean ofc) and started crying. My ex and P called me an asshole for breaking his heart but meh should've thought about this earlier. I actually hate all three of them equally and even if I know D 'encouraged' them one excuse is stupid bcz they are not little kids but whatsoever all well that ends well(for me atleast). This was the story of my petty revenge.",

        "text": "Today while exercising at the gym colored purple and yellow. I ran into a privileged beta male, I'll call him Kevin. Kevin disturbed my and two others' workouts. I have seen Kevin at the gym for about 4 months now. He doesn't rerack his weights and wipes down equipment after using them. \n\nAnyway back to the story. If you have not been to the gym full of anti-judgment there is an area designated for circuit training with the designated color yellow to separate them from the other purple equipment. There are 25 workout stations mixed with body weight and machine-based workout equipment in this area, which are clearly numbered 1 to 25. Members should follow this circuit route and avoid using the equipment like others on the main gym floor. This is also mentioned by a sign that is placed before the entrance to the area.\n\nOur anti-judgment-free gym pretty much follows these rules for the area with the exception, of the unspoken rule \"If all of the specific machines you are trying to use are taken on the floor and you see no one actively doing a circuit, you can use one that particular machine in the yellow zone.\" You see Kevin broke both the written rules and unspoken rules of the gym.\n\nKevin sat down at station 23 while I was at station 20 followed by two other gym members behind me. As I was leading the pack I noticed Kevin using the leg press machine. I kept moving through stations 21, 22, and now 23. Before confronting Kevin, I looked around and saw all of the leg press machines were open on the main floor. I stood in front of him and he gave me a blank stare like he didn't study for an exam. I asked him \"Why are you doing sets in the circuit area? You are messing up the rotation.\" He looked embarrassed and apologize. Saying he was going to finish this last set before getting up. As he was finishing the light turned colors indicating the new rotation has started. I said, \"Fuck this you are taking too slow and I went to the main floor to do that station.\" He gave me a blank stare as I took off. This basically happen two more times with the others following me in the rotation.\n\nBasically in short my Petty Revenge was \"I talked to a dude during his mid-set and called him slow before running off pointing out all of the extra leg press machines on the main floor. \" The best part was that he got told he was slow by a 375-pound guy.",

        "text": "I worked at Hickory Farms store when I was 16, as a \"Cheese Ball Boy\", making cheese balls. You cut a 40 pound block of cheese with a wire device that looked like a garrotte, measured out a piece weighing a pound on a scale, and then made the cheese ball. To make it, you formed it into a ball about the size of a softball, rolled it around in a big container of crushed nuts, put a cherry on top, wrapped it in cellophane, and put it into a box labelled with the type of cheese you used.\n\nMy manager was a woman in her mid twenties named Lois, who was a very attractive blonde, with a fun personality. Not only did the customers enjoy her, but the three or four high school boys working for her did also, and would do anything she asked them, like little puppies. She also allowed us to eat the beefs ticks that were sold there, further cementing our loyalty. \n\nOne day there was a totally dickish customer who complained there weren't enough crushed nuts on the cheeseball he bought the day before. Lois ignored the fact that a quarter of his cheese ball had been eaten off, and was told that the ones in the refrigerated display were also a bit light on nuts according to the customer when she offered to swap it for a new one. So she told him she'd go in the back and have a fresh one made up, with lots of crushed nuts. \n\nShe came back and told me what she needed. Luckily I was only half way through a new 40 pound block of cheese, and I made the cheese ball with some extra nuts and brought it out to her when it was finished. I saw her present it to the customer, who said in a very condescending tone, \"I thought you said you were going to add MORE nuts. She smiled and told him she'd be right back. \n\nIn the back, she told me to make another one, but since I was loading it up with lots of crushed nuts, to weight out only 12 ounces of cheese or it wouldn't fit in the box. She stood by the container of crushed nuts while I weighed out the new one, and when I turned to walk it to her, she said, \"Just bowl it to me.\" So I rolled it across the floor to her, and watched her move it around in the nuts, place the smaller cheese ball on top of the cellophane wrapper that already had a big pile of nuts on it, and then wrap the cheeseball with all the nuts that were only held in place by the cellophane around the cheeseball. Size-wise it looked like a standard cheeseball, but it clearly had a shitload of nuts around it. As soon as it was unwrapped the extra nuts were going to fall out. She popped a cherry on top before sealing the cellophane, grabbed a empty cheeseball box, and walked it out to the customer.\n\nHe approved, and left the store with with his \"special\" cheeseball. As I was leaving at the end of my shift, she told me not to say anything about what we had done.",

        "text": "TLDR: our upstairs neighbors boyfriend decided to bring our child into our feud, he is now getting kicked out of the apartment and we annoyed him into being silent by out noising him. \n\n\n\nLong story short our upstairs neighbor let her boyfriend move in with her, he seems to be at most about 18 years old, every single night since he has moved in he has either called the cops or complained to the landlord that we were making too much noise, mind you most of the times of these complaints we were all literally asleep. So we decided to start filing noise complaints back as they are MUCH louder and constantly waking our toddler up. We tried our best to keep the noise down but we really have never been that loud and the prior tenants never had an issue with us, neither did the woman upstairs till her boyfriend moved in.\n\n\nYesterday was the final straw, our landlord told us to let him know if their dogs were making too much noise, after listening to their dog yip for 3 hours straight, I decided to say something. Lone behold about 20 minutes later the cops are at MY door, saying there was a complaint my child had been crying for hours, mind you my child hadn‚Äôt cried all day. So they ask to see my daughter, I show them my toddler who is clearly content and clearly has not been crying at all and they go on their way.\n\n\nMoments later boyfriend upstairs comes stomping as loud as he can inside saying ‚Äúyou wanna say that I make too much noise!‚Äù And yelling and swearing at us through the floor, we made countless attempts to get him to come downstairs but he refuses and begins blasting music as loud as he can.\n\nWe record all of this and send it to our landlord. And then decided to be petty. We get our toddler away from the loudness. My boyfriend is very into music and audio production and so we have a really high quality and really LOUD sound system. We proceed to play music as loud as we can once our baby is protected from the sound which very much drowned out what he was playing. After we stopped he was silent and his girlfriend shortly after got home and commenced screaming at him for being how he was. (He is very abusive toward her and we can hear him screaming and throwing things at her all the time, dude is an overall piece of shit)\n\nThe icing on the cake is that today the landlord is coming over to tell him that he needs to move out asap and is no longer allowed on the property. Overall a huge win for us.",

Needless to say I don‚Äôt like them and am leaving after 6 months since they found a girl to take my room they can torment. \n\nThis week I move out, the past few weeks they have been just tossing whatever they can at my door, making a ‚Äòpoint‚Äô to show how they don‚Äôt value my things or by how I‚Äôm not welcomed in the house. ( I really should make a post to explain the back story because it shows you how crazy these 2 are but idk where I would even post this) I share a bathroom with the girl I met at work, when we first moved in together she complained that she hated the shower curtain rod and had me go across town to buy a new curtain rod. I am excited because for the next few days I plan to take the rod as I leave. She had a pretty regular schedule of showering middle of the day before work ( we work as servers so we work 4 pm to night) I‚Äôm excited for after I move completely out I also take the shower curtain I bought all those months ago. This is quite possibly the most lame thing I‚Äôve ever done but I am so so so excited to do it. Along with a few other small petty things.",

However I appreciate people want to talk about up to date things, and accept that it's going to be a part of life.\n\nHowever, one day several years ago, I came across a spoiler for something that had literally just come out (within 24 hours) on a Doctor Who fan page which had no spoiler warning, with the spoiler unavoidable even if you just scrolled past. I had been lucky enough to watch it live that week, but often was unavailable to watch them straight away due to life. \n\nI asked them to put a spoiler warning on it, and quickly got harassed and told if I didn't want Spoilers to 'leave the fan page' and 'not go on the internet'.\n\nEveryone has their own opinions but these 2, shared by several people, in particular incensed me.\n\nI noted that some of the people with these opinions lived in the USA whilst I was then in the UK, and at the time, BBC America showed the new Doctor Who at a later time to the UK.\n\nThe next week I watched the episode as soon as it came out, wrote down the main bits of the show, and messaged them a synopsis of that weeks show.\nI did the same the next week as well.\nAnd don't worry, this was to Brits as well as Americans.\n\n2 people blocked me, 2 didn't read it at all, 1 person replied calling me names, and the final person replied saying they'd already watched it but good try. \n\n3/6 ain't bad.\n\nI'd have felt bad of course sharing spoilers but, as they told me, if they didn't want Spoilers they should have just 'not gone on the internet'.",

While there, I had had grabbed their amazing $1.50 hotdog and drink combo and mixed iced tea and lemonade together. This is important later. \n\nWe got off the freeway and I had to stop for a red light on the off ramp, then immediately caught the next red light off the freeway.\n\nAs I was waiting for the light and talking to my wife, a little biscuit bounces off the hood of my car. I look to my left, and there is a guy in a pickup with his window rolled down, throwing biscuits out of a bag at my car.\n\nI roll down my window and ask wtf. He says I made him brake hard at the light before, and I should have just driven through. I said the light was red moron, that's how shit works. I'm sure not running a red light because some dumbass isn't paying attention.\n\nHe throws another biscuit at my car. So I grab my drink.\n\nI'm right handed and my car (newer Carmaro) has tiny windows. So I didn't have much hope on my accuracy throwing this out the window with my left hand. And this was obviously a work truck. Really doubtful he'd care if he got a drink on the outside of this truck.\n\nBut I put my faith in the Most High and threw that drink. He watched it fly through the air totally nonplussed, until it went right through his passenger window and exploded inside his truck. Luke Skywalker didn't feel as accomplished making that shot though the exhaust port as I did seeing an Arnold Palmer erupt all over his cloth seats.\n\nHe immediately started searching his truck for something else to throw and I floored it, laughing as loudly as I could out my window.",

        "text": "Read a story on here about getting revenge on a previous employer, and it reminded me of a shop I worked at. \n\nI was an automotive technician for a decade. Went to college for a major automotive manufacturer, learning specifically on their models. But, it got boring quick. I love off reading, so after graduating I found what I thought would be an awesome job at a local offroad shop. \n\nThe company had been in business for a long, long time, and was kind of known in my city as the place to go for Jeep and offroad upgrade and repairs. I was initially hired as a shop helper, with the understanding that I would learn some of the more difficult things like welding, installing gears and other more niche skills. \n\nThe shop was owned by a very religious man. When I interviewed, he went on and on about his faith, his work through his church with charities and on mission, and how pure he was having never drank in his life and rarely cursed. \n\nThe first few months went well, but after a while I brought up the fact that I did have some knowledge and that I didn‚Äôt want to be sweeping floors, changing oil and wasting time. I wanted to further myself as a technician. This is when the owner showed his true colors, verbally berating me in front of the rest of the staff, calling me ungrateful and stupid for thinking I would be any better. \n\nBeing the naive 21 year old I was, I put up with it. I stuck around, and eventually got moved to another part of the shop. As a sort of side business, this shop has signed up with a national interlock company. Interlocks are devices installed in a car, when you receive a DUI. Also known as a blow and go. Get in, turn your car on, blow into the device and once it determines your sober, it allows the car to start.\n\nI did this portion of the business for almost a full year. Pretty simple, installing the units, doing the monthly calibration and download of data, and removing the units when the person had completed the terms of their sentence. \n\nJust before Christmas, me and the other guy who did the installs were called into the office at the end of the day. No sugar coating, this man looked us dead in the eye and said he was laying us off, and discontinuing his relationship with the interlock company. We were shocked, especially with how nonchalant an arrogant he was about it. He told us to pack out things and he‚Äôd have our final checks to us by the end of the week. Since I was a technician, I had a full rolling tool chest and tool cart. I asked if i could have a few days to pick up a trailer to get my tools out, which he was surprisingly fine with. \n\nI went home, broke the news to my family, and started my search for a job. I was laid off on a Monday, so Wednesday I picked up a trailer from my dad, and went to get my tools. I stepped into my old workspace, to find a member of the interlock company training someone on how the interlocks work and how to install and work with them. \n\nI got a moment with the interlock employee, and asked him what‚Äôs up. He said the owner laid us off, and replaced us both with a single person. I went about my business, loaded all my stuff, then went in to collect my final check. \n\nI stewed over it the entire time I was loading my stuff. Surprisingly, the new guy came over to see what I was doing. We talked about the job and the installs. Then, an idea popped into my head. Nonchalantly, I asked the guy what he‚Äôd been hired at, wage wise. I want surprised to find that he‚Äôd been hired at a  significantly lower hourly wage than me ($7-8 an hour if memory serves). When I found out, I made sure to let him know, and told him personally, he‚Äôd be insane to do the job for what he‚Äôd been hired at. \n\nHe looked extremely shocked when I told him my wage, and excused himself. A few minutes later, as i was strapping down my tool box, he came walking out, got in a car, and left. Right on his heals was the owner. He came absolutely unglued at me. I‚Äôve never seen such a string of profanity from and employer, ripping me apart verbally for making his new hire quit on the first day. I just laughed, said gee, I guess my work here is done, got in my truck and drove away. A few days later I called the interlock representative, and asked him to keep me in the loop as to whether they ever get anyone to replace us. It took them almost 6 months to find a new install tech. Very satisfying. \n\nTLDR: got laid off, found out I was being replaced at a lower wage, and sabotaged my replacement.",

He pull out a mobile heater that can really heat up a room and it allows me to wake up warmer on cold mornings. It works so i agreed. \n\nI was satisfied but not mom.

As for me I‚Äôm comfortable in my heated room while mom and dad fight over keeping the extra blankets. So I guess this revenge is from me and mom as well.",

        "text": "At my apartment complex we have to pay $50 per month for valet trash service, where you set your trash out at night and garbage men pick it up and take it to the dumpster. Well these garbage ‚Äúmen‚Äù are mostly teens who don‚Äôt care about their job or even common decency. They often are spilling trash, kicking our bins around and at times even skipping whole buildings altogether. \n\nThe first time valet trash skipped my building, I got fined 40 bucks by the landlord for leaving my trash out overnight. Mind you this is in Florida where the trash is rotting in the heat from the moment it‚Äôs set out. I told the landlord it‚Äôs not my fault that their garbage men skipped my building, and they told me to ‚Äútake it up with the trash company‚Äù because it‚Äôs a third party and therefore not the complex‚Äôs fault.\n\nWell one night, I hear the trash men break a rather large bottle of wine. It‚Äôs loud and I hear them swearing and trying to sweep up the glass. Come to find out the next morning, they had dumped all of the broken glass into MY tiny (single garbage bag size) bin, and it wasn‚Äôt even my bottle that they broke! My trash bin was half full of shards of glass, rendering it useless and also dangerous. Was I supposed to dispose of the garbage men‚Äôs own mess, who I pay to do that very service?! Absolutely not. So I dumped the mountain of broken glass into the hallway before taking in my bin. It wasn‚Äôt mine and I didn‚Äôt break it, after all. The funny thing is, the only other unit in my hallway is the tour unit, right across from me. So when potential new tenants came to check out the place, a pile of glass shards and sticky, foul smelling red wine stains awaited them. Right in front of the door. \n\nA day later the landlord not only had to come clean up the mess from their ‚Äúthird party company‚Äù that THEY HIRED, they removed the company mats from in front of the tour unit and it is no longer open for touring. üòä",

        "text": "tl;dr: Older brother was picking on me and my younger brother, outsmart him into drinking a sabotaged drink.   \n\n\nA long long time ago, in the days of my young childhood I had three siblings. Younger brother \"Billy\", 3 years younger than me. Older brother \"Bob\", 3 years older than me. And older sister \"Thornton\" (who is uninvolved in this story except that she was present, which is why I don't mind dubbing her \"Thornton\" to complete the naming), 5 years older than me.   \nI forget the exact year, and thus my exact age, but I estimate I was about 7, which would make my brothers 4 and 10.   \n\n\nEvery Sunday my family went into the city to have a family dinner with our Nanny and Pop-Pop (father's parents, immigrated from the old country before he was born.) Every Sunday this amazing homemade Italian meal with proper Italian gravy (read: meat sauce), the kind that took like 4-5 hours to make. The food was always incredible, the usual drink was this very weak (watery) lemonade.   \n\n\nSo one day my older brother was picking on me and Billy. Nothing major, just being a bit of a mean jerk to us. Again, we were little kids, and this wasn't anything super bad, not even enough to get him scolded by our parents or grandparents, maybe just a \"stop picking on your little brothers.\" Atmosphere is generally light at the table, he was just picking on us. Especially my little brother, and specifically doing a whole \"I'm older and smarter than you,\" sctick about everything.   \n\n\nI wish I had a sharper memory of how he was picking on us... but no one in my family remembers exactly what he was doing. Because the aftermath is what has become one of \"those family stories\" that people remember years later.   \n\n\nI decide Bob needs to pay, so with Billy needing a drink refill, and Bob's glass low as well, I volunteer to go to the kitchen with Billy to get them both refills. Bob smells a trap coming. He makes a comment to me, but kind of publicly to the whole table, that he knows we're going to do something to his drink.  \nMe, with 7 year old overacting: \"I would NEVER!\" /mock outrage. He just rolls his eyes, makes it clear he's not going to fall for anything. He's 10, we're just little kids. He's older and smarter than us, we can't put anything past him.   \n\n\n...ha!  \n\n\nSo in the kitchen, I speak quietly to Billy and try to get him to quiet down as we refill the two glasses. Then I put a big pour of salt into one glass, and a bit of pepper into the other. The pepper floats very clearly on top of the one, and you obviously can't make out the salt in the other. Billy can't hold in his giggles, but that's okay. We can hear from the dining area Bob commenting out Billy's laughing and how we're obviously doing something.   \n\n\nBilly's like 4. He couldn't keep a straight face if you taped his mouth into a straight line. I whisper to him the plan:   \n\"Okay, Billy, here's what you do. DON'T say anything, just take the drinks out and put THIS one (pepper glass) in front of Bob, and take THIS one (salt), to your seat. Just don't drink from it, and don't say ANYTHING.\"   \nBilly takes the two drinks out, trying his absolute best to keep a straight face and keep quiet, and of course utterly failing. He does as I said while I go back to my own seat.   \n\n\nThere's a short beat while Bob looks at his glass of lemonade, with little flakes of black pepper floating in it, and Billy sitting across from him trying to keep his lips glued shut (\"don't say anything\") but nonetheless smiling and giggling through pressed lips. I'm trying to keep a straight face, but I'm probably smiling a little, not that he'd notice next to Billy's 4 year old utter lack of control.   \n\n\nBob: \"Yeah, nice try.\" And he reaches across the table to swap with Billy's glass, and takes a full drink from it.   \n\n\nThe reaction is immediate, he nearly spits the drink out mid-swallow, and starts coughing like crazy. Billy and I start laughing openly. Our parents and sister start losing it as well, laughing like crazy. Full on can't-catch-your-breath laughing. Even our generally stoic Pop-pop laughs a bit. The only ones not laughing are Bob (naturally), and our Nanny who at first was alarmed, and then kind of lost as to what just happened. I happily share our whole plan of \"He was suspecting something, I knew Billy wouldn't be able to keep a straight face, so gave him something to 'find' in the pepper-glass so he'd fall for the actual trap: salt-glass.\" After that she was just upset, kept going on about how she couldn't believe \"Brothers would do that to each other.\" But our parents were laughing, and even Bob took it in good enough humor after he calmed down. (Found out through our parents some time later, upon a retelling of this story, that our Nanny was more 'upset' about this than we realized and thought we, or I at least, should be punished more. But parents weren't going to punish us over a harmless prank. Especially when they were kinda on our side after telling Bob to \"stop picking on your younger brothers\" multiple times.)   \n\n\nAfterwards we rinsed out the glasses and got some fresh, untampered lemonade. I still had to take a sip from his glass before he would though.",

For 1) ADHD actually comes in handy and added to being smart I picked things up quickly and was often able to do a days work by lunch so I kinda goofed off until bosses found other work for me to do. As for 2) my father also worked for the company and gave me the password so I wouldn‚Äôt have to come to him every 15 minutes.    So I did have his permissions to use the password.\n\nNow here is where the revenge part comes in.  The boss that fired me actually asked me to train my replacement.   My father who remember worked for the company as well said yea because it meant two more weeks of pay as he started to send out my resume.   As I trained my replacement I realized how much I actually did beyond Emmy job description because the girl I trained could not keep up.   After I finally left my father told me my boss had to hirs two more people just to replace me.    \n\nOh yeah a month later my father quit to.\n\nThe place I work got bought out six months later.",

        "text": "for context, i don't live in the US or the UK. this happened during high school, which takes 6 years to finish. \n\nduring our fourth year, a couple of students were chosen to go to a trip to southern England where we'd travel around the area by bus. me and my friends had a pretty good time, sitting in the middle section close to the door so we could both participate with the shenanigans of the popular kids in the back and the more reserved kids in the front. obviously there was a lot of (loud) music played through a bluetooth box. \n\nenter my first interaction ever with the ass of this story. for simplicity's sake i'll call him Mike. i don't know whether he was the owner of the box, but when we had to leave the bus, arriving at our destination, he was holding it. like i said, me and my friends sat close to the door and he too had to pass our seats to get out. waiting for others to get out he stood right next to me.\n\n whilst he was standing there, his (obnoxious) music was playing loudly through the speaker.\n\nright. in. my. ear.\n\nand i mean LITERALLY in my ear. the speaker blasted from about 30 centimeters away and was pointed at me while he was holding it. me quite obviously bothered by this fact wanted this to stop, so i asked him nicely if he could turn it down a bit. Mike didn't even look at me and said \"no.\" just to turn it up a bit louder.\n\n\"okay\" i thought to myself. i had never interacted with this dude before. i didn't know him and he had no reason to do me like that. after this trip i'd probably never interact with him either, so i sucked it up.\n\ni was wrong. dead wrong. because a year later we ended up in the same graduation class. when i saw his face in our mentor group i remembered what he did and i immediately started fuming. i just knew the universe would grant me an opportunity to teach Mike a lesson. so i waited, i waited and i waited some more all the while i was watching this guy be a dick to everyone around him by standing in the middle of hallways refusing to move, cheating during gym class or throwing around slurs like he was a black transgender woman.\n\nnow, here's some background information. in our last year of high school, every major test would count towards our final grade and would have major impact on whether or not we could graduate. Mike was a guy that typically did quite well on exams. as such, he was on track to graduate cum laude. myself personally was in a way a teacher's pet. our mentor adored me (and i adored her) and other teachers generally loved talking to me during break. even teachers i never had class from would interact with me. i'm still in touch with some of them.\n\nwinter of our final year in high school had arrived. we'd have our second to last economics exam before the grand finals. there was some ruckus going on halfway through the exam, but i thought nothing of it. some rumours went on that an exam surveillant had caught two guys cheating, but that's all i had heard from it.\n\nuntil our next economics class.\n\nwhen we were going through the answers of the exams, Mike and another guy were arguing with the teacher that they didn't cheat, were wrongfully accused and were wrongfully awarded a 1/10 on their test. Mike threw a fit and started emailing our mentor immediately whilst the teacher tried to explain that the surveillant followed protocol and that they could retake the exam if they could prove themselves innocent. that being said Mike and his friends immediately went to gather some of their friends to vouch for them during lunch break.\n\nand guess who was sitting behind them then and there as they were talking about what happened? \n\nthat's right. me.\n\ni overheard one guy, Peter, explain to others that Mike and another guy were trading answers since the other guy hadn't studied. the surveillant had caught them and now they needed people to vouch for them that it didn't happen (which it did, Peter admitted)\n\nthat same day i had a chat scheduled with my mentor, who had to investigate the alleged cheating. before i could bring up what i had heard during lunch break she'd asked me if i knew something about it. i spilled all the beans, and she sent a mail to the teacher and school directors AND she got Peter to confirm the story. \n\nMike's 1/10 for economics stayed in his record and ruined his chances to graduate cum laude. i heard him bitch about a \"snitch\" to his friends and that he couldn't believe their betrayal in the hallway, walked up to him and whispered to him: \"you should've turned off the music\"\n\nthen he stopped being an ass to me specifically for the rest of our school year.",

Needless to say I don‚Äôt like them and am leaving after 6 months since they found a girl to take my room they can torment. \n\nThis week I move out, the past few weeks they have been just tossing whatever they can at my door, making a ‚Äòpoint‚Äô to show how they don‚Äôt value my things or by how I‚Äôm not welcomed in the house.

I am excited because for the next few days I plan to take the rod as I leave. She had a pretty regular schedule of showering middle of the day before work ( we work as servers so we work 4 pm to night) I‚Äôm excited for after I move completely out I also take the shower curtain I bought all those months ago.

I (39f then) gained about 50 pounds when I was pregnant. My friend M (55f) had no kids herself so she had no first-hand clue about how some people's bodies can change. M was careful not to say anything directly about my weight. But I could tell how she felt because she made lots of comments about diet &amp; exercise.\n\nI figured I would lose weight breastfeeding, as I had with my other babies -- but they were born when I lived in a different city from M, so she didn't see me in person then.\n\nWhen I went over to M's house before, she used to offer me snacks like chips. But now she started offering me only things like cut veggies with zero-calorie dip. She tried to convince me to go on walks with her, but I was exhausted -- I had to go back to work fulltime &amp; I got enough exercise already, so I almost always said no.\n\nOnce I even spotted some chips in her kitchen and said, \"Can I please get a few of those?\" She said no, those were her husband's so I couldn't have any. Okay, fine -- even though they were never off limits to me before I got fat!\n\nI knew she meant well, but.....after months of her pushing me to \"live healthier\" (meaning, lose weight) I started to get annoyed.\n\nI was already eating healthy &amp; exercising when I could, and the baby weight was indeed coming off from breastfeeding. (NOTE: Breastfeeding is NOT a guaranteed way to lose weight for everyone, but it fortunately was for me.)\n\nI reached a point where I was really tired of M's \"support.\"\n\nSo when she started pushing exercise &amp; nutrition, I told her, \"My body is different from having a baby, and I'm happy the way I am, and I don't see any reason to change myself or my habits.\" She nodded, but.....she still didn't stop.\n\nSo here is where I might be TA.\n\nI started telling her outright that I hadn't lost ANY of the baby weight.\n\nThis was a lie. I had dropped about 15 pounds. Then 20. Then after about a year, when I weaned my son, I had lost it all, and I fit into most of my old clothes -- and I was still saying to M, \"I'm happy the way I am, even at my new weight!\"\n\nAnd M kept going on &amp; on with the diet &amp; exercise talk.\n\nI had stopped finding it annoying at this point, and started finding it funny.\n\nOne day a mutual friend said to M that I was looking good lately after losing weight, and M insisted to her that I hadn't lost any at all.\n\nThe friend pointed out that I was obviously much thinner and she said M probably hadn't seen me lately. But she had just seen me the day before.\n\nSo the next time I met M, she asked, \"DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT AND NOT TELL ME?\" I said, yeah, maybe a bit?\n\nShe thought I was TA for telling her all along that I hadn't lost weight. But I said, \"Come on, you have EYES that work just fine!\"\n\nInstead of noticing me getting thinner right in front of her face, she somehow got stuck in her mindset that I needed \"support\" to be healthier -- and as a result, she looked like a fool in front of at least one mutual friend (and maybe others, too).",

        "text": "Hello! This is my first post on this sub so excuse if it's a little bit messy.\n\nFor a bit of context before this story, I work in a low-level retail job. It's one I'll be leaving soon and I've already put in my two weeks' notice, so I wanted to celebrate with one of my favorite stories. I have multiple managers at this job and almost all of them are lovely people. They genuinely care about me as an employee. All of them, except for one very unpleasant new manager.\n\nThis one manager is pretty notorious for not doing her job. She will show up very late to work (over 3 hours late in some cases), take lunchbreaks that are over an hour long, and disappear during busy days. She's also an asshole to anyone below her, myself included. Ironically, she will become incredibly angry if my lunchbreak runs over the allotted time (15 minutes, since our store is non-union. I could work longer shifts but I'm not working 8+ hours for one extra 15 minute lunchbreak. They are criminally short) and will come up to me and harass me while I'm just trying to get back to work- which is also not company protocol, I'm supposed to be paged if I end up running over my lunchbreak time. She has also gone as far as to lie to the general manager (her manager) about me being rude and saying things like \"Don't talk to me\" to her. I am someone who is capable of being very professional, even to asshole managers. I would never say something like this at work. She will harass me over 5 or 10 minutes while she takes hour-long lunchbreaks where the longest she could get would be maybe 30 minutes. Other managers seem to hate her too, from what I'm aware of.\n\nShe also has a pretty annoying habit of hovering around my register, trying to catch me slipping up or doing something against the rules. She has gotten on me before for such horrible offenses as wearing sweatpants to work (I stand behind a counter all day- nobody can even see my legs), so it feels like half the time she's just making up things to be mad at me about. However, her hovering gave me the perfect opportunity for some petty revenge.\n\nShe came up to my register to bag one day a few weeks ago, and I finished ringing a customer up for their items and helped her bag. I reached for something in the corner of the counter near the bagging area, a store-brand salad and some packaged plastic cutlery, but this manager informed me that that is her lunch. I apologized and avoided the items and finished bagging. This continues for about ten minutes before she disappears without a word. She did, however, leave her lunch in the corner of the bagging area.\n\nI wanted to pack it up and bag it with a customer's order so badly. However, I'm well aware that there are cameras and if I did something like that, she could easily access the footage and get me in massive trouble, since I knew that was her lunch. She directly informed me of that. So instead, I waited and bagged only the items a customer purchased. Some of them asked me about the salad sitting in the corner, and I told them a manager left it there.\n\nEventually, a coworker comes up to bag for me while I'm halfway through an order. There's a bunch of food sitting in the bagging area. I don't mention the manager's lunch. I am very grateful that I choose to wear a mask to work every day, since the grin on my face when I saw the bagger bag up the groceries and my manager's lunch. I waved them off happily as some old, oblivious customer walked away with my manager's lunch in their grocery bags.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, the manager returns, searching for her lunch. She asks me where her food is. I tell her in my best customer service voice that I didn't even realize it was gone, and must have accidentally gotten bagged up with an order. She says nothing to me, turns and storms off.",

He got replaced, the new boss witch hired someone else in a management position over me (let‚Äôs call her witch #2).

To paint a picture the sandbar was a few hundred feet long and maybe 20-30 feet wide at its widest point and at the time (before idiots fucked it up) it connected on to land on one end and abutted a channel on the other. On one side is a shallow swimming area, on the other a deep dredged area where boats pulled up (plus some island based summer homes but all in pretty tight quarters). This was a busy day so there were maybe 50 people on the sandbar.\n\nOn this particular day someone thought it would be a good idea to let their 12 year old take out a jetski by themself, and this 12 year old was being particularly obnoxious. Driving their jetski in tight circles at speed close to shore, Creating heavy wake in the area where everyone had beached their boats generally doing jetski type things that are fine out in open water but are very problematic in areas near other boaters, canoers and kayakers. Honestly pretty standard stuff for dumb kids using their parents' toys. \n\nThen this kid comes up with a new game for himself. He starts getting the jet ski going really fast and running it up onto the beach. Then he would push it back out, rinse and repeat. Most of the folks on the sandbar are watching at this point because now we are firmly into dangerous territory. Finally the kid gets it going so fast that he fully beached it WELL past the edge of the water. So far past the water's edge in fact that he couldn't even move it an inch. \n\nAnd then the most miraculous thing happened. In a community where if you see someone coming in you help pull their boat up onto the beach, if you see someone with engine trouble you give them a tow, if anyone is in any kind of trouble you check to see what you can do. Having been rescued numerous times by kind strangers when I turtled my sailboat I fully expected someone to step up, give him a talking to but ultimately help.\n\nBut no, we all looked at the kid, watched him struggle and collectively decided not to do a single thing to help him. I left about an hour later and he was still trying to push it back into the water. Don't think I saw that particular jetski again that summer. (Although in the years to come that kid and his family would continue to jeopardize each other's lives on that thing... Just in places where no one outside of their family was at risk of imminent death by poorly controlled jetski)",

        "text": "I'll add in paragraph breaks this time, sorry folks I'm doing this on my phone and didn't realize it would be so hard to read. \n\nSo we left off that CEO found a replacement for Katy shortly after Karen (the office manager) started doing Katy's job. \n\nSince I didn't know the replacement from before and was training her (let's call her Susie) they were all of a sudden totally fine with me meeting regularly with Susie to help her curate events as well as provide new product options to her. Unfortunately, CEO used this to prove how awful Katy was, since after several months of Susie taking over there was a nice boost in sales especially for the newer products. \n\nSusie was in her early 40s and truly doing this job for fun. Her husband's salary was enough to cover their bills but all her kids were in school and she wanted to feel productive. She had a lot less to lose than I did or Katy did since she wasn't relying on this income. \n\nVery quickly Susie realized that the office was run like a total shit show with the CEO changing his mind every other day about how to handle tasks. I had another trainee that was helping me onboard products and we were manufacturing new items so quickly that it was nearly impossible to get every new product into an event which is what we were tasked with. \n\nSo Susie and I decided to meet with CEO and Karen to go over realistic expectations and how best to handle our workload. We tried explaining that with the delays at port we couldn't add the new items because anything that was out of stock was pulled from events and that meant a different in stock item wasn't being featured. CEO and Karen make it seem like they get it, but they truly don't. \n\nDuring the time that Susie began working there I had two family emergencies several months apart. \n\nFirst, my 15f  cousin who wasn't from the US had been working at a camp in the US over the summer and was spending her last week before she flew home with her grandparents. Her grandparents lived about two hours away from where I worked in traffic. I get a call from my dad, he's absolutely frantic cousin's grandfather had been rushed to the ER and she is now alone in their house and needs to leave for the airport. She's very distressed and they are nervous about her going to the airport alone. I tell my dad that I don't know if I can, call the rest of our family first and if no one else can do it I'll go get her. About 15 min later my dad calls me back, no one else can get her. It's also important to note that I worked right near the airport she was going to so even though round trip would take me about three hours if I was lucky once I dropped her off I'd be able to come back to work pretty easily. \n\nI tell my boss there's a family emergency, that I'm clocking out and I'll make up my hours in the evening if necessary. \n\nI drive to pick up my cousin who is barely holding it together. I'm trying to calm her down, but she's so worried especially since she knows that she will likely be on the plane when we all find out if her grandfather is ok. With all the craziness of that morning she hasn't eaten so I took her to get some food for lunch and for the airport which added a bit of time to the whole trip. I ended up back in the office about 5 hours later, it was now around 4 in the afternoon, but I was planning on making up that time.\n\nI come back in and Karen is clearly annoyed with me and wants an explanation as to what happened. I was young and naive and thought explaining the situation would get me some sympathy. \n\nSeveral months after that I got a call from my mom late at night. My uncle who has been battling cancer isn't going to make it, he has a DNR but they are keeping him on life support for about 24 hours to give everyone a chance to say goodbye. I was the only person in my immediate family living in the US so it was really important to me that I go see him. I call my work and tell them, my uncle is about to pass away, I'm going to pay my respects I'll be back on Monday (this was a Thursday night). I'll add that I didn't have anything time sensitive due for work and told them to text me if they had any questions on Friday.\n\nMy boyfriend comes with me so I don't have to do this whole trip alone and we drove through the night to get to my uncle who was in a hospital a few states over. I got to spend a little time with him on Friday, and we did a family call with him that seemed to have lifted his spirit, he wasn't fully responsive at this point. \n\nI had a friend who lived between where my uncle was in the hospital and back home so we stayed there Friday night. I wasn't ready to head home just yet and Saturday night he was still breathing even though he was off life support so we ended up driving back to see my uncle. I didn't realize that he was off of life support at this point and my boyfriend and I were in the room when my uncle passed away. Needless to say it was extremely emotional. The service wasn't going to be for another week or two and he was being cremated so we weren't able to stay and wait for that. We ended up on the road around 2/3 am Sunday morning and found a hotel to crash for 6 hours before driving home. \n\nI arrived at work on Monday and was a total wreck, between watching my uncle pass and the lack of sleep I'm barely keeping it together. I must've gone to the bathroom to cry every other hour. \n\nWell the CEO decides Wednesday is the perfect day to meet about my job performance. He has a whole meeting with me that people who make it far in business don't put their family first and he's just about had enough of my family emergencies. I'm completely speechless since I wasn't expecting such a harsh reaction and meekly reply \"ok\". Keep in mind I only missed one day of work. \n\nI regularly stayed late and came in early but after our little chat I was done doing that. I was going to be graduating from college in about two months and had finally had a strong enough resume to look for other work. \n\nAfter graduation I asked CEO for a raise to go from $16.50 to $20 an hour. I knew we would negotiate and meet in the middle but I was appalled when the response was we can do $17. I explained that I now had a degree, had been working there for two years and at minimum $18 was standard for a post grad. They finally agreed to that but I was already salty after the family talk and was looking for jobs elsewhere. \n\nDuring all this time Susie and I are using our Google chat to coordinate things for work and maybe slightly complain about CEO and how he would tell us to do one thing, we'd explain why that wouldn't work, then he'd push us to try it, it would fail, and then he'd be annoyed that we didn't pushback at his suggestions if we knew it wouldn't work. Again, I was young and stupid and it didn't really occur to me that my work would be able to read those chats. We never straight out called him an idiot but we definitely complained a lot. \n\nThe company is having a hard time functioning since I'm not putting in over time anymore. This meant that everyone I delegated tasks to often spent time doing nothing during the day while I prepped the work they needed to do. I used to come in an hour or two early and stay a few hours late so that come 9 am I could meet with everyone on my team to delegate tasks and do any trainings for the new backends we would be using. \n\nI was missing work randomly at this point for job interviews and between my departments productivity declining and missing days I was put on probation yet again. At no point during this time did Karen or CEO have the sense to get my passwords, daily task, ask where I kept the trainings on my computer, etc. \n\nI have an interview for a great job (that turned out to be a shit show much later on I need to wait to post about it though since I'm still working there) and knew that if I missed another day at work I may lose my job. I was penny pinching at this point, plus the new job wanted someone ASAP so I figured I'd be ok financially if they did fire me. \n\nTwo days after the job interview that I missed work for I get a call at like 9:30 at night from a number I don't recognize while I'm at the gym. I had been applying for lots of jobs and didn't want to miss a call so I answered. \n\nIt was CEO telling me that he no longer felt I was a good fit for the company and they were letting me go. I knew I'd get unemployment and it wasn't like I could argue so I said thank you for the opportunity and we ended the call. I then call Susie immediately to tell her what just happened. As I'm in the middle of speaking she says \"hold on I'm getting a call from another number\". You guessed it, it was CEO firing her too. \n\nI was getting unemployment for about 2 weeks before I started at my new job which was actually a nice break for me since I hadn't really had time off in several years. \n\nI'm at my new job and I start getting emails from my Karen. They want passwords, documents, etc. \nI tell them that everything was saved in my Google drive and anything that isn't there I don't remember. \n\nKaren then calls me to get me to verbally confirm that nothing was saved on my computer and it was all in Google drive. So I said \"yeah.... That's how you asked these files to be saved so that everyone had access.\" I knew how stupid this was on their part because you always want documents like this always saved to your computer so you have the original and sometimes Google drive malfunctions. But I maliciously complied when they told me Google drive was enough. \n\nWell they didn't realize that when they deactivated my email all the files that I was the owner of would disappear. They didn't have a clear list of my tasks and had an impossible time resetting any passwords since per their request all of the logins used my email address, how do you reset a password when the email used for log in is deactivated? \n\nAnyways I laughed myself to sleep that night.\n\nTldr: work doesn't give me a deserved raise, puts me on probation for attending to genuine family emergencies and then fires me because I missed too many days (going on interviews). When they deactivated my email they lost all my work and because I MC and didn't save any documents to my computer two years worth of trainings and documents were lost.",

        "text": "For context:  I am the youngest of 8.  I slept in a room with my 3 teenaged sisters so I learned way too much about life early.  However, I was still a child when his happened and not aware of all the nuances of life.  My nearest brother was 4 years older than me and in and out of trouble.  When I was 7, he used to have me go with him to a nearby convenience store to shop.oft because he felt I could carry a purse but he couldn‚Äôt.  I did this with him a couple of times.  I knew it was wrong to steal but ignored that.  Anyway, I got annoyed because I wasn‚Äôt getting anything out of it and he said he would ‚Äúget me a Barbie‚Äù which he did.  Well, on the way home, he gave my Barbie to some girl he thought was cute.  I was furious. So, a couple weeks later we were at a nearby grocery store when who should come around the corned but my dad and another brother.  My dad asked us what we were doing there.  I smiled Angelo ally at my dad and said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre shoplifting daddy.  Mike said he is going to get me some candy.‚Äù  Then I added ‚Äúit‚Äôs fun‚Äù. My dad, who was one of those types who get quieter when they are angry, just told him in this calm voice that my brother better go wait in the car.  I did feel bad because my dad beat his ass and he was grounded forever. \n\nClarifying things before the questions:  I was a latch key kid.  My parents worked shift work in a factory and had to work different shifts because my siblings kept throwing parties.  Theoretically, an adult was always home but they might be sleeping.  My siblings were in and out and kept very, very loose track of me.",

        "text": "Context: I worked for a manufacturing facility an hour away from a major city in NY state. \n\nParticipants: myself (fresh out of college, foreigner on a work visa), my colleague who was also my lead (let‚Äôs call him Mike) and my boss Jared who was a total loser and a horrible boss. \n\nStory time:\n\nAs I joined the department I came to realize that Mike was a bit odd. I heard him publicly belittle Mexican people and say how they are ‚Äústealing our jobs‚Äù blaaah blah nonsense. I am not Mexican but I knew 100% that he was coming after me very shortly.\n\nHe soon started ‚Äújoking‚Äù with me telling me that he feels I would really like Jeff Dunham because I would ‚Äúassociate with Akhmet the terrorist‚Äù and some other really odd and insulting things about my culture. Keep in mind when I joined the department he was terrified because my skills were a lot better than his, something that was pointed out by executive management.\n\nI remained respectful and looked at him as a mentor. I avoided going to HR because I was on a work visa and was terrified of losing my status. I had no other options. Transferring jobs was a messy situation. I would have to find an employer who was willing to sponsor me after investing in me and I really wanted to stay in the country so I decided I was going to deal with it. All that meant was I was going home being angry in front of my significant other, something I truly regret.\n\nThen there was this one day‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ Mike refused to join a meeting because we were working on a project that I was assigned as the lead. He was integral to the project and when he did not show up at the meeting I respectfully went to his cubical and asked him if he can please join us. His response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to. Get the f* out of my face‚Äù. I asked again respectfully, to which he responded ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you go back to your f* country‚Äù. I said ‚Äúuhhh what did you just say?‚Äù to which he DOUBLED DOWN by saying ‚ÄúI said, why don‚Äôt you go back to your f* country‚Äù. \n\nNeedless to say I was right away in front of the VP of HR who tried to calm me down by saying ‚ÄúMike used to be much worse. He‚Äôs made so much progress. Please don‚Äôt let it get to you‚Äù.  Of course me being the smarties I am (sorry dad) I said ‚Äúokay so you have a daughter right? So if I was a rapist and used to rape her once a week but now I rape her once a month are you going to say I was much worse and now I‚Äôm better so I deserve compassion?‚Äù. You should have seen her face‚Ä¶. She was reeling. Of course the point I was trying to make was that some things are really black or white without any grey areas. \n\nGuess what happened next? They called a therapist to have us both work in front of him so he can see if our interactions ‚Äútrigger each other‚Äôs emotions‚Äù. Unbelievable.\n\nA few weeks in that Mike was his old self and made another xenophobic remark at me which I won‚Äôt even mention so I went to my boss who by that time he said ‚ÄúI was overreacting‚Äù and wanted nothing to to with this. I told him ‚Äúokay so today is Tuesday, if by Thursday morning you don‚Äôt fire him I‚Äôm quitting but on my way out I‚Äôll be walking into the CEO‚Äôs office and let him know what is going on so pick carefully. If I quit you are going to lose your job too‚Äù. He told me I was being an asshole because ‚ÄúMike has severe arthritis and I can‚Äôt just fire him‚Äù.\n\n I took the day off without letting him know and by Thursday morning they walked Mike out but I took the extra effort and let the CEO know and the VP of HR along with my boss were also fired shortly after. \n\nI can‚Äôt tell you how much I was shaking at the CEO‚Äôs office‚Ä¶ oooooof",

        "text": "Longtime lurker, first time poster.\n\nSo I‚Äôm pretty much your average college student trying to make way through too much classwork, clubs, and (god forbid) organic chemistry. Due to my garbage schedule, homework, and my sister visiting for the weekend, I haven‚Äôt had the time to do laundry for over a week.\n\nMy normal clothes and two uniform sets coupled with my sister‚Äôs used sheets and towels meant I had approximately three full loads of laundry to do. In other words, I accepted my fate that I‚Äôd be doing laundry for a few hours. My dorm has 2 washers and 2 dryers, but one of the dryers is currently broken, so I did the smart thing: I only put a load in one washer and replaced it when I moved the load to the dryer, effectively and implicitly claiming the entire room. This worked perfectly for the first two loads.\n\nThe dry cycle took about 5 minutes longer to finish, so I waited an extra 4.5 minutes in my room before going to move the each load into the dryer. But, when I went down to move the the last load, I saw *her*. \n\nStanding in front of the washer, her curly black hair was tied up loosely with a scrunchie. She wore a pair of cute pajamas and some pink slides while‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶taking my laundry out of the washer.\n\nYes, she was taking my clothes out of the washer when there was AN EMPTY WASHER right next to it. So, needless to say, I was pissed off. Like, girlypop, bestie, homegirl, I have *never* met you in my life. Did the thought of using the other washer (like a considerate person) potentially cross your mind?! Also, you didn't even bother waiting FIVE MINUTES?\n\nI went in and picked up my dry clothes and, with smoldering resentment, dragged my dry load to my room. When I came back with my silly little laundry bag to move the soggy load into the other washer, another guy was already there piling his stuff in.\n\nAs any slightly shy, non-confrontational college student would, I decided to react in the most mature way possible: complain about this to my friends in all caps.\n\nIn that conversation, I offhandedly said the following:  \n\nme: \"yknow what would be incredibly petty?\"  \nme: \"if i wait for her laundry to finish and immediately take it out and replace it\"   \nme: \"i will probably not do that but that would be a good story\" \n\nAnd then, one of my friends, the mad genius he is, responded with:  \n\nR: \"do it\"   \nR: \"or or or\"   \nR: \"wait 6 minutes so you can say you took the high ground and waited longer\"\n\nI'm not a monster.\n\nI waited 7 minutes.",

I went to the other end of the store to try to escape her voice but I could still hear every damn word. \n\nEventually, she got off the phone.

A guy in the nearby aisle smiled and nodded at me. I think everyone in the store disliked her as much as I did. Even the employees could barely tolerate her. It was beautiful. \n\nI always wonder about people like this: Do they not know how much people hate them or do they just not care?

        "text": "This happened last week and i only now have time to type it out. One of my friend, \"Lia\" celebrated her 30th birthday. Due to personal reason, she went all out for it. Venue was amazing, food was great, decor was tasteful, good music and guest were asked to wear something fancy. \n\nThe day of, everything was going well until.... someone dropped to one knee. You already know where this is going. Someone actually proposed! At someone else's birthday! I was giving the couple the side eye but i thought maybe this was planned. Maybe Lia knows because who would be bold enough to do this without the host's permission. \n\nSo i went to find Lia. She was sitting at a table surrounded by a few friends looking a mixture of angry and sad. I asked if she knew this was going to happen? She gave a small head shake and said \"well, there's nothing for me to do now right\". I decided then, she doesn't have to do anything. I'll do it for her.\n\nI walked up to the happy couple, who at this point was surrounded by a few people who was congratulating them (the audacity!). To give credit to some people, a lot of the guests was looking awkward, bewildered &amp; had a face of not interested to be involve in the drama. So not everyone lost their common sense it seems. Back to the story, i walked up to her, asked to see the ring. She was all smiley holding out her hand and i made a show of looking at it closely then loudly said \"Well, at least the ring is decent\".\n\nImmediately, smile gone. She looked shock and asked what's that  supposed to mean. Again, loudly i told her \"Girl, you got proposed at someone's celebration which he didn't plan or pay for. You're not even worth that much. I'm just glad he didn't cheapen out on the ring\". Then i turned around, walked to a nearby friend and still in a voice that i want everyone to hear said how tacky and embarassing they are. \n\nLike a switch, everyone then started whispering at them. Some that i heard includes, \"who does that at someone's birthday?\", \"man can't even plan an event and had to mooch of someone else\", \"if i was her, i wouldn't have said yes\".They left quiet fast after that and while the party did end kind of awkward, Lia did looked better at the end so i don't feel guilty. \n\nAs i'm not familiar with the couple i only heard second and third hand story about was has been happening so not sure about the validity. Apparently she has been complaining how her proposal's ruin and she can't even have a second one because she's traumatized by the first one. Thankfully no one is giving her time, instead she's getting even more ridiculed. The next rumour i heard, they (the couple) have been fighting. The proposal was supposedly her idea and he just went along with it. Now, he's getting called pathetic and cheap. I have no sympathy for someone that stupid. \n\nSo moral here people, have some class and learn better manners.",
