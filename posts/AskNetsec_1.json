As I’ve gotten a degree and a few years of industry experience under my belt, I’m learning more about what actually interests me (I’m a little more into malware and threat intel now). I’ve also been able to find out more about what actually working in a certain job like pentesting or red teaming entails, and how they differ. While I like the idea of getting paid to hack into companies, the reality seems more different, especially for pentesting. It strikes me as a lot of meetings to negotiate scope and documentation. A lot of pentests just seem like cookie cutter, pre canned assessments that serve only to check a compliance box. Whereas red teaming, it seems a little more interesting. You have more freedom and room for creativity and getting to play the adversary. For all the pen testers and red teamers out there, does that seems accurate? I would also imagine most red teamers got their start as pentesters, so as the title says, is that the only way in? Or are there other avenues to get into red teaming if pentesting doesn’t have the appeal I thought it would?",

I get what they are conceptually, but I struggle to understand how an attacker could manage to download malware onto a victim’s system without their knowledge. I assume the malware would still need some form of user interaction to run. It seems like this would be incredibly difficult to defend against. I’ve read that things like keeping the browser up to date and only browsing to reputable websites, but that doesn’t seem like it’d be nearly enough. I would think this would also be a major way to weaponize links during phishing attacks, other than try to get users to enter credentials or download malicious files.",

I'm a European Union citizen, quite new to cybersecurity (and by no means a seasoned expert), but I also have a few years experience in other type of positions in tech companies, so not really a totally inexperienced worker either. \n\nMy main priorities are a good salary and also (even if it's later down the road) the possibility to work mostly remote and with flexible schedules. I have a preference for being based in Europe but I'm flexible with that too. Single with no kids and no kind of debt so no constraints on that side either.\n\nWhat are the salaries and job conditions like where you live and what would you say are the best places to start a career? What could be the potential salaries for someone like me? Info about me:\n\n\\- A BSc in engineering  \n\\- A MSc in cybersecurity  \n\\- A 6 month internship in a mid-size cybersecurity consultancy firm (mostly pentesting)  \n\\- 4 years experience in another tech company (one of the big ones), not related to cybersecurity (most of this time I was managing a tech support team but my job was not really technical)  \n\\- I speak 3 languages, including fluent English and Spanish.  \n\\- Tons of international experience, studied/worked in different countries for long periods of time.\n\nThanks everyone for the help!",

I recently passed the OSCP because I want to get into Pentesting at some point in the future. My employee asked me recently if Im interested in cloud security and since its one of my weak points, I want to dedicate more time this year to learn and understand how AWS/Azure/GCP work. This could benefit me to deploy firewalls for customers, understand networking in cloud infrastructures and also if I do find a job as a penetration tester.\n\n\nIm really a potato when it comes to cloud and apart from setting up a vm I dont really have any knowledge. My guess is that I should focus on one cloudvendor and then Ill be able to at least find my way through the others? If so, which one would you recommend and  why? My plan would then be to first take a beginner course/cert followed up by one which focuses on security. Do you know which courses/certs could help me in achieving? Thank you very much, any advice is appreciated",

Some time later, my boss came to me with a new “alternative” way, instead of me leaving the company to study. He put me at a crossroad and I don’t know what path to take.\n\n\nI’m 20, if that’s relevant and the company I work at (for around 2 years now) is in the refurbished enterprise IT field (Cisco/HPE/IBM/DELL), I test refurbished Cisco equipment where I check if everything still works. \n\nI would like to work in the network security engineer or pentesting field in the future, so that’s why I wanted to study computer engineering. My boss’s alternative way was they will sponsor me certification(s?) for around up to maybe 7000 USD (we haven’t talked exact figure yet though). I was thinking about taking CCNP ENCOR + CCNP Security, as I already have CCNA training.\n\n\nTo be more specific, I have CCNA knowledge that I got from following the course on INE.com. I have some C and Python programming knowledge and going through the “Hennessy and Patterson” book (computer architecture book).\n\nIf I pick the certs path, then I can always go back and take a CE undergrad in 2 years time maybe.\n\n\n\nWhat would be the best choice to make and what certifications would be the best to get sponsored?",

Mulvad VPN set up with lockdown mode + kill switch. Then I use virtual machines from within this and regularly delete/create to cut down on just using one.

I'm trying to set up Teams notifications whenever I assign an incident to a group (distribution group in Azure AD I think). \n\nI know that I can set up an automation rule to run a playbook with notification on incident change trigger (owner change). However I didn't find out how to trigger the notifications ONLY when the owner is that particular group. If I set it up like I described, every single owner change would produce a message in the Teams since you cannot filter on particular owners in the automation rule. Am I missing something? The playbook works fine, I just have to figure out how to trigger it only and only with owner being that particular group.\n\nI'd be happy with any ideas you might have. Thank you!",
