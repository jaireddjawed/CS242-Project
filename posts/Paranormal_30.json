I then explained to my father they're just escorting the dead to the afterlife rather matter-of-fact like. To which point I wake up questioning if I dreamt of the wild hunt from folklore or was it something else from North American belief. Any thoughts on this?",

In the morning I was awakened by a commotion in front of the door and I saw a shadow under the door, like someone's legs. I thought he was my brother, so I tried to tell him not to make fun of me and to leave. The shadow slowly retreated. After that I searched the whole house, it was empty, locked and the key was in the lock. Parents were at work. When the key is in the lock from the inside, no one can enter the house even if they have the key. So question is, who locked me in my house and who was in front of my door and how they left? \n\n￼",

I turn around to see my older brother already looking at me and he asks if I've just heard that too snd I reply I did. The laugh sounded like santa on helium or some shit, it was high pitched, disoriented and just messed up. I still don't know what it is and I'm scared i'll hear it again, has anyone ever heard this before or know what it might be? (And no it wasn't my parents, they were in their room sleeping and  i could hear my dad still snoring)",

        "text": "hi there. joined literally ten seconds ago just to post this.\n\nF(19) and have always been into creepy stuff like unsolved mysteries, investigations, true crime and even the paranormal. whilst I am a believer, I have never really experienced paranormal stuff, except for the few times where my bedroom door closed by itself, I've seen apparitions in a house from my hometown that was said to be haunted... but then again, the windows were open in my bedroom when the door closed by itself, and at the time I explored said haunted house, I was nine or ten and influenced by my evil siblings. \n\nlike I said, I do believe, but... some stories are simply too far-stretched for me to TRULY believe that stuff like that happens in real life. full-body apparitions, Ouija boards, ghost radios... yeah. \n\nyesterday I was watching moistcritikal on my laptop, and when I sit down to watch this guy I basically barricade myself in my room, door closed, window closed, water and snacks and I can sit for hours. yesterday was one of those marathons. I had been sitting down in front of my laptop for at least an hour watching this guy react to a cop chase. nothing creepy.\n\nnow, the setting of my bedroom is the following: my desk is against a wall on the opposite side of the window, so, naturally, as I'm sitting down, my back is facing said window. on the windowsill I have one of those aromatherapy oil thingies, my crystals, a himalayan salt candle holder and two Jeff Buckley vinyl. the vinyl are settled securely against the wall. I have a cat but she was in my grandmother's room at the time. windows were closed because the weather is icy here, door closed as well.\n\nall of a sudden, the vinyl, two essential oil bottles, my candle and a few crystals fall off the windowsill. I jump from my seat, nearly choke to death and piss my pants. \n\nlike I said, nothing could have possibly provoked these items to fall off the windowsill, so what in the name of jesus happened? I also have to mention that there is a radiator directly under the windowsill but it wasn't turned on at the time, or at least not enough to generate the heatwaves it usually does (which, even it was on, most it could have done was move the blinds)\n\nI don't think my house is haunted, but I do live in Transylvania so it could have easily been Dracula. opinions? \n\nmarked this as a question because I really want people to try and explain this for me as I am pretty freaked out thinking about it.",

I want to know what else there is.\n\nI did a little more digging and I found that in my religion, there is a book called, the Kaballah. Apparantly some book on Jewish Mysticism, where they claim, the mystical hebrew chants you make, actually possess real energy that makes changes to our world... Occult type shit...\n\nNow im looking for a good couple books that can teach me the Kaballah and all the spoken-word spells you can make...\n\nSome bok called, The Book of the Responding Entity and also the Sefer Raziel...\n\nThere are spells that can make people fall in love with you, spells against your enemies, spells to find a treasure...\n\nNot saying I would use the magic for any of this...\n\nIn all honesty, I'm searching for the powers of telekinesis/levitation. I know it's sorta possible with what ive seen on Reddit, but only in very very very minimal amounts to where its hardly ever useful....\n\nIf we're talking about energy work, if ppl like Jesus Christ can heal the blind and walk on water, with energy alone... Magic surely exists, we just need to rediscover the spells...\n\nThe skies the limit...\n\nThe limit to our magic potential, is likely the limits to our reality...\n\nBeen looking for those 2 books as well as a complete and good translation of the Kaballah...",

In fact, I was known among my friends to be a foodie as I ate a lot of different types of food. Mysteriously, all of my health problems started after I moved to a new apartment. I am from Asia. I know a very well-known master who claims to descend from the sky. He can communicate with Gods and see devils and ghosts, and read previous lives. He has helped many people including government officials and billionaires. I would not reveal their names but one of those billionaires is recognized by Forbes... Anyway, since I became suspicious of the house, I reached out to him to ask what was going on. He said that my illness was actually triggered by the three evil spirits in my house and the bacteria was just a vessel for them. When I asked him why my husband is fine, he explained that I was targeted by them as I am from the sky myself, and that I have the \"energy\" that these desperate souls need to transcend to the next life so they cling onto me.... Do you think ghosts can make you sick?",

        "text": "I believe I met my boyfriends double a few years ago. When I was 19 I still lived with my parents. My best friend and my boyfriend lived in the same town an hour away but in different areas. My best friend invited me over to spend the night so I did. I always slept on the couch in the living room in her little apartment. \n\nMy best friend always made sure to lock the doors and windows because her neighborhood wasn’t the most safe. I would usually double check too because I slept by the front door. Around two in the morning I woke up to use the bathroom. I got up, went about my business and when I came out my boyfriend was standing in the living room. He was working night shift at the time and would usually take his break at 2am, but I was shocked at how he even got into the apartment because I knew the door was locked. He brought me a vape because I asked him to earlier that day. We talked for a bit and he seemed a bit off. It was like he was looking through me. I ended up laying back down because he said he had to go back to work. He leaned down and kissed me, but right before leaving he turned to me and said “tell (sisters name) to get some more locks. It was way too easy to break into here.”. Then he left. \n\nI woke up in the morning and told my friend what had happened. And yes, the door was unlocked because I forgot to lock it again. Later that day when my boyfriend woke up he came over. I thanked him for bringing me the vape again and he looked so confused. He told me he never left work that night and still to this day, three years later denies that he ever left work and I believe him. So my friend went and bought a new lock for the door. Turns out, about two weeks after this all happened some of the apartments were robbed. But hers wasn’t. Maybe it’s because the double warned her to get another lock? \n\nThis still creeps me out so badly to this day. How did the double know to bring me a vape? Did it know that the apartments would get robbed and was it trying to warn my friend? I thought doubles were supposed to be evil? Why was this one good?",

When I was young I use to go to my grandma's house for the summer, it's a two story house. This happened a few times, Me and my grandma were in the same room,  my grandma would be asleep and late at night I would be up watching TV when I would hear something that sounded like a heavy ball almost like a bowling ball falling on to the floor upstairs bouncing a few times and then rolling, mind you it was just me and my grandma at the house. Now thinking back at it we do have golf balls in a glass cabinet upstairs however this doesn't fit the sounds that I heard because of the following reasons: 1. Everytime it happened I would go upstairs and nothing was out of place, the balls where all in the glass cabinet. 2. The sound is coming directly in the room above me, the golf balls where in another room right of the room above me 3. The ball sounded way heavier like I said like a heavy bowling ball. I have no idea what this was or how to explain it, I would like to hear your opinion whether it is trying to debunk it or not, cause honestly I think critically, and if there is an explanation to debunk it I would be glad to hear it. And if you guys had similar experiences or you know what it is I would be glad to hear it as well.",

An old friend hit me up, I started reminiscing, and remembered this... \n\nI believe I've encountered the Black Eyed Children.\n\n≈2011 in rural, Appalachian, WV,  USA. I can find approximate coordinates if anyone is interested. This has always low-key disturbed me. Keeping in touch to this day we've never brought it up again. \n\nWe were at a local/state park sort of place at between 9pm-1am. I remember we were parked alongside the woods and some picnic tables. It was pretty desolate-  we were technically trespassing (17F &amp; 17M at the time) and what we were doing there you can leave to your imagination. \n\nAs our curfews were approaching and we were finishing up our time together we experienced a very ominous feeling. He was in the driver's seat preparing to start the car and pull off. The car doesn't start (we also have a history of experiencing electrical disturbances when together) we sort of laughed it off as it wasn't the first time and talked.\n\nSuddenly to the right (passenger side where I was sitting) we see faint lights coming out of the woods. There was a very ominous feeling. Emerging from the woods there are 4-5 children. Younger than us- like appearing to be 7 —11 years old. \n\nI'm not going to claim they had black eyes- it was dark, and I don't remember as I was pretty shook. I didn't read about the Black Eyed Children lore/phenomenon until years later which described everything else that we experienced. \n\nAll I can say is they were not normal. They didn't belong. The cabins at the park were not occupied- they weren't even getting rented out as it was autumn/winter. We we miles from the park's hotel. There were no adults. They were absolutely out of place.\n\nWhat were the lights? I don't know, but the closest thing I can compare them to are glow sticks— as if they had opened a package of those novelty glow stick packages that include bracelets, necklaces, or wands. But it wasn't like they were having fun or goofing off.\n\nThey just stopped, stood there, and stared at us. He tried asking what they were doing here, if they were lost, where are their parents? No response. The oldest looking M child (a bit heavy set with a grey hoodie on) approached the vehicle just in the front where the passenger headlight/corner would be.\n\nMy friend started really freaking out at this moment. He locked the doors and was like \"Hell no! We gotta go!\" eventually the starts. The children don't move and the kid stays put in front of the car. My friend eventually yells to the kid \"I'm going run you over!\" The boy slowly backs away, raises his arm, and points at us as we were leaving. I didn't look back. \n\n*I am absolutely not making this up!*",

        "text": "Alright y'all, this is gonna be a long one. English is not my first language so there could be some grammar mistakes.\n\nSo just to clarify my parents are completely normal in every sense of the way, they don't believe in God or in anything paranormal*, but they do believe in ghosts. They both went to universities and they are really smart, which makes the fact that they believe in ghost even more strange. But here comes the story, which still haunts me from time to time, because I see no reason why my parents would lie about this.\n\nSo when I was around 8 years old, my grandmother passed away and we visited her in some kind of room before her funeral. When we were about to leave, my mom told me she wanted some time alone. My dad explained a few weeks later that she did that because she can make contact with death people. I have no idea how it all works, but I think she can sense them in a way. A recent example was with my uncle who saddly passed away, she did the same thing but told us that he was \"not here anymore, he is already gone\".\n\nMy father also told me that, when they where in a relationship together (they have now been divorced for 16 years, since I was 3, but they still get along), one of their friends passed away. They were sitting in the dining room and my dad acted kind of weird in a way and my mom asked \"do you feel that he is here?\"  And my dad said yeah and he told her that he could feel him touch his hands and wouldn't let go.. This feeling stayed for a few days before they went to some kind of special doctor that told him to put his hands next to the grave of their friend so his soul could release from my dads body and find it's way. So he did what the person told him and it worked.\n\nI heard this story multiple times, even recently and I'm about to turn 19. When they tell this story they are really serious, while most of the time my dad likes to be not so serious. There's no reason why they would lie to me, so does anybody know what it couldve been that my dad felt?\n\nPS. I used to be scared asf for mirrors because of this (thanks to the bloody mary hype)",

We would call her friend “mrs. Jenny” and she was often throwing parties that my mom would attend. Now with the background I can tell you why I’m writing. One night around 3 am, when I was about 14 (I’m now 26), I got a phone call from an unknown number. It woke me from my sleep and startled me but for some reason I answered it. When I put the phone to my ear it was my mothers voice.. she was sobbing uncontrollably and it was hard to hear her. In between sobs I heard her say “Annsley it’s your mom. Don’t tell your dad I’m calling you but I’m hiding in the closet to tell you that I was r*aped at Mrs. Jenny’s party on new years.” I freaked out and started crying with her. I ran into my parents room and they were both sound asleep… I woke my dad up crying uncontrollably and freaking out. He demanding I hand him the phone, he said he heard nothing on the other line. He then handed me back the phone and I heard again in my mothers voice “shhh” and she hung up.. to this day I don’t know how to explain this experience and my mother swears nothing like that happened and if it did she would have said something to someone. Does anyone feel like they know what could have happened this day? I still think about it and never answer unknown calls to this day. I’ve talked to my close friends, daughters of “mrs. Jenny” and they teared up in fright and had no idea. They said the whole story gave them goose bumps.. another aspect to add is both of our dads were stationed in Germany at the time, her in spangdahlem and me in rahmstien. Our lives were totally separate and our social lives didn’t inter tangle in other than our moms. I just know to this day that was my mothers voice…",

It’s the only medication so far that has worked for me and I’ve never had issues with it before. However, yesterday I also went to the dentist and had to get cavity filling for the first time in my life. \n\nThe numbing went away by evening and I took my Allegra and amitriptyline around 11pm as usual. Usually the amitriptyline makes me feel a bit sleepy after an hour, but last night a strong wave of tiredness hit me instead. I was already laying in bed in the dark at the time, but tried to keep my eyes open and stay awake for another 10min because I was talking to someone job the phone. I started seeing a weird darker mass a few feet in front of me. It seemed to be constantly rippling but kept a human shape. I tried blinking and looking around my room to make sure I wasn’t imagining things, but I kept seeing it in the same spot. \n\nI texted my sister that I think I’m hallucinating and she opened my door to check on me, she suggested the dental numbing mixed with my medication caused it. Our cat also walked in before she closed the door and left. The cat is black so I didn’t notice until I felt something hit the side of my bed. I turned my phone light on and saw her, but instead of immediately jumping on my bed to sleep with me as she normally would do, she kept sitting on the floor and staring at me. I got up and let her out of my room again and decided to just close my eyes right away and sleep it all off. \n\nI looked more into side effects of amitriptyline but found that people who hallucinate from it see spiders, feel like they are in a dream or have vivid dreams, and (more commonly) have auditory hallucinations.\n\nCould seeing that shadowy human mass be a spirit or am I just hallucinating from my medication?",

        "text": "When I was a kid my family was doing renovation on our house so we rented a house down the road. My dad peaced out and my mother used to work a 7;7 rotation with 12 hour shifts from like 6pm to 6am, meanwhile it was a brick house and a lot of weird stuff would happen there:\n\n• Door handles would shake or the door would burst open by itself \n\n• The sliding closet doors would open and close by themselves. Even my mother admitted to laying in her room and hearing it happen a few times, yet decided to accuse me of doing it despite there being no way I could sneak into her room, quickly open and close the door, then quickly run out without her seeing me.\n\n• Even with the lights off in my room the light would leak in from under the door, (the kitchen light was often left on) and I could see these shadowy things crawling in the dark. The worst one was the time I woke up because I could feel air slightly flicking in my face to see a large shadowy hand wriggling in my face, once it realised I was awake it tried to touch my face before I jumped out of bed.\n\n• My cousin slept over in the room with me once and I woke up with her in my bed and the lights on, because she said something was trying to grab her in her sleep.\n\n• We both saw a gremlin thing crotching by the closet door one night so we started sleeping in the living room, while sleeping in the living room the door to my room would shake and the door would burst open, one night we told it to go f#ck itself so it was like someone was punching the door from the inside.\n\n• Sometimes stuff would happen like I would be watching TV then go to the toilet, walk out and find the TV off and the radio on.\n\nThere were many other incidents that occurred but it was like whatever it was constantly wanted to remind me it was there. I had childhood friends that said they saw something poking it's face out from behind the end room door, otherwise one was poked hard or their hair was pulled during hide and seek. I told my mother about these things and she told me I was just imaging it.\n\nWhen we were moving back to the old house, I started carrying a box or two to the house after school. It was like 5pm and I was walking when it felt like something was trying to follow me. I kept looking back and nothing was there. I went into the house and put the box into the living room. It felt like someone was in there with me, when this random burnt CD (my sister used to make CD playlists in the early 2000s lol) rolled out from under a table. I decided to roll it back. The CD rolled out again but this time I felt the urge to run, it was like having the energy of someone standing there angrily screaming at you and threatening to hit you yet you couldn't see or hear the person. It felt like I was about to be attacked. I ran back to the other house.\n\nYears later my mother admitted to seeing something grey thing lurking around my bedroom door when she came home one morning, like it was peaking at me through a gap in the door then quickly disappeared. Because it scared her she pretended not to see it and didn't tell me. She would also try blame me for the closet door thing so she could rationalise it and not feel scared.\n\nWhen we moved back to our house, I used to sleep with the door open. Then out of like nowhere the door would start swinging. Once I heard a thump and found a random hunk of wood had been thrown at the door. I also had a bunk bed and I would sometimes see something climb up the ladder then the bed would shake, as if someone above was having a seizure. There were times in the night I was too scared to open my eyes because it felt like something scary was going to be staring at me if I looked.\n\nThen suddenly it stopped.\n\nYears later I decided to do some detective work and ask the owners if someone once died in that house, they said no. I also talked to the owner's son (he's a little bit younger than me and we went to school together). I remember him telling me he felt like he got shoved one day in the house and back when we had those big box TVs with the glass screens he could see the reflection of this angry man in a green shirt despite no one else being in the living room with him.\n\nIt also wasn't the first time I heard of the green shirt man turning up in one of the houses they owned, two incidents of two separate people seeing something like this angry man in a green shirt just in the house somewhere. Which over time I do wonder if it's something the father/owner did and its like a curse or something they messed with. Back in the day the father and his brother used to do some vile and gangster wannabe stuff back in the 80s and 90s later they bought up properties, ran local businesses, had families, and pretended nothing happened.",

        "text": "A story from my Aunt, one she never forgot and is still intrigued by.\n\nBack in 1994 ,my Aunt was a young vibrant woman who was on a European vacation with a few friends, enjoying a much deserved respite from college.\n\nThey did the typical tourists jaunts , visiting old castles,  shopping, and partying . One evening around mid December, they all 3 found this old charming pub located in Cornwall.\n\nAround 10 at night they came in taken aback at this old style  pub, even the place had old fashion oil lamps lighting the place instead of electricity.\n\n\nThe place seemed so out of sorts for the modern world. But my Aunt and her girlfriends were so excited to find such a likely historical place , the weird vibe it gave off just made it so intriguing.\n\nAs they sat down at a nearby table , a tall pale skin bartender bowed towards them, he was a really handsome and well dressed individual, though his outfit was very well styled it seemed so out of date. Surprisingly he sat 3 well made drinks before then.\n\nOne of my Aunt's friends asked how much she owed him, the handsome gentleman just smiled and replied\n\n\" We would never dream of charging such beautiful ladies  for refreshments, besides the gentlemen at the table over there have covered any charges, enjoy\"\n\nLooking over , three gentlemen all raised their wine glasses in regards to us, and like the bartender was just as handsome\"\n\nBeing the young women they were all blushed and joked they must've found GQ models on vacation  As her friends chuckled, my Aunt could feel something was totally off about this place, the bartender and the other men were the only people besides themselves, and all these men were well dressed but definitely out dated outfits.\n\n\nThough something about the place nagged her she brushed it off , sipping with her friends on  these amazingly tasty drinks.\n\nAfter about an hour chatting amongst themselves, these gentlemen who had bought their  drinks all came over and introduced themselves . At this point my Aunt was kinda tipsy and didn't catch the other gentlemen's names , but the one who seemed to take an interest her name was Cyan. Up close he seemed to radiate an unnatural glow and was simply the most handsome man shed ever met. He was tall, long dark hair, and blue eyes that were bright and definitely filled with interest. \n\nThey all asked if they could sit and chat with them a bit, my Aunt and her friends thought a friendly chat couldn't hurt, moved their chairs over to make room and Cyan and his friends gathered their chairs from the other table  and joined them.\n\nCyan and his friends had these unusual accent , they weren't English natives, but seemed more Russian or Hungarian. It certainly wasn't an accent my Aunt was used to \n\nFor a few hours of chatting with them and a few more drinks later, things started to blur, as if the world seemed to tilt , glancing over my Aunt noticed her friends were seemingly dizzy holding their heads , their talking companions now holding their faces buried in their hair  gently speaking to them \n\nCyan was holding my Aunt in the same manner, my Aunt started freaking a little, fearing they were drugged and something horrible was going to happen  Cyan whispered in her ear\n\n\"Calm yourself ingerul meu , no harm shall come to you, you're a fine sweet red wine I wish to drink, I shall never forget you\"\n\nMy Aunt claims she passed out and her and her friends woke up in their beds at the hotel the next morning, all were dumbfounded how they managed to leave the pub, that perhaps their handsome companions helped them home \n\nMy Aunt and her friends were kinda bummed they didn't get more information on the gentlemen, but in the end chalked it up to a fond memory and finished their vacation up and flew home.\n\nBut strangely they all needed to see a doctor a few days after they returned, and all 3 had anemia and needed iron supplements to boost the iron in their blood.\n\nYears later my Aunt is much older now and married to my uncle, both took a vacation to Cornwall, she wanted to show her husband this historical pub she had visited in her youth \n\nBut the place they  arrived at was  a old building of stone , falling apart and nothing like she remembers. Asking a few locals had there been a pub here once, and they told her yes but that was a few hundred years back and wasn't nothing but a husk now \n\nI asked my Aunt how she felt about all these mysteries unanswered and she just smiles and says \n\n\"I don't worry about it , even if it was just some crazy dream we had, Cyan and his friends would always be their friends in her mind  and she hoped her sweet red wine quenched his thirst\"",

He landed on a distant mountain top.\nThis man was tall, as tall as the statue of Jesus in Brazil, maybe larger.\nHe had on a white robe, and white undergarments, showing nothing but his hands and bare feet, his hair was long and white, he also had a white mustache/beard.\n\nWhen he spoke there was a rumble that rumbled through the atmosphere, the air, the earth, it was a deep voice of authority, fatherlike, I felt the bass rumble through my body, it’s bass beating like a drum on my chest.\nThe words I remember him saying were:\n\n“The world has been warned, and no one listened”\nOr something along those lines.\n\nHe then extended his arm and with one snap of his fingers, the wind picked up with a great intensity, the earth began to shake violently.\nI began to witness the beautiful forest around me become destroyed with trees being uprooted from the ground, flying in every single direction, cars and motorcycles flying into the air.\n\nI was scared and suddenly our car flew too, suddenly I flew out of the car and he flew to me, calling my name, a building made of stone with large wooden doors appeared suddenly out of nowhere and the doors opened, he made the wind push me inside, he said “Don’t worry” saying my name afterwards “you’re going to be okay.”\nWhen he spoke to me though the intensity was gone, it was soothing, it calmed me, despite what was going on outside I felt safe.\n\nI saw him fly off and the doors closed, then I woke up.",

        "text": "So, I was wondering when it was appropriate to share this story with the world. Since watching an episode on the TV show \"Haunted\", I think now is the right time. I will be telling this story in multiple parts, but first here is the setting for you.\n\n\tI will be changing the names of the exact locations to prevent folks from attempting to find them (you don't want to go there anyway trust me). I grew up in a very small town in rural Pennsylvania. And as you can imagine there isn't very much to do around the area. This led to me digging into some of the local mysteries, legends, and horror stories. You know what they say, idle hands and minds are the devil's playground. Well, that couldn't be more true in this particular case. This led to the legend of Bearnhyll (pronounced {BARN} - {HILL}) cemetery. As you can imagine many legends might surround a Cemetary but this one is unique. As the legend goes there was a young girl named Ruby who lived in the small village of Bearnhyll with her family. Sadly one-day folks in the village close by suspected her of being a witch and casting curses. At this, they decided to put together a mob in the night, dragged the girl from her home, lead her to a field on the outside of the village, and beheaded her on a stump of a freshly cut down tree. Other tragedies struck the town and the surrounding area soon after this incident. Again as to not give away the location I cannot share any more information on the legend and the area, but I will continue with my experiences there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart 1: The DOG\n\n\tOne night as my Boyscout troop and I were camping in the woods not far from the cemetery we decided it would be a nice and spooky idea to make a 2 am night hike about a half mile from our campsite to Bearnhyll cemetery. Though there were several objections the YAYs overrode the NAYs and so we set out on our journey through the thick dense Appalachian woods at night. Slowly but surely we bushwhacked our way through the thicket and all along the way stories of the cemetery were shared. One story of a young boy that is buried there caught everyone's attention because supposedly the boy drowned in the nearby Piney Run Creek. The young boy had a dog that he was best friends with and when he passed the dog refused to leave his gravesite and starved to death. \n\n\tBarry, another scout in the troop felt that this story was a joke and proceeded to poke fun at the story and tell all of us how dumb we were for believing it. He began to run in between us all poking us and jabbing us to spook us. He then yelled, \"I bet you are all scared for no reason, what a joke\" as he began to sprint ahead of the group just barely in eyesight. We watched as he laughed and his flashlight bounced ahead of us in the underbrush. But all of a sudden it was like we crashed into a wall, heavyness filled the air just as we see Barry freeze and go silent right in front of us. As we catch up to him we realize why he froze. We had broken through the treeline on the outskirts of the cemetery and just a few feet ahead of us started rows and rows of headstones. As we entered the clearing the heaviness sank into us deeper, a dense fog began to flood the cemetery and it no longer felt safe.\n\n\tWe began to spread out across the cemetery looking at headstones in hope that the story of the boy was not true. David asked \"where is the boy\" but without missing a beat we could hear Barry yell out \"here it is\" and we all turned to face him. He began to mock and scoff saying \"silly kid, stupid Dog\" as he picked up a handful of pebbles and started throwing them at the kid's headstone. Suddenly out of nowhere, we hear a low growl from out of the bushes to the right of Barry. Barry began to say \"hey did you guys hea....\". Then WHAM, Barry is knocked off his feet and is being dragged across a small section of the cemetery and out into the woods. He is being dragged faster than we can run to catch up to him. Now I know you're thinking how is this even possible? I should tell you that Barry was a uniquely small and scrawny kid so knocking him off his feet and dragging him quickly isn't exactly a hard task. Eventually, two of the faster and larger boys in our troop caught up with him. They grabbed his arms and started to pull as they looked in the direction of whatever was pulling him. All they could see was Barry's leg suspended in the air. All they could see was his pants torn and his ankle exposed and it was bleeding. A few more of us caught up and wrestled against nothing for Barry. Then the rest of our troop caught up, and that was when whatever it was decided to let go of him. We all fell as the tension broke.\n\n\tQuickly we regained our composure and started to administer first aid to Barry. His ankle was pretty messed up and so wrapped and found some branches to splint his ankle and lower leg. Once we had his ankle immobile we lifted him into a human crutch carry as we decided to leave because we had all had enough. We made our way back to our campsite and made sure he was good for the night and the next morning we were able to hike to a location for cell service and called his parents to pick him up. I don't believe I ever saw him on another random camping trip with our scout troop after that. Unless it was at a more established campground like summer camp.",

My mom isn’t the most superstitious person, but she keeps an open mind to things. She has never reported a paranormal sighting before. \n\nA few weeks ago she was awoken by a cramp in her leg due to dehydration which led her to go to the bathroom for a drink of water. Upon leaving the bathroom, she saw, about five feet in front of her, a translucent cream-coloured mist which was long, unmoving, and suspended in the air at eye level. \nAfter about 3 seconds, it moved away from her and evaporated. She didn’t have a spooky or unnerved feeling like it was a spirit, but she did immediately call me to check if I was okay. Seeing that I was okay, I’m just curious what all of you doubters or believers speculate this could be. \nHave a great day!",

        "text": "EDIT: I tried to post a separate update, but it got deleted.  I guess I unknowingly violated a rule...????\nAnyway, the update is that I heard it again a few days ago; however, this time though, it happened in the middle of the afternoon. And, this time it was so loud and clear that my dog reacted to it. He started urgently barking and checking each door (that leads outside) to see if there was someone there. Interestingly enough, my mother in law was sitting in the living room (the back wall of my closet, where the banging is emanating from, is on the other side of the wall from the living room), so I went out there, as I thought that maybe someone was at the front door, and I said to her, \"Did you hear someone knock\". She replied that she hadn't. WTH??!?? How could she not have heard that?!? Plus, my husband hasn't heard it either... so, literally I'm the only one who can hear it?!? Well, I guess other than my dog...I'm glad he heard it too...\n\n\nThere have been some weird noises and things going on in my house for a few months now, so I thought I would tell y'all what's going on and see what y'all think.\nThis past summer, my husband and I moved in with his mom as she is elderly and has health issues, and my husband felt that it wasn't safe for her to live by herself any longer. \nBefore we moved in we had been living a couple towns over, which was about 25-30 minutes from here. As we lived relatively close, I hadn't spent a significant amount of time here - never overnight, just would come visit for a few hours and then go back home.\nWell within the first couple weeks of living have, I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, something wasn't right with the house. I mentioned it to my husband, and he just kinda shook it off. He said that when his mom had bought the house about 12 years ago, he stayed here (in the same bedroom that we're in now) for about a month, and he hadn't noticed anything then. \nTo give you a frame of reference: it's a single story brick house with 3 bedrooms and about 1800 sf. There is an attic, but there isn't any stairs, it's more like a crawl space; there isn't a basement as we are in East Texas. When his mom bought the house, it had only been built two years prior as it was the model home for the newly constructed subdivision.\nOk so this is what's been happening....\nFor about a week and a half to two weeks after I had mentione feeling the weird vibes, my husband started waking up in the middle of the night, but not understanding why. This would happen 2-3 times a week, and he wouldn't be able to fall back asleep for another hour or two. Well by the second week of this occuring, he would just lay in bed listening and looking out our partially opened bedroom door, which allows you to see part of the living room and partly into the kitchen, watching the shadows in that area. At this point, he'd be awake for 3-4 hours before being able to go back to sleep. He said that sometimes it would look like the shadows would move, but he attributed that to the motion light outside the front door, which partially illuminates the living room as the front door is beveled glass. \nThen things started to get a little weird.\nAfter a week or so, on and off, of watching the shadows, one night when he was awakened, he thought he could hear two people talking outside our bedroom, on the other side of the wall in the side yard. At this point, he woke me up and asked me to listen if I could hear the talking as well. And yep, I sure could. So he got up, grabbed his pistol and went outside; he first walked the perimeter, and then around the back yard and behind the buildings out back, but he couldn't find anyone or anything. \nWe've been here for about six months and every so often, we'll hear talking (usually it occurs some time after midnight to 3 or 4 am) but there's no one outside.\nI have also had my own strange auditory occurances. I've heard it maybe 3-5 times since we've been here, the most recent was last night. \nAll the times that I've heard it, has been around 10-11 pm, while I've been in the walk-in closet in our bedroom. Suddenly I'll hear, BOOM BOOM BOOM, like someone is knocking real loud on a wall or door, but I can't pinpoint where in the house it's coming from. When I heard it last night, I quickly walked out into the living room to see if someone was really knocking on the front door. Well when I went out there, my dog was laying on the floor, in the area between the LR and the kitchen, and he just looked up at me, wondering what the hell I was doing. He has excellent hearing, so if anyone had knocked, he would have been barking. \nI went back into my room, to inside the closet to finish what I was doing. Not even a minute or two later, I hear the knocking again, but this time it's more of an urgent rapid BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM, like someone wants in RIGHT NOW.\nCan anyone make sense of this? Has anyone experienced this themselves? \nThanks for y'alls input!",

Anyways knowing that he was at the end, we wanted to go be with him and say our goodbyes, but he didn’t want us to see him because of what cancer did to him ( he was a well built guy who always went to the gym, and always cared about how he looked, I saw him early on during his fight with cancer and it was crazy how sunken in and thin his face started to look) and we were trying to convince him to let us see him, but before we could he passed away. I was hurt/upset that I couldn’t get to see him and say goodbye in person, but a couple of days later after the funeral I had a dream we were in the gym with him and he had his usual gym attire with the white tank top lol, and he was back to his former self and it was so great seeing him! I remember him telling me in the dream that he was sorry that we didn’t get to see each other one last time, and I woke up with a feeling of closure.",

        "text": "Hi, on a recent post I was asked to elaborate on this story but I didn't get time before the post was deleted. So I thought I'd make my own post. \n\nBackground info: \n\nThe local castle is a well preserved 15th century Tower House with an immaculate bawn wall.  The inside of the castle is no longer accessible but approximately 45 - 50 years ago it was (relevant later). The former owners (English landlords) built an impressive mansion house further up the driveway to the castle in approximately the 18th century and the landlords resided there (now demolished, relevant later).\n\nThe Lord that lived there sometime in the mid to late 19th century was reputed not to have been a nice or fair landlord.\nAfter he died, his apparition was seen riding through the fields at night with a horse and carriage.  This terrified the locals. Every night after his death, the ghostly carriage rode up the driveway at midnight and stopped outside the front door.  His son was terrified that his father was coming for him.\n\nHis son called the local priest, who in turn, called the Bishop and other local parish priests.  The group of priests waited on the front steps of the house at midnight for the carriage to appear. When it did, they tried to banish the spirit. One by one, the priests fainted until only the local parish priest and the Bishop remained.  They forced the ghost down the road into the old tower house castle and banished him to a room there, which was promptly boarded up.\n\nMy grandfather worked in the gardens of the mansion and maintained it was the scariest place he has ever been. He said he would travel any road or stay in any place at night but never ever this castle.  He said that for seemingly no reason every animal would go berserk.  Horses, cattle and dogs would freak out. \n\nMy mother used to go inside the castle went it was open 45 - 50 years ago. She said that the second floor of the castle was entirely bricked up with concrete blocks. She always warned us about going there and said it would probably be OK if we were respectful and never ever say his name. \n\nAfter a local hunt went around the castle grounds nearly 15 years ago. My neighbour had an experience.  She lives close to the castle, you can see it from her backdoor.  A few days after the hunt was around, she heard the sound of a drum.  It started low, then came closer and closer, louder and louder. The family who all had heard it, stood outside facing the castle and this drum sound. Coming closer and louder, then fading away, before coming right back louder and closer. It frightened them, so neighbour went back inside for the Holy water. Once she shook it, the noise ceased. She hasn't heard it since. Her kids, whom I grew up with, were not aloud near the castle, in fact they were told never to speak about it. I knew as a kid that they had been warned about that place as I had been. But i could never get them to acknowledge the place.\n\nThis castle is rural. It is very pretty, but it is nearly always deserted. Recently my sister and I have both taken to walking around the grounds after work to let the dogs stretch their legs. This only happened a few months back as winter was approaching the evening grew darker quicker. We were walking along outside the bawn wall with our two dogs.  My sister remarked how it had gotten dark very fast and it was already dusk. Then for no reason, the dogs stood up and started barking wildly at nothing (there's no close houses, no people, one road in and out. We would've seen them). They just stared into space barking crazy. We looked at each other and literally ran to the car and left. We've been back since but we took the hint and don't stay as late as dusk anymore.\n\nI've been to spooky places before, but this place takes the biscuit. It so quiet and the birds don't sing.  Having said this, if you were to Google this castle and you can, you wouldn't find a scrap written about the encounters had at this place. Its entirely local stories. \n\nI've plenty of local stories, many of which concern fairies (fairies, fairyforts, fairypaths) if anyone is interested, I will share.\n\nThanks.",

Turning around it was a man in a white robe , part of which was slightly thrown over his shoulder , but the shocking part was ,half his face was mutilated,and was reaching out to her stumbling, still speaking in a language she didn't understand.\n\nSo freaked out she stumbled backwards falling. Her brother nearby rushed over to ask what happened.she said help that man he's hurt, her brother gave her a funny look at her asking ,what man? Looking around, the guy in the white robe was gone \n\nLater she checked her phone to see if her video recording earlier caught the Man on camera , but there was nobody in it. \n\nOddly enough, you can pick up a few words in a language that's not recognizable on the sound, least not to her or me. \n\nSince then she's refused to visit Rome again or any ancient sites for that matter .",

There were many places I enjoyed exploring, one was a small cave ,It wasn't anything too grand , just your typical rocks , squirrels prowling around in it, weeds . etc \n\nAbout a week into my stay , I went back to explore the cave some more, and to my surprise, I found this lovely little white flower, it had like teal-like diamond shapes in it with purple tips on the end. It was sitting on the largest rock in the cave.\n\nI picked it up and it had the most wonderful smell, even to this day nothing smelled even remotely as fragrant as this flower.\n\nBut where did it come from? Who left it? My grandparents farm was very remote,and I didn't see any of their friends visiting. \n\nAs I was looking at this flower it simply fell to ash in my hand, Im not even sure you could call it ash it just evaporated in my hand \n\nBeing sad I lost my treasure I stood up looking around hoping I didn't accidentally destroy someone's flower I got up and picked another flower, a morning glory I think and put it in the place.\n\nOver time , I started to receive more of these flowers I originally got, laying on the large rock, the morning glory would be replaced with them but after smelling that wonderful fragrance, they would turn to ash.\n\nSo it went on like this for a month, me and whoever this gifter was exchanging flowers . Sometimes I could feel something watching me and a sense of joy would come over me .\n\nEventually I left to return home, in time my grandparents passed and the farm sold .\n\nBut from time to time I can smell that fragrance of that odd flower. Even as an adult now it still brings me a sense of comfort.\n\nBut who was this flower gifter? A ghost? Was it just my 10 year old imagining the whole thing?\n\nI don't know, but if it was real I hope they enjoyed the morning glories.",

        "text": "So, I have a ritual every solstice.  \n\nI tend a fire from dusk until dawn (or I run out of wood as tonight is looking, whoops?) and I hold my silence.  As a chatterbox with ADHD, this is a very important ritual for me, and one of the only rituals I observed.\n\nToday, I drew a tarot card to start the ritual, a departure from my usual.  I drew the fool.  A card that makes a lot of sense for where I'm at in my life.  New home, new living situation, start of a new solar year, my life has completely changed since the last solstice.  Ended a multi year saga with my ex of separating, and sold the house together this year (somewhat reconciling and letting go along the way!)\n\nAnd then it began as always.  I built the fire just prior to sunset, and waited to start the blaze until the moment of sundown.  I than began my silence.  I usually take this time to be mindful and meditative, but this time I'm feeling very playful about it all.  \n\nI enjoyed tending my fire, riding high in the energy from a friend I haven't seen in a while visiting.  I play some VR games between rounds of checking on the fire, my partner comes home, gives me some affection before heading to bed (I'm still silent so not the usual catching up on our days.). My other roommate has gone to bed at some point.   \n\nAt it's a little after 11:30pm at this time (just a bit ago) and I go out to tend to the fire.  The wood is running low (couple hours at most) and I took my time arranging the cinders as best I can for a slower burn.   The whole time things feel notably darker than prior trips out.  Maybe it's just my imagination, maybe it's the lights from town going off and not reflecting off the clouds anymore, though I did remember a relatively clear sky around 7:30.  Who knows.   Nothing feels bad though, it's really nice honestly :).\n\nThen I come back in and take a photo for my ex.   The one I mentioned above.\n\nHer mom passed on solstice a few years back.   Anyhow, as soon as I took the photo I saw it.\n\nEyes.  Looking right up at me.   Reflecting the fire, dancing flames peering up at me.  They didn't seem unhappy or anything, just... Curious perhaps.  \n\nI could see them for a few seconds in the camera's live preview after the photo was taken. I glanced up to see if I could spot the source, but saw nothing.  Looking back down at the screen it was still there.  And then it seemingly turned and disappeared, stepping backwards, but all that's there are a couple trees and then a fence.  Thing is, I saw some movement in the distance at that moment too when it turned, not just on the camera preview.\n\nIt's hard for me to tell.  It's not a cat, and it looks bigger than a raccoon to me, and it looked much higher up.  At least the height of a child of 6 or 7.  The photo makes it almost look like a bear, but the energy reminds me more of a bird (which my ex and her mom both remind me of). I almost think it might have been a deer, we do get them, but...   I mean.  Look at the photo and judge for yourself.  Am I crazy of is there a figure there.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  I've considered the obvious, that its a lens effect, and it's definitely possible, but then my eyes would have been playing tricks on me on the movement I saw there.\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/YjXvkF2V",

(Usually birds around my area don’t whistle for 4-5 seconds and have a odd pause. )\nWhatever was making the noise sounded like it had lips or was actually whistling. I don’t have tinnitus nor is my house broken in any sort of way to be making these sounds either. I’m not on any medication and I don’t hallucinate or have delusions either so.. I dunno. There really isn’t a clear reason why I heard the whistling.\nI had the feeling to get up from my bed and open the blinds to see what it was, but something in my gut was telling me if I did I would regret it, so I stayed in my bed in silence and tried to go back to sleep. \nNow I’m a skeptic but I do believe in the paranormal and respecting it but this??? I don’t have an explanation for this and it’s freaking me out. Like is there some sort of being that does this kinda stuff and how I can protect myself from it?",

        "text": "A couple of weeks ago I had posted about hearing muffled talking and knocking in my house. Well, I have an update. Thankfully I have not heard the muffled talking since my original post; however, the knocking has continued. \nThe other day I hadn't been feeling well, so I had went to lie down in bed for a little bit. My dog had followed me and was laying down on the floor between the foot of the bed and the closet. I had only been in my bedroom for a few minutes, when all of a sudden I heard the all-too-familiar 'BOOM BOOM BOOM', coming from inside the closet, somewhere within the house. Mind you it was mid afternoon, so it was still daylight. Anyway, the knocking or banging, whatever you want to call it, was so loud and clear, that my dog instantly reacted, and started urgently barking and running out towards the living room. I followed him as I thought maybe there actually was someone at the front door, as it was the afternoon. Nope, no one at the front door. I also checked the back door, as well as the side door, and nope no one there either. Meanwhile, my dog is still urgently barking. At least this time I didn't hear the five pounding knocks like I had before (as detailed in my original post)!\nWell later on that day, I was talking to my mother in law, who used to live here and stays here from time to time,  and she mentioned that she used to wake up in the middle of the night because she thought that she had heard someone knocking on the door. I suddenly remembered that she had mentioned that before, but at the time, I hadn't really thought much of it as I had figured it was probably the ice maker she had heard, as it is kinda loud. Plus she has Parkinson's and most likely early onset dementia, so paranoia is an unfortunate side effect of these conditions; which I had also contributed to for her hearing the knocking (she's always been fearful of someone breaking into the house. We don't live in a bad neighborhood, but she had been living here by herself). \nSo I don't know what's going on, but it's getting to be kinda annoying!",

I think I may have experienced something but i’m not sure. \n\nFor a short explanation, recently i have been having a really hard time with my mental health. I moved in back home, decided to take a leap semester, and brought my belongings with me. I have no friends in this city, broke up with my ex 1.5 months ago, and have (regrettably, hopefully this will change), been doing a lot of drugs under the radar and alone which has destroyed my health and happiness. Lately I have prayed to God a lot, and have felt a peace in return, despite my circumstances. I consider myself Baptist which is why this encounter concerns me. \n\nEarlier I was laying in bed, and sometimes at night to calm my anxiety before bed, I will talk out loud to myself. For example maybe i’ll say, “Okay, tomorrow let’s make it a goal to wake up before 12 and eat 3 meals.” You get the point. As i said, my mental health hasn’t been the best lately and so a lot of my self talk has been negative. \n\nI’ve been sober for the better part of today, and i’m coming down, so i loudly exclaimed, “F*ck, without a girl or drugs, life just can’t be worth it. I can exercise and make money, it still isn’t worth it”.\n\nRIGHT after saying this, I mean immediately after, my strobe light i have pinned to my wall cut on in full power. The room felt so noticeably colder my hands felt like they were in ice water. I was confused, so I jokingly said out loud, “whatever ghost that’s controlling my light can shut it off and leave”. And then the light shut off for a solid 5 seconds, leaving me speechless, before coming back on without the strobe mode - just a solid LED blue color. The room felt instantly warmer as well, but maybe it’s placebo. \n\nNot even sure what to make of this. It’s not the first series of odd events in this house, my parents have had items moved to different areas from original places. Personally i’ve never had anything happen to me, but i do get the vibe i’m being watched and my friends have ALL said the same thing , some going as far to say they feel an evil energy, i don’t believe it .\nThoughts?",

Last week paintings fell of my wall, and this week a water bottle lunged itself across my living room and two of the aforementioned loud bangs on my door happened this week alone. \nPreviously it has been mild, like feeling as if someone was sitting on my bed when I was laying down; but never this bad. I would like to mention that I’ve always been sensitive to this kind of stuff. My last place I woke up two days in a row with 3 scratches in a perfectly straight line on the back of my ankles, and in my childhood home I have a vivid memory of seeing someone standing at our doorway when I was about 4-5. Is there anything I should do to reduce the amount of happenings?",

        "text": "This story is kind of hard to explain if you don’t know the layout of my apartment. I live with my mom, dad and two siblings. It’s not the biggest apartment in the world so my younger siblings share one room, but it’s divided into two halves (basically their own rooms but technically not). Their room is divided by a bunk bed and a bookcase, sealing of their halves from another. I hope this makes sense. \n\nMy younger sisters half of the room however wouldn’t get natural sunlight (the windows were on my brothers side of the room) so my parents decided to put in a window between them so light could shine through both rooms. Keep this in mind as it is important for the story.\n\nAbout a year ago I was home from school one day feeling a bit sick and so I was left alone in our apartment. I had just woken up, taken a shower and eaten breakfast when I heard what sounded like footsteps coming from the direction of my siblings rooms. While it initially creeped me out a bit I just chalked it up to the neighbours being loud or me making things up. \n\nI then went to brush my teeth, thinking nothing of it. Our bathroom is parallel to my siblings room and the door of my sisters room was open so looking in the bathroom mirror I could see into my brothers room from my sisters window. When I finished brushing my teeth I went to spit out my toothpaste, bending down over the sink, and leaving my sisters window out of sight for a split second. When I looked back up I saw something that made my stomach drop.\n\nA large silhouette of a woman who was looking intently at me through my sisters window, standing in my brothers room. As soon as she knew I had noticed her she seem alerted and quickly bent down out of sight. In a panic i rushed out of the bathroom, ran into the kitchen and took a knife to defend myself. Fearing someone had broken in I yelled out: “Who are you?” No response.\n\nAt that point I gathered the courage to shakily make my way over to my brothers room, knife in hand, to confront whatever it was who was in my home. I put my ear up to his door, waited a couple of seconds, and then I shit you not, I heard a raspy breathing on the other side. It sounded like someone dying and desperately sucking after air. (Think the sound bonnie and chica make in fnaf 1 when they stand outside your door.)\n\nSafe to say I noped out of there immediately and locked myself in my room. I called my parents and told them what happened and they sounded concerned, and then my dad said something that hadn’t even slipped my mind. “But that window is over 2 meters (6.5 feet) high” \n\nWhatever thing this was had to be the tallest woman on earth as it (yes it) had to hunch over to look through the window. I stayed in my room until my parents came home and when looking through the apartment they didnt find anything. \n\nTo this day I try to stay away from my brothers room at all costs and I always close the door when I’m brushing my teeth. I’m not trying my chances with whatever the hell that thing is.\n\nMaybe I’m just crazy but I have never had any other paranormal experience in my life and this was so vividly real that I genuinely cannot explain it.",

        "text": "What are everyone’s thoughts / beliefs about mirrors facing the bed while they sleep??\n\nIt’s the Christmas holidays and we’ve travelled back home, staying at my partners Nan’s house. The room we’re staying in has a mirror in it facing the bed! Reminded me that when I was little my sister said she was sleeping at a friends and saw something in a mirror that was facing their bed and it was a common occurrence. From there I have NEVER slept with a mirror in front of my bed.\n\nSo on this trip I have turned the mirror sideways but my partner and his mother keep moving it back without me knowing. One night here I had sleep paralysis and I haven’t had this for years!!. Then I keep waking up just randomly feeling super worried for some reason and have realised the mirror is back to normal facing the bed. Trust me I have a 7 month old baby and once I fall asleep that’s me until my baby wakes up - I want as much sleep as I can get - so I never wake up when my baby isn’t awake… \n\nSuper frustrating anyway it’ll be cool to see what everyone else’s beliefs / thoughts are about this",
