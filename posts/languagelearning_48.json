        "text": "We have high hopes for raising our daughter (2 years) as a polyglot. \n\nAt the moment her only lessons are YouTube Spanish for kids (StoryZoo, Rock N Learn, Calico Spanish) and she absolutely loves it. She gets an hour of screens per day, 30 minutes of language and 30 of entertainment. \n\nOur goals are Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin- then wherever the journey takes us from there. \n\nMy partner and I are native English speakers, I seem to pick up languages well so I'm mostly leading the way and he is good with Dutch (his ancestry) but has minimal commitment to it at the moment. I am mostly committed to Spanish and Mandarin, and am learning both at once (one in the morning, one at night, about 30 minutes each). I would personally love to become a polyglot and would appreciate advice on the easiest first languages from english, the best ways to learn, formal vs informal study, tutors, etc. (For me and for daughter)\n\nI'm looking for the best possible tactics to raise our daughter with these languages. We have access to a Mandarin daycare though not sure about their availability, will likely be available when she's 3 or 4. This is less desirable because I would like to immerse her in language ASAP. There are Mandarin and Spanish classes available which go for an hour per day but I would likely get a tutor instead (if recommended) so they can come to our home and teach her in her environment. Would this be better than going to a \"special\" place specifically for language?\n\nWe're committed to doing OPOL once we're fluent in the Spanish and Dutch, though I'm hearing that it's not the best idea as we're not native speakers.\n\nIs it best for her to learn one at a time with full immersion? Will it confuse her to do multiple? I know kids are sponges and the first 3-5 years are the best time for language so I'm looking to commit to best practice. \n\nAny and all advice appreciated, especially from those who have succeeded with their learning goals!",

        "text": "This is NOT a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing motivation, what do I do? :(‚Äú post. I just want to hear your stories, and share some thoughts. :)\n\n\n\nFor me, I‚Äôm intermediate at Japanese and about an A2 at French. For Japanese, I loved and continue to love every minute of learning. I‚Äôve never been frustrated at mixing up similar characters, and love writing out kanji to practice. Japanese media I‚Äôm interested in is abundant, and Im at a level where I can quite organically enjoy a good chunk of those. The sentence structure, while not linguistically related to my native language, has certain similarities that make it feel familiar - I like this not just from the point of view of it being easy to learn and remember, but‚Ä¶ sort of emotionally too? It‚Äôs too strong of a word :p But the point is, a very pleasant experience overall, that never felt like work.\n\n\n\nFor French, however, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever enjoyed the journey. What I ultimately want to do is enjoy French literature. I‚Äôm a lit major, and whatever I‚Äôve read in translation, I‚Äôve absolutely adored, both more recent 21st century works, as well as older ones from the 19th. Of course, this is out of my reach for now. I can maybe stumble through this with a dictionary, but it‚Äôs not going to be very productive. The homophones become irritating, the r sound is too difficult to reproduce reliably, and the elisions start to feel like they‚Äôre victimising me personally.\n\n\nI speak two languages natively, learned a third in school, and learned Japanese for myself, so I KNOW the kind of work I‚Äôm looking at to reach the level of ‚Äúcan appreciate literature‚Äù, even in a relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù language for English speakers like French. On one hand, this is a hobby that‚Äôs supposed to be fun, and on the other I know I‚Äôll be very happy with myself if in 10 years, if I can finally read and enjoy those novels that aren‚Äôt translated!\n\n\nSo I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll diligently plod along through this course I‚Äôm using, which promises to deposit me at the B1 level, and then reevaluate. until then, I‚Äôm not going out of my way to practice French with material that doesn‚Äôt interest me just because it‚Äôs at my level! I‚Äôve got French subtitles on in Netflix wherever it‚Äôs available, and I watch some French YouTube recommendations and stop at the points I feel like. Again, I know this won‚Äôt make me fluent, but hobby, fun, etc. \n\n\nI really do want to learn, I love how French looks and sounds when I‚Äôm not desperately trying to understand a mind numbing sentence. (And as a bonus, my mother loves baking and would love to go visit some French bakeries one day. It would be a dream if I could take her and navigate us around with no issues!)\n\n\n\nSo yes, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people here talk about wanting to use their TLs to work in translation, to move to and live in another country, to converse with their partner‚Äôs families‚Ä¶ very advanced goals! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a human on earth who can handle the kind of delayed gratification that is language learning, not without some rewards through the middle. What are those rewards for you? \n\n\nAnd do feel free to disagree, it might help me shake up my current feelings towards my French studies.",

First of all, most textbooks or courses stop here. You are completely on your own. And I don't want to view language learning as just \"mindless entertainment but in another language\". I want to make measurable progress with clearly defined goals. But what is there to clearly define? Not much in my opinion. You just need a huge amount of hours of being immersed and working with the language to encounter all the words and idioms enough times to internalize them.  \n\nSo what goals can I set?  \nRead another 50 books? Watch another 100 movies? Speak 1 hour with a tutor every week? Write a diary every day?  \nIt just all seems so unspecific. What exactly are those things going to achieve? There will be improvement, that's for sure, but this improvement is gonna be unquantifiable in the end. And it's gonna be a long, drawn-out process without a clear end in sight. Which makes this whole endeavor rather frustrating.  \nLet me know how you managed to set goals after B2 and if not, how you managed to work around that.",

It's called [Bardo AI Summarizer ü§ñ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bardo-ai-summarizer-%F0%9F%A4%96/onlpmnflmhlbpejafdjmilndndmfoljb).\n\nWith it, you can easily get a summary of any text written in one of the most popular languages, translated into English. All you have to do is highlight the text and click the extension icon. The summary will include the main points and key words translated into English, which makes it easier to understand texts that might be otherwise challenging.\n\nI created Bardo to help myself and others improve language skills, and I'm excited to share it with the community. If you try it out, I'd love to hear your feedback. You can find the extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bardo-ai-summarizer-%F0%9F%A4%96/onlpmnflmhlbpejafdjmilndndmfoljb) and give it a shot to see how it can make reading and understanding texts in a foreign language a breeze!",

        "text": "Next year I will take the DELE C1 exam in Spanish, which tests your ability to read, write, speak and listen at a high level. You have to actively know a lot of vocab, and of course you need to know grammar inside out. I am getting a lot of practice with reading (on Reddit and other places online), listening (telenovelas and other TV shows) and speaking (I have a lot of Spanish-speaking friends).\n\nGiven my practice in the other three skills, it seems to me that my weakest skill by far is writing. Whenever I try to write most things in Spanish, I find myself reaching for my phone to look up words in the dictionary. I feel like I should be well past that, since when I'm speaking I usually find a way to rephrase things to avoid words I don't actively remember. But with writing my mind somehow draws a blank.\n\nI've been trying to think of ways to practice this, like writing short stories, but everything I can think of would require a native speaker to constantly give me feedback, and I don't want to annoy my friends asking them to rate my latest Spanish essay. Has anyone figured out how to get over this hurdle? The one good thing is that the DELE exam grades active skills (writing and speaking) together, so if the oral exam is good I can pass with relatively sub-par writing. Thanks.",
