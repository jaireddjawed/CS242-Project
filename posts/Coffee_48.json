How different companies source beans? About any other aspects of running or working for a coffee business? Well, ask your questions here! Think of this as an AUA directed at the back room of the coffee industry.\n\nThis may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.\n\nIndustry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post \"I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.\n\nWhile you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.\n\nPlease keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from \"the experts,\" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here. For more general coffee questions, e.g. brew methods, gear recommendations for home brewing, etc, please ask in the daily Question Thread.",

The felt washer at the bottom of the impeller was almost fully torn but I left it in. Amount of coffee grinds was the same. 18g at 13.2 secs, 14 size. However I noticed the grounds scatter all over the place. Then another piece of wood got stuck (bean supplier wth). Did another deep clean. Threw away the now torn felt washer. Realized felt washer cost so much so I watched a video on how to make a DIY felt washer using synthetic chamois. Made it close as I can to the spec.\n\nNow the grinder takes close to 30 seconds to produce the same amount of coffee. I tried running it without the DIY washer and its still less coffee. Even at the coarsest setting the coffee grounds coming out of the chute is less.\n\nIs the felt washer really important to the amount of grind coming out of the chute? Could it be a clog? I tried blowing air through the chute with a straw both from the top and bottom.",

I've been having a pretty big learning curve with the milk frothing part and am getting quite confused with the whole stretching thing. \n\nI know i can google/youtube the ratios but thought I'd see if there was something readily available.

I'm pretty happy with the steam wand, I am still figuring out how to dial in the coffee side of things. Everything has tasted pretty good so far but I'm just kinda winging it while figuring out what works.

Does anyone have any recommendations within the following criteria?:\n\n\\- Automatic\n\n\\- Max. 300€ (could go further if the product and provider is really great)\n\n\\- Used mainly for brewing filter coffee in my sage precision (no espresso grind needed)\n\n\\- Ease of maintenance and cleaning \n\n\\- Good experience with the manufacturer in terms of customer service, repairs and parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany thanks in advance for any tips!",

        "text": " I am qQuite new to the coffee consumption with more care and quite old to the regular brainless, careless coffee consumption on a daily search for a caffeine shot that keeps me going.\n\nWhat was the wake up call? The failing of my Nespresso machine at home and the search to buy a new Nespresso machine to keep getting my daily dose of half-assed, always the same, not so interesting shot of espresso.\n\nEnters the idea of \"but why capsules?\" Is it really that hard to use a regular espresso machine? That way I can buy coffee in a greater variety of places and with a far, far greater less amount of packaging! It really started to grind my gears the idea of buying single package of either plastic or aluminum for every 5 or 7 g of coffee!\n\nSome notes here, I live in Portugal, where the word coffee is, for the most part, synonym to espresso. If you go to a regular cafe and just ask for a coffee, that’s the default. A short shot of a (usually) good strong espresso. Also, most people (me included) I know have a moka pot at home to brew coffee to get with milk for breakfast.\n\nSo, I'm used to buy and consume Nespresso compatible capsules, like Buondi, or Nespresso, for espresso and supermarket pre ground (national brand mostly - Sical) for moka pot. Those are my current standards.\n\nBoy, was I in for a treat when I came here searching for recommendations on buying a fairly cheap, but capable espresso machine....\n\nBut I'm not here to ask you guys to recommend Gaggia Classic to me, that ship has sailed already, and I (sadly) got a fairly bad Breville mini (UK). It has pressurized 58mm baskets, so espressos are not bad. Milk drinks, like \"meia de leite\", you guys would call it latte, or cappuccino, or flat white (not sure which is which), are OK, I guess. Espresso is the focus here.\n\nWhat I'm looking for, is for guidance on the path ahead. \n\nFirst step already taken, was to find regional roasters and small specialty caffes that sell freshly roasted and milled to order. Found a couple of them and, quite a lot more than I was expecting! Ordered two types, one for moka and one for espresso, but not yet arrived, can´t tell if I will notice a big difference from the supermarket coffee I’m used to.\n\nBudget is limited, so I must choose carefully which steps to take, to maximize what I already have and how to make the most of it. \n\nNow I am considering getting a hand grinder that I can use both for moka and espresso. I understand that with the pressurized baskets, grind size isn’t paramount, but in time, I’m hoping to change the machine so I will buy for today but thinking on the tomorrow.\n\nBesides that, what are the things that really have the biggest impact on the quality of coffee you can brew at home? Is it which MokaPot you have? Is it the quality of the coffee you buy? Is it the grind quality? Is it freshness of roast? The freshness of grind? The water? The technique used? \n\nThere are so many things to consider, I really want to set a path of priorities to plan ahead and spread out the effort and maximize the benefits!\n\nThanks for all the help I can get!",

Then I realized that there were plenty of videos on the web that taught this way of making cappuccinos (which has nothing to do with what we call a cappuccino in Italy or Austria). \n\nWhat went wrong? I mean, if people enjoy weak coffee with latte art, that is fine, but why do they call it a cappucinno when it is not, and why is it now impossible to get a real cappuccino in trendy cafés?",

High quality (so many nice electric kettles I've looked at get bad reviews, but I trust y'all)\n3. No gooseneck (she doesn't like how they look/worries it will fill her 1L FP too slowly)\n4.

There’s was nothing wrong with it.\n\nBut I did get to play with my volt meter and now it’s a lot cleaner!\n\nI never made that cup of coffee though.

I’ve watched a lot of technique videos and know to fill up the basket and not tamp the grounds when brewing. But the filter basket… it’s really difficult to get out after I’m done. The only way I’ve been able to get it out even after letting it cool is to use a butter knife or fork to dig under the puck and pry the basket up on one edge, but even then it’s such a small gap that it’s hard to keep a separate knife or my fingers in place to pull the basket out, especially if it’s still hot. But this leads to grounds spilling over onto the counter and it’s just a hassle. How do you experienced folks do this? Is there a trick to it? I don’t want to accidentally bang the filter into the trash especially if I’m going to brew again for more servings and besides there’s usually been extra water in the bottom section so tipping it over on its side doesn’t seem like any more of a mess free option than clumsily digging through the used ground to pry it out.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/zwqqhv/how_to_asked_chatgpt_to_tell_me_how_to_make_a/",
        "text": "Prompt 1: \"give me directions on how to make a delicious cappucino, assuming that I don't have any equipment and will need to purchase some to start with.\"\n\nChatGPT Response:\n\n&gt; To make a cappuccino at home, you will need to purchase or gather the following equipment:\n\n&gt; Espresso machine: This is the most important piece of equipment for making a cappuccino. An espresso machine will allow you to extract espresso shots, which are the base of a cappuccino.\n\n&gt; Grinder: You will need a good quality coffee grinder to grind your beans to the right consistency for making espresso.\n\n&gt; Tamper: A tamper is a tool that is used to compress the ground coffee in the portafilter of the espresso machine.\n\n&gt; Milk frother: A milk frother is a tool that is used to steam and froth milk for cappuccinos and lattes.\n\n&gt; Measuring cups and spoons: You will need measuring cups and spoons to accurately measure the ingredients for your cappuccino.\n\n&gt; Once you have gathered all of your equipment, follow these steps to make a delicious cappuccino:\n\n&gt; Grind your coffee beans and measure out the right amount for your espresso shot.\n\n&gt; Load the ground coffee into the portafilter and tamp it down using your tamper.\n\n&gt; Place the portafilter into the espresso machine and extract a shot of espresso.\n\n&gt; Pour a small amount of milk into the milk frother and turn it on. Hold the frother wand just below the surface of the milk and move it around in a circular motion until the milk is frothed and heated to the desired temperature.\n\n&gt; Pour the frothed milk into the espresso shot and top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or chocolate shavings if desired. Serve immediately. Enjoy!\n\nPrompt 2: \"how much is the right amount of beans?\"\n\nChatGPT Response: \n\n&gt; The right amount of coffee beans for a cappuccino will depend on the size of your espresso machine and the strength of the coffee that you prefer. As a general rule, you should aim for about 7 grams of coffee beans per 1-ounce (30-milliliter) shot of espresso. So, if you are making a cappuccino that calls for a single shot of espresso, you will need about 7 grams of coffee beans.\n\n&gt; Here is a rough guide to help you measure the right amount of beans for different cappuccino sizes:\n\n&gt; For a small cappuccino (8 ounces): 1 shot of espresso (7 grams of beans)\n\n&gt; For a medium cappuccino (12 ounces): 1.5 shots of espresso (10.5 grams of beans)\n\n&gt; For a large cappuccino (16 ounces): 2 shots of espresso (14 grams of beans)\n\n&gt; Keep in mind that these are rough estimates and you may need to adjust the amount of beans slightly to achieve the desired strength and flavor of your cappuccino. Experimenting with different ratios of espresso to milk and adjusting the amount of beans that you use can help you find the perfect cappuccino recipe for your taste preferences.\n\nPrompt 3: \"Does it matter what kind of beans I use?\"\n\nChatGPT response: \n\n&gt; Yes, the type of coffee beans that you use can have a significant impact on the flavor and overall quality of your cappuccino. Different types of beans will have different flavor profiles, roast levels, and acidity levels, which can all affect the taste of your cappuccino.\n\n&gt; For a traditional cappuccino, it is best to use high-quality espresso beans. These beans are specifically roasted and blended for use in espresso-based drinks and have a strong, bold flavor that works well with the frothed milk of a cappuccino. Look for beans that are labeled as \"espresso\" or \"for espresso\" when shopping for your cappuccino.\n\n&gt; In general, it is a good idea to choose beans that are fresh, roasted within the past week or two, and come from a reputable source. Fresh beans will have a better flavor and aroma than older, stale beans. It is also a good idea to choose beans that are roasted to a medium or dark roast level, as these tend to have a stronger, more robust flavor that works well in a cappuccino.\n\n&gt; Ultimately, the best beans for your cappuccino will depend on your personal taste preferences. Experimenting with different types of beans and roasts can help you find the perfect beans for your cappuccino.",

I opted for the DeLonghi Magnifica based on decent reviews and it being very similar to one I use regularly at work which makes really nice coffee (by my taste at least).\n\nSo playing around setting it up today I'm having trouble getting decent results. The taste is very watery and mild even though I'm using it on nearly the max strength setting. However, on the \"long\" setting it starts and stops when pouring and only produces a small amount of coffee in the cup.  The instruction manual says that this is because the coffee is set to grind too fine, but I have it on the most course setting which is probably why it tastes crap. \n\nTo me this means there must be something up with the grinder. I found an old threat saying it might need cleaning, but the machine is brand new so this can't be the issue.  The beans should be fine too as I've been using them and getting decent results making coffee manually.\n\n\nTl;Dr\nThe machine is struggling because the ground is too fine, but it's on the most course setting. Coffee is weak and watery because of the course setting",

You may even remember that Oatly's corporate marketing department even got involved and cracked out their bag of 'anti establishment' messages. \n\nWell, sadly for Oatly they are back in the establishment with these rule changes. *Milk drinks can now be prepared with milk alternatives.*\n\nAs for the other changes, the most significant change is allow fully automatic machines to enter in the awards for best machine.

There's barely any bitterness and hint of acidity that isn't normally there. The finish is sweet and soft and without as much chocolate. I tried dropping back to 65 with cooler water and it's immediately harsh and bitter again. At 60g/l 60 clicks would be similarly harsh and awful, even at cooler temperatures.\n\nI'm not really sure what's going on here. It's like there's a \"hump\" in extraction where things taste harsher and harsher and harsher then suddenly MUCH better.   \n\nMy best guess is that I'm just hitting a point where there's enough sweetness in the cup to *counteract* the bitterness and roasty notes, but it seems unusual that I'm not getting any dominant acidity or other classically under-extracted notes at coarser settings or with cooler water.  \n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "One of my friends, let’s just call him M, owns a coffee shop which I frequent and he has always been happy to share the auction lot samples that he bought with me and discuss his roasts and learn what I think of them.\n\nYesterday, I went to his shop with two friends, let’s call them C, to pick up some CGLE auction samples that M wanted to share and noticed that he recently purchased a new grinder (Compak PK100 Lab). Interested to see if different grinders make easily noticeable difference to brews, I ask M if he could brew the same bean using the same formula with only the grinder being the variable. M was happy to oblige.\n\nMoments late, M brought forth two servers of this years Ethiopia COE #9, one filled with coffee grounded using C40, the other with coffee grounded using PK100 Lab. We also asked to borrow M’s Nucleus Compass Beverage Thermometer so we can better quantify the difference between the brews. \n\nAt the temperature that the coffee was served in (IIRC around 60 Celsius), the coffee made using C40 had a noticeably fruitier and more acidic taste than the one made from PK100. The C40 produced a cup that was more aligned with the stereotypical fruity/floral/delicate nature of Ethiopian specialty coffee while the PK100’s cup felt more muted with a slight woody/cereal note. Our second temperature check occurred around 45 Celsius. To the group, the 45-50 range was the ideal temperature range for the coffee. The C40’s brew began to show more sweetness and jasmine-tea characteristics while the PK100’s brew began to show more acidity and fruit notes. Our last temperature check was when the coffee cooled to roughly 25 Celsius. At this temperature, the C40’s brew starts to feel like it has less body than the PK100 and the separation between notes was less obvious.\n\nOverall, the group consensus was that, at hot/warm temperatures, the C40 performed better than the PK100 to our palates since it produced fruitier. The PK100, on the other hand , performed better for slightly above room temperature coffee. We later retested our hypothesis with a blind tasting of another COE sample and got the same results.\n\nWe also tried a sample of this year’s COE #2 and compared notes. C told me that based onhis memory of the bean, which he brewed at home with his Eureka Mignon \n, it tasted more anaerobic. My version at home made with C40 tasted fruity and acidic. M’s version  with PK100 had that woody note.  However, this comparison of notes was not as controlled as the previous two since there are more variables that might be different when brewing coffee at home.\n\nAdmittedly, M tells us the the PK100 was banged around by the shipping company during transport and was not properly calibrated beyond grind size after it’s arrival, however it is still interesting to see how big of a noticeable difference grinders make to the final brew.",
