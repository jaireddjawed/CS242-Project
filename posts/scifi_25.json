        "text": "I'm planning to do a one-off short film set in the world of [JijiColony](https://jijicolony.com/) (a sci-fi web series about life on an interstellar colony ship). I'd love your feedback on which concept sounds most interesting to you!\n\n**Short film #1:** A senior engineer on board a colony ship tries to coach a terrified junior engineer through a panic attack on her first extravehicular mission to manually repair a failed life-support system that could put the whole ship at risk. \n\n**Short film #2:** After leaving Earth, a filmmaker on board a colony ship documents his girlfriend's descent into anxiety and paranoia as she researches the colony’s government and becomes increasingly convinced that the whole mission is a brutal conspiracy.\n\n**Short film #3:** A human and his android girlfriend must navigate the challenges of maintaining her functionality—and their relationship—as they travel far from Earth on a colony ship with limited resources.\n\nYour feedback would be super helpful in deciding which one to work on this year. Thank you!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10fav93)",

I have no idea how that one slipped past me, as movies like John Carpenters “The Thing” and the Alien movies, are my two absolute favourites \nRegardless is there any other lovecraft movies out there that are similar? (Or even any other movies that aren’t Lovecraft that are like that?) Are they all like that? I totally fell in love with everything about it and it is now at the top of my list of intense, weird sci-fi flicks. \nPlease discuss! Lol",

If you have enough time, you have a decent chance of being able to tell the story (although a lot of adaptation doesn't actually try to tell the story).\n\nWe get into problems with movies; unless it's a really simple book, it isn't enough time. Short stories and novella length works, otoh, can fit well. Ender's Game is a great example. Tbe movie doesn't have enough run time to truly tell the story of the novel, but they could have done an excellent job on the original short story.. I am not saying \"Ender's Game\" is a bad movie. I am saying that it misses enough of the book to bother me, different thing.  I'd really like to see Larry Niven's \"Rammer\" attempted. As a movie. :-)\n\nIf you want to do a novel and do it justice, you neef the 450 minutes in 10 episodes  Doing Dune in 2 movies is smart, and so far they haven't left much out...but...\n... I'm not really feeling it. It's missing depth, detail, the human intricacy. And damn it, I want it to. The Director got the shots, the editor did good work, and to me it feels thin.\n\nOkay, target 🎯 on my back. :-)",

If a society accepts all the millions of aliens that are out there, then the Cult’s more alien operatives could show themselves in public without causing a stir. A decentralized civilization won’t be able to figure out what’s going on before things have gotten too far, and many core regions may find themselves completely isolated and left to defeat the Cult alone. One more key factor would be class differences and disparities within the society, than Cults are masters at exploiting.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

        "text": "Humanity had just figured out faster than light travel only a decade ago and this was the first space vessel to attempt to find new life. There had been generational ships sent to Gliese 667 Cc these had been massive undertakings, kilometers long, supporting hundreds of thousands of people, animals and flora. The idea being that the people who arrived would be the descendants of the first crew with a ship that would be totally self sufficient.\n\nThis ship I’m currently watching for is new, its faster, smaller, and so advanced no one person can really understand everything in it. Like the AI. Today is the third day of my eight weeks alone each crew member has a watch, two weeks with the previous watch, eight weeks alone, and two weeks with the next. The idea was that if theres only ever one or two people awake while the others are in stasis then the drag on life support and the farms would allow our ship to last for decades or centuries before it would need to be resupplied. My two weeks with Jeff, the man on watch before me was uneventful. Ship was fine and on course, no new signals or anything like that. AI was behaving itself. But something isn’t right now. Shadows where there shouldn’t be shadows, noises from across the room or ceiling, I swear a potato I was going to eat disappeared. I told the ship AI to watch my ration intake and the oxygen levels to see if anything pops up.\n\nToday is the tenth day of my watch. My shadow isn’t right. My meals taste….. odd? A potato is a potato it should taste like what I put on it but there’s a potato flavor now. My meat is tougher than it should be even after I recalibrated the grower. My ribeye had the consistency of a heart. I’m also leaving footprints which shouldn’t be possible. There’s no dirt on this ship.\n\nFifteenth day. I miss Jeff.\n\nSixteenth day. I saw something. I remembered that I asked the ship to watch oxygen and other ration supplies and I’m not totally crazy. Everything seems to be about 10% higher than it should be. Now, that COULD be because I’m stressed and over eating and breathing harder all the time…. Or it could be something else, and I saw a something else. Okay well I didn’t *see* anything but I did find a hair. It looks like a cat hair or a dog hair but while we do have pets on board they’re all in stasis right now. I put it in the analyzer to find out what it was. I’m going to watch a Lord of the Rings marathon to calm myself down.\n\nTwentieth day. So I’m a dumb ass and totally forgot about that hair. It isn’t human, dog, cat, cow, rat, bat, mouse, chicken, crow, eagle, fish, octopus, nothing. This hair isn’t from earth. I’m rerunning the scan because we haven’t dropped out of FTL for a year now except for one, one hour hiccup a few rotations ago but no one has mentioned or noticed anything. I checked the external cameras and there is something out there that looks like it might be weird, but it could be nothing. I need to sit on this, take a bath, get a drink, maybe a nap. After that I need to ask the AI to refresh my memory on the exact procedure to wake someone up early.\n\nTwenty third day. I’ve run the DNA analyzer at least three more times and every time it comes up as “unknown.” I need to wake up the Captain.\n\nThirty fifth day. No new findings, everything normal. Slight route deviation and small stop planned for tomorrow. Can’t wait for my shift to end.\n\nForty-first day. Can’t wait to wake up Jessica and get some human interaction, I’ve been getting really tired recently. Kinda like how Jeff was.",

The warp drive malfunctions randomly (you can see a shadow person in the back of the frame or shot not moving) \n\nWhen they land on the planet it looks exactly like earth with all of our cities and everything.. except there are no people. No animals.. no life at all.. its very liminal space looking or like the backrooms.. very glitchy looking you can hear sounds of birds or people talking at cafes and such.. but theres nobody around no movement at all except the crew \n\nThey all get lost in maze like enviroments as they venture deeper into the world atrempting to record everything.. very trippy stuff and confusing camera work with changing layouts as they backtrack \n\nWe follow around the same protagonist the whole time the engineer \n\nIn almost every scene theres a shadow person in the background giving off the vibe that theyre being watched? Shadow people never do anything the whole movie \n\nHe ends up going down a dark hallway where he hears running noises but theres nothing around he can see with the flashlight as if theres a prerecorded audio playing like everywhere else that doesnt make sense.. and then randomly wakes up from some strange machine.. \n\nHe wakes up in what looks like some dystopian system that looks futuristic and ancient at the same time.. and there are trillions of humans in similar machines all over the place.. \n\nHe wakes up and the ai awakes and detected there was an error. The ai will try to put him back in the simulation but shows recording or holographic displays of what hes on.. there are hundreds of these rings surrounding a white dwarf on the edge of a black hole",
