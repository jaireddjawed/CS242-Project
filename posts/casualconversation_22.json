Are those scams even offering something people *want*?\n\nI'm a *really* big fan of Star Wars, but when I receive clothing, I'm mostly just happy to be given something. Happier still, if it's something that fits well. I like getting clothes as gifts or for a good price, but the design itself barely matters to me.\n\nI do like other forms of merchandise, such as Star Wars cookbooks. As for clothing though, I don't really care. Especially since the licensed stuff is often sold for much more, I'd rather get a $3 shirt than a new $15 Star Wars one.\n\nAnyone else feel that way? Do you like wearing merch for franchises you love? And has it changed much with age? When I was in kindergarten, it'd matter to me if Spider-Man was on something, not so much anymore",

They post personal information and photos online without thinking about how it could be used maliciously against them. They believe what somebody else says without verifying whether it is an opinion or fact; this is the type of behavior I expect from my elderly parents. but not from someone who is in their twenties. I am not generalizing; I'm only speaking from my personal experience. Many of the kids of my friends don't know the basic functions of a computer or phone, and now that they're legally adults, having finished high school and working, they're asking for help like my elderly parents. like they cannot understand simple things. Just because you have a Wi-Fi signal on your phone doesn't mean you have internet because the provider is down. They don't even know the difference between SMS and WhatsApp, where one uses GSM to access the internet and the other uses Wi-Fi, which works separately. The only reason this came up is because one of them was trying to send a message using SMS, and she was complaining that she had internet but could not send an SMS. I had to tell her that she needed credit on her phone to send SMS because it used a different network.\n\nI'm not a young man myself; I'm almost 40. and I'm worried for those kids growing up into adulthood, as they don't know how to troubleshoot a problem with something that they use daily. I assumed that at my age, the younger generation would teach me something I didn't know, rather than the other way around. Instead, I'm utterly shocked at the lack of knowledge they have.\n\nAgain, I'm not bashing them, but this is my observation, and I believe computer education needs to come back as well as online safety classes. It is a necessity for the next generation in a tech world that is being dominated by advancements in AI. because if you understand how it works, it can improve your skill, but if you don't, it will dumb you down, and I am worried for the future of this current generation.\n\nor perhaps I'm speaking too soon, but I'm seeing this in my personal experience as well as online with the number of things I have to help them troubleshoot very basic things.

        "text": "I was a dorky, quiet kid in high school who didn't have too many friends. I got good grades and even owned a little pool cleaning business.  I never had a girlfriend in those days either, every girl I asked to a dance would shoot me down.  I went to college and had only 2 girlfriends, who honestly, weren't that great. \n\nGrowing up, everyone would tell me I'd be getting more girlfriends when I'm successful and in my 30's. Well, I'm now successful and in my 30's and not much has changed for my social/love life. I've dated, but have not been in an actual relationship since college, and I have only a few friends.  \n\nI don't look bad, I excercise regularly, I have my own place and vehicle, and I own a company that's doing well. I did quit drinking last year, so I don't go out much to dive bars, and I hate the club scene. I'm actually just working most of the time, and I do have a stutter; those are the only things I can think of that would negatively impact my social/love life. I've also tried those dating apps and they've been terrible to say the least.\n\nAnyway, it seems like the people who were just average or cool in their younger years have just as many friends and get just as many girlfriends as they always have. What has your experience been and has this been the case with you guys?",

        "text": "A friend had divorced her husband. She had discovered, while pregnant with their first child, that he was having an affair. One month after she gave birth, he moved out. He and the girlfriend were seen all around town. On weekends when he had the baby, people would see them out with the girlfriend, treating the baby like he was hers.\n\nMy friend‚Äôs ex would not leave her alone. He wanted the girlfriend, but he also wanted his ex. After eighteen months of this, my friend called me. She was going to remarry him. She asked me what I thought. I knew she wanted her family back together. But I knew he couldn‚Äôt be trusted.\n\nSo I hedged my answer. I asked her, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to think when he comes home late from the gym? (That was where he met the girlfriend) What are you going to think when he starts walking outside to talk on his phone? What are you going to think when you call his office and his secretary can‚Äôt tell you where he is? And he isn‚Äôt answering your calls? Please, please just consider all this.‚Äù\n\nShe told me she would. Then she went with him to the local Justice of the Peace, and for the second time, married him.\n\nThey moved into a beautiful new home. There were hiccups. Basically, his drinking. But they stuck it out. She got pregnant. Triplets.\n\nA few years later, I got the call. She was seeing the signs. Going outside to take phone calls. Disappearing from work. Not taking her calls.\n\nShe figured out who the girlfriend was. She filed for divorce. What made it worse was, she discovered he had been having multiple ‚Äúmini‚Äù flings with various women. All whom she knew.\n\nDuring a conversation with her, she asked me, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you stop me from remarrying him?‚Äù\n\nI told her the truth. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want to hear it.‚Äù",

        "text": "My husband (35) and I (34) are parents of 3 children. A son who is 15 and 2 twin daughters that are 12. my husband is an incredible father to our family. Our youngest daughters are autistic, and they've completely been daddy's girl ever since they were born. It's been insanely difficult to separate the girls from their father, they love each other so much. The girls are wonderful, beautiful and intelligent kids, everyday i fall in love with the incredible things they do. Them being autistic has given them a few complications throughout their life. They're both very different from one another. \n\nTwin A is very hyperactive, struggles sometimes to be focused on certain tasks/activities that she's doing. She isn't a nervous girl and loves meeting new people. Twin B is quite different. She has anxiety and is easily scared in many situations, in which my husband helps her so much. She has speech and writing difficulties, which as well affects her being able to fully concentrate. Her emotions/mood can change instantly, and at times can struggle to sleep. \n\nWith that being said, my husband and i have done everything we can to to help them with anything they need. My husband turned our extra empty room into a classroom, so we can help the girls with their school work &amp; especially help twin B with her writing difficulties. These things I love so much, as I also see this as a way for me to spend time with my daughters. This hasn't been entirely successful, as they never want me to do anything with them. They don't let me help them with their homework, doesn't let me teach them - they ALWAYS wants their dad, even tells me they'll wait for him to come home to help them with their homework. My daughters are insanely comfortable with their father, but I wish they felt the same way with me. \n\nTwin B sometimes cries at night, she's afraid of the dark and always wants her dad next to her. I've gone to her multiple times to comfort her, but she always tells me \"call dad, please call him\" and she doesn't want my comfort. My husband of course rushes to the rescue to be with her, kissing her on the cheeks and telling her everything will be okay. And me? I'm standing there just looking because I have no idea what to do. My husband tells her \"let mom give you a hug\" but she never let's go of her father. I know she not trying to be rude or mean, because I know she's found a safe person with her dad. But it sucks, that my own daughter loves her dad more. \n\nAnd twin A is very protective of twin B. She doesn't like seeing her sister crying or sad. So before my husband shows up to comfort twin B, twin A is already making sure she's doing well. I wish I was able to do that with her, but it's still beautiful to see twin A being a loving sibling.\n\nThey also never approach me for anything. When they had their first period, who did the tell? Their dad. When something happens at school, who do they tell? Their dad. When they're hungry or wants any support, who does they tell? My husband. Every time we all get together to watch a movie at home, they always wrap their arms/cuddle with their father. My son is always with me (he's more attached to me) but I really want my daughters to come with me as well. They never let go of their father, they have so much love and feel protected with him.\n\nNow my husband always brings me in with them, getting me invovled during their cuddles together, leaving me with them so I can spend time with them &amp; I really appreciate that he doesn't push me to the side. But I wish my daughters came on their own, I feel like I did something wrong or something but I definitely didn't.\n\nI love my daughters with all my heart, and my husband always tries to give us opportunities to be together. It doesn't work sometimes, and hearing them say how much they miss my husband when he isn't around hurts sometimes. They do love me though, as my husband told me they have told said they love me so much. Twin A does tell me she loves me, but supposedly twin B is shy &amp; can't express those feelings towards me, like she's afraid of me or something. Not sure why she's afraid, all her life I've always been there for her. My mom says my daughters probably feels safer with their dad, which I won't blame them cause my husband is such a loving person.\n\nHow can I improve my relationship with my daughters? I'll really appreciate your advice on this, as this is something I absolutely would love to improve. My son is very attached to me, and I'll love to have a similar bond with my daughters.",

Looking back at it now, I can be sure that I have done the right thing.\n\nNow, I can be confident to say that I have moved on from that miserable period of my life. I'm in another country different than my hometown, have engaged and interacted with many, many different people, and my opinion in this world isn't as pessimistic as it used to be anymore. I'm nearly finishing my uni program (specialized in tourism and hospitality management, one of the industries that captivates me the most), have a wonderful relationship with my bf and even planned for a long-term future (as far as I can see) with him, which includes moving with and living together with him, a thing considered to be a big deal for an Asian girl like me. I worked through my issues with a therapist, and in return, my relationship with my family also improves significantly, my friends and I have an stronger-than-ever bond even though we only connect to each other through social media, and I'm proud of myself for getting out of that period and be the person that I have always wished to be in the past.\n\nJust want to share that I'm happy to be here, and would like to share this small positive energy to everyone. Have a wonderful day!",

Also, English is not my first language, fyi. \n\nI (29) have been dealing with a health problem a little over 1.5 years now. I had one procedure already 10 days ago and I learnt that I need to have a full surgery soon to make sure I won't have cancer in the future. So yeah I'm not unhealthy but not really heathy either.I live alone. I have a job I like that I can work remotely.  I have reliable friends but although I know I can reach out to them if I feel down, we all have our own lives to lead. I don't want to be too much for them.\n\n.....Which brings me to my question. Would you guys be able to recommend something (anything) I can take up as I recover from the surgery? I'm not supposed to be pushing my body, so nothing physical. I like to play ps4 games but I'm starting to get tired of that, but please let me know if there are any captivating games I might have missed (I finished dragon age inquisition this weekend and it was a lot of fun). I like to play drums (still novice but can't anymore because I'm supposed to take it easy), play guitar (again novice and my guitar sadly broke two weeks ago), love listening to music, reading books too so any fantasy fiction you may propose (stormlight archives is my absolute fav series) or any books discussing philosophy in an easy to read way, please let me know. \n\nWhat I know I definitely would like to do is to socialize somehow but don't know how to do that online. I will feel a lot better if I can meet new people and stay connected. I'm feeling lonely and I guess you can tell already.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my post and for any suggestions!",

All unnecessary spending in the mean time will be kiboshed, (car related expenses and food *not take-out* will remain my only expense in a perfect world).\n\n     Having other roomates is something I would prefer to avoid, but I understand it would be easier to get something cheaper, having a studio apartment or bachelors (I forget the term that describes a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom all in a small area) is my ideal outcome.\n\nAny and all advice appreciated!",

If so, why couldn't scientists track the movement of asteroids for deviations from projected paths, and then calculate the angle from which the asteroid would have been hit to change paths to the new direction, and then trace that line in the direction that the projectile would have come from to get a rough estimate of the area of origin of the projectile? You know, like how cops do their ballistics investigations? It just seems to me like whatever we might do to defend ourselves from space debris, they might have to do, too, even if they normally wouldn't do anything that would get them noticed unless they just had to do it.",

        "text": "I work at a Subway and during my shift today a police officer stopped by in full gear. I asked him how his night was going, and mentioned 'hopefully uneventful', to which his response was that there had been three homicides this week. This was exceptionally alarming as I haven't really seen anything on the news about it, but had recently encountered a squad of about 3 police vehicles with multiple officers on the corner intersection near my apartment rummaging around in some foliage which had collected into a large mass sitting in the ground. One quarter of my local population lives in poverty, with myself riding that line despite having a full time job. However, even with all of that considered, it was a little unexpected. Despite having gotten bigger as a city and there being more businesses opening up, it's still very much a small town. So small, actually, that if you hangout with somebody, and head to a public area, there is a high chance that they either know or are related to somebody else there. A lot of people are born and raised here with a neighboring city of 20 minutes away being considered a \"highlight\", as in, perhaps one day they will visit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of good people here who work, go to school, work two jobs, or some other combination. The cost of living isn't at all relative to the wages earned, however it's considered affordable to many. So plenty of people have moved into the area, or work together as a team in either a bf/gf or roommate scenario, to afford the now $650 - $800 rent, which, in my case, gets you a mold and roach infested unit which was dirty upon move in. As per protocol, I did alert management to the mold problem but had cleaned the unit myself taking photos of the condition before hand. I also bought some roach bait and set them up in hot zones. However, my unit isn't the only one, as this isn't a one time or recent complaint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had recently gone to the gas station near my complex and was solicited, yelled at, and repetitively approached in an aggressive manner by some older white male. He was angry at me for using the ATM to withdraw money from my account because of the fees. He had mentioned 'wanting to work something outüòâ\" with me as to avoid the fees I wasn't complaining about. Mind you this was all in store and on camera with my buddy working the register. I told him he had to leave me alone to which he had moved away at first, but kept yelling from the register. I then moved to the other side of the store and went to my city's online police station to file a report. While doing so, he approached me again, saying that if I was \"going to keep acting this way, \\[he'll\\] just leave!\" He then started calling me crazy and was upset that I had my phone out looking like I was going to call the police. When he left the store I completed the online report and paid for my items. My buddy stepped outside to check on this man, who by the way, in all senses, appeared relatively normal, or at least not cracked out. The man had jotted down some information on a piece of paper for him to give me. He went on to tell my buddy about how he was a millionaire and he's just tryna to...... You can fill in the rest, because that's about as far as it went. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to stress that this man was angry. He was angry and felt entitled to not only my time, but my actions. How dare I, a complete stranger, withdraw money from my account to pay for my bills. It was completely unnecessary. I can't help but feel that this particular instance happened because I was a woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt happens regularly and with different people.\n\nIt is absolutely not a safe area and people feel entitled to YOU. In the past year and a half I've submitted over 30 police reports, of which many of them have recorded audio or occured in a public place on camera. Some don't, because I can't realistically keep my recorder on 24/7, but I have seriously looked into body cams. In regards to self defense in an emergency, I'm not unprepared, to those of you who may suggest something. It's just a lot to deal with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith some of these people, if you don't respond, they get angry as well. It's a lose lose scenario. There are many more stories similar in nature and likely more to come, unfortunately.",

It indicates an expressive personality.\n\nWe discuss a little and she makes some good points regarding my ideas.\nWe joke a bit and she tells me \"If I'll help you then how will I be paid?\"\nI reply \"I'll pay you in hugs\" and she replies \"i really need hugs\"\n\nWe continue talking.\nWe learn we have things in common.\n\nI start to think this person has a similar personality as mine. \n\nIt's very comforting. \n\nI met her after meeting hundreds of girls previously so statistically the more you roll a dice, the closer you get to the desired answer.\n\nWe both want to cuddle each other too.",
