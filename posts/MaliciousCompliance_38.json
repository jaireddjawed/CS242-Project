        "text": "I work at a big box retail store that does price matching. So while we do price match, there are rules. It has to be in stock, it can't be a third party seller, has to be able to be bought without a membership, ect. \n\nI know the cheapest place and the price we can sell it for.\nThe policy is customers have to do the research but sometimes when I am feeling generous, I would just tell them straight up.\n\nA customer is looking at a laptop that is usually around 3.4k before taxes. I tell him straight up I can save him 250. We will give it for the lowest price anywhere. I tell the guy was going to buy it before but I don't make commission so it doesn't matter. I can just press the correct buttons for the price match.\n\nBut now this guy is trying to haggle the price and this just changes my attitude. I am able to sell at the price within policy, not because what I set the price for. \n\nHim: Knock off another $50 man. Or throw in an accessory. You got to help me.\n\nMe: I am already saving you 250 and you still want to haggle over the price?\n\nHim: Man I can get it cheaper elsewhere. Do you really want to lose this sale?\n\nMe: No, but I am not going to lose my job over this.\n\nHim: This is why *store name* is going out of business! You guys don't do anything.\n\nWe are actually doing quite well but that's besides the point  He leaves but deep in my soul I know he was going to come back  Customers will threaten to take their business elsewhere than come back when they realize we are usually selling it for the cheapest plus you get y instantly vs waiting online. I tell my manager and he already knows the deal.\n\nLo and behold, 2 hours later he comes back, probably trying to sweat me out while he had lunch. But I was no longer feeling generous.\n\nMe: So how much did you save ?\n\nHim: Err eh, they didn't have it in stock.\n(We are the only retailer for an hour with this product, let alone cheaper.)\n\nMe: So if you wanted the laptop, it would be 3.4k.\n\nHim: What!? You said you would save me $250! I want you to back up your price match policy.\n\nMe: Well sir, I am sure I can save you that money, but you left to go save more money elsewhere before I had a chance to tell you where you can get that price match. (Passive aggressiveness was so satisfying) And our policy clearly states you have to do your own research.\n\nHim: Get me your manager!\n\nAt this point, my manager knew the game this guy was playing and wasn't having none of that shit. He backed me up and told the customer if he can show us the lower price, wed match it for him. We aren't in the business of selling lower for no reason. The customer could not find the website to save that much money and complained but eventually left. He came back that night to buy it, only saving $100\n\nTLDR: I offered to save a customer a lot of money by price matching for him with my knowledgr but tried\nto play hard to get and then insulted us. When he came back, we told him the policy states he has to do the research and show us the lower price to price match.",

        "text": "So, this is per chance malicious in a different light than the usual.  \nIt's long story, not gonna guarantee an amazing reading experience, so there's a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI like to think of myself as a very nice guy.  \nEverybody gets AT LEAST one chance to be a nice guy before I start looking down on them. And this guy blew his chance entirely.\n\nI am a mailman. I like to think of myself as half-decent at my job, and I take pride when I do my job right.  \nOne of our rules are that we are in no way or fashion supposed to even deal with dogs. It's a simple flowchart.  \nDogs -&gt; No Delivery  \nAnd on a walking route like mine, if you see a loose dog up ahead, you can turn back and just not deliver the rest of the street past the dog. The Post Office will back you up, 100%, because they'd rather pay you to redeliver the mail than to pay you to sit in a hospital with a chunk missing out of your butt.  \nThe struggle is real guys. Unfamiliar dogs really are a mailman's worst nightmare.  \n\nLucky us, we get nice reminder cards to say which houses have problematic dogs.\n\nNow, on the topic of Doggy Defense, as a mailman, you have three easy steps to increasing your chances of survival.  \n1. Face the dog, without staring at its head or eyes, backing up slowly. Never run. The dog is guaranteed to be faster than you.  \n2. Hold your mailbag in front of you. Empty? Full of Packages? No matter, it's better that the dog gets a bite of mail before a bite of mailman.  \n3. If things get hairy, use your ~~half-strength pepper spray~~ Dog Spray to deter the dog.\n\nNow, obviously, NOT ALL DOGS WILL ATTACK YOU. However, at first, we TREAT all dogs as if they will attack you. Once we get to know the dog, if we decide that it's \"friendly\", or we know with reasonable certainty that we can over-power the beast, then you can make your own calls. Angry chihuahua? Punt the bugger. No biggy.\n\n**EXPOSITION OVER - LET THE STORY BEGIN**\n\nSo I'm delivering mail. On a walking route. With my Supervisor in tow. She's helping me out, giving me pointers, and as we walk past this particular house, she says, \"These people have a problem dog, so we don't deliver.\" She makes notice that I don't have a card for that house, so she prints one up when we get back to the office.  \n\nNow, the house in question didn't have a dog outside the first time I passed by. Or the second time. Or the third time. In fact, I can't remember on what day the dog finally showed up. The matter of the fact is that I finally saw the dog, so I took my own preventative action.  \nI step out away from the house, walking a wide radius, to get to the next street box, but it's too late, the dog sees me. But this isn't a normal dog, it's a massive Pit Bull. And it starts barking and growling and in general just \"strutting its stuff,\" either being intimidating or getting ready for a fight, I'll never know. And it's following me.\n\nSide note, did you know that according to a [quick 5-second Google-Fu](http://petcomments.com/ten-dogs-which-have-the-strongest-bite/) that the Pit Bull has the strongest bite for its size category? Oh, and they're basically gentle-giants with built-in roid-rage when their family is threatened.\n\nSo anyways, I've put together these few things by this point.  \nThis is a pit bull.  \nI'm on his land.  \nI'm a stranger.  \nOn his land.  \nWalking very close to his land.  \nI probably look delicious.\n\nSo I assume my best anti-aggression stance, backing away slowly, looking at the ground, holding dog spray. And the dog actually goes back to its house. Success! So, to ensure my survival, I keep backing up a ways until the dog disappears from sight. So I back up some more before resuming mail-delivery-mode. I get the mail in one box, count it, ONE BOX, when I turn to double-check that this dog is gone, because by golly I DON'T WANNA GO BACK TO TRAINING FOR BEING UNSAFE. That was the most boring week of my life. UHG.  \n\nSo I do my double-check, quick spin to see what's behind me, and here comes this damned pit bull, not making a noise this time. Now, I'm not an expert on dogs, so I can't say what he was thinking. But I know what I'm thinking. \"This dog is trying to sneak a bite of my tushy!\"\n\nSo I immediately resume my Dog Bite Prevention Routine and start backing up with my dog spray again. But the dog keeps following. And finally, FINALLY, it goes away.\n\nFor distance perspective, this dog's house was the first on the block, and it followed me all the way to the last house of the same block. Like, what a dedicated canine, y'know? Just protecting his family. From the mailman. I mean, can't blame the dog, I don't like getting bills either, but whatevs.\n\nSo I go back to delivering mail. I go to the end of the street on this side, and I'm coming back down the other side. Here's a quick explanation: I've walked away from my mail van, there's a pit bull between me and my van. I **DO NOT** feel safe walking back to my van. I am on this block, dog is at the end of the next block, and my van is two blocks further. So I call my supervisor. She says she'll call the city, and I am to stay put in a safe place.\n\nLong story short, the Police roll up to me, I point out the dog that's on the next block, they say \"Yeah, that dog gets a lot of reports. We'll let that guy know. Thanks for the heads up! Stay safe!\"\n\nAnd then my supervisor rolls up in her car and rescues me. She drops me off at my van, and all is well.\n\nNext day, I'm delivering mail. And I get to the same house. Front door is closed, no dog in sight, all is well. So I walk past this particular house like a good little mailman, and I see, at the *next* house, a little pit-puppy. Well, crap. So I skip that house too. Don't wanna risk upsetting Mamma or Daddy, y'know? Rest of the day is business as usual.\n\nFast-Forward to today, the point from which I will be exacting my malicious compliance.\nI'm walking past this SAME HOUSE, but this time, the owner is on the porch. Not a big deal until he spots me, and then he goes into full-on insult mode, just laying it on thick.\n\n\"Oh damn, it's our pussy-ass mailman. Can't even deliver the mail because he's afraid of a little growling. He called the cops and nearly got our dog shot the other day because he was too afraid to deliver the mail.\"  \nEtc.\n\nAnd then he starts barking at me. Like, wtf, dude, are you depraved of attention? Do I need to come pet you!?\n\nSo anyways, I, the world's self-proclaimed nicest, most generous mailman, got incredibly peeved off by this one guy. So you know what? I'm just gonna do what I'm told.\n\nHe has a pit bull. Pit bulls protect their family. And this guy also has pit bull puppies.  \nWhen I am delivering mail, if I so much as see the man on his porch, I will turn back.  \nIf I so much as see the tip of a puppy's tail, I will turn back.  \nIf I so much as see the guy's front door open, I will turn back.  \n\nAnd my Office will back me up 100%, no doubt about it.  \nIf anyone complains, it'll be the folks at the end of the street, and we'll just have to explain that some ass-hat can't keep his dog contained.\n\nNow, I understand that this story was incredibly long, and that the payout is considerably low. Couple that with my latent inability to include tasty words with flavor and description, and you got yourself a pretty lousy Redditor.\n\nTLDR;  \nA man was being an absolute jerk about me not delivering to his house because he has a dog. Now I'm not delivering to his house if his front door is so much as ajar.",

        "text": "So a long time ago my papa was a brand new rookie member of law enforcement in a small town. There was a particular Captain known for being an angry guy. The type of guy who'd chuck a stapler at your head if he was angry. Let's call him Captain Hardass.\n\nSo at a shift meeting, Captain Hardass had an issue with the lack of tickets being written at a particular red light. A city council member had almost gotten into a traffic accident due to someone running a red. He commanded, \"You're gonna go down and sit on that intersection and you're gonna write tickets. I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE.\" \n\n\nSo after the meeting my papa was the first to head down to the light. He didn't want to get in trouble for not complying with The Captain orders. Within 5 minutes of watching the intersection  someone runs the light, and boy did they run it good. My papa pulls the driver over and what do you know, its the *Chief of Police's wife*. So being a good cop, my papa greets her by name and writes her a ticket. \n\nThe lady is LIVID. She asks what'll happen if she refuses to sign the ticket. His voice quivers as he says, \"Well Missus [Police Chief] I'm gonna have to arrest you...\"\nRealizing he was serious, she angrily snatches the ticket out of his hand and hastily signs it. \n\nThe next day my papa gets called into Captain Hardass's office. Other cops had been prepping my papa for this moment. But instead of yelling, the Captain wearily asks \"Don't you think you coulda seen fit to have given her a break?\" \nMy papa, sweating bullets, responds, \"I wanted to Captain, but you said- \"\nAnd Captain Hardass slumped down in his seat defeated. \n\nLater on, my Mama was working at a fundraiser with the Chief's Wife. The Chief's wife didn't realize my mama was the wife of Officer that wrote her ticket. So she complains to my mama about the ticket and the conversation she'd had with her husband after. \n\nIt went something like this: \n\nPolice Chief: Did you do it?\n\nWife: Yes\n\nPolice Chief: Well then quit complaining\n\nBecause the town was small, her ticket was reported in the local news paper. My papa never heard a word about if from the Chief. ",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster and am posting on mobile... Sorry for the longish post TLDR at bottom. \n\n\nSome Background\nI work as an auditor (at a call center) for a state. My department focuses on very specific audits, one of which is unreported income. So what is unreported income? Lottery winnings, monetary awards, regular wages and charged off debt. It’s money that is reported to the IRS as income (by employers or companies) but the taxpayer did not report as income. The IRS goes back to these tax returns and adjust the income to reflect everything that was reported for the taxpayer. \n\n\nIn my state (can’t speak for all states) , specific things have to match the Federal return exactly: income, filing status, exemptions, etc. So once the IRS makes a change to a taxpayer’s income we automatically have to adjust the state return as well. 10 out of 10 times this creates a bill. \n\n\nThe Story \nI’m taking calls one day and I have the bad luck of answering a call from angry taxpayer (ATP for short). He had been aware he had an open audit with the state but since he already fixed it with the IRS, he assumed we would be made aware and fix it. Sounds reasonable, except that’s not how it works. They have to send us a transcript or notify us so that we can look it up ourselves. I’m really amazing with customer service and can usually deescalate a situation but this dude was screaming the whole time and kept cutting me off. Nothing I did calmed him down. I stayed calm and tried to be helpful but he would not let up. I’m not great at recalling dialogue but the last little snippet of this 10 minute call went something like this: \n\n\nATP: I already fixed it with the IRS I don’t know why the hell I still owe you money. You need to fix this. \n\n\nMe: Sir, unfortunately it’s your responsibility to notify us. I can try-\n\n\nATP: No, it’s not my responsibility. You started this now you need to end it too. \n\n\nMe: Sir it doesn’t quite work that way. We have to follow what the IRS does on these types of audits. If you have already fixed it we just need a copy of the transcript to verify the change and we can reverse it. Do you by any chance have a copy of the transcript? If not I can request a copy. \n\n\nATP: Finally, do your damn job. I want this done with. Get it right this time. I’m sick of dealing with you people. \n\n\nAnd he hangs up. \n\n\nI’m usually super helpful and will bend over backwards to help people. Doesn’t matter if you are mean or nice, I try to help people as best I can. Well I obtain a copy of the transcript and guess what I find? Dude never fixed anything with the IRS. Upon further inspection, I see that whoever imputed his data actually made an error. He had a deduction that the IRS disallowed that we were supposed to disallow as well but somehow got overlooked. I would usually turn a blind eye and in my own way of trying to help out us little guys.\n\n\nI didn’t know I had it in me but in that moment I remembered him saying “Get it right this time.” Well sir, it appears we are taking request today. I went ahead and adjusted his tax return to what it was supposed to be and ATP ended up with a higher tax bill. \n\n\nI haven’t heard back from him but I sure did feel a sense of satisfaction afterwards. \n\n\nTLDR\nI’m an auditor. Had a taxpayer call being rude, screaming and talking down to me. His audit requires him dealing with us and the IRS, of which he refused to deal with us. He asked that we fix his return and do it right, so I did. I made sure an error on his taxes that was previously overlooked got fixed which cost him more money in the end.\n\n\nEdits: TLDR. Thanks for all the help! Get rid of the word So at the start of sentences \n\n",

        "text": "In 1977-78, the NHL passed a new rule stating that players had to have their names appear on their jerseys along with their numbers. Leaf owner, Harold Ballard refused, claiming no one would then buy his programs. The league threatened heavy fines, so Ballard gave in. For Toronto’s next game in Chicago on February 26, 1978, the names appeared on the Leaf’s blue jerseys….in blue, making them unreadable. The next day the league changed the wording of the rule, to stipulate the names must be in a colour opposite to the colour of the jersey. The Leafs then began using a contrasting colour as the rest of the league.\n\nhttps://thehockeywriters.com/a-brief-history-of-nhl-uniforms/",

It's for the navy so authority figures (chiefs) don't always talk to their subordinates in a way that would be acceptable in a normal business environment, also when we are out to sea (underway) we have to share two beds with three people, we rotate it is called hot-racking so our sleep is very precious to us.\n\nWe were underway a while ago and my chief emailed me about some tasking he had for me. Keep in mind i am a pretty good sailor i have always been one the top performers of the boat and am in the top 3 of evals everytime. Well he emailed me with a task, so i performed said task and when i saw him eating on crews mess the next morning i informed him that i had completed the tasking. Even though the deadline was still several days away. \n\nInstead of saying good job or even just a simple \"ok\" or \"aye\" he proceeded to chew me out in front of half my watch section for not responding to his email. And said that i WILL respond to every email he sends me. And while i am a hard worker one of my flaws is i usually do not hold my tongue when i should but this morning i was in a good mood bc we were visiting a port in florida in a day or two so i painfully just took the ass chewing and carried on with my business.\n\nBefore i went to bed (the rack) i set up a rule in outlook to auto respond to any emails i received from my chief saying something along the lines of \"Aye Chief, I understand that you have emailed me and i am now responding to said email. Very Respectfully, ET3 (SS)\" \n\nAs i was snuggled up in my rack sleeping like a log i am awakened by a member of my division saying \"hey man ET1 (my leading petty officer the guy directly under my chief) wants you in Crews Mess.\" So reluctantly i get out of the rack and report to crews mess as ordered where my LPO is waiting with a write up and laughing hysterically. \n\nI check my email to see an email from chief with tasking, another email from my chief talling me to stop being a \"fucking smart ass and watch who the f i am talking to\" and then another email asking if it is an auto reply (with more foul language) and then another email just going ballistic on me and one last email simply telling me i will be counseled for this.\n\nNeedless to say my cheif never screamed at me about emails again, ans he was actually removed from my boat for basically being a terrible chief about 4 months after this and my write up was eventually shredded by my LPO who thought the whole situation was hilarious.\n\nI apologize for spelling as i am using my phone. Just thought you guys might enjoy this.\n\n",

In these periods you are meant to be doing homework etc in absolute quiet and a teacher supervised you in a dedicated study hall.\n\nI was 18 at the time and suffering regular migraines. Fortunately  (if you ever can be fortunate with with migraines) I would get ample warning of the impending doom with a visual aura in one of my eyes. It looks like a kaleidoscope. \n\nAnyway, I happened to have 2 study classes back to back when this happened and so at the very start of class, I told the supervising teacher what the craic was. He was sympathic and told me to put my head down and try to close my eyes.\n\nThat hour the pain train came and I sat with eyes squeezed shut, letting the nausea roll over me. Bell rang and chill teacher was replaced by another who was not chill at all. She had the rapid speech and short temper of a caffeine deprived squirrel and she was NOT happy to see me with my head down. She jabbed my shoulder and got right into my face, scolding me for setting a bad example to the first year students who happened to now be in the study hall due to a cancelled class. By this stage, my pupils were tiny (aversion of bright lights) and I was pale as heck so it was clear I wasn't 100% but calmly I explained that I was having a migraine and that chill teacher said it was cool to put my head down.\n\nThis excuse wasn't going to fly with her and she told me I had to stand up and explain to the entire study hall why I was sleeping and why I should have been doing some work. \n\nI stood up, shakily, cleared my throat and with my eyes closed (bright light aversion FTW) everyone what a migraine was, how it felt and how if I tried to look at words, it would make me vomit. Teacher was ripping but thankfully the headmaster saw the logic of my response and called my mum to pick me up. \n\nTLDR - have migraine in school, get told to put head down by one teacher, other teacher thinks I'm being lazy and makes me tell other kids why migraines suck.",

        "text": "When I was younger I worked for a video rental chain where employees had to wear khaki pants and blue shirts sporting the company logo. I was an assistant manager and we hired a middle\\-aged woman as a customer service representative. She had worked for a big telecom company and had been laid off after it had an accounting scandal and filed bankruptcy. I trained her, we got along really well and she did good work.  \n\nEventually another store about 15 miles away was having big problems and they fired most of the management in that store and I transferred to that store to help turn the store around getting it back into compliance and profitability.  I was picked because at 23 years old I was one of the most respected and hardest workers in our district of 16 stores. \n\nDuring my almost full year repairing the failing store the woman we hired in the first store had been promoted all the way up to store manager soon after I left. There were several assistant managers that were a bit surprised that they promoted a customer service rep straight to store manager, but whatever, she had a previous professional background and played the politics right. \n\nI learned from my friends and former colleagues in the first store that she had become a managerial tyrant, bossing everyone around with an quick temper and bitter anger. I couldn't believe it because the lady I knew and trained was pretty nice, so when they asked me to transfer back to that store and work for her I agreed because I get along with almost everyone.  \n\nIt all started fine, but then she started taking responsibilities away from me because I was doing them to company standards and not the way she wanted them done. All of the employees in the store would come to me with problems because they were all scared of her. Her moody temperament started to bother even me, Mr. Nice Guy.  \n\nI came in one day and had my shirt tucked in and wasn't wearing a belt, sometimes I didn't wear one or just forgot to bring one. She was in an ugly mood that day and told me to go home and get a belt stating that it was in the employee handbook that I had to wear a belt. I lived three towns or 14 miles from the store and told her I didn't think that the handbook said that. She got more mad and started yelling at me in front of customers and so I told her I'd go to the back room and check the handbook. Flipping through the book to dressing and grooming I found that it said if males were wearing khaki pants *that had belt loops* they had to wear a belt. Hmmm, okay...grabbed some scissors and very neatly removed the belt loops and all of the associated stitching. \n\nI went back out to the floor and started working. Fifteen minutes later she saw me and asked/yelled why I was still there not wearing a belt. I took out the handbook I'd been carrying around and told showed her the part about the belt loops and that I found a solution to be in compliance. I've never seen anyone turn as red or get as angry as she was. She began yelling, screaming, hooting and hollering in front of a number of customers and three employees. She told me to go to the back room and wait there.   \n\nAbout 10\\-15 minutes later the phone buzzed and the district leader was on the phone for me. Stupid crazy bitch lady had called from the phone behind the counter in front of the store and customer screaming that I should be fired. So the DL asked me what was going on \\(she is the one that picked me to help fix other store\\) and so I told her the story on how I had cut my belt loops off. She was quiet for a moment and then said \"that's really funny.\" We then talked for well over an hour about the performance of the stupid crazy bitch lady and employee morale in the store and generally how things were going. \n\nThe next day the district leader and regional manager both happened to surprise visit our store and had a nice long meeting with stupid crazy bitch lady. I ended up transferring to another under performing store soon thereafter and she was put on probation and was then fired about a month later.  \n\nTL;DR: Nice customer service rep lady was promoted to store manager then became psycho and told me to put on a belt. Handbook said if wearing pants with belt loops you needed to wear a belt, so I cut off belt loops. Lady went full on psycho on me and tried to get me fired but my district leader loved me and crazy lady got put on probation and then fired instead.  \n\nEdit: one word in TL;DR. ",

I can use a single prepaid card on both that I can top up anytime when my credit is running low. On this particular day I did not have enough credits to take the train so I have to go to a counter and pay to reload. On the counter it says \"Exact Change Only\" but I normally have no problems when purchasing credits in larger amounts. This time the nice lady that was always there was replaced by a middle-aged gentleman with a disgruntled employee look. I head to the counter and I pay P500 ($10) bill to top up P300 ($6) so he just needed to give me P200 as change. But instead he refuses to take my payment and points to the sign that says \"Exact Change Only.\" I tried to reason that I'm buying credits he can process quickly but he won't have it and just pointed to the next window with about 4-5 people on queue. No one else was queued up on this window so I decided to try some malicious compliance. I took the P500 bill back and dug into my bag for a bunch of P1, P5, and P10 coins, put them on the tray, and said \"P100 please.\" He pauses for a bit, sighs, and spends a couple of minutes to count the coins which only totaled up to P72 so I said \"Oh, my bad. P72 please.\" So he tops up my card and I could feel his anger the way he tossed it back towards me. ",

        "text": "Not sure if this totally fits here, but I'm going to post it anyway.\n\nA few years ago, I worked retail at a store where people would STOP by to purchase video games. After about 2 years, our district manager decided that in order to properly open a store, the opening employee needed to arrive 2 hours before the store opened. He was such a stickler for this he fired a good friend of mine for violating his policy. Granted my friend would show up 15 minuted before the store was supposed to open and would frequently skip a lot of the required opening duties. It was actually my friend getting fired that got me transferred to this particular store.\n\nNow the location was in a mall, and store itself was about twice the size of your standard broom closet. This meant that including a 15 minute trip to the bank to deposit the cash from the previous day, it never took more than an hour to get the store ready to be open. This meant that if I showed up at 9 am, I could easily have the store ready to open at 10 am, when the mall opened. Also, showing up at an hour before the store opened gave me an extra hour to help out who ever was closing the store that evening with normal duties, like processing shipments, organizing merchandise, being rude to jerk customers, etc.\n\nAfter about a week or 2 of this, I get a very angry call from the District Manager. He had apparently wanted something at 8:15 one morning and called the store. Because no one answered he decided that no one was showing up to open the store properly, and that must mean that the store was a complete mess. I explained to him that the store was small enough that it didn't require 2 hours to get ready to open, even if there was still things needed to be done from the night before (which while not frequent, was common enough that I was used to it). I also explained that because of how corporate works the scheduling, me showing up an hour earlier meant I had to leave an hour earlier, which would increase the work load for anyone who was closing. He didn't want to hear it, as this was his policy and I was the only one not following it in his whole district, and that if I didn't follow his orders then I could look for a new job.\n\nWell, not wanting to lose my sweet gig of selling video games to the colorful customers of this particular games store, I complied. So from then on I would show up at 8 am sharp every morning I was opening the store. I would get everything I needed done around the store by 8:30 and be back from the bank by 8:45. I would then sit on the counter and wait for 10 am. Then I would leave an hour earlier than usual, so I had more time to do other things (I was going to college full-time, so having an extra hour was actually a blessing). This, however, meant whoever was closing the store was on their own for an hour before the rest of the closing staff would show up.\n\nThe true malicious compliance, however, came the day I was opening and the store manager had to call out sick. In order to save on possible overtime (which the company was completely against for any reason), the District Manager agreed to cover her closing shift. This day just happened to be a day where it was particularly slow in the morning, so I had the store looking perfect when he showed up for the closing shift. To make things even better, the shipment for that day was late, and so it showed up shortly before I was to clock out. On top of that, the traffic into the store picked up as I was having to leave. This meant that I left the District Manager with a large shipment needing to be processed, a store full of snot-nosed kids and angry soccer moms, and no one to help him deal with this for at least another hour. Needless to say the look of angry frustration on his face as I clocked out is one of my most cherished memories from my time at that store.",

I didn't like this gig for various reasons, but almost everyone was way to stressed all the time about everything.  With the heightened stress on a daily basis, imagine it when the regional director came for a plant visit.  There were weeks of prep for the entire engineering team prior to his visit.  People cancelled their vacations or cut short their vacations in order to prepare for this plant visit.  As an intern, we contributed, but not that much because we were interns.  Finally, it came to the day before the visit.  The fellow interns and I met with our mentor for final meeting prior to the director's visit.  He said \"Hey, I need you guys to come in at 6:30am tomorrow instead of the usual 8am.\"  We asked why since all the other engineers were busy getting ready.  He said \"Eh, just in case we need you for something.\"  I'm rolling my eyes internally but sure, he's the boss so we all showed up at 6:30am the next day.  \n\nWe start doing our normal daily stuff and the mentor is quite frantic from the stress of the director's plant visit.  At around 6:45, we ask him if he needed us to do anything and he said \"Eh, I don't really have anything.  Oh, I know.  Go out on the plant floor and make sure nothing is out of place.\"  This place believed in the 5S methodology.  So, starting at about 7am, I did as I was told and went to check the plant floor for anything that was out of place.  I walked down the 1st row of machines and made sure that everything on the floor was in its proper spot according to 5S.  Then, I went to the next row and check everything that I saw.  Then the next and the next and the next.... Finally about 15 minutes before lunchtime, at around 11:15, I finished the last row and went back to the office.  The other interns asked me where I have been.  I told them I did what our boss told us to do: go check the floor to see if anything was out of place.  And then I told them my process for what I did for those 4.5 hours.  And they laughed.  They got done with their bits early and were just sitting around because our stressed out boss was so busy and stressed from the director's plant visit that he didn't have time to give us more stuff to do.  I also told them that I put about 5 things back in their places over the course of those 4.5 hours and I found a floor worker sleeping on the toilet in the bathroom.\n\nI know it isn't a quality one, but that's my 1st MC story.",

        "text": "Hey MC, finally got one for you.  It's a long one.\nTL:DR at bottom\n\nA few years ago I worked in manufacturing for a small architectural firm specializing in ACM fascia cladding. ACM, for those who don't know, stands for Aluminum Composite Material and is pretty much a wafer of polyethylene plastic laminated on either side by a thin layer of aluminum. Its sturdy, decorative, and easy to work with... but also extremely heavy. They come in long sheets, usually 16'x5', and arrive on long pallets or \"skids\" After the sheets are processed into the needed shapes they are stacked flat on top of each other on the same skids that they came in on and then stacked and strapped down to flat bed trailers to be shipped out.  \n\nWell, some 8 months or so into my stay there, they hired someone new to work on panel design and cut sheets. He was hired to replace the previous person after they outright quit because of some unrelated poor choices by upper management. We'll call him TryHard (TH). Regardless, instead of promoting from within they hired this guy. He was nice... at first. Obvious low self-esteem, yet very arrogant. He was the typical \"ideas\" guy you'd find at a lot of places. Now this wouldn't be an issue normally, except his ideas sucked and he wasn't even very good at his own job. The amount of recuts we had to do because of his ineptitude cost easily thousands of dollars a quarter. Those sheets aren't cheap. But he'd routinely come out to the shop for a smoke break and wander towards either the welders or the CNC router where I was and he'd give... tips. He had zero experience in CNC machining or welding or manufacturing at all, mind you, so his ideas were bad for any number of reasons and we kept telling him the things he was bringing up have already been tried, and there is a reason we do things the way we do.  \n\nAfter being shot down or making it obvious I want him away from my router he usually puts out his cigarette on the shop floor and shuffles back inside to go screw up more cut sheets.  \nOne day though, he came out with a *brilliant* (terrible) idea for a totally redesigned way to ship the panels after they're cut.  \n\n&gt; TH: Instead of shipping them laying flat, we should ship them standing upright!  \n\nNow I see the logic in this, if they're upright then its easier for the field crew to pull panels off and organize them how they want them. It is tedious and difficult to sift through the skids how they are. He had a design and everything, it could work... However there were a plethora of reasons why this hadn't ever been done in the past, and I laid them out for him as nicely as possible. His design effectively amounted to a regular 16' skid... with a 5' wall down the middle running the whole length made from 2x4s.  \n\n&gt; Me: Okay, its a solid design but here's where it gets tricky. What you're asking is for us to custom build a wall onto an existing skid. We get these skids for free from the manufacturer, but adding lumber gets expensive really fast. Furthermore, there aren't any supports for that wall. If we stack 500lbs of panels against that wall it's going to snap at the base. Even if it doesn't snap the wall off, those panels will flex against the open air under them. We can add a sloped wall, but then its even more expensive and harder to build.  \nOn top of that, this design makes it difficult to ship. We can't stack anything on top, we can't put as much under it, and the wide profile on the front will increase drag and cause the panels to oscillate in the wind, which could damage them further. We can add a wind shield to protect the panels, but that again increases the cost and complexity.\n\nNow, assuming we did all this anyway and worked out the issues with shipping it, I have no doubt that it would indeed make life easier for the guys in the field. One final issue though, they never bring the skids back. They throw them away on site. *We would have to build this custom skid every single time for each shipment*  \n\nWe went back and forth for about 15 minutes, with me holding firm that myself and my partner on the router were not about to stop doing our jobs for 3 hours while we prototyped a shitty skid design and waste hundreds of dollars in wood and man hours for some harebrained idea. Getting increasingly flustered eventually he gave up and yelled something about how all we do is shit on his ideas and he just wants to help.  \n\nTime passes, and he returns to the shop... with our boss in tow. Boss asks if we can just give it a shot.  \nOkay fine. So my partner pulls me to the side and pretty much tells me he's going to half-ass it because he doesn't want to waste this much time on it. Fair enough, but I give a counter idea. If we want TH to stop doing this, we need to embarrass him. If we half as it, then he'll blame us the moment it fails. So, lets do this: Put 120% into it. Give suggestions to improve it. Pick the best skid we have and put a couple of extra screws into every joint. Make it the best executed terrible design we possibly can.  \n\nSo we got to work. Picked the sturdiest skid we had, and we made it beautiful. It took hours, $500 worth of lumber, nails, \"liquid nails\" (industrial wood glue), and ~7 total man hours, so over $650 when done. I'll admit it was impressive when it was finished. We stacked the panels on it, banded it best we could, and it took an additional hour to load the skid-wall onto the truck because the forklift driver couldn't see past the skid-wall where usually he can just see over it since they're usually only 16\" tall. I made sure to give plenty of help loading it, and we eventually succeeded in strapping it down. And off it went onto its 16 hours truck ride to wherever.  \n\nWell, truck was late to the site because the driver kept stopping to figure out the odd noise. Several of the smaller panels had slid out and fallen off the truck because we couldn't band it as reliably since everything was sitting upright at a 60 degree angle. It was indeed easier for the field crew to work with once it was at the site, but some of the panel edges had been damaged from resting on the edge of it for 16 hours. At the end, as I knew they would, the crew destroyed the skid and threw it away, because it would cost way more to ship it back to the shop. When boss relayed that report to us I saw TH wandering out towards us and I made eye contact and loudly asked when he was in earshot.  \n&gt; Me: So, $650 for a disposable skid, was it worth it?  \nBoss: Not in the slightest. We are never building that again.\n\nAnd I just stared at TH and nodded my head.\n&gt; Me: Roger that, never again.  \n\nTH veered off quick and smoked somewhere else. Waiting until Boss went inside before finishing. He made a point to avoid going to the router when I was there after that.\n\nTL:DR  \nLocal \"IdeasGuy\" has terrible idea, complains to boss when we won't try his worst idea yet, Boss orders us to try it, I bust ass to make sure its my best work yet to ensure that when it fails its purely because his idea was bad.",

        "text": "So a few years ago my wife and I had to move to a seedy little apartment in a bad part of town because we were poor. The neighbors were... interesting. Lots of drugs, lots of parties. Which wasn't too awful I guess, but they also were violent. There were fights every night. A week after we moved in, some tenants went to jail because they stabbed a few people, I guess?\n\nNow normally my wife and I just kept our heads down and minded our own business, but it turns out the next door neighbor really, really didn't like us. He'd move his car into our parking spot when we left for the day, liked to stand on our stoop and block our way to our own door, and occasionally pounded on the paper-thin walls between our apartments and shouted things like \"Yeah I'm loud, what the fuck are you going to do about it?! What the fuck are you going to do about it?!\"\n\nLiving with such an intrusive and unstable neighbor was NOT fun, especially considering my wife was pregnant and we didn't really feel safe. The landlord was not helpful in the slightest, so we began actively looking for a new place, planning on breaking our lease if we had to. \n\nOne day the crazy neighbor was hanging out just outside our door with a bunch of shady looking people. I tried to politely make my way through to get to my door but they butted me aside. \"My crew will FUCK you up, faggot! We will FUCK you UP!\" Says crazy neighbor. I get pissed and tell him, in so many words, that he wouldn't be so intrusive and threatening if he knew who I hung out with. \"Yeah, you call up your friends! You call them right up! My crew will FUCK them up!\" he shouts at me. I eventually make it into my apartment, where I stew in anger about the whole situation.\n\nNow, normally I would just ignore this guy, but he was clearly escalating his behavior. And I, being a gentleman, decided to take him up on his offer of having some friends over for a friendly time of joy and fellowship.\n\nDid I mention that my dad, my uncle, and two of my cousins were patrol officers with the sheriff's department? I hadn't talked to them about my neighbor situation, because I didn't want my tires to get slashed, but I figured now was as good a time as any to let the crazy apartment complex know that maybe, just maybe, they should find someone else to mess with. I called my dad up and explained my neighbor's behavior, and said I wasn't interested in any kind of formal police stuff just yet, but wouldn't you know, he wants all my friends to come over! We could have a grand old time. My dad laughed and said he would see what he could arrange.\n\nI should note here that me and crazy neighbor had our own side entrances on the right side of the building, while everyone else had units inside the actual building. So if I were to, say, have some friends over in the parking lot, we would be right outside crazy neighbor's door.\n\nWell, four or five days later, I had my friends over! About a dozen uniformed police officers, mostly sheriff deputies but a couple of state troopers as well. We had a big barbecue right in the parking lot, eating steaks and having a grand old time. We had a few laughs at my neighbor's expense, as he kept pulling his curtain aside and peeking out his window, but was clearly not interested in coming out. I got the courage to knock on crazy neighbor's door after a couple of beers and said \"Hey, my friends are over! Didn't you want to fuck up my friends? You and your crew? Here they are!\" Mysteriously, he did not come to his door.\n\nThere were usually tenants out walking around or visiting each other throughout the day, but not this day. Dead silence around the whole apartment complex.\n\nThe next day, my fears of revealing my friendly ties to the local police were realized, as I went out to go to work and found that my car's tires had been slashed to pieces. This time, I did the proper thing and made a police report, which my uncle personally responded to, going to crazy neighbor's door and asking if he \"saw anything.\" \n\nTwo weeks later, my wife and I moved into my parent's basement, as my dad had decided that he did not want me living in that complex. I don't think I ever told him where exactly I lived before the barbecue, and he was probably freaked out to realize that it was a shady place with a high call volume. My wife and I were able to find a much nicer place of our own before my son was born :)\n\nI saw crazy neighbor's mugshot in the paper a couple of months later. Turns out he had been trying to cook meth on his stove and started a little fire.",

        "text": "Back when I used to work in the service industry I had an Assistant manager (ass.) who after the Christmas services had to move all the furniture back into the restaurant from all the different dining locations in the hotel.\n\nAs we’re bringing all the tables back in he tells me he wants the restaurant to have a different look. So we need to bring in one table at the time, and he’ll decide where it should go. By this time I’ve been on my feet for a good 14 hours so not really in the mood for this BS. I ask Ass if he’s cleared this idea with the General Manager (GM). Of course the answer is: ‘no, but he won’t mind.’ \n\nAt this point I have this nagging suspicion in the back of my head that it’s going to bite me in the butt. I tell Ass I don’t think we should do it, once he has cleared it with GM we can do it later in the week. The answer remains ‘Do as I say.’ To which I simply reply ‘As you wish, but if GM tell you to return everything to the original state of being, you’re fixing it, we’re not lifting a .’ Ass agrees, we do as we’re told. Once we’re done it’s 2am and I’m done after 17hrs. \n\nFast forward 8hrs. GM walk into the restaurant: ‘What the fuck, who did this?’ I point him to Ass. Ass has his ass chewed and informs us to put everything as it was. I remind him of our discussion the night before and tell him to get busy. GM sees us doing nothing and asks what’s going on. So I explain the situation, get a cuddo and GM is on his way. \n\nThe ass had to leave is within a month, GM left a year later, me another while after that. I went back last week, nothing has changed.\n\nTl;dr Ass wants change, GM doesn’t I get caught in the middle.\n\nEdit: different-finger ",

The flats were basically 5 strangers lumped together, with there own rooms and shared kitchen and bathroom. Unsurprisingly, there were a few personality clashes. \n\nThe flat had 5 girls in, four were friends and went out clubbing, drinking and so on. My friend had a quieter approach to enjoying herself and soon the flat had a split of her against them. I know my friend and she is generally agreeable unless other people are pissing her off. The girls were, for lack of a better word, bullying my friend because differences etc etc.\n\nAfter months of living with these girls, my friend had a shower in the shared bathroom, then in her towel proceeded to the kitchen (also shared) to make some coffee. In come the four flatmates to make some food or otherwise use the kitchen. \n\nThey took issue with my friend because apparently wearing a towel is not okay in shared spaces. Even for the few minutes it takes to make coffee. I'm not sure if they wanted people to change into their clothing in the bathroom or if darting from the bathroom to the person's bedroom was permissable but ultimately that isn't important. \n\nThey told her she couldn't wear a towel in the kitchen. My friend turned, looked at them and replied, \"okay then\". She removed the towel to lots of shouting, finished making her coffee then walked back to her room.\n\nThey complained but my friend didn't get in trouble with the building staff because it was put down to miscommunication.",

        "text": "So I've posted this story before but realized it could fall under the \"malicious compliance\" category so I figured I’d post it here too. Just for a little background, when I was in high school, my buddies and I would go over my friend's (Timmy's) house to chill all night. His parents went to bed early each night and his father (Joe Dirt) was adamant about not being disturbed. He was a hardass and didn't care about making a shout-filled scene and all that.  There was only one bathroom in the house which was connected to his parent’s bedroom. One night, one of us risked it and went up to take a piss. Well, Joe Dirt woke up and let him have it. He told Timmy, and I remember this very clearly that, “I don’t give a fuck how bad you have the piss and shit! Figure out a different way or don’t have you friends come over at all!” So, for the next few years all of us used to piss in water bottles in fear of waking up Joe Dirt. What happened to those bottles we assumed Timmy got rid off...\n\nOne day over the summer, I went over Timmy’s house to help him clean and move his shit from the basement up to the third floor.  His grandmother was moving to a condo and Timmy was taking her place.  I get there and as usual, smoked a joint, ripped a ton of boges, and began cleaning up.\n\nTimmy’s dad came down to see what us assholes were up to.  Like I said before, Joe Dirt is the type of guy you don’t wanna mess with.  He may not be the biggest guy, but his strict personality and tough upbringing made up for it.  It’s important to note that Timmy and Dirt have the kind of relationship where they constantly break each others balls, especially while at work.  Joe Dirt owns a business and he and Timmy always go at it… even when there are customers shopping around.\n\nFor example:\n\n“Hey Penis, stop sittin’ while you piss and help this guy find ‘X’ product!” Joe Dirt said to Timmy while he was in the bathroom.\n\n“You better watch it old man or I’ll throw these shit rags at you!”\n\n“Timmy, if it was raining pussy, you’d still get hit in the head with a dick.”\n\nStuff like that.\n\nAnyway, Joe Dirt came down, called Timmy a “Penis” like he always does and offered to lend a hand.  Within five minutes he began complaining.\n\n“This place is a goddamn mess!  What the fuck did you do down here!  This place is a shithole!”\n“Is this how you treat someone who pays the BILLS?!  Your mother should have spat you on the wall!”  \n\nHe then looked under Timmy’s bed to find a bunch of condom wrappers with the used rubbers stuffed back in them.\n\n“Jesus H. Christ!  There’s a bunch of loaded jimmies under here!  You’re lucky I’m not knocking you out right now!  Who the hell would wanna fuck you!?  I bet they were all dudes, you queer!” he yelled.\n\nObviously, Timmy and I were trying our hardest to contain our laughter so he wouldn’t get any angrier.  Joe Dirt then headed over to the closet, opened it up, and began ripping stuff out.  We walked over to see what kind of shit he was uncovering.  After a few shoes and articles of clothing flew past our heads, Joe Dirt got his hands on this HUGE duffle bag and heaved it out of the closet.  He unzipped it and began inspecting the contents inside.  He reached in and pulled out a water bottle full of musky, damp and amber colored liquid with a bunch of sediment resting at the bottom.  He appeared confused and reached in again to pull the same thing out, and then again, and again and again…\n\nI turned to look at Timmy, who was covering his face with his hands.  He then started pulling out 2-liter bottles filled to the brim with same yellow liquid.  After a couple of those, he reached down further into the bag and lifted out a huge glass mason jar with the same substance inside.  He put the jar on top of a dresser, analyzed it, then looked at the entire collection of bottles.  I looked back at Timmy who was beat red, then back at Dirt.\n\n“Tim...is this...is…IS THIS A BAG OF PISS!” Joe Dirt yelled as he shoved the bag into Timmy’s chest.\n\n“Ummm…..yea.”\n\nThe expression on Joe Dirt's face was a mixture of angry, sad, and confused.  I’m not sure if he wanted to laugh or cry.  I however, started to laugh like I’ve never laughed before.\n\n“What’s so funny?  How would you like it if I went over your house and hid piss in your closet?!” he said to me.\n\nI was too choked up to muster any sort of response.\n\n“I’m so disappointed in you!  What the fuck!  Where’d all this piss come from!?” Joe Dirt asked Timmy.\n\n“Ummmm probably from the last five years,” Tim said quietly.\n“Are you some sort of retard?!  What?  Are you embarrassed to use the goddamn toilet?! Are your dicks so little you piss on your balls?  No wonder there’s so much piss on the toilet seat every time I go in there!!!”\n\n“When I had friends over at night, they were too scared to wake you up by going to the bathroom so we pissed in bottles,” replied Tim.\n“What did you assholes do when you had to shit?!  Did you squat out the windows and drop loads all over my patio?  Did you pinch your loafs in trash bags and throw them in the woods?  Fucking kids!  You’re all young, dumb, and full of cum!”\n\nI was hysterical.  I couldn’t breathe.  The idea of Timmy stockpiling 5 years worth of our piss in his closet only for his Dad to find was too much for me to handle.\n\n“What else am I gonna find in that closet!  A bunch of crusty socks stuck to the floor!?  A bunch of rats fucking?!  I can hear them right now!”\n\nThat was it, I had to get fresh air.  I literally could not breathe from laughing so much.  I jogged towards the stairs and in doing so, bumped into the dresser causing the mason jar filled with the aged bladder juice to fall and shatter all over Joe Dirt’s shoes.  He wailed like a banshee as he jumped back in complete horror.  The smell was so vile and rancid that he immediately covered his mouth and ran upstairs without even realizing he was tracking his pissy shoes all over the place.  I fell to the ground with tears streaming down my face.  Timmy grabbed a mop and rapidly cleaned the foul bodily fluid as fast as he could.  It took me a good 20 minutes and a couple cigarettes to compose myself.  \n\nIn the end, we cleaned up and moved everything nicely.  It took a few weeks for the smell of rotten piss to go away and for Joe Dirt to forgive me for ruining his Nike’s and some of his carpet.  But, he was a lot more lenient when Timmy had us over and made sure he wouldn’t get too upset at us going to the bathroom like civilized adults.  However, “Is this a bag of piss?” has become one of our favorite catchphrases of all time. \n\n\n",

        "text": "This took place about two years ago when I was driving a delivery truck for a big box store. This is a long one, sorry folks, but I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nEvery morning after loading the truck with the days deliveries the driver would fill out an inspection sheet insuring that they had looked over the truck and that everything was functioning as it should. Pretty standard procedure and any *good* company pays attention to these logs. Tuesday as I was making local deliveries I noticed that the transmission in the truck was acting up, it was having a hard time changing gears and would occasionally lurch. I made sure to call my manager to let her know what was going on (and was instructed to just keep making my deliveries), I noted the problem on the daily inspection sheet and then when I got back to the store I went ahead and sent an email explaining the problem to my manager and her boss to cover my ass. \n\nFriday morning after a nice two days off I was assigned the same truck and when it came time to do my morning inspection I realized that no one had driven it while I was gone, and therefore the truck had not been taken to a shop or seen by a mechanic. I was also only two hours away from hitting over time and my manager decided that instead of being stuck making local deliveries for 10 hours instead I would take one large delivery two hours from the store and end my work week with only two-and-a-halfish hours of overtime.  \n\nBefore I left I made sure to remind my manager that the truck had been acting up and she again told me to just keep making my deliveries and to call her if there was a problem. Well guess what happened? An hour and a half after leaving the store while driving through rural Arkansas the transmission on the truck crapped out but I was able to coast into the parking lot of a long abandoned gas station (which was especially nice since the road didn't have a shoulder). My manager was *not* pleased when I told her that the truck was now undriveable and that I hadn't even made my one delivery yet. She instructed me to let the customer know we would have to reschedule their delivery while she arranged for a tow truck. Well guess what happened next? *The customer absolutely refused to reschedule their delivery*. On my truck were three pallets of hardwood flooring and the customer already had a crew on site waiting for the flooring to arrive so it could be installed. They were *furious* and insisted that no matter what the flooring had to be delivered *today*. \n\nThe customer had ordered about $8,000 worth of product so when they called the store upset management guaranteed that the delivery would be made that day as promised. So guess what I got to do? I was paid to sit in the truck and wait for the other delivery drivers to finish their local deliveries for the day *then* drive out to where my truck was stranded, transfer the flooring to their truck and complete the delivery. \n\n*IT TOOK NINE HOURS FOR THE OTHER TRUCK TO ARRIVE* \n\nThe guy who was in the truck with me was *livid*, and likely would have quit there on the spot if he wasn't stranded with me. Each truck is required to be manned by two people and luckily me and the guy got along pretty good but he was cussing up a storm by the time the other truck arrived. Once the other truck did arrive  it took us nearly an hour to swap the pallets from our truck to the next using pallet jacks on uneven surfaces. Finally we got that done and were able to make the delivery and all go home when we realized that there *four* of us altogether but only *three* seats in the truck that came to get us. \n\n*SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT WHILE ANOTHER COWORKER DROVE THE HOUR AND A HALF TO COME GET THEM* \n\nMy co-driver was determined to get out of there that instant and neither of the guys who came to get us wanted to stay either so I happily volunteered to. My manager had already left for the evening but the closing manager was able to get a cashier who I was friends with to agree to pick me up in their personal vehicle (they did so on the clock and got reimbursed for the mileage) once their shift was over at 8pm. \n\nIt was nearly 10pm before my ride finally arrived (I had him stop and pick me up McDonald's on the way since I had run out of water and chips hours before) and midnight when we finally got back to the store. Everyone else had left hours before but the closing manager had to remain until we came back so he could lock the store up after we clocked out and went home for the night. \n\nI clocked out that night having put in an 18 shift *16 hours of which was over time.* \n\nWhen I came in at 6am the following morning instead of being assigned a truck for the day I had to have a meeting with HR, my manager, her manager and the store manager to explain just what the fuck had happened. Luckily my emails and truck inspection slips were enough to cover my ass and instead of getting fired HR let me go home to catch up on sleep while my manager got *her* ass chewed out instead. \n\nWe had a nice new rental truck waiting for me Sunday when I came back while my usual truck was in the shop. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR \nManager ignores me when I say a delivery truck is having mechanical issues and it results in me getting 16 hours in over time while I wait on the side of the road for rescue.

        "text": "I’ve created a new account, because while this story took place over a decade ago, it involves a governor and several flag officers in both the Marine Corps and Navy.  This is a story about nearly two years worth of malicious compliance, a story about what one motivated Marine and his regulation book can do.\n\n\nAfter graduating bootcamp and completing my training as an infantry machinegunner, I met with a 1stSgt who offered me the exciting opportunity to come to Annapolis MD and guard the US Naval Academy.  Well, kind of.  A 1stSgt asking a PFC if he'd like to do something... well it reminds me of the Louis CK drama.  Anyway, I was off to Annapolis for two years.  The schedule was brutal: twelve hours on post a day - for three days, followed by two days off (one of those being a training day).  I had many duties, but the worst was acting as gate sentry: armed parameter security.  The US Naval Academy is not a fun place to be for the junior enlisted, it is a very high pressure assignment as you are constantly surrounded by officers and politicians who could destroy you on a whim.  At the same time you are expected to be uncompromising in the fulfillment of your duties, as billet supersedes rank.  After about six months of that I realized that I wasn't going to make it.\n\n\nKnowing that nobody had ever been granted a duty station transfer before the two year mark, I started considering a conspicuously placed tattoo.  I knew it would be against regulation, and I'd get non-judicial punishment at the very least... wait a minute... regulation.  What if, in this highly political environment, I enforced every single regulation that exists?  Well that idea put me on a new mission, to become the largest nuance possible, while at the same time conducting myself in a way that would put me beyond reproach.  I set myself to memorizing every rule related to the facility and the military in general, orders made in the past that had never been amended and were long forgotten, I spent what little free time I had combing through the logbook graveyard - searching for wisdom from the sentries of the past.\n\n\nThe complaints started rolling in to my commanding officer, who then handed them off to the guard chief, who then chewed my ass.  We'll just call the guard chief Gunny, because that is what he was.  Gunny didn't want to be there either, he had been in the infantry his whole career - which is insane.  Gunny is the only Marine I ever met that had pulled that off, but the physical toll was obvious, as he appeared about 30 years older than he really was.  So Gunny and I got along in our way, Thursday was our standing appointment for my ass chewing.  After he made it through the stack of complaints, he'd have a list of orders designed to prevent that week's worth of complaints.  I never tried to play lawyer ball with Gunny's orders, as that would be a pretty dangerous game, luckily the pool of ridiculous regulations was pretty deep.\n\n\nSo that goes on for nearly a year.  By that time I'd developed a reputation for being a massive asshole.  Gunny figured that the best way to defuse the situation, while not giving me what I want - a ticket to Iraq, was to assign me to low traffic posts at odd hours.  That certainly slowed me down, until one fateful morning when a staffing issue led to me being put on the main gate for the very busy morning shift.  At that time civilians liked to be seen exercising on the Naval Academy grounds - running, cycling, etc.  Out of the early morning fog emerged a handful of men on bicycles, one without a helmet.  That was an easy one.  I informed the man that helmets were required in order to cycle on the Academy, and after he tried to lie to me about how he'd just walk his bike around the grounds - I ordered him off the property.  One of his helmeted companions explained to me that he was a police officer, and informed me that this man was currently the governor of Maryland.  I was genuinely unimpressed, as I'd regularly see folks like the Secretary of State.  They left and I made a note in my log book about the encounter.  The next morning I got assigned to the same gate for the same shift.  I almost laughed when I saw the governor show back up, this time with a bike helmet and a big grin.  He looked confused when I asked him to hand me his helmet.  After inspecting the helmet I handed it back and informed him that his bicycle helmet was missing the Snell safety certification sticker, again ordering him off the property.  Needless to say, he was upset, but eventually left.  I made another note in the log book, but didn't think much of it - I regularly ruined people's days.\n\n\nFast forward about a month.  Gunny comes speeding up to the guard post, nearly hanging out the window, already pointing and yelling at me.  It took me a couple of seconds to work out what he was yelling about, but when I finally did - I was terrified: \"Why the fuck does the Commandant of the Marine Corps know your name, what have you done?!  Get in the car, he wants to see you right now!1!!\".  So Gunny drove me back to the barracks, I changed into my dress blues, and we started the long and dead silent drive to Washington DC.  For those of you who aren't Marines, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is a four star general who runs the show - the spiritual leader for the entire branch, the father figure.  Upon arrival I was put in formation with a bunch of other Marines I didn't know, and the Commandant went down the line shaking hands and handing out challenge coins - all under the watch of a photographer.  We were then dismissed.  I was incredibly confused, but luckily Gunny had worked out what happened after talking to some other folks there.  On the drive home he explained to me that the Corps was not super excited about keeping a company of infantry Marines in Annapolis while the war raged in Iraq, but it was a long standing tradition that the Navy insisted on keeping.  So when the governor complained about me to the admiral running the Academy, who then complained to the Commandant of the Marine Corps... he was delighted.  I assume the Commandant mailed the photo to the USNA admiral.\n\n\nShortly after that I got orders to a unit deploying to Fallujah, which was heaven compared to Annapolis.  Also, I might have killed that old tradition - as I went back several years ago and found that Marines were no longer guarding the Naval Academy :)",

Much stifled laughter and hidden chocolate was shared with her in the school library where she conducted her remedial classes. As for the subject itself, I think I passed with a B.",

        "text": "Details changed a bit, blah blah.\n\nI work as a teacher and so does my spouse. We teach in the same district, and I’ve been working part-time for a few years since she makes enough for us to survive, and I’ve been studying to get a better degree. \n\nWith the previous administration, I had been told with my level of work I was probably going to end up getting a full-time position. I was praised and had been working more, doing more extra-curriculars on a volunteer basis, and helping other teachers. But then, our principal had to leave because she got a significantly better job. \n\nIn comes new guy. New guy is a classic “It’s all about me” dude. He told me, on the first day we really met, that I needed to dress more professionally. I literally dressed the same as my other co-workers... but I smiled and said ok, dressing up more than normal. He proceeded to continue to nit-pick my performance and micro-manage my classroom despite never having walked into it. I grew more and more frustrated, but kept my cool because what the fuck else am I gonna do. \n\nDuring this time, a friend of mine who’s an assistant principal from another district gives me a call. “Hey Cranthony, you looking for a job?” I was happy where I was at, not really looking to rock the boat, so I told him it was all good. He told me to stay in touch, calling every once in a while to check in.\n\nOne day, the principal calls me in to a meeting. I sit down, expecting to be berated, and he just looks at me and says “So, just wanna let you know, if you’re planning on looking for a full-time job, you should probably look elsewhere. I haven’t talked to finance about this yet, but we just don’t have the money.” I thought after I got my degree, I’d be able to teach full-time. I was little shocked, especially since he apparently just made this decision all on his own. \n\nSo, I went home and told my spouse. We thought for a while, unsure about what to do next. We agreed it sucked.\n\nNext day, I get a call from a certain assistant principal. “Hey Cranthony, this is it. We’re really going to be asking for applications now, so if you’re interested, you should send in your resume. It’s a full time job, with benefits.” \n\n“Hell yes.”\n\nThree weeks later I walk in with my two week notice. “What? You’re leaving?” (This was mid-April, now since it’s the end of the school year, classes are over). \n\n“Uh... yes? Are you surprised? You told me to get a full time job somewhere else.” \n\n“I am surprised! I had no idea you’d be able to get a new job so fast...” \n\nWell, fuck you, I did exactly what you asked. \n\nEdit: A word.",

        "text": "A few years ago while I was in the Navy, I had a fellow second class as a supervisor. Let’s call her S. Every once in awhile, S would stay up playing video games all night which would lead to her being pissy and straight up screaming at everyone at morning quarters.\n\nOne fine day, one of our most junior guys staggers into morning quarters late and looking like hell. Bloodshot eyes, stubble, uniform wrinkled to hell, reeking of fuel. We’d had 18 hours straight of flight operations the night before and he had to be on standby that whole time to refuel the birds whenever they came back. Kid had come straight from the flight deck. S went bananas. She tore into the poor kid while he stood there trying not to fall over from exhaustion. I started to speak up, to remind her that he had probably come straight from flight ops and she immediately started screaming at me for not taking responsibility for making sure that the juniors toe the line. She was screaming so hard her face had turned purple. Finally, she ended by telling me to “find something annoying” for the kid to do, that she did not want to see him all day (a.k.a. Make him do bitch work all day), that no one is supposed to help him and to make sure that he “did not go anywhere near his rack (bed) until after dinner.” Then she stormed out. Note: This would essentially mean that the kid would not be able to sleep after being up for 24 hours plus there was another 10 hours of flight ops scheduled for after dinner that day.\n\nKay.\n\nMe: Hey. You really don’t like stocking our storeroom, right?\nKid: Yeah.\nMe: Like, it’s really annoying for you to have to stock it right?\nKid: Yeah.\nMe: Good. We got some new parts yesterday. Go put them away. Make sure you put ALL the new parts away properly. It should take you until dinner time.\n\nKid is already looking pretty miserable. We usually get 10+ large boxes of parts with a shipment and S had a system setup where it was a pain to figure out which part went where. Usually I would be there to help because I knew where everything went at this point (My job to check for low supply and reorder).\n\nMe: It’s kind of cold in the storeroom, so make sure you bring a jacket with you. Here, take this blanket too (we use spare blankets to pad our very worn out chairs).\nKid: Uhh...okay?\nMe: And here’s the parts\n*hands him the small box of gaskets that we got the day before*\nMe: Make sure you put it all away properly. I don’t want to see you until dinner time.\n\nKid looks at me. Looks at box. Looks at blanket. Someone starts giggling. He looks at me again.\n\nKid: Dinner?\nMe: Dinner.\n\nHe looks at the box. Looks at me. Box. Me. Everyone’s giggling now.\n\nMe: And no one can help you. You heard what S said. You have to do this all by yourself. It will just be you in that storeroom all day. Make sure you put up the sign and lock the door so that no one walks in while you’re restocking.\n\nKid stares at me. Realization dawns. He stammers out a “Roger” and runs out. I dismiss the division and we go about our day. S asked me later that day where the kid was and I told her that I had assigned him to restock the storeroom with the new shipment by himself. She burst out laughing, crowing about how he’ll know better than to show up for “her” quarters looking like shit again. I just smile and hand her the shipment receipt form from the prior day’s shipment to sign off on, which she did, while still gloating over what she did to this kid.",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this belongs here but I think it fits. I was compliant and did what I was supposed to when there was a person hoping that I wouldn’t, or couldn’t. And I did it just to get back at him. For this story, back story for context is necessary. \n\n\nYears ago I worked as a server at a popular bar/restaurant. One day a couple came in (I honestly thought it was a man and his 14 year old daughter, but I digress) to eat and I served them and all went well. As they were leaving, the man told me he was a manager at another popular bar/restaurant in the area and he thought my service was great and offered me a job. \n\nI liked my job a lot and made decent money, but wanted to pick up more shifts during the week, and wanted to be a bar tender. Already financially secure and figuring I had nothing to lose, I told him that I liked my job, didn’t want to quit, would be interested in picking up day shifts as a bar tender. He counters that if I worked for him he wouldn’t want me to have another job as he would prefer to be my priority. I tell him I need to make x amount of dollars for rent, etc. and couldn’t leave my job unless I was guaranteed to make the same amount or more. He vaguely says “I think you’ll find you’ll be very well compensated.” \n\nSo I didn’t quit, but I did pursue picking up extra shifts at his restaurant. He wanted me to start as a busser, when asked why he said because it  was the most difficult job and if I could handle that then I could do anything. Ok.... doesn’t make sense to me but sure. Well 3 weeks into bussing tables I realized that I was *never* getting a bar tending job there or even a servers position. Their servers had worked for years waiting for a bar shift, and the hostess finally got one server shift after hosting for 2 years. \n\nThe man lied to me and actually tried to deceive me into quitting my job that paid my rent so i could clear tables for $50 a night. Once I realized this I quit without notice and he was forced to bus the tables that night. Later on he sent me angry text messages about how I was right, he never intended to give me a serving or bar tending job because I was the worst server he had ever experienced and that I should leave the industry because I was just terrible at it, etc. this is  the guy who tried to recruit me based on my service to his table when I had no idea he worked in the industry. \n\nWell whatever, glad I kept my job. Life went on. \n\nA couple of years later I’m still working at the same place I was. It’s late on a slow night. It’s just me and another kid working. Because it was so slow he had gotten drunk and was playing pool and it was basically just me working (this was fine with me because he never asked to split tips evenly when he knew he didn’t work as much, so I was making more money) \n\nSuddenly, shortly before the kitchen closes a part of 22 people comes in. They’re a local theater group coming in for a meal and some drinks, and guess who is a part of their larger group ! Asshole manager from the other restaurant ! He recognized me. Smirks at me smugly. \n\nSeeing all these people come in, my co worker gets off the pool table to come help me, I tell him no, I got this. I want to do this one all on my own. I’m going to be the best damn server this table of 22 people has ever had. I also had 3 other regular tables as well. \n\nI put a bunch of tables and chairs together and get started. Now large groups of people can be difficult. Especially large groups of broke artistic types like these theater folk. They usually want separate checks and don’t want to split the bill evenly. They will review their check and make sure you didn’t make any mistakes when divvying up the order. Often you might bring the right appetizer to the wrong person, forget who wanted a lemon with their water and who didn’t, etc. the kitchen might even make a mistake. \n\nI will not make a single mistake. Not even a small one. I stayed on top of the kitchen staff to make sure they didn’t, either. I usually didn’t need a pad to write orders but with this table I actually drew a chart with little circles for each seat where i kept track of every appetizer, meal and drink ordered for each seat. I made sure I was attentive to everyone, refilled water when necessary, basically did my job but made sure I did it very well and still handled my other 3 tables. And I was polite and cheerful. Oh my god I was so polite and cheerful. Especially to the Asshole. I knew he wanted me to fuck up. He wanted the satisfaction of me making a mistake or many mistakes and being overwhelmed by his 21 friends complaining while he kept smirking at me smugly silently saying “I told you you were terrible at this.” But I did not allow that to happen. \n\nWhen all was said and done, I pulled it off. Towards the end they tried to surprise me with a “we need separate checks” statement (for 22 people you should really state this at the beginning) but I was not bamboozled, I had been keeping track of their individual orders the whole time. They all reviewed their checks and no one had a single complaint. I made no mistakes. \n\nOne by one they all left, only one person stayed behind. It was the asshole. He waited until his friends left and he said to me “i just  wanted to tell you, that was great service.” It was all the apology and acknowledgment that he knew he was a dick that  I could want, and I was satisfied. I smiled and politely said “thank you.” \n\n",

Both hard working, family men who valued their customers and understood customer service.  Out of the two brothers, the older one had a very mischievous way of dealing with situation, a malicious compliance expert one can say. \n\nStory begins with older gentleman  or old guy \\(OG\\) walking into the pizza store. He asked where the owners where at which point the younger brother \\(YB\\) replies that he's one of them. OG lamented that the previous owners were friends of his and that they had the best cheese pizza in the world. Mind you,  ownership had changed over a decade at this point. YB said that they do pretty good pizza too and asks him if he wants to try anything. \n\nOG then asks for a small cheese pizza.  YB yells the order back to the Older Brother \\(OB\\) who was doing the prep that day.  As OB confirms the order, OG pipes up and asks if they can put one or two olives on the pizza. OB asks if he wants an olive pizza but OG says no, just a peck to change the color. OB says sure. OG then says if while he's at it he can add maybe one or two onions. I see the glint on OB's eyes and know he's preparing something. With all the charm and friendliness he could call up,  OB asks if perhaps he would like maybe one or two mushrooms? OG says : \"that would be great! maybe while you're at it maybe throw one or two pieces of pepperoni too?\" OB: \" not a problem\" your \"special pizza will be out in 15\".  Pizza comes out, OB boxes it and asks me to step away from the register and calls OG up to pay. \n\nOB: Your pizza is ready\n\nOG: Thank you. Here's the $5.50 \\(this was a while\\) for a small cheese\n\nOB: Small cheese? Lets' see, you have mushrooms, onions, peppers, pepperoni and olives on here. This is a 'special' and it's $8.50\n\nOG: It's a small cheese with one or two topings... how is it special. \n\nOB: Points to menu and reads the ingredients off for a House of Pizza Special which were what was on the one he made of OG. \n\nOG: Well I ordered a small cheese, not a special, \n\nOB: I can make you a small cheese if you like, but this one is a special. \n\nOG: Forget it. Not coming here again.\n\nOB: I'm sorry to hear that, we were looking forward to winning you as a customer.\n\nOG: huffs and leaves. \n\nOlder brother hands me the pizza and asks if I had lunch yet. I took the pizza and ate it and it was great. He got what he asked for but did not like what was asked to pay.  And it was all done with a smile by the owners. ",

        "text": "So this one goes back to high school calculus in the mid-90s. Daily homework, do problems out of the textbook, typical stuff. Write out the steps you take to solve the problem so the teacher knows you didn't cheat using a calculator or whatnot. Sure.\n\nBut I'm really good at this stuff. I can do loads of it in my head. So mostly in the interest of saving paper, I combine a lot of steps. I still write down enough that you can track what I'm doing, but let's say for a problem where the average student might have 10 steps down, I do it in 5. I really could have done it in less than that but I thought it was a reasonable compromise, enough to show I was merely very clever and not cheating.\n\nThe teacher is not pleased by this. Why does it matter? Well, allegedly when you take the Advanced Placement test, they reduce your score if steps are not properly shown. Okay, well, then for the AP text I'll show the steps like a normal person, but for daily homework there's still no reason to. It's not as if I'm going to lose the ability to show all the steps if I don't practice at it.\n\nTeacher eventually has enough of this, and hands back my homework marked down 50% for not showing all the steps. Oh, by the way, she really procrastinated in grading our homework, so we'd get them back in large batches. So with no real warning, I've suddenly got about a month's worth of assignments marked down 50%. This is enough to pull my quarter grade down to a C, which means even with As in the other quarter and the final, my semester grade couldn't be higher than a B. I was a straight A student, so this was absurd. If I'd known she was going to go that far, if it had been *one* night's homework marked down to show she meant it, I probably would have given in. Instead we've gone from defcon: all clear to my GPA is impacted in zero seconds flat.\n\nCommence emergency parent-teacher conference.\n\nAt conclusion of negotiations, my quarter grade is raised to a B, putting a semester grade of A back in reach, and I'm going to show my steps from now on.\n\nCommence passive-aggressive smart-assery. If she's gonna be a petty witch over this, I can play too.\n\nI'm supposed to show *all* my steps, right? I mean at this point there's a certain amount of stuff that it's expected everybody just does in their head. Like algebra-level stuff we learned two years ago. But *I'm* not allowed to do steps in my head, they have to be written down, right? So that problem where an average student might use 10 steps? I make it take at least 20. Probably more like 30.\n\nAt first I crammed it all onto the page in a massive block of math. Teacher didn't like that either. It should be one line per step. Okay, fine. Homework that should have taken me one piece of paper, I now handed in as a five page behemoth. She never called me out on it beyond that, I got my semester A and top score on the AP test, and that was that.",

        "text": "So in my early 20s (21) I start working as a Phlebotomist (I drew blood in a large hospital). I had just moved and knew no one and also just didn’t know the area/city. I worked evening shift 1300-2130. After completing the training I was put on my normal shift with my fellow workers who to my surprise were all my age or younger. We became fast friends! Great peeps!\n\nFast forward a year, our shift is the busiest shift for STAT draws and Traumas in ER, the pace is tough but we’re great friends and we handle it and help each other out a lot. All the hospital staff for the most part know us and love us for our hard work and professionalism. \n\nOur boss let’s call her Karen, solely works day shifts and has no idea really what it’s like on our shift. She loves to nit pick about silly things and she doesn’t feel like she is accomplishing anything unless she is telling you where you’re wrong and how you can improve. \n\nOur shift is 3 guys and 1 girl, we all dress in scrubs with a T-shirt underneath. We usually wear any kind of T-shirt as long as you can only see a solid color and it matches/ looks ok. \n\nKaren one day notices and reminds us all that the handbook specifically says that our undershirts have to be white, and that with colored undershirts we are very unprofessional. \n\nI make a remark about all of crazy colored/printed/ graphics of the scrub tops on dayshift( who are all female) and how I don’t think having our undershirts are any more unprofessional than a spongebob scrub top. She explicitly says they are permitted in the handbook but our undershirts were not and we better fix it ASAP and the next person to show up to work without a white undershirt will be sent home to change. \n\nSo later that night I have a solid idea and propose it to my awesome evening shift cohorts, let’s all go out and buy white undershirts, along with the most outrageous and ridiculous scrub tops we can find. My idea is praised and we all go shopping after work. \n\nThe next day me meet in parking lot and all walk in together, my buddy Jonas is sporting a black scrub top covered in vivid red smooching lips, Will is looking very professional in a white top with strawberry shortcake cartoon images all over, and I’m wearing a baby blue and pink Dora the Explorer scrub top, all with white undershirts. \n\nWe walk in and there is lots of laughing and yelling and we draw a crowd in the lab, in walks Karen. Her face turns red as we proudly display our commitment to professionalism and our 100% handbook dress code compliant outfits. She mutters a thank you and scurries off to consult the director who is awesome, the director laughed and said “well, you won Karen, they’re compliant” \n\nWe became famous all across the hospital for our Malicious Compliance and occasionally wore our fun scrubs to work for the rest of our time together.  Great times!",

        "text": "As a teenager, I had a stocker job at Wal-mart. They were constantly asking me to do things that were against labor laws and usually I complied because at the time I was just an ignorant teenager and didn't know better...usually. Now, there is one day out of the year that our store became absolutely slammed and everyone worked their ass off. That day was the day that they started accepting lay away for Christmas. This was a particularly brutal day because everyone and their grandma came to the store to start throwing merchandise into lay away. These objects (usually bicycles, large big ticket items, huge children's toys like power wheels, etc) would then start to fill up the back room. We'd have to move them upstairs into the attic after that room was full, and then we had a few metal shipping containers out back that we'd start loading. It was a TON of physical labor for the three people they had doing it all day long.\n\nOf course, on this day, I was desperately looking forward to my lunch break. I was a hungry growing kid and I had spent hours loading heavy objects. My manager comes up to me and says, \"take as long as you need on your break.\" She repeated this to me several times with a meaningful look. What she was actually saying was that I should cut my lunch break short and get back to work. You know, breaking more labor laws and such. \n\nI assured her that I would take only as much time as I needed. I went to a local burger joint and picked up a few burgers and went to my grandma's house. I chilled with her and watched an entire episode of Days of Our Lives. Then I laid on her couch and took an hour nap. After that, I drank a Dr. Pepper and helped grandma do a crossword puzzle and then I went back to work feeling refreshed and ready for action.\n\nMy manager was FURIOUS. She started screaming at me about where I had been and demanded that I explain or I would be fired. I said, \"You said to take as long as I needed.\"\n\nThe look on her face was priceless. \n\nWe got back to work and nothing more was said.",

        "text": "Long story, tl;dr at the end. In order for readers to understand everything, I’m giving you two elements.  I’m a first time poster but long time lurker who enjoys the Malicious Compliance stories, but also the Pro Revenge section ;\\).  I hope you like the formatting, I'm on pc.\n\n1. In this country, the first 30 days of sick leave are paid by employer.  After these 30 days, social security picks up the tab.  If there is at least 30 days of work between the first 30 days sick leave and another set of 30 days sick leave, then these next 30 days sick leave are also paid by employer.\n\n2. I’m not going to state my profession, partly because I don’t want to be recognized, partly because I think a lot of people will be able to relate to this story regardless their profession.  All I’m saying is that I work in a high profile administrative function that allows people perfectly well to work from home \\(this is important later on\\)\n\nThis happened quite a few years ago.  I managed together with one colleague a lot of work.  When I started working there, It was easy to reach.  One train, 45 minutes.  Then the company moved address.  My daily trajectory doubled in time and, having a family, I applied to work from home 1 day per week.\n\nMy boss did not want to hear about it.  Even worse, shortly afterwards he announced that he would start to work from home by himself.  He had a company car, but the traffic was ooooh sooo long every day \\(less than the time I spent, but well, he’s a lazy guy …\\).  He was the type that would tell everyone orally and by email, and sometimes in a very menacing tone, to respect the clock and not come late or leave early.  He, on the other hand, was always the last to come in \\(late, of course\\) and the first to leave \\(early, of course\\).  Imagine just how we all felt about this.  Listen to what I say but don’t look at what I do.  Leadership by example, you know what I mean?  In terms of salary, he was also a dishonest person.  We were all underpaid by 10\\-15&amp;#37; at least, but we loved our jobs and I kept it because I needed a bit of money in the short term.\n\nI already knew for quite some time that at some point, I would need to have surgery performed \\(twice!\\) and that that would mean that I could not work twice for 3\\-4 weeks.  So the moment comes when the doctor tells me that the surgery can’t be avoided anymore.  It was nothing life\\-threatening and it's been performed successfully.  I tell the boss about the upcoming surgery and his first reaction is: “oh my god, you’ll be gone for 3\\-4 weeks in a few weeks from now, and that repeats itself a second time in two months.  We will need to stay in touch in case we have questions about your work.” My answer: “no you don’t.  A few years ago you told me I can’t work from home, you wouldn’t allow it and one of the things a manager really has to be is that they are consequent between what they say and what they do.  Don’t turn your coat the way the wind blows.  On top of that, I’m on sick leave and contacting people whilst they are on sick leave is out of order”.  What I thought \\(but did not say\\) was that I was also underpaid and that I was taking paid sick leave just to put the cherry on the cake I was serving him.  He wasn’t happy I forced him to respect his own rules.  He tried to manipulate me into contacting me anyway during sick leave but I relayed the situation to headquarters who followed me all along \\(he wasn’t really well liked there\\).\n\nTwo months later, next surgery, same story, and by then he was really pissed, because he’d understood that, first, I forced him to respect his own rules, and second, that the company would pick up the full salary tab for two months without any work done from me.  On top of it all, the hospital insurance from employer ensured I could have this surgery performed without spending anything noteworthy.  See that as a compensation for the time I was underpaid :\\)\n\nShortly after second surgery, I quit for a better paying job \\+30&amp;#37;, which is above my expectations :\\)\n\nTl;dr: boss does not authorize me to work from home but does it himself, so I take in total two months off to have necessary surgery performed and the full salary tab is for the company because of laws in this country.",

We decided everyone would chip in $20 and 2 of the guys would go buy a bunch of 6 packs of different stuff to try. I had to go to work but I gave my $20 before I left. Sal said he didn’t have any cash but would pay us back later. A third roommate said he was heading to the ATM and Sal could go with him. Sal said he was too tired but promised to pay his $20 that night before we started drinking. \n\nWhen I got home from work, the fridge was stocked with at least 10 different 6 packs of bottles along with a 6 pack of natty light. I was told that Sal hadn’t paid and they’d picked up the Natty Light just for him if he didn’t chip in.\n\nWhen Sal came downstairs without his $20, he was told that out of the kindness of our hearts we’d still picked him up something even though he didn’t pay. When he saw the Natty Light he was NOT happy. \n\nWe proceed to play the card game a$$hole and for those who don’t know, the order in which you finish determines who gets to boss who around for the next round. President can tell everyone what to do, then VP, all the way down to the         a$$hole. \n\nSal has been complaining the whole time about having to drink Natty so we all agree to a deal that if he finishes all 6 Natty’s he can start drinking the good beer. This cheers him up a bit and he picks up his drinking pace. By the time he’s on his 5th Natty, he wins the round and becomes president for the next game. I come in last (I’m the a$$hole) and Sal says “Hey a$$hole, I’m ready to drink some good beer. Why don’t you chug this last one for me?” And he hands me the sixth Natty Light.\n\nI say “Are you sure?” \n\n“Yes, drink it!”\n\nSo I pick up the beer and chug the entire thing and then with a sad face say “Oh no! Sal, I just realized that we said YOU had to drink these 6 beers if you wanted the good stuff.”\n\nHe starts cussing and complaining and stomps up to his room and the rest of us had a great time drinking and playing card games for the rest of the night.\n\nSide note: We may not have been the most exciting people in college.",

Lots of crimes against a certain group of people that wanted to escape there. The army men  were basically killing those people, shooting them to be precise, and the doctors in the hospital had to give false causes of death (to hide the fact that they’re committing mass murder).  While the other doctors wrote stuff like fell to his death, died in a car accident, etc. My  grandpa, not giving a fuck, wrote on every single case that they died of “acute lead poisoning ”, since they were killed by lead bullets to the head. After a month, the government found out about this, and just sent him back home, saying he completed his internship.  \n\nHe didn’t get the position of a professor at college because of this, but he didn’t care much, I guess he was glad he wasn't acutely poisoned by lead as-well.  \n\nEdit: spelling",

        "text": "This happened last Tuesday/Wednesday. I work 8\\-6 overnights at a large grocery store chain, from around 11\\-5 it is only me in the store. Tuesday I come in for my shift and my manager informs me that someone from another franchise will be coming to pick up a skid/pallet of Pasta Sauce, that they have run out of, and we have way too much of. No problem.\n\nAround 3am the bell to the receiving door rings and I let in a younger guy, late teens/early 20's. He is on his bluetooth talking to someone on the phone, and eating a giant freezie, which every so often he has a bite of, and then spits on ground? Wtf? Anyways, here is the problem. We have both a power jack and  few pump jacks in the store, but our power jack was away for maintenance, shitty. Pump jacks work fine, but for skids that are massively heavy like water, pasta sauce, etc you really can't pull/push them around. If another person pushes with you, you can get some momentum and it makes it a lot easier once you get going. This skid of pasta sauce is basically an immovable object. I signal to the guy and say 'Hey can you give this a push so I can get rolling and pull it on the truck?'.\n\n\"Not my job, bro\". I told him it was nearly impossible for me to move this without a power jack or assistance. He told me in so many words it had to go on the truck because they needed the product at their store this morning. I proceeded for the next 25 minutes to creep this skid inch by inch toward the truck with all the strength I had, while he stood there and watched while talking on the phone. I got it up the ramp, barely onto the trailer, and dropped it.\n\n\"Thats gotta go to the back of the trailer, yo\".\n\nFor those that do not know, a skid of product that isn't pushed to the back of a box trailer, will tip over 99&amp;#37; of the time, regardless of how careful the driver is. I told him it was on the truck and my job was done. I figured he'd relent and help me move it to a safer spot in the trailer. Instead he stood there for a few minutes and then proceeded to yell at me, call me a fag and tell me he better not catch me outside of the store. Before storming out the door, he spit some of his freezie my way, hitting my pant leg.\n\nAt around 6am the phone rings, I pick up and recognize the voice on the other end. I started working with this company at 15 \\( I am 29 now\\). It was the guy who trained me when I first started, got me into a full time position from part time, and basically showed me everything I know about work. Needless to say we are very close. He had since moved up to be a franchisee at a different location, the location where the skid of pasta sauce was going.\n\n\"Hey Bluesnowmanz, did you put that sauce the truck like that? It tipped and nearly all of it is damaged, did you know that was for me?\". I apologized and said I didn't know it was going to his store. I then explained how our power jack was unavailable, asked his guy for help, refused, got called a fag, spit at, etc. He said hang on and set the phone down. I could hear him call the guy over and absolutely lay into him, just yelling, couldn't make out too many words. I imagine the entire situation something like this \n\n[https://youtu.be/SbgKYhX8\\_gs?t=82](https://youtu.be/SbgKYhX8_gs?t=82)\n\nGuy gets back on the phone and says tomorrow night he needs to send the truck again \\(to actually get sauce this time\\), and to let the driver put the skid on the truck himself. Gotcha.\n\nGuy shows up the following night around the same time, looking like a scolded dog. He grabs a pump jack and heads towards the skid of sauce. I left the area and went back to what I had been doing. I returned about 40 minutes later to see the guy drenched in sweat, out of breath, and with the skid moved about a whopping 10 feet from where it was originally parked. He looked like he was going to/ had started crying. At this point I relented and started to push from the other side. We had it on the trailer and secured in about 30 seconds.\n\nThe guy was so out of breath he could barely get out \"Thanks man\", before he exited the back door.",

I look at my drink. There's whipped cream on top and the glass is warm. \n\n\"Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I actually ordered a chocolate milk.\" \n\nVisibly annoyed, she snaps the drink off the table without a word. \n\nShe returns shortly, half slams the drink down, and leaves, again, without a word. We look down. It's filled with ice and whipped cream remnants. \n\nI was still a young lad when this happened, so when the original waitress returned with our food, I told her everything looked good. I got about halfway through the iced hour chocolate before I tapped out. \n\nI don't know what I did - if anything - to deserve to be so maliciously complied with, but as a former disgruntled food service worker, I appreciated her hustle.

Slower new guy was working the bread and meat section and experienced girl was on veggies and wrapping. I had just gotten there so I jumped on register. First couple orders are slow to come out due to new guy but it goes smooth enough. Enter Stubborn Jerk (SJ) and kids. SJ is pleasent enough, naming his sandwiches and informing me of his mobile coupon while his sandwiches are being veggied. Hands me his phone with shown coupon and I start to look for it on my register. \nIt's not there. \nI explain to him that even though the coupon is valid, for some reason it is not available or even on my screen. I tell him I will ring up the closest discount I have which is 2 footlong subs for $12. Good deal. His coupon is buy a footlong and a drink, get a footlong for $1.49. He is buying 4 footlongs, 2 chips, and 3 drinks. \nSo I ring up the items, select the 2 for $12 discount, tell him his total is $26.xx. \nSJ- No, that isn't right. The meals are with these cheaper subs and the expensive sub is $1.49.  \nMe- I'm sorry sir, our system doesn't let us choose how the meals ring up. We type in the items and it groups them as meals. \nSJ- You're overcharging me. Is there a manager I can speak to leakynipple? This is wrong. \nMe- Yes I can call her. \nCall my manager and she says take off one of the subs. Policy is take off cheaper item. \nMe- Ok you're new total is $30.xx. Honestly, the discount I tried giving you is a better deal. \nSJ- No that's still wrong! Take off the expensive sub! I didn't make these coupons and you need to honor them!\nTotally done with this rude attitude, I take off the expensive sub and replace the cheaper sub. Read off his new order and yet again explain I can't control how it determines the meals. \nMe- Ok. You're new total is $27.xx. \nSJ pays and takes his kids to sit and eat, glaring at me the entire time. \nTl; dr Rude customer refused the better coupon and paid more to get a deal. ",

In one case, in New Mexico, there is a border control checkpoint some 50 miles from the border...on a military base...in the absolute most barren desert ever...on a bombing range. No one's sneaking around there guys, go home. I had to deal with these a lot when I drove around the southwest for work. I finally had had enough and decided to be as precise in my answers as humanly possible. I sought to disrupt through compliance\n\n**Scene:** waiting in line I turn my cell phone video camera on to record what was to come next. I was 6ish hours into a 9 hour drive at the start of a long week of work. I was driving a standard contractor work van with all my gear and so forth in it.

Do you look in your trunk when you stop to take a leak?\n\n[reader note...at this point what is typically a 5 second interaction where they 'look for suspicious vehicles', i.e.- brown people, has taken upwards of 3 minutes...it's a one lane checkpoint...I'm blocking all traffic]\n\n**ONH:** (with utter hatred in his eyes) Do you mind if I look in the back of your vehicle?\n\n**Me:** Well its not my vehicle\n\n**ONH:** *It's not your vehicle?*\n\n**Me:** No, it's my boss [name], I mean really its [company name]. [boss name] is great to work for, he used to...\n\n**ONH:** (cuts me off) may I look in the back of *this* vehicle\n\n**Me:** I'm not sure I'm comfortable making that decision for my boss, I can call him if you want, but it's his vehicle really...\n\n**ONH:** No. So I can't look in the back of the vehicle\n\n**Me:** I mean, I wish, I just can't make that decision for someone else's property\n\n**ONH:** Stay here (said as he turns around and starts talking to his radio)\n\n**Me:** Sure thing, where would I go? I'm just trying to help\n\n**ONH:** (physically cringes)\n\n[at this point, another officer with a drug dog comes over and the handler makes a loop around my van. I may have slightly rolled onto the accelerator with the van in park...this was in like August...it was hot out.

        "text": "Final couple of weeks of high school, many years ago.\n\nUp until then, it was customary for the seniors who Have Had Enough Of This Shit to just toss their coursework up in the air on the last day of school, because YES, it was finally over.\n\nHowever, my last year there...the administrators were sick of this shit, so they decided that to fix this problem, they were going to ban backpacks entirely during the last two weeks of school. The message: **USE YOUR LOCKERS, JERKS**. Except we never used them for good reason: They were the very same lockers that had been there since the 60s when the school was built and the locks on the lockers were very prone to jamming and making you late since you had all of 5 minutes to make it to your next class, sometimes across the entire campus.\n\nWhen the announcement came down, however, I (and some others) noticed that it specifically called out backpacks. Not laptop bags, not satchels, none of that. I had to carry a laptop to school (to take notes and to use in my networking class), and I wasn't about to let some expensive machine rot in a dirty locker/get carried out in the open with no protection.\n\nSo to skirt the rule, I got the biggest, thickest laptop bag and kept all my stuff in it. Multiple campus supervisors tried to confiscate my bag and everything in it until the end of the school year, but I pointed out in the very announcement that only backpacks were banned; laptop bags, garbage bags, douche bags or any sort of other bags were not banned as spelled out in the announcement. After enough times arguing they finally just let it go and left me be.\n\nHowever...the true malicious compliance bit came in what the rest of the outgoing class that year did. The administration said to use your lockers, right? That's what they did. The days before the ban went into effect, everyone just unloaded their backpacks into their lockers. The administration, thinking they won, were satisfied. Didn't do locker inspections, didn't check to make sure their ban had any unintended consequences, or anything like that.\n\nFinal day rolls around, and this is the day where we're supposed to say our goodbyes for the summer/forever if we're seniors, clear our lockers, so on and so forth. As you can guess, the seniors went to their lockers to clear them out, and clear they did, grabbing all the coursework (actually *more*) that would have fit into their bags, and threw it. all. over. the. place.\n\nThey did exactly as the administration wanted, they used the lockers. But not for their intended purpose. You ban one way of doing things, sometimes people will find a way to get it done anyway.",

I attempt to explain that there is really no way for her to get a nice, white-blonde by tomorrow.\n\nAnd this is where it got good.\n\nA: “Are you a damn cosmetologist? Did you go to school?”\n\nMe: “No ma’am but I do have naturally dark hair that I regularly bleach. I stay platinum for the most part. If you would like to come in later, our assistant manager MIGHT be here but I make no promises.”\n\nA: “Well then I’ll wait.”\n\nMe: “Ma’am she very well may not make it in, our manager wrecked her car and the traffic is blocking her ability to get here.”\n\nShe gives me a glare.

You would fry your hair and end up with it shaved like my coworkers sides over there.”\n\nHer face went pale.\n\nI grinned, honestly. It felt amazing.\n\nShe left with her tail between her legs.\n\nTL;DR - Lady waited 10 hours to be told exactly what I told her, except she wanted to hear it by an actual hair dresser.\n",

        "text": "There is this organic grocery store/food venue in my town that is referred to as the public market. Inside, there are four family run food venues in addition to the produce and groceries for the following cuisine: Ethiopian food, smoothies, sushi, and a coffee bar that also serves baked goods from a local bakery. \n\nThe produce is expensive and the grocery section is pretty scarce, they have a difficult time competing with the co-op and cheaper grocery stores in the area. However, the food venues are all really good and there’s nearly always an available table where I can perch for hours and do homework without having to worry about getting hungry. The market is also pretty close to my house and rarely crowded on week days so I like going there when I need a place to focus. I think it’s important to mention that all venues require you to clear your own table, so I had never sat around for hours while people waited on me. \n\nAnyway, it is normal for me to get there in the morning or early afternoon and leave shortly before they closed. Every time I go, I eventually buy something from the remaining snack selection on the shelves or one of the food venues. I don’t always buy something immediately, but I definitely keep mindful about purchasing more than one snack or beverage, or indulging in sushi, if I stay for a long time. A few months ago, I went to the market to work on a large social welfare policy paper I had procrastinated on and scored one of my favorite tables. \n\nI purchased a coffee before sitting down and had been working for a couple hours when the women who runs the coffee stand (coffee lady) approached me out of the blue. To paraphrase, she told me that she has noticed I have been coming to the market more frequently and she hopes I keep in mind that I should always purchase something if I am going to sit at one of the tables. She went on to clarify she felt I had not purchased anything in a while and was still at one of her “best tables” (all the tables, of which there are quite a few, are for all the food venues to share, and there were literally two or three other customers in the entire building at the time) and if I wanted to stay there or spend full afternoons and days in the market I should start spending more money. Granted, she also said that it didn’t have to be from her stand, but it seriously caught me off guard. I explained that I try to be mindful about doing exact what she had just old me, and she responded with a short tangent about how she is just trying to get by and is not afraid to be aggressive about it. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and sympathize with the fact she is trying to support a family. I wrote it off and told myself she was probably having a particularly stressful day. After this interaction, I found myself buying a scone or latte (as opposed to just drip) from her when I went to the market out of guilt. \n\nHowever, a few weeks ago I show up to the market and notice coffee lady is nowhere to be seen. I wait by her counter awkwardly for a few minutes before I caught the eye of the cashier at the smoothie stand, I’ll call her smoothie girl. It was a hot day despite being early, so I decided to just get a smoothie instead and figured the coffee bar was closed. I ended up recognizing her from school, so we chatted a bit after I ordered since nobody else was in line. I asked her if the coffee lady had to close for the day and she responded by deeply sighing and muttering “she’s the worst” while shaking her head. She told me that the coffee lady regularly disappears for long stretches of time, regardless of if a customer is waiting. She told me other staff used to go try to find her to tell her customers are waiting for coffee, but they stopped after she snapped at someone for bothering her and that “they can wait for good coffee”. I told her about my experience with her and she apologized on her behalf, but said she wasn’t surprised. She also told me that the coffee lady is the reason they moved this big water dispenser they used to have near all the communal tables behind their station. Apparently, homeless folks were coming in to drink water (you know, as humans do) and the lady couldn’t take the fact they were entering the market and freely drinking the water and wanted to get rid of it. They salvaged it first though and give water to anyone who asks. \n\n\nAnyway, since then I always bring my own coffee from home or one of the many coffee joints in my town. I also made sure to spend money at any venue but her coffee counter. After all, I don’t have to spend money there to have her permission to be in the building, right? She hasn’t approached me as of yet thankfully, but she has definitely given me dirty looks while I’m working and has directed glares towards my outside coffee cups. Sucks to suck, coffee lady. \n",

We had a large sports team (40+) scheduled for 6:30pm. They have called multiple times today and asked for a manager, and then proceeded to tell them the team is on a strict budget and ask if they can offer discounts, throw in free drinks, etc. The managers have very clearly told them no, we don’t offer any discount like that, but generally we do buy the bus driver’s food, which is a weird rule, but whatever. \n\nAnyway, the team still decides to come, they all get waters and share large orders of wings. Except for, can you believe it, the bus driver. The bus driver orders 3 appetizers, a large order of wings (which can easily feed 3-4 people), and four sides. Her personal tab was around $60.\n\nGuess we should have a limit on what bus drivers can order 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nTL;DR: Sports team was told restaurant cannot provide discount but will pay for bus driver’s food.

        "text": "I posted my first malicious compliance a couple of days ago regarding my compulsory reflective   essay. This story concerns the actual work experience itself which occurred around a year later. \n\nThe work experience was supposed to be for 4 weeks or 2, depending on hours you worked etc. You had to get a form signed by your 'employer' which was like a timesheet. \n\nAs you can see in my previous post I thought these classes were a waste of time. \n\nI went to the work experience coordinator who remembered me from last year (and still probably hated my face) and she said...\n\n\"We'll be checking your timesheet very carefully, please make sure that it's all in order... I wouldn't want to fail you\".\n\nI just shrugged it off and submitted my work experience request. They checked out the business i had requested to work with and it was all legit so they greenlit it. \n\nThe business I was working with was a small one run by my grandfather. I worked there sometimes during the summer for a bit of extra money. It wasn't a huge moneymaker, just enough to keep my grandad busy and to make him some pocket money. They called him to confirm he was the owner and that he was willing to let me do work experience etc etc. He agreed. \n\nI turn up at his business when my experience is due to start, my grandad is stood there and the conversation goes ...\n\nG: why are you here ? \n\nD: my work experience grandad ? \n\nG: yeah... but you know what to do here and I only really need help during summer. I have salaried people to do the work they want you to do for free. \n\nD: so what do you want me to do ? \n\nG: don't waste your time here. I'll sign your timesheet, use it to study or something. \n\nSo I happily go on my way and spend a month playing Xbox, reading and doing essays. \n\nWhen our work experience class meets up a month or so later, we all have our results back and I've passed the class (and well). As the class file out of the room, the work experience coordinator has this venomous smile on her face and asks me if \"the work experience was so tough\". \nI start laughing and she can't understand why, her smile falters. \n\nI tell the work experience coordinator about my work experience  and she's apoplectic with rage. \nI asked her if my timesheet was all in order and her face just blanched as she put two and two together. I have a signed timesheet as she stipulated and a business owner who will confirm he signed the timesheet, all my paperwork was in order and I know the business well enough to describe my duties. \n\nShe ended up leaving the college six months later because apparently I wasn't the only one who found this loophole out and it got out amongst academic staff. \n\nTLDR; work experience coordinator was \"keeping close eye\" on my paperwork. my grandad told me work experience with him was basically a waste of time and signed everything off so I wouldn't get in trouble.
