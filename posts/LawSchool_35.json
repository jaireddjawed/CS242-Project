Here is my info.\n\nGraduated from Rutgers in 2016 with a BA in biological sciences with the pre med classes\n\nDid a lot of internships, volunteered at hospitals and did research at medical universities in NJ.\n\nWent to podiatry school afterward for 1 year in NYC passed the first semester and failed the second.\n\nThen started studying for the lsat did not do well, then did a coding bootcamp learned CSS, HTML, Javascript, got a job as an IT auditor at HSBC in a contract role for 12 months. Due to the economy was let go after 3 months and this was not performance related as my supervisor wrote me a great reference letter. Got let go second week of oct 2022 and since then been trying to figure out what to do. I have some money saved about 30k in student loan debt from medical school and non from undergrad. I worked and still have my substitute teaching certs that can provide some income although I hate doing it. \n\nRight now I am going back to study for the lsat and have signed up to take it in April. I don't want any regrets and feel like I could combine my bio major with law school and do patent law. \n\nIn case that does not work out, I am also applying to the Rutgers B School MBA in professional accounting program which is for students who have no background in accounting. It is 14 months and has an internship in the winter break period. It will also set me up to take the CPA exam with the 24 accounting and 24 gen business credits. The program is 14months, 60k tuition and is 20 min from my house.  In this scenario, if I get a good lsat score I could apply for next year and in the meantime do this program and down the line be in a great position to work as a tax attorney. \n\nI just wanted to know what you think of this plan and is it a good one going forward for someone in my position. I enjoy business, tech, and law but I also understand the value that comes with having a license to do something for example in accounting and law you can get the cpa or bar license. \n\nI was also looking at going back to school to get a bachelors in computer science from Rutgers and I do get instate tuition discount for that as well as the masters program. But that would be a bachelors degree and from the admin person I spoke with it would take 2-3 years to complete. I do not know if they have any programs for people in my situtation with a non tech degree to do possibly a masters. I am really confused on what I should do with my life and so writing this post is kind of cathartic in a sense. I am just not sure if I am making the right decision going into law and accounting. I spoke to my sister who does data science at a big 4 accounting firm. She did IT then masters in DS. She is so busy and so doesn't have time to talk sometimes. But she did say to try for the lsat and if it doesn't work out I could always do tech through these online masters programs or other shorter online programs. She says not to go back for a bachelors as it would not be a good look and to get a masters.   My one issue with this is the loans being higher for a masters than an undergrad but the time would be saved. I am going to turn 30 in June so my family is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on me to figure out my career and have stability so this has been so stressful that I can't sleep at night due to the worrying and my hair is thinning.",

Worse yet, the surgeon who did this to me is a professor at the medical school within my University. Anyway, I failed my Crim class. My LSAT was well above the median score at my school, I have a scholarship, and so this is severely disappointing. My professor let me know the reason for failing was because I skipped 3 short answer Qs (ran out of time). Don‚Äôt really know how this caused me to fail when they were presumably worth less than the multiple long-answers + the lowest grade was a C, besides me. But I digress. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm honestly thinking of dropping out within the next few days so as to not waste an entire semester if I do decide it isn‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôm also really upset because the Dean was in the loop about my whole situation and it never occurred to her to tell me that I could petition for an incomplete or a W given the situation, despite the fact that I asked what my options are. I can retake the class &amp; substitute the new grade into my GPA, but the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù will stay on my transcript. I‚Äôm miserably upset because I know there‚Äôs nothing more I could of done. I would 100% take responsibility if I did believe I were at fault here, but I couldn‚Äôt go back in time to prevent my accident. Should I drop out? Am I screwed? I truly appreciate any advice provided.",

        "text": "This is a vent. I can‚Äôt take it anymore and this needs to be said. Day in and day out, from deans, professors, other students, Reddit, this is all you hear and it needs to stop. \n\nFor one thing, everyone knows you‚Äôre lying. You can‚Äôt tell students ‚Äúfocus on your grades‚Äù, ‚Äúthe best thing you can do for BL is get good grades‚Äù, ‚Äúif you want law review, get good grades‚Äù ‚Äúif you want a federal clerkship, law review then good grades‚Äù and then turn around and say ‚Äúgrades don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù You‚Äôre placating us. We know that. You know that.\n\nAre grades the only important thing in the world? No. Everyone knows someone who got their job or clerkship through networking. And yes C‚Äôs get degrees and people above a certain tier of law school will probably get jobs even at the very bottom of their class. \n\nBut overall, there‚Äôs a reason why grades have been the focus. We are right to be anxious about them. And otherwise, why are we putting in this much work when everyone knows that you can be a great law student and a bad lawyer? Why did I stay up that late? Why did I spend that much of my limited time on this planet building a cohesive but streamlined outline? \n\nAnd the reality is that for some of us, we will do badly and we will feel bad and we will have earned the right to be frustrated about it for a bit. That frustration can and should fuel us to figure it out and do better and become a heartwarming anecdote we tell to potential employers about overcoming academic adversity. It will convince some of us‚Äî perhaps rightfully‚Äî that this isn‚Äôt the profession for us, and maybe we‚Äôd be genuinely happier doing something else instead of taking on a bunch of debt for something that maybe our parents or media or someone convinced us was a good path for us. \n\nAnd conversely, those of us who do well *probably worked really hard* on our school work and we deserve to feel great about it. Saying grades don‚Äôt matter feels a lot like ‚Äúa degree is just a piece of paper‚Äù‚Äî of course it is, but I worked like a dog and sacrificed a lot for that piece of paper to do something good for my family, and cheapening it to make people who don‚Äôt have one feel good isn‚Äôt helping anyone. Some of us need scholarships. Some of us have big dreams and are socially disadvantaged so we need to be amazing to get noticed. These things matter a lot to us. \n\nThere is more realistic and constructive advice that can be given than just denying the material reality. Bouncing back from bad grades is an important story. Re-learning how you learn is an important story. Cultivating discipline is an important story. All of these will probably make you a better lawyer eventually. But flat out feeding to us this nonsense about grades not mattering does nothing but encourage apathy. \n\nSo knock it off.",

        "text": "I go to a t4 school.  I started in the spring semester.  I agreed to a merit scholarship on the condition of a gpa over 3.15 on a 4.3 grade scale after 2 semesters.  \nFor the spring semester, we received grades on a 4.3 scale where the student handbook says the grades are curved to a 3.0-3.2.  We then enter into the fall semester where the handbook states that the scale is now a 4.0 and all grades are curved to a 2.6-2.9.  There was no direct communication about this change that alerted our specific spring class about these changes.  Students, including me, had asked about how these changes would affect the merit scholarship.  They continually said we don't have an answer and only today have sent an email to our class saying we can retain our scholarship either by adhering to the 3.15 gpa requirement or by being in the top 40 percent of the class.   \nIt is hard for me to determine if our class has been wronged in any way because it is not clear how the change of the grade scale and curve affects the average student.... please if anyone has any comments or suggestions feel more than free to share.   Thank you",

        "text": "Hey y'all,\n\nI am now in my second semester 2L year and I'm considering throwing in the towel. I go to an incredibly predatory school in Illinois. They use conditional scholarships (student rank system) and take back 50% of the scholarships they hand out per year. You have to stay in the top 50% to keep your scholarship (mine is half off tuition). \n\nMy best friend committed suicide 3 days before my exams started last semester and, even though I kicked ass in class, my grades clearly took a big hit. All my school offered was pushing my exams back but that did not make sense with the funeral plan (plus studying helped me return to some normality). I fell from the 47th percentile of students (with a 3.24) to the 63rd percentile (with a 3.07). Since I am over 10% away from my student ranking threshold, I cannot appeal to the school to have my scholarship returned. And they do not give a shit about extraordinary circumstances; I know two students who lost relatives/parents during finals and still did not get their scholarships back even though they're some of the most active and involved students. \n\nBut the toxicity doesn't stop there. I have had students bully me, tell lies to the administration to hamper me, and have had the administration believe them! We barely have enough teachers, our advisers are quitting left and right and the only ones we have left are drowning, and we have very few bar prep classes. We have THREE deans, all of whom will not give us any clarity on the scholarship process and two of the three are essentially just bullies. \n\nNow, I have self-esteem issues but I am certain that I'm smart and hardworking enough to make it through. But it's just... do I want to anymore? Do I really want to keep giving money to this predatory school? Pay to work? Be under crippling debt? I feel like I'm falling to the \"sunk cost fallacy\" here. \n\nOh and every young lawyer I talk to seems to fucking hate their lives. Does this profession have redeeming qualities? Or should I just cut my losses and quit? Has anyone had a similar experience? \n\nIs there any supervising agency I can report my school to? I'm at the point where I have a ton of correspondence between other students and the administration showing their predatory nature and lack of care for student well-being. I kinda just want to organize it into a neat document and contact all media outlets with the tons of evidence I have just to put pressure on the school. Yeah, it's a long shot, but I'm sure liberal Chicago would love a story of how one of its \"most diverse and inclusive\" schools is actually stealing money back from most of its students. Even if it doesn't do much, if I can convince just one person to avoid this school, then it was worth it.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a 1L at a T20 and before law school I was a biglaw paralegal for 2 years. I found having to bill all my time to be a great way to keep myself on task. If it was noon and I'd only billed 1.2 hours, I knew I had to get it together and actually get to work. So I used a billing program to \"bill\" all of my time for 1L fall. A graph of the time is below: (note I didn't log any hours actually spent in class).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nfhezyqemfba1.png?width=1627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=828e68258aec3a39eef7295e25185ae7759cc784\n\nI thought people might be interested in the results. I took 3 doctrinal courses and legal writing. Intro to law was a class only during orientation week. Grades below (on a 3.3. curve):\n\nCivpro: A\n\nContracts: A-\n\nTorts: B+\n\nLegal Writing: B+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Studying\" is almost all reviewing finished outlines and taking practice exams, as well as some office hours meetings. Almost all studying was done in the last few weeks of the semester. CivPro \"Notes and Outlining\" is much longer than other classes because our professor did not allow computers, so I took in-class notes by hand and then transferred them to OneNote after each class. Total hours for the semester were 383. I found this a useful way of keeping myself on track and plan on tracking my time again this semester. Thanks for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m94hxl1hmfba1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9671509ba20b6da32790124052447d5b2200eaba",

        "text": "I‚Äôve been published a few times and have a steady content writing gig plus an agent interested in my novel-in-progress. It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. Why am I still thinking about law school? Why am I studying for the LSATs and reading the Boston University Law Review in my spare time?\n\nI‚Äôm a very creative person and I have always worried I don‚Äôt have the logical, left-brain qualities to succeed in law, so it was never my first choice. I also struggled with my mental health for a while and dropped out of college as a result, so the idea of being a capable, respectable academic is new to me. I worked a service job before I went back to school and finished college with a 4.0 GPA. I didn‚Äôt really expect I could succeed as a writer after graduating, but I took my shot and I‚Äôm doing well.\n\nI‚Äôm happy with my career ‚Äî for the first time in my life, my job doesn‚Äôt stress me out. I know being a lawyer would probably be stressful ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even know if I would like being a lawyer. But I still have it in my head that if I make enough money as a writer, I can afford to go to law school. I like learning, I‚Äôm interested in law, and I feel law is a good field to make a difference in the world.\n\nI feel silly for thinking about doing something else when I‚Äôm just starting to succeed as a writer, though. I wouldn‚Äôt seriously consider law school until after I finish my novel and save some money up. But am I crazy for having this law school dream? I don‚Äôt even know what type of law I want to specialize in. Is that something most people know before law school?\n\nDid anyone here go to law school after another career? Any writers-turned-lawyers? I‚Äôm interested in law, but will that translate to enjoying being a lawyer?\n\nFeel free to tell me to stop daydreaming if that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doing.",
