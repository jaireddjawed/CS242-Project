I'm stuck not knowing how to google this. I've found [this](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/254) but am not sure it's the same problem I'm experiencing.\n\nI'm trying to have a Raspberry Pi 3 send data over I2C to an Arduino Uno in 5 byte bursts. I'm using [mikem's library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html) for the Raspi and the Wire library for the Arduino.\n\nFor some reason, sometimes these five-byte bursts don't seem to register: I'll get read events on my Arduino but zero bytes will be available. Stumped, I decided to hook the whole setup up to a scope and found that the problem seems to be that sometimes, mid-burst, the transmission will just stop, leaving the data line low ([here's a photo of the scope when this happens](https://i.imgur.com/Mt0n9rm.jpg)).\n\nWhen this happens, the problem may persist for several of these bursts until finally it seems to \"catch\" and then it'll be fine again for a while, only to pop up later.\n\nBeing a n00b, is there an easy way for me to debug if the problem is the Raspi or the Arduino without buying a new one of each? Is it likely to be my code, a library or a hardware problem as described in the link above? I can try and make a small PoC if people want. But honestly I'm not really looking for an answer (which would be great!) as much as pointers on how to figure this out myself.\n\nThanks for any input!",

The dilemma right now is that I really am not loving the computer eng stuff and I am not as good in it anyway (maybe due to my lack of interest, but I have always performed better, like near the top of class, in most of my signals and comm eng classes with as much or less effort than put into comp eng), but job prospect is rosier for computer eng than signals/comm.

To specialize as in to abandon taking a signal or comm class or two to take another class relevant to comp eng (well rn I'm looking at digital vlsi).\n\nAlso, how useful/feasible is taking a class in real analysis for an ee? \nWhat are some of your biggest regrets related to ECE in your undergrad (i.e. things you wish you have done)?\nBtw if you are going to suggest that I join some student engineering project teams in my school to gain some hands-on experience related to my field of interest, I have to let you know that I actually can't cuz I was rejected (the teams are not walk-ons and get your hands-dirty-right-away type  here: you have to apply and interview and I unfortunately didn't get on any that I applied to :/ ).

The project brings together three fundamental stages of electronic circuit development: preliminary design, verification and refinement by simulation as well as building and testing a prototype. Topics include: review of basic BJT, MOSFET and Op-Amp circuits; computer-aided design (tools and principles); differential and multistage amplifiers; non-ideal characteristics of Op-Amps; output stages and power amplifiers; review of different Op-Amp types; frequency response of linear circuits and systems; feedback principles and applications; signal generation and waveform shaping; filter design principles; other analog circuits (data converters, multipliers, etc.); noise in integrated circuits; and grounding, coupling and decoupling techniques.\"*\n\n\n**Digital Electronics**: *\"The objective of this subject is for students to design, build and test hardware for an embedded application that utilises a modern digital integrated circuit, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a microcontroller or a digital signal processor (DSP). It draws together many elements of engineering – system specification, design, implementation, testing, documentation and management – all in the context of a modern digital electronic system. This subject presents the theoertical and practical basis for the structure, operation and design of embedded systems with an in-depth treatment of modern hardware components. The integrated circuits introduced are field programmable gate arrays, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, embedded PCs; memory subsystems; I/O subsystems; serial I/O subsystems; and some analog subsystems. Modern computer-aided hardware design software is used extensively. Topics such as PCB manufacturing, surface-mount technology and EMC compliance are also treated in depth.\"*",

What I don't understand is how the halfword instruction is loaded.\n\n    SVC_Handler PROC\n        EXPORT SVC_Handler\n        CPSID I\n        PUSH {r4-r8, lr}\n\n        MRS r7, psp\n        LDR r8,[r7, #24] ; gets SVC instruction address from PC\n        LDRH r8,[r8, #-2] ;How come it's -2?\n        BIC r8,r8,#0xFF00\n        ....\n\nFrom what I've read, ARM is little endian by default, so the least significant byte of an instruction should be in the lowest byte of an address. My book also says that PC in the stack points to the last instruction before entering the handler, which is the SVC instruction. I understand that the instruction is 16 bits in Thumb, but if the instruction starts at PC, then why is the address subtracted by 2 in the LDHR instruction? Wouldn't that get the instruction before SVC? Here's how I'm visualizing it:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/IhwR5B9\n\nEdit: So I got an answer from someone and apparently before entering the SVC_Handler, PC updates with PC+2. The book seems to be wrong that PC still points to the SVC instruction. I'm still not clear if ARM Cortex M4 creates cushion to word align instructions, but the -2 in LDRH makes a lot more sense this way. Thanks. ",

        "text": "I am trying to understand a BGR design along with it's start up circuit in Razavi's book. Below is the schematic. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/C3vjX\n\n\nOn the left is the BGR and on the right is the modification to ensure start up and desired circuit operation. Now Razavi says that if the voltages at nodes X and Y are zero then the transistors Ma and Mb are off and consequently M3 and M4 are off. I had 2 questions here\n\n\n\n1) The first has to do with understanding the circuit operations when Vx and Vy are at zero volts. When the 2 nodes are at zero the 2 transistors Ma and Mb are off.  This means that no current flows through Md as the node at P is at VDD. Consequently the gates of Mc and Md are also at VDD which means they are off. This means the output of the diff. pair is at VDD and M3, M4 are off as a result.\n\nNow since VP is at VDD it turns the diode connected transistor on which forces VX high turning Ma on. Meanwhile lowering voltage at VP turns Mc and Md , M3 and M4 and eventually Mb on. When Vp becomes lower than the threshold voltage of Me the start up turns off. \n\nAm I right when I describe the circuit operation above?\n\n2) If I am right above then my second question is with the op-amp expression vout = Av (Vy - Vx) where Av is the open loop gain. If Vx = Vy = 0 then vout is zero. Shouldn't this drive the gates of M3 and M4 to zero and turn them on? \n\nsorry for the wall of text. ",

Chapter 5.1 gives some equations for the jX in series and jB in parallel.  \nPlugging and chugging gives me a B = -0.00176, 0.0115 since it's a quadratic I'm solving for and X = gives really big numbers that I think aren't right.\n\n* How do I confirm that my calculations are correct with a smith chart\n* What's the significance of the Pmax,out value?\n* The book makes a reference to L-circuit being feasible for frequencies up to 1GHz but the assignment mentions using the lumped element model.

I also don't know where the hell I'm going to be in the next couple years so I though I would just hold off on the MS for now. Now that I have worked here for a year (very large company), I want to leave and find a new job. I am not liking this place and feel like my skills aren't properly utilized. I've asked management many times, but they simply don't have much real work for me to do at the moment. I want to work in a job where hardware and software kind of intersect so I think embedded software/firmware will be good for me. Although my resume consists of only projects related to microcontrollers like the STM32F4, LPC1759, and a bit of AVRs, I only got call backs from software jobs (mostly c++ and Java work).\n\nI have had troubles getting firmware jobs prior to working here. I know it's because I either lack professional experience in firmware and/or I don't have an MS. My company doesn't have any firmware work. I'm going to start applying now, but should I also study for the GRE to take the test this winter or should I just wait?  I don't know where I will be ending up in a couple years still. I would prefer that time to review and work on a few embedded projects since I'm kind of rusty at the moment. \n\nIdeally, I want the company to pay for it which is why I want to wait for a company that I want to stay for more than 3 years. I'm unsure if it's worth paying for myself if a company doesn't pay for it. According to my teacher, he feels that and MS is not worth it unless I find a company that will pay for it, and I should have the necessary skills to get the job. But I have my doubts... I wonder if it's still worth pursuing firmware or if I should just move on to applications/web development. Anyway thanks for any help and sorry for long read.\n\n",

I understand that the rods of carbon arc lamps are usually \"struck\" and then moved apart, but it also seems that I don't strictly have to move the rods apart, and since I also plan for this to be disposable in the end, damage and a very very short life is ok.\n\nThe issue: I'm in totally over my head, operating solely based on what I learned in intro college physics, with absolutely no coding ability and the bare minimum electronics knowledge. \n\nDoes anybody have any pointers for how I can go about engineering a LiPo (or alternative) powered carbon arc lamp strobe?",

(Oct 14) and know that I know it works I would love to partner with someone else to put their payload up to 2,000+ft in spring next year. \nHere's some of the limitations I have:\n-must fit in a cylinder 3.75\" wide and 12\" tall\n-must be able to survive and operate at 6 G's\n-must be relatively light. (the lighter it is, the higher it will go)\n-must live in or near Utah. (The launch site coordinates are 40°13'07.6\"N 112°14'46.2\"W) OR be willing to work over email and ship the payload to Utah. It would be shipped back after launch and you can do what you want with the data/results.\n\nI will mention that this is going to be completely free (unless you plan to ship your payload then your cost would be shipping) and that it comes with a slight risk of losing the payload due to the chance of the rocket undergoing \"rapid unplanned disassembly.\"\nAlso some of the conditions are subject to small changes as we get closer to the launch.\n\nI can do multiple payloads if multiple people want to participate. But to give you an idea, it costs me $50+ to launch once so as a college student, I would prefer to launch a maximum of 3 times. \n\nReply below if your interested. Let me know your payload idea, data it will gather and if your local or would like to ship. If I like your idea (or your the only one that replies) I'll PM you and we can work out further details.

Apparently a prospective customer has been inquiring about my circuit and wants a prototype to inspect and test to see if it suits their needs. If they end up liking the circuit they say they would be interested in purchasing a substantial number of these circuits. My boss wants me to get a prototype shipped to them before my work term ends in December.\n\nThe issue with this is I don't have any experiencing with getting prototype boards done. My boss recommended using expresspcb since they have an easy to use software for designing the pcb. But they only do plated through hole mounts for the components. I have a few components in my circuit that do not come in a compatible package. This has lead me to start looking into using EAGLE to design a PCB. But again, as I do not have any experience with this I am unsure if I would have enough time to learn eagle and get a well designed PCB done  by the end of my term.\n\nI think that about sums up the problem. I am unsure if i need to compromise on my circuit and get it done using expresspcb or if I should take a gamble and learn EAGLE to make a real PCB.  \nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\n  ",

Is there a reason for this? I assume if you want to send a large amount of data (uncompressed 1080p60) over USB then having an FPGA that can actually manage that much data is crucial. If I want to send less data, such as 480p60, could I just have a basic transceiver hooked up to a USB 3.0 controller like the cypress ez-usb?\n\nSorry for being brand new and not having a great understanding, I do this as a hobby and finding documentation regarding this specific problem is pretty hard.

        "text": "Here's another post about career path but a little different from others because of my unique background. I'm a working towards a PhD degree in the ECE department but my research is kind of far from ECE. What our lab does is mostly fundamental science, close to physical chemistry or quantum physics. However, I also know a lot of EE stuff, like circuits, EM, and semiconductor devices. I learned them in undergraduate and also took some relevant classes in graduate school, like power electronics. Also in my research we sometimes utilize them as tools but really not very much. Now I'm like one year towards graduation and looking for a job. While doing my graduate research in a physics and chemistry direction I gradually realized that I do not really want to stay in these fields after graduation partly because, well, it's hard to find a job in these areas, partly because now I found something else more interesting to me. I think I really like traditional EE stuff, especially electronic circuits. In my undergraduate or graduate school all the classes about circuits I always got straight A's and I really enjoy learning them. My question is how possible it is for me to switch towards more circuit-related jobs after I graduate? What are the career path options in those areas? I know for sure that I don't like areas like digital circuits, computer architecture, RTL design nor embedded systems.  I like analog circuits or applying analog circuits to real applications. So are the jobs I'm looking for called application engineers, hardware engineers? Should I look into system design? Or analog IC design? There's no doubt that my background is very lacking. I already have the basic undergraduate circuit knowledge like analog circuit or basic op-amps with feedbacks. I learned to design power converters in the power electronics class but did not have real-world experience. I'm reading Sedra Smith's microelectronic circuit book to fill in some gaps. And next semester I can take a analog IC design class. Apparently I still have a lot of time before graduation so I can improve on the parts I lack if I can have a clearer idea about where I'm going. Any evaluation or suggestions? Thanks so much!",

As such, I have determined that I would like to use the PIC to generate my signal, to cut back and save space on the PCB we will be making later on. \n\nI need to generate a 40kHz signal to output to the transmitter and then receive the signal and process it and go from there. My confusion on this comes from the signal generation. My current leading idea is to create a matrix and fill it with values from a loop and basically output the data in place of an actual 'wave'.\n\nDoes anyone have any kind of insight on this? I am kind of in the dark here. I also want to be clear that I am not asking for code or for someone to do my homework. Simply some kind of direction or a good resource you know of would help a lot.",

I know that when it comes to x86 vs ARM, x86 is always preferred for Desktop type computers since they can offer higher performance, and ARM is used for mobile devices due to it not generating as much heating issues. I'm pretty sure there are other issues, but I know that heating is a major issue. Basically you just couldn't run an i7 on a smartphone because it would take too much power, so it would have to be plugged in all the time while using and etc.\n\nSo this is one of the reasons why I was kind of surprised to find out that the Surface tablets run on Intel processors. Then I found out that the surface does have a heat sink built in..... So why can't all other tablets be built like the surface so they can run on x86 processors?",

I've been sending out roughly 20 to 30 applications per week to every single CS, CpE or EE position I can find (internships, entry level, co-ops, defense, private, start-ups, everything). I have a lot of side projects to talk about as I actually really enjoy my field, I've been to many hackathons and have tangible extracurricular experience, but I can't even get an interview anywhere. I know some people are of the opinion that a CpE degree makes you a jack of many trades, master of none, but my school's curriculum requires CpEs to take all the same CS courses as a pure CS major, plus a bunch of EE and physics, so I'm not lacking in any CS fundamentals or anything.\n\n\nI've heard that not getting an interview tends to be a resume problem, so here's mine: https://imgur.com/a/GZDHs\n\n\nAnd my GPA is at a 2.68, so I leave it off. I also worked a supermarket job during my freshman/sophomore years but I've been advised to leave it off in favor of more extracurricular projects. I've been applying to positions all over the U.S. (I'm a U.S. citizen) so pigeonholing one location is not my problem. This has been a pretty depressing experience, any feedback appreciated.\n\nEdit: Specifically on the CS side I've been applying for embedded and applications development, and avoiding web-dev as that's not really something I'm very fond of.",
