        "text": "For folks who don't know, it was Looney Tunes with a modern and mature outlook, The episodes were very grounded and dialogue heavy. I remember coming across it while channel surfing and caught an episode that revolved around Bugs Bunny beefing with his cable service provider for making him miss out on the NBA finals. I was honestly baffled at how relatable that was, coming from fucking Looney Tunes? Whaat. \n\nI later watched more and found out that the whole show was like this, from annoying roommates to awkward dates, and dealing with unemployment, The show asks \"what if these wacky characters actually lived in the real world?\" and it did a marvelous job of answering it. The jokes landed extremely well, and I'm amazed at how not a single one of those iconic characters felt out of place in a modern setting.\n\nReally sad that it got canceled, according to Google, the higher-ups at Warner hated it. But at least we got 50+ episodes out of them. \n\nI just wish this show got the love that it deserves, enough people aren't talking about it. it's up there with Mystery Inc for me as the Gold Standard for slightly mature adaptations of classic kids shows.",

        "text": "Tl;dr: what are the unspoken laws do you need to heed when you‚Äôre making TV?\n\nOne of my favorite ideas is that you need to learn the rules first to break them. You always punch in with a close up at the emotional peak of a scene. Until you make Atlanta. Lines are supposed to be traded off at just the right pace to keep the audience in the flow of what they‚Äôre listening to. Until you make The Meyerowitz Stories. Which isn‚Äôt a TV show but I thought the illustration was more important than the self imposed rules.\n\nI‚Äôm curious as to what you all think the rules of TV are?",

        "text": "I've been [vocal about my love for The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/t5ejua/the_adventures_of_brisco_county_jr_is_a_forgotten/) on this board before, and I know there are other fans of the series. I think a revival is probably out of the question as the show's cult fan base is too small, but Bruce has an idea for a revival.\n\nHere's what he had to say during a [recent interview](https://www.slashfilm.com/1217245/bruce-campbell-on-the-future-of-pizza-poppa-evil-dead-rise-and-his-upcoming-tour-exclusive-interview/):\n\n&gt;\"The Adventures of Brisco County\" is ... you would bring him back following the death of Lord Bowler to find out who killed Lord Bowler, and you have potentially a Brisco son with Dixie that we don't know about, and maybe a Bowler's son that we don't know about, and maybe those guys team up. With me being a successful San Francisco lawyer, maybe he's got to saddle up again at some point. But you'd have to take a new spin on the whole thing, but I'd be all over that like a cheap suit.\"\n\nI think this is a cool idea as family was a core theme of the original series. Bruce has been open about not being able to perform physically taxing roles as much as he used to, but playing a wise old lawyer would suit him at this stage of his career. The original series was also a revenge series that took some strange detours, so Bruce's idea lends itself to that formula too.\n\nIt'll never happening, but it's a nice dream.",

        "text": "Unforgotten on ITV is so great - my favourite British crime drama. It follows a team of detectives who look into historic murder cases. They have to look through old police work and interview suspects from decades ago to crack the case. \n\nEach season is a different mystery. Ie. In season 1, a body of somebody who went missing in the 70s is discovered in a house in London. It follows the detectives, and all of the characters involved in the case in the present - you slowly piece things together throughout the season. \n\nWhere the show really excels are in its performances by Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar. As a viewer, you end up as invested in the detectives as the mysteries. \n\nSeason 5 is currently airing, but it is serialised - you have to start at S1.  \n\nAlso, those of you who have binged S5, what did you think? Spoiler-free. I loved this season, thought the mystery was the most compelling for a while. Sinead Keenan was an excellent addition to the cast.",
