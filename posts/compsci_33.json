        "text": "Some background on what's happening.  Until yesterday, I thought I had scratched the possibility of applying to my school's 5th year Masters program due to some external circumstances, but they were resolved and now I've realized that I have around 9 days to complete essentially my entire masters application, including setting up a research project and getting a teacher to endorse it.  What I've figured so far is that that requirement is the most constraining factor on whether or not I'll be able to complete this application, so I wanted to complete that portion of the app first.\n\nThat being said, I haven't done research before (not a requirement for my school's program since the masters is more academically based than research based) and I don't particularly want to/spend too much time on it either, as I'm trying to do this masters more for the extra time I'll get to take more upper level comp sci courses at my university.\n\nWhat I'm trying to find in my research project is\n\nA) Something that fits in my areas of interest (artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning, data analysis and science, combinatorics and statistics) as well as my areas of interest outside of computer science (not sure if any of these following areas are even valid related areas for a masters cs project, but just in case, areas like game logic and strategies (for like, chess, for example), football/fantasy football, economics and industry/customer relations)\n\nB) Something that would preferably not kill my time next year (not because I don't want to work hard, but more because I'd prefer to spend my time on classes rather than research)\n\nC) Something that wouldn't be so derivative that it would pique a professor's interest and possibly get them to help me out on this extremely, extremely last minute request.\n\nI'm not asking for someone to magically give me a project idea that fits this exactly (though if someone did that would be amazing), but more I guess a direction to go if these are the priorities for my project selection.  As I said, I've never done research before, so selecting a research project at this level is an unknown to me, and I would appreciate any feedback or tips I got.\n\nAlso, I realize that my situation is probably pretty fucked, I'm really determined to try and figure out a way to deliver a completed application by next Friday, and it would help a lot if people who have gone through this process before could give me any tips on how to proceed with this application process, esp. in terms of professor interactions regarding potential research projects.\n\nThanks so much!!  Also, if this is the wrong sub for these type of posts, pls lmk so I can delete it and move it to the correct sub.",

I want to motivate them, not teach a course. So I was thinking I could make some simple projects that would show how powerful the theory is.\n\nI was thinking of starting with automatas and recognizing some patterns in text by handcoding the automata. Then I'd show how you can represent those patterns with regular expressions and show some simple examples of their use in tools like grep and sed. After that, maybe show how automatas and regular expressions are connected, and write a program that would take a regex and some text, turn the regex into an automaton and spit matching lines (a simple version of grep).\n\nAny ideas or critics would be welcome. I am especially struggling with how to introduce context-free languages, since they're so beautiful but also quite a bit more complex than regular ones.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a final year undergraduate in economics and philosophy with no prospect of cross-registering or transferring majors. I've just been accepted to the MSc in Computing Science at Imperial College London, which is a conversion masters course for computing students. I really want to work in AI research in the future as I feel that the field yields the kind of insights I was hoping to find in econ/philo, and would like some hard/honest advice about whether the path I am considering is feasible.\n\nThe kind of questions I am interested in center around the mathematical and algorithmic nature of intelligent cognition - is thinking model-based, i.e. constructed from a recursive update of mental models based on discrepancy between predictions and observed reality, or is thinking model-free? Is thinking/decision-making fruitfully understood as optimising some functions, and if so what kinds of functions? How is it that concept acquisition is possible, and how do agents learn from small/no examples/meagre verbal instructions. How do you get semantics out of lists of the unstructured lists of numbers that form the representational bases for connectionist networks.\n\nI notice that my questions bleed into cognitive science/neuroscience as well. But I'm (a) averse to experimental work on people [building AI is fun for me tho] and (b) more generally interested in the broader question of what intelligence could be rather than how it is realised in humans specifically. But would you guys recommend I just go into cogsci/psych/neuro anyway?\n\nAlso, would doing the imperial conversion course help me become a useful contributor to the field? The first half of the course has your standard C++ programming, computer architecture and Logic programming fare, with the possibility of taking options in probabilistic/statistical computing, machine learning, algos, and AI. I can't do the AI-focussed masters due to lack of background.\nhttp://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/pg-info/mcs/\n\nEspecially since I'm paying international fees for this, I hope to be able to get a decent research engineer job after graduating, and make some money while applying for PhD programs. How probable is it that (i) I can get a research engineer position with the preparation given in the masters; and (ii) get into a semidecent PhD program? How do you think this squares up against first seeking work in some data science related position in energy/finance first, save up some cash, and then do a 2-year mathematics masters in my home country or try to get admitted to a more AI-focussed masters before considering a phd?\n\nAlso, how much raw mathematical ingenuity do you need to make theoretical breakthroughs in this field? I was by no means terrible at maths as a child through hard work I got solid As in a highly competitive East Asian high school exam system, but I didn't really have Olympiad level spark nor a real appreciation for mathematical reasoning and problem solving. I respect maths a lot more now having encountered it through economics, but I still wouldnt say im the brightest math guy even in my econ program, let alone among the armies of brilliant people going into the field.",

I am very passionate about computer science and am completely aware of the importance of Maths in this field. \n\nDespite this, my teachers persuasiveness combined with my crushing imposter syndrome led to me thinking the best decision was to drop maths as it is not an absolute necessity when applying for some Comp Sci courses in the UK.\n\nI am now very keen to establish a mathematical foundation before uni so that I am not at as much of a disadvantage when I begin my course. Are there any particular mathematical concepts that you guys think I should have a grasp of for a comp sci course?\n\n",

So for this purpose, I don't care about what is good performance or good to use in industry... but I'd like it to be easy to learn to use the controller so that I can very quickly get up to speed and start writing SDN programs and learn about the SDN concepts.\n\nI'm not too particularly concerned with what programming language it uses either, unless it's something weird - I just want easy to learn programming models and APIs.\n\n(Being easy to use with mininet and easy to install and configure are also pluses.)\n\nAny suggestions are much appreciated.

Do most financial calculations in Japan just use integers, then? I imagine that makes it a lot faster and more efficient at least on most conventional CPUs. Percents can be translated to rationals which can be done entirely with integer math as well. And the largest useful numbers of currency can easily fit in 64-bit integers.",
