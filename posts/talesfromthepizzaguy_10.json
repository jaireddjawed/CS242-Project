        "text": "Yesterday I was working as an opener which while I was a bit put off since I'm usually a night driver it wasn't the end of the world. I come in at 9:30 to get the store up and running to find that by some freak of nature there are no timed orders that we need to get started on. Cool, I might just be able to get prep done before noon. It's just busy enough to keep my mind from going numb and the 11:00 driver and I manage to get prep done one time at a leisurely pace. This means I get to go to my lunch on schedule and I have time. I clock out and do my usual ritual of hitting the drive through and scarfing down the food while I go through the nearby car-wash I have an unlimited membership at. once the dryer finishes up I park, step away from my car, and re-apply my sunscreen since this isn't the kind of job that gives you cancer treatment copay money. I realize I'm running short on time so I walk briskly back to my car and put my can on sun screen in my center console before hurrying back to work.\n\nI get back on time and get in to find that there's a couple runs for me that just got put in the over. I make myself busy while I'm waiting and then grab my runs. Walking to my car I can't help but notice my windows look as if there's morning dew on them and that it smells like a water park in a 10' radius from my car. I open the door and gag. I forgot to screw the sunscreen cap back to the locked position when I put it in my center console and it tipped over at just the right angle when I exited my car to have the cap fall against the rim of the center console. The entire can had sprayed onto my dashboard and everywhere else while I was inside. Everything looked like It had a layer of wax on it and the smell was so bad I had to leave me doors open while I started my car. I did my runs with all the windows down and joking about the situation with the customers at the door which was fine but on the way back it started to rain. Great, now I'm gagging at overpowering sunscreen smell and I'm gonna be wet since I think I might start to get woozy if I try to shut my windows. At least I wasn't stiffed\n\nAs soon as I got back the 11:00 driver asked my why I smelled so bad. I explained the circumstances to him and he laughed and shouted to the GM \"Hey [GM],  come over here and smell attlas93!\" At first she thought it was drugs but as soon as she came into the back it hit her like a truck. I let them both look at the inside of my car; you could see the lines on my passenger seat where my logbook was. The GM agreed to let me go home as soon as the mid-shifters got in at 4 and I didn't think twice about it. I went straight home and showered until the smell got out. Today I had to take my car to a higher end place in order to get it re-washed and have the interior deep cleaned, so there goes $40 and another bottle of sun screen. C'est la vie.",

        "text": "Context - I was delivering to a hotel [that has a loop like this for parking](https://t-ec.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1024x768/633/63342444.jpg). Cars enter from the right of the picture and pull around so the passenger side faces the main door, if that's understandable.\n\nI was delivering a pizza a few nights ago to a hotel like this where a guy was parked very askew in front of the door, bad enough to where I couldn't go around him if I parked behind him and left before he did. As such, I just pulled in the other way and parked in front of him, ONE because I didn't wanna park behind him and if anyone else were to pull in behind me, it would cause a backup and TWO, I wouldn't be there for long and he could always go around me.\n\nTo my surprise, what I thought was a parked and empty car turned out to be occupied by some obviously drunk guy who looked like Penn Jillette if he were as pale as a goth chick leans across the seat to me and yells out the window \"Hey dipshit, move your car\", to which I say \"I'll only be a second, you can back up or go around if you wanna\", and that got him fuming for whatever reason. He started screaming at me \"HEY FUCKER MOVE YOUR FUCKING CAR\" meanwhile I just wanna get in and do my job of delivering this pizza. He runs inside after me to get a manager to show them how I parked in front of him and in return I tell them how poorly he parked and how he could've just as easily went around.\n\nSo while we're waiting for a manager to show up, he's trying to flex his authority because he's a big dude with muscles and I'm just a scrawny pizza guy who's never been in a fight on the job before and he's all like PUT THE PIZZA DOWN TOUGH GUY LETS FIGHT etc etc and I'm like \"Dude I don't wanna fight chill out boyo\" and he's like WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU CALL ME YOURE JUST A FAGGY PIZZA GUY, and I asked him what I did for a living and he said WHAT DO I DO FOR A LIVING? I'M A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT MOTHERFUCKER and finally by that time, some managers come out to look at the park job and stuff, along with the Senior Vice President's wife and kids.\n\nWe all go outside and listen to the drunk dude's rant on me, which basically consisted of \"THIS PIZZA GUY THINKS HE CAN PARK IN FRONT OF ME WELL FUCK HIM I'M A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT HIS CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A BUMPER\". After his rant, I'm trying to explain what I just explained to you guys in the context/first paragraph while the SVP was yelling obscenities at me and his wife was trying to calm him down. Then the manager there said I'm parked fine and the SVP could just go around me. This made the SVP fucking HEATED. He got red in the face and started yelling at the dude OH YEAH WELL I'M A HILTON GARDEN MEMBER I DONT CARE YOURE STILL GONNA CLEAN UP ALL THE SHIT IN MY ROOM and the manager was like \"Nope I'm evicting you off our property for disorderly conduct\". This made him even ANGRIER. He got all up in my face and the managers face, calling us faggots and berating us for working in the service industry. I told him I smelled alcohol on his breath and he was like OH YEAH MOTHERFUCKER MY STEPMOM DIED SO WHAT I HAD A FEW DRINKS FUCK YOU. All this while his poor wife was moving his car for him. Then the cops showed up and detained him and I forgot I had to deliver a pizza. So after he was yanked off the property and I gave my statement to the police I went back to work delivering pizzas after a round of applause for the working class.\n\nSorry I worded it really shittily and shit, it's just hard to explain and every time I think back to it I get heated. I kinda wanna find out which company he's a senior vice president for and be like \"Yoo your senior vice president is an alcoholic bully, fire him and make him deliver pizzas for a living\", but that's a bit excessive. I feel bad for the wives and kids though, seeing them through this whole thing made me think of my mother's alcoholism and the effect it had on my family. I honestly hope that the wife and kids leave him because if they don't, it's just gonna be one long road and his kids will probably end up having to deliver pizzas because the only influence they had was their dad being buttmad over parking.\n\n\nTL;dr just let people do their jobs.",

        "text": "Hospitals suck. You guys know it all. The buildings are huge, the nurses and doctors who ordered are always busy and make you stand around, the doors lock after a certain time and you have to enter through the ER and take a convoluted path to the main building, and they somehow always manage to order 10 minutes before closing.\n\nI work for a pizza place that may or may not have a large chain of easily identifiable buildings that have been sold off to other businesses. Customer Service Center comps pizzas all the time and never gives us any say over it. Oh, and we close at 1am.\n\nWell after a particularly long and busy day we get an order for a single Stuffed Crust that was discounted to $0 for some reason or another. Sure enough it's headed to the hospital and we're 15 minutes from closing, but heres the kicker. We are completely out of SC, hand tossed, and thins. We tried to call the customer multiple times but kept gettijng a disconnected number. Oh well, manager calls the CSC and gets it voided and we get back to work mopping and whatnot.\n\nFlash forward to about 1:30 am and just as we're about to leave the particularly irate customer calls asking about their free pizza. Manager tells her we're closed and she'd have to call CSC again to get her pizza at a later date. Which she does. And also CSC calls us once again and essentially tells my manager we have to make the pizza and deliver it due to her ordering it before closing times. This is rather unusual but I guess something about the meal being comped affected how things were handled. I dunno.\n\nWell it's now 2 am and I'm rolling up to the Hospital extremely pissed off and just wanting to drop off the pizza and head home (perks of it being free.) I'll be M, proxy customer is PC, and real customer is D (for Dr.)\n\nM: hello! I'm just looking for D and I'll be on my way.\n\nNice Desk Lady: Hold on let me call PC.\n\n(5 minutes of waiting in a sucky hospital.)\n\nPC: I'm here to sign for it.\n\nM: No worries, it's all handled and free. Just take the pizza and we're good.\n\nPC: But I'm supposed to give you a tip.\n\nM: Ma'am I honestly don't care, I'd just like to head home.\n\nPC: Hold on while I call D.\n\nM: ...\n\nPC: Ok follow me.\n\nM: *fuck*\n\n(~10 minutes of walking from the ER to the 4th floor, I hate hospitals)\n\nD: Ok let me sign for that.\n\nM: There's nothing to sign.\n\nD: What?\n\nM: It's free, discounted, no card information at all. I literally can't get a tip unless it's cash.\n\nPC: I don't have any cash.\n\nD: I don't either.\n\nM: Seriously I don't mind, I'm just trying to go home.\n\nD: Well I can't not tip you. Let me ask around.\n\n(5 minutes of standing as Dr asked a few nurses for cash)\n\nM: No really, I-\n\nD: Hold on let me check with the other station. \n\nM: Ok. Seriously, I'm putting this pizza right here and leaving. I got off the clock over an hour ago and i really just want to go home. Have a good night.\n\nD: Uh...ok\n\n(~10 more minutes of walking, did I mention I hate hospitals?)\n\nI got home at 3:15 am instead of a normalish 1:30. God I hate delivering to hospitals.",

        "text": "AGM here. I close quite often, so I get the majority of the most ridiculous customers. Tuesday is normally slow night for my store and tonight was no different. \nLet me regale you with two of our most interesting customers we had tonight. \n\nCustomer #1: Regular customer, comes in and orders once or twice a week for at least the past two years. Normally, no problem, he orders, gets his pizza and goes. I’d like to point out he usually comes in on our 50% off for a specific employer night, but he comes in other nights as well. Up until about year ago, it was on Tuesdays and is now on Mondays.  In the past 6 months, I personally have reiterated that it changed at least every other week if he comes in on the wrong night, so he knows which day he can get 50% off. \nTonight, this customer comes in and raises hell after being told his total. He says we charge him different prices depending on who rings him up. My chain is not a cheap one, and yes, a large 5 topping pizza is going to cost you approximately $20. On the 50% night, its going to cost less. I was pretty sure this was an easily understood concept, until this customer spent 15 minutes debating with 3 separate employees including myself. Sigh. \n\nCustomer #2: \nNew customer, has never ordered from us. A driver answers her call and asks me if we can distribute toppings across pizzas differently than a customer orders them to save money. I’m thoroughly confused, No, we have to charge them according to what they ordered. 10 minutes later, he’s still on the phone with this customer. Finally, I get on the phone with this lady. \n\nCustomer- “Yes, I’m trying to order your 3 Large with 2 Toppings each for 27.99 online, but when I put my order in, its charging me like $35. I don’t understand why and your system is wrong” \n\nDuring their call, the driver had rung up the order as the customer was trying to order it to compare the price for her, so I confirmed what I was looking at on the screen was correct. \n\nMe-“Well ma’am, I see you have two cheese pizzas and then we have this third pizza with 6 toppings on it. The additional charge is because the coupon you’re using only allows up to 2 toppings per pizza for that price” \n\nGet ready for this, ya’ll. \n\nC-“Well if I’m paying for 6 toppings across 3 pizzas, why can’t I just put all the toppings on one pizza? You’re a small store, you can’t just run over there and tell your people to make it that way?” \n\n*facepalm* \nWe have a huge store, (by pizza store standards, we have a dine in area for some reason) and this is a national pizza chain. It doesn’t work like that. \n\nMe-“Ma’am, that’s not how the coupon works. Each pizza is allowed between 0-2 toppings. Anything over that is an additional charge.” \n\nC-“So you’re trying to make me pay for my toppings twice?” \n\nI just couldn’t at that point and luckily, she hung up on me before I could attempt to explain once again. \n\n\n\nThank goodness I am off for a glorious full two back to back days. I’m going to avoid all people. ",

        "text": "We're a small store, in a small town, so we don't get a lot of scammers. When we do, everyone in the store gets told the story, because it's just that unusual! We're lucky in that sense.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the assistant manager (AM) got a call from an angry customer, asking where his pizza was. He'd ordered over an hour ago! Our AM looks up his name and phone number but can't find an order under either. She puts him on hold while she calls the store the next town over. It's not uncommon that people accidentally place an online delivery or carry out order at the wrong store. Except the store the town over doesn't have it either. When the AM informs the customer of this, he huffs and asks if he can place an order over the phone now with her. She says of course. At the end of taking his order, she reads the price to him. He gets all indigent, and tells her, \"This should be free since this is your fault my order didn't get placed!\" At first she fights him, asking how it's her fault an online order didn't get put into the system, but he's so insistent, to get him off the phone, she gives in. Of course he didn't tip me! We put it behind us.\n\nLast night I take a call. Same situation. His order can't be found. I put a new one in for him. He says to me when I read him the total, \"Won't this be free since it's your fault?\" The moment he says that, I remember the situation with the AM and immediately get my GM. The GM tears this guy apart, politely. \n\n\"No, sir, it will not be free.\"\n-\n\"Because it's not our fault.\"\n-\n\"It would be free if we had done something wrong, but we haven't.\"\n-\n\"I'm sorry sir, that will be $X.XX and it will be there in 25 minutes.\"\n\nThe minute she gets off the phone she looks at me as says, \"I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you. You're the only one I can trust to not get pushed over by this guy.\" All our other drivers are new or meek, unfortunately, so I accept the task, expecting a shitty attitude and a shitty tip.\n\nI get there on time with the customer's food. He opens the door, I greet him and state the price he owes immediately. He has the gall to say, \"Um, the manager said it would be free.\"\n\nMy blood boils. This. asshole. I give him my best smile, \"Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I wasn't informed. Store policy dictates I need to call and confirm that with my manager. Let me do that and I'll be right back.\"\n\nHe back pedals immediately, mutters, \"Uh, no, that's okay, I'll pay.\"\n\n\"Oh! Sure thing, sir!\" I wind up getting a small tip, miraculously, because he doesn't have the balls to ask me for exact change. He wound up being a total wimp in person, which is hilarious considering the outrage he was able to display over the phone.\n\nI go back, report the whole thing to the manager, she pins his name and number to the board and directs everyone to never give this dude free food ever again. And she asked us to confirm he's really a local college student since we give them 20% off all orders, by asking to see his ID next time he orders carry out or delivery.  He lived nowhere close to the college, and while still possible, almost all the college students are from out of town and thus live on campus. So if he ever has the guts to order again, his history of getting free/discounted food is over.\n\nScammers never prosper long.",

        "text": "I had two notable customers tonight. One made me laugh and the other one pissed me off.\n\n\nFirst customer asked how many slices can we cut a large pizza into? I said, I can go 16 if you want,  but 12 is a little more common. He asked how many they're normally cut into and I replied, \"Normally, we cut them into 8 slices.\"\n\n\nGuy thinks for a second and says, \"Yeah, you better just do the normal eight then. I don't think I could eat 12 slices, let alone 16!\"\n\n\n... Yes, he was completely serious :-)\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nSecond customer is a scamming liar of a woman that we have had an ongoing problem with for months. About four months ago, when I first moved to the store from another area, called and she name-dropped the GM and said that we messed up her last pizza and she was supposed to receive a new one today. It already sounded fishy because we don't notate accounts with free pizzas, we mail certificates that are carry out only. \n\n\nBut, she mentioned the GM and rather than make a deal of it or try to verify anything, I just sent her a free one-topping pizza. Then I find out from my shift lead that he did the same exact thing 4 days prior, and three weeks prior to that.\n\n\n*\"That fuckin bitch...\"*\n\n\nThe problem is, she blocks her number and gives us a different telephone number every time, and sometimes even a different apartment number, but I was able to note most of the so-called accounts that she has, that She is a scammer and to Not give her any free pizza. \n\n\nTonight she called again 7 minutes before I close asking if I had spoken with the GM and could she get her free pizza to make up for our last \"mistake.\" I tried to be nice, I tried to play it straight, told her that I could do a carry out but that delivery was no longer available because it was so late. Would you like to place an order? And she just wasn't getting it, kept asking for her free pizza, name dropping the GM like that supposed to impress me, saying the certificate must be lost in the mail, and GM *assured* her that she could just call for her free pizza and finally, I just had it.\n\n\nI said, \"You know what? I'm not doing this again. I tried to be nice, but you're making me Not be nice and I don't appreciate it. I know exactly who you are, I know exactly what you're trying to do. Do you really think we don't talk to each other here? You don't think I have notes on every single one of your so-called phone numbers and your address? I know for a fact that we have given you free pizza in the past, undeservedly. I know you're trying to scam me for free pizza. And it's not going to work. Everyone here knows exactly who you are and you will never get another free pizza from us. If you want to be a normal customer and place a normal order, we will do a carry out for you but we will never deliver to you again and and you will never get another free pizza from this store.\"\n\n\nAnd then I went a step further.\n\n\n\"In fact, the last time you tried to pull this, I shut you down politely but I did not give you a free pizza. Right after that phone call, I called every single pizza store in this area. Mominoes and Mapa Mohns Already knew everything about you and they also will not deliver to you anymore. All the other stores were grateful for the information and you will not be scamming *them* either.\"\n\n\nShe tried to Huff and be indignant and asked me for a toll free number that she could call to report me. I told her, \"No, there's only our store number and three guesses who's going to answer it if you call? Like I said, you are welcome to come in and do a carry-out order like a normal customer but other than that, we are done here. Thank you, Have a good night.\" Click.\n\n\nI then texted both my GM and my ops manager that if a complaint came through about me, I would be *Very* happy to give them **All** the details :-)\n\n\nSometimes you just gotta fire the customer.",

That is usually sufficient for gas because the majority of the assholes that don’t tip live under a mile from the store so we see it as “at least I get $1”. The longer runs are typically to people that tip properly. So it evens out enough (not that stiffers are any less awful). \n\nOur mileage rate is going to be based off of what we drive so I don’t know my rate yet. Someone threw out 30¢ and I don’t know if that was what they were told based on their car or they just pulled it from thin air. But if it’s close, going to the stiffers will now result in ~45¢ instead of $1. I fear riots when we all refuse to go to those places! Of course going to one edge of our territory that we hate going to would now be ~$4 so that’s nice. Perhaps it will again even out?\n\nSo if your store switched from a per delivery rate to a mileage rate, was it a good change or a bad one?",

I don't often carry cash - but I felt like the driver should get something since, you know, gas. My dessert item showed up and I offered the driver the tip, saying I was sorry and knew it wasn't much. The driver refused the tip, saying it was okay.

She still declined. \n\n\nDoes it do them any good for me to leave a FB message or something to compliment the store for fixing things so quick and politely? Is there any way that my mentioning the driver waving off a tip can come back and bite her?",

So I pulled up the app and selected the store, only to be told online ordering was not available. I clicked the link to call them instead, and was greeted with a wonderfully cheerful yet incredibly frazzled woman who informed me their entire computer system was down, but they were still taking orders by hand. I ordered my pies, and continued on to the location.\n\nWhen I got there, it was chaos. Even the register systems weren't working, so they were taking everything by cash, and calculating everything on Post-it notes. Every computer screen in the place has some kind of HP Thin Client boot screen on it, indicating no connectivity to their central system.\n\nEveryone was scrambling around frantically trying to make pizzas, track orders, and take money. I sympathized with the crew, tossed out a few jokes to get a smile or two out of the poor souls, paid my fee, and left.\n\nMy condolences and praise for that hardy crew.

I'll try to keep it short. \n\n\nI'm an assistant manager for the store I'm at. \n\n\nI was working on something on the computer for the store while my boss, the store manager, was grabbing dough from a neighboring store. A call gets through to me at my computer station. For simplicity, I'll be M, customer will be RC (for rude customer; a man, which will be important later), my boss will be B, and my insider will be O.\n\n\n--\n\nM: Thank you for choosing $pizzaStore, I'm NotSoGrownUp, how can I help you?\n\n\nRC: HOW MUCH ARE YOUR WINGS?? \n\n\nM: An 8 piece is about $7.00.\n\n\nRC: NO I NEED 20!!\n\n\nM: ... Umm... We have a 14 piece for $11.00\n\n\nRC: OK. Fine, I'll get that then. Can you deliver those wings?? \n\n\nM: Of course. I just need an address. \n\n\nRC: 1234 Street Ln. I want to add a medium pizza. Is there any specials for that?! \n\n\nM: I'm not sure, let me check.... Mmm... No, only for our eight piece and a pizza. \n\n\nRC: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! \n\n\nM: Mmm.... Nope, afraid not. I'm sorry, sir. \n\n\nRC: WELL THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS!! I WANT MY FUCKING WINGS SENT TO 1234 STREET LN!! THAT'S SO FUCKING STUPID!! I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THAT--\n\n\nAt this point I hung up on him. I'm not about to send a driver to this guy. I quickly add a note into the customer profile that he has harassed me and to be extremely cautious when answering his call. \n\n---\n\nForty minutes later, my boss was still out and I'm still working on my project on the computer. A call gets sent to my station; same number as before. \n\n\n\nM: Thank you for choosing $pizzaStore, I'm NotSoGrownUp, how can I help you?\n\n\nRC: OH FUCK NO!! I NEED YOUR FUCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER!! YOU DON'T FUCKING HANG UP ON A FUCKING CUSTOMER!! \n\n\nM: Sir, I only hung up on you because you were cursing at me for not having a special on our 14 piece wings. \n\n\nRC: OH MY GOD! I WASN'T FUCKING CURSING AT YOU AND I'M GOING TO HAVE YOUR FUCKING JOB YOU FUCKING--\n\n\nAt this point I hung up on him again and went back to my project. \n\n\nAs soon as my boss came back, I let him know what had transpired. He told me that he supported hanging up with belligerent assholes and that if a customer care case came from the office, he'll handle it. \n\n\n----\n\n\nA few hours later, we were in full swing dinner rush. My boss was on the cut table/dispatch station handling business and I was jumping between stations that needed help. All of the sudden I hear my insider from the main order taking station having issues with a phone call and go over to investigate.\n\n\n\nO: I'm sorry sir, but you don't have to curse at me.\n\n (pause) \n\nO: Would you like to talk to my manager on the situation?\n\n (pause) \n\nO: Sir cursing at me won't... No... Sir?\n\n (pause) \n\nO: Sir... I understand. No.\n\n\n\nAt this point he hung up and yelled to the other insiders not to put the 14 piece chicken in. He looked visually upset and I asked him what happened.\n\n\nO: He just started yelling at me saying how he's fucking disappointed with our fucking store and how he wants his fucking wings delivered to fucking 1234 Street Ln.\n\n\n I've realized it was the same guy from before!\n\n\nM: Hey boss!! That guy that cursed at me just called!! The wings guy!\n\n\nB: Oh yeah??\n\n\nHe walks over to the order station and looks at the profile.\n\n\nB: This guy?\n\n\nM: Yeah, he just yelled at O.\n\n\nB: OK.\n\n\nMy boss picked up the phone and called the number on screen.\n\n\nB: Hi, this is $boss, from $pizzastore, I'm sorry MA'AM, but you're not allowed to order from us anymore.\n\n\nThen my boss hung up the phone laughing and quickly added, \"NO SERVICE\" into the customer profile. \n\n\nM: Boss, that was a man.\n\n\nB: I know. And he was so mad.\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR: Brilliant boss blacklisted belligerent bastard. \n\nEdit: Retouched TL;DR. Courtesy of /u/velocibadgery",

        "text": "This happened a couple nights ago, thought I would share with you all.\n\nSo I'm taking a delivery to a pretty rich part of town, as I approach the house I see a woman pacing back and forth about a block away from my destination. It was odd enough to draw my attention, but I quickly drove by and forgot about it. After I finish the delivery and start to drive back, I notice that she's still there, but now she's stopped pacing and is standing still and looking towards me. As I'm about to make a left turn to get back on the main road, she kind of waves at me and starts to approach the car. At this point I'm thinking she just needs directions or something, so I roll down the passenger window and say hello. She looks a bit anxious or uncomfortable even and says \n\n\"Hi Pizza guy, oh sorry [Pizza Place] guy, I was wondering if you could--and you don't have to--and I can pay you--\"\n\nI still have no idea what she wants, so I interrupt and ask \"How can I help you\". She ends up saying that she was supposed to go a funeral but didn't think she could handle being there, but when she saw me she was sure it was a sign and had to at least ask. I know where the funeral home that she was referring to is, and it wouldn't take me out of my way, plus we weren't that busy that night so I agreed. She gets in the passenger side, the floor of which is littered with old receipts and random garbage from the other drivers who use the car. I apologize for the mess, the only thing that's been on that seat was the hot bag, but she doesn't mind. The funeral home is about 7 minutes away I'd say, so we take off. I ask who's funeral it is, and she says it's her fathers, and my heart instantly sinks, it was awful to hear. She said that she had a speech prepared and everything but was going to have her aunt(?) read it because she didn't think she could handle being there in the front row, her dad was her hero. He was only 75, and pretty big icon in that town and for a certain MLB team. She thanks me profusely and is adamant about giving me money. I told her is was very unnecessary and that I was happy to do it. But she insisted, and after asking me if I was student, she was even more determined to repay in some way. (She ended up putting $50 in the cup holder when I wasn't looking, best tip of the night) I told her I'm studying Kinesiology, and she was kinda startled because I believe that's what her father studied too. We talked about physiotherapy, doctors, and many other subjects along the way. One thing that stood out to me was that she on several occasions mention that my parents must be so proud of me, not knowing how to respond I just kinda of smirked, nodded and agreed, but looking back at it now, maybe she kept saying it because that is something she needed to hear there and then too. \n\nWhen we got to funeral place, she thanked me profusely once more and told me that she was going to call my manager and tell him how amazing I was for doing this, but I immediately crushed that idea because I honestly don't think we're allowed to have anyone else in the with us, liability and what not. We talked for a little bit longer in the parked car and she began to tear up, it was a very emotional and human experience I must say. She got out of the car, thanked my again, I wished her luck and told her everything is going to be okay and drove off. \n\nTL;DR: Woman didn't think she could emotionally handle going to her fathers funeral, but decided to ask me for a ride. I agreed and we had a good talk on the way there.",

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nAs the title suggests I'm from germany and as we have rules about what the lowest possible salary is, tips are usually not requested as (in theory) everyone should be able to make a loving with the governmental regulated minimum income. It's still polite to tip, but most servers don't get to keep it or will split it between all employees, so you usually tip something around 10%.\n\nWe have a few big websites where you can order pizza online and directly pay for it, but there's no option to add a tip. So I was wondering if there are any german (or any other country that doesn't rely on tips) pizza delivery guys in here who could maybe answer some questions (yeah, it probably depends on your workplace):\n* Do you get to keep tips you get? \n* Would you expect anyone who pays online to have a few bucks lying around and to be able to tip you with cash?\n* Do you get the \"Mindestlohn\" or do you rely on tips?\n* Are maybe some tips already included in your delivery fee?",

        "text": "Venting... \nSo I was delivering to a trailer park after dark. Pulled up to the shit hole, got out of my truck and noticed that the inside door on their corrugated shack was open, and the screen door was closed. I walk up and hear a dog barking, no biggie. But I then realize that the dog is only a few feet in front of me. I'm talking to the dog, showing that I'm nice and friendly. He's a medium sized dog. My best guess is that it's an Akita or a Chow mix. As soon as he gets close enough to me, he bit me on the outside of my left leg just underneath my knee. Ripped my jeans, left 3 puncture wounds, a hematoma and one little part needed glue sutures.\n\nI had OC spray on me, but also carry a pistol. I was honestly ready to shoot the dog, and pulled my pistol out to shoot it, not even thinking of the OC spray. The owner sticks his head out of the door and said I was at the back door and should've came around to the front. (Like I'm supposed to know which door you consider to be front and which you consider to be back.) So, I know it got me, but as I'm talking to him, I see that my jeans are ripped. So as he's filling out the receipt, I pull up my pant leg, and then confirmed to him that his bitch ass dog bit me.\n\nHe doesn't say a word. Doesn't even pretend to care.\nWhatever. Fuck you and your dog.\nI take the next delivery that was in my truck and then I get back to the store, tell my manager, and tell her I'm going to the ER. This didn't sit very well with her, probably because I was the only driver left because I was closing. Told her tough shit, I'm still going.\nI called 911 and made a report. Dispatch said they'll have to respond as it is a high priority call. So, I do the decent thing and call the guy and tell him what I'm doing, and that cops might show up. He goes off on a tangent about how I should've paid attention to the dog and known where he was and that I should've came to the right door. I counter that by telling him that if you invite a delivery driver to your house, you should have enough fucking brains to put your dog up, and that I had every legal right to be there.\nI honestly don't know how things will go or what will happen, but I wouldn't have been such a dick about it if he would've at least said that he was sorry or offered me something to stop the bleeding. He pretended like it didn't happen. Because of his reaction to what happened, I'm seriously wondering if I can take things any farther regarding this incident.\nAny of y'all had an issue come up such as this?\n\ntl;dr Bit by a customers dog, he didn't care, and now I want him to inconvenience him as much as possible.\n",

When I order food for DELIVERY I want it DELIVERED to me. I don't want to get a phone call where someone says that I have to come get my food because they can't bring it to me - I tip you for bringing it to me. \n\nMy apartment building isn't huge and complicated, you pull in front of the building and walk up 5 stairs and my apartment is first on the right. If I lived in a large complex with a gate or something I'd have no problem coming down to meet someone for my food because I understand you have other orders to get to but this is a pretty simple delivery. \n\nTo top it off he explains the receipt tip lines and whatnot and stares at you while you write the amount in which I find rude as well. \n\nSo is this a normal thing? Have you worked with people who have injuries and have limitations such as not being able to lift a certain amount, go up stairs, etc? How do delivery places usually handle this? In the little notes section of my order should I write \"stairs needed to reach residence\"? \n\nThanks in advance guys! ",

So after telling her I didn't understand how I'd get out any time close to my scheduled out time I just said \"whatever I guess I'll just leave the dishes up here for now\".\n\nShe tells me that she will take the dishes back eventually and then 9 pm and I'm back from some deliveries. Dishes still haven't been brought back and my scheduled time is already passed. So I ask if I can take the dishes back...considering I now know I'm never going to get out anywhere close to when I'm scheduled. \n\nShe replies as if annoyed and says \"take those dishes back...but don't take the cups and make line back yet\". Basically preventing me from completing the dishes I'm supposed to do as my deployment. \n\nAt this point I was quite furious...my job is to do the late night dishes and 30 minutes over my shift i can't even take my remaining dishes back to start on them. So I text the GM and explain to her my dilemma. \n\nI explained that I was scheduled till 9 and even though I expected to work at least an hour over just from experience, I'd at least like to finish my late night dishes and not be at the store until close doing dishes.\n\nWhen I got back from my delivery, the manager who wouldn't let me do the dishes immediately says \"go ahead and clock out!\". I ask if she'd like me to finish the make line and cups, and she hatefully spouts out \"I told you, you weren't doing those!\", trying to turn it around like I was the one at fault. At this point I was done arguing about this whole thing. Obviously my GM must have messaged the manager about it and pissed her off. In retaliation she basically told me to leave and whoever the closing driver that night was, got stuck with the dishes that I wasn't allowed to finish. I clocked out and went home.\n\n2 days later and my shifts were all modified. I don't have my closing shifts anymore...In other words I'm being punished for trying to get my dishes done on time. \n\ni already understand as late and closing drivers, we literally never get out on time...but when I'm attempting to do the job I've done for 2 years without an issue in order to get out of work...the situation is clear. Obviously the manager was understaffed and trying to keep me until close by disallowing me to finish my scheduled deployment!\n\nCan HR do anything about this? This manager has already received a complaint from another employee who quit and cited her for a hostile work environment if that makes a difference...",

As I'm sure you know it can be annoying to deliver to retail stores since often you have to wait for the orderer (orderee?) to finish helping customers. I went up to the service desk as instructed on the receipt and one of the ladies said \"oh i'll take that over here.\" \n\nAlas it wasn't the orderee herself, just a co-worker that wasn't busy helping a customer.  I hand her the receipts and she starts to fill it out then asks her busy co-worker \"did you want to leave a tip?\"\n\n\"Just leave something nice\" she responds.\n\nI never look at the tips when someone hands me back the receipt, I just thank them regardless and go on my way. When I get back to the car [I see this](http://puu.sh/zeKQE/b57833ff9b.jpg) \n\nSure, that's something nice, but life coaching tidbits don't pay the bills m'am. I was pretty steamed but laughing at the same time. The dollar sign tickled me the most. When I got back to the store my manager told me the orderee had called back and added a $5 tip explaining her co-working didn't understand her vague instructions. I'd call that happy ending.\n\nDon't forget to $love yourself everyone.",

        "text": "I work with a local food delivery company in a small city, within a big county. We deliver food all across the county from local restaurants to customers who order online through our website or app. \n\nOne day I had to deliver to a guy that ordered from downtown, where 80% of the places we deliver from are located. I look at the ticket: 11 miles from the restaurant, **no CC tip**. However we have an automated distance fee that adds $1 after every extra mile. I still got paid decently. \n\nI arrive at the house and ring his doorbell, no answer. I knock again and ring his doorbell, no answer. 5 minutes later, same thing, no answer. I keep trying the front door because this dude has a dog that was barking its head off at the entrance of the carport. \n\nI called the customers cell phone that was provided on the ticket, and I could hear it ringing inside the house. While it was ringing, I put my face against the window next to his front door, and I could see his phone through the blinds laying on the living room table: no one was around. Couldn’t visually see anyone, didn’t hear any footsteps after the ringing stopped. Nothing. \n\n#Great.\n\nThe dog had left the car port by this point, so I go into his carport and knock on the door there. The very first knock of my knuckles on the door pushes the door forwards. **The door was cracked open.** Now I’m thinking to myself: “Is this MF dead? Was he killed? Is he just asleep? Did he overdose? WTF is up!”\n\nI peep my head through the cracked open door, look to my right first, and there is his living room. All messy, with a pet iguana and a snake in separate glass containers. *What am I getting myself into*, I thought. Then I look to my left, there is the kitchen. The sink. The fridge. The table. A screen door. And... a pair of legs and a penis. [Not the kind of tip I was expecting.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/HoYp1cA)\n\nThis guy was butt ass naked sun tanning on a lawn chair in his back yard, listening to music with ear phones in, **knowing he ordered delivery an hour ago...** \n\n#Cum on bro...\n\nI kept knocking on the carport door, watching him with my peripheral vision because I couldn’t look at this naked fool. He **still** couldn’t hear my knocks. So I pushed the door open, and slammed it shut. **Finally.** He recognizes I’m at the door turned sideways, and puts on a towel. \n\nHe walks up to the door, and takes the food. “Thanks man, sorry I was listening to music.” “No problem, have a good one.” \n\nI quietly laughed the whole way back to my car, and messaged my dispatcher about what just happened. *Thankfully*, I haven’t had to driver to this address again.

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo during my time working for father jonathon, I was first introduced to the joys of weed.  (Pizza delivery and weed kind of go hand in hand don't you think?)  While many people tried to tip me with weed (and usually succeded) one story stands out in my mind.  The one time I accidentally gave a customer a pre-rolled blunt.\n\nMy manager was a pretty chill guy, he got his work done but wasn't afraid to have fun and let us have fun either.  I can remember loads of times that he would tell me that there was something in the shed he needed my help carrying inside the store.  When i would make my way out to the shed, he'd be waiting there with a lit blunt and we would smoke it together.  It's important to note that while i could roll a mean joint at that point in time, I wasn't even able to roll a shitty looking blunt.  My manager, however, could roll a cuban cigar looking blunt.  To this day, i have never seen a prettier blunt than the ones he rolled.  \nSo, I asked him on this particular day while we were smoking if he could use my stash to roll me a blunt (because i had no papers for a joint) and he obliged. See, my plan was to wait until i got through the checkpoint and onto the base before i lit up.  (this was a common occurance with me and wasn't really anything new)  This day though..... oooooh this day.... \n\nSo Fort Fill-in-the-blank was literally right across the street from our store (you could walk to the checkpoint in about 30 seconds from our store) and i had this fat blunt just sitting in my center console.  I pull out of the store and start making my way up the (semi-steep) hill.  The hill was just steep enough that you couldn't really see the checkpoint from our store, so i had no way of knowing what i was getting myself into until it was much too late.\n\nI pulled up to the gate and lo' and behold, they were doing random car searches with drug dogs and there i am with this fat blunt in my truck.  Oh well, they don't search everyone and i'm pretty sure they won't ask me to pull into the searching lane because i quite obviously have a car topper on.  Booooy was I wrong.  They motioned me over into that lane. \n\nI'll be honest folks, at this point my butthole was puckering so much at this point, im sure that a piece of my seat was missing.  I was terrified.  I only had ONE idea of how to get out of this mess, so i slowely reached into my center console and grabbed the blunt.  (there were like 3 people ahead of me) I very gingerly, not drawing any unneccary attention to myself, pulled the box of pizza out of the bag.  I opened it and slid the blunt inside with the pizza, closed the box, and put everything back the way I had it.  \nI really hoped it would work, but i pretty much assumed i was going to go to jail at this point.  I was pretty much resigned to it.  I pulled my truck into the search area, put it in park and killed the engine.  As I stepped out of the truck, the Military Police were opening my passenger door and bringing the search dog near.  \n\nOf course, the dog immedietly hit the scent and started barking at the pizza box.  [MFW](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=HWo99isa&amp;id=5D383B26041590B6E307769F983313E04A7456CD&amp;thid=OIP.HWo99isagsJk_9kravegEgHaFj&amp;mediaurl=http%3a%2f%2f4.bp.blogspot.com%2f-9hPfn7uK5XI%2fUS-E1meBkII%2fAAAAAAAAB64%2fjgsfErc8MNA%2fs320%2foh%2bno%2bface.png&amp;exph=194&amp;expw=259&amp;q=oh+no+face&amp;simid=608020062343466078&amp;selectedIndex=7) The cop, surprisingly, just said \"oh, he smells your pizza and wants some of it.\"\n\nGuys.... Now i KNOW these dogs are trained way better than that.  So please don't hit me with that logic.  I KNOW already.  To this day i don't know why he let me go without searching my truck, but he did.  I can only guess that either he was feeling lazy that day, or he was giving me a break because i worked for a living, I don't know exactly what the deal was, but regardless, he let me go and i wasn't about to question his motives.\n\nI got back in my truck and pulled onto the base and started driving towards my delivery street.  I was so worked up about what had just happened that i decided I was already high enough and i wasn't going to light up just yet.  I don't remember exactly why, but for some reason i had to pull over and call the customer. (this is important later) Most likely, it was for directions to thier address or something, but regardless... I had to call the customer before i showed up.\n\nSo yeah.  I showed up at the customers house and delivered my pizza as usual and started heading back to the store.  By this time I had calmed down a little, so i reached for the...... wait..... where did............. [NO!](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=wYyYNhIK&amp;id=93AF5CD7B378C410558AA428DA9ECF751EF34F1D&amp;thid=OIP.wYyYNhIKIMsbUYrtcjefLwHaFs&amp;mediaurl=http%3a%2f%2ffc03.deviantart.net%2ffs71%2ff%2f2012%2f222%2f1%2f6%2fdoctor_who_oh_shit_face_by_justcallmejash-d5amr17.png&amp;exph=202&amp;expw=263&amp;q=oh+shit+face&amp;simid=608045879401119933&amp;selectedIndex=1)  So... you guys remember where I stashed it right? yeaaaaah. I done goofed didn't I?\n\nJust then, my phone rang... can you guess who it was? Yeah... the customer was calling me back.\n\n\"Hey man, I just wanted to let you know you left this blunt in my pizza do you want to come back and get it?\"  \n\nI was just like \"nope, you can have it!\"\n\nThen he just starts laughing.\n\n\"Well GOOD! Because my wife and I are already smoking it!\"  More laughing.\n\n*click*\n\nSo yeah, I hope you enjoyed hearing about the time I almost got arrested AND delivered weed instead of pizza.\n\nTL;DR:  I wanted to get high, the dog wanted to eat my pie, and my customer was a pretty cool guy.\n\nEdit: Hey! Thanks for the gold! I had a comment gilded once, but This is the first **post** I've ever had gilded and I appreciate that you liked it enough to spend real money on it.  It's an honor :)",

After delivering the first one, I was descending the stairs which go down the side of the building with my bag tucked under my left arm.  There is no railing on the right and a rusty railing with chipped paint on the left.  About halfway down I slipped, likely on a worn/chipped end of the tread and tipped forward, landing on my stomach on the stairs and sliding down face first.  I can only assume I flung out my right arm to stop myself because it is scratched and strained.  \n\nI hit the concrete at the bottom of the flight with my face, jamming my glasses into the bridge of my nose/forehead and taking out a chunk of skin about down to the bone, and scrambling up the skin on my upper lip.  I also had roadrash on my forehead above the big gash and on my nose and chin.  It bled so much I ruined my uniform hat trying to staunch it until I could get back to my car where I had paper towels to use as a makeshift bandage and my phone.  \n\nI still have blood all over the side of my car where I bled profusely getting paper towels and my phone.  Called the store and my mom.  The store sent someone out to collect my bank/money and mom took me to the emergency room.\n\nNow I have glue and stitches in 2 places in my face and I will probably need plastic surgery to correct the massive scars I'm gonna have on my face.

When she is focused she is decent but she has forgotten to turn the make line twice in one month.   \n\nThe GM constantly shows up late sometimes only a couple minutes but yesterday over an hour forcing the opening manager to stay an hour late when they had somewhere they needed to be. He also lets his favorites get away with the same damn thing.  We have a girl who calls off for half her shifts and still works there and another who is constantly 15 minutes late if she shows up at all.\n\nHe often forgets to order the truck and the soda truck.

Now we have swung the opposite way where we are actually overstocked and without room to put everything away properly.\n\nAll I want is to come in do my job and go home.

I didn't actually experience it first hand. \n\n\nSo, a guy comes back in the store shortly after picking up his pizza and claims that there was a bug in his pizza. He even showed my manager and sure enough there was. I've been at this store for the past 2 years and a bug in food, or anything of that nature, has never happened so it's safe to say we were shocked. As all of you know, if something like this happens its common for a customer to freak out, want to speak to a manger, demand free food, threaten to call corporate, etc. But not this dude, if I remember correctly I was told he said something along the lines of, \"hey I just wanted to let you guys know I have a bug in my pizza. I like ordering from you guys and don't want anything bad to happen to this store so I thought you should know.\" This guy didn't ask for a single thing. No credit, no remake, nothing. He kept the pizza and just picked out the bug. Suffice to say when I was told about this I was shocked and also grateful that this accident happened to someone cool and understanding like him and not some asshole. Don't get me wrong though, I believe that if someone finds a bug or anything like that in their food that they should get a remake no questions asked and probably a future credit as well. It was just crazy to me that this customer asked for nothing. Pretty cool guy. ",

On the online form there's a \"have any suggestions\" box where you can place requests such as \"ring buzzer\" etc. I decided to play a joke on Ma and put \"It's my birthday, can you please sing Happy Birthday to me upon delivery?\" in the box.\n\n As we were getting to the house, the pizza girl showed up. My plan was going to backfire fast. Ma says \"It's not my birthday, but my son-in-laws is soon.\" And she pointed right. At. Me. \n\nNeedless to say I had my phone out, turned on the camera and hit record. I'll have to find the video and upload it, but I thank you Pizza People for doing the crazy shit us regular people ask you to do in those requests.",

        "text": "# The Types Of Pizza Slingers! \n\nSo there’s a few types of *pizza slingers* in the pizza delivery game, I’m gonna break it down for everybody that doesn’t know. First you got the lazy motherfucker who is fast on the roads but doesn’t lift a finger to help with the store work, then you got the guy who busts his ass in the store but is super slow on the road, both are pretty useful employees.\n\nYou got the dude that’s on drugs, usually heroin nowadays although speedy drugs users are always in the food industry as well, these guys or gals are either looking to get clean or looking to make cash everyday to party and if the druggy is not delivering pizzas they are making the pizza instead, he is usually in the bathroom sniffing up pebbles on the floor by the end of the night.\n\n\nNext you got the young kid fresh out of school, he usually has no idea what work is because he still has mom doing his laundry and has a brand new car which was most likely his graduation present, this person doesn’t have to pay bills and has not learned the responsibilities as a adult yet, don’t expect much from them.\n\n\nYou got the person with the new car that cost more than what their making in three years, this person is always complaining how broke they are because they have a huge car payment every month. Then you have the guy with the car that’s barely running who somehow manages to keep it running with things he learned from MacGyver. You have the veteran who knows all the streets and all the houses by color and lawn furniture, and you have the guy that still uses his gps to find the same apartment building that orders nine times a day. Next you got the hot chick, the medium chick and the ugly chick all of which want to get someone’s pepperoni sausage.\n\n\nYou usually have a quiet person, they don’t interact with fellow employees but it might be because they are a LGBQT community member, and sometimes you would not be able to tell if it’s a boy or a girl unless someone tells you. There was one of those not too long ago at my shop and for about a year no one had any idea that *he* was a *she* until someone spilled the *sauce*...though the surprise is priceless when somebody cracks the code of the transgender at work, especially when it turns out to be somebody that you couldn’t tell was a woman or a man, when you find out you feel as if you’ve been fooled, you feel like something cheated you. Now to break down a couple more, the veteran driver, he’s the one that’s going to make the most money every night, he doesn’t necessarily have to have the brand new car or the shitty car, he’s the one that was born to sling pizza and his customer service skills are impeccable, his delivery knowledge is priceless, he knows what to say to customers to make them tip well, and he knows what to say to employees or managers to get what he wants, he is the ***Delivery Master***.\n\n\nYou dont come across many black americanized people delivering pizza, for what reason I don’t know? You do come across some other ethnicities, people from other parts of the world and sometimes people from other parts of the America, usually white or hispanic people. The people that deliver pizza are usually pretty weird, as far as the owners they are capitalist crooks that believe in minimum wage salaries, they will never help you advance in life because it will cost them money. Usually all the managers are underpaid, overworked, and fed up with life. Nothing is worse than a scumbag skeezy motherfucker for a manger/boss who has this mentality - nothing but money matters and that’s all that matters, strictly business, strictly big capitalism, every olive counts, every gram of cheese matters, every single piece of pepperoni is money, don’t let them catch you eating a couple pineapples from the huge 10 pound bucket of pineapple, because food cost matters, and to him/her (usually woman are not as greedy) that piece of green pepper equals $0.00032 cents and after 37 years that adds up to be $41.00 worth of food cost down the drain!! They will bitch at you and give you the breakdown then you’ll see him pull off in a brand new Porsche or $60,000 SUV. But you have to respect the hustle because it allows you to have a job and people like that are unfortunately needed in this country at this time.\n\n\nThe customers also have stereotypes, some of them are - the moron that doesn’t tip, he could be black, chinese, or middle eastern, the thing about assuming tips on the race, it’s not always true sometimes you get a tip from a person who you wouldn’t expect a tip from like the mom with three kids who is probably dirt poor and still willing to give a pizza delivery driver $5 bux, that shit makes me tear up when it happens because you will go to some of the nicest condos in the city and get maybe a $1.20 from some trust-fund bachelor living in a penthouse with not a worry in the world. Sometimes you will get a customer who has never tipped you, all of a sudden bust out a $10 dollar tip. \n\n\nYou will come across all types of pizza eaters, college kids ordering a salami and sausage BBQ pizza at 3 am because they are cramming for finals, or the guy who feels it is appropriate to answer the door in his pee stained undies, the sneaky 13 year old kid who pockets the change that his parents told him to tip you with, he just keeps the money and that’s how he gets comic books or bath salts or whatever, there is the fat girl who orders a salad with 3 blue cheese dressings and a diet coke, which to me is a joke because why would you order salad from a pizza place????\n\n\nI see a lot of different situations like bringing 29 extras cheese and pineapple pizzas up 4 flights of stairs and the order might be $470 dollars and the person will scribble a signature and try and not to tip you thats when you bust out the *hey sorry but can you just fill this out properly, with a total price, you dont have to add gratuity but if you do it is always appreciated and it helps keep drivers driving* those people are the worst. \n\nYou might have the drunk weekend warrior who orders a bunch of shit and ends up passing out drunk, when you get to the house they don’t answer the door or phone, that's the most annoying, and you have the idiots that order pizzas, they tell you to call when you get there and their phone is on silent, so you call a 100 times and get no answer which leaves you to bring the food back to the store and then they call up asking where’s my food?? \n\n## Anyways this is my pizza delivery rant for today and as usual I will be slinging cheese pizzas around the city of Providence tonight looking for a good story to write about. I plan on escaping pizza slinging city someday and hopefully someday soon!!\n\n**If you have anything to add to this please reply, I always look forward to hearing from fellow pizza pushers.**",

        "text": "Back in high school &amp; college, I used to deliver pizza...so I know how the job can be sometimes.  That experience always made me appreciate the pizza guy from the customer's side of the story.\n\nWhile I don't drink anymore...I used to drink....*a lot*.\n\nAs I'm sure you guys know...the chain pizza places who deliver late are often the last bastion for food for drunks.\n\nI prefer to tip in cash so the delivery person doesn't have to mess around with cashing out credit tips...but honestly....when you're shithouse drunk, you're not really planning ahead for those kinds of details.  On the occasions when I would order without having enough tip-cash on me....I would always bump up the tip amount on the credit tip.  At least....I *hope* I always bumped it up...because when I was ordering pizza at 1am, you can be sure I was near blackout drunk.  To their credit....even if I did screw up sometimes, they were always polite and never gave me any attitude.\n\nTowards the end of my drinking career, one particular incident stands out for me.  Apparently I had ordered a larger than usual order close to the time where they cut off delivery.  Being the heavy drinker I was...I passed out and never answered the door.\n\nThe next morning (who am I kidding, it was probably late afternoon before I was coherent again) I saw on my phone that I had ordered pizza.  Now, this wasn't uncommon....many times I would wake up with a hangover and find the trail of empty boxes, pizza crusts, &amp; dropped toppings that drunk me had left for myself the night before....not remembering I had ordered.  But this particular night there was no garbage trail...no pizza boxes in the trash....nothing.\n\nI decided to drove over to the pizza place that evening to apologize for the inconvenience.  I had just written off the charge as my tax for being a drunk &amp; passing out.  Feeling pretty embarrassed, I explained who I was and what had happened....leaving out the \"I was blackout drunk\" part and just said \"I must have fallen asleep\".  I'm *sure* they knew the truth...as I had been ordering from them for years....and their drivers have seen me in varying degrees of fucked-upedness...but again, they were very polite and never said a thing about me being a drunken mess.\n\nI asked if the guy who was delivering that night was working the same night...and they said yeah, but he's out on a delivery right now.  I left $10 for him for wasting his time &amp; gas.  I hope he got it.  As I was leaving they said \"We cancelled the charge for the order, so don;t worry about your credit card.\"\n\nWhich, I thought was *extremely* generous of them.  It was my fuckup and they would have been 100% in the right to keep the charge.\n\nI don't drink anymore...and now when I have pizza delivered I make sure to always have enough tip cash on hand before I order.\n\nI know it's a thankless job and I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who not only do the job, but do it pleasantly and professionally under some pretty shitty circumstances at times....and thanks for treating me nicely even when I probably could barely speak.",

        "text": "So this one happened to me yesterday.\n\nI had a big order, 10 pizzas, going to the athletics building on campus in the college town I deliver in. I called the customer before leaving the store to arrange a place to meet (parking lot out back). So I pull into the parking lot and a bunch of college guys are walking through the lot. A bunch of them yell, \"Pizza! Pizza guy! Wooo!\" They're waving at me, saying it's theirs. Now I can't go a week without at least one asshat making the joke that the food is theirs when it isn't, so I ignore them. I park by the back door to the building and call the customer. \"Hey, I'm back here by the door.\"  \n\"Could you bring it around to our bus? Some of my players were trying to flag you down.\"  \n\"Oh, sure.\"  \nSo I get back in the car, and pull my car around to the bus. The customer asks why I didn't just come over when the students tried to wave me down. I explained the situation how people think it's funny to flag down the pizza guy when it's not their food and it happens all the time, so I didn't believe them.\n\nWasn't a big deal. No harm, no foul. I guess I'm just sharing to share, but seven hells do I wish people would stop using that \"joke.\"",

        "text": "  TL;DR: Crazy lady ordered food and got abducted by aliens. Me and my father tried delivering her food, but she was on planet Gazorpazorp. Aliens returned her because she was a cunt bag and called me demanding her food, saying she's been waiting too long and lied about being home the whole time. \n  I actually delivered for a Cuban restaurant, not pizza, but I thought this was fitting. \n  This summer, me and my dad worked as delivery drivers for his friend's Cuban restaurant. Great food. Great atmosphere. It wasn't super fancy or super cheap, but you could easily spend $20 a person and add in that I live in an area where everyone understands how to tip nicely (even for pizza. Who woulda thought?), me and my dad made some nice cash. Because my dad was friends with the owner and the owner gave no shits, there was a strong \"anything goes\" philosophy. But onto the story. \n   One day, my dad covered the first hour of my shift for whatever reason. I meet him to grab the orders in his car and he gives me the heads up that he just tried delivering to an apartment and the person was not there. Or asleep. Or dead. He didn't know. \n   Her building is one that makes you sign in with a guard and they buzz you into a lobby. Then you have to be buzzed up the elevator by the person you are visiting. My dad had called two mins before he got there and there was no answer  My dad signed in and tried to buzz up the elevator. No luck, so he tried calling her, again. . No answer. Call again. No answer. So he goes to the guard and the guard buzzes him into the elevator. My dad knocks. No answer. My dad goes back downstairs and the guard actually calls her house phone. No answer. My dad calls one last time and leaves. \n  I take the two orders my dad gave me and then the bartender calls me to say we have more orders and I relay the story in case this lady calls. He tells me to go back and try one last time (her food was probably cold, but the owner didn't care because he doesn't put up with customers like this), so I head back and repeat the same damn process my dad went through. \n  Keep in mind, this is an hour after the original hand-off. I bring the food back to the restaurant and go about my business for about a half hour. I then get a text from a number I didn't recognize asking where the lady's food is and why hasn't it been delivered. It was worded in a way that made it seem like it was a coworker texting me. \n  I didn't have time earlier in my shift to save the new bartender's cell number in my phone, so I thought it was him texting me because he had previously called me about new orders. I told him I brought it back and gave it to the owner. I then get a phone call from the number and it's the fucking crazy lady screaming at me about how she never got her food.     \n  This bitch pretended to work at the restaurant when she texted me (because she had her number from my failed attempts at reaching her) and proceeded to chew my ass out, saying she's been sitting in her living room for an hour and a half waiting and I'm awful at my job. She also called me some really colorful and racist insults (probably assumed everyone working for the restaurant was Hispanic because it's a Cuban place)\n  Lol no. \n  I politely explain to her that I am a white female,  both me and my father tried delivering to her and the sign in log can prove it. She said she didn't have a sign in log in her building and lives at 123 dumbass street.  \n  Yup that's where I went. I have pictures of the sign in log. \n  After some more yelling, I told her something along the lines of \n\n\"I am going to hang up now. If you want your food, please call the restaurant and they may or may not remake it for you after I tell them what you just said and how you have treated me. I can also guarantee that they will make you pick up your food. Have a nice night\"\n\n  I called the owner and let him know what happened (he called her a stupid cunt and was not happy about her racist remarks) and to this day, that lady never got her food, didn't even issue a chargeback, request a refund, call and complain, or even write a review. \n  \n  Ironically, later that night, I had a customer not answer their phone or door because they were taking dabs in the living room, with the window open, right next to the door and was high af. When I redelivered their food, they paid in change and threw it at me and called me a bitch for not leaving his food on the porch. \n  Idk",

        "text": "I'm trying to keep my mind off of some things today so reddit is a good place to do that.  I've got a couple red flags that stand out from my years as a driver back when i still did that.\n\nI delivered in a medium sized city, and the store I was at had a HUGE delivery area.  It included rich, middle class, working poor, college students, and straight up projects.  We did have a few places we wouldn't deliver to, but our manager basically had a policy that so long as a place didn't give us any trouble we'd go there.  If anyone made drivers uncomfortable he'd ban the complex.  Our customers fortunately knew this.  Corporate policy was that we weren't to carry weapons, but the manager was supportive and understanding that we might need to protect ourselves.  Some drivers carried pepper spray, one had a collapsible baton, and a few of us had firearms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a daytime delivery to the back of one of our projects.  Nobody had any problems there ever except the lack of tips(and even then there were a few good customers there) so I didn't think much of it and went on my way.  Got to the address, and the doorway was on the backside so I walked around with the pies and there were two men standing there talking, one with a gun in his hand.  He didn't see me immediately, so I started backing up and casually reaching into my pocket holster-- and then he noticed me and turned and started raising his gun.  Half a second into it he saw I was the pizza guy and immediately shoved the gun into his pocket.  And the quote, verbatim, he gave me was \"Shit, (n-word), I thought you was the police. I almost put my pistol on you.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI obviously wasn't happy and kept backing up.  He said \"Naw man, I don't let anyone here mess with the pizza guy.  Sorry for scaring you.  What was you reaching for?\"  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI told him my phone, and he laughed because he knew I was full of shit.  He offered to buy my gun, and I politely declined.  He tipped me eight bucks on a fifteen dollar order.  Turned out he was super nice(to me, at least).  I thought about reporting it to the cops, but opted not to because he knew who I was and also where I worked so if it did come back it wasn't worth it to me.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a coworker who delivered to a hotel one time.  Some foreign guy answered the door shirtless.  Coworker noticed two people hiding under the covers in the room.  I guess the guy noticed his interest and went and lifted up the covers.  There were two girls, bruised and naked.  The guy offered him a go at them in exchange for money(and it wasn't a large amount).  My coworker reported it anonymously, and I guess it panned out because he got a reward from the hotline.",

        "text": "  What do you guys do when people tell you to come in to their house to \"set the pizza down on the table\" or if a delivery specifies you to go into the house because its an elderly or disabled customer?\nThe other day i had a delivery that had a note to go into the house to meet the guy because he was disabled and couldn't walk. So he was just waiting on his living room couch. The guy was nice guy and the delivery went fine and all but last thing i want is to get murdered or have something  bad happen, plus i don't deliver to the nicest areas... that was the first time i went into someones house and am not too keen on doing it again. I know i could just tell my manager I'm not comfortable doing it and have him take care of it.\n\n  My question to you guys is, do you guys go into peoples houses when asked? If not what do you do about it? ",

        "text": "I work at a Pizza Hut in SoCal and have been here for about 8 months. When I was hired I was told that drivers make $1.10 per delivery and that it would fluctuate with gas prices. Once gas started going up I immediately started asking about an increase and was always told “soon”. Eventually drivers were told that starting December 1st we would be getting paid per mile and everyone had to sign something. It was pushed back to the January 1st and now they have no plan of changing to a pay per mile (also they didn’t tell anyone they changed their mind) It wouldn’t be a big deal, but tips for my store have gotten awful due to the delivery fee going up a $1 since I’ve been there and now there’s a 60 cent service fee. When a customer sees they’re paying an extra $5 for a delivery they either assume it’s including the tip or don’t wanna tip due to how much it has already cost Coworkers who have been there for years say the delivery reimbursement hasn’t gone up while the delivery fee has doubled. Does anyone have advice on how to approach management about increasing the per delivery compensation?",
