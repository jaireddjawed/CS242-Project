I told him that maybe there a a collection of other games that feature them and we may not know about it, i he jokingly claimed that he doubt its, gamers have no interest in playing as some black dude compared to other races and ethnicities because they don't find them interesting, a lot of games are from japan and he says they don't really like black people there and gamers in the west would you rather play as badass warrior with blonde flowing hair in medieval europe, or some generic black dude from the suburbs but he says he wishes their was an alternative for them to be in more interesting settings than some no name NPC. What are you guys opinions do think there a lack black lead characters or games are just as fine as it is.",

        "text": "I can't tell you how many games I've played where the first few hours were brutally hard to get going due to lack of resources and skills, then once you make it a little ways in you gain healing/revive capability, or have enough money to basically keep the machine of an army going, or get a cool move that you can spam to get through most situations. Your character gets stronger faster than the enemies do, and the game just keeps getting easier and easier until the end.\n\nI understand this, from a narrative perspective. It does make sense to feel like you're going from a clumsy, awkward loser to a capable journeyman and finally a badass, but from a gameplay perspective it's all wrong. Games should be gentle and easy to start (and *not* just literally for five minutes in the tutorial) and then slowly sawtooth the difficulty up. You can do this while still keeping the sense of progression; you just need to keep introducing larger and larger threats. Maybe you're a civilian and you start by just fighting other random nobodies who can barely fight back. Then you have to fight soldiers. Then wild animals. Then demons start appearing. Then finally massive, legendary supernatural entities. At each stage you could have a mini feeling of \"Wow, those guys were hard, but now I can take them down no problem.\"\n\nNote that this doesn't necessarily make a game bad. I love every one of the games I'm about to list as having this problem.\n\n**Series that feature examples of the problem:** Dragon Quest, Metroid, Zelda, X-Com, Divinity, Megaman\n\n**Series that have better difficulty progression:** Disgaea, Fire Emblem, Mario, SMT/Persona",

        "author": "Riekopo",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8zya9n/il2_sturmovik_battle_of_stalingrad_now_has_a/",
        "text": "If you go to the Steam [store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/307960/IL2_Sturmovik_Battle_of_Stalingrad/) for IL2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad you will see that it now has an overall and recent review score of 'Mixed'. \n\nThis is an immediate and direct result of the developer 1C Game Studios (1CGS) suddenly and without any warning mass deleting/revoking the Steam keys of thousands of their customers. \n\nMy personal experience with this is the following: Yesterday I emailed the developer on their [official website](https://il2sturmovik.com/) to ask them if they could update my email address on my account. The reason being, I no longer use the old email and there is no way for the account holder to do it themselves which is strange to begin with.\n\nSoon after I sent that request, I got two messages from Steam that popped up onto my screen. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/czOevVg.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/iKaEdEw.jpg). I assumed that something got screwed up with my account during the email address changeover and replied to 1CGS trying to ascertain what had happened.\n\nHowever, they simply did not respond to my question. They asked for screenshots of my Steam keys and purchase proof. Which I provided and then they went silent. As I became furious over the apparent theft of my games which I paid over $41 for I started searching for answers on the Steam store [discussion page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/307960/discussions/), the [official forum](https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/forum/9-general-discussion/), and the various IL2 Sturmovik [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/il2sturmovik/).\n\nI soon realized that this was not a simple screwup with my account, but an intentional theft of what seems like thousands of keys from thousands of their loyal customers. Many of which have spent much more than $41 on their quite expensive game and DLC packs.\n\nThe developer has only made two (unprofessional)posts about this event. One on their [official forum](https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/topic/37982-do-not-buy-from-greyblack-market-websites/) and the other on the Steam store discussion page. They are locking all the threads about it on their forum and appear to be trying to sweep the entire thing under the rug. \n\nTheir justification for what in my opinion amounts to an unethical mass theft of customer money and violation of their consumer rights is that these keys were sold second hand \"grey market\" websites. \n\nI for one knew nothing about this grey market thing until now. And I'm absolutely positive many others also did not. When I bought my copy of the game in April I simply Googled it to find the best price and bought it accordingly. It's not clear or explained how the developers expect the average customer to know that they are only allowed to buy their IL2 Sturmovik game keys on a certain couple websites and no others. And if they do buy it from the wrong website their money can be effectively stolen at any time by the developer, which has probably been $100+ for some people considering how expensive the game is.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some people are even saying that their Steam-bought keys have been deleted. I am beyond disappointed with this developer. They are being greedy and spiteful and irrational. I would like to know how they think deleting the keys of thousands of their customers will create any positive outcome. Surely they don't expect these people to buy their expensive game and DLC all over again after their money was just effectively stolen.  \n\nI for one will never be buying another IL2 Sturmovik game and this is coming from someone who has been playing the series since the original and has invested a lot of money into HOTAS setups. I feel compelled to make official complaints with Consumer Affairs, the BBB, the FTC, the State AG, Steam support and the like.\n\nApparently Ubisoft did something like this recently and then walked it back and reversed course and restored the keys after public outcry. Let's hope 1CGS does the right thing and returns the thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars worth of keys they've taken from their loyal fans.",

        "text": "So, I picked up Sonic Mania Plus this week - and found it fell into a problem that rears its head every so often, in that it makes a terrible first impression. Note that very mild spoilers lay ahead.\n\nSonic Mania's Encore mode kicks off on Angel Island from Sonic 3. One of the more iconic Sonic levels, and I was seriously excited to see it get the Mania revamp treatment. Then, I realised it was literally a 1:1 copy of the first act, up to the mid-way point. No new mechanics, no new routes, not even any updated assets - all pulled straight from S3, save for the first bonus ring area being removed.\n\nThe immediate impression I got from seeing Angel Island Zone was that this is likely one of a small few new zones being added, which then immediately got me thinking about what the new zones will be like, if they'll be original designs ala Mirage Saloon, or if we'll be seeing some classic zones revamped again. And admittedly, for a €5 DLC, I was getting way too far ahead of myself - but that's what hit into my mind until I realised this Angel Island revamp was just thrown in as a small bit of a nostalgic throwback, before my ass was landed back into Green Hill Zone.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong - for a €5 DLC, Sonic Mania Plus is excellent. I got to replay through the main campaign with some small updates, some nice new graphical assets, and a few new routes - all with two new fun playable characters to boot, and a new array of special stage courses. My main issue was that I felt the opening 1-2 minutes sells what in my mind, would've been a different experience entirely.\n\nNow, Sonic Mania isn't the worst offender when it comes to First Impressions - in recent(ish) times, I also felt Skyrim opening with what's essentially a 30min interactive cutscene that has you locked into a small area of the map does a terrible job at selling the gigantic open world that Bethesda has crafted.\n\nWhat do you think of general First Impressions in games? Do you think they matter across the grand scope of things - or do you generally take the road I often would, and discount the first 20-30mins of a game as often not being a great representation of the rest of the content?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8zvlyf/the_case_for_a_modern_daggerfall/",
        "text": "Daggerfall is the second installment in the Elder Scrolls series, and, while most people might be familiar with the series as it was from Morrowind onwards, this game presented a fairly different experience.\n\nThe scope of the game, especially for 1996, is astounding, with an entire region of the game's lore, roughly the size of Great Britain in real world terms, is presented on a 1:1 scale. Numerous cities, villages, and (obligatory) dungeons for the player to explore exist, divided by massive tracts of uninhabited land. Of course, a fast travel feature exists in order to prevent journeys that would take months in real time.\n\nSuch a world demands something to do in it, and there is a main quest the player character is sent at the beginning of the game. However, players are completely free to ignore it and do whatever they feel like doing, should they wish to accept the consequences of such action. And what is there to do? Randomly generated quests from the game's many, many NPC characters, various knightly orders, guilds and other groups of interest, or just plain aimless exploring.\n\nThis is not to say that the game was flawless, though. In finest Bethesda tradition, the game is riddled with bugs to this day, necessitating the use of third-party fixes. Combat is overly simplistic and unsatisfying, and even the extensive spell-making system does little to fix this. The heavy degree of random generation leaves many aspects of the game feel shallow and dull. The interface was not considered good even in its time, and is absolutely horrifying by modern standards.\n\nYet, it is absolutely an unique experience. In spite of almost 22 years passing since the game's release, I haven't seen any game with quite the same feel, with only the Adventure mode of Dwarf Fortress coming close, but that game suffers from an even more hostile user interface. Frankly, I find it baffling that no one has yet tried their own take on Daggerfall's formula.\n\nI want to put to light some of the reasons I think someone should attempt such a thing.\n\n*  It can absolutely said that Daggerfall was a game before its time in many aspects, as many of Daggerfall's shortfalls were directly or indirectly caused by the age of the game. Besides the obvious limitations of the hardware of yore, it is a simple fact that RPGs on the PC were still a young genre. Daggerfall came two years before even Baldur's Gate, and really, the only similar series Bethesda had to look at the time were the Ultima series.\n\n* The scope of game development has significantly expanded with the growth of the industry. Step back from the size and the apparent complexity of Daggerfall, and one can see that its basic building blocks are fairly simple, compared to what might be expected from a modern release. Today, I believe a game like this could be developed by a small to mid sized indie dev team, which would, riding off the previous point, have access to a wealth of game design experience and tools the Bethesda of 1996 did not have.\n\n* The core concept I am describing here also allows a lot of room for expansion. More tilesets for dungeon creation, the addition of some sort of a dynamic reputation, more quests, additional regions, randomized weapon crafting, and numerous other things can all be attached to the core, but are not needed for the core gameplay experience. Although some might disagree that this is a good thing, the Daggerfall model lends itself well to early access, continuous post-release patches, and DLC additions. With a competent development team, this could be leveraged into making a truly great game.\n\nIn conclusion, I think a modern take on Daggerfall's formula could make for a good and unique, if niche, gaming experience. I would love to hear your opinions regarding this idea.\n",

        "text": "This might be a controversial opinion, dunno.\n\n\nIn the recent backlash over various things (Last Jedi, Detroit, Battlefield V, etc), there's often a defense saying, \"They are the owners / creators, they can do whatever they want with their property, and people who don't like it should shut up and just leave / dont buy.\"\n\n\nHowever, I don't think that's a good defense.  Companies want people to become emotionally invested in their products, their stories, their characters.  Companies want people to be intrigued by the mysteries, fall in love with the characters, laugh at the comedy, mourn the tragedies.  \n\n\nCompanies want people to become attached to these stories, because it becomes more profitable for them.  They want people to buy the merchandise.  Talk about it with their friends.  Promote it on the internet.\n\n\nIt seems to me, that if a company wants to profit from people's emotional attachment, then a certain amount of responsibility, or at least risk, is part of the deal.  If the company betrays that attachment, they can't turn around and tell fans they are wrong for caring about the product only when fan reaction is negative.\n\n\nCertainly, the ways in which this backlash manifests is often extremely wrong - (eg. death threats and harrassment on social media targeted towards female actors who were only doing the job they were told, etc), but nevertheless, everyone involved in creation should be aware of the emotional attachments and expectations of the fans you are trying to make money from, or have made money from in the past.  Avoiding the backlash in the first place would also avoid the toxicity.\n\n\nThis might mean that companies and creators have to be a bit more conservative when it comes to existing franchises - eg. no more \"DmC:Devil May Cry\"s, all-girl Ghostbusters, etc.  But in an ideal world, it should also mean that companies and creators must be more willing to create new franchises as well.  Any time a company wants to radically reboot an existing franchise, they should probably just give up on the brand awareness and make something new instead.\n\n\nSo yeah, don't you think that, if a creator seeks to profit from people's emotional attachment to their products, they should accept the risk &amp; responsibility that comes with it?",

But I do not like this design, because games without lock-on like *Jedi Academy* and *Rune* allowed more control and did not need lock-on: at all times you could walk backwards and take side steps, or turn to the sides using the mouse, and if you want face an enemy, aim it with the mouse. It is more elegant, because you do not have to divide the movement in two: out of combat and in combat, and more precise with the movements of the mouse.",

Also, other fighting games are now being changed with the intention of making it more accessible for gamers less familiar with them (such as Blazblue Cross Tag's auto-combos and simpler commands). \n\nSo I'm curious about what you think of this. Is it good for gamers as a whole? Or is it dumbing down the experience a bit? Is it a case by case basis?\n\nPersonally, I don't see any problems with it. My only exception probably is games like Dark Souls where the difficulty feels central to the experience and tied up into the game's atmosphere. Imagining an easy mode for it seems weird. It is a rare exception for me though.\n\nAccessibility in fighting games is probably a different topic compared to adding easy mode to an existing game so I'm not sure if it fits into this topic... but what do you think? I'm really interested in hearing people's take on this.",

        "text": "I used to love playing video games, and I played them all the time. Nowadays, though, I’m having trouble keeping playing them. I really want to love video games but it’s really hard for me to actually play them. \n\nFirst of all I am very bad at video games. For reference I didn’t beat any video games until 2014, and that was Pokemon X and Y. When I play platformers especially I get frustrated and worked up which makes my playing even worse. It turns what should be very fun into an aggravating and exhausting experience most of the time. \n\nI also have a very short attention span. This makes it difficult to keep playing a single video game for more than about an hour, especially if it’s a harder section. Low motivation for actually picking a game up means that after my attention span runs out and I get bored or worked up and I put down a game, I won’t pick it back up for a while. It doesn’t help that I have a very busy schedule most of the time, so I have little time to play any video games in the first place\n\nThe kicker was that my friend, who is an amazing person, nothing against him, beats video games very fast. His hobby is to beat as many video games as he can. I’ve been playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 since it came out and I still haven’t beat it, and about a month ago he beat it in four days. Again, nothing against him, but it makes me feel even worse for not being able to do something that I treat as one of my favorite things. It’s really frustrating that especially the kind of games I play— Nintendo games— which are usually designed to be accessible by everyone, are games that I can’t even play well. \n\nDoes anyone else have any of these problems? Is there a way to get around my “gamer’s block”, for lack of a better word, and start to like playing video games again?",

        "text": "I recently replayed Dear Esther, which I think is a gorgeous game, and since it was the 'Landmark Edition' I checked out the developer commentary. The stuff the Chinese Room were saying about their game was fascinating. Something that really struck me was something Dan Pinchbeck said about the game's writing, and game writing in general. He was commenting on the game's ambiguous, vague and poetic writing style, and he expressed that before making Dear Esther he felt frustrated at how pedestrian gaming tends to be when it comes to writing.\n\nVisually and aurally gaming can be very daring and experimental, he explained, but for some reason writing, which obviously has the potential to be the most meaningful and beautiful of all the art forms, is always a very dull affair: most games interest themselves only with exposition. Before Dear Esther, everything was just so *literal*. The best you could hope for was slick, well-crafted Hollywood-style writing focused on narrative and clarity. No games, or perhaps only very few, dedicated to poetic writing: that is to say writing involving a great deal of metaphor, prioritising *expression* and *feeling* over clarity and sense.\n\nSince Esther we've had The Chinese Room's masterpiece Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and various other indie attempts at poetic writing. But honestly even today I still don't think there's enough out there. Certainly I can't think of any mainstream (or non-indie) games that employ poetic rather than prosaic writing. There are games that are very well written: Tearaway Unfolded is an obvious example, or more recently Cory Barlog's new God of War, but these are not *poetic* in the sense that Dan Pinchbeck meant. A few games attempt it at points and fall flat on their face, like Shadow of the Colossus (the writing being the game's only flaw).\n\nWhat do you think? Why has one of the oldest art forms in the world not survived the age of the microchip?",

        "text": "Biggest examples that immediately come to mind in my opinion:\n\n[Megalovania - Undertale:](https://youtu.be/ZcoqR9Bwx1Y) Seriously, take a look at the bigger picture here, Sans worshippers; we're talking about one of *THE* greatest and most thoroughly memorable soundtracks (to one of the greatest and most thoroughly memorable *games* ever made, naturally enough; note that this is going to be a very common theme here) of all time, and *this* is seriously the only landmark song you can think of from it? Do I really need to mention the other final boss themes (Hopes And Dreams Will SAVE The World, Asgore, Your Best Nightmare, Alphys Takes Action, Cloudburst, etc), basically all of which have *vastly* more to their compositions than this one and also aren't blatantly copied from previous Toby Fox productions (cough, Homestuck OST and Radiation's Halloween Hack, wheeze), as well as the Waterfall/Hotland themes and pretty much all of the *other* boss themes while we're at it, just to name a few? Hell, even the *dating* theme for God's sake? I mean yeah, I get it, the song *is* an incredibly awesome and unexpected use of heavy metal music for a rather unexpectedly awesome and difficult fight and thus is easily one of *the* most iconic and memorable moments of a game that is already chock-full and positively *brimming* with them beyond belief, but...sorry, guys, this is objectively NOT the best song in its soundtrack, *period.* Even calling Sans \"undeniably\" the best overall boss fight in the game (dialogue and death scene aside) is honestly pretty debatable when you have bosses like Mettaton EX, Undying Undyne, Asgore and Asriel to compare him to.\n\n[One-Winged Angel - Final Fantasy VII:](https://youtu.be/t7wJ8pE2qKU) Again, *EASILY ONE OF THE GREATEST ROLE-PLAYING-GAME SOUNDTRACKS OF ALL TIME* and this is *seriously* the only song from it that ever gets any recognition? Don't get me wrong, I won't deny that finally hearing it in-game (living out the meme, if you will, once I *finally* managed to beat the titular Sephiroth superform that the song is named after with only one anti-status-ailment ribbon) would have been a pretty freaking epic moment in the game even *without* the legendarily infamous galaxy-exploding Supernova attack to back it up, but eh...I personally felt that both of the other phases of FFVII's final boss had quite nearly *as* good of music as this one, without even *beginning* to mention the rest of the soundtrack (seriously, I sincerely doubt that most of the people calling this \"unanimously the best song in the game\" have *ever* heard the main overworld theme in all of its tear-jerkingly orchestrated, nearly ten-minute-long glory...)\n\n[Dr. Wily's Theme (Wily Stage 1) - Mega Man 2:](https://youtu.be/HFKtYCcMWT4) Simply put, it's a pretty tight debate between this (an obscenely overrated game in general, thanks to Metal Blades) and Mega Man 9 as to which Classic Era MM installment has the best overall soundtrack (for the record, MM3 is a pretty huge contender as well), but you simply cannot deny the MM2 soundtrack's well-deservedly eternal status as being undisputedly *the* catchiest and most memorable of the franchise. So again, tell me; *why* does this song *always* hog all of the attention in the MM series when stage themes like Air Man's, Tornado Man's, Shade Man's, Flash Man's, Spark Man's, Slash Man's and Top Man's (just to name a few) exist? Not to mention the Wily music from Mega Mans 3, 7 and 9? Long story short, this song is good, but the Wily music from 7 and 9 in particular *completely* destroys it in pretty much every possible way.\n\n[Lower Brinstar - Super Metroid:](https://youtu.be/Pim1s_DBR64) Once again, I'm not exactly willing to deny how jaw-droppingly epic of a moment it was the first time I took the westmost Crateria elevator straight down into Overgrown Brinstar, heard its *RIDICULOUSLY* badass music and saw how incredibly beautiful the place's environmental design was for the game's early-1990s side-scrolling time (not to mention how *astonishingly* much the area had changed both thematically and layout-wise between the first game and Super, a charm that the game's incarnation of Norfair sadly did not possess to even *nearly* the same extent)...but holy Jesus of *NAZARETH* is this song overused and *especially* overrated by Metroid fans. It's been remixed *at least* seventeen thousand freaking times (like Wily Stage 1), it has far more impressive songs \"competing\" against it on the soundtrack that it occupies (like One-Winged Angel and Megalovania), and it's also a glorified five-second loop (like Megalovania). To give it credit where credit is due, *yes,* the song is *incredibly* creepy and atmospheric, gives off a rather admittedly hauntingly beautiful Eastern Asiatic vibe and most certainly does *sound* jaw-droppingly amazing for the time (and also that piano solo; seriously, *THAT* piano solo), and yes, some of its remixes (including the official ones) are indeed [pretty far *beyond* amazing...](https://youtu.be/r-XlzFtKDV8)but in its base form, Upper Brinstar and Lower Norfair (as well as the opening/credits themes, Maridia's music and Samus' theme) were *miles* better of songs.\n\n[Use Your Head (Buttville: The Descent) - Earthworm Jim:](https://youtu.be/g6QJ1m7EQ3I) All I can say is holy *CRAP* is this song overglorified. Earthworm Jim is a game that takes you not only through all *kinds* of fascinatingly exotic and often grotesque intergalactic locales (ranging from the world's largest trash landfill to Hell itself to *two* entire planets respectively made out of mucus and intestines to the world's largest and scariest *wood* landfill [Special Edition only, of course] to, well, Buttville itself) but also through all *kinds* of different genres of mostly-rock music (classic 1980s big-band rock in New Junk City, old-fashioned hillbilly country rock in Andy Asteroids and the ending theme, *elevator* music in the main portion of What The Heck, electronic rock in Snot A Problem, R&amp;B in Down The Tubes AKA Level 5, *more* R&amp;B in For Pete's Sake, classic horror-movie music in Big Bruty and Intestinal Distress, classical ragtime piano music in Who Turned Out The Lights, and finally *more* electronic rock in both sections of Buttville, with an ever-so-vague J-pop resemblance for the latter section). And THIS is seriously the only song from EWJ that anyone actually pays attention to whenever someone posts it on the official /r/gamemusic subreddit. It's literally just an endless three-note arpeggio that goes on *forever* (as for the admittedly badass guitar solo at the end section of the version I just linked, please note that the solo, as of now, is 100 percent *exclusive* to that specific version). I certainly won't deny that it fits the segments it's used in (as well as the whole prospect of skydiving in general) *unbelievably* perfectly, but that's pretty much all I can say about it.\n\n[Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time - Song Of Storms:](https://youtu.be/L1Zln8X9ZRY) (Is currently ranked as #1 in Best Zelda Music on TheTopTens.com (yes, even above absolute masterpieces like Midna's Lament, ALTTP's Dark World and Hyrule Castle themes, and the Hyrule Field themes from OOT and Twilight Princess) and really isn't even the best of the literal Ocarina songs; [Song Of Healing from Majora's Mask](https://youtu.be/XDX4ZwUeOok) *EASILY* takes the cake in *that* regard (I rest my case)\n\n[Parappa The Rapper (PSX Original) - The Entire Soundtrack In General:](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCD8F4E11AD9B5840) Apart from just being an overall terrible game in general when compared to its sequels, Parappa 1 also objectively had *extremely* weak music compared to its sequels in all honesty (more on that *very* soon, trust me), combined with an even more extremely generic and boring storyline (which its sequels also went on to have rather *QUITE* the exact opposite of, mind you)...but sadly, most critics tend to disagree, seemingly *solely* because of how innovative the game was to its rhythm genre at the time. Without even mentioning [Parappa 2's soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99BB4AB0E27FB6A8) (which in general is *much* more professionally produced, sounds *way* cooler and, apart from Hair Scare, has *considerably* more entertaining lyrics than that of the first one), let's take a second to mention (just like with all of the other EWJ songs compared to Use Your Head) how *very* evidently more creative, ambitious, varied and overall impressive [UmJammer Lammy's soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOqYa2mCm4JHWMZ04U5018dP0WLitlAAI) was compared to that of the first game. (No, I'm not just saying this because ~~Lammy is so ball-bustingly sexy~~ the game itself is such a fantastically, lovingly crafted work of art either).\n\nWhereas Parappa 1's music basically covers only one genre (boring, watered-down kiddie rap) and feels excruciatingly lame and predictable as a result, UmJammer Lammy goes *all* the way up and down the ~~autistic~~ rock n' roll spectrum and makes sure to *hilariously* bombastically and parodically cover pretty much *every* single genre of music possible within its measly seven stages (J-Pop-Grunge-Rock in I Am A Master And You, Soul Jazz in Fire Fire, Disney Musical in Treasure, Chuck-Berry-Style Classic Rock in Baby Baby, Emo Grunge Metal in Fright Flight, Country Rock in Casino In My Hair, Rockabilly in Power Off Power On, J-Pop-Romance in Taste Of Teriyaki, and *finally* Classic Girl-Band Rock in Got To Move...and, of course, various types of good old-fashioned rap for all of the Parappa versions of the playable songs) and just generally comes from a *vastly* more interesting game than the rest of its series.\n\nIf you have any more personal gripes to add about incredibly overrated music from games, leave them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But one thing they all have in common is that they had pretty average or lower budgets for the most part or were made by small-ish indie teams.\n\nI think those games are fine as is, but I've always wondered what it would look like if a AAA developer/publisher made a game like those but with a budget near the same size as some games in the GTA, Halo, COD, Witcher series of games in the past.  All of those games looked and ran beautifully when they came out (albeit with some bugs still).  I'd love an multiplayer open-world survival game similar in setting to 7 Days to Die or Mad Max that looked as good and ran as well as the Witcher 3.\n\nAbout the only thing that seems to be close to a AAA produced game in this genre might be Fallout 76, and even then I doubt it will be as survival-like as Fallout 4's Survival mode.\n\nDo the large publishers not think the genre is worth the time or money?  Because the player counts and sales counts say otherwise.",

        "text": "First of all I would like to state that this is my opinion and my general experience I have had on forums and conversations alike. Also, I would like to stress on the reader and say that famous characters we recognise from 30 years ago and theme music we still recognise from the games of our childhood is not what my post is about - we all love those memories, but moreover my post is about how they can improve our gaming experience and where the future lies in it.\n\nI would like to start off this post and say that I will use 3 games to exhibit what I am talking about as I believe they perfectly illustrate what a good art and music can have on the player. We will look at the 3 following games (**spoiler free**)\n\nJourney\n\n\nAbzu\n\n\nRime\n\n\n\nRight off the bat [for those that have played these games] you will notice these aren’t stressful games, but games that I like to call ‘lounging games’ or games that you don’t have to be on the edge of your seat, but games you can play when you want to have a peaceful time, lean back in your chair, and dig into your imagination. \n\n\nI will start off with Journey as it was the first game I played and we shall explore what makes it a great experience. I invite the reader to listen to a soundtrack from the game composed by the great Austin Wintory: https://youtu.be/ypNgvc6c6Cc in the background whilst they read my what I have to say on journey all whilst using their imagination and mind to feel what that part of the game would be like: is it sad, happy, exciting, mysterious, fast, alluring? - And what do you think the player is doing? Journey starts off with you in the middle of a desert with no narrator, no objective screen, and there is no voice acting - just music, scenery, and your mind constantly asking what is your goal and where will you end up. Out of the 3 games, this is the only game with an online feature but the player discovers this in a very unique way - when you play the game, and as you make your way through a stage, you *may* see a character like yourself, there is no voice chat and no indication that there is a human behind the character, and without words you are on this mystical journey together. [Going through harsh storms](http://www.videogamenarrative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/12-1-pre-death-lone-wanderer.jpg) - [to scaling the endless sand dunes](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/journeygame/images/f/f8/Desert_2P_Trek4.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20120324212706) The music perfectly guides the player through each stage and keepers morale high and you track on through the mysterious land. You develop this friendship through nothing but *signaling* to make sure they’re okay. This clip will illustrate some of my points : https://youtu.be/R8UhCvDPUGQ I would like to address the reader [rhetorically] that how a part of the game such as show would be like without music and without and immersion in the environment.\n\n\nAbzû is a game that illustrates the great power of colour and the serenity it gives the player. Like Journey, you find yourself in the middle of nowhere, this time in an ocean and I again invite the reader to listen to a soundtrack whilst using their imagination to what the game might be like: https://youtu.be/xesroowWKjA. From the rich and low sounds of Journey, we head to calm and restful sounds as we explore a deep ocean and coming across [real] species that [invite us to explore with them](http://indiehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ABZU7.jpg) I would also like to add that I cannot think of a game that uses such a beautiful use of the colour palette from [the green habitats](http://static2.fore.4pcdn.de/premium/Screenshots/11/5e/92530242-vollbild.png) - [to the orange](http://static1.fore.4pcdn.de/premium/Screenshots/59/0d/92530250-vollbild.png) - [to the red](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/797/27033352678_7584e00a0a_b.jpg) - the game even encourages (via achievements/trophies) to find [spots to meditate](https://gameplaying.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/abzu-chapter-3-meditation-statue-8-1.jpg) One can only assume that even the developers intended the player to clear their mind and explore this world around them whilst taking it all in - treat it as a marathon and not a sprint. \n\n\nLast but not least we shall talk about Rime and like with the previous two examples, I invite the reader to listen to the soundtrack and imagine what meaning it conveys: https://youtu.be/ACDIQW-4xjo . Rime, like the other two games starts you off on a mystery - as a young boy you find yourself on an island and as you wander around discover puzzles you need to solve. The first thing which comes to mind when do these activities is not only does it remind me of playing  as a young child where you find it fun to roam around and explore the environment finding out what you have to do, but how rich and wonderful the colour scheme  the artist chose: From [crisp, minimalist details](http://www.nintenderos.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rime...jpg) , [to the clear, starry night](https://i.imgur.com/zsyXLoJ.jpg) I personally find roaming around looking for what you have to do a chore in modern games as they are not interesting and there is a sense of *why should I/what’s so special about this?* Rime is the first game I have seen where such repeated - and dare I say *cliche* tasks aren’t bothersome but rather enjoyable due to the immersion the player receives. Rime [and the games above] won’t win hearts over by groundbreaking graphics but I do believe it highlights a very interesting topic that simplicity and good art can give the player a large sense of joy when playing.\n\n\n\nHopefully I have given the reader some insight into how music can give you an experience playing a game but what do the statistics say - moreover how does it improve our experience when playing a game and how a player can become immersed in a video game? I have to stress that I don’t for a minute suggest that music and artwork  are the most important factors in a video game, moreover I do believe that they could improve a players’ experience and would even go as far to say mental wellbeing - even if it is for a short period. An article from [The Journal of Psychology &amp;amp;amp;amp; Psychotherapy](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-influence-of-background-music-of-video-games-on-immersion-2161-0487-1000191.php?aid=58693#44) conducted a test on the influence of background music of video games and found ;\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;”* The results basically supported the hypothesis at the beginning. The background music did increase players’ immersion. Just as the SCI model illustrated, sensory immersion, as the one of three fundamental factors, indeed can exert vital influences to players’ overall experience. Background music improves the narrative experience and can be used to guide the player through the game. Whalen claimed that music may be encouraging the immersion which must compliment engaging with the game’s scripts. Some other researches also got similar results. All of these results showed that the background music had some kind of effect on players’ immersion.*”\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt; “*In present study, compared to without background music, the video game with music would be much more attractive and appealing to gamers. So the gamers with music were more easily absorbed into the gameplay and forgot the time passing, which leaded to a more serious time distortion. Sanders and Cairns [36] have conducted a similar research and got a same result. This meant that the time distortion paradigm is indeed a stable and effective measurement of immersion.*” \n\n\nI would like to hear if you have had similar experiences in games and how gamers could push developers to invest and spend time on a part of the game that seems to be overlooked.

It is well known that they have poor management and treat their employees like shit. I believe that this was the reason that drove them to near bankruptcy a couple of years ago.\n\nLets make a list of the talent they lost throughout the years. If I miss someone please let me know.\n\n* **Shinji Mikam**i: The legendary creator of the survival horror genre and founder of CloverStudios( which later disbanded and became PlatinumGames). This is one of my favorite game developers of all time. He directed classics  like the original RE game, REmake, RE4, GodHand, Vanquish and now has his own game studio who is working under the Bethesda Softworks brand called Tango Gameworks. Tango has developed the fairly popular survival horror series The Evil Within.\n\n* **Atsushi Inaba**: CEO of Platinum Games. He produced most of Clover´s games and now serves as a producer for Platinum Games.\n\n* **Hideki Kamiya**: Director of RE2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Okami and Bayonetta1. Works for Platinum Games.\n\n* **Keiji Inafune**: Designer and Producer of the Megaman series. Founded his own company called Comcept who later developed Might No.9 and Recore.\n\n* **Akira Nishitani**: Designer of SF2 and Final Fight. He also developed the Street Fighter EX series for Capcom. Currently has his own game studio called Arika which released a new fighting game passion project.\n\nI think the only two oldschool developers who are still working at Capcom are Yoshinori Ono who is in charge of division 2 and the FG related part of Capcom and Hideaki Itsuno who has worked on games like Power Stone, Capcom vs Snk, Dragons Dogma and is now working on Devil May Cry 5.\n\nCapcom has been getting better and is slowly coming out from those dark days but damn that is some lost talent right there.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8z55je/narrative_related_to_player_characters_in_mmos/",
        "text": "Given everything that happened the last few weeks -- with what started as someone talking about how to write for the player characters in an MMO, I think there is a valuable discussion to have on the topic. This is decidedly ***not*** about the controversy and fallout, this is about the topic of: **Narrative**, **Player Character**, &amp; **MMOs**\n\nThe two broad categories of systems within MMOs are Sandbox, and Themepark. Most games mix systems related to both but the general idea can be seen as:\n\n* Themepark\n * Everything exists **for** the player *character*\n * It is a tightly constructed experience to streamline the player from one thing to the next\n* Sandbox\n * Tools (a toolbox) exists to facilitate what the player wishes to do\n * Everything is constructed as it's needed, without much organization\n\nWith those 2 general guides down -- it's worth mentioning again. Most MMO games ***mix*** both these systems throughout the game. There might be elements of Sandbox PvP, while questing is Themepark, for example.\n\nThis topic specifically resides in the Narrative of the Player Character. Players create all kinds of different characters, and these characters are meant to interact with the world in some *meaningful* way.\n\n* Player Character dialogue is intended to be generic and vague, allowing players to infer their specific characterizations in to the scenes.\n* The most narrative rich content comes from the NPCs that the PC interacts with. NPCs are supposed to be interesting because the develops *can* control them.\n* Anytime an NPC directly references the actions of the PC, it's because that action *had* to be taken by all players in order to get to that point in the game.\n * There is no option to save a village vs letting it get destroyed -- the game forces players to save the village but the motivations are vague enough to let players come up with their own reasons for why their PC did it.\n * In the end, an NPC will say \"Thank you, hero, for saving our village!\" No other option was presented to the player.\n* Relationships are one sided\n * An NPC warms up to the PC, but the PC *can't* directly reciprocate\n * The PC becomes more friendly with an NPC, but the NPC can't directly address *why* they are becoming friends.\n\nIf this formula is broken -- you often get very strange interactions between NPCs and PCs, where you the player, who has grown very attached to the character you made... says very strange things for very strange reasons.\n\n* \"Thank you, hero, for saving our village from the demon king's legion whom you hate and have no allegiance to.\"\n* \"Indeed, I, the hero only loves your kingdom's Queen, and have no personal ties to the Demon King, and *certainly* don't want them to be the ruler of this land!\"\n\nMeanwhile your character is an evil Necromancer who just got done running errands for a Commander within the Demon King's army. This is a lazily written example, but we can see the problems with directly addressing characterizations in dialogue.\n\nThere are many directions to take the discussion from here.\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the above example is a \"Narrative for Player Character, in a **Themepark**\". That is the core issue -- because it's all correct in terms of the Themepark. In a themepark mmo, there is a strange juxtaposition between your PC being told they are an amazing hero, and there is no one else like them, while 5 seconds later you see the same thing get told to someone else. OR, you simply know by virtue of being in an MMO, that it's been told to a million other players. How can hundreds of thousands of other players all be the \"hero\" who is irreplaceable? It doesn't matter how many writers and programmers you have writing for the PC in an MMO, you'll never address every possible variable for why the *player* wants their *character* to be participating in the story. The core problem, is on \"Themepark\" narrative.\n\nAn mmo player character isn't *supposed* to be the hero of time and space, and bring order to a chaotic universe. They are simply there to be a witness. You are just some random passerby, that might be amazing in your own right, but never needs to be acknowledged by ***legendary*** NPCs for it to be validated. Themepark MMOs struggle to do well. FFXIV is growing, and while they will celebrate having \"10 million players\", that number is highly debated. Is that 10 million unique players who have at least *tried* the game? [Active](https://ffxivcensus.com/active-experiment/) players is estimated (if a 3rd party fan-site is to believed) at an even lower point than WoW's last official active player count. Most, modern MMOs utilize the same Themepark PC narrative formula -- and given that WoW active users dropped below 6 million, is a Themepark PC system really what 12 million originally signed up for? Maybe someone can help me out but I'm struggling to find evidence that games with a modern Themepark PC narrative, are (or even can be) thriving. GW2, FFXIV and WoW have not even come close to touching WoW's 12 million peak.\n\nThere are possibly many reasons for this worth exploring more -- but in terms of the PC and it's who, what, why, where and when -- it is worth going back to a more sandbox approach that helped *thrive* growth of the genre. You are an adventurer (not a hero), who is in a world with challenges that one person can not handle by themselves, and needs to enlist the help of others. The \"***meaningful way***\" your character interacts with the world, is on the effects that happens to the actual world because of your character. It's in things that are not *immediately* acknowledged or even seen.\n\nYes, you saved a village, and maybe now that village produces more crops, feeding an army and helping shift the balance of power. Maybe after you save the village \"from the demon king\", you then help the demon king attack and raid food transports from that village, securing an easy supply of food. Or, maybe your character is \"good\" and instead helps the kingdom by protecting those transports from attacks. Branching dialogue be damned -- it's all about the actual effects of actions. When the end result of those actions is a binary \"Kingdom falls to control to the Demons\" or \"Kingdom successfully stop an invasion\", all the smaller sandbox set pieces *are* the branching activities that help you define your character. It's not a result of dialogue, but actions.\n\nThe events of the world *should* feel big to the player. They should feel important, and untouchable. And it shouldn't be a simple dialogue option that changes entire events. It won't result in a big name NPC thanking, or cursing the player. The player will *know* that *they* were the one who either saved the day, or ruined an NPC's plans, and they'll know *why*.\n\n---\n\nIs there a way, in your mind, to do Themepark PCs in MMOs \"better\", with more identity and meaning. Or do we really need to go back to more Sandbox PCs, with modern technology so things players do could potentially matter. Maybe any narrative related to the PC just doesn't matter, and we should refocus our efforts on just making sure character development has enough depth and give the player absolutely *no* narrative power, instead relying entirely on interesting powerful NPCs and dense player character classes? What else is there?",

Things are now changing, and the Western gaming community is becoming more and more diverse. Just look at, for example, games such as Minecraft, Fortnite, and even older titles such as World of Warcraft or EVE which have older and more female player bases. They have extremely diverse player bases, and for games such as Overwatch, also extremely diverse character line-ups that is becoming increasingly common.\n\nI have also noticed that more and more games are being released with more diverse character casts or backgrounds, particularly in the indie game scene. I'd never would have thought that one of my favorite characters in a Wolfenstein game would be a black woman.\n\nThat being said, some things have been \"fumbled\", so to speak. For example, Battlefield V's initial trailer prominently featuring a woman with a prosthetic limb was a bit jarring for me, particularly for a reveal trailer that is supposed to set the stage for a WWII title. The trailer itself wasn't too bad, but DICE's reaction to people was a bit unfortunate.\n\nAlso...there has been a lot of pushback. A (very) vocal minority of gamers have accused developers of being \"too PC\" and by \"pandering\" when they introduce non-white male characters. How do you guys feel about this? Do you feel as developers engaging too heavily in blatant identity politics? Do you disagree with the reactionaries? Do you welcome these new changes, but disagree with how they have been handled? What about games journalists?\n\nDon't be too uncivil!",

        "text": "I was listening to the Giant Beastcast over the weekend, and they brought up the discussion of Jessica Price being fired from ArenaNet. While I don’t personally share their opinion regarding her firing, I was a bit taken aback when they raised an interesting point around the 50-minute mark, [which you can listen to here](https://www.giantbomb.com/podcasts/beastcast/), regarding how Mike O’Brien handled the situation. The “tl;dr” on this is that they basically pointed out that it felt to them that O’Brien was more so concerned with upholding a particular image of ArenaNet that was invented by the general gaming population (making her firing more of an appeasement to the masses) than he was concerned with protecting the actual company. This came from the language of his own keyboard, where he wrote:\n\n&gt; Recently two of our employees failed to uphold our standards of communicating with players. Their attacks on the community were unacceptable. As a result, they’re no longer with the company.\n\n&gt; As a company **we always strive to have a collaborative relationship** with the Guild Wars community. **We value your input. We make this game for you.**\n\nSource: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/586426#Comment_586426\n\nI do not want to argue about the firing or what she said. Those conversations have been had, and you’re welcome to read them. What I want to talk about is the content that I bolded: “We always strive to have a collaborative relationship … We value your input. We make this game for you.”\n\nWe hear this a lot from developers and publishers, and I just have to wonder: is it going to our heads? Is this industry with its “early access” releases and “games as a service” putting too much emphasis on player opinion? Should developers actually value our feedback? Should the relationship between gamer, developer, and publisher be “collaborative?”\n\nIn a vacuum, I would probably not be too concerned about this. What Mike O’Brien does is not necessarily representative of the industry at large. Guild Wars 2 is a relatively popular game – a game I even used to play and sunk thousands of hours into – but it’s not like what MO does decides the general course of action here.\n\nBut then again, I can’t help but think about other situations like the turmoil surrounding Stellaris and its Chinese localization from a few months ago, an issue that has almost single-handledly sunk [a game with a “mostly positive” overall rating to one having a “mixed” reception among recent reviews](https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/) – and despite the difference in subject matter, I can’t help but see these events as related in some way.\n\nYou’ll notice that most of their recent reviews, if you include all languages and not just English, are complaining that Stellaris doesn’t have Chinese localization – a promise that the developers/publishers of Stellaris Paradox Interactive never made. Still, if you look back over the past 2+ months you can see pages of pages of reviews like [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198181073458/recommended/281990). \n\nChinese players have deemed themselves an important enough community worth paying attention to, and so they take Paradox’s choice not to localize the game into Chinese as an insult, review-bombing the game on Steam until they get the version that Paradox Interactive never officially worked on.\n\nChinese players see themselves as important enough to be worth paying attention to. And, to take the words of Mike O’Brien, they believe their opinions should be valued and that the game should be in some way developed for them. I am not saying whether or not they’re right or wrong to think so, but in the broader continuum of other events, I can’t help but think that the narrative Mike O’Brien is feeding about gamers as collaborators is ultimately putting game developers at the disadvantage.\n \nThis is just one instance in recent memory I can think where players have taken it upon themselves to regard themselves as more than just consumers, but I’m sure there are plenty of others, caused by gamers viewing themselves as collaborators in the decision-making process. And if a developer or publisher does not cave to their demands, they will review-bomb, charge-back, or tarnish the reputation of the games they supposedly love.\n\nSo, I guess my question(s) to spur this into a conversation is/are:\n\n* Are gamers taking too much ownership in the products they play?\n* What are the broader ramifications if gamers do? Where are we headed as an industry?\n* How can publishers/developers more efficiently communicate what they are and aren’t capable of to avoid overhype or over-expectations?\n* What are some other games you think suffer from its community taking too much ownership in the design process?\n* What are some games you think effectively manage their products without too much outside influence?\n\nThank you.",

He then sent me a 10 minute audio \"explaining\" why visual novels and zports games arent really games.\n\n-Visual Novels dont require skills to play.\n-Visual Novels solely focus on the story.\n-Your choices dont really matter, the game is still conducing you to an end.\n-It is making japanese men trade real women for virtual ones.\n\n-People who play sports games are jocks who are not interested in other types of games and often mock \"real gamers\".\n-People are atracted to sports games because of the real game, not because of the gameplay, graphics or whatever.\n-There are no skills or strategy required to play sports games or even real sports.\n\nI would like some help, sorry for any english mistakes.",

        "text": "* Preface – This is a subjective opinion from a modder (and occasional author) who finds modding TES and FO one of the pinnacles of the gaming experience. I’ve yet to find anything quite like a modded out Fallout or TES and will fight for more games like them with my wallet and posts like these. I can be a bit of a cynic given Bethesda’s recent pushes for paid-mods and the removal of RPG elements from these franchises so please bear with me.\n\n* There are plenty of good arguments for expanding FO/TES into other genres from people who love the SP games. The most common one I see is that that they’re still developing the SP games and are letting other companies develop the MP games hence nothing is lost. However, what I seem to realize that no one else does is that companies have **FINITE RESOURCES**. Just because they outsource the development of their MP games does not mean those resources could not be used to help create the SP games. The most common issue people have with the SP games is how buggy they are either due to sloppy development or the dilapidated, buggy engine. They could use resources used on Fallout Shelter into a better game engine or fixing all the bugs that come with their SP games. Perhaps those resources could have been used to write a better story with more complex choices rather than the pick-a-side atrocity that was Fallout 4. Could a company not be outsourced that would TOTALLY revamp their engine? People act like Bethesda has an infinite amount of resources and they can just throw around their IP to any company willing without their SP game quality suffering on some level and that simply isn’t true.\n\n* The primary reason I care about the quality of the SP TES/FO games is because, particularly on the PC platform, they are completely unique within the gaming world. There simply are no other 3D RPGs that allow the user to modify everything. Are there new community-made quests that I can download for The Witcher 3? Absolutely not. I honestly believe that my modded out Skyrim is the best singleplayer experience I can get, but to be quite frank, I find the game mediocre as a whole when played unmodded. I still go back to FO3, FONV as well as Oblivion and Morrowind just to modify them with new(ish) mods every year or so. There forays into other genres are replicated ten times over and don’t offer much of anything unique. There are dozens of TESO’s, Fallout Shelters, and TESL’s and they are better than Bethesda’s games. I would have to be the ultimate fanboy to chose Bethesda’s games over other games in that genre. To be fair, TESO has come a long way and many people enjoy it, but it still isn’t a genre that made Bethesda who they are today.  \n\n* There are plenty of good rebuttals to my statements. The best one I can think of is that for-profit companies exist to make money and that is what they’re doing. Fair enough. Fallout 76 also seems to offer something somewhat new. If they can pull it off, I will probably will purchase it as opposed to their other non-SP FO/TES games. I’m still going to fight for better SP TES/FO games because they are just that good, but they can be SOOOOO much better. For sake of keeping this short, I’m not going to go into corporate strategy. Check out who the Board of Directors are at Zenimax sometime though, you’ll see these people probably don’t give a shit about games and want that money.\n\nPS – I would also give me left pinky for just a coop version of their games. Let us modify it, no pvp, no loot boxes, just straight up coop FO4 with a friend or two. ",

        "text": "I recently played a game of Civ 6 after leaving it uninstalled for a good while. I remember last playing the game and thinking, \"Fuck this game. This is trash compared to earlier *better* Civ games . . .\" but I actually had a pretty decent time. It was more like, \"This is fine\" with a sprinkling of minor annoyances.\n\nHowever, one thing I remember disliking even with the older '*superior*' versions of Civ was the domination victory because of how tedious it is. By the end of a Civ game you might have dozens of units that all need individual orders every turn in military campaigns that span 50+ turns. Any time you go for a military victory in Civ it becomes this slow march of endless, tiresome troop movements. Whole columns of units getting bottlenecked by a hill tile. \n\nI remember last time I quit Civ 6 it was after achieving dominance I had to march my army seemingly forever one pitiless tile at a time, one unit at a time, and thinking - \"This is it. This is the apex form of this game.\" Having a massive invincible army on the warpath could not feel more powerless, self-defeating, **un-fun**. Having the best stuff and taking it out for exercise is easily the worst part of Civ when it represents the peak performance of your civilization.\n\n***************************************\n\n**So that's the problem as I see it**. Towards the end of Civ your command structure grows the point where micro-managing it is no longer fun. Yet that mechanic of growing out your Civ's capabilities *is* the fun engaging part of Civ. That seems like a contradiction which could benefit from a solution. \n\nDominion victories expose this problem to the light. On the other hand I think the current model does have some unintended benefits. If you are trying to simulate large-scale troop movements realistically - I think it probably is a lot of tedium and boredom. In a game about simulating international relationships, maybe you don't want to represent killing your neighbors as a fun and exciting path. \n\nI don't know. I just don't think fighting in Civ is or was in a particularly great place. \n\n**What do you think could be done to improve combat in Civ titles?**\n",

Going by how gaming evolved in the West we see that this term never really took hold though. The closest we have in the West might be something like 'quest designer' (for RPGs). What about games like doom (2016) though, do we call the scenario designers  'campaign lead' or 'lead writers'? I don't know but this seems a bit loaded to me.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nI suppose my main question is, why didn't big studios like Psygnosis / Atari just adopt the expression 'scenario designer' and keep parity with the naming conventions laid down in the east? Was it coincidental, purposeful, maybe a little of both? Would any industry vets on r/truegaming like to chime in here?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nP.S shoutout to Alex from shmuplations.com for all the great work he is doing in translating old Japanese interviews. Check his site out of you get the chance, you won't regret it!\n\n",

        "text": "I made a post recently that somewhat explained the \"Thor Rating System\" that my friends and I have been using recently for when we talk about what games we should play or not. I really don't like the 1-10 system as, for whatever reason, it starts at 6 and it also makes people think that a JRPG rated as a 8 is being compared to a Platformer that is a 9... When you're comparing apples to oranges it doesn't really help to put them on the same number scale. They are vastly different games with vastly different audiences.\n\nThe Thor Rating System is all about a game being worthy or unworthy of your time. Is that JRPG worthy of your time? Is that FPS unworthy of your time?\n\nSome unworthy games may become worthy down the line and vice versa. This is a living system. It's also highly subjective and doesn't use numbers that may imply some sort of math went into it. \n\n\n**Unworthy**\n\nThese are games that are poorly made, stretches the meaning of \"game\", or generally not worth your time outside of just seeing what's going on with it. These could also be games that have some sort of historical elements to them and were *amazing* in their time, but don't really have much going for them today. \n\nSome games that originally were worthy can become unworthy over time due to quality of life improvements, remakes/remasters, or just realizing that the game wasn't all that great and it was hype that made it worthy at one point.\n\nI actually believe a lot of old games can fall under this title. As this title only cares about playing a game, and not all the ancillary elements of the game, even the original Donkey Kong could be considered unworthy by today's standards (even if I love playing it drunk).\n\n**Worthy**\n\nThese are games that are worth your time to play. A worthy game may not be the best in its genre or even its series, but it isn't unworthy of your time. People who are fans of that sort of game will find it enjoyable. \n\nSometimes non-fans of the genre may find it enjoyable but even if they don't, they will usually be able to tell that others would find it enjoyable. I don't like Minecraft, but I would call it a worthy game as it does what it does very well and people love it for what it does.\n\n**Unpopular Opinions of Worthy/Unworthy Games**\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series. I think Final Fantasy I (NES) and Final Fantasy VII are unworthy games. Final Fantasy I because of the quality of life improvements that the origins remake gave us and Final Fantasy VII because \"New Threat Mod\" has made the materia system so much better (ha, ok, so VII was a fake out :p I like the game a lot). It isn't that the originals were bad, they just got enhanced years after they were made. This is something that many other forms of entertainment actually can't replicate to the same degree and should be celebrated. Legend of Zelda Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are two more games that have become unworthy over time, the Wii U HD remasters blow them out of the water and even have some QOL improvements that was a long time coming.\n\nA game that I think is Worthy that many wouldn't is Might No. 9 (steam). It's a great re-imagining of the classic series (I think many were expecting the X series) and it has some very distinct mechanics that you don't find elsewhere. I don't think this game is perfect, and I was let down a bit by it a bit, however it is worth your time to play it. Don't play the Wii U version though, now that is unworthy. Zelda II is another game that I find worthy that some may not, it has one of the most intricate battle systems for the NES and is still a challenging game to get through that I've seen make Dark Soul players cry (but keep coming back for more).\n\nSo, how do you rate games or how do you think games should be rated?",

For example, if you have 30 bullets total and a full clip has 10 bullets, then when you reload a clip that has 5 bullets left, your total bullet count is still 25 when in reality it should be 20.  I think an added element of strategy would be forcing the player to choose between reloading an entirely empty clip (and therefore losing some bullets but ensuring a full clip for next encounter) vs. reloading an entirely empty clip (and therefore retaining the ammo count but risking the reload time during your next enemy encounter).

        "text": "Some of the very first games that I've played had this feature, The Sims 1, Vice City and Pokemon Silver all had systems in place that allowed an in-game clock to tick and make day turn into night and vice versa, something that is taken for granted in modern open-world games.\n\nAlways the atmosphere of the game has a drastic change, Vice City's neon lights turning on during the night made the game world feel vastly different than during day-time. The Sims' nighttime was usually very quiet, with all of your Sims sleeping, time passed by rapidly, until a criminal, ghost or raccoon appeared which never failed to scare the absolute shit out of me because of the music that played. \n\nSometimes nighttime can make the game itself change in various ways, a simple example would be when different Pokemon are available on a certain route at night. Minecraft was pretty significant in how much things changed as darkness made monsters spawn and you had to put torches on the walls so it can light up the surroundings.\n\nDarkwood on the other hand, is all about the day/night cycle. Day is spent exploring the haunted woods around your hideout and collecting as much resources as you can find and then frantically sprint back towards your hideout the moment the sun starts to set, because when night falls you have to barricade yourself inside your own home, huddle in the corner and ready your weapon for when the unknown footsteps down the hall eventually breaks down your barricade or the furniture starts moving by itself again.\n\nThe funny thing is that it isn't day OR night in themselves that are the most hard-hitting parts of Darkwood, it's the short moments between them, sunset and sunrise. Looking out of your barricaded windows, watching the light slowly drain away and the music intensifying, you sit there in anticipation, wondering just what you're going to deal with tonight. But Morning? Morning is where Darkwood distinguishes itself from all other horror games, because morning, in contrast to the other parts of this game, decides to soothe the player. Time is paused, meaning you have all the time in the world to manage your resources, rearrange your furniture and fix your barricades all while a very soothing yet-melancholic melody very reminiscent of the calmer Silent Hill themes palys in the backround, all of this ends of course when you leave your hideout, then the clock start ticking and the frantic search for resources to last another day starts again.\n\nDarkwood isn't purely a horror game, but also a survival game that does away with the annoying need to constantly eat and drink (because you're in a Blair-Witch project inspired forest anyways), Darkwood is entirely about overcoming whatever is thrown at you, regardless of how terrifying things get, everything is manageable. It doesn't throw scary things at you just for the sake of being scary, but to prove that you CAN survive the night.\n\nDarkwood was definitely the most underrated game of 2017, and it may look kind of underwhelming when you see a static screenshot of it but the visuals are great, it reminds me a lot of the way Diablo 2 looked (but this may just be me), the visuals are only a small part of the experience, IMO the sound and gameplay are the best part of this game.\n\nIt's also really cheap and I got 45 hours out of it, so there's that. Best survival game I've ever played, because it realizes survival is about surviving, not just collecting a bunch of stuff, building a giant castle and calling it a day.",

But it's the fact that there are so much more areas of improvement for Nintendo that really bugs me. We all have our issues with xbox one, ps4, pc, etc. But I feel as though the issues with Nintendo and their consoles are enough to make it fall out of competition to be a \"main console. \n\nFirstly their online infrastructure (or lack thereof) is an abomination. We absolutely 100% need a messaging system on a console released in 2017. Its unacceptable. The complete lack of some integral, basic features is jarring. \n\nSecondly their actual hardware seems.....very cheap. Switches are warping now. And things such as the kickstand being a flimsy joke and the USB port on bottom......I understand that the switch is ambitious but these things make it seem like the quality control department of Nintendo is lacking when it comes to hardware. Can we swap a little bit of the plastic for some metal?\n\nOverall I feel like Nintendo gets away with things that Microsoft and Sony would be crucified for.",

        "text": "Many games have mechanics such as a \"sprint\" function with which the player can sprint for a limited time; doing so depletes their stamina bar, so they can only sprint for a certain distance before they run out of stamina and have to wait a short while for it to regenerate before they can sprint again. Another action like this is a special attack that also requires stamina (e.g. Unturned where doing a more powerful melee attack costs stamina as well).\n\nThere are also games that require stamina to do many core game actions - Dark Souls is one example, in which attacking, blocking, dashing and most actions require stamina and you cannot do those actions without having enough stamina. It could be said that this adds challenge to the game by not allowing the player to \"spam\" abilities, and forcing them to think carefully about which abilities to use given how much stamina they currently have.\n\nSome games (like certain platformers) may also use energy/stamina for special moves like jumping further and teleporting, for the same reasons as above, as well as to potentially reward the player by trading energy for a special power.\n\nWhich games have the best use of stamina systems for in-game actions like sprinting, attacking and jumping? How can stamina systems be best used to enhance the gameplay experience and not feel restrictive to the player?",
