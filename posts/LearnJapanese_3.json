Why not spend time from now and then checking your pronunciation with your tutor or friend? \n\nFor whatever reason, people stress on these two topics far beyond what is needed. \n\nEspecially after vaccines were available, those who for fear of catching corona avoided preventive medicine or stopped exercising or stopped their kids from going to school were injuring their health, not helping it. \n\nThose who obsess about pitch accent lessons, and therefore have less time to work on proper Japanese pronunciation, phrasing, vocabulary, grammar would usually be suboptimal in increasing their ability to communicate.",

I’m confused on after this though I might invest in a book currently looking at Japanese to zero to learn kanji/develop more skills in katakana and hiragana. I also learned immersion is good so I’m wondering if just watching Japanese easy anime is good enough to get atleast a little immersion? Anyways I wanted y’all’s thoughts and opinions on this please comment what y’all would recommend.",

        "text": "Hello! My wife and I created [uchisen.com](https://uchisen.com) a few years ago. It's a website for learning kanji with mnemonics and her hand-drawn images. Since then, life has gotten in the way of her creating images at the speed she used to. However, we finally figured out a way to give visual learners a way to learn all kanji without having to wait for her to draw more pictures: now anyone can create and share kanji mnemonics and use the power of AI to generate images that match the stories.\n\nWe just released this free update and have loved seeing the stories and images others come up with. It really helps remember the mnemonics! Even when the images look a little goofy (you know, the way most AI images look at the moment) it honestly makes it easier to remember IMO. Just click on any kanji card you see and there should be a create button under the picture.\n\nPlease check it out, it's free and no payments/subscription are necessary! We love seeing the stories others can come up with and hope this can become a Japanese learning tool that everyone can enjoy. Also please send any feedback you have! Thanks, and happy learning :)\n\n[uchisen.com](https://uchisen.com)\n\n(This works perfectly fine on mobile but looks better on desktop and hasn't been added to the iOS app yet - but will be soon (hopefully!))",

As in the early stages of learning Japanese, people tend to pick up \"bad speaking habits\" and learning pitch accent later on would be harder because of those said \"bad habits.\" \n\nObviously there are many other reasons on why you might want to learn Pitch Accent early on. But my main point is this, learning that Pitch Accent exists and what it is, made me feel that it's super important to learn. However, is it really that important?\n\nDo you think Pitch Accent should **only** be learned if it aligns with your personal goals with Japanese? Or it should be something that everyone include into their studies?",

After self-teaching myself Korean for three months at the end of last year, I definitely enjoyed the process and was happy with my pace(2-3 hours everyday). However, I have not studied in three months(since Dec), primarily because of life obligations that distracted me. \n\nNow that I have time to learn and self-study again, I am debating if I should begin learning Japanese for a bit instead. \n\n* **Reason 1:** ***I want to try both languages before committing to one language to achieve fluency in.*** I am aware it’s recommended not to do both with an equal effort at the same time. \n* **Reason 2:** ***I watch a lot more anime than anything else***, and I believe the \"natural\" speaking exposure and familiarity would help (whereas listening to k-pop did not help with intonation at all lol, and I did feel “forced” to watch k-dramas and korean videos that I didn’t enjoy quite as much.)\n\n**So I guess my question is:**\n\n***Is it worth it to try learning Japanese when I already have a \"decent\" understanding of Korean?*** My gut is telling me \"yes, why not? it might be better for the long run to see what I have more passion in\" but at the same time, my head is saying \"after three months of learning Japanese, what if you forget all your elementary Korean and you have to start over again?\"\n\nAfter a three-month break, I already found myself needing to restudy some grammar and structure in Korean that I was once more familiar with, so I'm worried about where I'd be if I don't study in another three months.\n\nAny advice would be great, thanks! I'm planning on crossposting this to both subreddits. I'll also leave a comment with more on my learning journey if the details happen to help anyone, haha. Thanks!",

I enjoy both decks quite a bit, but I am way better with JLab. My reading kinda sucks at this point but my listening is decent as that’s what JLab focused on a lot, as well as my main form of immersion is through listening. I don’t think there’s any problem with this, but I am now struggling with recognizing words, even though I know their pronunciation. For example, the word 携帯. If I hear this word in a podcast, I instantly know that it is cellphone. I’m struggling with recalling what it is from seeing it, though. I can close my eyes for most Tango cards and know what they are, but I have a hard time recalling them from just reading. Is it just a matter of seeing it over and over again/is this a pretty normal occurrence? When I have mock conversations with myself I can recall words pretty decently, I just suck at seeing them and knowing the meaning from just that. Any tips?",

I know with Anki, you can make your own decks. I don't want to do that. It will take hours, days, with all the vocabulary. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I took two years of it in high school and two semesters of it in college, but recently took a break and I now want to jump back in.\n\nI did pretty well in high school, though it moved pretty slow so it wasn’t that hard. Got my hiragana and katakana down, as well as some very basic vocab and grammar. The college course was focused around “learning through performing”, which consisted more of memorizing and reciting scripts and less of actually breaking down and understanding the language, which really didn’t work for me. Between not having a clue what I was doing and the humiliation of messing up scripts in front of the class, was all I could do to keep up with the course, and I feel like my Japanese actually got worse throughout the year. It was demoralizing to the point that I had to take a break from the language.\n\nSo now I’m trying to figure out what to do. I want to get to the point that I listen to or read media, but I just don’t know where to start. I downloaded the wanikani Anki deck, I tried going through my old textbook, and I’m trying to be patient but I don’t think any of it is helping. Is there a more effective way I can go about this?",

        "text": "A little context: In the past I learned around 2k Kanjis and sth around 1k words. Then university life hit me, I had no time and forgot everything. After finishing university I took up studies again and learn via Anki and so far I've learned around 1k Kanjis and 1k words.\n\nThe problem: I already feel burned out from learning Kanji, it's getting more and more boring BUT I love learning new words and further working on my vocabulary. Is there a legitimate way to focus more on vocabulary and learn kanji next to it instead of vice versa?\n\nAlso on a smaller note, any recommended sites where you can work on learning japanese grammar? I read that Imabi is recommended, any experiences? \n\nGreatly appreciate every answer!",

This is how they said it in Japanese.\n\n\nどの性格の人がより第二言語を学びやすいか.\n\n\nI can't wrap my head around what より is doing in this sentence. For sure よりusage always throws my brain for a loop. I'm fine if the sentence contains both のほうが and より but for some reason a sentence with just より is always hard for me. \n\nWe chatted with another native Japanese speaker and they thought this sentence was pretty natural but neither could really explain the grammatical details.\n\nWe also came up with this sentence which is way easier for me to follow:\n\nどんな性格だったら第二言語を学びやすいか\n\nI hoping someone can give me a bit more insight into the use of より in the first sentence and I'd like to hear opinions on how often this type of より usage is in everyday Japanese.\n\nThanks",

(I use a list of core 6k words in Anki 10 words per day at a time, sometimes an extra 10 if I'm up to it).\n\nI also watch LOTS of Youtube on grammar and other topics, and I've tried using SatoriReader a bit. OH and for Kanji I use an app that teaches you around 2300 Kanji by JLPT level.\n\nMy problem is I'm having trouble coming up with a good working routine. I'm not sure how to immerse myself well. (I've tried watching some anime with no subs, and I am playing a game I really like in full JP). I want to develop my reading skill a lot at the moment and go from there. Any advice?",
