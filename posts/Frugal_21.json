But this SUV I think is at the point it's too much and honestly i never liked it anywyas. Just something a family member hand me down that seemed good at first but keeps havign issues.. This next bill on fixing a bad power steering leek is going to cost 1100, which means it'll probably be about 2k when they find the real problems in it. The mechanic said given the miles on it(i really dont drive much btw just how i got it) it's probably time to get rid of it. \n\nAnother problem is my aunt let that SUV go and the paint peeled off it, and i made the mistake of not seeing if I could fit in the car before buying it, it's actually a bit small for my 6 4' body lol. The paint thing i sort of could deal with but i'm a sub teacher and I sort of feel embarrassed drying that at work now. Both things sort of drove me to despise the thing. \n\n While im cheap at certain things I don't care about ,like driving, t I sort of think it's time to get rid of the thing and take the L.\n\nI was just wondering what is the best way to get a cheap car?  I was searching around and looked online for some cheap vehicles and called a few places and sort of like scourer everywhere for that caar under 5k miles and not over 5k in cost. I found a few but then a few places started warning me that there is usally something wrong with these cars. IDK i really dont have much car buying exp tbh as I always got the cheap handme downs from my family and they just upgrade their car afterward,but w they dont have any of atm hehe. \n\nShopping around i made the mistake of calling a super center. The guy is pushing me like to go up a lot lol. A lot of the cars that are under 4k and have okay milage on them have the paint peeling off them(IDK if i can do that again lol, I actually sub teach and feel embarrassed driving that in). Also like my aunt maybe the paint peeling off might be a sign the owner didn't give a hoot about the car.\n\nAnyways Any tips for a car buying noob?:)",

I am open to the hypothesis I keep hearing that iPhones last longer so in the end you break even or it is even cheaper without the hassle of changing your phone every 2 years. This is especially given that they have cheaper options, like the SE or buying either the 11, 12 or 13.\n\nHowever, I am not sure how true this is. Do Android really last that little? My most recent experience was a Xiaomi Note 8 Pro bought 3 years ago and honestly everything is fine but the battery started draining pretty rapidly after 2nd year mark. I have borne it since WFH but now with some usage if I forget to charge it dies and I miss my alarm the next day.\n\nThat being said, I am a bit confused as many permutations exist and some information needs to be considered, such as:\n\n\\- Is it better to just recycle cheap Xioamis every 2 years? \n\n\\- Is the correct middle ground a \"more quality\" brand like Samsung/Google mid-range options? ... but that is barely cheaper than an iPhone 13 mini or SE.\n\n\\- What about a \"more quality\" or Chinese android + replacing batteries? Will that negate the \"longer lasting\" aspect of iPhones?\n\nNote: You can assume that the subjective thing of \"usability\" of UI etc. doesn't matter too much because I can get used to everything.\n\nI would really appreciate it if someone helps me cut trough the noise and understand which one is the best option for me.

They really, really want you to be a persistent subscriber (buy for a year, save 25%) - but that is a false savings.\n\nIf you pick whichever streaming service has something fun on right now (maybe The Last of Us) - subscribe to that service when all the episodes have dropped.   Keep the service for a month and then switch to a different service.\n\nThe services usually have a dozen marquee shows per year - so when you do subscribe again you have a lot of great content to watch.\n\nYou can go from $100 per month ($50 Internet plus $50 services) to $65 per month ($50 internet plus $15 services).    That’s $420 per year saved and you won’t miss the unsubscribed services.  \n\nIf you are still paying for CableTV - think about the sports streaming services during the season of interest.    So - if you like the NFL - put Hulu into your mix only during football.\n\nIf you cancel Cable TV as well (which you should) - you can save $50-100 more per month depending on your plans. \n\nBecause many subscribe to Amazon Prime - that means you always have two video subscriptions at any time.

My goal is to help individuals achieve financial freedom through frugal living and smart financial planning.\n\nOn my blog, I cover a wide range of topics related to personal finance, including budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management.

Thing is it's normally 86$ plus tax, and I got it down to $17.71 after I got an Amazon card, used a coupon, and used a Cashback bonus on a credit card. I realized that the reason it's taking forever is I likely angered someone there by doing that. I didn't realize until today how much of a cheapskate move it was to double up stuff like that. I want to be frugal, but I don't want to a cheap jerk either. What do I do about this and how do I avoid this behavior as soon as possible?",

Let me tell you folks - I got a *beautiful* wooden chest of drawers for $45.   \n\nNow if one thing’s for certain, I don’t know shit about furniture, but my mother  tells me the “dove tail” drawers make it a good buy.  I totally did that on purpose.  \n\nProblem is they just smell *old.*  I don’t know how to describe it other than it just reminds me of cleaning out my grandmother’s closet.  God rest her soul.   It’s not a *bad* smell, but it isn’t pleasant, and I’d like my clothes to at least have a modicum of freshness.  \n\nIs there a way to get rid of this smell?  I tried dabbing essential oils on a few cotton balls and placing them around the drawers.  While it covered up the smell, once the lemony scent went away on the clothes, the old drawer smell came back.  (As in my clothes would start to smell like old furniture again throughout the day.)  Do you fellow thrifters have any advice?",

I thought I was doing alright because I was making my own meals and such, but recently I've been given a restricting diet by my doctor to try and figure out what might be causing some severe stomach problems I'm having.\n\nIn other words I can't have foods that are considered spice, citrus, anything tomato (tomato based or otherwise), caffeine, chocolate, or anything severely aromatic. I don't really have a specific list because it would be very long, and it's just a best judgement call sort of thing for the spicy and aromatic foods. On top of that I might be lactose intolerant so I have to be wary of that and shouldn't have lactose in large amounts.\n\n**If you don't want to read the ramble below I'm just looking for recipes and foods that follow the restrictions but taste good (and are budget friendly)**\n\nI'm trying to find recipes and foods I can have that taste good and are at least relatively good for me. This has been very hard because I really love spicy food as well as tomatoes, I've had to completely cut out most pastas and have avoided Hispanic based food like the plague. 😔\nWith how much of a restriction on what I should eat I haven't been eating much and that's really not good, but nothing I can eat really tastes good. I used to be able to just tough it up and eat things but once I moved out my brain and body don't feel the need to eat which has made it difficult to even remember to sit down and eat. Not to mention I struggled to remember to eat even when I could eat the foods I enjoyed. It's even harder when I don't have food to look forward to and I've been surviving fine on whatever I ate yesterday for a snack.\n\nNeedless to say I would appreciate any help anyone is willing to offer.",

        "text": "I have kids in the house with data plans through verizon. Plus I have a dedicated land line for internet. Not a phone land line, like the old days. Just a basic internet cable that costs $80/mo. \n\nCouldn't I turn off the internet and tell the kids to use their Verizon hotspots to power their Disney+ and Netflix or would that be too much draw on their bandwidth?\n\nI mostly have it for me because I work from home selling real estate. But I, too, could probably use my own cellular hotspot for internet connection, right?\n\nWhat would be the potential issues if I canceled the internet and told everyone to use their hotspots?",
