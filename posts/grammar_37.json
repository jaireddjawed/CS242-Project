It took a screaming 12-year-old to have me realize: kids are people, too. \n\n3.) It‚Äôs not just my sister. I used to think all people were the same, making it hard to listen to what they had to say.\n\n4.) The way they dressed and spoke‚ÄîI estimated people like a number. \n\n5.) People put the word ‚Äúweird‚Äù next to her name so often, it made Oranger her last.\n\n6.) I said ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù and our coversations began from there. \n\n7.) I kept thinking, ‚ÄúWhat does she want to hear?‚Äù or, ‚ÄúWhat would make her feel better?‚Äù\n\n8.) I stopped thinking about my own replies; she never asked for my advice in the first place. \n\n9.) For her feelings to get through to me, all I needed to do was stop thinking for a second and sympathize; to sink into her words, rather than the ones floating around in my brain.\n\n10.) It‚Äôs something so simple, yet so important: listening.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read, if you did!! I looked stuff up online, and now I‚Äôm doubting everything I‚Äôve revised. Sentences #1, #3, #5, #6, #8, and #9 are the ones I am most worried about. Please help me out! \n\n",

The reason was that I was too shit‚ÄîI allegedly missed clear grammar mistakes and overedited. The company doesn't give detailed feedback, so I'm trying here. I'm posting the text rather than a Google Docs file because I'd like to see the changes. Here we are:\n\nSection 1\n\nA community is a group of people with some common properties, a subset of a network whose users are densely connected and have similar attributes, e.g., they like to play badminton or their research area is similar. In social networks, individuals will form various communities according to their interests.  Although the structure of social networks will change with time,  communities are relatively stable. \n\nIn this area, the main issue is how to detect the communities with high influence in a social network. Researchers have proposed many methods, mainly including links and attributes. They have detected communities through social links, content (39-41), node attributes (42), sentiment topics (43), and others (44). The relevant literature will be analyzed as follows:\n\nSection 2\n\nFractured geological formations are ubiquitous throughout the world and are of interest in a number of contexts: (1) reservoir exploitation for water supply; (2) contamination from subsurface waste repositories; (3) petroleum reservoir exploitation; (4) geothermal reservoir exploitation and heat storage; (5) mining and mineralization processes (in situ leaching and location of ore bodies); (6) geotechnical applications (including effects on underground storage reservoirs, tunnels, and other structures); and (7) deeper Earth systems, such as earthquakes and ocean floor hydrothermal venting (1, 2). In the field of petroleum reservoir exploitation, there is an increasing amount of research into fractured oil and gas reservoirs because these occupy a considerable proportion of attention (3-7).\n\nSection 3\n\nGlobal change pressures have increased the prevalence of forest fires in western North America (1‚Äì3). Therefore, a better understanding of the connection between resulting perturbations in environmental factors and ecosystem processes, such as decomposition, will be vital to modeling ecosystem responses in the wake of such disturbances (4‚Äì7). Microbial production of extracellular enzymes (EEA) involved in decomposition is regulated by the quantity and quality of substrates, which can change significantly after forest fires, although other factors such as moisture and pH are known to impact EEA as well (8‚Äì10). In particular, fire disturbances dramatically alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools, pH, and the water holding capacity of soil (11,12), which may all continue to change through succession. These factors may thus affect microbial investment in both C and N, targeting decomposition enzymes across short time scales of ecosystem recovery (possibly for months).\n\nSection 4\n\nMoreover, IoT portable devices communicate with each other and thus require an enormous amount of memory to store and process data. The memory requirement in IoT depends upon the applications related to the market. For instance, in the case of a huge amount of data storage and information-handling for a long period of time, high-density memory, such as DRAM or Flash, is required. On the other hand, for high data transfer rate systems, fast SRAM memory is necessary, where a high clock frequency is essential to communicate between IoT devices. Therefore, SRAM is always preferred as cache memory due to its faster response. Moreover, the robustness of such memory systems respective to the variations in process-voltage-temperature (PVT) values of metal oxide semiconductor devices (MOS) and power efficiency are two of the most important design constraints (4). Per the literature, more than 40 percent of active energy is consumed due to current leakage in modern high-performance processors (6,7). Moreover, most of the time, a large number of SRAM cells used in present generation on-chip cache memory stands in a hold state where leakage power dominates dynamic power. Thus, leakage reduction has become the imperative concern in SRAM memory design.\n\nEDIT: Someone thought it was best to include the original text, so here it is:\n\nSection 1\n\nCommunity is a group of people with some common properties.

Usually translator helps me out but this time it doesn't. So here is the thing. I have a phrase and I need an advice which time will be right for that sentence. Present Continuous or Present Perfect Continuous? There are two variants of mine:\n\n1. *We're dying the whole our life.*\n2. *We've been dying the whole our life.*\n\nSo I know that Present Continuous (PC) is used when the action's being done at some time period, like *he was working all summer.* But Present Perfect Continuous (PPC) is used when I do know the length of time period and the moment when it's ended right? So here is the thing that messes me up.\n\nA process of dying is a process of getting closer to your death isn't it? So when the baby's born he's getting closer to his death with every second he lives. So we can say he's dying can't we?\n\nAnd here's the thing. The end of this action is death. And actually we know when this action will be ended. When we died. Even if we don't know when it'll be exactly we know the consequent end of this process. So should I use PPC if I know the moment when the action from sentence will stop or this moment is still unknown for me if I don't know exactly when it's happen so I should use PC?\n\n‚Äã\n\nI intuitively prefer the PC but I wanna see which one the native speaker would say :)\n\n‚Äã\n\n*PS, it's a little depressive maybe but it is what it is :D*",
