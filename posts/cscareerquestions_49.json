        "text": "Hi folks! \n\nI work in a Fortune 500 as a junior software QE. I deal mostly with writing automation tests with cypress, some manual testing, Jenkins and deployments through internal toolings. I’ve been working my first tech job for about 7 months and have been rattled by the recent lay offs at my company. I was lucky enough to stay but I heard from the friend of mine who is the significant other of a higher up that I barely made the cut. If there are another round of layoffs I should be prepared.\n\nMy goal is to work as a frontend developer but somehow ended up in QE as my first job. I have solid HTML and JavaScript foundations but I’ll be honest that I’ve really slipped on my CSS, React and general frontend practices. I have an outdated Svelte project as my only portfolio piece. \n\nMy background is that I’m a career changer in my late 20s with only an associates in computer science degree and a non-related bachelors in music. \n\nWhat are some strategies for upskilling my frontend practices while leveraging my 9-5 as a QE? Or just protecting myself in general\n\nTech stack I’m thinking about\nHtml\nCSS - tailwind?\nReact\nWebpack\nNode/express\n\nI know the market for juniors are brutal right now, I want to be as prepared as I can be, any advice would be really appreciated!",

I have received a lot of positive feedback from my manager and other teams, who have adopted several of my projects/ideas into their own teams. \n\nHowever, my team itself has quite frankly been an awful experience. This isn't the whole team, there are just a select few male coworkers that are making my life hell. If I present an idea, they are immediately hostile to it. It doesn't matter if they came to me asking for help, they will say my solution is wrong (and then later after exhausting all other options will admit it worked). When deciding on how to move forward on a project/technology solution they will immediately shoot down my ideas. Just this week I pitched an idea and it was shot down. Then later in a week one of these male colleagues re-presented this option as his own, literally hitting all the same points almost word for word when I presented the option, and it was immediately adopted. \n\nThis has become a major issue because 1. Things that are blatantly important are shot down because I brought them up and 2. I was assigned to lead a project which has been screwed over because of this hostility. I can recommend something as simple as \"this is an important data store so it needs to be backed up\" and this will either devolve into an argument or the work will not be completed. Same with attempting to lead a project, tickets will be closed without any work being completed and meetings will be derailed to alter the conversation at hand.\n\nThe same people who have caused this hostility have also caused several major outages, creating a negative perception of our team. Some of these being caused by the exact same issues in their code I have called out as previously being the root cause. This is ruining my ability to work on what I want to, because I have to assist with outages all the time and it takes way longer than it needs to thanks to everything I say being questioned or disregarded. But if I don't join, they will spin in circles or log off and stop working on it which extends the outage even more and makes our team look worse. All I can get from my manager regarding this is \"he's working on it but it takes time\". It has gotten progressively worse, both hostility wise and stability wise, and I am at the end of my rope. I think my manager knows I'm on the verge of quitting and has been making explicit promises now to get the shitshow under control. \n\nAny options for me to save this? I don't believe my manager is going to be able to actually stop any of this because it's been going on over a year now and it's just getting worse. I would prefer to be able to keep my job and get rid of the people ruining it, but I know that's not always realistic.",

I've been working there for a few weeks now but have mostly been focused on watching trainings, going to meetings, and sitting at my desk waiting for others to respond to emails or teams messages. I haven't even had a chance to look at the code base.\n\nThat being said I've been quite nervous that when I start getting tickets and helping out, I won't be able to live up to there minimal expectations. I've been trying to do things like code academy and watching YouTube videos but that has made me feel even worse. For example, the Java lesson I was doing today had me struggling to create getters and setters as well as using objects correctly without looking things up. Now I haven't used Java in about 2 years but I feel like they will expect that to be fundamental knowledge. Other than school most of my other experience is creating cool scripts in python. So I dont have much experience working on programs with multiple classes,  connecting front ends to backends, creating apis, etc. Which makes me all the more worried.  It also doesn't help that I can barely understand what anyone is talking about in these meetings since most of it is high level design work or specifics about a code base I've never seen before.\n\nIs this something everyone experiences or do I need to sit down and start practicing these concepts for hours a week when I'm not working.",

        "text": "Originally, I thought of suggesting a union, but legally, unions have been nerfed beyond all belief. (I hope they recover someday, but it's going to be a long struggle). \n\nIn the interim, we, as as developers &amp; engineers, have highly useful skills that we wish to use to make money. As an early millineal, I've gotten hit by each recession as \"the expendable new girl\" on the team and the target for the layoffs... every... effing... time. I've been laid off 10 times in 23 years. That's *way* too much. Sure, pays been good each time, and unemployment usually covers the gaps, but the stress of having to job hunt every few years just isn't worth it. I *may* be an outlier, but honestly, I doubt I'm all that special in that regard.\n\nFrequent layoffs, unreliable (even if good) income, managers who have no clue how to split up tasks that pander to strengths of their developers instead of their weaknesses, the list goes on. \n\nTo that end, after each lay-off, I've played with the idea in my head... we're experts at engineering solutions, so can we engineer a solution to our own predicaments? \n\nThe idea I have is less union (for the previously mentioned reason), and more like a guild. We, as developers, create a developer's guild as a non-charitable non-profit. It'd be a co-op where we all receive a portion of the guild's profits and shoulder a portion of the operating expenses. The guild would contract to other businesses, and the business would split pay between the guild &amp; the worker. When any of don't have work, we'd instead follow an internal guild model similar to Valve's, where people need to work, but they get to choose what they work on (including new things to work on). Products created by the guild would have the profits evenly shared, with bonuses going to those who worked on it based on the days they dedicated to it. People would also be able to offer (or request) guild member to guild member training; generally with a low barrier to entry. \n\nWho's a fan, and would this be a smart idea? Do you think it'd take off? Has anything like this been made already and I just haven't heard about it?",

But lately I’ve been looking at posts about such jobs and I’ve found out that those skills are not enough and the market is kinda saturated, I saw that skills like Cloud: AWS Azure are more likely to help. \n\nSo I wanted to ask if I want to learn something and in some months from now (summer e.g.) to be able to make some money of it (not much, like 500 €/$ per month) as a freelancer (I guess?), where should I look into?",

I'm at a year and a half right now, and it seems like everyday I change my mind. Unfortunately, I haven't made the most out of this job so far because of that (completing my work but not going out of my way to learn beyond that)\n\nWhat makes it desirable is also it's downfall: it's a little bland. I can leave work at 12pm and no one cares because they do it too. Of course, there's the expectation of completing a sprint and attending meetings, but otherwise no rules or micromanaging. At the same time, I never thought I would say this, but the culture is a drag. Like I said, no one really cares. People get their work done but there's no passion to improve things, no projects to get excited about. Don't even get me started on how awkward the socials are.\n\nI would love some opinions on this, I don't want to be making a wrong decision\n\nReasons to stay:\n\n* Work on backend / platform\n   * I like to think what I'm working on is in demand?

There is also a considerable age gap\n* The usual stuff from switching companies (better pay, new experience, fresh start, etc)\n   * Idk if it's fair to be it's own reason, but I went through a significant depressive episode last year, part of me just wants a new chapter\n* I kind of want a mixed remote situation\n* The product is something rather obscure, can be hard to understand use cases or even care\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

There were 2 other interns, and the boss was relying on us to ship a product. I was the most productive out of the interns. (One of them was even sleeping on the job, and the boss didnt seem to care)\n\nI finished my full time position and got the paycheck, then texted my boss I was quitting. My boss was very upset, he tried to offer more flexible hours but I refused and he said I can't just leave because I haven't finished the number of hours I was supposed to.\n\nI want to have this internship on my CV but I'm worried about future companies calling and obviously I will get badmouthed. Should I be concerned about this, or should I just quit?",

The recruiter asked me if I have any experience with networking and if I know the very basics of what a networking operations center does. \n\nI answered those questions with some details (only about two sentences each since it was an email) explaining my experience and giving definitions and some other basic info about NOC. A friend looked over my email afterwards and said I should have just said “yes” and not have gone into any detail about it. The recruiter usually replies fairly quick but after I sent that email I didn’t hear back. And the today I got the rejection email. \n\nSo I’m looking for advice. Those were the only two questions I was asked so I have to assume the decision was made based on that. How should I have handled the questions to not get myself rejected?",

But web dev kind of  scares me as it's quite popular and many do it, idk if that's stupid of  me to think like that but supply and demand. There are more web devs  than AI/ML coders I'm sure. With web dev, to me, MERN stack looks very  appealing, but the problem is I don't have any expertise in any of it.\n\n1. How good is MERN stack?\n2. How does it compare to the scope of AI/ML?\n3. I have to apply for internships this summer and I don't know what to choose.\n4. I have around 2 years left in finishing my graduate degree.\n5. How good is it for internships?\n6. Difference in stipend for both? Is it big? (for freshers)\n7. How much will it take to build a competent level of expertise in those fields?\n8. Can I be industry-ready in time?",

My Qs-\n\nQ1. I was told that I would get dev work as well. Should I take it even though I am being offered Support Engineer role?\n\nQ2. Now I know there is a learning curve involved while picking up a project. The engineers with only dev work will do all the dev task and I may not get any and would be stuck in support. Am I making sense here? Can this be avoided?\n\nQ3. I had only 1 technical round. This seems a red flag given i appeared for 3 in the current org. Is this a red flag or could you spot any red flags above?\n\n\nMy HR interview is in few days. Any questions that I should ask the HR? Please let me know! Thanks, if you read till here :)",

((Maybe create a podcast to achieve this?)\n\nConnect with:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People who use the same tech stack\n* Potential employers\n* Possible mentors\n\nMake sure to connect with them on LinkedIn, so they can follow your progress in the next steps.\n\nBe an active participant in different online communities related to your tech stack.\n\n### 3: Learn the tech stack\n\nFind a tutorial for building a project with the technology stack while using good coding practices.\n\n### 4: Document yourself making a portfolio using the technology stack\n\nFind mediums where you’ll post about the progress of your projects for your portfolio and things you’re learning (Blog, YouTube, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.)\n\nWhenever you solve an issue, search for other people having the same problem online and help them solve it.\n\n**Which projects to make for your portfolio?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Consider making or contributing to open-source projects\n* Make a Software Product you can sell\n* Freelance (make sure you are allowed to show the work in your portfolio)\n\n### 5: Create online presence &amp; marketing materials (Resume, LinkedIn, Github, personal website)\n\nLearn about marketing &amp; selling, so you know how to sell yourself to potential employers… (Create a brand for yourself)\n\nOptimize each of these marketing materials:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Resume\n* LinkedIn\n* Github\n* Personal portfolio website\n* Google your name and see what comes up\n\nMention the courses you’ve completed &amp; the portfolio you’ve created in previous steps.\n\nConsider which people could be your references or give letters of recommendation.\n\nAfter you’ve done everything you can do yourself, pay an expert to make your marketing material EVEN better!\n\n### 6: Find the best resources for staying up to date on new technologies in your field.\n\nSubscribe to the best YouTube channels, newsletters, etc.\n\n### 7: Improve interviewing skills\n\nResearch &amp; prepare for the most common:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Behavioral questions\n* Technical questions\n\nDo practice interviews with a friend.\n\n### 8: Apply for jobs\n\nIf you’ve really optimized your marketing material previously, then recruiters/hiring mangers should be CHASING you! (Outbound hiring)\n\nOtherwise, you’ll have to use some of these strategies (ranked according to success rate):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ask your network if they know of any jobs (only 20% of jobs are listed… the rest are filled through referrals)  \n   * Go directly to the CEOs or hiring managers instead of HR.\n* Network with people in the companies you want to join\n* Contact small companies that don’t post jobs and inquire about any potential opportunities\n* Start doing freelance software engineering work, and hope one of my clients wants to hire me permanently for a remote job.\n* Applying directly on a company website is more likely to feed into their ATS system\n* Work with a recruiter\n* Apply to regular jobs and ask if they can be done remotely (I think remote job boards are too competitive)\n* Apply to jobs through remote job boards (really competitive)\n\nDisclaimer: I’m just some random Software Engineer trying to make a plan for myself based on the research I’ve done.\n\nI would LOVE for people to make suggestions on how the plan can be improved.

I was working on fixing some build errors till 3 hours after working hours. By the time I was done the person that I was asked to coordinate with was being shown as last seen an hour ago. I contacted another manager for deployment and he told me to ignore his request and to sign off now and since the next deployment was to go first thing in the morning I did sign off but..\ni woke up today with an angry email from the PM, an email which had a lot of senior management in the cc.\nI have three years of total experience including 6months with this current client.  I realise that I should have communicated to the PM even when i found that the other person has probably signed off for the day. \nI apologised on that mail too..not sure how to de-escalate the situation. I fear I might get fired since I heard that other employees working for this client were asked to let go even after a single mistake.",

Of course I tried to adhere to DRY etc., but it's rough at a lot of edges (was in my apprenticeship).\n\nAnd the other one is a full blown enterprise serverless backend/frontend crossplattform app with ~30k lines of code, terraform setup in GCP, with machine learning (I.e. stable diffusion), auto scaling GPU etc.\nAlso this is not that great of a code, as you can assume, hammering that out as a PoC in the beginning, and suddenly taking 8 hours of your day on top of your normal workday.\n\nI am unsure about open sourcing them, as I fear them shining a bad light on my skills. (I love to do, what I want to do - tests are none of that, and in work I'm a professional, i.e. mostly another person, focusing TDD etc.). \n\nI do a great job, and I've a good career till now. I've only got good feedback and my CV is shining also, (1.1 bachelor degree, which is nearly perfect, no interruptions).\n\nSo. Can I open source them? Or will it hurt my career? :/",

Mostly for mid-level, 3-5 YOE type software engineering positions. Out of the 21 I have jotted down, I have done one technical coding challenge. One. A single one. And it wasn't even for one you'd expect, like a Fortune 100 or 500 company.\n\nWhat are your experiences with this? Is this an accidental selection bias on my end? Just anecdotal? Or have places begun to stop directly copying what \"high tier talent\" FAANG like companies do in their hiring practices if its not necessary? Very interesting is all, I even got up to an offer at an entertainment streaming service company without ever having to write a line of code in front of them.\n\nMaybe this is a junior/entry vs mid-level interviewing experience thing.

On average how much % of your pay cheque goes towards it?\n\nPlus if you're living in expensive states like SF or NY, you really gotta be making a filthy amount to make a decent living? Companies pay you the most there but does your net income feel sufficient enough though? Since the pandemic, a lot of people have moved out of those areas to at least be able to afford decent housing and there are a lot of tech workers among those people too.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, on a TN visa you have like 2 months to find a new gig and with all these lays off happening of late, it honestly does sound like a lack of peace of mind.

On indeed I look at the statistics and see that hundreds of people are applying for the same job.  \n\nI had a professional resume writer revamp my resume and since then I've been getting way more attention from recruiters, but nothing has stuck yet.  No interview offers.  I have a BS degree and a few projects too.  Is there a better place to look for jobs online?",

        "text": "Hi. I'm looking for my first new college grad role right now. I've been applying to research engineer, ML engineer and data science roles.\n\nCredentials:\n\n1. I have a BS and MS in ECE (focus in machine learning) from a top 10 school, good grades\n2. 4 internships, 2 in semiconductors, 2 in tech\n3. Interesting post-grad award (don't want to dox myself)\n4. No publications or substantial projects outside school/internship\n\nFor the past year of school, I wanted to get into ML research in big tech, or a company like OpenAI, Deepmind, etc... Unfortunately, big tech jobs are frozen right now, and the whole world has discovered these AI companies, so this dream may be put on hold. I've gotten some interviews with cool startups in related areas, but failed a lot of coding screens (before I realized I needed to grind leetcode).\n\nAnyway, I've been graduated for \\~2 months now, and am feeling antsy to start work. \n\nI had a good interview for a data science role in an academic lab (not EECS) that is indirectly related to what I want to work on longer term. It sounds like there would be a lot of independent python coding, data analysis and opportunities for publications. Location is desirable, and university is good (top 15).\n\nSalary is capped at \\~$85k, which is lower than I made as an intern, and lower than a job offer I got 3 years ago...\n\nMy dream is to work on a specific area of applied AI research, and I think this role could be a good intermediate role. But I wonder if another few months of grinding leetcode, and working on a side project could be the difference-maker into landing a FAANG ML job, cool AI startup or just a SWE role at a top company that would give me skills to land a better job in 2 years.  Also, this would mean a 2x difference in TC. \n\nThoughts, advice, opinions?",

COMPLETE WFH\n* Using outdated tools (Talend, Denodo, and newer qlik replicate), we will never use the cloud, and bringing in newer technologies is a fucking nightmare that takes months if not years.\n* They are currently offering a retention program. if you sign a 2 year agreeement to stay you will receive a 15K bonus immediately (pay back if you leave of course) 10k after taxes\n* Very good work-life balance and flexibility. I never feel stressed about work and have a well managed work load with an awesome manager and a good team.\n\nFuture opportunity:\n\n* Data engineer at a large freight company that does several things in the industry.\n* Pay would be 105-125k with an annual bonus ( not sure how much) , 4-5% 401k match I believe, this might be wrong. Fully paid medical benefits (not sure how good coverage is), and not sure how vacation is. Haven't received the full offer yet but they are sending it over soon.\n* They use the latest and greatest tools (aws, airflow, terraform, dbt, python ) just to name a few. They move fast and can whip up new POCs very quickly. I would like to have this skill set as I grow in my career\n* Might not have a good work-life balance, not sure how it is there. Boss wants people in most of the time but is okay with some remote work.\n* I would be concerned with my performance in my first year as there is so much to learn.\n* Team of 5-6 Data Engineers\n\nMy (25M) situation: We are currently doing well financially, my wife has a great job although her company is doing another round of layoffs she has been identified as a top performer and we don't really have concerns of her being affected. We both have 4 yrs exp. We recently just had a baby and she is 7 weeks old WITHOUT DAYCARE. We had our daycare lady leave the country so we are planning to WFH and take care of baby until October until she can get in. Will probably hire an in-home nanny? Really torn on what to do.\n\nTLDR: Have a cushy job now with a shitty toolset but offering more money, getting an offer for more money and a better toolset but would have to go into the office more with a baby at home.",
