Discrimination in America is illegal. A termination for discrimination discriminates thee whole person. This act violates our civil rights’ acts of 1968 resulting in the enumeration of the EEOC which all businesses of America have to abide by. Management of this business regardless if they are in  awareness terminated this employee for discrimination. Evident by the video shown in court today, the employee couldn’t fill a position that was already filled by management. This business was in poor management not poorly employed. Unfortunately for our employee his termination was discrimination, a mangers duty to direct her employees was not fulfilled, discriminating his whole person. Douglas has a skin color, hair color, race, and sexual orientation. The list goes on on how we could define my clients person. Civil rights protects this. You may be thinking to yourself this seems simple, well the solution wasn’t and took movement expanding 14 years.\n\nI’ll say it again…. Discrimination in America is illegal. Termination being directly defined “the power or quality of finely distinguishing.” The manger didn’t manage her floor, the employee doesn’t have the power to do that.

I have serious imposter syndrome and don’t think I belong in this position, but I do know that I made a true effort.  I started worrying about what opportunities I will have at my current school and decided to apply Early decision to a tier 1 program.  Now,  I have no idea if I will be accepted, but as I’ve been ruminating I feel like my priorities were a bit off and I should try to rescind my application before it is finalized (I’m waiting on a LOR).  I’m 35 and am seriously worried about the financial implications of losing a scholarship and paying more (and having to move to a different state).  I am striving towards a career in government, and while the pay sounds enticing in BigLaw, the mental health deterioration that seems to come with it is something I want nothing to do with.  Should I try to rescind my application?  Or will being at a t14 school be worth it for my career in the long run?  Im interested in legal aid or PD to start my career off so I know I won’t be making much to start off.  Help!",

        "text": "Hi! I'm struggling to understand what, precisely, one must be prepared to file with BOLE during the April EXAM REGISTRATION window. I know that there are a multitude of forms one needs to fill to gain admission to the bar, but I'm wondering if anything beyond the below and a $250 fee is needed to SIT for the EXAM:\n\n[As part of the online UBE application, you will be required to answer questions about your coursework at your ABA-approved law school that will generate your Certificate of Attendance form. You must be accurate when answering these questions and therefore should have a copy of your transcript in front of you when applying for the UBE. Once you complete these questions and timely pay the application fee, no action is needed on your part with respect to your eligibility as the next step in your eligibility falls on your law school to timely certify your Certificate of Attendance form. If you made an error in answering any question about your legal education, your law school will correct the error before certifying it. The deadline for your law school to certify this form on your behalf is February 1st for a February exam and June 15th for a July exam. Once the Board reviews and approves your Certificate of Attendance form, you will receive an email confirmation (you should not expect this email until after February 1st for a February exam and after June 15th for a July exam). If there is a problem with your eligibility, you likely will not be advised by the Board until on or after February 1st for a February exam or on or after June 15th for a July exam. Therefore, if you know of a deficiency in your eligibility (for example, you took longer than 60 months to complete your JD degree or you did not take a course in Professional Responsibility), you may petition the New York State Court of Appeals before receiving your ineligibility letter from the Board.](https://www.nybarexam.org/thebar/NYBarExamInformationGuide.pdf)\n\nMust the whole application for admission be filled as well? Affidavits from employers? 50 Pro Bono Hour certification? Etc., etc... \n\nMy confusion is grounded in mixed messaging. Any clarification would be extraordinarily helpful.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Having lurked this sub on and off for the past year, my perspective on the majority of the posts, especially relating to jobs and careers, skews in the negative. Lots of posts saying how they've struck out, can't find a decent internship, are depressed because of job prospects, etc. I can relate, and hopefully I can post my story in hopes that it will help those of you going through tough times.\n\nBit about me: 3.2 GPA, T100 school in the Midwest. Law review on a secondary journal. Nothing spectacular by any means.\n\nAs a 1L last year, I put 127 applications out. I had a few interviews, even made it to a few final round interviews, but nothing stuck. I was denied 126 times. That shit SUCKS, especially seeing classmates post on their LinkedIn's about offers at large firms and companies they've received. For me at least, this was the toughest part: thinking that I was inadequate and not good enough as compared to my peers. I battle these demons even to this day, and is something I continue to struggle with.\n\nI did, however, get one offer: an unpaid, 20-hours-per-week compliance internship at a small university. Because it was April and I was freaking out about not having a job, I accepted it. Even if it wasn't \"legal\" necessarily, the skills and job description (writing, research, etc.), I thought, would look beneficial on a resume. Better this than nothing, I thought. To make ends meet, I Instacarted grocery deliveries, doordashed, and hustled the best I could in my freetime, hoping in the long run it would pay off.\n\nSimilar story this past fall, and through the first few weeks of this semester. Still putting out apps, getting a few interviews but nothing sticking. I did a clinic in the fall, however, which really helped hone my research and writing skills. \n\nFast forward to spring and being persistent finally has paid off. Through OCI, received a paid, in-house internship opportunity at a large corporation near my school. Told the story to the interviewers, sold the skills and experiences I gained from the internship and clinic, as well as how I supported myself in the summer, and received the offer today. It is a dream internship opportunity for me that is going to open a lot of doors down the road.\n\nIf I can do it, everyone else on here can too. I'm nothing special or out of the ordinary, just someone who's not willing to accept no for an answer. Stick the course, believe in yourself, and I promise everything will work itself out.\n\nTDLR: know your worth, sell your strengths, and take opportunities that present themselves. In no time, the right opportunities for you will come, I promise! Happy to help in any way I can if interested and you're in a similar situation 🙂",

Disclose it and see what the C&amp;F committee has to say?\n\nI am totally panicking and willing to do whatever it takes to become an attorney. \n\nEven if the bar does question me about it, do you think they’d eventually pass me?

I’m hoping they will see past my prior mistakes. \n\nThanks all. Any opinions or similar experiences are welcomed.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI continue to have mixed emotions as I process being academically dismissed from a law school in Upstate NY. I initially chose to go to this law school because of the bar passage rate and a (small) scholarship. My first semester of 1L was not great– I got Cs in Contracts and Torts and Bs in Civ Pro(B-) and Legal Writing. Unfortunately, got vertigo and health anxiety for the entirety of my Spring Semester which resulted in Cs for Crim Law, Property, and, PR. In Addition, in Legal Writing, I got an A- and B Con Law. That semester was tough as it was difficult to get doctor's appointments and took even longer to see a therapist. The summer following the school dismissed me with the opportunity to petition, which was granted. However, the condition was that I could not receive any grade below a B for repeated courses and maintain a cumulative GPA above 2.5.\n\nThis past Fall semester, I changed everything about myself– l saw a therapist regularly, worked with a tutor, got enough sleep, got outlines, studied with a group of friends (no playing around), and had a good support system. As a result, my grades were \"great.\" I took a 2L level class that required a journal note and got a B+ and for the repeated courses, I received Bs in Civ Pro and Torts, but unfortunately a B- in Contracts. My GPA for this semester was 2.9 and my new cumulative GPA was in excess of 2.5.\n\nGiven this information, how do I move forward knowing that I actually improved? Most of the people in this forum mentioned that the Cs and Ds have led to their dismissal. But that's not my case per se. I truly do not want to give up! So any advice would be appreciated.\n\nPlus as I apply for paralegal jobs in the future, do I let employers know that I have gone to law school? Do employers look down on those with a law school history who are determined to try again?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "When analyzing an Individual Disparate Treatment claim under Title VII, when does the MDD Pretext framework apply vs Mixed Motives? Or is the answer to analyze under both? \n\nFor example: Employer claims that the Termination of an African American employee (adverse employment action, individual w/in protected class) was due to work performance (evidence on this is weak) but there were also racial comments made at various points (Thinking Reeves v. Sanderson’s Stray Remarks Doctrine here, evidence of this is concrete). \n\nLike my understanding is that in pretext cases, the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but not both, were the 'true' motives behind the decision whereas In mixed-motives cases, there is no one 'true' motive behind the decision.\n\nSo in the above example, it seems to me that either framework could apply even though Mixed Motives seems to be the obvious choice (e.g. performance issues are just pretext that a fact finder could rationally find to be not the actual reason). \n\nSo, again, should the analysis of this kind of fact pattern proceed under both frameworks and just point out the strength and weaknesses of providing each set of instructions to the jury? But what if it’s up on Summary Judgment? Do you still argue for both frameworks?",

So I’ll be able to school, not work and have time for other hobbies still. \n\nI’ll finally be finishing my undergrad in two years after chugging away at it since early twenties.  Currently a 4.0\n\nMy resume is pretty stacked. I’ve done things most people only read in books or see on movies. \n\nNot really a matter of if I get into a T14 school but which makes most sense geographically east, midwest, or west coast.  \n\nI know what it means to grind. Been doing it the last 15 years since first job in highschool and it’s a part of me unfortunately. I tell myself to take a break and chill but I enjoy being constantly stimulated.  I work full time, study real estate, landlord, school half time, renovating properties, and still find myself looking for the next thing to get better at. \n\nMy main want for even thinking about being a lawyer is to get super spun up on asset protection and to have a network to protect friends and family from the sue happy America.   I have the right mind for this type of work. Helped friends with real estate cases and have even personally sued a lawyer while representing myself in court.  I knew I had a knack when preparing and reading law and cases on my small claims cases. And it was fun establishing my argument and trying to beat it from the other persons shoes. I can be neurotic when it comes to researching instructions, policies, exceptions, etc. Also a life long learner. I don’t get tired of it and I enjoy learning more every year about how our world works and what makes it tick. \n\nMy only concern is that as I’ve gotten older my time has become so much more of a priority to me than it was in my twenties.   I value purpose and meaningful action far higher than money.  I chose to leave a career that promised that purpose which I mentioned and delivered nothing.  I will not do that again. \n\nSo I read all this doom and gloom about people shouldn’t go into law.  A part of me fears maybe it’s as bad as I hear and I don’t want anything to do with it. The other part of me thinks it’s people who have had the misfortune of growing up in a snowflake society and have a lack of  real work ethic or have yet to discover being five dollars from poverty for an extended amount of time.  I also understand mid twenties priorities may be mixed. I’d rather chase tail than go to school at that age and did just that. I’d like to hear from those from other careers who did law out of want and not just necessity if it’s a time suck or there is actual good to be done in the field.",

        "text": "have an interview next week with a crim appeals firm. i had applied through my school’s job board and since i saw they had no website then, i had just used the information they had included about their firm on the job posting to help me tailor my cover letter to the position.\n\nanyways, i’m a little anxious about adequately preparing for this interview since they don’t have a website for me to learn more about the firm. my current plan of action is to review my interviewers’ linkedin profiles, but i’m unsure where to go from there. at this point i just want to have something intelligible to say if they ask me “why do you want to work here?”. any tips on preparing?",

        "text": "So something weird happened in one of my classes this week and I guess I’m curious if most law students share these views or have experienced something similar to me. \n\nIn one of my classes that is a 3L legal philosophy/history kind of class, the discussion broke down to the history of the jury system and whether it works. My thoughts are that we probably need improvements, but that ultimately juries are a key feature of democracy and fair trials. A lot of people in class had a pretty cynical outlook saying things like “12 random people shouldn’t be able to decide the outcome of a case,” and “juries just end up agreeing with the judge,” and a few other similar thoughts. My point was that those maybe point to flaws in how juries are formed, but that surely does not mean we would be better off without juries. \n\nI find it pretty gross that people can make it through three years of law school and be so cynical that they think  judicial discretion is preferable to a jury. Of course JNOV, Summary Judgment, etc. exist that can take a decision away from a jury, but it’s important that those decisions are differentiated and appealable. \n\nAnyway, I was pretty surprised by what I thought was a cynical and not well reasoned sentiment. Maybe just a weird day where people weren’t participating or thinking, but idk.",

Long story short, I was able to get away w/ this in undergrad b/c most of my undergrad classes are just papers and exams that have a relatively lenient curve and it's totally fine to miss a week of class or two. Some of my undergrad professors have noticed that I looked \"in pain\" in class. I took the LSAT several times as well and was able to get a pretty good score on a day when I feel well. I worked at a firm before and had to take frequent medical leaves for this reason as well. With all the stress, tight deadline, and the expectation of professionalism, I am thinking that I won't be able to manage this...",
