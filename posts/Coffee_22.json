        "text": "**When it comes to specialty coffee, the clue is in the name. Specialty coffee (also known as speciality coffee) is a lot different from your usual coffee beans. A similar comparison would be regular beer vs craft beer. You can pick up a can of Heineken for ¬£1.50 or you could opt for a ¬£4 Beavertown brewery lager, with beautiful design, amazing flavour and award-winning quality.**\n\n**What is specialty coffee? According to the Specialty Coffee Association; ‚ÄúSpecialty coffee can consistently exist through the dedication of the people who have made it their life's work to continually make quality their highest priority. This is not the work of only one person in the lifecycle of a coffee bean; specialty can only occur when all of those involved in the coffee value chain work in harmony and maintain a keen focus on standards and excellence from start to finish. This is no easy accomplishment, and yet because of these dedicated professionals, there are numerous specialty coffees available right now, across the globe, and likely right around the corner from you.‚Äù**\n\n**For a coffee to be deemed specialty it must reflect quality from every step of the coffee creation process - from production, the green buyer, the roaster, the barista and of course you, the consumer. Specialty coffee must also score above 80 according to the SCA scoring system and is generally considered very good quality when scoring between 80-85, and excellent quality between 85-90 points. Geisha coffee (that we talk about** [**here**](https://www.risecoffeebox.co.uk/blog/geishacoffeebeans)**) would fall into this latter category. Coffee you find inside your** [**RiSE coffee box**](https://www.risecoffeebox.co.uk/coffee-subscription) **or on our** [**online shop**](https://www.risecoffeebox.co.uk/rise-coffee-marketplace) **generally range between 84-87.**¬†\n\n**Commodity grade coffee, generally found in the supermarket, would always score well below 80 and instant coffee wouldn‚Äôt even make the scale.**\n\n**The main difference between specialty coffee and coffee you find in the supermarket is related to price and volume. Supermarket coffees tend to be mass produced coffee which sits on the shelves as a commodity. This coffee is bought in huge bulk and therefore has to have a long shelf life. Specialty coffee is carefully picked by the roasters, a lot of thought goes into the beans they select, the defects, quality and tasting notes they experience. Speciality coffee is also roasted to order, and is therefore as fresh as it gets.**\n\n**Specialty coffee roasters review all aspects of the coffee from the origin of the bean (and whether it is in season), the altitude, varietals and generally spend a lot of direct time with the farmers and importers to ensure it is from a farm with good sustainable credentials and paying fair wages. The focus is purely on quality and using their skills to get the best from the beans, not on price or volume. The green bean is generally more expensive per kilogram (and fairer prices are paid).**\n\n**Supermarket coffee on the other hand is big business. Read a recent report on**[ **Wicked Leeks**](https://wickedleeks.com/) **- written by The Green Party's spokesperson on food, agriculture and rural welfare, Emily O'Brien.**\n\n***\"Supermarkets have an incredible stranglehold over their suppliers. Unlike in other businesses, food producers don‚Äôt just set their prices ‚Äì they plead for them. Supermarkets regularly refuse to pay an increase to their suppliers without demanding to see private accounts, poring over them line by line, making them justify every penny‚Äù***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.risecoffeebox.co.uk/blog/specialty-coffee-beans-vs-supermarket-coffee](https://www.risecoffeebox.co.uk/blog/specialty-coffee-beans-vs-supermarket-coffee)",

This coffee I would describe as having a **medium roast**, a **strong body** and **low acidity**. Moreover, it has some flavours of **chocolate**, **vanilla**, **honey**, **butter** and **cereals**, giving it a very sweet and overall great flavour (this is at least what they write on the label, although the first flavours I can really taste in the coffee).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is that I moved to Sweden some time ago and here I can obviously not buy this kind of coffee nor I have really found a brand that I like enough to be honest (and Swedish *traditional* coffee is not really my thing). I even asked some family members that have come visit to bring some packages of this good old coffe of mine that I like!, but this is obviously not a good plan in the long run. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was wondering if any of you could come up with some brand or kind of coffee that would have this kind of flavours and this level of roast, body and acidity in general, at least something on this style so I can give it a try! It's either good grinded coffee or beans!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks beforehand!",

Please help.\n\nMy coffee gear is a 12cup drip maker (for the rare occasion when we want 'bulk caffeine' instead of 'good coffee'), a #2 melitta cone and a #4 melitta cone (pour over for myself vs myself and partner)\n\nUsually I pour-over #2 size directly into a mug. #4 size usually goes into the 12cup drip carafe (to be split into our 16oz tumblers in the morning as we leave the house).\n\nWe've recently been wanting a 'small cup of coffee' each, which feels like the #4/drip carafe setup is overkill for. The #2 size doesn't sit on that carafe well, nor other pourable options (my liquid measuring cups, any tumbler, etc).... so i've been considering getting a hario glass carafe, but then I wonder if I should just go straight to chemex/bodum? I mean, I have a huge stash of melitta filters...but I could still use the melitta cones over the chemex for awhile until the filters get used up, right?  There's definitely a price difference...i'm just starting to feel lost in the options - especially once I saw the fellow double wall carafe and started rethinking heat retention.   \n\n\nWho's got what, and what do you like about it?",

I'm a huge fan of fruity, natural coffees that taste juicy and have been chasing that for some time. I recently upgraded by Fellow Ode to be stepless and added+aligned SSP MP burrs but was still unsatisfied with the cups I was getting - so I started playing with grind size and temperature all while following James Hoffman's technique. I found that there was a small window for grind size. Too fine and the cup tasted astringent and bitter. Too coarse and the cup tasted like nothing. Then I started playing with temperature and started to gradually decrease my temperatures, and that's when I started to have incredible cups. I found that 195 F worked best for my taste preferences, but the coffee was still a bit empty, so I upped the dose to 12g per 200g of water and that was it!\n\nThis is all to say - if you have similar taste preferences for lightly roasted, natural coffees and brew using immersion brewers - try lower temperatures. It's a fun experiment and you may get more delicious coffee out of it!",

They mainly did cold brew, with the occasional french press, but got a Black and Decker drip now that her teens have started drinking coffee as well. \n\nI want to get her a chemex, but idk if it will be long-term useful, given the amount of time she will have getting her kids to school. And if she already has a drip coffee maker a second (but nicer), one may just crowd her space. She REALLY likes dark roasts. She stated that her favorite coffee of all time was the oatmeal creme flavor from Bones. So if there's a brand that does that type of flavor or flavor profile, I'd appreciate learning about it.",

Recently, I switched over to filters from Aldi (they were given to me for free by a family member who had a bunch) and they have been terrible - uneven brew beds, dry patches of grounds, and watery underextracted coffee. So as much as I am grateful for the free filters, I‚Äôm going to ditch them in favor of something else.\n\nSo then: are there any 8-12 cup flatbottom filters you recommend? All else fails I just go for the standard Melittas but if there‚Äôs anything worth seeking out I‚Äôm interested.",

I brewed it and while the flavor notes were nice it was just a bit watery, more than my normal cup at least. I tried stirring it at the end to extract more flavor and the result was too bitter, I tried to up it to 3 tablespoons for a 12oz cup and that tasted somewhat nicer, fuller, but more bitter as well. Not sure what to do, not sure if the kinda lighter flavor is just inherent in the roast. Do y'all use different ratios for different roast levels of coffee? Unfortunately I'm stuck with no scale, only tablespoons and teaspoons, but I wanna make the most out of my coffee.",

However, my parents want to ditch their Nespresso machine and are looking to get a \"budget-friendly\" (around 700‚Ç¨ max) espresso setup and naturally I'm not going to complain. However, since coffee is not really a hobby for them, this means that I won't be able to buy the absolute best I can with the budget we have because of some constraints and so I have to compromise.\n\nSo, what is the best fully electric and with no modding required espresso setup under around 700‚Ç¨?\n\nFrom what I've gathered some good options are:\n\n* For the machine: Sage/Breville Bambino Plus, Lelit Anna, Gaggia Classic Pro\n* For the grinder: Sage/Breville Smart Grinder Pro, a Eureka Mignon (maybe?)\n* All in one: Sage/Breville Barista Pro or Impress\n\nAny tips or other suggestions?",

When you take off the front plate you can manually wobble the bearing prior to this mod.\n\nThe process is very simple. If you have \\[zeroed the grinder\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irzMw4UcTfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irzMw4UcTfY)) before you can do this. When you expose the adjustment dial just unscrew it all of the way. I wrapped 4 layers of the plumbers tape around the threads. Then just reassemble. You can feel the tighter tolerance and the bearing no longer wobbles. Made aligning the burrs slightly less painful.",

So I grabbed one of the pods from the last box and compared it to a pod from the new box. The pods are different. The new pods are weaker plastic, plastic cover instead of foil type. I brewed a cup with the old pod and then cut open both pods. The new pod was basically half empty of grounds, but the old pod was still pretty much full.

        "text": "Hey, so I just did a coffee cupping at home with the same coffee but 4 different grinders: Niche Zero, Timemore Slim hand grinder, integrated grinder of the BBE, and a cheaper ceramic hand grinder from Cilio.\n\nBeforehand I matched the grind sizes by looking at the ground coffee and rubbing between my fingers, which actually worked better than expected.\n\nI did a blind tasting, and it turns out I rated the Niche the worst, despite it being the most expensive. Niche and Timemore had a lot more going on flavor wise, which I didn't seem to enjoy, while BBE and Cilio were more flat.\nSo I guessed them exactly the other way round.\nI would have expected that a more expensive grinder grinds more uniform and should therefore have less bad tastes and be more balanced.\n\nWhat could be the explanation?\n\nHere's what I think:\n\nA: Matching the grind sizes isn't a good way to compare grinders, they might each need different settings to taste good, or I didn't do a good job at it.\n\nB: I am just bad at tasting or interpreting what I taste. It was my 4th cupping in total, and in the last one where I did 4 different coffees, I guessed 2 correct, but failed to recognise the coffee I have been drinking for the past weeks and mixed it up with a coffee I never had before.\nWith the different grinders, I could describe what I taste and identify similarities and differences, but then it was exactly the other way round to what I guessed, which again sounds to me like I interpreted it wrong.\n\nC: After the cupping, I opened and cleaned the Niche, and there was a lot of ground coffee stuck in it. So perhaps this contributed to the taste more than it should. The BBE grinder wasn't used in a long time and perfectly clean before the cupping, while the Niche is in use every day with different grind sizes and coffees.",
