        "text": "I have a friend and we've been arguing over race and IQ differences. My friend argues that the races have different average IQs and that the difference is due partially to genetics.\n\nI think this is racist pseudoscience but I asked for some reading material and he provided me some. Now I don't know how to respond to what I have read.\n\nFirst he asked me to read Chapter 13 and 14 in the Bell Curve which is about race and IQ. I read them and argued that the IQ difference was due to the tests being biased.\n\nHe then pointed me to this source http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/PP279_Neisser1.pdf which is an American Psychological Association summary of experts in psychometrics (idk if that's the correct term of the field). The panel came to the conclusion that IQ tests are not biased.\n\nThen I argued that it's because of unequal schooling and education. I said that blacks typically go to poorer schools whereas whites go to wealthier better funded schools with better teachers.\n\nHe then showed me this source http://www.jbhe.com/latest/news/1-22-09/satracialgapfigure.gif which is a graph that points out that rich black kids have lower SAT scores than poor white kids.\n\nI then argued (and still believe) that he is just cherry picking and that experts in the field of intelligence research don't agree with him. I don't think intelligence can be measured accurately and furthermore I don't think IQ differences have anything to do with genetics. He then lended me a book called The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy. The book gathers statistics on the opinions of experts in intelligence research and compares it to how the media reports the issue.\n\nI can't show you guys the book but the Wikipedia article cites these pieces of information from the book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IQ_Controversy,_the_Media_and_Public_Policy_(book)\n\n&gt;Snyderman and Rothman discovered that experts were in agreement about the nature of intelligence.[6] \"On the whole, scholars with any expertise in the area of intelligence and intelligence testing (defined very broadly) share a common view of the most important components of intelligence, and are convinced that it can be measured with some degree of accuracy.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;The role of genetics in the black-white IQ gap has been particularly controversial. The question regarding this in the survey asked \"Which of the following best characterizes your opinion of the heritability of black-white differences in IQ?\" Amongst the 661 returned questionnaires, 14% declined to answer the question, 24% voted that there was insufficient evidence to give an answer, 1% voted that the gap was \"due entirely to genetic variation\", 15% voted that it was \"due entirely to environmental variation\" and 45% voted that it was a \"product of genetic and environmental variation\". According to Snyderman and Rothman, this contrasts greatly with the coverage of these views as represented in the media, where the reader is led to draw the conclusion that \"only a few maverick 'experts' support the view that genetic variation plays a significant role in individual or group difference, while the vast majority of experts believe that such differences are purely the result of environmental factors.\"\n\nThe last time I argued with him I said that he should read The Mismeasure of Man, but he pointed out that Stephen J Gould's views are not only not supported by the majority of people in intelligence research, a claim that I did in fact read in one of the books he provided to me. But he also showed me this \n\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071\n\nWhich shows that Stephen J Gould was wrong about Morton in his book and that he isn't a reliable source on the topic.\n\nHe also showed me a passage in Richard Dawkins book The Ancestors Tale where Richard Dawkins talks about how Stephen J Gould would let his personal beliefs interfere with his science work.\n\n\nI don't know how to respond to all this stuff anymore, I need help to show that the stuff my friend has been showing me is bullshit. He thinks he has won the argument and it's pissing me off. Can you guys please help me by pointing out sources of material I can read to debunk this crap?",

It's at the point where it's hard to see any conversation about relationship issues without someone bringing up the five love languages.\n\nHowever, I admit some skepticism regarding the book. I read it, and it didn't seem to have a very good scientific basis. It was based entirely on anecdotal accounts from Dr. Chapman himself, and he makes major generalizations from those observations. I'm also not sure about the author's credentials. He does have an M.A. in anthropology, but his Ph.D. and primary field of work has been in religious education and theology. As far as I can tell, he doesn't have any professional qualifications for therapy or relationship counseling. When I read the book, it was obvious at times that his statements came from a Christian perspective rather than a scientific one.\n\nNone of this means that there is anything wrong with the love languages, but when an entire social construct comes from a single person who claims that he's the sole purveyor of it, there's good reason to pause and think about it. Because of this, I'm curious if there has been any independent research regarding the five love languages. Namely, are there really only five languages, and do they match up to Chapman's claims? Do relationship counselors use the five love languages in their work, and do they find it effective? Is there any research on whether or not applying the five love languages actually helps relationships?",

Anyone can pretend to be an expert on a subject and make up a narrative that is wildly out of touch with reality, and people looking to learn have no way of discerning the good from the bad.  Some may go even further and actively look for bad information to avoid cognitive dissonance and no longer deal with the phenomenon in a healthy way.\n\nHave there been studies conducted on how information volume has affected the congruity of an individual's perception of reality with the actual reality that lies outside of that perception?

I thought then, that perception of masculinity is tied to perception of war, and that masculinity and feminity are tied to one another in this regard.\nI ask to affirm or dispel such notion, and at least better my own understanding. Cheers.\n\nI know this is broad question. Feel free to narrow it down to certain perspectives, time-periods and such. Litterature on the subject would be nice too. ",

        "text": "In media \"racist\" is mainly used as a highly-negative label. It functions as a social discouragement against openly expressing your racial prejudices. \n\nHowever, it's a very broad concept as the most labels are. You can call racist a person who literally wants to obliterate another race or a person who is skeptical of the affirmative action. Such broadness has some potential risks. For the most extreme side of the spectrum, label could lose some of it's punishment power. On the other hand, the least extreme side could be \"punished\" disproportionately, especially if misunderstanding is involved.\n\nAlso it's hard to find any objective definitions of racism. Wiktionary defines it as \"A person who believes a particular race is superior to others\":  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/racist. Doesn't help much, as \"superior\" can have thousands of meanings. Including ones, that definitely wouldn't make you racist: for instance if you define \"superior\" like having the largest average height, definition loses it's negative value. \n\nSo some questions to consider: \n\n* What are possible objective definitions of the concept and is there a consensus on them? \n* What are pros-cons of the concept modern usage? Do we have enough evidence to make a good estimation? \n* What are good ways to mitigate disadvantages of it's usage? \n* Some possible mitigation methods to consider: promoting responsible usage in media, legalizing the term (so court gives labels, not media), creating more diverse set of labels. How hard to implement these methods? How effective they could be? \n* Do we have historical examples of successful dealing with catch-all negative labels at society level? \n\nAs this is a broad topic, it's rather invitation to discussion, than request for a perfect answer. The main focus is the second part of the questions (practical part), the first part is to get the discussion on the common ground (theoretical part). ",
