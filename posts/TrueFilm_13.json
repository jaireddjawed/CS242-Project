What is it about his process, the way he makes these types of film so successful. Blockbuster filmmaking being such high concept. I remember watching a video that talked about how blockbuster filmmaking is an art in its self and takes a specific set of skills and techniques to achieve and that Cameron was front in center in that video.\n\nFor those that have a better understanding of filmmaking than me, what is it about Cameron that makes his films so great in this regard?",

I don't necessarily have a film studies background but I do pride myself on willing to be open to things I'm not normally used to, and thought I should challenge myself and broaden my horizons of what the best of (world) cinema has to offer.\n\nHowever, after watching from the likes of Tarkovsky, Lynch, Fellini, Sanjit, Kitano, Murnau, Kiarostami, Rohmer, Godard, I can only appreciate them for their cultural/historical significance, but I can't say all, if not most of them, shook me, and some were just difficult to finish. There is just no emotional impression, and far and away from how other people speak so highly of these films. What am I missing or not seeing?\n\nEven looking at the recent [S&amp;S poll list](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/revealed-results-2022-sight-sound-greatest-films-all-time-poll), I can recognize these films, but I'm not sure how many I had a pleasant experience or memory of watching them.\n\nAm I just burned out? Putting these films on too high a pedestal? Or a film phony?\n\nCan someone can educate themselves to learn how to appreciate these films? Or should I just stick with my gut feeling?",

Its nadir was during Nazi Germany, where many Jews were murdered as they were Hitler's scapegoats. \n\nThe Nazi weren't the only ones, however.  Many Catholics forget that the Catholic Church, during the 16th century, was among the greatest persecutors of Jews. A group of institutions within the Catholic Church was created to address and punish heresy, and this was known as The Inquisition. \n\nRipstein features The Mexican Inquisition, and how one family, the Carvajal family, were outed by their very own. One of the sons, Gaspar, became a priest of the Catholic Church and saw that his mother and siblings practiced a different set of burial rites. How the Church forces one to turn against even family was written well. \n\nEventually, they are all persecuted: the matriarch is tortured, the daughter is raped, and Luis Carbajal, the man who strives to uphold his faith, eventually betrays everyone he knows. \n\nTo say that the Catholic Church has been an consistent exemplar of kindness is also the peak of hypocrisy: 350 years before Hitler, the Catholic Church were among the largest antisemitics, as killing the Jews would also allow the Church to seize their property.\n\nIt was a dark time in the Catholic Church. This is why it is important never to forget history, because it informs us what to do in the present. \n\nAn excellent historical drama that makes one reflect upon the heinous evil that Catholic Church once committed, The Holy Inquisition is a reminder to place our faith in what Jesus practiced, not in the institutions that man merely created. It is also an appeal against intolerance, especially in this day and age. \n\nDefinitely a deserving Palme d'Or nominee.  \n\n8.5/10",

        "text": "Just finished Doctor Sleep, and it got me thinking about The Shining, which I had first watched a couple of weeks ago. I went into The Shining knowing the \"Here's Johnny!\" scene and a couple of out-of-context lines. I came out of it thinking that Kubrick did some things very well and some things quite poorly.\n\nIn terms of what he did well, I think the atmosphere is one of the scariest I've ever seen in a movie. Without relying on many jump scares, Kubrick created a genuinely suspenseful, terrifying, and enthralling setting (which can't be said for most horror movies). The \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene was probably the scariest I've seen in any movie, and it was without any monsters or jump scares or effects. Truly impressive. Also, the cast was quite good. Jack Nicholson's performance is iconic for a good reason. I was conflicted on Shelley Duvall, sometimes thinking that her performance was great and other times that she was over the top. That being said, I know the abuse she suffered at Kubrick's hands on set.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like character development was lacking. We get some development for Jack, but not much. For most of the movie, Wendy felt like she was a meek housewife (though I was impressed when she locked Jack in the meat locker). Danny also felt like he didn't have much character to him other than fear and shining. From what I've seen online, this is a far cry from the book, where Jack is depicted as a loving father who tries as hard as he can to fight back against the hotel, where Wendy has a tougher temperament, and Danny actively agrees to stay at the hotel because he knows it is important to his father.\n\nOverall, I thought this was one of the best horror movies I've seen, and I understood why it is  a staple of the horror genre. Sadly, though, it was a movie that lacked a lot of necessary substance that could have made it go from a great horror movie to a great movie generally.",

If it established by the creator early on then it feels pointless to me. I have a tendency to view those kinds of movies with contempt for that very reason. I get annoyed when something made to be beautiful is trying to force it's own views upon me. That is why i usually enjoy movies without a message way more. A good movie is there to do one thing and one thing only, Tell a good compelling story that holds a high enough quality that it ties the viewer in with just it's beauty and storytelling. Not the movie going \"this thing is bad and immoral\" or \"one should never do this or that\". Do you agree/disagree? What are your thoughts?",

        "text": " What do you think about \"Viridiana\"?\n\nmy confused thoughts (spoilers onwards obviously):\n\nThis is the second Buñuel film I saw after \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie\", which I liked. \"Viridiana\" also took some interesting turns, but all in all it was less remarkable storywise and visually, and I'm surprised to have seen some people calling it his best. Especially the ending didn't make a lot of sense (not in a \"this is so quirky and surreal\" way, which would've been good, but in a \"what point is this making?\" way): throughout the film Viridiana is (almost) raped multiple times, gets traumatized due to this, and rejects others like Jorge trying to exploit her, but then the ending throws this all overboard and seems to imply religion was really the only thing stopping her from secretly desiring him all along. In an earlier scene the film seemingly satirized Jorge calling her a \"prude\" while this was just because his ego was hurt, but in this ending scene suddenly the movie takes a 180° turn and says \"no, he was actually right\"?\n\nSomething similar goes for the group of beggars. The film at first seems headed to show how they can be redeemed by changing the conditions they live and work in / treating them with respect. But then it paints them in an over-the-top stereotypical light and even appears to convey some reactionary sentiment about how they are just destined to be this way because they are uneducated and poor? Am I reading some things wrong here? what was the message behind all this, apart from all the obvious anti-religious messages? Of course a film doesn't have to convey a message, but this one surely did seem to be trying hard to do so.",

        "text": "*“My whole point is that nothing is being revealed, and that's the genius of this film, if there is a genius.”*\n\nThere is Camera A, which shoots various actors’ essential live audition tape of some campy (ironic description given that the a big part of the project is to break through the artificiality of acting) marriage dispute scene. There is Camera B, a sort of in-between camera, filming a documentary of the filming of these live auditions, in practice serving a similar purpose to both the camera it’s filming and the camera that it’s being filmed by. That would be Camera C, filming a documentary about the filming of the documentary about the filming of the live auditions, which offers the crucial distance needed to see the whole project for what it is, a big nothingness. Then the crew, befuddled by the pointlessness of this project, start filming their chats behind-the-scenes, adding another stratum of potential meaning and intention, wherein they attempt to project meaning unto a purposeless film and unto the either aimless or comic-genius director, same as we do. But there also comes a moment when one of them starts talking about these various levels of reality which the film layers endlessly, and how the audience can’t even know whether the crew isn’t also faking it and are actually under total command of the director, upon which any notion of what the film is about—a layered documentary about finding new acting styles; about acting in general; a layered, metafictional documentary of the levels of reality not only wrt to film but to reality itself; a documentary about the figuring out of what the documentary is about; a big improvisation à la cinematic free jazz; a film about the artistic endeavor in general; sexuality; a document on the evolution of the artistic process into a more democratic function, in line with contemporaneous Hippie Ideals; entropy; etc.—essentially dissolves and all that we’re left with is perhaps the single most hilarious cinematic Shaggy Dog story ever told. Which is not to say that all the things mentioned become irrelevant, since the very nature of the film is such that it’s shaped but whatever input the crew, cast, and extraneous elements happen to throw its way*; it’s just that they’re not leading to an all-satisfying, grand climax. But trust me when I say that we get something better.\n\nNot only is this just so hilarious, but that \"french\" dude at the end? Talk about serendipity; what a magnificently digressive way to end it, upping the comedy while making way for unexpectedly stirring political and personal sentiment. Either William Greaves is a genius and this is one big hoax and joke that only he knew about, the ultimate troll film of not so much the audience (though that too, especially if those crew talks are fake) but mostly his own crew, a giant dupe that nonetheless envelopes endless humanity within its borders, or he was in way over his head and simply stumbled into one of the greatest cinematic pranks ever made, an exercise in, well, empty exercise, in which case he was still smart enough to see what he had. Either way, this is one of the funniest, most fun things to ever be taped.\n\n*Which is sort of the meaning of the title; according to Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; The title came from Greaves's own fascination with scientific concepts. The concept of symbiotaxiplasm originated from Arthur F. Bentley in his book Inquiry Into Inquiries: Essays in Social Theory, which Greaves described as **\"those events that transpire in the course of anyone's life that have an impact on the consciousness and the psyche of the average human being, and how that human being also controls or effects changes or has an impact on the environment.\"**\n\nFor all those who have not seen the film and may be confused by this post, know that there is no way to describe the film since it involves myriad layers and aspects of subterfuge and deceptions whose own point might have grown far beyond what the director envisioned and into reals of post-modern pointlessness that the only thing to do is simply this: watch the damn thing and enjoy it. It’s on the Criterion Channel for those who have that. \n\nAnd if my rant should prove a bit rambly, confusing or rudderless, I'll just chalk it up to being on-brand to the film. But seriously though, watch the film.",

        "text": "Okay, so I have to hold up my hands up and say that when I originally watched Avatar when it came out in the cinemas, while gobsmacked by the special effects, I was bored towards the end due to how long it was, it felt like a slog.\n\nPlus, the storyline felt very predictable to me, having already seen Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves. I never bothered to watch it since.\n\nAnyway, as a huge fan, I booked Avatar: Way of the Water for when it comes out and I realised I'd have to rewatch the original at some point or I'd be totally lost. I could remember the main thrust of the world but I didn't want to miss any of the nuances or references - not after paying good noney to see the sequel. I was kind dreading having to watch it again, to be honest. I'd been putting it off for a while.\n\nSo I watched it today and was surprised to find I was totally absorbed from the start. The story begins at a really fast pace. If I recall correctly, the main the character is captured by the Navi as his Avatar only about 20/30 minutes in - to put it into context. Cameron sets up the world, the main characters and the central conflict really fluidly. \n\nPlus the characters are fun to watch. Sam Worthington is a better actor than I remembered. Zoe Saldana was particularly great, so expressive. Forgot the amazing Giovanni Ribisi was in it. Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver were solid. Yes, some of the characters were cheesy and came out with some cheesy lines - but I feel like there was a real sense of fun and these characters suited the fantasy sci-fi backdrop.\n\nThe film, while long (2hr40), also moves along at a good pace. It never really feels stale. Perhaps with age, I've grown more patient and more appreciative of the wonder. I have a fsr more inquisitivemind these days. I'm fearful not quite as fearful of the 3hr20min runtime. \n\nAnyway, it was a pleasant surprise that it was so enjoyable. Even the storyline, the classic 'colonist joins tribe and fights against own people to become saviour' I felt was done really well here - like much better than in past instances. So I didn't mind it wasn't original - it felt like the perfect way to introduce the world.\n\nI've not really seen much discussion from people who didn't like it that much at first deciding to rewatch it. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

        "text": "(reposting this here from r/movies, was told it may be a more relevant sub, hope that’s okay and feel free to remove if not appropriate, first time posting here)\n\n*Mild spoilers for the film below*\n\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who gave this 3.5hr ‘exploration of a Belgian housewife’s chores’ a go in response to the BFI poll, where it’s rocketed straight up to number one, and it’s left me wondering *why now*? Citizen Kane, Vertigo, both hugely influential and uncontentious challengers for the top spot, but Jeanne Dielman is an achingly slow, experimental film that would put off your average viewer, whereas I think most of the other films on the list have at least some mainstream appeal alongside their artistic merit.\n\nFirst, my impressions. I genuinely did enjoy the film and I definitely wouldn’t say it’s boring, at times it can become almost hypnotic like the rhythmic beat of train tracks going by. It’s not entertaining exactly, but as long as you’re in the mood for something a little more leisurely and contemplative then it’s an easy enough watch. A rewarding one too.\n\nQuick overview… we see our housewife going about her daily life in painstaking detail. A routine clearly refined over time down to mechanical precision. All her actions seem automated and perfunctory, with very little joy or expression, she’s living largely to the beat of economic necessity. In focussing so closely on such minutia though we start to notice off-beats creep in. Her growing malaise, or perhaps frustration, is not depicted with emotional outbursts or verbal tirades, but instead with subtle shifts in her actions and mannerisms that convey her inner state. This is where the ‘monotony’ of the first day’s routine pays off, as by familiarising ourselves with her fastidiousness, a later hair out of place or pot lid askew becomes as overt as a gun shot in any other film. Even that prolonged potato peeling scene becomes engaging; the sheer level of intimacy and familiarity we’ve developed forces empathy and you *feel* the apathy and weary resignation with which she goes about her task. There’s a strong sense that the film is building to something but you’re not quite sure what, which produces a ‘soft tension’ that keeps you engrossed.\n\nIn terms of themes, it obviously has a lot to say about the role of woman in society and I don’t want to diminish or dismiss that message at all. However, I’m sure that particular theme has been talked about at length many times over, and that message was as true and pertinent in 2012 and 2002 (etc) as it is today, so personally I don’t think it’s why it’s taken the top spot. Instead, I’m wondering if covid, and particularly lockdowns and other disruptions have pushed Jeanne Dielman to newfound relevance (finally getting to the point of this ramble XD).\n\nArguably the most profound impact of covid is that our own routines have been disrupted, and I think that’s forced a lot of people to take stock of their lives. When living day to day, as Jeanne Dielman does, it’s so easy to sink into comforting habits that carry you along. It’s all too rare that we stop to consider our own satisfaction, sense of purpose or ambitions, they’re sacrificed for a sense of reassuring predictability. Even as the mundanity wears us down though, we often don’t notice until it becomes so prominent it warrants a label; stress, burnout, depression. I think covid brought to light a growing dissatisfaction with that way of life, a realisation that something, *anything*, has to change as humans aren’t automatons. We can’t dutifully perform the same tasks day in, day out without pause. Like Jeanne, eventually something has to give or else we break.\n\nI think that’s what I took from the film. A reminder to take some time to evaluate our own routines and life direction, and to consider whether it’s taking us somewhere we want to go. Not that we’re always given that level of agency of course, economic necessity plays a large role here too, but then that speaks to wider issues in society. Of course this probably isn’t the film’s original vision, but I hate to admit that I did resonate with the forced monotony of it all. I’ve certainly had long periods when I’ve coasted along without much thought until something derailed me, and then I’ve been amazed it didn’t happen sooner. I guess every now and then, it’s worth taking a stab at something new!",

        "text": "I just finished watching Robert Eggers' *The Lighthouse* and I was blown away. One thing that stood out to me was the characters referring to one another as \"dog\" or in other canine ways. Throughout the first two acts, there are multiple instances where Thomas Wake refers to Thomas Howard/Ephraim Winslow as a dog. The first mention is when Wake asserts his power to Howard, telling Howard that he'll do whatever he tells him to and he'll \"like it cuz I says you will! Contradict me again, and I'll dock your wages. Swab, dog, swab.\" Later, Howard reveals to Wake that when he was working as a logger \"that goddamned Canady bastard \\[the real Ephraim Winslow\\] always called me a dog. A filthy dog. I'll show you a dog. I'll show you whose a dog.\" This anecdote makes it clear to the audience, and evidently to Wake, that this term gets under Howard's skin. The term represents the power other people exert onto Howard, a man who yearns for the day he can be free from obligation and dependence. Later, when Howard recounts the death of the real Ephraim Winslow, we remarks that the last thing he yelled to him was \"Tom, you dog!\" During one of the film's major turning points when Wake confronts Howard about killing the gull and Howard denies it, Wake shouts that he is a \"murdering dog! Twas what changed the wind on us. Twas ye what damned us, dog. Twas ye!\" Moments later, Wakes continues his verbal assault, telling Howard that \"Winslow were right! Thomas, ye're a dog! A filthy dog! A dog!\" It is upon the delivery of this line that Pattinson's character lunges at Dafoe's, sending them sprawling onto the wooden floor. After Howard leaves Wake in a huddled in pain on the floor, he stands directly over him and commands him to \"bark\" like a dog. \"Bark, boy, bark\" Howard insists. After a pause, Wake's meager \"woof\" marks what I believe to be the final stage of the shift in power dynamic between the two men. Whatsmore, after Wake's woofing, Howard asks him \"whose a good boy\" and to \"roll over\" in the same way a dog-owner would speak to their dog. What follows is an extreme, but powerful representation of just how drastically the power has shifted in Howard's favor. As he walks into the foreground, we see his is holding a rope lead on the end of which is Wake crawling on all fours like a dog. Here, Eggers makes no attempt at subtlety to convey the power Howard seems to wield in the two men's relationship. No longer is he the one being treated like a dog as if he is less than human. Now he is the one who holds the leash and dictates the other man, both literally and metaphorically. Notably, the raging tempest that dominates the film after Howard kills the gull seems to have completely dissipated. Pointing to the empty pit at the base of the lighthouse, he orders Wake to \"get in there; where you belong. You do as I say, dog.\" Howard proceeds to shovel dirt directly on top the old wickie. Now it was at this moment in the film that I expected Wake to break. I expected an increasingly tearful scene where Wake begs to be spared while Howard basks in the victory of literally burying the only obstacle that stands between him and the light. But as heaps of dirt are stacked onto his beaten body, Wake does not fuss nor cry. Instead, he is remarkably calm and seems to taunt Howard, asking the younger man if he wishes \"to see what's in the lantern?\" before delivering one of the film's most memorable monologues in which he laments about \"what Protean forms swim up from men's mind and melt into hot Promethean plunder, scorching eyes and divine shames and horror and casting them down into Davy Jones. The others, still blind, yet in it see all the divine graces ... Them's truth. You'll be punished.\"\n\nI am wondering what you all think about the significance of \"dog\" name calling and references throughout the film? Why does it bother Winslow to such an extreme extent? Is it used by Eggers to portray the rapid shift in the two men's power dynamic? What does it say about Thomas Howard's struggle to assert his identity? Based on Wake's calm demeanor and ominous monologue as Howard buries him, do you think there was a shift in power to begin with or does it just appear that way to Howard because he is the one who now holds the leash? Did Wake know that Howard was doomed from the beginning and will inevitably succumb to the fatal truth that awaits him atop the lighthouse? Does the light represent truth, which is why it kills Howard - a man averse to the truth?",

It was mad fun for me.  \n\nSomebody said it before (I guess). The worst thing that happened to Birdman was that it built an expectation amongst people of a certain kind of film - perhaps a mainstream one, even one that is about an actual superhero - that, when people went to see the actual movie, they couldn't reconcile themselves with it. The amount of flak it received when it came out combined with its hysterical sweep at the Oscars was as irreconcilable as people's reactions. \n\nI am absolutely stunned by its cinematography. No less could be said of the performances of the actors and actresses. Edward Norton is a true gem. He has done so many epic films (Fight Club, 25th Hour, American History X) that it's hard to figure which one was he the best in. It is also weird to realize that Keaton received his first Golden Globe in this and after this was awarded 4 SAGs in 5 nominations. \n\nLubezki is the master of his art, truly, here. A lot of people had applauded his technical excellence in Gravity. He would go on to do the only Oscar Hattrick in history in next year winning for The Revenant. However, how Cinematography contributed to the rhythm and pacing of this film combined with the fact that the \"one-shot\" feature was basically intrinsic to this film's existence. The scene where Riggan has to run across the Times Square and makes the epic entry into the audience is absolutely hysterical. \n\nThis is not a movie that is liked across all audiences. The commercial movie-goers often say, \"What the hell is happening? Why the hell is this happening?\" The Arties go, \"What's it trying to say? Is it saying anything?\" \n\nIt's been a while since it's released. It would be great to see how people view it today.",

It doesn't leave any thinking to do for us. While making a black comedy film such as Triangle of Sadness and Parasite is really a brilliant way of sending messages and making a stand. Especially when every other aspect in the film is well done. It's entertaining and makes you laugh as well as blowing up your mind. It's really genius to combine these two sides in a single film.\n\nI think this film and Parasite are very alike. They talk about similar subjects and deliver them in a similar way yet they're so different and for me that's the brilliance in cinema, like two people would be making a film about the very same subject but in a total different ways. \n\nI'm also so glad that Woody Harelson got to be a part of such a great film.

The visual and sound design just make you completely immersed. It feels it gives you answers to things you didnt know you needed. I dont know how to describe it better.

I know this is probably stupid and a pointless question to ask but why was that scene put in there? Was it symbolism for Cassell’s character, while watching the film I was wondering why it was done that way.",

        "text": "“Not everything is fleeting. Some feelings run deep.”\n\nI had planned to watch this film since 2019, but circumstances never allowed me to, until it has already been three years. It’s a good thing that Sight and Sound has released their updated list of the Greatest Films of All Time. The latest entries were from 2019 (the other entry was Parasite), but this was ranked at #30. \n\nFrom the get-go, we are introduced to the Portrait of a Lady on Fire and shown the bare face of the painter. Hers is a beautiful face, with cool brown eyes, staring into the distance as if pining for a time, or a person. The film is exquisitely shot: we are shown picturesque waves striking upon sea-battered rocks as the shot closes in on the painter wringing her wet dress. We are later introduced to her as Marianne. \n\nThe use of candlelight reminds me of both **Chess of the Wind** and **Barry Lyndon**: as the flicker of light shines upon Marianne’s face, the viewer becomes captivated, again, by her beauty. She has been hired to paint the bride-to-be, Heloise, surreptitiously, so that she could be married, even though Heloise is against marriage in the first place. \n\nThe scene composition is simply exemplary: even the smoke rising in the background billows suggestively while Marianne drinks wine. \n\nThese are two women who refuse to marry, because one is academic, and another would rather take over her father’s business. In one aspect, the Filipino hesitancy to allow same-sex marriage reflects an unwillingness to let people choose for themselves. The film remains to be a microcosm of intolerance that remains pervasive the world over.\n\nI think this film is particularly resonant because many of us gloss over the responsibilities and difficulties a woman faces in life. Although pregnancy is an act that occurs between male and female, the responsibility of carrying a child largely falls on the lady. Abortion is also a choice that solely lies on the mother, as could be seen in the film, but it is not without risk, and is definitely painful.\n\nSciamma made a creative choice in limiting the film to female characters. The men are lurking in the background, but by this act, Sciamma also empowers the female: they are the ones who will ultimately deal with the choices they make. The allusive nature of the film, particularly pertaining to the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, but appropriated, was also excellently written. \n\nThe micro-expressions are also on-point: when Marianne does not know what to do next, she mouth-breathes – and in a future scene, this is what she does after a kiss. The pair enter into a relationship knowing that after the completion of the portrait, it will end. Despite that, however, even after the passage of time, one realizes that they never stopped loving each other, from the page of the portrait Marianne drew of herself, to Marianne’s portrait of the lady on fire. \n\nThe denouement of the film all the more affirms this persistent love, because neither of them have forgotten or will ever forget. \n\nIntelligent, sensual, and quietly heartrending, Portrait of a Lady on Fire deserves to be among the greatest films of all time. It is a celebration of the power of women, an appeal against intolerance, and a beautifully rendered love story, all at the same time.",

Here are a few I can think of:\n\nRebecca (1940): The build up, mystery and melodrama of this film is almost perfect as we see Joan Fontaine's character learning more about the legendary Rebecca after marrying Maxim De Winter. She finds out what really happened to Rebecca in a great twist and all of a sudden this Gothic mystery because a dull procedural for about 30 minutes before the great ending. \n\nNight of the Hunter (1955): The movie felt so ahead of its time with with surreal storybook feel and surprisingly dark horror. Rev Powell is a brilliant villain chasing after defenseless children and then out of nowhere the dark thriller becomes a feel good family movie with a very unsatisfying ending.\n\nThe Searchers (1956): The story of Ethan Edwards is also brilliantly dark especially for the 1950s as we see a man consumed with hatred planning to kill rather than rescue his kidnapped niece. This character is so fascinating and all the scenes around him are perfect but then we get goofy interludes of dance scenes and looney tunes fights which take away from the pacing and what should be a focus on the search itself.",

When they see the thieves Luke hides while Rob is just dumbstruck and stays there. When the thieves harass Rob for money Luke glances at Rob but decides to stay there. Luke wants to help but is too scared. This whole commotion shows Luke is a bit of a coward. Rob is hit twice with a rod cause he refused to give up his ring. Death of Rob felt weird cause the thieves took didn't have to hit him twice to rob him. When they hit him first he was already on the floor and they could have just took the ring. One of the thief was a bit crazy which might explain the rash decision.\n\nThe remaining four friends after the death of Rob decides to go trekking in Sweden to and pay homage to their dead friend by making some king of a memorial on top of a hill. Luke is visibly upset and feels responsible for Robs death. We can see Luke is visibly tensed as he smokes now and then which wasn't shown previously. Hutch reassures Luke that he's not responsible for Rob's death.\n\nAs the trek continues Dom hurts his leg. Dom's friends think he's just over acting and is just whining so they decide to take a shortcut to their lodge. They shortcut is through a forest. After getting in the forest they are first frightened by an elk which is gutted. They first think it's hunters then assume that it might be a bear. Since the corpse look fresh they decide to got out of that place. \n\nNight falls but they didn't reach their destination as hoped and decides to stay at an abandoned cabin. They find some kind of an effigy with real bones for a leg. Luke also hears some king of screaming and whaling outside but since they have no other choice they sleep.\n\nEveryone had nightmares. Luke woke up in the middle of woods with wounds on his chest. Luke had nightmares on how he's a coward. Hutch peed himself, Dom was calling out his wife and Phil is naked and praying to the weird structure in the house. The thing could have killed them there but from Phil's case we understand it commands respect and the effigy is of the thing itself. \n\nDom decides to take the a path he sees cause a path should lead to somewhere. I still didn't understand that logic. Why would you take a path if you don't know where it leads to. So cause of Dom everyone ignores the compass and pursues the path. They keep quite about what has happened but Phil brings it up. Some dismiss as bad nightmare that happened to all of them at once. \n\nDom calls Luke a coward for not standing up for Rob and gets punched in the face. When Luke asks Hutch if he feels the same way he replies with \" I don't know\" which leaves Luke devastated. Luke probably realized everyone thinks the same way. \n\nUnfortunately they didn't reach their destination this night too and camps. Hutch is killed and gutted. They find his body and are visibly nauseous and shaken. Dom insists on covering the body with twigs so they can reach back for the body. Phil loses all hope and says that the thing got into his mind. Phil has no morale now.\n\nLater Phil is also taken. Now both Luke and Dom run and finds a lit up path. They get inside yet another cabin. \n\nNow both of them are tied up inside a cabin. An elderly woman gives Luke some water and shows him that she have the same marks. They don't give water to Dom cause he's going to be a sacrifice. Dom is taken upstairs and is prepared for sacrifice. He's again tied downstairs later where he too loses all hope but wants Luke to burn everything down. \n\nDon is almost eaten by the monster while Luke breaks his own hand to escape.  He burns some kind of ritual place grabs a gun. Luke later takes a shot at the monster. Monster follows him and Luke still has visions of him back at the liquor store which is the way of the monster saying that he's still a coward. Monster asserts dominance by making Luke bow down. Luke refuses and hits it with an axe and runs. Luke at last gets out of the forest and screams back at the monster showing that he's no longer scared.\n\nOverall I think the movie coveys a message about being brave and not running away from anything. It is a pretty good watch.",

        "text": "I personally see signs of this in almost every scene. Each character represents some superpower or social group.       \n Everything starts off in the \"good old days\" with the high class living large on the boat, while their needs are met by the working class(poor countries). Slowly a storm comes in and everyone`s party gets spoiled, after \"crazy rich russians\" make everyone swim(go to war) and the ship duties get neglected, and russian caviar makes everyone puke. The american captain is drunk at the wheel(USA leading the world), while the russian shit seller(oil and gas seller) is just as drunk and are both trying to be eachother(russia trying to be a capitalist and ship captain, while US is trying to be socialist). Both screaming on \"the world stage\" while everyone is forced to listen to two rambling morons. American captain lamenting he has too much. Nordic states(Paula, the crew chief) are trying to be responsible but its still so they can make money(money!money!money! scene). The two old people are the UK obviously, and they being blown up by their own grenade might be related to Brexit. Carl and Yaya are, maybe, the old and new generation of the world. They get a free ride on this trip. At the restaurant, Yaya tries not to pay, cause she cant, even thought she makes \"more money than Carl\"(inflation?). When sunbathing on the deck and Carl gets jealous, this might be a metaphor for the younger generation being ok with immigrants(especially middle eastern ones), while the older generation are trying to get them off the boat(deported). After that scene Carl tries to get his girlfriend a ring to make that bond stronger, but cant afford it. The ring is modeled by Paula(nordic states), as in the old generation would like to give their children the nordic model of society, but cant afford, to try and make up for their racism/xenophobia. French lady is France, who gets that girl to swim, even though she doesnt want to. This might be a comment on France trying to get Ukraine to accept Russias terms in the war, because \"Dmitri is going to buy the ship anyway\" and will soon call the shots. Plus, everybody is forced to go swimming, as in, Russia drags the whole world into a war, all while the food will spoil in the kitchen where the russian music is playing(waste of resources or wheat not being harvested in Ukraine) Also, when the chef tells the kitchen crew \"all right, youre all going to waterslide\", his accent makes it sound \"all right, youre all going to war-slide\". Girl who is the first to swim is also blonde with blue eyes. Blue-yellow is the ukranian flag. When they come get the drunk captain who has no interest in running the ship(similar to Trump and international politics), russian music is also blasting in his room, alluding maybe to Trump and his russian ties. Dmitri(Russia) also puts a microphone in front of the captain(Trump) so he can talk shit about his own country \"on the world stage\", after giving him books to read. Dmitri also says \"youre not fired\" to Paula, meaning he is in control now.                    \n  Once on the island the russian is holding the corpse of his girlfriend(Mother Russia/USSR) crying about her loss while stealing her riches. Germany is represented by the woman who depends on others and cant communicate, and also takes breadsticks from Abigail. China is Abigail, who can make her own food(chinese manufacturing), and will use it to gain power and influence. Carl and Nelson(the black dude) are Africa who is getting investments from China, and new generation of Europe, who is dependent on(got in bed with) China and ashamed of it. They both have a taste of the \"free breadsticks\" and cant stop consuming them.          \n In the end, Abigail(China) doesnt want Yaya leave because she would lose her power.",

Some interesting things about the lists:\n\n1. Wes Anderson has all French movies on his list, which makes sense considering his most recent movie. \n2. Mike Leigh included the movie *How a Mosquito Operates*, which is a six minute animated film by Winsor McCay, of Little Nemo fame. \n3. Tsai Ming-Liang included his own movie *Goodbye, Dragon Inn*, which I thought was funny. But probably justified, although I've only seen *Rebels of the Neon God* myself. \n4. Martin Scorsese has fifteen movies on his list for some reason, probably due to his S&amp;S gold star membership. \n\nAnyway, there's a lot of movies I've never heard of here that I'm excited to check out, such as *Happy as Lazzaro* by Alice Rohrwacher and *La maison des bois*, a French miniseries by Maurice Pialat.",

It's definitely easier to properly balance a smaller ensemble, but I think Spielberg used his cast exceptionally well and delivered a compelling emotional impact.\n\nYou can read more of my thoughts on each film individually below:\n\n[Glass Onion (2022) - Review](https://www.popcornflicks.ca/wp/2022/11/30/glass-onion-2022-review/)\n\n[The Fabelmans (2022) - Review](https://www.popcornflicks.ca/wp/2022/12/03/the-fabelmans-2022-review/)\n\nWhich ensemble did you prefer between the two? Which do you think is going to win the SAG Award for Best Ensemble? Which do you think has a better chance in the Oscar race for Best Picture? Is there a third film you think did better with it's ensemble this season than either of these two? Interested to hear your thoughts!",

Merely hinting that something will happen doesn’t always enhance a narrative. \n\nHowever, Goodfellas contains a pretty impressive use of shot symmetry to establish a relationship between Henry’s behavior and the fear that it results in when he’s stuck in the witness protection program. The shot of Joe Pesci firing directly into the camera at the end of the film echoes the shot of Karen pointing a gun directly into the camera in an earlier scene. These two shots indicate a cause-effect pattern that is central to communicating Scorsese’s theme. \n\nScorsese doesn’t preach, but to those who fail to see the moral framework at the center of Goodfellas…I would argue that it’s definitely there. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lArU5rfrhtI",

Physics-defying feats are cool, but basic survival psychology-defying feats, like characters failing to truly fight for survival in a fight just so the protagonist can look cool and powerful, bother me. Shigurui, a manga with a great anime adaptation, is sort of what I have in mind as the ideal style of fighting I’m looking for here. \n\nAre there any good samurai films (or any Asian swords-based martial arts movies) that have more realistic, but still exciting, fights?",

        "text": "I recently re-watched Burn After Reading and I had this weird realization. Only the male characters suffer in the movie. The female characters are virtually unharmed and get what they want in the end. I love the movie and it's comedic genius, but please tell me if you feel the same.\n\nThere are seven main characters directly involved in the whole hustle:\n\n1. Frances McDormand - She works at a gym. Middle aged woman. Her main desire is to get cosmetic surgeries to get her youth back and start dating a nice guy.\n\n2. Brad Pitt - Also works at the gym. Good looking young guy. Kind of greedy.\n\n3. John Malkovich - CIA analyst. Fired from the job. Smart guy who is tired of the \"morons\" around him. Has a bitchy wife who is cheating on him.\n\n4. Tilda Swinton - Married to Malkovich's character. A pediatrician. Overall a bitchy, controlling wife who is cheating on her husband. \n\n5. George Clooney - A US marshall. Married guy who is cheating on his wife. Has an affair with Tilda Swinton's character.\n\n6. Elizabeth Marvel - Clooney's character's wife. An author. She is also cheating on her husband. She hires a law firm to get evidence of her husband's infidelity for divorce action.\n\n7. Richard Jenkins - Manager of the gym. Overall a nice guy. Has a crush on McDormand's character.\n\nNow out of these 7 main characters, except for Jenkins, most people are kind of assholes/cheaters.\n\n\\[Spoilers ahead\\]\n\nBUT only the men suffer in the whole movie.\n\n# Fate of the men\n\nBrad Pitt dies halfway through the movie while in Malkovich's house. \n\nJenkins who is a nice guy dies at the hands of a tired and pissed off Malkovich. \n\nMalkovich is killed by a confused CIA guy. \n\nClooney has divorce action initiated against him by his cheating wife. He tried to flee the country but gets picked up by the CIA. \n\n# Fate of the women\n\nMcDormand makes a deal with the CIA to get all the surgeries she desired. She suffers no consequences of her greed and gets what she wants in the end.\n\nSwinton is basically unharmed, her husband is killed whom she was tried to divorce anyway. She suffers no consequences of infidelity or bitchiness. \n\nElizabeth Marvel(The cheating wife of Clooney) is basically unharmed. Her divorce attorney has evidence against Clooney, so presumably she is going to get a good deal in her divorce. No consequences of cheating.\n\n# Summary\n\nI know the movie doesn't have any strong messages. But we do see that only men suffer in this Coen Bro's world. Doesn't matter if you are an asshole or a moron or a cheat or a moron or a good guy, but if you are a guy, you will pay. And Doesn't matter what kind of woman you are, you will get what you want.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "text": "**This is not meant to imply one way is better or worse than the other at all**. I'm only interested in if there is any sort of stylistic differences that tend to lean one way or the other. \n\nMy friend and I were watching the THR Roundtable on Screenwriters and noted that all but one of them present were either regular directors or had directing credits. I'm well aware there are lots of directors who don't write, and many screenwriters who never direct, but it was interesting to notice how heavily slanted that particularly roundtable was. This got us thinking, when watching movies by someone like Martin Scorsese (who has some co-writing credits but the bulk of his filmography he didn't write) and someone like Quentin Tarantino (who writes everything he directs): can you notice anything that distinguishes them? In an extreme way: could you *guess* that a film you've never seen before was written by the director or not based on something in the film? \n\nOne possibility we posited was that a lot of writer-directors have what we'd call \"witty\" or intricate dialogue. Quentin Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, Martin McDonagh etc. Whereas director-directors (the example we immediately went to was David Fincher) have a lot more \"vibe based\" film making. Lots of pauses, long slow sections with moody lighting or music. Very emotive framing of scenes without dialogue or these witticisms. Scorsese also falls into this latter example with Fincher; lots of big pauses, long no-talking stretches. Whereas non-dialogue sections in the former tend to be because of huge action or intricate comical moments. \n\nThese are obviously broad-stroke generalisations. And in each of these examples filmographies there's even contradictory examples. There's lots of people who fit into either category that could be examples of the opposite. But this was a 5 minute, far-too-late shower thought conversation.\n\n**But just for the fun of conversation**: Is there anything you've noticed? When you watch a film by someone who wrote it themselves like PTA do you pick up on certain things? When you watch a film that is based on someone's else's screenplay, is something missing or something new arises?",

        "text": "I want to first start off by saying if you haven't read the book. Please read that before you watch the movie. The book is one of the most beautiful things I've read. I've never read something more passionate and such a beautiful depiction of raw and true love. The book is from Elio's perspective and you are basically in his mind hearing all of his thoughts about Oliver. The poetry in this novel is heart breakingly moving and I highly recommend reading it. \n\nNow that I had finished reading now one of my favorite books, I was excited to see the movie which I had admittingly seen before but didn't enjoy. I thought it would be different now that I know more and was very disappointed. They left out so many crucial details in the story that are such key elements. I never heard them talking about \"heaven\", the place where they sit together almost every day in the summer, once. Along with so many other details that made this love story so beautiful was all the small things. The little romantic gestures. I also wish they did more voiceovers or showed Elio's diary more because I understand why so many people don't think the story is that romantic. The way they depicted it, it looks like Elio is just lustful over Oliver, and it's confusing when they start to say overly romantic things to each other. \n\nIn the novel, Elio talks about all of the small details he loves about Oliver and how he wants to take care of him, and how he is already his. He already gives himself to him without saying anything because he is so scared of his own emotions. Also, don't even get me started on the peach scene. \n\nThey didn't even show what makes the peach so erotic to Elio. To start to explain how important it is we need to discuss how when Oliver and Elio first have sex Oliver is creepy and when they are hooking up Elio starts to want to stop for a moment but the sex doesn't stop. It's weird because Oliver asks if he wants to stop but then it keeps going there were no verbal words just an energy where he starts to get uncomfortable and they both acknowledge it later. Elio talks about feeling gross and sticky and shame for it.  His girlfriend Mariza acts just as vulnerable and grossed out with Elio when they have sex. She gets scared and asks for reassurance and loves him deeply almost as much Elio does Oliver. Elio knows he is the Marizia to Oliver that she is to him. This idea scares him and when he ejaculates into the peach he talks about how the peach looks like a discarded rape victim and it reminds him of himself. \n\nThe peach's symbolism is shown when Oliver first starts staying with them there was a time when he was using the ladder to reach for a peach and while he is doing this Elio is watching him thinking about how the peaches remind him of Oliver's ass. Then Oliver hands him a peach which turned him on and made him flustered because the simple gesture of handing him the peach was something he could hold onto, since now in his mind the peach represents Oliver's ass. In giving this \"body part\" it would be unknowingly giving a part of himself to him which Elio goes on about how little Oliver knows about how much it means to him. Literally grasping for anything. Then later in the novel when he is using the peach to finish he starts talking about, not only does it remind him of Oliver but of Mariza. And then while using the peach starts making up a story about how the peach is actually the fruit of a woman trapped in a tree. \n\nThen Oliver comes into the room later in the evening and eats it. This is the most romantic gesture in the novel because this is a part of their I am you, you are me bond. He eats it to break barriers and to have a part of Elio in him. Elio talks about how this act was more passionate than anytime they ever had sex. They also didn't show Oliver getting married when the book it ends when there in the there mid to late 40s. I hated how they skimped out on so many details and I wish I could've directed it.",

        "text": "Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear seems to me to be showing a kind of resurrection of Max Cady, but in contrary to what Christ’s was. After 14 years, he came to Sam as a devil with new divine powers, though it is hard to say who actually the devil is in that movie, and tried to make that very world as a hell for him. The point of notice is Scorsese’s depiction of Cady’s psychology, making him to say “I’m as big as my God, and my God is as small as me” (I do not claim to have quoted in verbatim, but I have gathered it is from Silesius’) and to enjoy the pain, be it be of others or his himself. \n\nAt the end when Cady was about to drown\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ctyDL-6f90w\n\nAt time 1:21, he began to speak something which doesn’t seem to be a human language, and it has been reported that those sounds were not in script for Robert DeNiro, Bob did it on his own. If we invoke the subject of Scientific Psychology here, every sound we humans make have an associated idea with it in our mind; though it cannot be completely argued that the idea occurs first and the sound follows, but it is sure that every sound is associated with an idea (that is, they can be simultaneous). So, if Max was well versed with human language, and could very well express himself (his ideas) why he needed to resort to such strange sounds? He was well versed in Roman Catholic rules and Bible, he could before dying utter prayers to God, but it seems that Todestrieb (Freud’s concept of death drive) and diffusion was welcomed by him! Those sounds transcended his old Self-consciousness, thus were not associated with any ideas.",

        "text": "Question About Ford’s “The Searchers”\n\nWhy is this film considered as a top 50 (even top 10) film of all time? I’m pretty sure it’s because it serves as a placeholder for John Ford / John Wayne westerns (you can’t insert an entire genre into a list of greatest films, so The Searchers fills in the category of 1950s American westerns, for example). But while that is understandable, I don’t feel like the western genre from Hollywood’s Golden Age is influential enough to warrant a longstanding placeholder within the rankings of cinema’s greatest films. \n\nMoreover, even within the western genre, I feel like there are far superior entries. Once Upon a Time in the West is the most obvious - you can tell within a few short minutes of viewing that film that it’s a more sophisticatedly crafted film. Liberty Valance and even No Country for Old Men stand out as far superior genre entries, but by no means would I nominate them as top 50 films of all time. So The Searchers’ ever present position within critics’ lists just seems very strange.\n\nAm I missing something? Please let me know what I am not cognizant of. Thanks y’all!",

I must admit that I am sort of a big fan of this subreddit and how people here can have more in-depth civil discussions about films and sometimes even TV shows, which inspired me to write my first short essay about one of my most favorite television series, Daredevil, which I only recently finished. I know, this may seem a bit generic, considering that it's a superhero show, and my choice of a subreddit looks strange from the first glance, but, unfortunately, there is no television equivalent of r/TrueFilm and I am craving for more intellectual breakdowns, which are usually absent in other subs. I believe that any good film or a TV show of any genre deserves to be broken down and analyzed and I certainly would like to do just that with Daredevil, which I hold close to my heart, while recognizing it's flaws. \n\nSo, as we are done with the introduction, let's move to my question. This is my first short \"essay\" and I have zero experience with analyzing a film or a television beyond layman discussions with my friends and family members. I don't whether I make separate posts breaking down each season of Daredevil or cram all of them into onу short essay?",

Wilder was an Austria-Hungarian Jew who left Germany for Paris and later moved to the U.S. (in 1933, the year that Hitler became Chancellor). There can be no doubt that Wilder was keenly aware of Linbergh's hateful ideologies. He vigorously opposed McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee. I don't get it. Any thoughts?

(I’d never heard of it until a few years ago). Votes are public, and I believe many critics are under pressure to have female and black directors on their top ten list. *Beau Travail* (Claire Denis, 1998) is also in the top ten of all time. I assume there will be a correction in ten years when the current identity politics crazed has fizzled out somewhat. One voter had only films by female directors in her top ten, which is nakedly disingenuous and political.\n\nNo Terence Malick or Paul Thomas Anderson on the list. *Lawrence of Arabia* dropped out of the top 100.\n\nSome very interesting details in it, despite everything.",

This isn't an ad, just genuinely one of my favorite film podcasts out there. They've been going through the 2012 S&amp;S list and I'm assuming they'll switch over to the new list shortly. I think they strike a really nice balance between being casual but really knowing their stuff. Anyone else listening? Would love to discuss their takes on a handful of movies.",
