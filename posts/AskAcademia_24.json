I cant really focus when im so sleepy like this. The rest of the day could be fine, but when I get in the exam its really hard, then my mind just wants to sleep. \n\nIts so annoying. Sleep is so annoying, and I hate sleep. Last night I was supposed to cram I.T because I didnt have the time to study. Guess what? When I was about to start, I fell asleep. One moment I want to study, the next moment it's 4:50am in the morning. Wow...",

I needed a good score on this to keep my grade in the class. I was taking the quiz and doing fine but one of the questions had a word in it that I didn’t know (it wasn’t a nursing term, literally just a word in the english language). I was pretty confident on my answer but wanted to find out what that word meant to see if it made a difference, so I googled it. Finding out what the word meant didn’t change the answer I was going to pick, but just kind of reassured me that I was right. When I told my friend this, she was like “omg that’s cheating” and saying how I should feel bad. Should I feel bad about this? I just googled the definition of a word, not the question, and the definition didn’t even change my answer. \n\nI ask for clarification on questions all the time when we take exams in person, so I didn’t think this was any different I guess, since it’s something the professor would have likely answered for me.",

It's a rather ambiguous and colonial term that simply describes Indigenous people's of the far-north in a pejorative manner, and groups together the distinct Indigenous groups that are Inuit and Yupik. \n\nConsidering that, would it be appropriate to mark the use of \"eskimo\" with \\[sic\\]? It's not something that is relevant to my research to include a paragraph explaining its problematic history, so would a simple \\[sic\\] be sufficient or is this something worth explaining in the footnotes?",

        "text": "I am normally a calmn person but I am finding myself angry at a student for a nonsensical reason.  \n\n\nI am teaching a CS course. In this course we provided undergrads with a template in Javascript so that they could do a demo. The assignment uses a sophisticated data structure that is common in geometry processing that we provided students so that they can do their assignment.  \n\n\nUsing the DS is not complicated but it takes a lot of effort and care to make it work properly which is why we give it to them instead of asking them to code it.  \n\n\nOne student came during office hours to ask for help, and I am more than happy to help them out. I went over multiple examples on paper on how the algorithm they need to implement works. I suggested multiple different possible implementations to see if one would click. I asked the student to walk me over a few steps of what they should do, to try to gauge what they were confused about.  \n\n\nThis student is a PhD candidate taking an upper year undergrad course as part of their degree, take this into consideration for what I am about to describe, this is not a first year undergrad but someone who already graduated and is at the PhD level (albeit in a different discipline to mine).  \n\n\nAfter an hour of trying to help the student understand the assignment they said two things in that conversation that struck a cord in me (politely, the student was never rude in any way).   \n\n\n1) Can I get extra marks for making a writeup of what I understand about the assignment?  \n\n\nWhich absolutely not, the course is about application and being able to code the algorithm, failing to implement the algorithm (which many other students have implemented) is a failure in the assignment, period, why would you be entitled to marks for a writeup when there is no written component to the assignment?  \n\n\n2) They mentioned that they were struggling for time and they thought they might not finish the assignment (not asking for an extension, they just mentioned it as part of the conversation and did not dwell on it, they did not ask for any additional considerations). And they also said that to \"understand the algorithm\" they would code the entire thing in python (without a 3D visualizer like the one we gave them for js), without the sophisticated data structure they are supposed to use (i.e. he wants to brute force the solution in python without any acceleration queries). I tried to gently advice them to not waste their time and just sit down and understand the assignment proper.  \n\n\nI did not say anything in that hour, but even though it's been hours I am so... angry? Like I want to shout at this student and tell them they are being positively stupid. They want to waste hours of their time replicating 10% of the assignment (the result), when the whole point is for us to test them on their use of the data structure. Understanding the data structure IS the assignment, if you get it you can get the solution in 30 minutes. They are a PhD student in a subdiscipline of CS, I feel they should be embarrassed to be scared of properly learning the course material and finding copouts and crutches to get by instead of properly studying.  \n\n\nBut I have no stakes on this, if they fail the assignment it's on them, not on me. Why am I so upset at this student self sabotaging by not realising they are using python as an unhealthy coping mechanism to not deal with the anxiety of learning new languages and algorithms?  \n\n\nHave others felt this way? Is this normal? Do I need to seek counselling? I have never gotten so angry at someone over something so inconsequential to my own status.",

Am I able to look for work elsewhere if I wanted to? If I take this job and stop working for my professor, will I still be able to keep working on my master's thesis?

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nFirst post here. Some background:\n\nI completed a B.Sc in chemistry (4 years) and a PhD in synthetic methodology (6 years). I am now in a postdoc position doing drug discovery/medicinal chemistry (currently in 3rd year). About halfway through graduate school I found myself incredibly burnt out and miserable, but I pushed through, hoping a postdoc would be better. Now that I'm there, although I am in a lab with plenty of funding, have an understanding boss, work decent hours and have a successful project, I'm still quite miserable and burnt out. I am sick of grind - not necessarily from the hours, but from the nature of the work itself and the demands of the academic environment. Everything always seems urgent and I spend my working hours scrambling around lab, trying to get as much done as possible. I don't have any desire to go to seminars to learn about anything new. I've lost my belief in the value of \"science for science's sake\".\n\nI've followed this career path for nearly 13 years now, all the while believing the next position would finally give me what I was looking for. But I'm beginning to see maybe this career choice is just not for me. I do have a few remaining \"what ifs\". What if it's not chemistry that I dislike, but rather academia? What if it's bench chemistry that I dislike, and I'd find a management role more enjoyable? What if bench chemistry in industry (pharma/biotech) would be better than academia? I have no reference other than being a bench chemist in academic labs, so I can't answer these questions.\n\nAs I'm nearing the end of my postdoc I am beginning to consider alternative career options outside of the traditional career choices for a synthetic chemist (which are process chemistry or pharma/biotech). Here is what I've heard of so far:\n\n\\-Patent law (this is a hard no for me because of the demands)\n\n\\-Regulatory affairs (I have no idea what this is, but it's something I've heard in passing)\n\n\\-Government job (EPA, R&amp;D, and more)\n\n\\-Medical/technical writing (I also don't know much about this one)\n\nHonestly, I just want to do my 40 hours/week in a role that is not so stressful/hurried and enjoy my life outside of work. Why does it seem like I am the only one who feels this way? It seems like everyone around me is so invested in the grind and becoming a \"respected scientist\". I've seen that even 40 hrs/week in a demanding and busy role wreaks havoc on one's mental health and peace of mind.\n\nI apologize for the rant, but I'm feeling pretty trapped in this career right now.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of alternative career options for someone with my background/skillset? For those who went on to pharma/biotech after academia, does it get better? Can anyone relate to the falling out with the mission of science? I welcome any and all feedback.",

I am doing well in all but my heart lies with clinical work as I want to change the world in a positive way with mental health. \n\nFirst, do I sound like a competitive applicant for a top clinical PhD program, and is pursuing a PhD worth it in the long run over the psyd? I don’t have money to pay for a psyd and will look to have my PhD funded. I plan to take the GRE in the spring although I am not great with standardized testing so this worries me as a potential reason for a grad school to decline me.

        "text": "TLDR: sister is good in humanities courses (has an easy 4.0 through ~3 semesters), worked hard to submit an essay that met the assigned instructions, and was stunned to receive a 33%.\n\nMy sister was sobbing after getting a 33% on a term paper in an online introductory level philosophy course at a community college. The essay submitted was on topic, cited source materials, and was well written in terms of grammar and essay structure. Broadly speaking, the negative feedback from the professor said her points were too basic/superficial, that she didn't do a required part of the assignment*, and that she didn't display a mastery level of the philosophical subject. There was also a smug line at the end about how she squandered her one opportunity to improve her grade by forgoing the extra credit assignment. \n\nThere were two immediately glaring issues with the professor's feedback: *1) the requirement which he said was missing was in fact in the essay using different examples than what he suggested in his critique (if these were factually wrong and entirely indefensible as justifications, he didn't acknowledge that much less explain why), and 2) she did do the extra credit essay and submitted it as he requested - it was literally in the same document as the main essay. \n\nI don't see how he has any credibility to provide a grade for this paper. He paid so little attention to what he was grading that he didn't even realize there was another essay in the document! By his own admission in the critique, he seems to have missed details in the essay he actually managed to grade. He's set his anchor so low that even if he \"generously\" doubled the grade it'd still be a D, and he comes across as kind of an egotistical asshole such that my expectation is he will do whatever he can to preserve his incorrect grade rather than admit he was mistaken.\n\nFrankly I can't fathom how he arrived at 33%. My experience through college, grad school, and living in American society has led me to believe that generally at worst one would get a D for submitting an essay that was on topic, fulfilled the requirements, and was written in proper English. Am I just off base here? If she had gotten a C I would have thought she could complain but that perhaps she hadn't understood the material very well and that it was a defendable grade. A 33% though? I've never heard of something like that... especially in a community college introductory course.\n\nI wanted to reach out here (not sure if there's a better place to post this) to get some context to my reaction and to see how to proceed. Does anyone else have experience with a grade this low on an essay? I assume this will lead to a grade dispute, so is there any advice on how to proceed with that, such as asking for:\n\n* exactly how many points each grading criteria was worth and a breakdown of where she lost points;\n* the distribution of grades for the whole class on the assignment;\n* a mechanism to prove that her grade was deserved in the context of the other grades (I'm confident nothing would be done in this area but I'm dying to see what other people handed in, especially if they did so much better than her as to get a C or D);\n* anything else?",

The comparison is about which process is more efficient and if the new one might be more environmental and economical.\n\nThe thing I'm stuck on is the required energy for the standard process. It's not a single defined synthesis sequence, but instead I'm pulling different literature processes together into a \"this is what's commonly done for each step\" sequence.\n\nOne example is the synthesis of 3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, which I know is done by adding 3-nitrobenzene into chlorosulfonic acid at elevated temperature. However, to calculate how much energy I need to heat the chlorosulfonic acid, I need the specific heat capacity, which I can't find.\n\nThere's a few more processes like that, leading to the problem that I only have enough data to calculate the energy requirements for about half the steps. My PI has said it's my entirely call, which (while nice) doesn't really help.\n\nOne one hand, adding the information would be good to get at least a ball park figure on where we're heading and to allow for a better comparison. On the other hand, this seems like a super shady comparison, since I'm lacking so much data and may lead to the wrong conclusion. \n\nRight now I'm leaning towards not adding the energy calculations and just going by the amount of chemicals used, but I'm not sure. \n\nAny ideas or suggestions?",

I have 2yrs of experience, a good, polished skillset with new ones being developed every year and all that jazz. But when it comes to studies, I've never EVER in my ENTIRE LIFE, right from preschool all the way to the recent first semester mid-terms in the grad school \\[MS biotech\\] that I'm in right now, score a 100% in ANYTHING. Assignments, quizzes, presentations, written exams (be it descriptive or MCQ), oral exam, projects, or anything else.\n\nI observe the people around me to maintain a healthy level of awareness and improve my own approach to studies. I go through the textbook, running notes written in class, lecture recordings, youtube vids, research articles, explanatory blogs and if possible additional reference books and prepare a jist full of flowcharts for every exam and I cover all syllabus and revise it atleast twice or thrice.  \n\nMost people that I observed tend to go through the presentation a day or two before the exam and directly write the exam. no notes, no watching vids on YouTube, I have rarely seen people go through textbooks and reference books. When I ask them why they stick to the basics its apparently \"not necessary\" because its \"easy\".\n\nThis is infuriating beyond comprehension because I've never felt any subject to be easy, EVER!\n\nAll the effort I invest and the most I get out of it is between 70s(2.5) or 80s(3). never a 100.\n\nI will take full responsibility and implement any changes necessary to score more but that's the thing. I'm doing everything I can, and my peak performance seems like below average in comparison to people who are Acing every single exam/assignment with ease. \n\nI am ok with the universal fact that 'no matter how much you try some people are just better'.\n\nWhat I'm having a hard time processing is the fact that no matter how much effort I put in and how many skills I built, I haven't (technically and quantitatively) improved! Its so frustrating!!!\n\nBy the way, grades don't matter only if you have good ones. For getting into PhD or applying for a job in academia my grades (which have been near 80% on average) are laughable. So, this plateau in grades throughout my life is actually limiting the possibility of accomplishing my dream which is to be a scientist/professor and have my own lab based on stem cell research.\n\nDoes anybody relate to any of this?\n\nAnyways thank you for taking your time to read this:) all the best for your studies/work :)\n\nPS: I hope everybody who cheats in their quizzes, assignments and exams gets pancreatic or colon or brain cancer, don't get diagnosed until it metastasizes to an untreatable degree and have a long life full of suffering.",

Prior to the deadline, I exhausted all means to contact the foreign guy about the documents that they need to sign for the grant application. Apparently, he forwarded the documents to the more senior people in their end and these people are having a hard time deciding on who will be the signatory.

I appealed to the grant office to give us an extension and the deadline is coming up again but the co-adviser seems to be avoidant now.

I thought my supervisors were great but turns out they were some of the worst bullies I have ever met. I tried hard to stay in the PhD, passed my first year viva which is done by non-experts BUT my supervisors explicitly said in their report, that they didn't think I could do a PhD. Long story short, the department tried to find me a new supervisor but they failed so after a year and a half I was basically let go. \n\nI decided to do a PGCE so I can make money and support myself and future studies. However I was accepted NOWHERE for a PhD, I applied so many times. I realized that being outside of academia for so long was a big problem so I decided to do a masters. \n\nI just completed a 2 year part time masters (which I paid entirely on my own, working full time as a science teacher) and now I am applying again for PhDs. \n\nMy advisor told me there's no need at all to mention the previous PhD, it's unrelated to any future endeavors. ( I was previously told I had to mention it, I am sure mentioning it though has counted against me.) \n\nI have been sending applications and I feel rather confident but also, so afraid that I won't be accepted anywhere. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with feelings of negativity/inadequacy and has anyone been a similar situation? How easy was it for you to get accepted to a new PhD? \n\nI am already thanking you in advance for taking the time to read all of this, any advice will be greatly appreciated!",

I looked through some databases regarding professors' salaries, mainly assistant professors in Math/Stats, some of which are specific to the universities, and a few of them from R1 universities have like 88K - 92K (there is one famous school with 105K). I understand that professors are usually on a 9-month appointment, at least in Math/Stats, but from time to time, I hear people saying that upon receiving the offer, one can negotiate for a 2-month summer salary; alternately, the professors can apply for grants and use them to pay for their summer or their own departments may have some sort of small incentive grants for summer research (says $5,000). I guess if it is summer salary that one negotiates or earns through teaching summer courses, the salary reports should already include those. But if that is the case, 88K - 92K seems a bit modest to me (well granted, those I looked at are mainly in the South around my own institution; one in the Midwest), especially at an R1 university. I am just not sure about grants because, at an R1 university, applying for grants should be more active. \n\nAs someone who is looking into academia, I really want to learn more about these salary matters. I don't expect going into academia to make tons of money, but at the very least, I hope to be able to buy a small house and can spend on groceries a bit more comfortably than I am now as a PhD student (and for some personal reasons, I don't think I will have a spouse any time soon, so I really cannot rely on another one's income). To that end, I am also very interested in how to earn a bit more as an assistant professor.\n\nPlease give me some insights! Thank you so much.",

Confused I contacted the editors and on further inquisition, turns out they were including references into the mix as well, bringing up the total percentage of plagiarism to 37%. I tried to reason with them saying references are not usually included in the plagiarism check, but to no avail. They cited editorial policy changes and stuff like that. \n\nAt the same time, I was on clock and needed a proof of acceptance of a manuscript for grant continuation, so pulling out the submission was not an option at this stage. \n\nSo here is how i solved the issue. \n\n1. I had few references in french and german - translated them to English\n2. Used abbreviation for journal names - American Journal of NeuroRadiology became AJNR. \n3. Shorter forms for journal names - every journal with \"international\" in it became int., computer science became Comp. Sci., neuroscience became neurosci. So on and so forth. \n\nThings you can not mess with volume, issue, year, page number and DOI. Rest you can play around with as long as you do not overdo it. \n\nOne more thing to note here is that i use endnote as my reference manager, so i had to edit the references in endnote one by one. It was a bit tiring but there's no way around it. \n\nMy submission now had been approved by the editors, and sent for double blind peer review. Wish me luck.",

I don't have any 1st  author publications, but I will most likely have one by the end of the  summer (maybe two). I could graduate at the end of the summer, but my  advisor gave me the option of staying an extra semester or year as he  offered to write me a letter of rec if I want to apply for postdocs  which I would apply next Fall (I didn't apply this round). I wanted to  ask what would the better option be: graduate as soon as possible which  would be by the end of the summer or stay an extra semester or two while  applying for postdocs and getting more research/publications under my  belt? I would also be able to travel more for conferences if I stayed  around a little longer.\n\nI was  thinking of staying  for an extra semester or year which would be the  best for my career and  my advisor agrees. I just wanted some input if  this is the most sound  decision. I don't want to publish a bad thesis  which I feel I would if I  graduated in the summer. I feel like an extra  semester at least would  give me some breathing room to write something  of substance.",

        "text": "I am taking an online intro psychology class with a professor I'd actively sought after seeing good reviews for her on RateMyProfessor. The class has been beyond disappointing for several reasons:\n\n* NO lectures from the professor. Instead, she posts links to the videos put out by the Crash Course YouTube channel \n* Syllabus says weekly quizzes, exams, discussion posts, assignments, projects are each worth 20% of our final grade. When asked, she said course grades aren't weighted. This means each exam (there are 3 total, each covering as many as 6 chapters) is worth only 2% of the total grade. She only clarified this to me via email, and only when I explicitly asked, and not to other students.\n* Syllabus says weekly discussion posts will be graded with feedback and engagement within 1 week of due date. It's December now and no submissions have been graded since Sept. The 3 posts that have been graded were graded months late and with NO feedback and surprisingly tough grading. (e.g. it's a freshman-level course; I was a former English major and have worked proofreading Ph.D. papers and received a 70% on one submission) With seven other submissions waiting to be graded, students didn't have a chance to refine those posts in response to her grading. \n* Syllabus says assignments will be graded with feedback. None have been graded. \n* Syllabus said the first exam would cover chapters 1-5. It ended up only covering chapters 1-4. \n* The \"study guide\" she posted for the first exam was just a list of multiple-choice questions from prior exams. 90% of the questions covered only one of the four chapters. \n* The Canvas announcement said the second exam would cover chapters 6-10. I asked her about chapter 5, which we hadn't been tested on. She emailed me that the second exam would cover chapters 5-9 and gave me the date.  She then gave the exam one week early and covered chapters 5-10. \n* She said a final assignment would be assigned a month ago. It still hasn't been assigned, but she's now changed it to say it will be \"peer-reviewed,\" which means students will grade each other. The other \"big\" assignment, due 2 months ago, was also peer-reviewed. Grades for it still aren't posted. I emailed to ask her how/if the peer-reviewed portion was to be graded (I spent an hour on it). She never responded. \n* Our final discussion post was also changed to be \"peer-reviewed,\" which, again, just means we are grading it for her. She noted to fill out the grading rubric. But the rubric includes an area to grade the discussion AND the response—but there is no response assigned to grade. It is due tomorrow and she still has not responded. \n\nThe only thing she has done all semester is copy/paste from the textbook onto Canvas and she's graded Discussion posts through September, giving no feedback. There are 8 weeks of ungraded discussion posts and all assignments that aren't auto-graded through the textbook software are left to \"peer-review,\" which was a thoroughly unexplained practice that basically amounts to us grading each other so she doesn't have to. \n\nI've had other online courses with instructors who didn't post lectures, but who engaged with the class--posting highlights from people's contributions, sharing personal notes about that week's subject, and assigning papers that they responded to and engaged with. \n\nThis professor has everything either auto-graded (textbook software assignments and exams) or peer-graded (non-textbook assignments and some discussions). She's given arbitrary grades for a handful of discussion posts. My brother is a college professor and was aghast when I told him about this class. \n\nOur grades online are incorrect, with some things being counted twice. It works out in my favor, so I'm not bringing it up, but it's also inexcusable. \n\nI'm clearly pissed: I rearranged my class schedule to take a class with this professor, but she definitely doesn't care about her students. She is an adjunct instructor who lives in a different city than the college, 7 hours away. \n\nWould any good come from emailing her after the class to, diplomatically, express my disappointment? Or would any good come from emailing the department chair at the university? The dean?",

I really am interested in science and scientific career, although it is very hard to accomplish it here in Brazil (and I already have my plan B), but my problem for the last two or three years is: I can't decide which area I want to study! And it is driving me crazy, I frequently feel anxiety and have crises.  \nMy doubt is mainly between the area I am currently in (cancer and cell biology) and evolution, something more nature-ish and with field trips, and catching birds to study them (I really like birds). For the past three years, I have been working with cells, and also with cancer for the past two years. I really love cell biology, and it is actually the reason why I entered Biology graduation and kept going. But over the years I also fell in love with every single aspect of nature, in particular genetics, evolution and birds. Now I just graduated, and I can't decide which Major I apply to. My supervisor really likes me and my work, and he expects me to stay there, so I also feel guilty that I didn't yet tell him about my doubts. Sometimes my doubt and my anxiety is so, so strong I feel depressed and having really dark thoughts, which really worry me.  \nI already thought of taking a break and experimenting in another lab that studies evolution, but I am afraid I might regret it and my supervisor won't accept me again (and I really like the field I am studying now)  \nI am also worried I might study for several years and dislike what I am doing. I am so afraid. I am afraid I cannot change areas in the future if I regret.  \nAlso worried to get too old and can't changes areas, or can't find a job.  \nAny leads to help me? I already am having therapy, but it is a long process and my therapist is not always available — and I am feeling anxious now.\n\nHas anyone else also felt so undecided and so many doubts?

This is because the Mphil program would issue a certificate only if candidates do NOT proceed into the PhD program. Would this be acceptable for PhD grad admissions?",
