Unable to separate them, and perplexed as to what to do next, although it was late, she called the vet.   He answered in a very grumpy voice.   Having explained the problem to him, the vet said, \"Hang up the phone and place it down alongside the dogs.   I will then call you back and the noise of the ringing will make the male lose his erection and he will be able to withdraw.\"   \"Do you think that will work?\" she asked.\n\n\"It just worked for me,\" he replied.",
