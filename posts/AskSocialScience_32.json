        "text": "Hi ASS, I don't watch a lot of TV but have an interest in what I perceive to be a resurgence in film &amp; TV that feature \"ironic existential heroes,\" protagonists who wrestle with existential themes. This isn't anything new, but what I've noticed with the characters above is that:\n\n* Failure is endemic; the characters never fully accept their existential responsibility for their own happiness and repeatedly fall back in to unhappiness. In super hero movies, this is often a \"return to reclusiveness\" at the film's conclusion. (Compare to say Finn from Adventure Time, who accepts his existential quest).\n* The characters tend to indulge in typically masculine forms of distraction or self-abuse (e.g. drugs, sex, alcohol).\n* The characters tend to be financially well off or highly successful in some endeavour or another.\n* They are almost always male.\n* They often abuse those they love/those who love them.\n* The audience is generally encouraged to identify with these characters; there is no process of \"de-identification\" or critical reframing of them (as there is in say Robert Deniro's character in Taxi Driver)\n\nLike I said, I don't watch a lot of TV but this seems to be a pattern. Is there any critical thought, I think particularly from a feminist standpoint, that might explain our modern fascination with these characters?",

        "text": "\"The Meidner Plan was proposed by Rudolf Meidner and his colleagues in the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1978. The Meidner plan established so-called \"wage earner funds,\" which were simply stock holding companies. Each year, large companies (those with over 50 employees) would be forced to disburse a small percentage of their profits in the form of new shares to the wage earner funds, which were to be controlled by the company's workers. These new shares would be the same as any other shares in the company: owning 10% of the shares of a company, for example, entitles a shareholder to 10% of the company's profits and 10% of votes on the company's board of directors. Slowly--over the course of several decades--all large companies would transition from shareholder control to worker control. With ownership of more and more shares, a company's workers would have a slowly increasing influence over the company's management and entitlement to its profits, eventually controlling a majority of shares. These shares could never be sold and would always be controlled by workers via the wage earner funds. Shareholders would never completely lose their share in the company, but their influence and entitlement to profits would slowly dilute until workers had a controlling share\"\n\nhttp://persistenceofpoverty.blogspot.ca/p/blog-page_15.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehn%E2%80%93Meidner_model\n\n",

What I am asking is whether there is a possible connection among these crimes? Perhaps were they planned by some organised criminal collective unconscious? If so, why?\n\nIs it possible that they are done by a collective minority who demand to be recognized becuase of the sheer amount of anti-refugee, anti-Muslim and anti-minority propoganda and mentality in the UK? Is it possible that it is a form of revenge or recognition after all the prejudice and misjudgement that they got from most of the British? And I will say most becuase not all of them have the same mentality. Or are they done by different people with different motivations? *(which makes me wonder and question how well-maintained the security is in the UK)*\n\nAnd please don't say it is ISIS. It is way too easy to blame on the notorious terrorist group. But if so, it would be better to back up that claim with some evidence",

Other stores might be run just as much by community members, but with a more hostile or contentious atmosphere.\n\nPart of it in my view is that corporate stores aren't seen as part of the community as much as stores with local flavor are, and part of that in my view is the corporate motivation to make the experience about the same everywhere. Corporate coffee shop and bookstore locations actually have variability, though. But many places I've been to seem to have a lack of community sense.

        "text": "Is it possible to test for empathy? From what I can see in the Wikipedia article there seems to be some merit to the idea that women are more empathic than men but I'm wondering if there is more comprehensive data. I'd like to see comparisons between different occupational groups, age groups, nationalities, neurological conditions, criminal offenders and income groups. I'd like to see what people are more or less empathic towards, wether it's babies, animals, friends, parents, coworkers, movie heroes etc.\n\nAre these tests for empathy not reliable enough or is it just a touchy subject? Why, for example, aren't we testing for empathy in police officers?",

I'm thinking that the use of certain language helps people identify the groups they belong in, and that propagating coded-language helps solidify the group identity. \n\nFor example, the military speaks a particular type of english that involves lots of jargon, acronyms, and inside jokes (I'm assuming). My thought is that not only does the language make communication within the group easier, but that it serves as a type of indoctrination and aids with group solidarity. This probably works the same way with churches (common mantras, greetings), political movements (where my research is focused, but I'm drawing blanks), and cults.\n\nI'm positive I'm not the only one who's had this thought, but I honestly have little knowledge of Sociology and Group Psychology because my studies are focused on political science.  \n\nAnything will help- thanks!",
