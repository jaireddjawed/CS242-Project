The cons are that it is the least well-compensated (about 15k less) because of a quirk of the program.

I know people say that everyone tends to do better after the first semester but idk if that's a natural thing or if I should be making a lot of changes as to how I approach school.\n\nThanks so much for any advice!!!",

So, is Louisiana's legal system really all that different from the other 49 states, and more similar to that of European civil law, or is it just a slight difference but a big enough one to say that it's different?\n\nAlso, this:\n\n&gt;The resulting system of \"civil law\" in the Louisiana does differ from the \"common-law\" systems in the other 49 states.\n\nsource: https://www.louisiana.gov/about-louisiana/",

However, it may depend on what specific career path you want. My dad's advice was to go with the degree in business instead of economics, due that he works on the business sector and can help me create my own path.\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has completed either of these programs or has experience working in the related fields.

One is local to me, ranked lower overall on U.S. News and didn’t offer me any scholarships. However, they rank higher in areas such as trial advocacy, criminal law, etc, which is what I’d like to practice. The other one is out of state, but offered me a significant scholarship, cost of living is overall cheaper in that area, and is ranked higher on USN. However, School No. 2 ranks lower in areas of trial advocacy, criminal law, etc. \n\nI also know that USN was getting some shit for their ranking system so I know their reliability has been debated. \n\nI’m just hoping for some insight. Obviously these are not your T14 schools and I’m under any delusion I’ll be BL eligible, but that was never my goal anyway. That being said, when it’s T100 school level, should I still be taking rankings into consideration? Or should I be more concerned about financial burden overall? Does it even matter at this level? \n\nGenuinely have no clue as to how to weigh these decisions, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone!",

I'm aware that 1L summer doesn't really matter as long as you do something legal-related, and (I assume) there's already a pretty big gap between being an SA and... everything else... but I've also heard mixed things about being an RA (often a last resort, OCI firms look down on it, etc.)\n\nThe thing is, this position seems like a really good opportunity, potentially much better than a generic RA:\n\n1. The research is in the area of law I want to specialize in (which prof is an expert in), and the final product will be a very substantive contribution to said area.\n2. Good relationship w/ professor, did well in their class, they are extremely well-known/respected in their field (named professorship, one of the longest-tenured at the school) , and they actually still practice for/engage with a BL firm. They have lots of contact with judges, partners, etc, in addition to academia.\n3. Explicitly stated that they want to introduce me to their professional network, in person. They went to a T14 in-state and presumably have tons of connections and proteges here.\n\nInitially I was stoked, but then I saw some posts ranking RA as the bottom of the barrel when it comes to 1L summer (aside from doing nothing law-related). I have interviews coming up for stuff like judicial internships (the best of which is with a state supreme court justice) and Fed/state agencies (no federal DOJ though), and I'm unsure whether I should be taking this RA position and running.\n\n**TL;DR,** being offered a RA with a very well-connected prof, doing substantive research in the exact area I want to practice with; prof also wants to connect me w/ their network. Having second thoughts b/c unsure of how this will stack up, resume-wise, vs other non-SA positions.",
