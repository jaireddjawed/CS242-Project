Courts weigh privacy against other values, including the need to solve and prevent crimes. [...] Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety. [...] There is no constitutional right to sell warrant-proof encryption.\n\nThis seems to be a continuation of the previous administration's position on encryption, where the [FBI obtained a federal court](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/a-brief-explanation-of-apples-showdown-with-the-us-government.html) order compelling Apple to assist in gaining access to the San Bernandino shooter's iPhone.\n\nA number of technology companies have [spoken out against the government's position](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11156704/apple-fbi-amicus-briefs-iphone-encryption-fight), such as in this [amicus brief](https://www.scribd.com/doc/302014025/Apple-Brief-Of-Twitter-And-Other-Web-Companies?irgwc=1&amp;content=10079&amp;campaign=Skimbit%2C%20Ltd.&amp;ad_group=66960X1514734X5ff79d4452069ae5ad3fe358a8b51c1a&amp;keyword=ft750noi&amp;source=impactradius&amp;medium=affiliate) from Twitter, Reddit, CloudFlare, and others:\n\n&gt; If the government is able to compel companies to break their own security measures, the users of those companies will necessarily lose confidence that their data is being handled in a secure, open manner. [...] Technological backdoors, whether or not built for specific and supposedly limited purposes, create an opportunity for criminals and hackers to exploit.\n\nWhat are the merits of the arguments on both sides? Is there existing precedent to support the government's position? Have other countries implemented similar requirements, and if so how have those worked out?",

Currently, China is already the world's largest maker and seller of electric cars.\n\n&gt; Many outside China — including some members of President Trump’s administration — say China is using unfair government support to create national champions that could eclipse their rivals abroad.\n\n&gt; Chinese auto executives say their country is pursuing common-sense policies to develop cutting-edge industries.\n\n&gt; “In China, the entrepreneurs in the industrial sector are very lucky, because we have the foundation” from the government, said Li Bin, the founder and chairman of the NIO Company, a Chinese electric car manufacturer. “These opportunities are rare or impossible in any other country in the world.”\n\nWhile China's state sponsorship of electric cars is just one example, what are the pros and cons of state-sponsored capitalism? In what instances have similar policies produced positive outcomes? In what instances have they produced negative outcomes? Finally, what impact  do these practices have on other countries with more de-regulated approach towards capitalism?",

While, undoubtedly NFL teams have the right to dictate player behavior on (and off) the field, this right seems to have been complicated by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's actions and words. \n\nhttp://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20961541/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-says-player-disrespects-flag-play\n\nThere is evidence that President Trump is attempting to influence/encourage/suggest a change in NFL policy, per twitter @realDonaldTrump:\n\n&gt;Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912080538755846144?lang=en\n\n&gt;If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/911904261553950720?lang=en\n\nThis week Vice President Mike Pence publicly left an NFL football game after members of the 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.  This would appear to be a direct escalation and encouragement of Trump's above tweet encouraging a public boycott.  \n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/08/vice-president-mike-pence-leaves-colts-49ers-game-after-players-reportedly-kneel.html\n\nThere are also reports that President Trump called Jerry Jones 4 times the previous week, urging the owner 'not to allow his players to kneel' during the national anthem. \n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353362-trump-called-cowboys-jerry-jones-four-times-asking-him-not-to-kneel \n\n So, supposing a Cowboy player is punished next week for failing to express 'adequate' respect for the flag, what are the legal implications in terms of First Amendment rights?  Can we trace a clear path from the President's words to a private citizen's punishment?  At what point does pressure (on the part of the federal government through Trump's public advocacy) reach coercion?  Has public federal advocacy here exposed NFL owners to potential liability if they follow through?  Are the Cowboys uniquely exposed due to President Trump's personal involvement?",

        "text": "It seems that [Denmark](http://m.independent.ie/world-news/denmark-set-to-become-latest-european-country-to-ban-the-burqa-36203002.html) will become the latest country, joining France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and the German state Bavaria, to have some level of \"burqa ban\". Burqa bans, for the purposes of this question, include the legislation in France banning the wearing of face coverings in public(It's hard to find the text in english, but [this source](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-law-prohibiting-the-wearing-of-clothing-concealing-ones-face-in-public-spaces-found-constitutional/) gives \"The law reviewed by the Constitutional Council provides that 'no one, in a public space, may wear clothing intended to conceal the face.'\"), the potential ban in Denmark that is not written yet, but seems to be along the lines of the French one and any other legislation in western countries that has had similar effect(most burqa bans seem to be part of larger public face-covering bans). \n\nThe most stated popular reasonings behind the ban appear to be [social cohesion, or protecting women's rights](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/europe/burqa-burkini-bans/index.html) and [security, or the suppression of radical islam](http://www.newsweek.com/burqa-ban-european-peoples-party-france-582312), though some wearers of the garments say the problems are being made up.\n\nSo, before bans were put in place [around 2010-11](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline), was there any reason to believe that the bans would result in greater social cohesion, security, or women's rights? After the bans is there reason to believe the countries that implemented them have had greater security, social cohesion or women's rights than they would have had otherwise?",

        "text": "The context of this question is the deadly shooting Las Vegas, in which case [ISIS claimed responsibility] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting-islamic-state/islamic-state-claims-las-vegas-shooting-u-s-officials-skeptical-idUSKCN1C71SP), and [US officials didn't find any connection] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting/las-vegas-police-look-for-motive-in-deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-u-s-history-idUSKCN1C70FU).\n\nA popular reaction to ISIS claims, is that they often take responsibility for incidents they have no connection to. It is certainly a relevant question to ask if they took responsibility in the past for actions they had no connection to. I would like to see some examples of that.\n\nFor example the Mateen attack, he dedicated the attack to various terrorist groups, including ISIS. [In fact he did pledge his allegiance to ISIS.] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-omar-mateen-isis.html)\n\nFor me, I am more curious about examples of non Islamic terrorism, and I don't find it as important if the individual isn't part of an organization beyond being motivated by ISIS calls for violence. Nevertheless, someone else might approach this differently and you can show examples of ISIS claiming responsibility for any sort of Islamic terrorism too.\n\nThis question doesn't prove anything because the credibility of a mass murdering terrorist group is always in doubt, but it is still a relevant issue to examine, if nothing else, on a factual basis.",
