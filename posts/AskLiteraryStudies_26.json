        "text": "So, I'm reading the Bible for a class assignment (school doesn't start for a few months, but its a pretty hefty book, thought I aught to get a head start). I'm reading the King James Version, and slowly working my way through the Old Testament. I've already posed this question to a few Christian sub-reddits, but I'm interested in a more literary take. So here goes.\nI was reading Genesis 22:1-24, where Abraham goes to sacrifice Isaac to God, when I noticed that Isaac is referred to as Abrahams \"only son\" at Genesis 22:2. And this got me thinking, because Isaac is not Abraham's only son-- he has another son, Ishmael, born to Hagar, Sarah's slave when Sarah could not conceive. And although Isaac is the son through which all of Abrahams descendants will be named (Genesis 21:12), and this might make him Abrahams only true son, it does not make him Ahraham's only son. And this got me thinking-- Abraham was willing to sacrifice his \"only son\" to God. God sacrificed his only son, Jesus, so that we might have salvation. But Isaac is not Abraham's only son. He has an 'illegitimate' (for lack of a better term) son as well. So, my question is this-- is there such a thing as an illegitimate son of God (symbolically or otherwise)? My own small theory is that perhaps some prophet, perhaps John the Baptist (who was born before Jesus as Ishmael was Isaac), serves as a sort of illegitimate son of God, but I am not sure. Thanks so much for all the help.",

They then eventually progress to reading Lacan's own writings, which – depending on the text – can be a rather Herculean task. They would then move on to reading further developments by other authors in the wider field of Lacanian literary criticism, often debating about interpretations of the original text, as well as criticism of Lacan's theories from non-Lacanian scholars. All of this takes many hours of reading, and if at the end of it all one finds that Lacanian literary criticism simply isn't tenable, I can only imagine the frustration and resentment they would hold.\n\nDid you once invest a large amount of time and mental effort into understanding a theory or a theorist, only to find that the result did not justify the amount of input?\n\nIf so, what were your fundamental disagreements with the theory, such that many hours of reading failed to persuade?",

Yet Dickens was writing for people of this own time who would presumably be well aware of the environment in which they lived.  Or is it that his readers lived in such a different locations (geographically or socioeconomically) than his characters that the readers found this point of view as interesting and entertaining as we do today?  I guess another possibility is that the Victorian era of Dickens' fiction is just that - fiction - and Victorian readers were eager and happy to spend time in Dickens' altered reality.  I know that some of Dickens' work was deliberately expository but this question is directed more to the environmental subtext apart from the main themes of the works.  \n\nI am not even sure the question makes sense but if anyone else has thought of this or has any ideas I would be eager to hear them.",

In fact, excepting the PDF file, I can find no evidence at all that this particular edition ever existed. I don't even know the name of the translator. I've already emailed Wordsworth, and all they've really been able to tell me is that it may have gone out of print before the company began using computerized records, which is why there's no record of it.

This essay was written during WWI, so it must have something to do with early 1900s.\n\nQ2.\n\n\"Among the benefits which the war has brought to London, and a little less uncertain than some, is the log fire. In the country we have always burnt logs, with the air of one who was thus identifying himself with the old English manner, but in London never—unless it were those ship's logs, which gave off a blue flame and very little else, but seemed to bring the fact that we were an island people more closely home to us.\"\n\nCould anybody give me some explanation about what this paragraph means, especially about the last sentence?",

Because given the ability to read English there is something fundamental about this work that requires no particular indoctrination?\n\nAnd now muddling the question, is this just an aesthetic response, is it an \"I recognize something true\" response?

        "text": "Hi all! \n\nI am currently a junior undergrad in the US. I'm majoring in English, mostly focused on book history and medieval studies. I seriously struggle with writing for my English classes.\n\nBecause I spent much of my first two years in college in computer science and similar fields, I feel I've missed the development of writing skills that others had during that time. I recently applied to write a thesis in my department's honors program, and was almost rejected because my writing samples were just not up to snuff. This summer, as I begin my thesis work and also start thinking about graduate school, I desperately want to improve my academic writing in the humanities. \n\nOne problem I have identified, and please let me know if you think this is a legitimate concern, is that I have not *read* much in the way of literary criticism or... whatever else you might call writing about literature. I hope to read this summer to work on writing from the reading side. \n\nBut I turn to you all for advice as well-- how might I improve my academic writing in the humanities? How does one even develop a reading of a text? Write a compelling essay around that reading? Are there any books I can read this summer about how to write (or read)? So far, I have only come across Bloom's \"How to Read and Why,\" though I'm not sure how on the topic of critical reading it is.\n\nI feel like I missed a week in early undergrad where everyone learned these skills. I was never a bad writer before sophomore year of college. A good friend of mine (who is an absolutely *brilliant* scholar) told me once about how he learned to think about developing a reading of a text and writing an essay, and it blew my mind. I must ask him again to explain to me; all I remember right now is that, at some point, he said \"all good essays aspire to poetry.\"  \n\nForgive me if this is commonly asked-- I have searched through previous posts, but most seem to be about writing the sciences. \n \nTL;DR: Undergrad English major struggling to develop critical readings of texts and write essays. Suggestions for how to learn these skills? Exercises? Book recommendations? ",

        "text": "Martin Amis' Time's Arrow presents the story of Odilo Unerdroben, a former Nazi doctor who escaped to America at the end of the war. The text is presented as an inverted temporal narrative beginning at Unverdorben's death and ending at his birth. The narrator, a being inhabiting a space within Unverdorben, perceives a world in which effect precedes cause as travelling in the correct or forward temporal direction. The best example to demonstrate this can be seen in the narrator's negative perception of Unverdorben's actions as a doctor healing patients in America compared to his positive perception of his actions as a Nazi doctor in Auschwitz assisting Josef Mengele with his barbaric experiments and pouring the Zyklon B into the gas chamber. Viewed in reverse, healing looks like an act of violence whilst the brutality and destruction of the Holocaust looks like a utopian fantasy where a race is created from 'fire and shit'. \n  \nThe narrator, who can feel Unverdorben's emotions but cannot access his thoughts, has no agency to control the body he inhabits. He describes himself as a 'parasite' who can only witness Unverdorben's life in reverse, not alter it. So, what the hell kind of narrator is this guy? They inhabit a place within the text, making them seem to be homodiegetic, yet they are not a character and perform no action, making them seem heterodiegetic. ",

        "text": "Though I consider myself an avid reader and am hoping to write for a living, I'm new to the field of academic criticism. My background is in film and television, two fields which tend to place import on very different metrics of appreciation. I'm used to thinking that a script (or, by extension, book) is valuable because of the skill exhibited in its execution. The message of a film is almost always secondary to the presentation of this message. However, members of this subreddit tend to take the opposite approach.\n\nAs an example: Robert Towne's Chinatown is regularly considered to be one of the best screenplays ever written, because of its emotionally compelling characters, brilliantly constructed plot, and inventive yet naturalistic dialogue. That Chinatown provides a \"creation myth\" for Los Angeles, or that it examines the lingering role of medieval attitudes toward gender, is usually seen as less important than its formalistic quality. Chinatown would be just as well-regarded by screenwriters if these symbolic messages were absent.\n\nDiscussion on this subreddit suggest that most scholars primarily judge works of literature by the \"depth\" of their subtext and their influence upon other works, rather than their formalistic quality. I love Ulysses because of its laborious prose and storytelling, especially its wildly original type of abstract steam of consciousness. However, posters here have suggested that Ulysses is most important because it provides some critique on British imperialism in Ireland. This shocked me. Similarly, I've seen people dismiss the hugely complex works of David Foster Wallace and George R. R. Martin simply because the implicit messages are not original, with essentially no consideration paid to their formalistic excellence. \n\nI don't believe that DFW or GRRM should put on the same pedestal as Joyce, because the composition of their narratives tends to be less graceful and sometimes inefficient. But both of those writers exhibited extreme skill in their novels. Wallace's ability to weave so many influences and topics into his story, in a way that enriches rather than distracts, is incredible and not unlike Joyce's writing in Ulysses. Martin's plots are the best I have read, because of his ability to examine the long-term effects of actions, as felt by people throughout one of the most fully-developed societies in any fiction. \n\nPerhaps even stranger was that I've seen people argue that both those contemporary writers can't truly be comprehended until we know to what degree they affect the work of future artists. I find this perplexing, because shouldn't a work be judged upon its own merit rather than its reception? Would Chaucer really be any less valuable if English writers had somehow returned to Latin and rejected his influence?\n\nThose are my admittedly ignorant observations about the field of literary studies. Have literary scholars always focused more on message than formalism when assessing quality and importance, or is this recent? Is it a postmodern innovation?",

Then there are questions about school work, which, though many people here would be happy to help with, simply do not contain enough material for productive answers.\n\nI can think of a few things which would improve practically every submission:\n\n- What academic level (high school/undergrad/etc.) does the question/prompt come from?\n\n- What is the context of any quotations/sentiments? For example, in questions about theoretical positions, provide either the primary sources (\"Barthes, *Mythologies*\") you are asking about, or the secondary sources summarising those positions (\"Wikipedia page for XYZ\").\n\n- What have you already found about the topic? Which sources have you consulted?\n\n- For questions of interpretation: What do you think? How do you read the passage? Can you spell out exactly what difficulties you are having? This is especially important for things like essay prompts, which people might be willing to help with, but no one is interested in doing the thinking for you. Even for things which are not essay prompts, there's at least one question on the front page right now to which the only real answer is, \"Have you tried reading the text you're asking about?\" Always try answering the question you are asking, to whatever extent possible.",

I'm kind of struggling to put one together. \n\nChandler is the big one I have so far; he's increasingly well-established and the medieval/knightly connection really helps (really, if there were other medieval-y writers in this area, that would be super helpful). \n\nGraham Greene's and Faulkner's respective crime novels might be included, but I'm not sure there's many detectives there, and I'm not sure where to go beyond them. \n\nEDIT: Just want to thank everyone for the suggestions/aid. Y'all have been very generous with your time/assistance, and I've got a pretty solid list now. Those that didn't make it are definitely going on my personal to-read!",

Why do adherents of literature as art scoff at the average bestseller? Now, I'm no liberal revolutionary when it comes to this subject. There are many excellent reasons for drawing lines of differentiation between the likes of Joyce and the RL James (Or whatever the 50 shades writer's name is). \n\nHowever, getting to ASOIAF:\n\nI've read all of the books twice, and still there are details that go completely over my head (I'm a literature student myself, whatever credibility that fact in and of itself might lend me). The prose is admittedly not the series's strong point, but isn't prose ultimately the mere trappings of a story? \n\nThe scope of the narrative and the amount of details that have been smushed into the work is often staggering. \n\nBeing an aspiring writer myself, (I am a far, far better critic than a writer, no delusions of grandeur here) I would consider it nearly as daunting to try and emulate Martin's asoiaf as I would Joyce's Ulysses. For wildly different reasons, of course, but still. Although Martin's prose is almost laughably riddled with cliche he has a fine eye for pacing and story structure. \n\nWell, I'm short on time so I won't be able to flesh out my argument any more. If the subject turns out to be interesting I'm sure many of you will be able to offset that with reflections of your own. \n\nI'll be interested to know what you think. \n\n\n\n",

I already have some novels picked, e.g. Kiss of the Fur Queen (Tomson Highway), When fox is thousand (Larissa Lai), In another place, not here (Dionne Brand), Fall on your knees (Ann-Marie MacDonald), The geography of Pluto (Christopher DiRaddo). Also, I've been recommended authors such as: Farzana Doctor, Shyam Selvaduray and Wyson Choy. With no specific titles, though.\n\nWhat I'd need are novels written from an immigrant perspective but connected to Canada. I'd love some European immigrant novels, for sure. Also, I have a Chinese perspective but I would love to have a Japanese one too! \n\nIf any of you could recommend/suggest me any novel I'd be forever grateful! Thank you so much in advance.",

(Basically, Barthes is about the reader and phenomenology is about the author). Have I got this right? Thank you :)",
