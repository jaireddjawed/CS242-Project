Fairly prematurely in my opinion, but to each their own.\n\n* Now he goes through his Steam discussion board responding to all Bug and Feature requests with \"NO.\" \"If there was a big outcry during Early Access I would have fixed it.\"  \"This isn't a problem\" or my favorite \"I don't have the time or resources to fix that.\" (*Yet while leaving their Steam Profile on* **Public** *and showing precisely how much time they actually DO have and just choose to devote to Timesink-style games rather. How you spend your time is totally your choice, but then don't turn around and blame your customer-base for it being their problem when you clearly have the time to fix the problem yourself and just choose not to. That's my opinion personally.*)\n\n* Example: You can't rebind a decent portion of the keys. Some you can. But major ones like TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT, and FIRE are stuck as what he chose. Wtf? I mentioned it and he accused me of wanting to use \"WEIRD\" controls and maybe to try using \"Normal People Controls\" or be SOL. Wtf??\n\n--------------------\n\n* How do I get through to him? \n\n* How do I really properly convince him that the Open-Mindedness he claims to have exhibited during his Early-Access period shouldn't have just closed up now that his game is \"released?\"\n\n* How do I convince him that **FULLY-REBINDABLE** keys are a historical staple of PC-Gaming and should not be sacrificed or compromised on?\n\n* I've provided so many links of accounts to him where he can read about people complaining about Partially-Rebindable keys, as well as links regarding Early-Access developers fixing problems right off the bat with positive open mindsets, willing to improve their skillset and maybe sacrifice a weekend to improve their game and their own development skills in the process. I've shown him links of devs who give into fear and insecurity and just say *\"there are not enough resources in the world to fix that\"* or turn it around on the customer as THEIR problem and not the developers problem.\n\n* I don't even care about the actual issue with his game anymore, I already fixed it for myself in less than an hour using AutoHotKey. It was NBD. But the principle still stands. I shouldn't have to pull out Notepad and AutoHotKey just to supplement a non-functioning or partially-functioning options/settings menu.\n\n---------------------------\n\nPlease, I'm running out of ideas and I really would love to get through to him. Is there hope? Or is this little developer-ling doomed to closed-mindedness, fear, and insecurity ***forever***??!?!?!\n\nHelp!!!",

        "text": "*Spoilers for New Vegas and Life is Strange coming up!*\n\nSo I've been replaying New Vegas recently and I've been leaning heavily into the speech and barter skills. I've found that, due to the game's relatively poor combat, managing to make my way out of a situation with no weapons being drawn and no blood being spilled can be much more satisfying. However, despite the speech path in many scenarios being 'about' debate, I don't feel that it, or any other speech check-style systems before/after it, have really managed to make a 'game' out of the act of debate. The primary reason for this is because, due to the game's statistical nature, one cannot pick a 'wrong' option when it comes to the speech and barter skills. This is no more exemplified by NV's final boss, Legate Lanius. Upon reaching him you can either fight him or talk him into a surrender and that's one of the many reasons why I love the game. The issue here is, if you have 100 speech, you've won. That, to me, is not a debate as the player does not have to think about what to say; you're given a clearly signposted 'right' answer that will solve the situation. The game tells you how awesome you are with words when you didn't actually *say* anything, you merely passed a skill check because you decided to level up Speech. \n\nNow that's not really a major problem to me; New Vegas isn't about its speech skill and the skill itself is but a single option to enhance the overall role-playing experience. However, there are a few examples of games built around dialogue that, to me, fail in the same area and I find that much less forgiveable. There are two types of these games: Telltale-style 'narrative' games such as The Walking Dead and Life is Strange, and 'courtroom'-style game franchise such as Danganronpa and Ace Attorney. \n\nThe first type tends towards making conversation into a simple \"what do I want this person to think of me\" situation. They do sometimes create scenarios where a careful choice of words is needed (Batman Season 2 is great for this) but, generally, the player will be able to achieve their objectives either because the game simply needs to progress or because the player remembered key information or made the right choices earlier in the story. Take the climactic 'save Kate' scene in episode 2 of Life is Strange. The scene starts out strong with the player character having to pick between equally valid options that differ greatly in how genuinely sympathetic they are to the character in question. However, it soon devolves into a memory test as you're asked to remember which family members care for her and/or what bible verse she wrote down in a notebook. It *is* a debate, but those final few choices, like New Vegas, make said debate into a very 'gamey' skill check. \n\nThat concern for making debate into a simple \"correct/wrong\" test of memory and deduction is my primary concern with the second type I mentioned above. I haven't played Danganronpa but I have played the Ace Attorney games and, whilst I love the series, it is *definitely* more of a puzzle game than a debate game. You're picking holes in someone's arguments but you're doing so based on highly strict deductions and there is no room for the linguistic and acting skills necessary in many debates out there. There is also no grey area between the two sides, no room for compromise, you know the defendant isn't guilty, you just have to prove it to the prosecutor. \n\nSo would it be possible to create a game centred entirely around verbal debates which doesn't fall into the two types I described above? I'm personally not too sure as debate, by its nature, is very subjective and true subjectivity generally isn't gaming's strong suit. However, that's not to say it's impossible, *The Talos Principle*, for features occasional debates with a character that genuinely felt like a true debate. Whilst the game does like to tell you you're wrong, you're being judged not on some arbitrary information you remembered from earlier, but on your personal values and judgements towards a subject. Yet, those debates aren't the game's focus, and they don't have any form of win or failure states. They're a side-show to the game's numerous puzzles. Personally, I think that if a game is to be based around debate it needs to stop thinking about debates as a challenge to objectively be overcome but as a spontaneous attack on the 'opponents' values and beliefs and defence of the player's chosen/given values and beliefs as well. What do you think? \n",

This phenomena has been given as reasoning behind the critical success of multiple titles recently including, but not limited to, the Souls franchise, Breath of the Wild and, most recently, the aforementioned Super Mario Odyssey. The basic idea is that, because of some inherent bias, these games have had their flaws overlooked and that, if looked at in a vacuum, they would have received less favourable reviews. \n\nWhilst it's clear from looking at my profile that I disagree, I thought I'd make a post asking the sub in general what they think.

        "text": "Some people argue that in Black Desert Online, if they sold straight up overpowered equipment, it would still be a less predatory cash shop than what we currently have.\n\nBlack Desert uses a sandbox system in which every player has their own version of the persistent global world, using a type of currency called contribution points, you are able to invest this CP into various property around the world. CP gets refunded to you if you decide to sell your property, hence it's treated as a rental.\n\nCP is soft capped: while technically there is no limit to the amount of CP, acquiring more after 255 CP becomes hard, after 350 it becomes a monumental task, and after 400 CP it becomes a korean task.\n\nThe cash shop in BDO is the target of constant arguments and discussions about pay to win. The cash shop includes the usual cosmetics and bells and whistles, it also includes the typical MMO \"convenience\" items such as inventory space expansion, autolooting pets, etc...\n\nThe problem is that the shop in BDO has taken the concept of \"pay for convenience\" to a whole new heinous level, to the point that the practices are so predatory and money grubbing that the players are starting to debate whether having straight up pay to win items would be better than the stuff they have right now.\n\nIt is a prime example of a game that artificially creates inconveniences only to sell you the solution for a price. And a one time payment is not enough, they want you to be constantly shelling out large sums of money to be able to keep the inconveniences at bay.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* as CP is capped, you need storage space in your main cities. You start with 8 slots, absolutely not enough for anythinf, and you can invest CP into buying houses for storage. You could also instead pay $40 to get 184 more storage slots out of the ether and instead of investing the cp into storage, you get yourself a tool workshop or a refinery\n\n* in the higher level areas, you might find an NPC that is a blacksmith. Every blacksmith in every city has a shop in which you can buy and sell stuff. This blacksmith in particular is right next to a popular grinding spot, but he has no shop. You could run back to town and miss out on grinding time to buy potions, or you could spend some time to make a campsite using ingame crafting and production, which would allow you to set up a camp that has a shop in it, as well as an anvil to repair. Potions from the shop cost more, repair fees are double, and in order to craft the whole campsite you need to grind for a huge variety of materials ranging from timber to metal to plants, etc... Oh and not only that, the campsite components have durability, and cannot be repaired. OR you could pay $100 to get a full campsite with shops with prices below normal NPC prices, half repair costs and NO DURABILITY ON THE COMPONENTS, why how convenient. \n\nThe whole game seems to be designed around avoiding the technical definition of pay to win, and thus a debate has sparked in the community on this topic. While some people abide by the purest definition of pay to win, that is, selling unobtainable gear that have stats strictly superior to the best items obtainable via regular gameplay; some others abide by the concept that if you were to compare a paying and a non paying player with similar playtime, if their gear or overall progression show a considerable difference, then the game is pay to win.\n\nHowever, a new argument has surfaced claiming that the game does not need to be strictly pay to win to have an unacceptable monetization model, arguing that if BDO were to sell gear unobtainable with superior stats for a flat fee, permanent, it would be a better model than the current pay to solve inconveniences forever shop.\n\nI have the following questions:\n\n* does pay to win include the definition that if you were to compare 2 players who have similar thousands of hours of playtime and find a significant difference in overall progressio, no matter how possible it is for the non paying player to reach the same situation as the paying player, it would be considered pay to win?\n\n* Is pay to win the only type of unacceptable monetization model, or are other types of monetization models also unacceptable, and if so, to what extent? Would you go as far as including predatory cosmetic monetization into the unacceptable category, even if they do not strictly affect gameplay in any way?",

My girlfriend recently showed interest in gaming and says she wants me to help her start. Now I play a lot of online shooters \"deeper\" games like counter-strike, DOTA, tf2, Civ series etc. These are games that I believe would be nigh impossible for a new comer to the hobby to attempt. \n\nI tested her with Portal, a game that i believe was so well put together that even someone who had no concept of video games, no context as to gaming \"standards\" would have had an easy time getting into due to it's excellent learning curve and invisible tutorial, but it seemed to me she couldn't grasp simple pattern recognition that would allow her to learn how to play, she got about an hour in and was managing to get through puzzle by essentially fluking, even though in my mind it should've been simple to think \"I went through the portal fast and came out fast before, I should apply that principle now.\"\n\nNow she is by no means dumb, in fact she's incredibly smart, but for some reason all those brains fly out the window when playing a game, simple pattern recognition and application vanishes. \n\nSo thought about it, and chalked it up to her lacking the context that I, and other gamer's have. Over years doing the same hobby people develop an understanding of the \"standards\" to expect with various games, games might vary wildly but thing like: elements of the UI, victory conditions, mechanics, controls, etc. remain the same. Due to my background gaming I cannot imagine not being able to intuitively make connections immediately within a game.\n\nNow I was introduced to gaming with the original 2d mario games, then 3d platformers, basic shooters, rpg's. So my context and built in knowledge of decades of gaming allows me to intuitively grasps concepts without need for much thought. Without having to take my girlfriend through a history of gaming over years and years, what are some games that can introduce her to the hobby and also instill in her an understanding, basic or comprehensive, of general concepts within video games.\n\nthanks for the help \n\nEdit: lotta the comments pointed out that it sounds like I'm insulting my girlfriend, i realize that some parts of the post do, thanks for pointing that out. I love my girlfriend very much and am not attempting to insult her, she is very much a strong and capable woman.",

        "text": "Hey.\n\nI'm 30 and this idea popped out as i was being rekt in PUBG. This topic however could still be applied to many other games.\n\nThe thing is the game thinks that im top 5% in duo-s and last night we were being constantly put up with god like players. usually I'd think cheaters, but when we checked their ratings they were all like 2-0.5%.\nWe are not good shots at all, we just use brains to position correctly and not die to the zone, and we avoid the lottery of the hot drop zones, because fuck waiting in queue waiting the plain, waiting to fall down to die because there was no gun in my room.\n\nSo the function of the MMR is supposed to be matching you in games where it is a 50-50 (in a team based game) to get a win, so it is always competitive.\n\nMy question is then, what is the point of getting better? If every time you get better, you will just be put up with harder guys, you will always no matter what (in an ideal system) be put up against players where you have a 50% chance to win.\n\nThe way i see unless you are literally the best 0.01%, there is no point for you to get any better, because no matter how good you get, you wont feel it because you will be challanged the same way no matter your skill.\nYou cant apply these skills anywhere outside of the games, so there is no benefit for getting better, unless you want to dick wave and show off your rank to friends.\n\nThere is an arguement that close games are the best, but to be honest that is not true. It is not true because those are very stressful, and not every game that has close games are fun. For me LoL was fun when it was a close game (rare occurance) but in CS it isnt rly fun. Neither in pubg, as there is no such a thing as a close game there. It is also fun in HS, but at least that has an end to the ladder that is achievable.\n\nBUT people smurf, and they do it, because it is a lot more fun to win. And why would you not want to experience how good you are, if you have already put 300+ hours into a game and you are in the top 25% of players (which isnt even like an elite place to be)\n\nI think this is the reason why so many people are smurfing( i havent yet). You get to actually experience how good you are if you are playing with people not as good as you are. Let me explain.\n\nLet's say you are top 25% in a game. You never get to experience it, you are just told that is the case, but what your experience shows you is, no matter what, you always have a tough match, and if you are slightly underperforming u'll get smacked.\n\nIf there was a way, or mode, where people were just put up randomly, you would actually have a chance to gauge how good you are compared to others and how far you have to go when faced with better players. I personally think this might be a better way to improve and learn than to be put into a 50-50 all the time.\nYou would have a real sense of where you are, and i think a PUBG like game is the best place to implement such a thing, because of how many players are in one single game.\n\nI mean it was like this in the old days, where MMR wasnt really a thing. You just hop on the server finder, or if the game had one then you looked for your fav servers and went in. Pwnd the noobs, got your ass handed to you by the better players and you learned.\n\nI still remember whilst playing a mod for Q3 (excessive +) where i managed to win a duel match against the highest rated player(by the community), and it is still with me 14 years later. That is memorable. \nBeing put up into the never ending grind of the ladder just makes it futile to compete, if all you care about is a good experience.\nOr are we so SJW-y that we want even the worst fucking players to feel as if they are good and have a real chance every game? (it is okay to make them feel it sometimes, but every game?)\nHave we forgotten how learning actually works? \nWould we prefer pulling a blanket of ignorance over every young gamer's eyes and make them feel special and do the opposite of preparing them for real life?\nI dont see losing and learning a bad thing, but i see never experiencing how good/bad you are something unjust that is taken from you nowadys.\n\nI'd like to hear your opinions with arguements about this. i cant be the only one feeling this way.\n\nTL;DR Matchmaking always puts you in 50-50 you never get to see how good/bad you really are. Is there even a point?\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm going to preface this by saying that the game is decent and I hope a sequel arrives that addresses these criticisms and services hardcore gamers.\n\n- - - - -\n--------\n\nThis game is easily one of if not the most sub par video game in the Super Mario series, presenting some of the easiest challenges the franchise has ever seen. The difficulty ramps up tremendously for the last level, being overtly hard before sloping back to way too easy again.\n\nThe brand new mechanic of possessing enemies is heavily underutilized, amounting to little more than a side addition. The levels are obscenely huge with lots of open space and very few platforming elements, running in stark contrast to Super Mario's roots.\n\nThere's a hyper realistic level that appears out of nowhere only containing a few collectibles and is over soon after it is begun. The most iconic level from the series the mushroom kingdom, is only available after beating the game, and has ludicrously basic challenge.\n\nHalf of the game's collectibles aren't obtainable until after you've beaten the game. Most of the collectibles can just be picked up upon their discovery, so having half of them gated until after the final boss is ridiculous.\n\nThe game earns a good deal of praise for its movement system, which it just doesn't put to good use nearly often enough. The game is laden with absurd quantities of the main macguffin and even has them in shops for purchase in sets of ten.\n\nOne of your useful abilities can only be executed by way of motion controls, this means players can't do it when their console is in handheld mode. Neither can you remap your move set to other buttons.\n\n- - - - -\n--------\n\nThis title seems like a hodgepodge of visual elements and experimental game play strewn together with no clear focus. Levels alternate between attention to minute detail and a lack thereof, there's no cohesion between the varying art styles that're implored.\n\nThis game banks on players' attachment to the characters, and is largely aimed at casual gamers and a younger audience. It serves as a brilliant introduction to video games but it doesn't service hardcore gamers in the slightest. Seasoned veterans that are praising this game are doing so merely through rose tinted nostalgia lenses.\n\nIt lacks staying power with a hardcore crowd and serves as a massive time sink for those willing to engage it openly. Replaying the game is an antithetical endeavor due to overall length of the content offerings, and completing everything is frankly a matter of patience instead of skill.\n\nWhat surprises me quite a bit is that Yooka-Laylee did as poorly as it did, when Super Mario Odyssey was praised by critics. They're very similar video games, only the former cannot quite capitalize on established characters.\n\nOverall its success can seemingly be attributed to brand recognition and sparing releases, as well as modulating game play cycles affording itself well to bite sized play sessions. It doesn't offer anything novel in terms of its platforming adventure genre, and is essentially a bloated appeal to fans and players new to games in general.",

        "text": "So I recently completed this game and it was a pretty alright ride. Not many times do you get a platformer that focuses on gameplay and story (Apparently Ori is this but I haven't played it). \n\nThat being said, the final chapter was a complete utter chore and wasn't satisfying at all. I'm speaking of Chapter 7 not 8 of course (I'm not going to bother with the core). The reason for this is because the game had already peaked with the fight against Mirror Madeline (I guess that's what she's called?). I was for sure certain the game was over after that fight. The music, the amount of friggin screens you go through, the build up leading to that fight, nothing afterwards could possibly compare. And I was right, nothing even came close. \n\nBut instead of ending the game shortly after, you go through another full level that essentially over indulges in the power of accepting yourself. You don't even get a boss fight in this chapter. All I can think about is how much more satisfying the game would've been if it ended earlier. It kinda reminds me of Persona 4 and it's extremely stupid extra part of the ending (though nowhere near as bad).\n\nAs for the story and characters, it's alright but nothings really well expanded upon. You never get much insight into Madelines background other than she has some vague sense of depression. Would've been more interesting if we could get some idea on what possibly led her there. Her mirror self is basically a Persona 4 Shadow. Rather heavy handed in it's approach and most of her dialogue is fairly sub-par and repetitive. Theo's alright and the dialogue between her and Madeline is the best part of the game, very natural overall. It's paced pretty well other than what I complained about, just it never really delves too deep into anything either. \n\nThough the biggest problem I've learned with a platformer having a story, is I have no motivation to complete any of the challenges once I'm done with the story.

        "text": "A lot of games in the past decade or so have relied on a detective mode or press R3 to ping style method to highlight important objects in the world.  The game designers understandably want to keep you immersed in the world, so they don't want the added \"gameplay relevant\" UI elements present at all times.  As a result, in Batman Arkham games, and the new Tomb Raiders, and Witcher 3, or Horizon Zero Dawn's focus, and many others, you activate a detective mode thing that essentially clouds out the normal presentation of the game in order to give you a more \"gameplay relevant\" presentation of the game in order to highlight important stuff for the player, whether it be plants to pick up, or enemies, or an arrow pointing you to your next objective.\n\nSome other games, dragon age inquistion for example, used a ping style system, where you click in the right stick, and a pulse emits out that temporarily highlights important stuff, or gives you your objective arrow.\n\nSeveral problems crop up with these systems.  Firstly, even when there's a good \"lore\" explanation, it often takes me out of the immersion of the game.  It makes sense in the lore for batman to be able to enter detective mode, it makes sense that Geralt can focus his mind and see monster tracks, it...kind makes sense that Lara Croft can maybe stay still and focus in other to see important things around her.  What's annoying though is that these systems always alter the presenation of the game to make it less immersive...the screen becomes blurry, or black and white, or it's just a bunch of vectors in detective mode.  You'd never WANT to play the whole game in these modes.\n\nAnother problem is that you're giving the player another toggle or annoying thing that they feel compelled to constantly click or press to make sure they're not missing anything.  It just adds tedium in my mind.\n\nMonster Hunter World, however, uses something called Scoutflies and to me this seems to be the best possible implementation of this idea yet.  They're always active, unless you're in combat, and they automatically fly around to highlight the important things in the environment, and also guide you to your next objective.  You don't have to press any buttons.  You don't have to make the whole game world become black and white, or blurred, or vector graphics.  And they still maintain immersion and are integrated into the lore of the game.\n\nHave scoutflies solved the \"detective mode\" problem?",

Forgotten Realms, Battletech, etc), and players are able to experience all sorts of smaller stories and adventures in that universe.  At the same time, there are many content creators fleshing out that setting, with all sorts of different media. And an overall organisation keeping everything consistent.\n\n\nI've always been a bit disappointed that such a thing never took off in video games. Video games never really achieved \"horizontal diversity\", with many similar games exploring different stories in the same setting. (Only example I can think of are the old \"Gold Box\" D&amp;D games.). In most cases, video games have \"linear diversity\", ie. sequels, but the subsequent games vary so much in technology and game mechanics that you can't get that feeling of \"many adventures in the same universe\".\n\n\nIf we're talking AAA games, then yes technology moves on and its hard to reuse assets from previous games.  But there are many low-fi RPGs, from the RPG Maker games to stuff like Avernum, mobile games, handheld JRPGs, etc.  I'm saddened that no such franchise has ever taken off.\n\n\nLets discuss why this is?  Is it a market driven thing? Do video game players have different expectations, and they would be bored with playing many RPGs with identical mechanics (you could even transfer your characters over?), a mix of old and new locations, but just new story? \n\n\nOr is it a developer thing? I would have assumed such a franchise would be cheaper to develop due to shared assets and possibly crowdsourced writing, but maybe there are other factors that make it difficult?",

        "text": "In the interest of not turning this into a promotion post and violating the rules, I'll keep it general, but this discussion pertains to an element of an in-development video game .\n\nIn many city-builders and management games, the total amount of money in the system at any given time pretty much just increases - money appears from nowhere as buildings that produce some resource generate income from thin air.  This generally allows the player to build up a critical mass of funds that can be used to purchase high-level upgrades or buildings that have comparatively large gameplay effects or are rewarding in some other way, but what about games where when money is spent, it gets tracked and spent again later by the game itself?  There are several interesting scenarios which could represent this, but I'll focus on just one here:\n\nIn a city builder, the total amount of money the population has to spend on goods and services you produce is tied directly to the wages you, the manager, pay.  Now, expand the concept to a multiplayer competitive setting: multiple managers trying to turn a profit and grow their cities, all vying for the money of  a shared public.  This means that wages you pay will eventually end up in the pockets of your competitors or vice versa, so you are encouraged to strike a good balance between the cost of your goods (lower is more attractive and encourages the population to spend money on you, but also reduces your profits) and the wages paid (higher makes people happier, but also cuts into profits).  Are there any standout examples of games which utilize this dynamic?",

Whereas most of popular successful games focus on 3 or 4 mechanics (combat, crafting, resources management...) at most, these games just bombard you with never ending new mechanics (Persona5 is ridiculous with these, 30 hours into the game you are still receiving tutorials messages because they introduce new systems....).\n\nIn the end, when you get down to it, they really are shallow simple systems. These game mechanics appear and seem overwhelming because they are presented \"in game and within the game story context\", but taken by themselves they really are just basic core stuff (dungeons to grind, crafting=cooking, simple relationship AI, etc).\n\nNevertheless, these games twist all this in a manner that they make you think either :  \n- wow this is deep  \n- wow, this is too much, i give up (looking at you persona 5)  \n\n-------------\n\nAs an example, I am on the verge of giving up Persona 5 because they introduced the \"new type of dungeons that are not main dungeon but you need to do it and it means this and that....\" - ugh. Please. I was already a bit skeptical when they tell you about the fusion system for your Persona (I actually dont use it, thus I believe it's completly optional?).\n\nSame thing with Yakuza 0, at one point you are introduced to a game system where, through the store of a NPC, you can send AI on the hunt for materials in order to craft stuff... the game is already full of game mechanics (food, mini quests, relationship, combat * 3, XP, ....), this is too much and it isnt clear if i NEED to do it or it is just optional?\n\n-------------\n\n**So the big question** :   \n- What do you guys think of this method of having LOTS of simple but (sometimes) interconnected mechanics ?   \n- Is it a fake way to show deepness in a design ?  \n- Is it a very Japanese thing?  \n- if these games remove most of their optional/peripheral mechanics and just keep core 4 or 5 systems, do they stay good?   \n- is it a potentially efficient design method : create many simple game systems, make them interconnected, and hope that it produces a deep overall system?  \n- does this system mainly attract people who are completionist and strongly involved with the game (I dont think you can \"casually\" play these games... they ask too much from you)\n  \n\nthank you\n",

        "text": "That is, how do you handle players being able to communicate. In situations where the game would not allow for it?  \nThis is a very niche thing. Probably for good reasons when it comes to mass market appeal.  \nBut some games do implement limitations on any kind of communication. Here are a few examples.  \n\nIntruder has local voice by default. Long range communication is only possible via radio. The catch is that anyone can hear you speak. Asking your teammates anything can be risky since it's very much about sneaking around. It has hand signs to allow for silent communications. It really goes all in on this uncertainty. There is no kill feed. Falling down doesn't mean you are dead. Being shot can simply ragdoll you. Hearing shots and asking on the radio \"Are you still alive?\" with no answer. \n\nSpace Station 13 also has local communications by default. Any long range communication can be tampered with. Hearing an explosion and not being able to get in contact with anyone on the station. Makes for a very nervous situation.  \n\nSquad is milder and they have written about this very issue in their dev blog as well. By default you can speak locally or with your squad. Only squad leaders can ask other squad leaders directly via voice. This means that the grunts have to trust that their squad leader is telling the truth about the other squads' plans. Enemies can't hear you speak however. Mainly for a fear of everyone moving to other voice services.  \n\nIn all these examples. Being able to speak with anyone. Even those you *shouldn't* be able to speak to. Breaks the design in some way. Knowing your buddy died in Intruder. Knowing that the engine has been blown up and that the perpetrator was last seen in a particular maintenence shaft. Or just knowing the real exact plans of the entire team.  \n\nSo how do you deal with this problem? Is it even a problem at all? Personally I adore these limitations and hate to step outside of the uncertainty and immersion it brings to a game. Still I know that playing to win is a big thing for many others. Getting the upper hand in literally any situation is the best thing to happen. Letting the enemy hear you speak before breaching a door is not ideal.  ",

With the right mechanics, questions like that could become a part of the experience.\n\nThe thought came to me when watching the Bokoblin in *Breath of the Wild* running away in fear from lit bombs. I'd love to hear more examples and ideas for how enemy AI with self-preservation instincts can be implemented.",

        "text": "These thoughts have been rattling around in my head for a little while, and I'm not sure where else to put them, so forgive me if this is a bit all over the place.\n\nThis idea is largely inspired by conversations around things like designers intent and the degree to which developers can or should be considerate of their audiences own desires or demands for options in games relating to gameplay. For example, Mark Browns video on gameplay options and Celeste's assist mode:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NInNVEHj_G4\n\nOne thing that occurs to me throughout this discussion is the difference in videogames between other kinds of play - tag, board games, card games, etc. which is that videogames act as their own enforcement mechanism for gameplay rules.\n\nIn those other kinds, while cards, boards, and other props might be made with a particular design in mind, the rules are largely still abstract, and the items themselves can be changed or ignored. One of the most common things for example is to modify the rules of Monopoly. Many people do things like have money paid from Chance cards and the like to the free parking spot, for the next time someone lands they then receive the money.\n\nVideogames however are software, and software is executed by the computer. Thus, gameplay rules as executed are effectively externally enforced in very different and more significant way than the rules of most other kinds of games.\n\nThese rules are enforced by even further means - source code to games is often withheld, so more significant changes often require some element of reverse engineering. This is partly the basis of modding - figuring out how a game does something, then working out how to modify it to do what you want.\n\nAnother step is moving the enforcement mechanism away from the persons own computer, to a remote server. This happens in online games, and doesn't just happen for the sake of multiplayer games, but also for things like DRM, or micro-transactions.\n\nWith is in mind, If a game released and played \"as intended\" is effectively a communicated statement, modding turns a game into a conversation between player and designers and writers. A designer might say x, but players can respond with y. Maybe your game would fit your vision better with these rules, or maybe this idea doesn't work, or maybe this can be tweaked. Modding turns the designer from some Moses figure on high, delivering the word of God (the designer) to something that is much more a back and forth between people on equal terms.\n\nIn other kinds of media, we don't just have written criticism. Someone who thinks a film is not edited well might not just say so, but edit and show that scene to help make the point (and this is even partly legally protected through fair use). There is certainly nothing wrong with listening to and enjoying a game in an \"intended\" way, but there should be no controversy in people being able to respond as such.\n\nAt ~6:20, the video notes:\n\n&gt;I don't want players to feel like they're being asked to design how the game should work\n\nBut this is placing impetus on the developer needing to accommodate their audiences own beliefs or criticisms, or that the audience isn't already forming their own ideas of how the game should or might work, which I think is an incorrect way of framing the discussion. I think this is supported further by the example of SOMA in the video, where the developers state they felt more comfortable releasing the mode later as a means of making their \"statement\" clear, while forgetting that players had already responded with the wuss mode mod.\n\nIn other words, the framing of discussion around \"intended\" play is framed incorrectly as an impetus on designers to accommodate their audiences differences or criticisms that infringes upon or impacts their statement. I do think for things like accessibility (which might sometimes include assist or easy modes) there are strong reasons for this responsibility to fall on a developer. Really though, modding is the way out of this, and perhaps the bigger problem is that games enforce themselves through being played, with mechanisms sometimes designed to undermine the ability for a player to effectively respond.",

        "text": "The release of Assassin's Creed: Origins' Discovery Tour mode yesterday has got me thinking about how this generation has given birth to a gameplay style I have never seen before - one where players are encouraged to slow down, absorb the atmosphere and take photos of the beautiful digital landscapes. It's a shock to see this in a AAA Ubisoft game like Assassin's Creed, as it's a far cry from the usual fast-paced, combat-heavy gameplay which the mainstream favours. I suspect this has come about because graphics this generation have moved past the basic photorealism of last generation and have become capable of showing the true beauty of landscapes with advances in lighting and shading techniques.\n\nThe most obvious example of this is the growing amount of games featuring a photo mode. I love this because it encourages an appreciation of the landscape and the beauty which is either carefully crafted by the developers  (e.g. The Last of Us) or created organically through excellent procedural generation and graphical capabilities (e.g. No Man's Sky). With a tool that allows them to capture powerful moments and share them with friends and with the internet, players are encouraged to seek out these moments of quiet beauty and, as the public photo map markers of AC:Origins prove, many people are eager to do it.\n\nMore importantly, gameplay itself allows for this in a lot of modern games - this is a drastic change from gaming's persistent and eternal love for fast-paced combat. No Man's Sky is a game where the gameplay loop consists of wandering and discovering awe-inspiring sights or simply resting in an alien landscape and taking in the atmosphere, before moving on to find a new place to appreciate, repeating the process over. More recently, Assassin's Creed's Discovery Tour shows that Ubisoft has realised the power of allowing players to safely and calmly explore one of their carefully crafted open worlds without having to worry about \"typical\" game elements ruining the moment, like being approached by an enemy or accidentally triggering a quest.\n\nEven older games are being reworked to account for this new style of gameplay. The Last of Us: Remastered did this to an extent with a photo mode allowing you to pause the combat and soak in the post-apocalyptic world, but I think the inclusion of a photo mode in the new Shadow of the Colossus is far more significant. The world of SotC was always beautiful, but the original encouraged you to whiz through it on the way to the next epic set-piece. Only the players willing to stop and explore the vast landscape would be the ones to discover its many hidden beauties. But with the simple addition of a photo mode, players are now encouraged to stop and take in the heavy-laden atmosphere of the forbidden land, allowing the rocks and ruins to tell their melancholy tale with a much louder voice than the PS2 original ever allowed.\n\nAs someone who no longer wants to spend my free time grinding away at hard games (or multiplayer deathmatch games) before I'm good enough to play them properly (which requires a lot of concentration and can be tiring or stressful at times), this new genre of beautiful, calm contemplative games is warmly welcomed by me. It's especially interesting to see it in the mainstream.\n\nThis has turned into a bit of an essay. I hope it's interesting to read and I'm interested to hear what you guys think about this. Do you think we'll see more of this in mainstream games, given the apparent success of Discovery Tour? Do you think we'll see more games dedicated to this style, like No Man's Sky, or do you think it will continue to be an added mode/alternate gameplay style in typical action games?",

        "text": "We are seeing some clashes between organizations interested in the preservation of history and culture, and those for the defense of the video games industry's interests over whether there should be exemptions in the law to allow online games to be modified and servers reverse engineered, so that they can remain playable.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2018/02/20/esa-dmca-online-gaming-petition/\n\nConsidering now online elements are often present and sometimes the games can't be played offline at all, it seems to me very important for their preservation as cultural artifacts. As much as some may trivialize it, online games are just as much part of our culture as movies and books. At least as much as a Doctor Who or a Sherlock Holmes. It is even ironic that the ESA argues that it is not worth being preserved at the same time they ask for strong protections for their alledgely irrelevant work.\n\nThis idea that works of entertainment are not worthy of preservation and especially shouldn't be accessed by the general public does not sit right with me, considering how I spent my youth getting popular contemporary fiction books in libraries with no problems. It only makes me wonder why libraries seemed to freeze in time when now there is technology to make information and culture available in such a wider scale.\n\nBut I'd go beyond that. If we are talking about preservation, the logs of the player interactions, actions and conversations could be of great interest for future game designers, sociologists and historians. This, however, may bring some privacy issues on top of the copyright issues, so I don't know how it could be handled.\n\nUnfortunately, not only the game companies are unwilling to aid the preservation of these games, they are actively fighting against it. Considering the speed our technology advances and old software becomes obsolete, if it were up to them, we could lose vast amounts of the cultural heritage of this medium. In the larger picture, only select few games get remakes and remasters, and it is to be wondered if they would even get those if not by the interest of pirates who keep these works available clandestinely. The great majority does not get adapted or preserved in any form. Considering how long the copyright length is, now more than a century, it makes me wonder if there would even be any useful information left by the time these games were supposed to return to the public domain, were it all to be done properly and legally.\n\nWhat do you think of how videogames are preserved for the future today? Do you think the law today is adequate for both rights protection and preservation of games? What, if anything, should change?",

I must not be the only one that has started to think like this.\n\nThis is one of those areas where we have gone backwards in technology. I used to be able to get into a game by quickly chucking Enter a few times. That's the way to do it.\n\nWhat if game reviews started to shine light on the issue? Each review would state a simple \"startup time\" and \"level loading time\" that happened on the test machine. Just some rough average benchmarks measured with a stopwatch. They might vary from machine to machine, but still would be more than enough to give the big picture. At least I would find that incredibly refreshing.\n\nIt's technologically problematic because modern games *actually have to* load and process gigabytes of data. However, I think that by giving this area more love, the situation could still be improved significantly. What if couple of engineers in the company were thrown a technological challenge to cut down the loading time to half? The motivation could simply be \"it looks great in reviews\". I wonder what would happen?\n\nCurrently loading times seem to be a bitter pill that both developers and gamers swallow without questioning.",

        "text": "So you know the [thread about the lack of diverse worlds in fantasy games](/r/truegaming/comments/7ycp23/why_are_most_fantasy_worlds_so_generic/) right?\n\nI've been finding that it's not just the worlds that are generic but also the fantasy subgenres that fantasy games tend to emulate. Most fantasy games seem to specifically try to emulate [high fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy). Or, if you want to be snarky, \"doorstop map fantasy\".\n\nThis isn't even a triple A thing really. *Pillars of Eternity* and *Divinity: Original Sin* were still high fantasy. *Morrowind* gets brought up a lot in these kinds of threads, and while it's world is strange as far as genre goes it's still *kind* of high fantasy.\n\n(I'm mostly considering Western games here.)\n\nWhat I find especially weird is that other fantasy subgenres could be *more suited* to standard video games than high fantasy. Take [sword and sorcery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery) like Conan for a minute. The \"kill 'em all and take their stuff\" gameplay of most games would fit Conan far more than it ever fit Tolkien.\n\n(That said, *side quests* in fantasy games can often take the format of the sword and sorcery genre.)\n\nCompare to the tabletop gaming world where people have been discussing [D&amp;D's original Appendix N](http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm) and the possibility that Gary Gygax's vision for D&amp;D was more along the lines of pulp fantasy than Tolkien.\n\ntldr Why is only Funcom making Conan games?\n\n# Edit\n\nSo a lot of posts are talking about basically the worldbuilding of a game. e.g. How much magic does it have? I'm trying to talk about the writing and themes of a given game.\n\nSo one genre I contrasted high fantasy with was swords and sorcery. And here's a whole article about that:\n\nhttps://io9.gizmodo.com/whats-the-difference-between-epic-fantasy-and-sword-and-1617687425\n\n&gt; To go into more detail, epic fantasy tends (see? tends!) to involve stories on a grand scale, where armies are involved in battles across sweeping landscapes, where stakes are global and detailed continent or country maps are de rigueur. There may or may not be a dark lord, but there are certainly multiple characters, maybe even hundreds of characters.\n\n&gt; By contrast, sword and sorcery tales tend to confine themselves to one or two characters, concern themselves with low stakes and high action, and confine themselves to the moment. The heroes of sword and sorcery often aren't. The quintessential S&amp;S protagonist is often someone who is morally ambiguous and self-serving.\n\nNote that neither of these descriptions ask how much magic or how many elves there are. They're contrasting the scope of the setting, the number of characters, and the level of the stakes.\n\nAnd I find many fantasy games specifically following the first description than the second.",

        "text": "Metal Gear Survive comes out today and it got me thinking about the game.  I played the beta over the weekend and thought it was pretty fun, but this is definitely not a Metal Gear game.  As such, the chances that this game isn't going to get shit on by both fans and critics is precisely zero.  But I think that was the whole reason behind Konami's decision to make the game.\n\nAfter Kojima's departure from Komami and the bad press the company received afterward, the future of Metal Gear looked grim.  Being such a huge money-maker for Konami it was a sure thing that they were going to continue the franchise, but this time without any involvement from Kojima.  And Kojima's work on these games was so off the rails and brilliant that it was pretty much impossible for Konami to deliver the same kind of experience that fans had come to expect.  So no matter what they did, it was pretty much guaranteed that the first post-Kojima Metal Gear game was going to get a lot of hate.  Konami could have instead started work on Metal Gear Solid 6 and spent millions of dollars on the product in an attempt to make it the best Metal Gear yet, but fans would still most likely boycott it.  \n\nThat's why Metal Gear Survive is so brilliant.  They want to get the hate out of the way as quick and inexpensively as possible so that they can continue on the franchise for real.  I mean, the game seems designed to annoy Metal Gear fans.  It's a survival game with zombies set in another dimension with no series regular characters and no real relevance to the overarching Metal Gear plot.  What is there for fans to love?  Hell, even the $40 price tag implies that it's not a full game. \n Plus the game was made using assets from The Phantom Pain, which keeps cost (and risk) down. And the addition of microtransactions helps to offset the (likely) low-sales of the game.   \n\nMetal Gear Survive also lowers the bar for future games, while simultaneously making fans more excited for them.  If they had gone ahead and made Metal Gear Solid 6, we would all be comparing it to Metal Gear Solid 5.  But now when they get around to making it we'll instead be comparing it to Survive.  Sure we'll also compare it to 5, but most of the buzz around the game will be about Metal Gear's return to form and how much better it is than the last one.  Plus at that point, a lot of fans will likely have gotten over their Konami boycott (having gotten to hate on Survive) and just be excited to play another Metal Gear Solid game.  \n\nAll in all, Survive seems destined to fail, and I think that was the point.",

        "text": "Here is a video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICVHMOjKncU\n\nBeing a long-time Tom Clancy fan, you often expect a lot of story-driven narratives where some elements have their own sci-fi elements like Splinter Cell's near-future technology, combined with some real-life elements like for example The Division *(though technically a Tom Clancy game in terms of gameplay, mechanics or even story since it is not based off of a Tom Clancy novel and it has the Tom Clancy name)* is mostly based off of Operation Dark Winter, a mock simulation where the U.S. Government tested on how to be prepared in case an actual biological pandemic happened in the U.S.\n\nMost stories in the Tom Clancy series have some form of realism in it which is a part of its charm with the usual heroes-vs-villains type of story with a more mature or dark look and sometimes even a level of conspiracy involved like hunting down an underground criminal organisation, or stopping a worldwide terrorist attack or even stopping a conspiracy that could result in nuclear war or World War 3.\n\n*(and sometimes, there were often some shades of grey in terms of morality as some vilians had their own sympathetic motivations although they were also extreme too)*\n\nHowever, most of the enemies that the protagonists face were external threats like ultra-nationalist Russians or worldwide criminal organisations and so on.\n\nRainbow Six Patriots was promised to have a different look. The main antagonists, the True Patriots, although their motivations involved extremism, intimidation, terrorism and other illegal acts, they were domestic terrorists whose motivations were sympathetic because they felt that the U.S. was too corrupt and needed to be destroyed entirely.\n\nIt was a more politically-driven type of story with more politically complicated elements because the topic regarding U.S. politics and possible corruption and other shady practices was a very hot topic during that time and it still is today.\n\nEven though I would not have liked the idea of neglecting the tactics and strategy focused elements that Tom Clancy games are known for, this idea of a complex story with different perspectives whose neither good or bad was a brilliant idea.\n\nYes, of course people are going to take this too literally and will be personally affected by this \n\n*(I mean, come on. Have you seen how politics often meddles with video games and scapegoat them for pretty much anything?)*\n\nYes, some far-right people would have probably taken the game too literally and think it was a propaganda to motivate people to become domestic terrorists. Yes, some legal action would have probably been involved *(as if domestic terrorism was somehow a new thing because many TV shows and films used this kind of story as a plot element)*\n\nBut man, this would have been a bold move for Ubisoft to publish this kind of story and probably spark endless discussions ",

But recently I used Splatoon as a way to introduce the concept of colonialism in relation to spatial mechanics in videogames. The core of this idea resides in understanding that a fundamental aspect of games is space. One way we can understand games (but by no means the only way) is that games are about movement through and/or the manipulation of (perceived) space. If we consider this then isn't it necessary that we look at key concepts such as colonialism within this light? So instead of looking at economic systems of colonialism in strategy games, if we look at the simple act of claiming territory in Splatoon, can we label it as colonialist?\n\nI don't think we can because colonialism is a much more complicated concept than just the claiming of space, but in pursuing this line of questioning we can figure out exactly why and understand colonialism better. Are there other games that contain mechanics of spatial dominance that bear a similarity to colonialism outside of the examples talked about here?\n\nI made a video about it which you can find down below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrbKl_mSec0",

We've been working with Microprocessors and Microcontrollers using C and Assembly language lately and while it's not extremely difficult to pick up if you've had some prior programming experience, it makes my head explode in wonder and disbelief that all the NES, SNES, and Genesis classics we've come to love were written with hardware specific Assembly and C. If you have any experience whatsoever with these two languages, you know how low-level they are and in many cases (especially hardware specific Assembly), the programmer has to write code with a \"1 to 1\" causative ratio. You're literally scraping the metal with Assembly language and almost nothing is abstracted from the programmer: you have direct control over the behavior of the hardware itself using the actual pins from the data direction registers. \n\nSo, somewhere in the midst of my stunned amazement that a living, breathing, actual human could ever achieve something so artistic and creative as say, the first Final Fantasy or Zelda, using hardware specific Assembly almost exclusively, I came across [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Gebelli). He was the programmer of many different games and first garnered his reputation by producing nearly arcade-perfect ports for the Apple II, something not thought possible by the system. He often programmed games without taking notes, preferring to finish them as quickly as possible before he forgot the code. He's also credited as the sole programmer of the first Final Fantasy, an extremely complex game when considering the era and the hardware. Read up on him if you'd like. The man is a genius and doesn't get enough credit for pushing the boundaries of what early computer hardware systems could achieve. It becomes even more amazing when considering that almost anyone can make a game nowadays, using IDE's such as GameMaker Studio or Unity. ",

But in general take any of the lock picking systems in common games, elder scrolls and fallout3+ for example.  What are these adding to the game?  Fun?  I certainly don't think so.  Accomplishment?  For what?  Completing a completely unfun minigame that sucks complete ass?  Sounds more like a complete waste of time to me.\n\nWhy does every major RPG these days feel the need to add in shitty minigames for all of their mechanics?

        "text": "About an idea, Organic Questing : \n\nI was thinking about ways to **surpass and go beyond the classic quests system** in RPG (player &gt; Npc &gt; demand &gt; action &gt; Npc &gt; reward).\n\nAnd at the same time, I realized that even in modern RPGs , the game world is very static (nothing really changes from start to end, towns are the same, balance is the same, people are at the same place...).\n\nAnd came up with this general idea , that I called Organic Questing\n\nBasically, instead of having NPCs waiting for you to trigger quests, they would go on with their lives and you will have the opportunity to \"enter\" their lives for a period of time and it will serve as a quest.\n\nTo alienate the fear of missing out, these opportunities will be recurring.\n\n**I. Let me give an example** :\n\nMedieval times (thing Kingdome Come) You are in town A.\nThere is a woodcutter. He has a house and workshop. \nHe goes to the forest with his apprentice and his tools and cart, 3 times a week.\n\nNow, you can, if you want, avoid that guy and never speak to him, but , along the game (based on AI and RNG) , this can happen :. \n\n\n- the wood cutter can get attacked by bandits at his forest camp (depends if such bandits are still alive and roaming in forest)\n- the apprentice can get lost in the woods. \n- his tools get stolen.  \n- his forest camp burns, he needs to set another one.   \n\nOf course the AI will make sure things don't get ridiculous (apprentice abducted 5 times in a row...)\n\nNow these events are not quests. They happen and you can never know about it.\n\n**II. consequence, but** : \n\n\nIf any of these happen, then :.   \n\n- After a few days, the wood cuter is not present in his workshop (in case he was attacked , killed or abducted). \n- prices of some wood based products go up.  \n- people start talking about these events \n- production of wood is slow (apprentice is abducted)\n\nNobody will explicitly ASK you to save the guy, but the world will imply that it would be good for you to do it.\n\nIf you don't​, maybe a new woodcutter will arrive from another town, or maybe wood will be brought by cart from another town (risk of again bandits attack? So not a permanent solution.....)\n\n\n**III. What does the player do then ? That would resemble quests** : \n\n\n- Maybe , early , you will go see the woodcutter and propose that you go with him several mornings in order to assess the security. There, maybe you thwart off an attack. You follow the bandits , and you kill them. Case solved ?\n\n- Maybe you didn't hear about the woodcutter before the bad events. And you go and save his apprentice after.\n\n**IV. Then how does the world evolve ?** :   \n\n- if you save the woodcutter one day, you convince him to hire a guard. Thus his business rises. Thus his house workshop gets bigger and **new building are built in town**, the town flourishes and the local Lord gets a good army and....    \n- this new army created , there are now jobs as private mercenary / soldiers .... \n- apprentice gets better life, he marries a woman, they like you and help you later..   \n- prices of  wood based products go down. You profit.   \n- they build a fence around town.  \n- there is a now a caravan of wood export from this town A to the town B. Again this can create more organic quests ???\n\n\nThe idea is that the state of the game world (insecurity, prices inflating, missing people ) will \"motivate you\" to do things..  that resemble quests.\n\nThis idea can be applied to many (not all type of quests ) . Of course there would still be the occasional fetch quest or kill quests, but they would be the exception not the norm.\n\n\nThe idea is still rough, there may be a problem with how to engage player ( most players still need some directions , pointers ...)\n\nTherefore , within this system, there will need to be very clear and powerful motivation mechanics in order to make the player do things....\n.\n\nThe end goal here is to **GET RID** of the quest journal. The system will need to be so efficient that the game world alone , by itself , will INFORM the player that things need to get done....\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think ?\n\n...\n",

        "text": "**TL;DR: A lot of the accessibility of fighting games comes, even ones with good tutorials or relatively accessible controls, comes from small, highly-skilled playerbases that make playing online extremely frustrating and discouraging.  Going with a free-to-play model similar to MOBAs instead of charging $20-60 and trying to make up for the price tag with a story mode could lead to more players trying the games, which in turn would lead to new and/or bad players having less trouble finding equally-skilled opponents online.**\n\nFighting games being an extremely inaccessible genre has been a topic of discussion in the gaming community for a while.  There's a lot of talk about how fighting games can become more accessible without losing their depth and incredibly high skill-cap.  A lot of discussions I see seem to see a few main things as the solutions: More accessible controls so player feel less frustrated just learning to control their character, large amounts of single-player content so that players struggling on line have something to do and can get their money's worth, and deep tutorials explaining the details of fighting games to help players improve.\n\nDragonBall FighterZ has been getting a lot of praise for doing the first two extremely well.  It has vastly more accessible controls than most 2D fighting games and a suite of single-player content, including a lengthy story mode and three different arcade modes.  Its tutorials are only okay, but there are other fighting games that have gotten praise for great tutorials, like Skullgirls.  But in both of those games, you'll still see the same complaint: After playing the tutorial and story mode and learning the essentials of their favorite character(s), players go online and consistently get completely destroyed, often giving up with a terrible winrate before they get better.\n\nI think there's a key thing going on here: **The accessibility of a fighting game is determined as much, if not more, by the availability of equally-skilled opponents as it is by the difficulty of the mechanics.**  It doesn't matter if you suck at the game if your opponent sucks just as much.  It doesn't matter if you can perform combos and special moves easily if you still can't find an opponent online who you can touch.\n\nOf course, the main way to solve this problem is by having a lot of people play the game, and that's obviously something every company wants to do anyway.  Having the solution to the niche-ness of fighting games be \"make a super-popular mainstream fighting game\" seems unproductive.  But I think maybe the issue is the current pricing model.\n\nMost fighting games, especially the AAA, mainstream ones that have the most potential to really become popular like Street Fighter or DragonBall FighterZ, have a big price tag.  Street Fighter V costs $40, Dragonball FighterZ costs $60, and both have $30+ season passes to get DLC characters coming out in the future on top of those price tags.  Those price tags are pretty damn scary to people who aren't hardcore fighting game fans and just interested in giving the games a try.  $40-60 is a big price to play for a game where you know you might just go online, get crushed a bunch, get frustrated, and give up.\n\nSo these games try to make up for that with good single-player modes.  A full Arcade Mode was one of the big features of Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition (on top of the free story mode DLC that had come out earlier), and a lengthy story mode was one of the selling points of DragonBall FighterZ.  But that only does so much.\n\n**Instead of using story modes to justify the price to casual players, maybe these games need to get rid of the price.**  Fighting games seem well-suited to a MOBA-style pricing model: they've got a huge cast of playable characters, but many people focus on only one or two.  You don't even have to worry about screwing up your team by not having access to a certain role or counterpick like in MOBAs because it's one on one.\n\n**Going F2P would attract a lot of players who are hesitant about the genre to give it a try.  Lots of players trying out the game means new/bad players have lots of other new/bad players to play against.  New players having other equally-skilled players to play against makes the game more fun, and makes them more likely to keep playing instead of getting frustrated and quitting.**\n\nSo, assuming the pricing model is fair, do you think this would help with the inaccessibility of the genre?  Are there things I'm overlooking that would make a free-to-play model impossible to do fairly (i.e. not pay-to-win or otherwise customer-unfriendly) in fighting games that I'm overlooking?",

(Seriously, how different is Warframe from BDO in monetization that you would consider one a disgrace and the other a masterful usage of mtx?)\n\nIt's so incomprehensible that obvious issues like the ones brought up of Fortnite are unfixed. It's even worse that people are so far down the MTX rabbit hole that you could go onto any type of forum about any game and see absolutely no mention of their largest issues. It's just lootboxes this, gambling that. ",

Here’s a few of the options that I’ve sorted out, if you guys wouldn’t mind giving some input. \n\nOption 1, fixed party members. A choice of three party members between the six presented to you early on in the game. These party members are with you from start to finish and cannot be killed off. Similar system to Dragon Quest 3 or Kingdom Hearts\n\nOption 2, all completely interchangeable members. You venture through the game taking on multiple party members who you can swap out, however, these characters are susceptible to perma-death. Similar system to Lisa the Painful RPG\n\nOption 3, mix between the two. At the beginning of the game you choose one permanent companion out of six who can’t be killed off, and you have two slots for interchangeable members that you meet thought the world who can be killed off. \n\nAny input from you guys on this would be great. Which do you think would be more engaging or unique? Thanks to all :)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7y6ss2/the_holy_trinity_in_mmos_and_how_it_could_be/",
        "text": "The holy trinity in MMOs consists of separating the playable classes into 3 roles or archetypes: tank, healer and dps.\n\nTanks' job is to draw the attention of the enemy and soak all the potential damage to protect the other roles.  \nHealer's job is to heal any damage received by the tank or any other damage received by other players.  \nDPS' job is to deal as much damage as possible.\n\nPopularized by World of Warcraft, it is widely considered an archaic system that is too restrictive to build variety, with many games trying to do away with it, namely Guild Wars 2.\n\nThe result is that during the early stages of guild wars 2, there was only 1 build that was considered \"meta\", the berserker's stats build (+power, +precision, +ferocity) which is straight up damage and nothing else, effectively ruining the build variety of the game. At one point only warriors were considered good for the late game content (lv50 fractals)\n\nThis eventually prompted arenanet to fix it and reintroduce the classic trinity of roles in their first expansion, Heart of Thorns, in the endgame PvE raids.\n\nHowever, a very peculiar thing happened, the trinity evolved, and up until right before the second expansion, the meta solidified as follows:\n\n* Mesmers are considered the tanks in GW2, they are not the class with the highest HP, and they can only wear light armor. The mesmer's job in a raid is to control everything, and the way it \"tanks\" damage is by negating, evading and blocking it with point defense abilities. They are also highly desired due to their unique buffs, which increase action speed and reduce cooldowns. Technically a thief could be just as effective if not more at evade tanking than a mesmer, but you would never, ever use someone to facetank damage from a boss.\n\n* Elementalists and guardians can output more healing per second than the top healer class, the druid. This is because the only reason you would ever need a healer in GW2 raids is for point healing. The tank, if played correctly, should be able to avoid 100% of all damage, and because of that, the raids were designed to have global damage over time tick debuffs, to keep players on their toes, and make healers useful. The main reason why druids are considerd the best healers is because they can deliver enough healing to sustain the party, while providing some overpowered buffs like up to 50% increase to all damage.\n\n* DPS is still your good old dps, just that apparently in GW2 sticks lit on fire are more effective than swords, axes, pistols, rifles and bows, only because burning a boss down with fire is more effective than shooting it in its face.\n\nThis prompted me to brainstorm a more advanced version of the holy trinity that could be a lot more engaging and less archaic than the one popularized by wow. The system in GW2 is quite evolved, but it's still very limited in terms of variety. You have 4/9 classes viable for endgame raids, and they all have 1/2 builds usable, physical damage is strictly inferior in all situations against condition damage, and there is usually only 1 strategy to beat any raid encounter, and relies on the mesmer playing perfectly.\n\nHere's what I came up with:\n\n* Tanks should be evade tanks, and should be a role reserved for the swift, agile class such as rogue, assassin, thief, etc.. Their job is to mainly draw aggro from the boss, and prevent it from targetting the less mobile classes. Their role also involves having complete control over the battlefield, kmowing exactly how the boss behaves, and the multiple phases of the fight.\n\n* DPS role should be removed and incorporated into every player's kit, I.e. Every player has the responsibility to dish out enough damage to pull their own weight. Having a class solely dedicated to dps is one of the archaic parts of the old trinity system, this is because having a dps class reduces the pool of viable dps to, at most, 2 classes and forces the developers to play whack a mole balance with the top dps classes. This would also require an overhaul on the way player equipment is thought of, with not all equipment pieces being able to give bonuses to any type of stat, and limiting, for example, damage traits to weapons only and defensive traits to armor and shields only.\n\n* Healer class should also be a utility class. Utility is general buffing, and should look much alike the druid in GW2, not only responsible for keeping the party topped up, but also having high uptime on the different buffs it can provide the party.\n\n* Introduce a new class whose job is to \"point soak\" unavoidable damage. Should be reserved for heavy armor, bulky and tanky classes like warriors, guardians, etc... No doubt there will be sources of damage that the tank can't funnel, such as wide area AoEs, bouncing debuffs and adds, this class will use abilities with long cooldowns or high resource requirements to transfer damage from other party members to themselves, or straight up negate the blow with a shield and a defensive stance, while protecting everyone behind them.\n\nNo doubt any MMO implementing such system will still devolve into 2-3 top classes with one possible, optimized build for all encounters, but this kind of system will, at least, make the gameplay of each role more engaging and most importantly, distinct from other roles.",

The game seems to be very much about immersion and \"your usual bullshit won't work here\" (no savescumming, no taking your time while everyone waits on you, no plot armor...) seems to be a big theme of this game.\n\nThis is when I was reminded exactly this kind of gameplay is a way of playing games I miss from the earlier 3d open-world games when scripts were not as perfect as they are today.\n\nI very fondly remember GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, Mafia I and II for a distinct reason: these games were not perfect by any metric and you had a lot of room to goof around your own way and still win.\n\nIn GTA 3 and Vice, in almost every mission i tried to \"cheat\" in some way the game allowed by normal mechanics.\nThe game expects me to do a fistfight? Lets try running everyone over with a truck and see if that counts as a win. They want me to do a race? Let's move to the other side of the map before the race starts,  get a rocket launcher, and blow every opponents car up and drive to the finish line in a leisurely pace. A firefight is a little too hard? There has to be a way to get a tank or attack helicopter... Let me stress that it was not about saving time: more often than not, the game detected that i was trying to \"cheat\" with ingame methods and fail the mission. Trying every possible way to \"cheat\", i would spend two or three times as much  time trying to cheat the game than it would have taken me to do it the right way. I also do not enjoy \"real cheating\" (with cheatcodes or trainers) in any way - it has to be done with ingame methods, and in a way the game didn't see coming.\n\nAs games get more and more perfect, this kind of gameplay gets more rare and difficult to pull off and come by. For immersion and storytellings sake, I completely understand it. However, for me the ridiculous nature of gameplay and story dissonance was what made it really great.\nI had some moments with GTA IV as well: Niko rambling about being tired of violence in every dialogue while I went on an ingame killing spree whenever I had a chance to it brought back memories. Also in GTA V, I made a point of exactly behaving the opposite you would expect from the story character for everyone of the 3 player chararcters.\n\nI had great hope for the Saints Rows series because ridiculousness seemed to be their thing, but the game experience felt completely on rails and devoid of fun to me. Just cause was the same thing: If the game is about causing havoc, I don't feel like it.\n\nDo you feel similar about older vs. current open-world games? Do you know any other open-world games where you can pull these cheeky old-school shenanigans off? Please recommend them to me :)\n",

        "text": "In case you're unfamiliar with his work, he's a YouTube content creator with a focus primarily on analysing game design and its principles. You can check out his channel, Game Maker's Toolkit, [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337/featured)\n\nSomething I've noticed about a lot of his videos as I watch them is, whilst well produced with high production values, easily consumable, and generally entertaining throughout, they tend to be very *shallow*, and I often come away feeling as though either I hadn't learnt anything because of how obvious or apparent the lesson is, or that I've already known about and experienced the concepts discussed for a very long time through conversations with like minded friends and an extensive gaming \"career\" (I mean this as a player of games, not someone who's part of the industry).\n\nWhat bothers me the most about his content is not the content in and of itself, it's how his audience seems to think his videos are really, *really*, good. Personally, I feel as though his content never really digs too deep into the subject matter, usually only barely scratching the surface of a much larger iceberg, and never doing any *real* analysis, keeping his scope limited to primarily observations which are mostly very obvious (sometimes providing a single alternative perspective which has its benefits), but regardless, his audience tend to really elevate the things he says to a whole new level, as though he is a real authority in game design.\n\nDon't get me wrong, he does make videos where he's more or less 'reporting' on what other professionals in the business say, (such as his AI video), where it's mostly other peoples input and Mark Brown is serving as a convenient collection and presenter of all this information, all in the one place. My issue lies with the videos where he makes his own analysis. Whenever he does, the analysis comes off as very lacklustre. They hardly critically evaluate any single point to completion, they don't approach arguments from multiple angles or perspectives, nor does he consider counter arguments or opposition to his perspecitve. (In truth, most game analysis channels tend to suffer the same issues, Mark Brown's just seems to suffer the worst). Instead his analyses are constructed by comparing the subject matter to a very subjective idealisation of how the subject *should* be, again without accounting for potential arguments against it, rather than beginning from what the subject *is* then building up from there. Yet, despite all this, I've seen more than one comment treating the things he's said as gospel.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I am a fan of his and I have been watching since his earlier videos. He can sometimes convey very nuanced points in a very simple and straight forward manner than can help really crystallise a game design concept in my mind (e.g. Puzzle vs Problem solving). His content serves very well as an introduction to subjects which you may not know about or know very little of (e.g. Ico's Subtractive game design, at least in my case), and maybe that is the whole extent of the purpose of his videos (I'd argue it goes beyond that, in my opinion). At the very least, to practice what I preach and provide some counter arguments of my own, it seems only natural that his audience, who are probably fans of his content, would praise said content as being very high quality - that's just what fans do. So this observation on my part may be as a result of some survivorship bias at play. Perhaps the purpose his videos serve are at odds with what I'm looking for, and as such my criticisms are rendered invalid since I'm arguing for one thing whilst the videos deliver on something completely different. Maybe this write up is a result of any insecurity I have, seeing as Mark Brown is getting hundreds of thousands of views for something I apparently think is very easy, and I'm just seeking some validation (though seriously, I'm open to dissenting opinions, so fire away and tell me why I might be wrong).\n\nIn truth, I'm posting here since Game Maker's Toolkit would appear to be something of a haven for this type of subreddit and a source of endless discussion, but I rarely see any mention of his content here (disregarding the post made a yesterday about his most recent video). So what do you think, r/truegaming? How do you feel about Mark Brown and Game Maker's Toolkit?",
