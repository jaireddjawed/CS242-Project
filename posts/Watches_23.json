        "author": "Amesb34r",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11nwo02/ball_i_love_ball_watches_but_im_very_dissapointed/",
        "text": "First and foremost, I love almost everything about Ball watches. I love the history, the uniqueness, the materials, the precision, etc. If you don't like Ball watches, that's fine, this post is in regards to their website. (But you're wrong if you don't like the watches, just so we're clear.)  \n\nBecause I am so fond of these watches, I spend a lot of time on their website wondering which model to purchase. I seem to find something different that catches my eye almost daily. Eventually it got to the point where I wanted to do some side-by-side comparisons because I couldn't keep all of the features of each watch in my head while looking at comparable models. This is when I really started to see the weakness of the website.   \n\nFor instance, if you look at the description at the top of the Engineer Master II collection page, it states: \"...  In nautical environments, our dive watches meet the strict requirements of professional deep-sea diving with superb innovations, such as an internal rotating bezel fitted with luminous micro gas tubes. ...\" You will find out (with a little investigation) that their deepest rated dive watches are not in the Engineer Master II collection. They are in fact in a collection that doesn't mention dive watches at any point in its description, but does mention water resistance. \n\nFWIW, I have reached out to Ball to express a few of my concerns. Their reply makes me think they either didn't understand what I was trying to say, or they don't care. FYI, my email to them was much more succinct than the following novella. I don't know what I am hoping to achieve with this post other than to vent my frustration and give a few people a glimpse into the mind of someone diagnosed with ADD who [doesn't have access to medication](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/health/adderall-shortage-adhd/index.html).   \n\nLet's begin!  \n\n[This is the result](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/) when you search for the Ball watch homepage. I speak english so I select that language and am [taken to this page](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/home.html). Simple enough and no problems yet. Now, there are several directions to go if you want to see or purchase a timepiece and each has... issues.  \n\nLet's start at the top. Literally. At the top of the page you can select \"Collections\". Doing so will bring you [to this page](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections.html). There are 9 categories here so let's select one of the options at random, say, Engineer II, and [we land here](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections/series/engineer-ii---1.html). There are 8 watches to choose from. Everyone raves about the Marvelight watch so let's check it out! [BOOM](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections/engineer-ii---1/marvelight---nm2026c-s6j-be---796.html)! A larger than life picture of the watch and I have the chance to see the features by selecting the \"Features\" option in the lower left corner! I click on the features options and... nothing. I click again. Nothing. Oh well, I'll just scroll down to see what else there is and... Hey, I found the features! Odd, but whatever. There's an X here so I click it and then... there's another \"Features\" button...  \n\nOkay, so they used more features buttons than required but who cares! At least the price is right here and... oh, it's not. I have to scroll back up and tell them to \"REVEAL THE PRICE\". Why? Apparently it's because they need to [open another tab to tell me that I can't order this watch](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/NM2026C-S6J?search=Marvelight&amp;model=NM2026C-S6J-SL) because pre-orders aren't allowed in my location. Huh? Nobody said anything about pre-ordering.  \n\nWell, I guess I'll go back and look at [that sweet moonphase watch](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections/engineer-ii---1/moon-phase---nm2282c-sj-be---2375.html). Can we see the price of this one? [We can!](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/NM2282C-SJ-GY?search=Moon%20Phase&amp;category_id=26&amp;model=NM2282C-SJ-BK) Why do we need to open a new tab for this though?  \n\nAnyway, let's go back up to the top and click on Collections again. What do you mean you don't see that option? Wait, I don't see it either. There are some lines at the top left so I guess we can click there. Hey, a menu! Okay, we were looking at the Engineer II collection of 8 watches so let's select that from the drop down menu and...  \n\n[25 watches](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/ball-watches/engineer-ii). How the eff did we go from 8 watches to 25? And where is that Marvelight? And where did these other models come from? Timetrekker? Best Steel? These definitely weren't on the other Engineer II page. And what are these bright colored circles in the top right corner of each picture? Oh, it shows the availability of each model. The orange circles simply say \"restocking\". WTF does that mean? Is there a guy in the warehouse putting boxes on shelves? Whatever, I'm only interested in the ones with the green circles because I don't want to wait for months (or longer?) so I'll just sort for those. We scroll up and find that there is no sort function. That sucks. What website doesn't allow you sort?  \n\nOkay, then maybe we'll at least compare some of these models. I like the Arabic and the Ohio at the top of the page. I can see one is a day-date and the other is just a date. What else is different? We'll select them and compare the differen... What? We can't? Ball apparenly doesn't want you to compare one model to another. Odd. Maybe they don't want any of the watches to feel attacked.  \n\nOkay, back to the menu! I'm sure the other collections are easier to work with!  \n\n\\*Narrator\\*: They were not.  \n\nLet's choose [Engineer III](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/ball-watches/EIII) this time! These must be 50% better than Engineer II, right? Unfortunately, we'll never know since we can't compare models.  \n\nHey everyone! We've found the Marvelight watches! They've been upgraded(?) to Engineer III status. Oh no, the little yellow circles are telling me that these are another pre-order situation and we've already learned that I don't live in an area that allows pre-orders. But hey, a guy can dream, right? Let's try to add it to the cart and see what happens. After some clicking and waiting, it's in the cart! It's a miracle! My area has suddenly been shifted into the pre-order zone! I wonder if that will affect my property taxes...  \n\nFYI, for those of you wondering, there are 69 (nice) watches shown on this Engineer III page while there are only 20 on [the other Engineer III page](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections/series/engineer-iii---78.html) that we would have gotten to had we selected that one at the beginning of our journey. Speaking of that other page, I really like [these Starlight models](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/collections/engineer-iii---78/starlight--40mm----nm2182c-s12-be1---2343.html). It's a shame that they apparently don't sell them, as there is no price, nor any way to purchase one.  \n\nAt this point, we have to assume that the \"other\" pages are old models and those pages are left over from some point in the past. Why, oh why then, would they be so easily accessible from the \"Collections\" option on the [FIRST PAGE YOU ARE SHOWN](https://www.ballwatch.com/global/en/home.html)?  \n\nMy emotions are getting the better of me so I'll try to get us back on track. Let's go back to that sweet little menu. What in the world is \"[Watchfinder](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/watchfinder)\"? Hey! It's the sort feature that we couldn't find before! Awesome! Now we're getting somewhere!  \n\n\\*Narrator\\*: They were not.  \n\nLet's say we want a GMT model with a transparent case back. Those are awesome to look at from either side! From the results let's select the [Roadmaster Marine GMT](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/DG3030B-S1CJ-BK) with the black dial and Batman bezel. It looks good from the front so let's see what the back looks like... and we can't. We scroll up, we scroll down, we click buttons, but we can't see anything except a straight-on shot of the front. But we can see the lume, so that's something. Right?  \n\nMaybe we can choose [this rootbeer option](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/DG3030B-S3C-BK). Also, no pictures. Someday, one of the people at Ball will accidentally set down their watch down the wrong way and realize that there is a completely different side to the watch than the one that faces up while on the wrist. Wait, why is there no price and it says out of stock? Is that guy in the warehouse even doing anything? Does this mean it's forever gone or is it coming back when they hire some better help for the warehouse?  \n\nUgh, okay back to the [Watchfinder](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/watchfinder). I definitely don't want to look through models that are out of stock so let's just filter those out... and we can't. Wait, what? I can sort by the color of the tritium gas tubes but I can't leave out models that they don't even have?!?! FINE!  \n\nI'm calm, I'm calm, I just need to remind myself that some things are beyond technology.  \n\nSince we're on the Watchfinder page already, let's look for watches that are over 40mm since we have large wrists. (I'm assuming your wrists are the exact same as mine) Let's select 42mm and 43mm. Aaaaaaannnd... [we've broken the webpage](https://shop.ballwatch.ch/en/watchfinder&amp;filter=18,17). Apparently selecting more than one size is also beyond technology. FINE! We can just uncheck one of the buttons and we'll be able to look at each size individually. \n\n\\*Narrator\\*: They were not.  \n\nYou can't uncheck the buttons if you break the page!?!?!? You have to start over at the beginning or delete a number from the URL?!?!?!?  \n\nFINE!  \n\n\\*FIN\\*",
