        "text": "Even with the existence of this “proto-Indo European” (PIE) language, since Indo-Sanskrit came to exist way before English, Latin and “Germanic” languages, it logically follows then that Indo Sanskrit was the next in line derivation from this PIE, and then afterwards Latin Germanic and English languages were derived from it; this point of European historians that English and other European languages were directly derived from PIE and not from a Indo-Sanskrit absolutely does not make any sense, because if that was true, then English, Latin, Germanic and other European languages would’ve come to exist at the same time as Indo-Sanskrit! But is this the case?- Obviously not…so since Indo-Sanskrit emerged loooong before these other languages, these other languages obviously could not come into existence without Indo-Sanskrit, besides, by the time Indo Sanskrit showed up as a language, the PIE language and civilization had probably already ceased to exist, so how the heck could the later European languages possibly be directly derived from a no longer existing language?, whereas Indo-Sanskrit language and civilization *was still existing when European languages came into existence, therefore they can only come to existence based on older civilizations and languages that were still in existence at the time…it’s like saying you want to construct a wheel, so would you rely on old archaeological rocks with images of wheels (akin to the no longer existent PIE), or would you instead rely on a wheel that has already been created (Indo Sanskrit language) to design your own wheel?? The fact that European historians gloss over and ignore such simple logic which highlights an easily seen flaw in their argument makes one think that either they are ignorant of this, or they know their argument is flawed, but they just don’t want to admit that European languages are derived from Indo-Sanskrit; this isn’t surprising since much of this knowledge is influenced by old ethnocentric European generations who wrote their first biased and prejudiced versions of history back then…",

Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam (a country without a language is a country without a soul), Béarlachas isn´t our language.

        "text": "In a now removed discussion someone claimed that Sanskrit was very special because it used derivation a lot. They showed me [this site](https://uttishthabharata.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/sanskrit/), where it was said amongst others that Sanskrit was special because it had derivation, and very few nouns, and that this meant that in Sanskrit words referred to properties rather than objects. So I glanced at it and tried to explain to him that even if Sanskrit uses derivation more than most other languages, this was rather a difference of degree rather than a unique feature of Sanskrit. But there is even something more fundamental wrong with the reasoning on that website. On the one hand, I can assume that if the word for *tree* in Sanskrit is derived from a word meaning \"something that is cut and felled down\", (Wiktionary seems to disagree with that derivation, but I know next to nothing about Sanskrit, so perhaps Wiktionary is wrong), it has now been conventionalized and now it means *tree.* On the other hand you could argue, and it is indeed the position of most formal semanticians as far as I am aware, that in English the word *tree* also refers to a property, namely the property of being a tree. There is probably more wrong with that site, but it is 1:30 AM here and I really should go to bed.",

Slavic urheimat moved to the Balkans.\n- Albanian being \"oldest\", often with vague word lists.\n- Hungarian not being Uralic, but the language of the huns or even the sumerians.\n- Modern Greek being identical to ancient Greek, no sound changes at all.\n- Various theories about turkish being proto-everything.\n- The idea that Romanian either is the most conservative romance language, or the opposite, not a romance language at all but a separate IE language derived from Dacian.\n\nWhile there are similar ideas popping up elsewhere, I can't think of any other place in Europe where it is as widespread.",
