        "text": "With so much processed food these days that has been linked to cancer and other general unhealthiness, I wonder if it is more damaging than good. I can find some answers online related to junk food in general, which is that it is better to eat junk food than to eat nothing. But there is nothing specific I can find about processed foods, only that they are thought to cause (possibly fatal) cancer. That would make me think that it would be worse than not eating enough, but I don't know enough about either to really be sure. I know both are probably pretty okay in the short term, but I'm more curious about long term effects. \n\nDoes anyone have any info or thoughts on this? Or any other subreddits that might be good about this topic? Thanks so much!\n\n(if this is the wrong place to post this, im sorry  üò¢ . not sure what subreddit to post in. I hope this doesn't come off as a personal situation, i really am just curious)",

At that point, it‚Äôs really hard to feed myself, and I end up in a terrible cycle for a few days, sometimes more. \n\nI don‚Äôt usually keep a lot of easy snacks around, which makes it hard to get out of the cycle, because everything I have takes effort I don‚Äôt have. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on keeping a couple unhealthy, but calorie dense snacks around for these times? Rice Krispie bars, or something like that? I know it‚Äôs not nutritious, but do you think it can successfully jumpstart me out of this cycle, so that I can get back to normal faster?",

        "text": "I ask because I recently picked up some salsa from Good and Gather, the Pineapple Peach variety to be specific. The label says it only contains 1g of sugar plus 2g of added sugar, yet it tastes so sweet. There are no artificial sweeteners in the ingredients list, but the label says it does contain a \"Bioengineered Food Ingredient\". Can someone help me solve this mystery because this salsa tastes so sweet, but the Nutrition Facts don't seem to indicate that it has much sugar at all. I've had a similar experience with  Tia Lupita hot sauce, which tastes really salty, with next to no sodium. Is there something about Nutrition Labels that I'm missing here?",
