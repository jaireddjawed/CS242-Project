        "text": "Net neutrality has been a prominent issue over the past few years. A major concern of the pro-neutrality side is that ISPs might harm sites by arbitrarily slowing down the connection speed of people trying to visit said sites, which could be used to drive competitors out of business. Opponents of net neutrality argue that customers could simply choose ISPs that don’t limit traffic in that way, but proponents argue that ISPs are effectively monopolies in many parts of the country.\n\nMore recently, conservatives have been voicing concerns that major online platforms such as Google, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter\n have an anti-conservative bias. Some have even argued that these platforms are so essential to public discourse that they should be treated as public forums. Others argue that these platforms should be free to refuse service to people based on their conduct.\n\nObviously, most people think that comparing these two situations is comparing apples to oranges. However, all compromises involve both sides accepting something they don’t really like; is there any way that a deal could be made? Would it be worthwhile to both sides? Would it be politically feasible?\n\nOne issue is that net neutrality is fairly well-defined, while there’s no clear definition for what a “site neutrality” law would look like. If you support NN, what kind of concessions would you consider making? If you think there needs to be some kind of legal requirement for significant websites to remain neutral, what kind of law would you want to be passed if you needed to reinstate net neutrality in order to do so?",

In the most extreme example, Wyoming has a little under 600,000 people compared to California's 39.5 million--that's a ratio of 1.5 to 100.  \n\nWould a national proportional vote instead for the senate do much better? You would vote for a party rather than a person and then based off of that, seats are doled out based on percentage of vote. This would solve a few problems:  \n\n* Make the Senate a more democratic representation of the United States\n* Introduce third parties and reduce spoiler votes and strategic voting\n* Equalize the population disparity\n\nThe biggest objection I see to this is people losing their own state senators, which I could see people not being comfortable with. But if there are other issues I would like to know about them.  ",

        "text": "Hello everyone, and welcome to the weekly polling megathread for the 2018 U.S. midterms. All top-level comments should be for individual polls released within the last week *only*. \n\nUnlike submissions, top-level comments do not need to ask a question. **However, they must summarize the poll in a meaningful way**; link-only comments will be removed. Discussion of those polls should take place in response to the top-level comment. \n\nTypically, polls posted in this thread must be from a [538-recognized pollster](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/). If you see a dubious poll posted, please let the team know via report. Feedback is welcome via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalDiscussion). \n\nEdit: We encourage sorting this thread by 'new'. The 'suggested sort' feature has been [broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8ok7sz/posts_opened_in_a_new_tab_still_do_not_sort/) by the redesign and automatically defaults to 'best'. ",
