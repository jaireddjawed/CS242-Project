        "text": "Concrete mixers are big, ungainly things.  Trying to maneuver them around a crowded jobsite is like trying to play miniature golf with a tennis ball.  The biggest problem is, of course, other people, specifically other people's cars.  Nobody is going to lug 50 pounds of tools any further than they have to, so if there is an open space near where they want to be, they park there, never mind that it is right next to a sidewalk or directly across from a driveway that a crew is obviously prepping.  It only makes things worse when it's done by people who should know better (and done intentionally).  \n  \nSo, we're pumping a grout walls in the late afternoon, which already has me in a bit of a mood.  Grout jobs tend to be very slow.  Each cinder block has two cells, and the crew [pumps the grout into those cells](http://www.asilo.com/house/pictures/pouring-grout.jpg) filling them all the way to the top of the wall.  Grout is really just a term for a weak concrete mix that is pumped super wet.  It has to be that wet to make it all the way to the bottom of the wall, otherwise it sticks to the sides of the cinder blocks (or gets caught up on steel reinforcement).  There is a lot of stopping and starting, as well as a lot of moving the pump.  It all takes time, during which that concrete starts to go off and stiffen up.  Things only get worse on a hot day, and the subs will do anything to get more water in the load (heroin addicts looking for a fix have nothing on grout pumpers eyeballing your last 20 gallons).  \n  \nAs we move to a new street, we find a line of cars parked all along the side of the street we are working on, just far enough apart to take up as much space as possible without leaving enough room to get the pump in there.  Turns out it is another concrete crew setting up to do patios.  No problem, we're all concrete guys here, and they know how it is.  We ask them to move.  That I am writing this post tells you what their response was.  It turns out they are waiting for their own pump and mixer to show up, and they intentionally blocked the street because they don't want us to be in their way.  Their crew chief tells us we can wait for them to finish and move on, or we can just work around them.  \n  \nIt's pretty obvious he expects us to wait.    Waiting is, of course, going to make the concrete go off even more and will rack up standby charges for the customer, but trying to work around their cars is going to mean blocking the street and rolling up the hose every time we move (normally the crew just drags/carries it down the sidewalk, but we can't do that with the cars in the way).  It would take much longer; depending on when their pump shows up, it might not even save us any time.  Still, Todd the pumper rolls his pump right up next to the lead car and feeds his hose out around it.  \n  \nAt the best of times, a concrete pump farts and sputters like a nervous chihuahua, flinging small globs of concrete out the hopper.  If the driver isn't paying attention and *accidentally* lets the concrete level get too low, the pump sucks in air.  Feeding a concrete pump air is like feeding a hippopotamus Olestra; shit's not pretty, and it gets everywhere.  We probably end up moving that pump twice as many times as we have to, but it ensures that every single one of those cars gets to spend some quality time next to the hopper.  \n  \nWe finish are done with the job and are washing out the pump when the crew chief (whose own concrete and pump still haven't shown up yet) storms over to complain about all the concrete splatter on their cars.  I point out that we told them we'd be pumping there and asked them to move, but they refused.  At this point he sees that I have a truck wash bucket strapped to my water tank and demands I let him use it to clean off his car.  \n  \nI tell him that is a terrible idea, smoking lounge on the Hindenburg levels of terrible.  The stuff we use is designed to dissolve dried concrete, and it will probably damage his car.  The concrete is fresh enough that he can probably just rinse it off with water.  He isn't having it.  He tells me to stop lying; if it doesn't damage my truck, it won't hurt his car.  Besides, he's done this before and knows what he is doing.  \n  \nNow, keeping a concrete mixer clean is a downright Sisyphean task.  No matter how hard you try, chutes overflow, pumps splatter, and plants huff cement powder all over your truck.  There are a variety of chemicals used to clean off concrete, and most of the modern mixes are relatively safe (for something that can dissolve concrete).  Our plants provide a phosphoric acid mix (relatively safe isn't the same as actually safe) to any drivers that need it, so it quite common for there to be a bucket of it stashed somewhere on the truck.  \n  \nOf course, part of what makes these chemicals safer also makes them somewhat less effective.   That's why some of us will bring in our own cleaning products to fortify the company mix.  These are not the friendly chemicals that will just leave you with a mild chemical burn; my bucket of fun dips down to the good old days of leaded gasoline, asbestos and red dye no. 2.  Still, I warned him, and he assured me he knew what he was doing.  Besides, he's intentionally being a jackass and expected my sub to pay standby for his convenience.  I let him have the bucket.  \n  \nI half expect him to stop when he pulls the lid off.  The witch's brew in the bucket smells like Walter White's bathtub.  Somehow, the fact that his nose hairs are curling up like a spider in a flame doesn't seem to faze him.  Brush goes in the bucket.  Brush comes out of the bucket.  Brush slams onto the hood of the car with a wet slap.  I can only watch in mute horror as the man proceeds to not just clear off the concrete, but bathe his entire hood in hydrochloric acid, rubbing it in to get out all those nasty water spots.  It's like watching an orphan unwittingly skin his favorite puppy.  None of us stick around long enough to see the final result, but it is already apparent that he has scrubbed off the clear coat and is in the process of etching brush marks in the paint.  I don't want to be anywhere near him when that hood dries out.  I let him keep the bucket.\n  \nTL/DR:  Another concrete crew tries to preemptively block us from our job so they can do theirs first.  We take their suggestion and work around them, splattering all their cars with concrete in the process.  The offending crew chief then asks to wash his car with my bucket of hydrochloric acid, and, after warning him that it will eat his paint, I let him.",

        "text": "Some names and specifics redacted. This was written in real time on a G Doc shared with select members of my team and my GF who works elsewhere. \n\n\n\n10:00am Team on site with the exception of G (VP) and R (COO)\n\n10:03 G arrives. JJ (annoying colleague)  notes her tardiness.\n\n10:10 am. There is no breakfast. The peasants are restless. Fruit and nut bars and tootsie rolls are apparently the Surgeon General’s new recommended balanced breakfast. Hope is dwindling. \n\n10:15 We are all recording brief selfie videos describing COMPANY. The challenge of sending these videos to G has proven the story of the moment. RA(Colleague) is the odd man out without an Apple device and the incompatibility has prevented the use of the AirDrop function. \n\n10:18 JJ has made clear her displeasure with the first activity, both directly and through pained facial expressions. \n\n10:21 R is absent. He informed G that we should start without him. Others have noted that they would have liked to know this is an option. \n\n10:26 JJ mentions for the second time that the team was in at the prescribed 10:00 am start time with the exception of the two ranking members of our management team.  \n\n10:28 R arrives, exhibiting no signs of remorse or distress at his tardiness. \n\n10:30 After leaving the room to film his video, R returns several minutes later and asks for assistance in recording a video. The Chief Operations Officer promptly receives assistance Operating his computer. \n\n10:32 Various members of the team continue to struggle to send videos to G.\n\n10:33 I eat a mini snickers bar. \n\n10:34 G has yet to successfully send her own video to herself. R returns and informs us his video is only 11 seconds. Hedges against poor performance. \n\n10:35 Non sequitur conversation about RA’s love life. A trail of flowers leading to the bedroom proved a non starter for a woman on their second date. \n\n10:37 Videos begin. A(Colleague) goes first. Pleasant, if slightly insipid. Z(Colleague)  looks very sleepy. RA was monotone. JO(Jr Colleague) timid. G full of wide eyed enthusiasm. N (Colleague) stuttered and shot from an unflattering angle. J phoned it in. I killed it, but JJ felt the need to compare me to an infomercial. Not cool JJ. Not. Cool. R’s video was poor. \n\n10:44 G congratulates team on a job well done, citing my video as a positive example.\n\n10:45 “mission” and “vision” defined. RA calls the website “Shite.”\n\n10:46 Our mission statement displayed on screen with a typo and incomplete punctuation. \n\n10:49 asked to rewrite mission statement:\n\n10:54 The best buzzwords from everyone’s mission statement are being written on a whiteboard, now free of context or substance. \n\n10:57 Z makes a snotty comment about my use of the word “service” twice in a sentence. Game on Z\n\n10:58 Z basks in the barely deserved adulation of his peers for having a marginally better string of buzzwords. \n\n10:59 G shuts that shit DOWN informing Z that his was more of a vision statement than a mission statement. BURN.\n\n11:05 I inform our colleagues I would club baby seals if the price was right.\n\n11:12 We draw vision doodles for the company. Highlights include Paris location, Fortune 500 induction and jetpacks. \n\n11:16 We debate the merits of the term “Farm to Table”\n\n11:19 JJ answers “advantage” but the correct answer was “feature.”\n\n11:26 Next team activity is to film a commercial in groups. Still hungry. I offer to film to avoid further criticism of my on-camera prowess by JJ. \n\n12:57 We reconvene. Our commercial was clearly superior due in large part to the inclusion of early 2000s banger “hot in hurr” by lyrical genius Nelly. Mixed reviews on new lunch wraps.\n\n1:02 I am cited as an example of a “Relationship Builder” sales person. \n\n1:03 Z reads over my shoulder. Not taking his own notes. Poor form, Z.  \n\n1:05 “Sell the dream, service the nightmare.”\n\n1:08 JJ sneezed. Multiple murmurs of “Bless You.” None seem particularly sincere. \n\n1:11 We each are instructed to take an online test to determine what type of salesperson we are. \n\n1:16 RA distracts everyone with running ponderous commentary.\n\n1:17 Quiz says I am a “Consultant,” the most well rounded category of salesperson, surprising noone. \n\n1:20 I eat a mini twix. Earlier resentment of candy being the only food provided by G dwindles as I am no longer operating on an empty stomach. \n\n1:22 N goes first and declares himself “Consultant” stealing my thunder. Survey is flawed. My superiority no longer apparent. \n\n1:24 G is a hunter closer. RA makes creepy joke about holding my hand. Follows quickly by calling R a liar. \n\n1:26 Another mini snickers bar. Girlfriend remotely compromised integrity of my notes by adding in-line commentary.\n\n\n1:29: Boyfriend sucks and needs to share candy with his better half \n\n1:33 Categorized as a Farmer type by G as opposed to a hunter. \n\n1:35 A self identifies as hunter. Accepting nods from her peers. \n\n1:36 JJ calls herself a “stalker.” Uncomfortable mental images of her hiding in the woods outside an idyllic lake house. Knife in hand, lipstick smeared. Prepared to strike. \n\n1:45 15 minute break concludes in less than 10. Heading for an early end? One can only hope. \n\n1:55 Thinking about dumplings. Not a euphemism. Actual dumplings.\n\n2:01 (Me) starts a conversation that is way off topic. -R\n\n2:07 (Me) puts finishing touches on doodle of Stalker JJ\n\n2:10 R excuses himself because the “Insurance Person” is here. \n\n2:21 Last activity of the day announced. RA demands to be on my team. Does Not follow through.\n \n2:38 R comes back to the conference room and realizes there's a shitty activity going on and decides to leave again. \n\n\n2:46 THATS A WRAP! R just happens to walk in as we finish. \n\n\nEdit: TL;DR Boss demanded we take notes during a sales training. I created a live Google Doc shared with half the room and live chronicled a passive aggressive commentary of the day. ",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time post, sorry if format is bad, etc.  \n     Bit of backstory, this long-term substitute teacher (hereby referred to as EB (Evil Bitch) was one that we had my freshman year of high school in lieu of a teacher on maternity leave.\n\n This happened about a month before the end of the year, EB had been teaching for ~2 months. She was not only an awful teacher, but had a terrible attitude towards teaching and most of her students. She would do things like brag about the fact that she took the day off, (!?) fly into a rage and scream at the class for getting up while she was in the middle of saying the sentence \"You may go to lunch,\" and insult kids who asked questions about material she thought she had already covered. Some of the more bold kids would call her out on that sort of thing, and she'd respond by flipping her shit and sending them to the office. The administration probably got used to that, as after the first few times they'd always come back into the classroom seemingly mentally unscathed. \nAnd as a side note, this entire section of the story happened in the span of what was probably around 20 minutes of the same morning.\n\nOne lovely morning, two of my friends and I were hanging out in the library before school started. It was about 7:30 AM and school started at 7:45. We were watching some sort of video on the library computer and laughing, being what was probably a bit too loud for a library, but not exceptionally at all. One of the regular teachers working in the library came over to us from the opposite side of the library and politely asked us to quiet down, which we apologized and did immediately. After also letting us know there was a teachers' meeting starting soon in the library, she walked out the door into the hallway. We weren't really paying attention to our surroundings at the time, but soon enough we noticed EB walking furiously towards us from the other side of the fairly large library. She came up to us, looked me directly in the eyes, and screamed \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?? *JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE WHITE DOESN'T MEAN YOU OWN THE PLACE.*\" I'll never forget those words. EB was white-skinned herself as well. To this day I have no idea why she said what she did.\n\n  \nNow, my high school was extremely stringent on racist remarks and that sort of thing. I had a massive grin on my face knowing she'd get absolutely annihilated by the school administration, and I had multiple witnesses to back me up. I don't remember her exact phrasing, but EB commanded me to come with her to the office because I was \"in trouble.\" Obviously, she didn't pause at all to think about her decisions, or she was just so delusional she thought she was in the right. \"Yes ma'am,\" I replied with a grin. My friends accompanied me to the principal's office. Normally they have a certain process that they did when kids were going into the office, but the principal ushered us in as soon as he saw EB fuming and as we sat down. EB was asked to step out for a moment. The principal asked us \"can you explain to me what happened just now?\" I let him every minute detail of the last 10 minutes, and my friends verified my story. The principal said something along the lines of \"I'm very sorry, I want to let you know that we absolutely support you here at [High School] and that is not acceptable behavior for anyone at all.\" We were released to our first hour class with the promise the situation would be resolved the following morning, and being told that we were to not tell anyone else about the incident. Being the rebellious teenagers we were, we of course told all of our friends immediately. The word spread like wildfire, although nobody could believe what happened.\n\n\nI happened to have EB as my teacher later on the same day, and we had one of the on-hand college grad assistants as a substitute. EB was nowhere to be found for the rest of that day. The next morning in our first hour class we were pulled out of class to have a meeting with a counselor and EB. After some prompting from the counselor, EB begrudgingly apologized, and gave some bullshit excuse that I don't quite remember, but she said something including the words \"my personal life.\" The counselor immediately stared daggers at her, and said \"But some things that might be okay to do in your personal life aren't necessarily okay to do in your professional life, right?\" to which she nodded sheepishly. It seemed like the counselor and/or the principal had majorly chewed her out, and she still didn't really see where she was in the wrong. They would have most likely fired her if it wasn't for the fact that she was the only on-hand substitute who could fill in for the regular teacher's maternity leave, as well as the fact that that teacher's leave was nearly over.\n\n\nSome people are insufferable pricks (not the good kind) who never learn and never admit they're in the wrong. I did exactly what EB told me to do, and it most likely cost her her job. The very day that our regular teacher returned from her leave, EB was gone for good. \n\nTL:DR read it yourself, it'll take you less than 5 minutes.\nEdit: disgusting formatting. Still bad, apologies.",

I am by no means a good story teller so sorry if this is poorly told!\n\n**Story time:**\n\n\nA bit of background: I work IT part-time at a school and have been dealing with a boss who has almost no IT experience which leads to some very unnecessary ordeals from time to time. Typically when he pulls something like this I just quietly go in and fix the problem and just let things go back to normal. Today however I decided to let things ride out and was left with a fair bit of satisfaction.\n\nToday I get a text from my boss saying that one of our teacher's computer had lost some of it's settings for a program they use in their classes. I immediately recognize the cause of the problem, the computer is receiving a script that it shouldn't. I immediately pull up the script in question and confirm that it is indeed the problem. Awesome! This is an easy fix and at this point wont take more than 5-10 seconds to do. So I text my boss the good news:\n\n\n&gt; Me: \"I have a fix for this, I'll get on it\"\n\n&gt; Boss: \"No don't touch that computer, I'll set it up\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Okay, but it will keep wiping those settings until I fix it\"\n\n&gt; Boss: \"No do not touch that computer\" (I don't think he read what I told him)\n\n&gt; Me: \"Okay, all yours\"\n. . .\n\nHe spent 3 hours repeatedly setting up the computer, having it wipe all the changes, and setting it back up again till he finally gave up. Didn't even ask me for help, with it. Only brought it up once he started grumbling about how things were not going well and that one computer keeps wiping my settings! To which I mentioned I knew a fix!... And was met with more grumbling.\n\nTL;DR: Boss tells me not to do a 5 second fix, spends 3 hours failing to fix it.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "Spoiler alert, this is long. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSince it is back to school season once again, I am fondly reminded of my brush with the substitute school nurse in my eighth grade year.\n\nLet me start out by saying that I have a period. That period causes all sorts of side affects, such as cramps, back pain, and you guessed it, nausea. Because of these symptoms, I would be at the nurse about once or twice during my cycle to get some pain medication from my cramps. It was a system that worked for me, because it was quick and I got relief from my pain.\n\nThat is, until the school stopped giving out pain medication. They said that you needed a doctors note to receive Advil. My mom and I never got around to it, but since the nurse was so wonderful, she always called my mom to ask if it was alright to give me Advil. Although I’m sure it was frustrating to continue to do that when we should have gotten a doctors note, she never complained and always helped me out.\n\nThe substitute nurse was a different story.\n\nAlthough the substitute nurse was technically not a nurse and just a lady who worked upstairs, she still filled the roll as nurse when our regular nurse was out for the day. I disliked the substitute nurse, and she hated me as well. So of course the day I’m on my period she happens to be working in the office.\n\nI walked into the nurse’s room. The sub looked up at me and asked what was wrong. I told her that I was having really bad cramps because of my period, and I was hoping she could help me with some pain medication. She asked if I had a doctors note, and I said no, but I could call my mom to ask if I could get some. The sub told me that I could not call my mom and I needed to “tough it out.” I asked one more time, hoping to have some sympathy from another woman. Once again, she said no. \n\nNow, when I don’t get pain medication for cramps, I get extremely nauseous. It’s extremely hard to deal with, which is why I always tried to avoid it. When the nausea hit a half an hour later, I went down to the nurse’s room once again. I’ll write down the conversation. SN will be substitute nurse.\n\nSN: You’re back. \nMe: I’m feeling really nauseous. Can I stay down here for a bit? \nSN: Fine. (Complete with eye roll and everything)\nA few minutes later.\nSN: *tosses me a pack of crackers* here, eat these.\nMe: I don’t think I should eat. I’m gonna be sick if I do.\nSN: If you want to stay, eat the crackers.\n\nBy now, I was a bit ticked off. Ever though she technically shouldn’t give out pain meds, she was rude to me when I asked about calling my mom. Now she was being pushy about eating. She could of thought I was faking, but my friends were concerned because I was pale and sweaty. If they could see it, she probably could too. So, I wanted revenge.\n\nI ate those damn crackers.

SN called my mom and I got picked up. \n\nI feel really bad about it know, because maybe she was just trying to help me. But even now, years later, I still feel a small triumph when I remember her face after I was sick.\n\nTL;DR: Substitute nurse didn’t take me seriously, so I threw up everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So, to start things off: I’m going to try to keep this as anonymous as I can. I work at a very popular chicken restaurant chain that began its life in Atlanta, Georgia. I work the “day shift” which typically starts at 5:30 am and goes until about 2-2:30 pm.\n\nI get to work and everything is going smoothly until one of my managers (we’ll call him jefe, the Spanish word for boss) comes in, and for whatever reason, he’s furious. Not having a good morning. At. All. \n\nA few hours pass by and he’s on our (the kitchen’s) ass all day. I, personally, am about to lose it. We keep falling behind on our food because dozens of burritos are being ordered in short spans of each other, and Jefe does not like this. \n\nSeeing how far behind we are, the catering director sends someone from up front to help us (she will be named Wife). Wife starts to help us make the food because we just can’t keep up with the demand. This is when Jefe walks his uppity ass to the kitchen and demands to know why we don’t have any of the food ready.\n\nWe tell him exactly why, “Burritos are labor-intensive compared to all the other items we have on our menu and we can’t keep up with demand.”\n\nHe asks “Why don’t you have help?”\n\n“Wife is here helping us,” I tell him.\n\n“No she isn’t,” he retorts. Then, looking around he sees wife putting together some burritos. “Oh she is back here!” He huffs a bit, “You guys need to tell me when stuff like that happens. I didn’t even know she was back here!”\n\n“It wasn’t our decision,” I say.\n\nNormally the etiquette is for the manager who made the decision to move someone has to tell the shift leader that they’ve done it, but Jefe isn’t having it. He doesn’t want it done the established way. He wants the kitchen to inform him of all higher decisions made.\n\nOf course, Jefe doesn’t like that I’ve told him the truth of the situation. “It doesn’t matter if it was your decision. You guys have to communicate.”\n\nI’m clearly losing patience with Jefe, “But it wasn’t our decision. We shouldn’t have to tell you. It was up to the catering director to tell you.”\n\n“Just,” he pauses for a minute, lost for words. Clearly the truth confuses him. “Just communicate better,” he says.\n\n“So,” the decision for me is already made. I ask him: “ you want us to narrate what’s going on in the kitchen?”\n\n“If that means I know what’s going on, then yes,” he tells me. \n\nSo, that, of course, was the only permission I needed. Operation: Malicious Compliance is a “go”. I hope he was ready for it too. He got to get a full on, story book narration of today’s events in the kitchen. And, of course, I’ll be keeping this post updated with the results of my master plan in effect tomorrow, as well! ;)\n\nUpdate:\n\nI’m a day late, but I left Saturday with a sour taste in my mouth. I started the day off literally narrating everything the kitchen was doing. I even read a few of my old Dr. Seuss books to get a good feel for how I should be doing it. \n\nA few hours go by and I get pulled into the office to have a talk with the GM and Jefe. Jefe is standing in a corner with his arms crossed and has an upset look twisting up the features of his face. \n\nThe GM asks me what I was doing and I simply tell him what had happened on Friday. I had also told him the Jefe clearly said “if [narrating] means I know what’s going on, then yes [do that].”\n\nGM smiles, and tells me that it was very disrespectful and that I need to stop. Of course, I don’t want to escalate the situation to a point where I’d actually get into some kind of trouble with my superiors, so I tell them okay. I also made it clear that the next time Jefe refuses to listen to us (the kitchen) when we’re telling him something important that I will go to the GM with a formal complaint. In response to this, the GM tells Jefe that he thinks that’s fair and asks Jefe to wait in the office after I leave. \n\nThe day goes by with Jefe looking more upset than he did when the shift started. Mr. GM tells me after I punch out that he told Jefe “whatever problems you’re bringing into work with you need to be left at the door.” Apparently Jefe has been in a horrible state for the last week or so, and he’s been complained about a lot. \n\nSo if anything is to be taken out of this: when you do comply with malicious intent and it’s at the right moment you win. Not only with your GM but with the emotional payoff you get from pissing someone off by being as literal as possible. All in all, I had a good time and I’m glad you guys have enjoyed it!",

A pair of guys in their mid-20s had been sitting at the bar for about an hour and were a few beers in. I will call the two guys 'A' and 'B'. 'Me' is me, of course.\n\nThey flag me down.\n\nA: We'd each like a Kamikaze.\n\nMe: Sure thing! Coming right up.\n\nFor those of you that don't know, a Kamikaze is a shooter and a shooter is just a mixed drink with no ice, so that you can down them quickly. I proceed to mix both shooters in the same shaker, split the mix into two glasses, and place one in front of each of guy.\n\nB: \\*Points at A's glass\\* Hey, he has more than me!\n\nThese guys were happy drunk and it was said in a playful manner, so I knew I could get away with some malicious compliance. I take both glasses back, set them on the edge of bar nearest to me, and stoop down. I very dramatically scrutinize the glasses. It turns out that 'B' was indeed correct. I had poured slightly more of the shooter into A's glass.\n\nMe: You're absolutely right.\n\nI pick up A's glass and make it look like I'm about to pour some into B's glass. Here's where the malicious compliance comes in. Instead, I pour a little out of A's glass into the trough at the edge of the bar, then quickly put their glasses back in front of them.\n\nMe: Now he doesn't.\n\nThey both burst out laughing. I ended up getting a great tip from them at the end of the night.\n\nIt's funny what you can get away with when you control the flow of alcohol.",

She was very outgoing and liked to joke with us.\n\nShe kept a glass jar of candy on her desk, and we helped ourselves as we chatted with her.  One day, I walked up and took the last piece of candy.  \"Hey\", she said in mock anger, \"What are you doing, taking all my candy!  You'd better be planning on replacing it!\"  I laughed. \"Sure will.  But we warned you if you kept food at your desk, it would attract pests!\"\n\nThat night, I had an errand and saw a candy store.

There were warnings on the bag, but not on the individual pieces.  I bought enough to fill the jar.\n\nAfter the next few weeks, it was common to go into a meeting and see a normally staid engineer with a purple tongue or a green smile.

Every Friday, a couple of us would do a 'big shop' for the week at the supermarket on the way home - usually for much the same list.\n\nAt the cheese counter the regular order was for a pound of a variety that had to be cut by hand. The assistant got the big block and cut a piece, saying \"that's just over a pound and a half - is that okay?\". Being British, we said fine, and carried on.\n\nThe next week it was a different assistant. \"That's about a pound and a half - alright?\". Hmm. I guess.\n\nYou've guessed it. The next week, the same. But this time, I said no. \"Can you make it a pound please\". So the assistant took it back, cut a slice off, and weighed it again. \"That's about a pound and a quarter now - is that okay?\".  \"No - please cut it down to one pound\". This time it came back almost exactly correct.\n\nRegardless of the assistant, this pattern repeated for most of the year we shared that house. EVENTUALLY they got to recognise us, and from then on always gave us the pound we'd asked for first time. As I'd guessed, if you work on a cheese counter, you quickly get good at assessing quantities if you want to. But in the interim it gave us huge pleasure to play this weekly game, knowing they'd be left with awkward little slices of off-cut, while hopefully getting through to the manager who thought over-selling a great scam that it was in fact noticed and could backfire.",

        "text": "If you read my “Round 1” war story you'll know that I was on the Homestead AFB Housing Office’s shit list… probably at the very top of it.  So a couple of years later I'm now the Superintendent of Wing Inspections (I.G. Office) and no longer running the F-16 Integrated Avionics Branch. (That was just for you u/Action_Packed_Mental.). Nowadays I'm setting up and running Wing level disaster and preparedness exercises, investigating I.G. complaints, and best of all… rubbing elbows with all the higher ups in the Wing… like the Wing Commander, Base Commander, all the Squadron Commanders, etc..\n\n Well… after leaving the U.K. in 1987 where I flew gliders on the weekends with an RAF Glider Club at an RAF base I was looking for another outdoorsy hobby. No gliders in the Miami area at that time but I did find a small sailboat on the base Lemon Lot. It was a 13ft AMF Force 5 [(Example)](https://my2fish.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/force5.jpg) that needed some TLC but was fixable. I bought it and turned it upside down on a couple of sawhorses under my quarter’s carport where I patched a hole and painted it and got it all “ship-shape” (Hahahahaha, I kill me).  While doing this, I was reading a basic “How to sail” book as I'd never sailed anything before.\n\nOnce the boat was ready for the water I took it to the rectangular base lake, a couple of blocks up the street we lived on. The Base lake was maybe 200 yards long and 100 yards wide and there I worked each evening and weekend getting the basics down. Once I was confident I knew what I was doing it was off to Biscayne Bay. The daughter and I had loads of fun with it. It was small enough to rig and launch right off the beach within five or ten minutes of arrival. \n\nAfter a year or so… boys being boys… I figured “I can sail this potato chip of a small sailboat… therefore I must need a bigger boat.”  I found a Compac 16  [(Example)](http://photos.mostsailboats.org/1981/c/1981-Com-Pac-16_5104_3.jpg)  again, on the base Lemon Lot, after a few weeks.  So now… at my base quarters (the one with no plants or shrubs)... I had two sailboats on trailers. The larger Compac 16 under my carport and the smaller Force 5 (which I'm preparing to sell) sitting behind my house… not visible from the street.\n\nSooooo…. enter Mrs. S, the base housing officer I burned earlier with my obeying her order to trim my plants and shrubs. I get a notice, signed by her, ordering me to remove one of my sailboats from my base house because regulations say that only one trailered item (utility trailer, boat, camper, etc) can be “stored” at a base quarters at any given time and whenever it is there and “stored” (not being actively used) it must fit under the carport when parked and not out in the driveway.\n\nHmmmmm… I'm an E-8 in the I.G’s office with readily available access to all of the Wing and Base regulations. So, I start researching the base regulation referenced in her notification just to make sure Mrs. S has her shit together… always looking for a loophole to trap her in.   I find it.  Her base housing regulation does indeed talk about boats, trailers, campers that are kept at a resident’s home… but nowhere does it mention a maximum number you can “store” there.  It only requires that any trailered item, stored at a base house, must fit under the carport. Being the industrious guy that I am… I manhandled my larger and heavier Compac 16 sailboat and maneuvered it to the far side of my carport… still fully under said carport. That left me just enough room to position my Force 5 sailboat, on its trailer, beside it and itself, fully under the carport.  I did not reply to Mrs. S’s “ticket” as she said she would reinspect in a couple of days.\n\nWell… a few days later there was her new “ticket” on my front door. A “ticket” for having two sailboats on trailers under my carport and ordering me to get rid of one of them. I did nothing, I said nothing. After at least two more “tickets” over the next week or three with demands and threats (which I never responded to) I got a call from the Base Commander, asking me to come next door and see him. By this time the two of us were quite familiar with each other, in a professional context, due to all the meeting we attended together, planning exercises, inspections and the like. I told him I'd be right there.\n\nOn my way over I swung by admin and picked up the Wing’s copy of the Base Housing regulation and once in the man’s office I explained the whole situation and showed him “his own” base housing regulation and the exact wording that I was complying with. It was all a good natured meeting and we both giggled about the Base Housing office’s penchant to be a little anal at times… especially concerning their longest serving civilian inspector, Mrs. S.  He finally called the Base Housing office and talked to its director… with me right there in his office with him. He told him/her that he'd reviewed their complaint about SMSgt GeneHil’s sailboats and according to their own directives, SMSgt Genehil was in compliance by having both his sailboats fully under his carport when not actually being used or worked on.  He told them that if they wanted to amend their own base housing rules, to do so through the appropriate channels but in the meantime, leave SMSgt GeneHil’s sailboats alone.\n\nI decided to put off moving my Force 5 sailboat to the base Lemon Lot and try to sell it… just to irritate Mrs. S. It was another three or four months before I did so.  Good times!!!\n\nWhen I finally did retire and move out of base housing, Mrs. S was the inspector who showed up for a pre-inspection walk through of my quarters… I could tell she finally had me in a corner where she could exact her revenge.   Hahahaha… I made sure I did my homework and contracted with a Base Housing approved cleaning contractor who had a 100% pass rate. My move out of base housing passed with flying colors. \n\nGoodbye Mrs. S… it's been a hoot!",

        "text": "I was advised that maybe this belongs here too...\n\nWhen I arrived at Homestead AFB in early 1987 I was assigned a base house on Florida Avenue. Back then the USAF had its primary Conference Center at Homestead and Florida Avenue was the primary route through base housing to the conference center.  There were many different high level functions at the conference center throughout the year and residents of base housing along Florida Avenue were expected to keep their quarters and yard to a slightly higher standard than other areas of base housing.\n\nWhenever an important conference or function was scheduled for the conference center, the housing office would post a note to each and every Florida Avenue house a few days before the VIP arrivals, advising us to get our shit together, tidy up our yards, get the kids bikes and trikes out of sight, move the kiddie pools from the front yard to the back yard, cut the grass, edge the sidewalks, etc., etc., etc..\n\nOnce the notices were posted, base housing would inspect, usually on a Monday, and notify anyone if they thought something might have been missed and needed a bit of additional attention. As a conscientious NCO I was pretty good at complying with the requirements… but one time a very VIP conference was upcoming and I took great pains to make sure my quarters were second to none. I mowed, I trimmed, I even checked out an edger from Civil Engineering and edged the holy shit out of my driveway, walkway and sidewalk. My quarters was absolutely magnificent after I spent half of friggin Saturday and a big chunk of Sunday getting her prepared.\n\nSo… I get home from running the F-16 Avionics Branch on Monday afternoon around 5:30 and there's a note on my front door. It was the housing office reinspection notice.  In the remarks area it just said (in red Sharpie and in all caps **“TRIM YOUR PLANTS AND SHRUBS!!! - REINSPECTION TOMORROW”**. Holy shit I was pissed off. Not a single word about how the rest of the placed looked… Not a “Good job, but your shrubs could use a little trim.”  Nothing but **“TRIM YOUR PLANTS AND SHRUBS!!! - REINSPECTION TOMORROW”** in bright red Sharpie.\n\nTrim my plants and shrubs?!? I'll trim my fucking plants and shrubs!!! I backed my pickup up to my main shrubbery area and proceeded to yank every friggin plant from my entryway area. They ALL came out. They completely filled up the bed of my 1987 Ford Ranger and off to the base dump they went. I returned to my quarters and started working on the shrubs along the front and side of the house. I was able to use a strap and my truck to completely yank about six or eight plants (that had probably been there for 15-20 years) out of the ground. There were two or three that wouldn't move so I drove to a friends house off base and borrowed his electric chain saw to cut those two right down at ground level.  \n\nAfter probably three or four trips to the base dump, a couple of more hours sweeping and bagging debris, blowing off my driveway, walkway and sidewalk and putting a bit of mulch on the 5’x5’ area by the front door where I “trimmed” my flowering plants, all in all the place was very presentable with its beautifully manicured lawn… it was just missing each and every plant, shrub and anything else that scores of residents who lived there before me had taken the time and effort to install. But Hey! My plants and shrubs were trimmed.\n\nThe shit hit the fan the next morning when the base housing office contacted my CRS Commander. Hell… my base quarters looked like it had been helicoptered in and dropped onto an empty lot during the night before… but otherwise it was very presentable in every way. The commander was amused and I stuck to my guns. There was nothing in the base housing rules that said I had to plant anything at my base quarters nor was I required to retain and maintain anything that previous residents had planted. It turned out to be Much Ado About Nothing… but I certainly made Base Housing’s shit list for two or three years afterwards.\n\nI retired a few years later and moved off base. I ran the Wing’s F-16 flight simulator for another three years after that and would occasionally drive down Florida Avenue just to see if any subsequent residents planted anything around that house.

        "text": "So i attended school in china from kindergarten to grade 4 prior to immigration ( I am 27 now). This took place in my third grade year.\n\nI was an slightly above average student and well liked by most teachers, but my home room teacher just did not like me. She adores kids who kissed up to her but I was raised by my parent's not to be like that. \n\nAlthough my grades were good I was always in trouble, for example after I'm done my in class work I would stare out a window or doodle or othewise showcase my boredom,I was once told that even if I'm done to still act like I'm working. This teacher also believed and exacted corporal punishment, mostly to me. And what angered her the most was the fact that I never apologized or begged for forgiveness when she would hit me.\n\nOne day I was in trouble for correcting her English pronunciation of a few words( my mom taught me English earlier on). So she had me stand in her office which was a big space she shared with all teachers of that grade. This is pretty standard punishment coming from her. After about 40 minutes I really had to pee, and I remember my mom  telling me not to hold pee for super long as it's bad for my bladder and kidneys. So I asked to go pee then come back to the punishment. The teacher refused but I insisted and explained that my mom who was a doctor had told me the harms of holding pee for too long. The other teachers snickered at my head teacher for this . My teacher got very embarrassed and angry and yelled at me.\n\n\" If it's so important for you not to hold your pee then just pee your pants right here! I don't believe you have to pee you just want out of your punishment.\"\n\nI looked her dead in the eyes and empties my entire bladder, there was enough pee to completely soak my shorts( really glad it was summer) and spread out in to a giant pool on their unsealed concrete floor which immediately absorbed most of my urine.\n\nApparently the faint odor of my urine was detectable for several years after. \n\n\n",

        "text": " I posted this in r/TalesFromYourServer and was forwarded here to share. Enjoy.\n\n**BG info**:\n\nThis happened 6 years ago at a friend's Thai/Chinese restaurant at the age of just finishing college but haven't found a job in our field of study yet phase. Friend and I work together part time at his dad's restaurant on the weekends when it's the most busiest and would be ram packed of customers and people waiting at the bar. As a small family restaurant, we don't have our own section, all staff attend to all tables.\n\nAs the son of the restaurant owner and busting his balls there on every weekend since the legal working age - he pretty much had the place down as his territory which meant he had the managerial power and responsibility to do a lot of things. Occasionally, we would have some fun and banter in the bar like treating deserving customers cocktails (cocktails weren't on the menu but we loved making them so a lot of the ingredients we bought personally to treat our customers) for special occasions like birthdays etc.\n\n**Story**:\n\n7pm hits and you can see a wave of reservations coming in. A party of 12 Indian/Asian family come in and we sit them down to their table. Throughout the night this table was giving all the waiting staff grief with the typical rude, demanding, pretentious I-own-you-attitude, \"this is what I ordered? I didn't mean that, I meant that\". They would ask one of us for something and ask another person for the same thing a minute later causing double orders. This table really made us run back and forth especially when a colleague would ask the whole table if they wanted more drinks with only 1 actually replying. When that 1 person gets their drink placed on their table then another 1 would ask for a drink - domino effect.\n\nI'm walking back into the kitchen with a buttload of dirty dishes after cleaning a table. I made the horrible mistake of making eye-contact with the mum whom without a single word fingers me over to her in a way that's blocking my path back into the kitchen. Now if you know Asians, a majority of them like their food with a kick of spice and a burn of hotness (I'm Asian and I love it too).\n\n&gt;\\*fingers me over and points to a small oily saucer\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mum: \"This chilli oil is not hot enough, go tell the chef to make it more spicy. And bring more out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*She finishes her sentence by placing the oily saucer on top of the stacked plates I'm already holding\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: \\[*Wtf?! You stopped me going back into the kitchen when you can clearly see I'm about to break my back with all these dishes and I have to clear this table for the next guests just for more chilli oil?!*\\] No problem ma'am, I'll speak to the chef and bring more out for the table.\n\nI signal to my mate that I've had enough of this table and to drop the bomb on them. As mentioned earlier, my mate loves a bit of banter and fun in the workplace - many weeks ago he had ordered online those ridiculously high Scoville rated \"why-would-anyone-eat-this\" kind of chilli sauces; I'm talking one tiny drop of this stuff will put your tongue in a fiery agonizing pain for the next 30 minutes kind of hot.\n\nWe go back into the kitchen and add our extra ingredient in with the chef's standard chilli oil like a pair of evil witches cackling whilst mixing their pots.\n\nWithin seconds after serving them our special sauce, they were panting with their tongues out like thirsty dogs whilst fanning their mouth.\n\nYep you got it right: we took our sweetass time getting them their water.\n\nTL;DR Revenge is a dish best served hot.\n\nEdit: We don't serve that hot sauce to any of our customers, it was bought for a challenge amongst the staff to see who could take it without needing milk relief the longest.",

        "text": "About a year ago, I was working on a website that stretched back about 7 to 8 years, filled with stereotypically trashy PHP code, \"TODO\"s, \"FIXME\"s and all the good stuff that comes with that. Since fixing and tidying up existing stuff doesn't bring extra cash, my team was tasked with working on monkey-patching yet another money grabbing feature.\n\nAs is usually the case, the client has sent us a specification as a shared Google Docs file, and we would mysteriously find other things added on overnight when they changed their mind about something - conveniently, that would almost always happen *after* we have finished coding that part. Coupled with bouncing back-and-forth over Slack on how something should work, having their QA return tickets to us because they have thought of \"just one more thing that would be cool\" and the project lasting several months with at least 7 different developers working on it, each with their own style, everyone was understandably stressed and it was up to me and two other guys to finish up the job.\n\nAfter yet another day of coding and debugging an obscure bug that was rooted in code which was written while I was in first grade of high school and guessing what the client wanted to say by this line in the specification, we finally deployed the presumably final version to the testing servers so that they can play with it and see if it's to their liking. \n\nKnock-knock-knock, my laptop happily chirped. The representative of the client sends me a Slack message.\n\n\"Hey, I am sorry to interrupt, but I've thought of a small thing that would be useful to all of us here.\"\n\nEye roll, deep sigh. \"What's the thing?\"\n\n\"Well, it would be useful to have a button for filtering this list in our admin interface. Just put a button labeled 'Filter' around here.\" Enclosed was a picture of said admin interface with a button crudely drawn in MS Paint, and circled for good measure - as if I could miss the thick red marking left by a brush tool that was abused into making what looked like a chewed-up box and a handwritten \"FILteR\" label.\n\nMy brain started revving up for another round of questions. What should this button filter? How should it filter? Should it be customisable, do you also need a drop-down list to pick *what* do you want to filter by? If I could read thoughts I wouldn't be working here, so why do I always have to guess what do you want?\n\nHuh. That last question hit home. Suddenly I knew exactly what to do, but I just had to confirm it.\n\n\"Uh, is that all? I should just put the button there?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\nNext morning, I woke up to a bug ticket titled \"The filter button doesn't do anything when clicked\". My boss and coworkers asked me about it and laughed when I told them the story, and said that, well, I *did* do what was asked of me. The client rep wasn't all that happy, but he was smart enough to understand what went wrong and ever since the communication was slowly improving to the point where, a few months down the line, we no longer had to guess what they meant most of the time.",

        "text": "One night, I was off work quite late, around 8:30pm in Vancouver.  I had not had dinner yet and as I drove, I saw a Subway restaurant and a Domino pizza that were still lit up so I decided to stop and order some supper.  I decided that I need to be eating healthier so I decided to go to the subway instead.I parked and started walking to the front door when I noticed that the an older lady is right in front of the door wiping the door glass as if she was preparing to close the store.\n\nMe: \"excuse me? but is the store still open?\".\n\nLady:  \\*giving the the evil eye\" ... \"What does it say on the door?\" pointing to the OPEN sign.Me: \"Uh...It's open?\" confused on the rude response...Lady: \"That's right it's open!  What kind of question is that?\" and she began to enter the store.  Till this day, I'm not sure who this lady was, based on her attitude, it looked like that she was the owner of the place or she was supposed to be the late shift worker for that subway restaurant.\n\nMe: As I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the lady keeps giving me such evil glare.  I thought to myself, what's going on?  What did I do?  Did I stink? Was I exuding some sort of evil aura to her? I decided that I was going to ignore this and started to order.  I ordered the Steak and Cheese Sandwiches with Italian Bread, a Sun Chip and a Diet Coke.  But as I was ordering she kept giving me this uncomfortable look.  Again I continued to ignore this as I still didn't understand what's happening.  She continued to stare at me from time to time as she prepared the food as if to make sure that I knew that she didn't like me, I continued to smile nervously, as I didn't know what's going on...\n\nUntil finally after nearing the time I had to pay, she finally said..\n\nLady: \"Do you know that I hate it when someone asked if the store is closed, when it's clearly open?\"\n\nMe: \"Um..? Excuse me?\n\nLady: \"Do you know that I really hate it when someone asked me if the store is closed when It's clearly open?\" (at this time she started to raise her voice).\n\nMe: \"Um I don't understand, ...you were standing in the front door, I thought you were closing the store, so I was asking if the store was still open... I'm sorry if I offend..... \\*before I even finished\n\nLady: \"IF THE OPEN SIGN IS STILL LIT THEN THE STORE IS OPEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK IF THE STORE IS OPEN, WHAT KIND OF STUPID QUESTION IS THAT?  I REALLY HATE IT AND I DON'T WANT TO SERVE IDIOTS LIKE YOU. \\*I Kid you not, at this time she was practically yelling at me.\n\nME: At this time I was really tired, hungry and really didn't appreciate being yelled at.  So I looked at her for 10 seconds, smiled and said, \"I see.. OK then, good bye\"  I left the subway with her just standing with my sandwich and Diet Coke, went to Domino store right beside it, ordered a Philly Steak Pizza and a Coke, made sure that she saw me with the Pizza waved at her, got into the car and drove away... and from that day on, I will never ever choose a Subway over a Domino...\n\nUntil the next story about KFC...\n\n\\*new addition- The store has been under new management, apparently upon further review, I am not the only one who experienced this crazy encounter with the apparent owner...\n\n[https://www.yelp.ca/biz\\_photos/subway-vancouver-5?select=lB2ArIAvy1P6095TUR3iAQ](https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/subway-vancouver-5?select=lB2ArIAvy1P6095TUR3iAQ)",

        "text": "This happened today actually. I just started college and my store manager was made aware when I started that I would have to work around school (which is now Tus and Thurs with weekend tutoring)\nDue to life (and the resume that got me the job), I missed a lot of schools and need additional tutoring to catch up and fast. This is my dream and I talk about it more than anything else with everyone at work. \n\nAs some background on the store manager, she chewed me a new one once before because she asked if I would work a friday shift, I said I might but let me check my schedule. It turned out that would have made it an 8 day week for me with one day off and another long week so I said no. She went off on me about how I was a terrible person and a lazy worker and the job is give and take and I'm not being flexible and it's only a 38 hour week (they taper schedules so no one get's close to overtime when the week rolls over but everyone works odd, long hours) and she only looked at the current week's total.\n\nI explained my schedule to my department manager and she was fine with me working M-W-F during school as I've been working weekends and any random day (changes every week) since I started almost 8 months ago now. so I was surprised to see my schedule changed to work Sunday.\n\nI spoke to the store manager and she said she had changed it and \"I won't lose good workers because It isn't fair to the other employee's that you don't work weekends\" As if me not working weekends in my department would matter to anyone as my co-workers don't mind the weekend shifts at all (they enjoy weekdays off) and it was entirely fine. \nI reminded her that when I started I told her that my schedule would have to work around school and she said \"that's perfectly fine\"\nShe replied that she had said \"I would have to work some weekends\"\nI've worked every weekend for 8 months. \n\nShe went on to say I -had- to work weekends or find a different job.\n\nSo I cleaned up, closed and left two hours early after turning in my name tags and hat with a flat \"I quit\" to the manager on duty surprising the heck out of her. While parading around the store with my green hair. (against policy)\n\nSo now they are down one of their three fully trained workers, the other is in school taking 5 courses this semester and the third is already full time. we've had several new hires since I started and they all quit, transferred or just can't do the job. The manager in my department recently changed as well to someone new at managing and I was one of the few workers to catch praise from the store inspector that comes in every few weeks. \nNot to mention I was the only one cross-trained in another department that was understaffed and frequently needed my help on short notice.\n\nI'll be looking into working at the school tomorrow. \n\n",

        "text": "Note: The story is sad and I have sympathy for the victims but I don't feel like a bad guy. Two layers of compliance.\n\nYears ago I lived in a very Hispanic neighborhood (vaguely relevant information) with a lot of young children. They were very loud and screamed constantly during all hours of the day and night. Not just giggle playing screams but blood curdling horror screams.\n\nAll. The. Time.\n\nOne day I get a knock at my door and see two blue shirt police officers; white guy and Hispanic woman. They ask me if I've seen anything strange, creepers, uncomfortable situations, etc. Things have been pretty normal and say as much. They proceed to tell me that a little girl is missing and if I had heard a scream or struggle. I let them know that the children scream everyday and constantly, so I wouldn't have paid attention to any particular scream.\n\nThat's when the Hispanic officer lost it. She got IN my face about racist white males ignoring the plight of Hispanics, not caring about the neighborhood and community and for not calling the police when I heard a child scream.\n\nSo I agreed to dial 911 at every child scream from that point on.\n\nWithin three days I had to called 911 at least 15 times. Each time I explained it was relevant to case #XXXX with officer (Hispanic lady) that I should report a child screaming in the neighborhood.\n\nEventually I got a call from a superior officer about abusing 911. I agreed and was told to contact Hispanic officer directly with any other information regarding the investigation.\n\nMalicious compliance level II. \n\nNow I was authorized to call Hispanic officer directly, day or night, when I had information regarding the investigation.\n\nAnd I did. Every scream, she got a phone call. 2 in the morning and kids are screaming? Guess who else gets to wake up?! Morning officer Hispanic lady!\n\nShe tries to get me in trouble for harassing her but I had a nice trail of documentation with 911 and her own supervisor to always keep her informed of screaming children.\n\nTo help everyone feel a little better, the little girl was kidnapped by her uncle and found safely in another state. \n\nSome edits to help. I didn't read 800+ comments but I'll try to give some more information over all.\n\n-MC level I ended after the first weekend and MC level II ended by the second week.\n\n-More than once (witness car accidents, questions about domestic violence) I've been given direct contact information by officers. Though in this case I was given the business contact by the other officer.\n\n-The white male partner during the initial encounter did nothing. I could only tell he was alive because he blinked. He was a non issue.\n\n-I probably was too casual about dismissing children screaming, but it was the officer who decided I was ignoring 911 worthy phone call situations. Quit your bitching.\n\n-Duh, it's malicious compliance so someone will call fake. I'm not telling a boring everyday story but a once in a lifetime one off. That's the interesting part.\n\nEdit #2 and hopefully last addition.\n\nThis was as much a CYA(cover your ass) as it was Malicious Compliance. I wanted to make sure everyone knew I wasn't indifferent to my neighbors or trouble in the neighborhood.",

        "text": "So this happened several days ago. I'm a college student who worked at McDonalds for the past summer. I've met my fair share of rude customers but this one really stood out. \n\nShe bought an ice cream cone which totaled to 1.51. I announced the total and saw she took out a little coin purse, presumably to count out change. When this happens, I basically go and make the cone so when I'm back, they have the money ready and I can just hand the cone. \n\nHowever, this woman decided to count out individual pennies to pay the total. She very clearly had multiple quarters but chose to pay it as a quarter and 26 pennies. In addition, she placed them on the counter rather than keeping it in her hand which meant I'd have to pick them off the counter which is super annoying. Luckily, there were no other customers at the time but this was obviously very infuriating to me  as but I kept my cool.\n\nBy the time she finally counted out her coins (and she sure took her sweet time), the cone was starting to droop a bit, but not in any way that it would melt soon. However, upon looking at it, she was incredibly angry and demanded she get a new one as I \"had no idea what I was doing\" and to give our valued customers a cone that was satisfactory, I called my manager over to make it so it was up to standard.\n\nafter my manager made the cone, I gave her some napkins which is custom, and she demanded for more as in \"Give me more, how can you think this is enough?\" I continuously gave her more until she was finally satisfied and the amount I gave her in the end was the amount we'd give to 8 customers (probably).\n\nHowever, these napkins weren't good enough for her. after getting the napkins, she leafed through 5 at a time, and kept getting increasingly angry about the state of them. They had tiny water drops, in a concentrated area and were extremely small and were probably a result of my hand being slightly wet from washing it prior to taking her order. They were definitely fine as the drops were extremely extremely small and if she didn't look at it closely, she definitely wouldn't have seen it. \n\nWhen she demanded for clean napkins, I told her they were basically all like that and she angrily yelled \"NO! THAT'S NOT HOW THEY ARE!! I WANT CLEAN NAPKINS! HOW HARD CAN THIS BE?\" Of course, I could've just told her to go fuck herself but being the petty person I am, I simply smiled and said \"Of course ma'am, allow us to open a new bag JUST for you!\"\n\nSo I slowly went to the area where we kept our napkins and took out a stack of them and went back to her and opened it in front of her. I then proceeded to take out 5-6 at a time and carefully inspected them to make sure they were up to par. When I placed it on the counter, I made sure it was out of reach for her to grab. As I kept doing this, you could see her get more and more visibly upset and after a few seconds of doing this, she just yelled \"CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME MY DAMN NAPKINS\" to which I replied \"Oh of course ma'am! I just wanted to ensure they were up to par as the previous set of napkins were clearly unsatisfactory!\" \n\nAs I handed her the napkins, she yelled \"You're obnoxious and rude, and I'll make sure you get fired\" to which I replied \"I'm sorry you feel that way ma'am, but have a great day!\" and smiled in her snarling face.\n\nTL;DR If you want shit, be nice\n\nIn hindsight, I really should've just said \"There's a grocery store across the street, knock yourself out\"",

I figured the longer I could last, day by day, the more money I'd get out of it, and that's exactly what I did.\nI ended up having to work about 30 minutes off the clock daily, as well as once being required to come in 3 hours before I could clock in. They also came up with some crazy story on how they found cocaine in the bathroom and it was definitely absolutely mine. They then spread this story outside of work, affecting my personal life, and threatening a custody case of a guy I was once involved with. On top of all this, I was given a massive cleaning load after the cook left, to be done entirely by myself. Shutting the bar down, packaging leftover food, cleaning the friers, the floors, so on and so forth, being harassed the entire time about how long it took me to complete.\nWell, yesterday (Monday), I was having a neck spasm, was emotionally exhausted, and incredibly fatigued. I tried to call in to be a few hours late, but was told the other girl had to leave for a while. So I went in, in tears, and did my very best. I was told I could leave soon, when the other girl returned, which never happened. Several hours in, I could not handle it any longer. I wanted nothing more than to go home and lay down. I was informed that I could leave, but I must bring back a doctor's note, or I would lose my job. Hey.... Why not both?\n\nSo I went to the urgent care clinic, discussed the spasm, got the note, and finally went home to lay down. Today, I called fifteen minutes before my shift, informed them I had the note they requested, and that I would be unable to continue working with them.\nTomorrow morning, I will go pick up my check, and return my uniform shirts. I will be accompanied by one of my town's most personable police officers, so we can discuss the whole cocaine matter. Shut that lie down. Go stay in the mountains for a few weeks with an amazing man. \n\nThere are aspects of this job I will in fact miss, but oh well. Here's your doctor's note. Bye. ",

        "text": "Background info 1: I work at a gaming company as a translator, but I also respond to support tickets when there are no translation work to do.\n\nBackground info 2: My supervisor doesn’t really like it when we spend too much time supporting F2P  players (Free to Play: Players who do not spend any money). He won’t go out of his way to stop us, but he’d rather have us work on paying users’ issues before we get to the F2P user tickets. \n\nResponding to customers is not my primary job, my soul hasn’t been sucked out of me and I still had much faith in our user base and humanity as a whole. However, earlier this week, I was working on a support ticket that may have gotten on my nerves a bit.\n\nI was working on a support ticket that should have been simple, but it was giving me some trouble because none of the typical solutions seemed to work. After struggling for a good 30 minutes on it, I asked my supervisor for help. He noticed that the user was a F2P player and promptly told me to just send it over to the developers to handle. Moving a ticket to developers would usually mean that it’ll take at least a few days before it gets resolved since they have other work to do. I didn’t want to leave one of our players to twiddling their thumbs unable to play our game for few days.  So I decided to go through a temporary fix that’d let the user play the game while a solution was being worked on. \n\nHowever, it all kind of fell apart when I received another message from the user. He made it abundantly clear that he was annoyed at my “incompetence” and that our company better start preparing some sort of monetary compensation for his “lost time”. While I appreciate our users for enjoying the game and supporting the company I work for, there is no reason for me to be taking this sort of attitude. Especially when I was doing them a favor trying to help them out!\n\nBut being in the service industry, you can’t really say what you want. So I apologized for the delay and explained that we’ll be using a workaround solution that’ll let him continue playing the game while a solution is worked on. To which he replied “Thanks for wasting my time, but I want someone more competent helping me out.”\n\nWell, if you insist! I sent the ticket to the developer without helping the player get the temporary fix. Developers are currently finishing off one of the bigger projects that they’ve been working on. They haven’t worked on any of the recent support tickets they received. The more competent people will work on your problem in about a week, hope you enjoy the long wait.",

So I lock eyes with her and list literally every sauce we have, down to the jam for morning biscuits. My voice rose as I finished as my customers passenger totally lost it in the background. They made their choice(BBQ!), and crept towards my window. Listing literally every sauce is a bit much, as we assume it's implied we have standard ketchup, mayo, mustard packets.

This is an event that advertises many services for new families and babies (think doula, photographer, homemade items, dentists, etc.). One if the best parts of these events is the free stuff and goodies for visiting different booths. One booth had cookies and lemonade, one had coupons, one had toothbrushes, you get the point. \n\nI was soooo hungry when we left (like always, unless I was throwing up). I excitedly tore into my goodie bag and ate a cookie and some candy. I had eaten most of the good stuff and was inspecting a small block of handmade (brown) soap that I had been given. My husband, who had kind of been an ass all day, starts fussing at me for not sharing and insists that I give him the brownie. I tell him there is no brownie and he tells me I'm a liar that he sees it in my hand. He keeps on and on and is just being a jerk about me not sharing like he thinks I should. \n\nSo, like the sweet wife I am, I take the wrapper off the brownie and hand it to him. I tell him to enjoy his brownie with high hopes of him taking a big, greedy bite. He fusses at me more for not sharing and then the stars align and he takes a huge bite. I mean his teeth were grinding all up in that soap. Cue evil laughter. \n\nHe was invested in that brownie and it took him longer than expected to realize that he had soap all in his mouth. It was amazing. Hopefully he remembers to never try and mess with a pregnant lady's snacks :) ",

This store had a mezzanine all along the edge of the store to display different large items for purchase- usually pool tables, tents, etc. Basically think of it like a balcony only indoors and without a guard rail.\n\nWe had just gotten a new GM, known henceforth as ratface. Ratface came from a smaller, lower traffic store. Ratface wanted a promotion, and was an utter asshole to work for. \n\nThe day our district manager was set to show up for an inspection, ratface decided the store needed a change. He wanted three of us (myself included) to drop what we were doing, and move all of the basketball goals to the mezzanine before the DM showed up for her inspection. We explained that:\n\n1. None of the goals can be moved in one piece.\n2. The larger goals are too heavy to be moved.\n3. The in-ground goals (which were the heaviest) would be impossible to move up there due to the elevator not being tall enough, and the stairwell too narrow.\n4. Even if we started yesterday, the amount of work is too much to complete in such a short time frame with only 3 people.\n\nRatface gave no fucks. His exact words: \"I don't care ***how*** you do it. I just want you to fucking do it.\"\n\nMessage recieved, loud and clear. We set out to detach the bases from the portable goals, and while the water drained from the bases we detached the backboards. With the portables broken down into three pieces we could just barely fit them into the lift, and the easiest part of the job was done- though it was also very time consuming. The hard part would be getting the large, heavy in-ground goals up there. We removed the backboard off of one them- which weighed about 150 lbs- and we started thinking of how to get the pole up where ratface wanted it. The pole, by the way, took two of us to get off of the bolts. The thing had to have weighed at least 500 lbs, and was unwieldy as fuck.\n\nThe only thing we could think of doing was using rope to haul it up using the trusses on the ceiling. The idea seemed super dangerous, for the store, the customers, and us employees so we approached ratface one more time to give him a chance to reconsider. He did not.\n\nWe got the pole about halfway up when the DM came in, saw us, and immediately started screaming at us to stop. We lowered the pole back down to earth, tearing a decent sized gouge into the wall in the process. Rateface heard the commotion and came running out of his office. He wasted no time in throwing us under the bus. \"What are you guys doing? Jesus Christ! I just asked you guys to spruce the place up a bit for the inspection! Why would you do this?\"\n\nAll three of us looked at each other while saying in unison, \"Because you asked us to.\" and the head of the bike department added, \"Yeah, and I believe your exact words were ' I don't care how you do it. I just want you to do it.\"\n\nRatface went to interject, but the DM cut him off. She asked ratface, with the rage of a thousand soccer moms, \"Are you a liar, or are you incompetent? Do you ***honestly*** expect me to believe you had ***no idea*** this was happening? This work had to have taken at least 3 hours. Are you saying that you didn't walk the store for at least the last three hours today?\"\n\nRatface sheepishly replied, \"Well, no, I walked the stor-\"\n\n\"So you're a liar then, and to make matters worse, you're trying to pass the buck onto employees who I know for a fact would never do anything like this unless they were told to. Now, I want everything put back the way it was yesterday.\"\n\nRatface told us to start putting everything back, but our heaven-sent DM had other plans. \"Nu-uh. You made this mess. You clean it up. I don't care if you have to stay past midnight tonight. These young men are going to finish their shifts and go home on time. I'm coming back tomorrow, and if it those goals aren't back exactly where they should be so help me god.\"\n\nTo this day I have never seen a man more defeated than ratface was in that moment. In the end we had to move everything back since ratface was a tall, lanky skeleton of a man, but the DM did see fit to order lunch for us which was cool. Not nearly as cool as watching her rip his soul out right in front of us, though.",

        "text": "So my Dad took a trip down memory lane and told me a great story of MC. This man lives for situations like this.\n\nIn the mid-1990s he worked for a government sponsored housing program. This was his first desk job after working construction for his whole life. Upon arrival, he received his government-issued computer, cell phone, chair, pens, notepads, ect.\n\nAfter about a year or so, his specific program was ending and everyone was informed they were going to be laid off. Shortly after that notice, the office manager split before everyone else's last day. The office manager was the only authorized person to sign-in equipment previously issued to employees. Knowing this, my Dads half paranoid, half smug self took advantage of a MC opportunity.\n\nSince the office manager already left, there is no one available to sign for the equipment he is responsible for. Whether it's living in constant fear or wanting to minimize his risks, he didn't want something happening to his stuff if it was still in the building after it was shut down. Therefore on the second to last day, my Dad arrives with a hand truck in tow and a f-you smirk on his face. As he starts making a scene while loading his massive 1995 computer monitor and tower on his cart, the IT manager stops by his desk to give him a hard time saying he can't take anything with him. My dad simply explained that since everything is still under his name, the government entity can give him a call when someone can sign for his stuff. Frustrated, the IT manager goes back into his office and makes a few phone calls. An hour later he stops by my Dads now packed up desk and tells him upper management gave him permission to sign for it. Satisfied, he unloads his stuff as coworkers wait in line to check in theirs as well.",

        "text": "I didn't really think I had a good MC story, until I just read one about a retail customer wanting her receipt corrected to get her full discount...and then ended up paying more.\n\nMine takes place back in 2008.  It was my second day working at  a title company, a job that was completely new to me.  It didn't take any unusual smarts to do this job, but since I was new, some things were still a little confusing.  Some of you might remember that at this time the housing market was in a very bad place.  In order to spark people's faith in purchasing homes, we had the first time homebuyer tax credit.  Essentially you got a tax credit for 10% of your purchase price, up to $7,500, that acted like a no interest loan.  So, you needed to purchase a $75,000 home in order to receive the full $7,500 tax credit.  This might not seem like much, but at the time banks had a surplus of foreclosed homes, and in our area it was not uncommon to see houses going for $50,000 that were $200,000 just a few years prior.\n\nOn to the MC.  It's day two of my job, and a customer calls in after going over her closing documents.  She wants to know why she's not getting the full $7,500 tax credit.  I look it over and let her know that it's because her sales price is only $62,000 (estimating this number, it was 10 years ago), so she is only entitled to $6,200.  Oh, but she's demanding to get the full amount, and she knows that her agent and us are just trying to screw her out of the remainder!  This is a one time credit, and she doesn't want to miss out on a dime.  In all honesty she wasn't really that hard to deal with over the phone, from what I can remember, but she also wasn't going to let this go without getting the full credit.\n\nI, being new, am not really sure what to do, and I'm also thinking that maybe I'm missing something here.  So, I go get a more experienced processor to assist.  I run the scenario by her and ask if I'm missing something.  She assures me that I have the information correct.  She talks to the customer on the phone for a few minutes...the conversation is amicable, and after she hangs up she informs me that the we have to contact the agents, because the buyer wants to increase her sales price from $62,000 to $75,000 in order to recieve the full tax credt.  I did that, and never heard from the buyer again.  She was happy, and the bank that owned the property was happy to make an easy $13,000.\n\nTL:DR  First time home buyer calls up and agrees to pay $13,000 extra on her house in order to get $1,300 extra on a tax credit that needs to be paid back.",

        "text": "I used to work retail back in the 80's.  We didn't have credit card readers or barcode readers, and the items on sale didn't automatically post the discount.  I had to enter *all* of that by hand.    If something was on sale, I had to enter the sku, the quantity, hit the discount key, enter a 1 for % off or 2 for $ off, the price, and finally the $ 05 % off.  (It may not have been that order, exactly, but I did have to key all that in.)  The keypads were a little sticky, and I really wasn't the best a keypunching.  Occasionally, the system would skip an \"enter\" and charge the customer $0.01 or $0.02 for something.  And, if you made a mistake while the customer was still there, you were supposed to void the entire sale and rering it from scratch.\n\nSo, it's one of *those* days.  This woman comes up with about 10 things.  Fine.  I ring her up.  She takes her receipt and studies it.  Then she throws it back at me and says \"You didn't give me my 15%.  Fix this.\"  \n\nShe was right.  I had missed a discount on one of her items.  What *also* happened was that I charge her $0.02 for a $50 sweater.  Her discount was less than $10.  \n\nSo, I voided the sale and started over.  This time I got everything right.  She flipped.  I just kept saying \"Yes, I fixed all of my mistakes.\"  There wasn't anything management could do because, yes, the receipt was now entirely correct.  \n\nI hate retail.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Computer Science was a new field in my high school in 1989, and it was taught by a math teacher (we'll call her Mrs. H) who either lost a bet or agreed to a small pay bump; meaning, she wasn't the most knowledgeable teacher. I, on the other hand, had been kicking ass in Wizardry and Hard Hat Mack on my Apple IIe since 1983.\n\nI was smart, a total teacher's pet and most teachers loved me. But there was something about the combination of this teacher and me that was a disaster. Maybe it was because I had discovered how to use the chat function on our tiny networked lab (much hilarity ensued), or perhaps Mrs. H just didn't like the idea of a sophomore who might know more about programming than she picked up at her four hours of professional development. Or maybe I was too much of a wise ass in her class? Yeah, that was probably it.\n\nAnyway, to the Malicious Compliance. We took a test one day and I thought I had done pretty well, despite one of the questions being kind of unusual - I thought it was some sort of trap Mrs. H had put on the test. I was surprised when the tests were returned and the tricky question had been marked wrong.\n\nAs we usually did, we went over the test together as a class. When the unusual question came up, Mrs. H gave me a look and said, \"Well *almost* everyone got this right, so we can skip it.\" I raised my hand and protested, \"Mrs. H, I'm pretty sure I got this one right and you marked it wrong.\" She glared at me. Intimidated, I mumbled, \"I'll just come talk to you after class.\"\n\nShe jumped all over me. \"Oh no - I think we'll go over this one **right now**! Come on up to the board and show everyone why they're wrong and you're right!\"\n\nSo I went up to the board. This \"unusual\" question was lines of code where we were asked to write down the output. At first glance, and because it was so similar to a program we had worked through many times in class, it looked like the output should have been \"1, 2, 3, 4, ... 10.\" But if you actually traced the program, you could see that the output was \"1, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...10\". \\[Full disclosure - it might not have been *exactly* that, but something like that.\\]\n\nI traced the steps on the board, working the class through each line of code, and at the end turned to see Mrs. H with her face in a twisted rage. I sat back down in my seat and kept my head down through the rest of the test review.\n\nWhen the bell rang, Mrs. H accosted me at the front of the room and said, \"*Next* time, you should see me in *private* if you have a problem!\"\n\nSummoning all of my 16 year old courage, I snarled, \"I gave you your chance.\" Mouse drop.",
