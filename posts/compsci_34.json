        "text": "Good day guys!\n\nForest gardening or food forests is a system of gardening that incorporates different\ntrees and plants that produce yields which can be eaten or can be used by humans.\nMost plants in the forest garden are multipurpose and is aimed to be perennial\nwhich allows the forest to be highly sustainable. To improve ecosystem health,\ndiversity is also important. Different species of plants give mutual benefit to each\nother which allows the plants to take care of themselves (Crawford, M. (2014). Creating a forest garden: working with nature to grow edible\ncrops. Green Books.)\n\nSome plants, however, would be fighting each other rather than having them beneficial towards each other.\n\nSo far, I know that I need to create an Ecological Model of Food Forests to allow gardeners to realize the possible yield they will have and the sustainability of the food forest.\n\nCreating an ecological model would require an algorithm, I thought of genetic algorithm which would choose the best characteristics of the current generated plot and just keep improving it. \n\nI just need your inputs as well on different algorithms! Thank you!",

They can be modified with sliders.\n\nBasically, I generate a random generation, cross the parents, mutate the offspring, and select the 10 best out of 30 randomly chosen offsprings. I would expect the GA to yield a solution at most 5% longer than the best one in about 100 generations (sounds reasonnable to me), but the results I get are much worse than that.\nI'm wondering if there's something wrong with the algorithm itself (can't figure out what), or if it's a more suttle bug (websockets that I use for triggering a new generation?).\n\nI uploaded a demo of the project here: http://mintoo.pythonanywhere.com\nThe genetic algorithm is deactivated because it relies on websockets, which the hosting platform does not support.\n\nAs for the other algorithms, I think they're fine but again, any feedback appreciated !",

I also understand that the cyclomatic complexity of a graph represents the different linear paths through a given graph. Even with understanding these I am having some difficulty with representing for loops. My current understanding is that if a for loop will execute a variable number of times then the ending node for the loop will point back to the first node, and the first node of the loop will branch to some second node. This has a complexity of two because there are two possible paths. With that being said, how would you represent a for loop that is going to execute a pre-determined number of times? For example, a for loop that will always execute five times regardless of change in variables will only have one possible path and therefore should have a cyclomatic complexity of 1. Would you not draw the aforementioned for loop as feeding from the last node of the loop back to the first therefore allowing for a complexity of 1 instead of 2?\n\nI have attempted to read the textbook provided and look for the answer online, but this specific case is stumping me. In my head there is a sort of contradiction in trying to draw the graph to match the execution of the program, but also wanting to represent the correct number of paths.",

        "text": "Hey, I've been poking around with minimisation algorithms on acyclic automata and I noticed that a some of my patterns are quite sparse. What I mean by sparse is basically a pattern like \"...a...b\" where the wildcards are pretty much just filler in order to make sure that the \"a\" and \"b\" match in the correct position rather than having any importance themselves (the wildcards are supposed to be replaced by other states). So merging with a pattern like \"c...d\" would lead to \"c..ad..b\".\n\nSo what I'm wondering whether it's possible to get rid of the wildcards and still have an acyclic automata that minimises correctly? Research papers on this, or similar topics are especially appreciated.\n\nAlternatively I may just be looking at this the wrong way? Personally I suspect it's not actually possible...\n\nIncidentally the reason for this though is mostly curiosity, most acyclic algorithms minimises in linear time to the number of states, given that the wildcards are purely filler I wondered whether the wildcards could be done away with, perhaps getting replaced by an index and a counter (not a good solution). My best idea so far is to sort of build a tree with the required states in the correct position, but that sort of creates a lot of overhead.\n\n",

        "text": "So I had this idea for some time, it would be a physical simulation. Let's say we have N cities traveling salesman problem. We place N devices on a plane so that their positioning corresponds to the arrangement of our cities. Each device is capable of two things:\n\n1) Emit light of wavelength unique to that city/device in our system\n\n2) Copy / retranslate wavelength that hit it\n\nSo at the beginning of experiment the setup is completely dark. Then we make initial city emit a pulse of light in its wavelength. This fucker propagates, and as it hits other devices it activates them, but those activated devices now emit light in their unique wavelength + wavelength of initial device. This goes on for a short period of time, the experiment stops when a pulse of light containing all wavelengths hits back the initial device. Then I don't know we somehow backtrack that shit to get the optimal path or something.\n\nI have tried googling it and came up with this: \"An Optical Solution For The Traveling Salesman Problem\" https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-15-16-10473 which seemed to me a lot like my idea, only you know more smarter :D with interferometers and optic cables\n\nWhat do you think guys? Am I a smart person or a fucking dumbass? Also, there is no mention of possible optical solutions of the TSP in the Wikipedia article, should somebody add a link to https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-15-16-10473 ?",

        "text": "So i'm working on solving a combinational problem (find the powerset) using recursive backtracking and noticed that there is a template to do backtracking problems.\n\n**problem statement: Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).**\n\nFor a given set of N distinct integers there are 2^N combinations. So one can compute it using the following algorithm where 'cur' stores the partial combination, and 'allSubsets' is called itself 2 times within its body: 1 without the i'th element added to 'cur', and the 2nd call after the i'th element added to 'cur' (after cur.emplace_back and before cur.pop_back)\n\n**approach-1:**\n\n    class Solution {\n    public:\n    vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; subsets(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) {\n        vector &lt; vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; res;\n        vector &lt;int&gt; cur;\n        allSubsets(nums, cur, 0, res);\n        return res;\n    }  \n    void allSubsets(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v, vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; cur, int idx, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&amp; res) {\n        if (idx == v.size()) {\n            res.emplace_back(cur);\n            return;\n        } \n        allSubsets(v, cur, idx+1, res);\n        cur.emplace_back(v[idx]);\n        allSubsets(v, cur, idx+1, res);\n        cur.pop_back();\n    }\n    };\n\nThis approach above of recursive backtracking is understandable due to the reasoning that for every element we are considering two paths-- 1 with elements included and the 2nd with element excluded.\n\nBut I recently saw this following backtracking approach to do the same (generate all subsets), which doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't seem similar to above as genSets is being called a variable # of times within its body than exact 2 times in the previous approach.\n\n**approach-2:**\n\n    class Solution {\n    public:\n    vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; subsets(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) {\n        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());\n        vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; subs;\n        vector&lt;int&gt; sub;  \n        genSubsets(nums, 0, sub, subs);\n        return subs; \n    }\n    void genSubsets(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums, int start, vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; sub, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&amp; subs) {\n        subs.push_back(sub);\n        for (int i = start; i &lt; nums.size(); i++) {\n            sub.push_back(nums[i]);\n            genSubsets(nums, i + 1, sub, subs);\n            sub.pop_back();\n        }\n    }\n    };\n\n\n**So how is it doing the same work, can someone explain? In 'genSubsets' where are subsets that exclude the current index being formed?**\n\nIf nums was {1, 2, 3, 4}, where would the subset {1, 2, 3} get constructed as we don't call genSubsets are pop_back or before sub.push_back? I've spent hours trying to understand this second approach with no luck and confused how it works and is similar to the approach-1 above as this one seems to make N^N calls (more than 2^N)?\n",

Then using the following construction, it would be possible to decide the halting problem for any input w:\n\n    def R(&lt;M&gt;, w) \n        u = w\n        v = arbitrary\n        L(u,v) \n        L(v,u) \n        accept \n\n\nIf &lt;M&gt; does not halt on w, either L(u,v) or L(v,u) would loop. Otherwise it halts and therefore R(&lt;M&gt;, w) accepts.\n\nTherefore H ≤ L and because the halting problem is undecidable (and not co-semi-decidable) L is undecidable and not co-semi-decidable.\n\nNow my approach for showing that it is also not semi-decidable is using the Complement of Lu,v and reversing the arguments, then reducing that to Halting Problem as well.\n\nIs this a valid proof?\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated\n\nAlso I hope this does not invalidate the \"introductory material\" rule, but I just couldn't find a formal and correct solution for this problem.\n\nThanks!",

The probabilities that the treasure is behind door $i$ is $p_i$ and it is known to you. You can start trying opening the doors, and you would like to find the treasure by opening as few doors as possible. The problem is that, after you look behind a door, if the treasure is not there the door is closed and *you lose your memory of what door you just opened*. The question is, what is the probability distribution with which you should choose doors in order to minimize the number of attempts?\n\nThe proof is an easy exercise, but I would like a reference to the original paper by Solomonoff in which this result appeared first.
