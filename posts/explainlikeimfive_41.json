He checked my eyes and said that i was didn't need any glasses at all. He then asked more questions and said that maybe my eyes were locked into focus and needed to relax so he dialated my eyes and gave me perscription for +0.5 and +0.25. Ther was also a correction for an astigmatism. The first i put them on everything got suoer crisp and crystal clear. It honestly wasn't a huge difference. I can still read perfectly fine without the glasses but things went from SD to HD. Why wasn't the doctor able to tell i needed a perscription  until i got my eyes dialated? Why did that even work?",
