For example volcanoes in Iceland but also more abstract things like sunken german submarines in the mediterranean or nuclear testing sites.\n\nWould love feedback through reddit or the feedback page on the site menu.\n\nCheck it out, works best on computers but mobile works too:\n\nExamples:\n\n[https://copernix.io/about/](https://copernix.io/about/)\n\nSearch Page:\n\n[https://copernix.io](https://copernix.io)\n\nIf you like it please share onwards\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3nx7af02ghz01.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/weqwlx56ghz01.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xn9y0476ghz01.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i2hbnw56ghz01.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hf096x56ghz01.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zb0bw3afghz01.jpg",
