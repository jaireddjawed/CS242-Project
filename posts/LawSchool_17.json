But I don’t have big law grades yet and not positive I ever will. \n2) do international human rights work — if I can somehow break into that seemingly niche market, and I don’t think it pays very well? \n\n… and that’s about it, besides the foreign service or JAG. I’ve asked around, but haven’t found much help in discovering more job options abroad, what I should do this summer since big law isn’t going to happen, etc. I could do an LLM, too, which seems the most feasible option. \n\nSo if anyone here is working abroad with a JD, I’d love to know how you did it and what kind of opportunities exist for people who want to follow in your footsteps.

It's not my dream job by any means, but it's a good position and I thought it would give me helpful skills moving forward. Today, however, I saw that my dream fellowship was posted, in the specific (very niche) issue area where I have focused my studies and internships. I have connections to those at the organization, outstanding recommendations, a great resume, and think I am exactly the person they would choose. Can I back out of my other offer, or just accept the L? I am worried that I won't have another opportunity to work at an organization like this for years, so it feels hard to give up.",

I am starting to be a bit concerned I won’t be able to actually attend because of the cost. I just gradation from undergrad and I have little to no credit so aside from the guaranteed federal loan through fafsa, I’m not sure if I’ll be approved for outside/private student loans. I’m a independent student, parents are deceased so no co-signer available to help. I’ve googled but have gotten very general and broad results.

        "text": "This may be a bit of a complicated situation, but I'll try to be as coherent as possible. Basically, I have the option to pursue a career in Law in either the US or the UK (I am American, my wife is English) and am wondering which path would be quickest/ cheapest/ most lucrative (both financially and personally). \n\nMy ideal career path, wether in the US or UK, would be to work in Big law (or midlaw/ govt), save aggressively, and either transition in-house or 'soft retire' back to international teaching, which was my first career path out of college. I know that big law is extremely competitive and can be very stressful- I currently work in Big law as a paralegal, so I'm familiar with the environment- and really I don't have much intent, if any, to make partner. I just want to save up to the extent that I'm able, and get out to something potentially more fulfilling/ rewarding.\n\nMy partner and I would probably like to settle in the UK at some point, and there are two big draws for doing so sooner rather than later:\n\n 1) visa processing in the US is inordinately slow and time-consuming, and I could potentially be a year or two into a UK law degree before my fiance is even granted her temporary GC. \n2) the cost of a UK law degree could potentially be as little as 1/10th what it is in the US. \n\nI do have my concerns about following this path in the UK, however. There is a seeming lack of relative earning potential in the UK for both of us, and I'm also concerned that I'd need an LLB from the UK (I studied English at a university in the US) prior to obtaining an LLM, thus elongating my path to becoming an attorney by atleast several years. I also think it'd be even harder to break into UK Big law than in the US, and I'm concerned that an LLM isn't as 'prestigous' as a JD, and might not open quite as many doors and would be basically worthless were I to move back to the US, or work for a US company, at some point.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some general advice, and am not really sure what to do. I want to have flexibility, set myself up well for the future, and actually get to live with my wife. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!!\n\nTldr: should I get a law degree in the US or UK?",
