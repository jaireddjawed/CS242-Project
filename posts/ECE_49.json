        "text": "I've been intermittently posting around about building a headphone tube amplifier, and I'd like an onboard DAC for USB input (as well as 3.5mm input in parallel). I've found a solid DAC and wanted to get other's thoughts. [Here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/PCM2706-CS4344-USB-Powered-MINI-USB-Sound-Card-DAC-Decode-Board-1PC-/361918329490?hash=item5444037292:g:-mUAAOxyYANTazTs) is the item in question. \n\nI've been told the PCM270X is a good chip. It says 16 bits, 32-48 kHz sampling rate. I know I need at least 44.2 kHz for the Nyquist requirement. Does this seem like a good choice? 24 bit seems like overkill and they're much more expensive (and difficult to find as a standalone board). My board will also have monitor outputs (directly tied to the input, no onboard amplification) and I don't want to by wasting the monitor's potential with a subpar DAC.",

I know this is hugely impacted by the product/company/etc. so I don't expect a recipe, but an idea of what different things it requires and the level of detail it goes into, naturally a lot of things can't be fully defined until some design has been done.\n\nBackground on why I'm asking in this is because while working in a small company has the perk of getting right onto the hands on design, proper documentation takes the back seat and it's come back to bite us in the ass before. I'm starting a new project and with system requirements close to done I'd like to know what the proper step to hardware requirements would be. \n\nThanks for any help",

They realize that when people overfill their gas tanks, gas is spilled and evaporates causing air pollution. To minimize this problem, their pumps currently turn off when the back pressure from the gas tank gets too large while the nozzle switch is activated (i.e., compressed).\nDesign a controller that does the following: If the nozzle switch is depressed and the pump pressure sensor indicates low pressure, then allow gas to be pumped. If the pump pressure sensor indicates high-pressure when the nozzle switch is depressed, then turn the pump off. (The system clock pulses every two seconds and you may assume that once the pump shuts off, the pump pressure returns to normal within two seconds.) Once the pressure returns to normal, allow the pump to be controlled again by the nozzle switch. If the pump pressure sensor indicates high pressure a second time, your design will permanently shut down the pump until reset by the gas station personnel. (Note that there are two inputs to your synchronous machine: the nozzle switch position, and the pump pressure sensor indicator. Your synchronous machine has one output that controls the pump.)\n\nSo here is where I am at. \n\nI finished the Moore machine for this problem. For the mealy machine, we were told all we need is 3 states. I am really confused on what states are needed in the mealy version. I created a circuit after going through all the steps but my output is only in terms of Ns and Pi (Nozzle Switch and Pressure Indicator) which are my inputs, specifically i get y = Ns.Pi' ... shouldn't Mealy be in terms of my inputs AND current state?",

I found all the classes pretty easy even though the averages of them are in the 50s.  However I hate discrete math and proofs.  Data structures/algorithms was interesting but most of it felt pretty trivial.  This has me thinking I may belong in the computer engineering field since I really like circuits/physics/calculus which is no where to be found in the computer science program at my university.  Everyone tells me I should stay with computer science because of the jobs and higher salary.  I enjoy programming, but I would like to get a job that isn't strictly just programming.  I am doing an internship right now as a backend developer and find it very boring as it's basically gluing together various API's, trouble shooting tedious bugs, then getting it running on a server.  Do you think I should make the switch over?  I need to get a job in NY state when I graduate.  My interests are robotics, computer architecture, computer security, embedded systems, financial tech, and machine learning.  I've heard things such as most of the computer engineering jobs are now in China.  I've also heard the whole you can get cs jobs as a CE major, but if I'm going to get a cs job I don't see why I wouldn't just do cs.  Any input will be greatly appreciated.  This choice is killing me :(\n\nAlso just another quick add on, the CE department is part of the electrical department at my university.  So the only cs courses I'm required to take in addition the the ones mentioned above for CE are operating systems and advanced unix/c programming.  I could probably do a cs minor to take algorithms and databases as well.  \n\nEdit:  sorry I've been answering on my other account, I didn't even realize I was doing this.

Now, I have read a lot of articles and watched a lot of tutorials on how to accomplish this task, but, I cannot seem to find anything concrete on the subject. At this point, I need urgent help.

Manufacturers make fancy expensive lasers that break speed records with capacities that most consumers have no use for, like 10 Gbit/s. Sometimes it would be enough to just have license-free walkie talkie two-way \"radio\" with excellent sound quality by transmitting 100Kbit/s to kilometer away in line-of-sight. (Separately, the transmitter could be used as a flash light by changing a less focused lens, if wavelength is not near-infrared but visible light.)\n\nIt is possible to use 1 or 2 drones or hydrogen balloon aerostats as communication links. Also, on a cloudy night, bright enough LED, maybe 500 lumens, can be reflected from a cloud, with enough speed at least for talking. Beam of blue light is visible without clouds, thanks to rayleigh scattering, but has weaker signal.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication\n\n\nMany places have 10 kilometer visibility 90% of the time.\n\nThis has a software angle.

I'm about to graduate with a thesis based MSECE, and have not been impressed with the quality of the technical writing course/ resources I've had available through the school. The tech writing course I took here was a bit of a joke. IMHO, we spent far too much time discussing syntax errors, taking part in online discussions for homework credit, and doing high school level exercises (subject/ predicate to/too/two type stuff). I feel that we never really got into what separates technical writing from narrative writing. Even the campus resources for thesis writers are pretty much wholly focused on proper syntax and format requirements (margins, template conformity etc), and as a result don't offer much in the way of the substance of the writing. There are plenty of people who utilize these resources, non-native English writers for instance, and I don't intend to disparage them. However, my needs are different and (again, imho) not met.\n\nSo, for those of you who have developed clear, concise, complete technical writing skills, how best can I improve? I'm rewriting my resume (again) now, trying to cut out as much fluff as possible, use more scientific/ technical language, get as far away from the \"narrative\" style as possible, etc.  I'm making a concerted effort to write and speak as carefully as I can (I'm allowing this post to take the narrative format, maybe that's an opportunity right there). But the essential problem is that I'm my own barometer here.\n\nI hope this make sense. The general idea is that I think I'll get a lot better at chess by playing with a superior player than I will only playing myself.\n\nThanks everyone, I'm hoping this adds value to the community.",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI want to thank everyone for the interest you've have had regarding FreeRTOS-addons as well as all of your feedback! I've released version 1.3.1 which contains the following changes:\n\nAdded an implementation of conditional variables. Very useful for some problems. These are not enabled by default, you'll need to include the conditional variable files and define CPP_FREERTOS_CONDITION_VARIABLES in your makefile or project.\n\nAdded the ability to remove the usage of C++ strings from the library. Just define CPP_FREERTOS_NO_CPP_STRINGS in your makefile or project. Note that if you do this, you also must define CPP_FREERTOS_NO_EXCEPTIONS. Exceptions use C++ strings in this library.\n\nFixed bugs discovered related to defining vTaskDelete to 0. Many thanks to Ewout Boks from the HAN technical college, Arnhem, the Netherlands for finding these.\n\nBest regards,\n-Mike Becker\n\n\nModified Original Posting Below:\n\nHi All,\n\nFor anyone who may be interested, I've created an object oriented interface on top of FreeRTOS using C++ classes that encapsulate most of the fundamental APIs. They allow you to craft a project using C++ code and conventions while handling the interface logic between the C and C++ code for you.\n\nThis C++ API currently provides or encapsulates: Critical sections Mutexes Queues Reader / Writer locks (new feature) Semaphores Tasklets (Pended Functions) Threads (Tasks) Tick Hooks Ticks Timers\n\nThe project page (WIP): https://michaelbecker.github.io/freertos-addons/\n\nVersion 1.3.1 of the code for download: https://github.com/michaelbecker/freertos-addons/releases/tag/v1.3.1\n\nAnd the complete repository where you can browse the code and project online: https://github.com/michaelbecker/freertos-addons\n\nThis is actually part of a larger project of mine, where I'd like to continue to add functionality to FreeRTOS and make it publicly available through github. With regards to the C++ wrappers, there are 42 demo / unit test programs specifically exercizing it. I also updated / modified the work William Davy did in his Posix port to get all of the demos running on multicore Linux workstations for testing with the newer FreeRTOS versions. This revised Posix port I renamed to Linux port, since I ended up using a few Linux specific APIs in it.\n\nEverything was testing successfully using FreeRTOS versions 8.2.3 and 9.0.0.\n\nBest regards \n-Mike Becker\n\n",

I don't want to build a malicious device, I only want to detect if a card exist, not read any of the information. Is this possible? Thoughts/Comments? Is there a better way to do this? \n\nSeems I would need some type of antenna, reader, and then software (i've seen apps on the iOS and Android). \n\nRegards,\n\nRd09 ",

I'm not sure if I just caught this particular HR person on a bad day or what (it was Friday and I'm sure the end of the work week can feel heavy for some folks), but it was a very confusing experience for me.\n\nI currently am a lab intern, now on a part-time basis, at a group within a pretty large semiconductor company that deals with lighting controls. Even in the past, I've sent pretty respectful e-mails inquiring for a status update about positions I've applied for or simply happen to have a few questions about. By no means do I demand a reply, and I'm not calling these folks on the phone or anything like that - just an e-mail.\n\nI was told \"e-mailing multiple people at one company is a red flag for hiring\". I e-mailed two people, total, one about the past interview and one about a position I was interested in and wanted to learn more about. This company the HR fella represented is by no means small as well - it's a large, multinational computer company that has a pretty big grasp on storage technologies. \n\nI might be overthinking things, but **what are your rules for etiquette when communicating for a job search?** I always thought I was fine in that regard, but I'm beginning to wonder if I perhaps come across as too inquisitive. My individual job search so far this year hasn't been going all that well, and more or less I'm stuck in the same position that a family member helped me get an year ago. Also, is trying to reach out online too much a bad thing? \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I am a high school senior who is having quite a bit of trouble deciding which college he wants to attend this upcoming fall. I am deciding between San Jose State University, San Diego State University, Cal Poly Pomona and UC Santa Cruz. I consider myself an average student with a 3.6 UW GPA, 1260/1600 SAT, and 27 ACT. My local university is San Jose State, but I want to give myself some time before I officially decide where I want to enroll.\n\nThe main factors that I look for in a college are the quality of education as well as the amount of connections available within the area. I am well aware that San Jose State is located in Silicon Valley, which is a great place for tech. However, I would love to dorm and have a great college experience away from home.\n\nI feel like UC Santa Cruz would be a great place for me to have an awesome college experience, although it is still fairly close to home. San Diego State would be more of an ideal place for that kind of thing, but I fear that San Diego does not offer as much networking and connections that are related to the tech industry.\n\nAny advice regarding which college I should attend is greatly appreciated!",

I work for a mid-sized companies raking in about the 80's, which really aint too shabby. The questions I'm struggling to answer are such:\n\n1) Do I want to continue working for corporate America?\n\n2) How do I get beyond the 80-120k financial trajectory I see for myself if I decide to stay in industry? I think my financial goals are more along the line of 150-200k, is this even possible??\n\n3) Can I supplement my income by freelancing, either analog or embedded, is that a thing?\n\n4) Anyone here start a side business while working full time and have it become successful?\n\nI'd love to be that noble guy who says I'm not in it for the money, but honestly I care very much about being financially secure, wanting to do the things I enjoy, and not having to penny pinch. Anyone's input on any of the above would be welcomed :)",

I would like to use i2c to communicate with the battery management devices. So far I have the following 2 devices picked out.\n\n* Battery Charger - TI BQ24262 - [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24262.pdf)\n* Charge Level - TI BQ34110 - [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq34110.pdf)\n\nMy question is, is there anything else I would need in order to make sure the battery is safely charged and discharge?\n\nAlso since the cell is nominal 3.7v and I want a 5v output, I assume when I turn on BGATE, on the BQ24262, the BQ24262 will provide 5v while the battery is acting as a current source. Is that correct?\n\nThanks for the help!",
