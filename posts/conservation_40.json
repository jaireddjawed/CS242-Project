Andrew Merrie, the project lead and a scientist at U. of Stockholm, is exploring how this approach may make science and futurism more approachable to the non-scientific audience.\n\nI see merits and flaws in the approach. One is that people absorb information in different ways, and the rationalist paradigm and scientific (or science-journalism) writing styles simply don't resonate with some people, where fiction might. At the same time, environmental science writ large struggles with a continual assertion from certain political and ideological groups that it's generally junk-science. Mixing science and science fiction may work against efforts to legitimate environmental science among a non-scientific audience.\n\nWhat do redditors think? Is this a net-positive or negative? What are the major pros and cons of using speculative fiction to sell environmental science and conservation?\n\nEdit: For a bit of further reading, /u/llafr recently posted a different article about the same project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/541fvn/illustrated_utopian_and_dystopian_radical_futures/).",

Anyways, I'm 17 rn and I'm taking college classes. I thought I wanted to do anthropology, but I don't want to do it so much anymore. However, I've already taken some anthro classes, so I'd be pretty close to getting an anthro degree. Okay so my question is what's the best degree for this career? I would like to stay at my city's uni, but they only have two degrees that seem to maybe pertain to conservation that I'd actually be interested in: anthro and biology (w/ a ecology and evolution focus). HOWEVER, there is another university (in another far city that I do not want to go to for various reasons) that actually offers a wildlife conservation degree! I'm just at loss on what to do because I want to stay in my city and don't know which degree is best. Thank you! ",

Who's to say deceptive tactics aren't at work, especially when you have so much money being thrown your way?\n\nSo, my question is, if this hunting for conservation strategy actually works, why is it not used for all declining species, in particular the great apes?",
