They were symmetrical on both sides of the bed (about where the stomach is when lying down). We have a dog, but no way could he get that wet. Also the door was closed all day. The only person sleeping on that bed said that those weren't there when she left in the morning. The ceiling was completely dry with no marks of dripping water. I was at the house all day and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary and I didn't have anyone come over.\nWhat happened?",

        "text": "Honestly, my own personal \"False Memory\" experience freaked me out the most...\n\nA Dracula: Untold video game that apparently never existed.\n\nIt pretty much mirrored the movie &amp; different checkpoints in the game happened at different scenes in the movie, with video game versions of the movie as cutscenes.\n\nI was rewatching the film and thought of the game and wondered what ever happened to my copy. So, I started looking around. Was it a PC game? Can't find it on my computer. Hmm... Was it for XBox? Can't find it there. Maybe Google can help me... No mention at all online. WTF? No mention of this game online? Doesn't this game even exist?\n\nI can recall the game rather well, especially particular parts of the game that annoyed me because I kept getting stuck on them. Dracula's climb to Broken Tooth had the same look as in the movie when you got to the top. During the fight to get to his son &amp; wife, after he turned, and watch his buddy die, had a time limit to get to him or you'd have to start over. And game cutscenes pretty much mimicked movie scenes.\n\nDuring the one-man battle scene, with the sword flashing, I kept getting killed and having to start over. The tower scene, before his wife dies, had you climb the tower rather than bat-fly (after bat-flying to get there), and it had a time limit. I kept running out of time &amp; having to start the climb all over again before wife fell (partially because I couldn't figure out the climbing control). Took a few tries to figure out.\n\nThe fight at the end with his ex \"buddy\" &amp; the bags of silver was a pain in the ass to play. He kept breaking bags &amp; you'd be stuck for a few seconds under a pile of silver, while he wailed on you. Took 20 minutes or so to get past that part. And during the fight against the other vampires to save his son at the end, I kept getting stuck on that &amp; dying &amp; having to start that part over. I recall not finishing that part &amp; thus never got to see if the game ended the same way as the movie.\n\nAll the other random oddities that seem to have changed pales in comparison to spending hours playing a video game that was never made.",

I could have mistakenly taken someone’s knife, but I find it rather unlikely.\n\nTL;DR: Knife appears out of thin air.\nPS: Sorry for the bad grammar.\n",

I once came up with an idea for an episode, which was that the penguins had to defeat an orca. A few days later, the episode \"Skorca!\" was released. It was really weird for me, everything in the episode was identical to my \"idea\"(except my idea was to have the orca real, instead of it being a balloon like in the episode). I definitely did not see the episode before my idea.\n\nI know there is really no explanation for this, but SERIOUSLY, what were the chances!!!!",

The little girl let go of my hand and kind of ran up to her, I️ think because the little girl just loved people. The girl said hi, and the woman just stood there staring at her like she didn’t know what a child was. She was confused, but like she didn’t know what she was looking at, almost scared. The little girl was confused too, because most people say hi back, so she just walked back to me, and I️ was a bit scared so we went back to her house. This is the even weirder part. A couple days later, I️ went back, and the little girls mom was there and suggested we go to that same neighbors house and play with her kids. I️ was a bit surprised, but went over. When we met the mom of those kids, she was wonderful but looked completely different from the woman from a few days back. Not skinny, very nice. I️ asked the mom of the little girl I️ babysat if they had been robbed or something recently, and she said they are very close friends, and she would have told her if something like that happened, which I‎t didn’t.

        "text": "Last night had numerous levels of a very bizarre but fascinating experience. Before going to bed I had some aged blue cheese. After two hours in bed I had two selenium vitamins. With this combo I was expecting some sort of Astral Adventures and was disappointed when waking up five hours after bedtime with no results.\n\nSeconds after awakening I hear a beeping noise. This has happened before after extended astral travel/lucid dreams but is very rare. About five seconds after the beep I hear a womans voice say Load Imagery. This is not a false awakening or sleep paralysis. These two things themselves have me making mental notes of the experience.\n\nAfter drinking some water, I get back in bed and close my eyes. After about 15 minutes of wondering and hypothesizing what has occured, I am now awake in another dimension. It is a semi run down apartment and there is a woman sitting at a table across from me. Looking out the window this a heavily populated neighborhood in some unknown city. Upon stepping in front of a mirror I see some guy I do not recognise. The woman, the apartment and this city do not resonate with me at all. The woman looks at me sort of confused and I think she senses that something is not right. At this point my feeling is that I have temporarily stepped into someone else's Projected Avatar.\n\nBeginning to get nervous I walk out of the room and downstairs to the street. The city disappears and instantly I am now in an completely enormous, weird and creepy building. It looks like a perverse, deranged carnival of some sort. I find a mirror and see that I am now in my own Projected Avatar. This is me. I cannot explain how absolutely Real this place was. In fact it felt so \"real\" that I was actually scared that I had gone to far into this Astral Area. Usually you can feel the silver cord and a small percentage of you still connected to the physical dimension. I have never felt so deeply immersed into this dimension before, but knew I had to use this opportunity for exploration.\n\nUpon walking outside, there are many people, and it is sunny and normal looking. At this point I am watching a car commercial and then a soda commercial for some unknown brands. The thing is I am not just watching the commercial. I am actually standing inside of it. The commercial is fully interactive.\n\nA revelation has just occurred in my mind. I yell out \"The physical and the Astral Dimnesions are being Broadcasted. They are both fully interactive programs, reality shows, or whatever you want to call them. And we are actually inside of this transmission. We are the Receivers\".\n\nThere is a friendly looking hippy type guy standing next to me with what seems to be his girlfriend. He says \" We Are In The Matrix, Man... They call it the Hotel California\"...\n\nImmediately I am now back in my bed. Sweating and freaked out. I get up and print out the lyrics to the song I am very familiar with:\n\n\"Last thing I remember, I was running for the door, I had to find the passage back to the place I was before, 'Relax' said the night man, 'We are programmed to receive. You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!\"\n\n",

        "text": "Ive had this thing for as long as I can remember where, when I look at a certain place or object, it can give me a feeling of being somewhere else. It's similar to synesthesia in the sense that I can feel different places when I'm in or looking at a place, but I'm not sure if its exactly similar because its not always the same feeling. I have a really hard time explaining it but ill do my best. For example, if i look at a house that has a certain aesthetic or look about it, it will remind me of somewhere else, almost like a nostalgic feeling of something reminding you of a place you've been when you were little, except its almost always somewhere I've never been. For example, if i see a house that looks European, ill feel this overwhelming feeling of being in some random place in europe I've never been in. Its not that it'll just remind of a place, it'll give me a feeling of almost being there. Its kind of similar to the cozy homey feeling you get when you're wrapped up in a big blanket when its raining outside. it happens with certain objects too but usually just with places I'm at or buildings or areas i see. its been driving me crazy because i can't find anything online about it and idk how to describe it properly to even find it. anyone know if this is an actual disorder? or do i just have an overactive imagination?",

Completely unopened. We both had a what the fuck moment, and I decided to look through the trash bin in our bedroom where I threw the wrapper out, and it wasn't in there!\nI know for sure that there was only one chocolate bar that he put in his bag, so my mind is completely blown.\n\nWe laughed about how bizzare the situation was, and I told him he can eat the entire thing to himself this time.

That's why when I had this dream at such a young age, I thought nothing of it. In fact, I'd largely forgotten that I ever had the dream. That is, until a local construction firm built the house I dreamed of. \n\nMany years after the dream, the wire/concrete fences disappear from around a site, and a new cul de sac is populated. This isn't a run of the mill cul de sac. There is a distinct brickweave pattern on the road, kerb and pavement, a sunset colour scheme complete with almost fake-looking complimentary lime green conifer trees. Very *suburban*. \n\nAs lovely as that all is, this house - the whole area, in fact - fits *exactly* with the dream I had years before this place was even built. Every detail is identical as I remember it. I get severe déjà vu every time I drive past it. The first time I saw it, I got that sense of deep familiarity, but it took me a moment to place just what and why this is happening, but now I know and there's no doubt about it; I dreamt of this place. I've seen it before. \n\nNo, I don't live in this house now, as one might expect a story like this to lead to. ",

        "text": "Hello all.\n(First time posting so bear with me as I’m not entirely sure if this qualifies.)\n\nFirst off a little about me, I am a Puerto Rican male, aged 26 who is in the USMCR working at a waste facility as my civilian job. I operate heavy equipment (front end loaders and such) and drive tractor trailers. I am relatively intelligent, I love reading, have no psychological issues, sane, respectful and hardly superstitious. I tend to be quiet but I’m extremely observant and have quite a sound memory. Which leads me to my...incident today. \nI was in a loader about two hours into my shift, when a coworker (James) asks my supervisor over the radio for a code to unlock the gate to let a driver in. After a brief pause my supervisor (Fred) replies that he doesn’t know it. Our electrician (Peter) on site chimes in and says that the code is on the wall in the supervisors office, but that Peter has the code somewhere and can go and get it. \nPretty standard uneventful conversation. \nHowever, this is where things got a little weird. \nFred says over the radio.\n“James I found the code it’s 19345 try it”\n“....”\n“James did it work?”\n“...no”\n“Ok, try it again with the pound sign at the end”\n“Yeah I tried that too it’s not working.” \nThis is when Peter chimes in again.\n“Yeah uh James it’s definitely 19345, I have it written on a piece of paper here” \n“Ok” says James \n“Let me know” says Peter\nThen there was a lot of static over the radio, extremely uncommon, and then Peter again.\n“Yeah uh James it’s definitely 19345, I have it written on a piece of paper here.” \n.......my heart immediately started racing. \nHe said, the exact same thing, in the exact same tone, with the exact same nuances and pauses as what he previously said. It was something so simple, but profound, because deep down, I understood that it wasn’t him verifying or repeating himself but it was essentially a clone of what he said just a few seconds ago. The exact same thing. \n\nI was fully rested, not delirious, of sound mind, stone cold sober, the cab was quiet, so I heard it quite clearly. And I couldn’t move, I was paralyzed because I knew that couldn’t have just happened. I consider myself as a rational person so I’ve been trying to convince myself that he was just repeating the code to a coworker, but it doesn’t add up. Why would he say the same exact specific thing again? Peter already got a confirmation, it doesn’t make sense. It’s been gnawing on my mind all day... a mental splinter as it were. \n\nTo make it all the more eerie, the conversation ends quite abruptly. \n\n“Ok it works now, thank you”\n\nAnd that was the end of the conversation.\n\nDefinitely a small situation, I’m not sure if it’s worth mentioning, but it felt extremely real. My heart was racing and I was in disbelief. It takes a lot to make me feel like that. I don’t scare easily. But please, let me know what you think, and what your take on it is. And I’d be happy to answer any questions. Thanks! \n\n",

        "text": "So I read an article last Saturday that was a reminder to set your clocks forward an hour for daylight savings time  that night and I specifically remember it being for last Saturday night and not yesterday night, So I changed my alarm clock so it would be correct last Saturday and I knew my phone would change automatically so I went to bed. When I woke up I was more tired than I normal because I had lost one hour of sleep. And my phone and alarm clock were in sync at 8:00a.m. After that I got ready and went to go pick up my s/o so we could go to church that morning. When she got in my truck she mentioned that I had forgotten to change the time on my radio so she changed it for me. Fast forward one week later to this morning, and I woke up to my alarm clock and it was set to 8:00a.m. and when I checked my phone it was actually 9:00a.m. and I had a missed call from my s/o and a text asking if I had forgotten about daylight savings and I was really confused because I remembered daylight savings being the week before. I knew I was going to be late so I decided to just get ready and go. I picked up my s/o and asked them if they remembered last weekend being daylight savings and they said it was definitely this weekend and they don't remember changing my trucks clock when I know they did.  I'm not really sure what happened to me because I specifically remember daylight savings being last weekend and I changed my clocks and everything was fine but this weekend it's like everything was reversed. My s/o keeps telling me it was probably just a dream but I remember all of this clearly and I know it wasn't a dream. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just me?\n\ntldr: I remembered daylight savings being last weekend and changed all my clocks and they were correct all week until this morning when I had to change them all again and no one remembers it being last weekend.",

It’s not a phone number, it’s not a code I use for work, it’s not my bank account, it’s not a credit card number, it’s not my most recent school ID number, it’s not my address—I have no idea what this number is!\n\nI know I’ve used it often and many times before, but I can’t for the life of me remember where. My hands seem pretty comfortable typing it on a keyboard, so I know I’ve typed it out many times before? Any thoughts? Literally day 3 of me wanting to type this number instead of usual codes I use to access portals and documents.",

Then this morning when I was driving home from the gym (so I've now driven about 40 miles since being disappointed I had only half a tank of gas, which should mean I'm down another eighth of a tank) I noticed that I had three quarters of a tank. I'm not complaining about the extra gas but it's definitely weird!",

        "text": "This is not creepy or mind blowing per se, but it’s something I’ve never told anyone because I have no way to prove it other than my own memory. This is however very true.\n\nWhen I was younger my family and I did a lot of driving. Whether it was hockey or baseball tournaments out of town or just going on vacation. I would mostly listen to my diskman and play my gameboy but, being an only child, I didn’t have any company in the back seat.\n\nI would make up “games” in my head to pass the time. One such game involved me looking out the window at the power lines above and imagining (specifically) a bug running along them, jumping over the pole tops and other obstacles as they passed.\n\nI can’t pinpoint what year I first played this “game” in my head but I would say sometime between 1997 and 2002.\n\nSome years later, while on a flash game site, I see a game that is a near carbon copy of the game I played in my head. It’s called Bug on a Wire and was also converted into a mobile app. Couldn’t find when the game was first uploaded but it was long after the last time I “played” in my head. Needless to say I was awestruck for a good few moments. It was easily one of the strangest feelings I’ve ever had and didn’t feel like anyone would believe me or, if they did, even begin to imagine what it was like.\n\n\n\nJust a personal story I thought some might find interesting. Maybe some can even relate.\n\n\n",

When i was finished i made sure to turn off the lights and TV. It was now about 2 a.m.\n\nI tried falling asleep, but my attempt was interrupted by voices, a woman's and a man's, that seemed to be arguing VERY loudly. I checked the time, it was 2:10. I was completely awake and sitting up. My first thought was that my mom woke up from me watching TV, and decided to watch TV herself. I didn't hear footsteps go to the living room though. If she was watching TV, the volume was very loud which was unlike her to not notice. Didn't think the TV was that plausible. \n\nThought maybe mom and dad were arguing, but that didn't make sense at 2 in the morning, and the woman's voice didn't sound like my mom's.\n\nIt couldn't be the neighbors as i live a decent bit away from the other houses and street and have never heard the neighbors before, not even during parties. Not to mention this sounded as though it was coming from a room next to me.\n\nI was a bit confused and decided it was mom watching TV, and waited for the noise to fade out so i could fall asleep.\n\nWoke up, asked if anyone was talking or was awake at 2 a.m., no one was. No one watched TV, nothing. I was the only one awake. \n\nSo who did i hear arguing in my house?? \n",
