One of the characters (the main character?) had his dead wife's uploaded consciousness in his brain somehow, like he could hear her speak and have internal conversations with her. Hopefully that last part narrows it down some.",

        "text": "Question if the Dark Forest were real, would it work the way we hypothesize? \n\nNOTE: I've read the Three Body Problem series which examines the Dark Forest concept particularly in the 2nd book Dark Forest. \n\nThe Dark Forest Hypothesis Explained: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUJYP8tnRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUJYP8tnRE) \n\nIn the Dark Forest Hypothesis the reason why there's no evidence of extraterrestrial life is because anytime an alien race makes it's presence known it's destroyed by another race because destroying them outright is allegedly the safest option, but is it?   \n\n\nLet's say you have a hunter in the Dark Forest (a sufficiently advanced alien race) and suddenly they hear a voice call out in the darkness \"I'm by the base of the white birch tree\" (this represents a message broadcast out into space). The Hunter knows where that is so he takes aim and fires, his gun lighting up the dark. He believes that he's just removed an existential threat to himself as life is always in competition for resources and he just eliminated competition. And that's the last thing he ever thinks before a bullet goes flying through his brain (i.e. that civilization gets destroyed). Why did this happen?   \n\n\nWell let's consider what the hunter civilization knows when they hear the voice calling out.\n\n1. Somewhere out there is  an intelligent alien civilization\n2. This civilization is advanced enough to have the technology to broadcast a message out into the void presumably trying to answer the Fermi Paradox (i.e. where are all the aliens)\n3. (Possibly not sure on the science of this but they may be able to tell vaguely the direction the message came from and the approximate distance???) \n\nThat's it that's all the hunter knows. Now you might say no the Hunter knows where the other civilization is they just told them. But the Hunter civilization doesn't know that for certain, the other civilization could be lying. And this is where I believe the fundamental core of the concept comes in. \n\nIf the Hunter civilization is going to assume that...\n\n1. This other civilization will do anything it can to survive \n2. This other civilization will need the same resources their own does\n\nThen also need to assume that a  civilization that is advanced enough to broadcast out a message far enough that it doesn't degrade is also advanced enough to have come up with the Fermi Paradox and presumably the Dark Forest. \n\nSo how does the hunter know the caller is by the white birch tree (i.e. how does the hunter civilization know that the caller civilization is telling the truth). Maybe the caller is 50 ft from the white birch tree watching to see what happens. When they see the hunter's gun flash (i.e. they detect an attack on the location they broadcast, they may be able to trace back where it came from) And even if they can't or if it came from a space ship of some kind they now know that...\n\nA. There's another civilization out there\n\nB. It's hostile to other life\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the complicated business of other civilizations in the Dark Forest. What happens if there's another advanced civilization close by that thanks to the attack knows the Hunter civilization is where it is? \n\nSo if you were the hunter and you heard a voice call out, would you fire? Or just stay silent. I don't know if the Dark Forest is the solution to the Fermi Paradox, but if it is true I believe that the Forest is dark and quiet because no one ever calls out and if they do, they're never answered... at all.",

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 11th, 2022\n\nToday‚Äôs the day we find out if Orion‚Äôs fancy heat shield works. This is the part of the mission that was so dangerous that NASA didn‚Äôt want real people aboard Orion. Now we‚Äôve got five. \n\nI‚Äôm back to being this quantum function, both alive and dead at the same time, just waiting to be observed to determine my state.\n\nI decided to write this entry before we re-enter. You‚Äôll know what‚Äôs become of me from the news, and this is the moment to end this diary. The more I think about things, the more I feel I‚Äôve been thinking about life wrong. \n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter what happens next.\n\nGood luck, or shitty luck, however those quantum functions resolve, I‚Äôm not some particle with either an up-spin or a down-spin waiting to be observed. The Alex Whelm who had shitty luck and didn‚Äôt get accepted to astronaut training is the same Alex Whelm who pulled off an impossible intercept and spoke with the President of the United States. \n\nWhat I‚Äôve done are just the details of some combination of opportunity, luck, and means. They‚Äôre not who I am. I‚Äôm every thought in my head whether that‚Äôs from something I watched, something I read, or something that popped into my head and made me laugh at random. I‚Äôm the imprint in an old pair of my shoes. I‚Äôm a voice.\n\nMaybe that voice goes and does great things, maybe that voice goes and does nothing, but it‚Äôs the same voice no matter what.\n\nI‚Äôm the same Alex who realized he could sneak aboard Artemis I and saved Dragon‚Äôs crew, but I‚Äôm also the same Alex who skipped a VR gaming session and just kept working his job at NASA.\n\nWhy didn‚Äôt things work out with Jess? Because we weren‚Äôt right for each other. There was nothing wrong with me, there was nothing wrong with her, we just didn‚Äôt fit. What about Sarah? Who knows.  Once we‚Äôre down on the ground though, and I‚Äôve had a chance to shave, shower, and brush my teeth, I‚Äôll ask her if she‚Äôd like to go mountain biking together some time and get my ass kicked. We probably won‚Äôt fit either, and that‚Äôs ok. \n\nBut I know enough about myself to know that I‚Äôm a person who asks a girl out even when he thinks it‚Äôs hopeless. But her saying yes, or no, isn‚Äôt something I need to know the answer to in order to be happy or know who I am. There will be a time to ask, and I will. This just isn‚Äôt it.\n\nMaybe the heatshield fails, maybe we all burn up on re-entry. Or maybe I land and spend the next two months doing endless interviews as the big damn hero. But I‚Äôm still just Alex, the same guy who got rejected for his dream job and dumped by his girlfriend.\n\nWe spend so much time judging ourselves by what we‚Äôve done and how luck turned out, that we fail to see the person under it all. We see celebrities who are only exceptionally lucky, or have an exceptional talent at one thing, and transmute them into omnipotent beings. They‚Äôre not, I‚Äôm not. \n\nSo take it from the quantum entangled versions of a guy who both saved the lives of four people stranded in space, who saved the Orion mission from a critical computer glitch; and at the same time from the guy who snuck aboard a ship he had no business being on, and then changed absolutely nothing because that ship burned up on re-entry. Hero, and loser, at the same time, at the same moment, the outcome to be decided by forces outside of my control. \n\nNone of that stuff matters. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs ok that it be decided by a roll of the dice. What matters isn‚Äôt how things turn out, what matters is who we are, what we try to do, and how we try to do it.\n\nSo fate, chance, god, quantum entanglement, whatever you want to call it: do what you must, I‚Äôm good.\n\n\\*\n\nSad the story‚Äôs over? Want more? I‚Äôm Nathan H. Green a corporate lawyer who left his firm job of 8 years to write. It has been a hell of a journey for me and in the last two years I‚Äôve put out three full length novels, a novella, and Artemis I Has A Stowaway. \n\nFollow me on reddit (u/authornathanhgreen) for updates about what comes next and, buried at the bottom of my posts is a free audio drama time travel story. \n\nIf you want to get really wild, check out one of my books! Woe to the Victor came out last week and is getting amazing reviews.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI‚Äôm Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I‚Äôm going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission. You can follow along through my reddit (u/authornathanhgreen). \n\nArtemis I Has A Stowaway is a work of semi-fiction. All incidents, events, dialogue and sentiments (which are not part of the mission‚Äôs official history), are entirely fictional. Where real historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, sentiments, and dialogues concerning those persons are entirely fictional and are not intended to depict actual events, personality, disposition, or attitudes of the real person, nor to change the entirely fictional nature of the work. Save the above, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.\n\n¬© 2022 Nathan H. Green",

        "text": "In my universe, it takes place on a parallel Earth call Universe 153, that has a much more different historical backgrounds. First we start with the Titanic. The ship didn't crash, because the looks outs brought a pair of binoculars with them, to see the vast ocean, which thanks to him, spotted the iceberg saving the Titanic in the nick of time. Passengers made it to New York, while the ship is either preserved or scrapped decades later, and all the brilliant minds start to influence the world. Jumping a few decades later the space race happens early, and humanity enters an early retrofuture world influence by the brilliant minds from the Titanic. Isaac Asimov chose to not to be a writer and instead becomes a physicists who is the first pioneer in advance computer science after earning his degree psychics and engineersing instead of chemistry. He developes the first-ever positronic brain and later the first artificial intelligence programming the three laws into it. By then things went until, something happens. In the 1955 the robots started go crazy, and began to rebel against humanity, as the artificial intelligence started to develop a different interpretation of the three laws, as it saw how humanities \"independent ways\" made them a danger to themselves now. It decided that in order to protect humanity, all humans have to be placed in containment. They started to gather numerous humans from various megacities from around the world and freezing them cryogenic storage as a way to \"protect them from death and themselves\" while eliminating the rest of humanity leaving no human resistance left to stop them. Soon after they're finish the robots rebuild the world, and make it their own image.",
