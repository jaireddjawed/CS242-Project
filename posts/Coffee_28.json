It sounded like it was working, but just dumped a wet grinds 'cake' in the tray, if that makes sense.\n\nI'm reasonably handy with fixing stuff so I ordered a seal kit from Germany, but didn't think as far as needing a manual!\n\nI couldn't find any maintenance guides online, so I'm hoping someone here knows of a suitable seal replacement guide? I have a feeling the machine might share it's 'brew unit' with other machines, but I don't know if that helps at all?\n\nThanks for any help, much appreciated",

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nI'm reluctant to post this in case I get backlash or name-calling, but I am just so frustrated. \n\nI cannot make espresso/lattes at home using a home coffee machine. \n\nI've had 3 machines over the past decade, the last two I've had I ended up selling out of frustration. (Can't remember the first but it was an entry level Italian single boiler, then I did a Breville double boiler, now I'm onto a Smeg and use a Breville Smart Grinder) After I got my first machine I took an afternoon Barista course and found it easy on the machines at course. \n\nMy problem at home is: my coffee is always bitter or sour. I drink  a latte or a cappuccino.  I am not a coffee snob. I enjoy a chocolately/non bitter espresso in a lot of milk. I do not care about notes etc or enjoy particularly fancy brews - as long as it isn't bitter. \n\nHere is what I've tried:\n\nFresh beans from local coffee roaster where the beans are locally roasted\n\nSupermarket beans\n\n3 different machines\n\nA scale for my coffee\n\nDifferent grind sizes, tamp pressure and packing amounts\n\nDeep cleaning my machine\n\nIt takes me 10 -  15 minutes to make a coffee at home and results in SO much mess (grinds everywhere, drips of espresso all over the machine, etc) and the results are almost always so awful that I pour  a quarter cup of coffee syrup into my mug. \n\nEvery time it feels like  something different - my puck is too wet, my espresso is pouring too fast, too slow, one side is blocked, my puck is too dry, etc. I can go from using the same beans, the same dose and the same grind and get a completely different result. The coffee I'm drinking now is so bitter and sour it tastes like dirt. \n\nI appreciate this is a sub-reddit for people who enjoy this as a hobby and are passionate about making coffee.

That's been hard to find.  I see that [Kyocera makes a ceramic-lined travel mug](https://www.amazon.com/Kyocera-Interior-Insulated-Stainless-Mug-Matt/dp/B071LLSWXK/ref=sr_1_31?crid=VKEDJ2D9YC2E&amp;keywords=kyocera&amp;qid=1674857727&amp;sprefix=kyocera%2Caps%2C592&amp;sr=8-31&amp;th=1) - do you have experience with that?  What do you recommend?  I'm considering anything that keeps coffee warm for a long time, and has glass or ceramic contact surfaces. \n- For my drinking mug, I've been using [double-wall glass like these](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=double+wall+glass+coffee+mugs&amp;crid=1NPZO2DVNDM4C&amp;sprefix=double+wall+%2Caps%2C240&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_12), which are great, but I'm looking around for something a bit less fragile.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling fancy, I'll pre-warm a [thick-walled glass mug](https://www.amazon.com/Duralex-Picardie-Glass-Tumblers-Polishing/dp/B081GC86LK/ref=sr_1_14?crid=2ZH7ZLKZIIBMQ&amp;keywords=duralex+glass&amp;qid=1674858249&amp;sprefix=duralux+glass+cups%2Caps%2C208&amp;sr=8-14) for coffee, but they cool a bit too fast.  Again, I would love something with good insulation (again, double wall, thick ceramic, or something similar) with glass or ceramic contact surfaces.  What do you use?  Any suggestions?  \n\nWhat do you think?  Are there any drinking containers you think I should check out?  \n\nThanks for your suggestions!",

Weirdly enough, I'm introducing a new concept to Los Angeles which around 50% of the business is about coffee itself. It is half of a coffee shop. Now I'm not aiming to get the World's Best Espressos, but I am trying to do good enough to not get a ton of negative Yelp reviews. I'd like to aim of course to the closest as possible to the best, but the issue at hand here is budget. I have a relatively low budget of $2,500 for the machine itself. That being said, what machine would you guys be able to recommend to me. Looking for a capacity of 10-15 drinks per hour.\n\nAnother question, don't hate me, as I don't know anything about this world, what type of beans would you recommend that is good priced. I'm not looking to cheap out on the beans, but I'm also not looking to spend $5 per cup. I highly appreciate everyone's help, even if it's little. Thank you guys!",

This works great for other bags such as Olympia Big Truck, Olympia Morning Sun, Onyx Power Nap, and Stumptown Holler Mountain. I also use my Cafelat Robot and Chemex from time to time - these come out well, too.\n\nWith this bag, it's just so far off from the other stuff I brew I'm not sure where to begin. If I make it too coarse, the coffee gets weak without improving. I had a similar experience with Just Coffee Skate Perk a month ago - just couldn't make it work in Aeropress or Chemex. One thing I did notice about these two bags - the beans were significantly easier to grind than the others.",

        "text": "I've come full circle really. I started off my fresh (ish) coffee journey about 15 years ago using a French press with pre-ground coffee. I bought an espresso machine (Gaggia Baby) and a grinder and started making espresso. French Press became my inferior alternative when either my machine was broken (which is was often) or I was away from home. FP always tasted muddy and muddled and bitter. Didn't really reveal much about the bean.\n\nIn the past couple of years I've gone through an intense espresso journey. I've really started to pay attention to my technique and my beans, and I've made leaps and bounds. I've realised a lever machine is the one for me, and in the past year or so I've made some of the best espressos I've ever tasted.\n\nI then fell in love with pourover and really started concentrating even harder on the beans. Working out what I liked and seeking out local roasteries I can converse with and buy and sample coffees in their prime. I realised that espresso is indeed not the be-all and end-all, and to me actually much more enjoyment can be got from a carefully prepared pourover.\n\nThen I started reading about the \"immersion is better than percolation\" stuff and read James Hoffman's FP method. I found a single-cup (10oz) FP at work, a metal one with thermal walls. I tried the method, and by jove it's even better than pourover. Most mornings now I will make a French Press first thing in the morning, then attempt to better it mid-morning with my Hario V60, and every time I prefer the French Press.\n\nI find with the French Press it's simply an intrinsically more reliable and less error-prone method. The coffee is always, always extracted with intensity, body and the right level of acidity for the particular roast, and next to zero bitterness. This eben applies to less-than-perfect beans, i.e. ones off the supermarket shelves.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, it can be bad. At work someone will regularly make a huge jug of french press, evidently all wrong. It's bitter above anything else and at the same time lacking any kind of richness or subtlety. So I guess it all comes down to technique, I've gone from using the wrong technique, and thinking French Press was possibly my least favourite method, to finding the right technique and reaching the conclusion that I don't think I can better it as a method of extraction.",

I'm debating between getting the 1Zpresso JX-Pro or the Comandante C40 MX4. I'm living in the Netherlands, and as far as I could see, the cheapest I could get a 1Zpresso JX-Pro for is 185 euros. In comparison, the Comandante is about 230 to 240 euros. \n\nI am leaning more towards 1Zpresso for the reasons that it's slimmer (I've got small hands), a bit easier to dial in (I feel like I would need Red Cliks (adding another 40 euros) if I'd buy the Comandante) and thus somewhat cheaper. However, I've also been hearing that Comandante is THE manual grinder to have and offers a slightly better-tasting cup of coffee (I'm also questioning if I even have a palate refined enough to appreciate this difference). I'm planning on using the grinder for pour-over, the French press and the Moka pot. Keeping in mind that I'm a total newbie, which one would you advise I should get? Would the Comandante be worth the extra money?",

I'm tempted to buy the Oxo 8 cup, as it seems to do everything I need at a way cheaper price point than the Breville. However, I'm always adjusting my temps with the Aeropress - around the 190 range for medium, and way down around 170 for dark. Is this something I'd need to be concerned about with the Oxo and its lack of adjustable temps? Or is that more of a factor for immersion methods such as Aeropress? Thanks in advance!",

On the other hand, I never did that for coffee processed any other way, including anaerobic washed. I also started removing chaff at the same time that I started removing quakers and other bad beans from my coffee. \n\nIn addition, I am curious as to what the effect, or lack thereof, would be for coffees with big, loud flavors like boozy anaerobic naturals, and how big a difference it would make for coffees more than 3 weeks after the roasting date.\n\nSo, does chaff affect coffee flavor? Do bad beans affect it more? Does either make a bigger difference for coffees with more subtle flavors like washed coffees?",

I have a dream of opening a cafe myself one day but currently work in tech full time. It‚Äôs a dream of mine bc I love cafes, making coffee for people, and generally crave owning something of my own. I‚Äôd want my cafe to rly focus on coffee quality rather than just being a business.\n\nI can‚Äôt switch careers fully right now due to financial constraints. I part timed on the weekend for a bit but took a break when I moved. I thought I‚Äôd really want to part time again, and I kind of do, but I‚Äôm also unsure about the longevity of working 7 days a week (full time tech job on weekdays and part time barista job on weekends). \n\nI‚Äôm hoping to get some opinions. I‚Äôm unsure about committing to part time during the weekend because 1) I can burn out and end up doing poorly in both jobs, 2) I felt like I wasn‚Äôt learning as much as I could on the weekends since I don‚Äôt benefit from the repetition of learning during the week, and 3) this might be a lazy reason, but I do want to travel more this year so doing part time on the weekends is a blocker. \n\nI‚Äôd like opinions from y‚Äôall. Is part time at a cafe my only option? Are there other things I can maybe focus on with more flexible times? I‚Äôm in my late 20s right now and worry if I limit my options if I don‚Äôt get good enough by a certain age. \n\nOpen to any ideas and thoughts. TIA!",

Currently I'm looking at replacing it with a Moccamaster (seems bulletproof; people seem to like the coffee; maybe some concerns about coffee being underextracted) or a Ratio 6 (good warranty; sounds like it makes great coffee; has some annoying design choices for the carafe and brew basket). Butttttt was hoping to hear what you like and why y'all like it! Thanks in advance. \n\nStarting things off, what I really loved about the old Bonavita was that it was cheap when I got it and just made amazing coffee without having to do much. Things I loved less were that the company seems to be going through some turmoil, and the thermal carafe was a pain to clean. \n\n#",

For context, I do suffer from mental illness that plays into me being more paranoid and worried about these types of things, it's gotten a lot worse in the last couple years. I know from doing what research I could, there isn't really a 100% pure solution out there. I'm just hoping maybe someone who has thought about these things already could maybe recommend a mug that won't cause me to worry as much.\n\nI'll list below some of my concerns regarding specific materials:\n\n**Ceramics, Stone, Clay, Porcelain**: All seem to have coatings, paint, dyes or glazes applied to them and I worry these will overtime degrade and mix into my hot beverages.\n\n**Glass, Glaze:** While glass tends to be fairly clean, I worry a lot about tiny micro-shards of glass breaking off without my knowledge and especially from extreme temperature changes, even with borosilicate glass.\n\n**Stainless Steal, Copper, other metals:**  Many of these also seem to have different coatings applied to them, and even when they don't.. they tend to have micro-holes or craters in the metal which can hold bacteria, soapy water, or hardened beverages. They could even release micro-shards of the metal into the beverage and that concerns me.\n\n**Plastics:** Even with all the BPA-free stuff now days, I worry about plastics leaching into my hot beverages, and even though BPA is a concern.. there is many other concerning factors about ingesting all the compounds within plastic. Not too mention that it can give coffee a bad flavour. \n\nAnything to put my mind at ease would be appreciated. Also, if this isn't the right place to post this, please let me know a subreddit that might be more appropriate, I couldn't find another one that might be more suitable. Thank you.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not asking for medical advice, just inquiring about cleaner, safer products or information about current products.",

At the time the CC1 seemed to make sense, it offered a lot of great features for a reasonable price.  Within a year the steam boiler broke, that was fixed under warranty.  A short time later the steam wand started to leak, I had to pay to fix that.  Other leaks developed inside the machine.  I couldn't find any information on how to fix these leaks, and neither was I willing to deal with the expense and hassale of sending it back to the seller for repairs.  \n\nIn retrospect I probably should have gone with a machine that's both more established, with a wider user base and simpler design.  I almost always drink espresso with milk, so the steam quality is actually more important than the shot.  Looks like the Gaggia would fit the bill?  Does it have good reliability?  If something does break, is it easy to repair?  Easy to find parts?  Large community of users to support each other?",
