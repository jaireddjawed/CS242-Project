        "text": "Hey /r/math, so I proposed a (perhaps clumsily worded), question in /r/askphilosophy about the creation of the universe, that sort of arrived at a pure math question. I'll state the math question, dive into the philosophical context for anyone interested, and come back to some follow-ups.   \n\n\n**Question:** Imagine you have the map of what could be a stable fractal generation. I'm not sure I'm using the right terminology, but the black part in this image:\n\n[Part of a mandelbrot set \\(I think\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sdz9fxfv8uba1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7499ec6062bbe17cf835c10f0e2f136d4d7463c9)\n\n But you have no map of the outside of that fractal or any information about it.\n\nBased purely on it's shape, would you be able to  \n1) prove or disprove that it was a part of a fractal?\n\n2) prove or disprove that you're the top level in the fractal, or that your section of the fractal contains the origin (this may only be relevant to mandelbrot sets and not fractals as a whole)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the philosophical context for anyone interested:   \nHere's a [numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk) that I watched. While watching this, I sort of wondered about **if a particle or collection of particles was born into a universe that was a fractal generation, and bouncing around in a way similar to Mandelbrot's equations, and somehow gained sentience, would it be able to understand things about outside it's universe?** I phrased this in a bit of a sci-fi way [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10a4py8/has_anyone_in_philosophy_theorized_that_nature_is/), but lack both the math and philosophy background to really do the question justice.  \n\n\n**Bonus question:** I recall the Mandelbrot set was named \"The Thumbprint of God\". Was this related to what I'm talking about? Did Mandelbrot or other philosophers/mathemeticians inspired by his work come up with a similar theory?",

        "text": "Since I learned about the Lorenz attractor a couple of years ago, it has come to mean a lot to me personally. I'm seriously thinking about getting a tattoo of it before I graduate (with a math degree!) in May. But, it hasn't been easy to find pre-existing work that I like. I'm curious if anyone knows of any good math tattoos/artists I could use for inspiration (or to give to an artist as inspiration)...?\n\nHere's a neat figure from a random paper I found via google images ([reference](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/17/11/1520-0442_2004_017_2119_dpotao_2.0.co_2.xml)). I could legitimately see something like this (axes and all) inked onto my arm for the rest of my life. Thoughts? Any artists I could commission to enhance this or other work a bit?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1qfw7mfgqba1.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cba4188bd552cb73b171ae0c8e84ace764e408c5\n\nFor those interested in the Lorenz attractor, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAJkLh76QnM) provides a better explanation than I ever could.",

So he thought okay, its only one , my son can sell it. So he told his son to sell the chips in 50$ and went home. So after some time a group of 3 friends came. And they asked the price. So the son said its 60$. So they thought , okay so we each have to spend 20 bucks. We can do it. So they buy the chips and give the son 60bucks. So the son go home and told his father with joy that he managed to sell it in 60$. Now the father was an honest buisnessman. He scolded his son, and told him to give the guys back the extra 10$. So the son went to return the extra money. On the way, he saw a candy shop, and he thought what if i buy some candy, father dont have to know.\n\nSo he spend 4$. And returned the left which is 6$, to the guys.\n\nSo now\n\n1/ the chips cost 60$, each guy spent 60/3=20$\n\n2/ the son spent 4$, return 6$.\n\n3/ so each guy recieved 6/3=2$\n\n4/ now the spent for everyone is 20-2=18$\n\n5/ so they total spent 18+18+18=54$.\n\n6/ the son spent 4$\n\n7/ 54$+4$ =58$\n\nWhere the hell the other 2$ go???",

Note: this is NOT for career progression but for pure joy that I used to get while solving Math problems back in my engineering days. I have not touched another Math problem since then and that is basically where I am mentally when it comes to Math, so long story short, I need a book recommendation that would ease me back and not too complex that I abandon it quickly! Anyway, thought this would be a good place to ask! \n\nThanks",

        "text": "I've heard that in some contexts 2+2=5... But no one has explained that... So I asked an AI for a formal proof. This is what it gives me:\n\"A formal proof that 2 + 2 = 5 in a field with 5 elements:\n\nLet F = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} be a field with 5 elements, and let + and * be the operations of addition and multiplication, respectively.\n\nAssume that 2 + 2 = 5. We will show that this is a valid statement within the field F by verifying that it satisfies the axioms of a field.\n\nClosure: We need to show that 2 + 2 is an element of F. Since F = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, we have that 2 + 2 is an element of F, and thus 2 + 2 = 5 is a valid statement within F.\n\nCommutativity: We need to show that a + b = b + a for all a, b in F. Let a = 2 and b = 2. Then we have 2 + 2 = 2 + 2, which is true. Thus, the statement 2 + 2 = 5 satisfies the commutativity axiom.\n\nAssociativity: We need to show that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in F. Let a = 2, b = 2 and c = 1. Then we have (2 + 2) + 1 = 2 + (2 + 1) = (2 + 2) + 1.\n\nExistence of additive and multiplicative identity: We need to show that there exist elements 0 and 1 in F such that a + 0 = a and a*1 = a for all a in F. In this case we have:\n\n2 + 0 = 2\n2 * 1 = 2\nExistence of additive and multiplicative inverse: We need to show that for every a in F, there exists an element -a in F such that a + (-a) = 0 and for every non zero element a in F there exist a element a^-1 in F such that a * a^-1 = 1. for this case we know that for every element a in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, a + (a+1) = 0 (mod 5) and for every non zero element a in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} there exist a^-1 element such that a* a^-1 = 1 (mod 5)\nSince 2 + 2 = 5 satisfies all the axioms of a field, it is a valid statement within F, and we have proven that 2 + 2 = 5 is true in a field with 5 elements.\"\n\nOkay, is that true? Or is the AI like that Hollywood actor who wrote a proof that 1*2=3?",
