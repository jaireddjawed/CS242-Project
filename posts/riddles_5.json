It’s beautiful. \nRiddles are something extraordinary. They start small, typically first given to children, and they get their curious little minds thinking about our world. \nThey begin so simple, but as the creator grows, learns, and changes, the riddles do as well. They become something so beautiful. A whole n’other language.  \nA language of kennings and idioms, of murmurs and ideas that cannot be fully translated without deeper understanding, and eyes that read metaphor and see through symbol as if it were clear water. \n\nThey can be guileless and bring smiles, or they can be playful and sly. They can cause laughter, simple realizations, or deep thought. They can teach little facts, or get you to connect dots you wouldn’t have otherwise. They can be layered and esoteric, or they can be candid and artful. They can be so simple, yet so mystifying at the same time. They are without rules; without guidelines. They can be *anything*.\n\nI love them so Much. God, I love them. Riddles are the love of my life. I FREAKING LOVE RIDDLES.",

They had written an assortment of letters on a whiteboard and the answer was using the sounds of the letters to make each word in a conversation. I can visualise parts of it but not enough to piece it together.\n\nIt went something along the lines of \"how many fish are there in the ___ there are lots of fish in the __\" blanking on it but it was along those lines.\n\nAny help much appreciated 🙂",
