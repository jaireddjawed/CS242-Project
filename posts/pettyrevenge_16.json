The listing also claimed it had several digital games installed like Mario Kart, Mario 3D World and other AAA games. I messaged the seller, who agreed to meet me at a mall, and I got there early. I also negotiated it down to $15, since that was all the cash I had at the time, and he said fine. \n\nAnyway, he messaged me telling me he arrived and was waiting in the mall parking lot. I headed outside and approached his car; he was with another guy and they were both sitting in the front. I gave him the cash and he handed me the 3DS in a case through the window, then he drove off. As I was walking back to the mall, I tried turning the 3DS on. It didn't power on. So I figured, alright maybe the battery just needs to be charged. I headed to the mall's GameStop and the clerk kindly let me use a 3DS charger to charge it. It still didn't work. The thing was truly dead.\n\nI opened Letgo and messaged the seller, telling him the 3DS wouldn't turn on. He just said, \"yep it's dead\" then blocked me. I was outraged, since the guy told me it worked, only to scam me. I knew I just had to get back at him somehow. I opened the Letgo app again, but this time I made another account, pretending to be someone else. I went to the scammer's seller page, and saw he had one other item for sale: a green-tinted glass bong. Then I had an idea.\n\nI messaged him again, posing as someone else, and told him I'd offer him double the price he listed the bong for (I think around $20) but only if he'd meet me at an outlet mall in another city 32 miles away. He eagerly agreed. Of course I didn't actually meet him there. About a half-hour later, the guy sent me several messages telling me he arrived, asking where I was, etc. I didn't respond. He then sent me a bunch of curse-laden messages calling me a \"piece of shit\" and whatnot for making him waste all that gas only to not show up. I replied with \"That's what you get for selling me a broken 3DS you fucking scumbag!\" revealing who I was, then signed out. I also ended up selling that 3DS on eBay for parts for about $40.\n\nI'm the last person you want to scam.",

        "text": "So I'm a finance manager at a small dealership. Recently my job has been harder than normal with rates becoming more of a pain-point with customers. I get it though, I pride myself on not being one of those finance managers who slap a bunch of nonsense warranties at the end of the car deal. So for the most part, I feel like someone who looks out for someone's best interest in my office.\n\nYesterday morning I mentioned to my other co-worker that I would take a small lunch break at 11:30, but I would return in about thirty minutes. I was really hungry so I ran back to my office to grab my keys, but found a deal jacket containing customer information on my desk. I walked up front and lo and behold we actually had customers. I messaged my co-worker and told her that I would go ahead and forgo lunch for the time being.\n\nThe customer mentioned that they wanted to go 72 months and finance the full amount without any money down. As I'm going through their application I find that they make about 50K a month and have very low debt to income. I prepare the paperwork and decide to go with our captive lender, who's current rate would be around 9 percent. However, I sent it off to another lender who I knew would have a much lower rate if I could get it approved.\n\nI always go and talk with the customer before I bring them back to my office so I go see what they were about and introduce myself. Nice couple, I thought. I told them the high rate that I approved them at, but mentioned that I was waiting on another bank to give them a better deal. He smiled at me and said that his own bank could do 6.99 percent. Reminder that I was pretty hungry, so I told them that I would check on that and get back to them in about 5 minutes.\n\nI found a better rate! In fact I found that I could easily match what their lender could do and still make some money on the rate for myself. I happily went out to the showroom floor with my good news and he immediately smiled and pulled out his phone. He told me that he wanted to text his banker and see if she could get a lower rate than 6.99. She responded that she could in fact get 6.89 percent. \n\nOkay...I get it, we are playing this game now. I immediately said, that since we agreed to give them $2,000 dollars more for their trade-in that I would go ahead and sell them the vehicle at the floor rate of 6.49 percent. I hate going back and forth and I knew I would be so far under what \"his\" bank could do that it would be a no-brainer and I could run home and eat. He smiled at me and said that his own bank might could do even better. Turns out they couldn't do better though.\n\nAt this point I had a showroom full of other people that were trying to secure financing. I told him if he financed with us, I would get the floor manager to give him another $500. He told me that would be great, but he needed a little bit to discuss matters with his wife.\n\nAfter a few minutes he told me that he was just going to take the higher interest rate with his bank and that he only negotiated with me to get a better rate at his bank. He told me, it wouldn't have mattered what rate I worked to get him, he was always going to his own bank. This was a bit frustrating, being that I had spent the better part of 2 hours going back and forth with this couple to not have them finance with me.\n\nHowever, I told him we would have to have a draft from his bank or funds in our account to proceed with letting them take the vehicle home with them. They had driven about 2 hours from where they were from. He told me that his bank would only wire the funds to our account so I gave him our wire instructions and had him sign a few documents with me. I told the couple though, that I didn't think the banks would transfer the funds so late in the day, being that it was after 2:00pm at this point. He told me that his bank works faster than most and that we would have the funds in a few hours.\n\n2 hours later and the money wasn't in our account yet. **Here's my petty revenge though**. I told him that I've seen funds show up sometimes even after 6:00pm. Him and his wife waited around for another 4 hours in our showroom for me to go up to them at six and let them know that we never received it. They went home empty handed and had to return the next day to pick it up. I was very apologetic to them, but I was grinning on the inside.",

One of us climbed over the gate to see if we had somehow arrived at the back of the campsite, only to be chased out by a balding middle aged man who shall henceforth be dubbed MrAngry. MrAngry spent the next 15 minutes shouting and swearing at the three of us, whilst the spittle sprayed and his face turned red. My brother got actually really rattled by the experience, and my mum is definitely a MamaBear, hence the petty revenge.\n\nEventually we found the campsite without his help, and the campsite owners said that yes he was a bit feisty and told us his name and a few other helpful details. This allowed us to google stalk him, and find his address!! \n\nFor the next four months we sent him cheery postcards with pretty pictures, including advice for his blood pressure, infuriating self help quotes (such as \"Life is too short to sweat the small stuff\") and reminders to try and calm down.\n\nWe even sent him a birthday card...",

        "text": "I wanna add that this revenge was held back in 6th grade.\n\nOne simple morning, I was sitting during ELA. I had a mean popular girl in my class, let‚Äôs call her A. A always used to critique how hyper I was. She used to discuss with her friends how jumpy I was, told me to stop moving my hands (when I wasn‚Äôt making any noise) and basically did everything she could to annoy the shit out of me. \n\nShe did this to my best friends too, one had diagnosed inattentive ADHD and the other had a speech impediment. A used to say how much my friend with ADHD, K, was annoying and would groan when ever thrown into a group with her. The same goes with my other friend, D. A talked about how she ‚Äúspoke weird‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat she had‚Äù.\n\nI decided that enough was enough, I‚Äôm gonna do whatever I want with her. All year I purposefully banged the table instead of lightly moving. I used my hand up super high, and I could see the scowl on her face when the teacher would instead call on me.\n\nOne day, I recall, I had an hour and a half math class. We were solving some pretty tough questions. Of course, A just had to be in my group. We had this activity where each team would have a giant whiteboard, and try to solve a math question as quick as possible. I couldn‚Äôt mentally handle A so I just sat back while she did some of the work. This wasn‚Äôt really budging her, and I know this wasn‚Äôt exactly getting revenge for my mistreated friends. So after the class was close to an end, the whole whiteboard was colored and embroidered imd her shitty handwriting. \n\nI decided this was my time to strike. So, I grasped the eraser and erased all her work. The several equations that helped her find the answer were gone. All her progress was gone, nothing except little marker shavings. This was the funniest shit I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life, so much so that I had already figured out the question in my head and wrote it out, nothing but my two explanations were on the board, and then the teacher walked over. I particularly participate in a lot of activities, so she recognized my handwriting. I remember the stupid worry on A‚Äôs face when my teacher looked back at her. \n\nTurns out she had to spend the entire lunch and recess, and some extra time after school to explain why she didn‚Äôt do any work and redo multiple math problems. Luckily, when A had proclaimed the truth, all the teachers didn‚Äôt believe her and we were called in to discuss with each other. Nobody believed A, and I got to brag to my parents about this and A never really bothered us for the rest of the school year. \n\nTL:DR, girl was being rude and ableist, so I ruined all her work and got her into trouble. \nMaybe this wasn‚Äôt enough, but I thought this story was pretty good.",

I kept saying no but she kept bullying me and started saying how bad it looked, it was uneven, I was going to look stupid in my pictures, etc. \n\nWell I wasn‚Äôt very confident at that stage and started getting self conscious and so I caved. I let her cut my hair but I told her to only trim the bottom and she couldn‚Äôt touch the hair around my face that was a bit shorter than the rest. \n\nShe trims the bottom and I think we‚Äôre done but then she really fast takes the scissors and cuts a big chunk off the hair along the side of my face. Essentially turning it into bangs. I freak out, start panicking, meanwhile my sister says it‚Äôs fine that she can fix the other side. I‚Äôm sure you know where this is going but to get it even she had to keep going shorter and shorter on each side because it was never quite matching up. \n\nAfter the fact, I was devastated. I was basically a shell of a human switching back and forth between sad and angry tears. A day or so later I was staring at myself in the bathroom mirror when I just looked down at her toothbrush. I grabbed it. And then my eyes went to the toilet. And then back to the toothbrush. And then I did it. I cleaned the toilet with my sister‚Äôs toothbrush. I scrubbed under the brim, along the sides, no part of the bowl untouched. And then I put it back in the holder on the counter. \n\nFor weeks and months every time I went to the bathroom I looked at that toothbrush and felt a rush of satisfaction.  Even long after my hair grew out and was fixed. I never told a living soul what I did because I wanted her to use that toothbrush for as long as possible. \n\nI kept that secret for more than 15 years. My sister was so pissed when she found out what I did but I have no regrets. It helped me heal from the worst haircut of my life. And thus, my story of petty revenge.",

Fast forward to the school season and we were playing the school that the select coach‚Äôs kid was on.

But when he got to us, he stepped directly in front of us and stayed there, no friends waiting for him. We couldn‚Äôt see the performance, and he had a few pre-concert drinks so he was a bit obnoxious already and getting side eyed by the crowd around him. After almost two hours of waiting this guy took our view away. So, instead of confronting him, I chewed gum, one piece at a time, and threw it down on the ground where he was dancing. His fancy shoes eventually had 15 pieces of chewed gum stuck to the bottom - his frustration was palpable - and he left to go take care of it. We never saw him again.

        "text": "Context: So I (18f a senior in high school) jacked up the tendon by my thumb on my left hand. I have absolutely no idea how it happened but it‚Äôs been screwed up for about 3 days now. I can‚Äôt write (I‚Äôm a leftie) or pic up my own damn backpack because it hurts too much. I called an urgent care that comes to your house and they took a look, after they wrapped me up they told me not to write (since I hold pens/pencils in such a way that it‚Äôs impossible to write without using my thumb) or lift things with my left hand due to the pain. They wrote me a note for that to give to my school. This morning I gave the note to my school nurse and they made a copy for them to keep plus sending out an email to all my teachers about the issue.                                            Now the real story: I showed up to my first period and showed my note to my algebra teacher (I‚Äôll call Mr.J). Mr.J didn‚Äôt even read it and said ‚ÄúLook I believe you BUT I need you to try your best in doing the work since you need to do it.‚Äù I can‚Äôt even write with my right hand since it‚Äôs practically illegible for anyone to read. I understandably got a little pissed off but I‚Äôm not exactly good at confrontation with teachers so I left to my desk and tried to write notes with my class. God it was awful, I felt the pain a little after 5 minutes and I kept having to stop. I told Mr.J my hand hurts and he just kept saying ‚ÄúDo your best.‚Äù So I went to the bathroom and told my mom what was up and she told me to go to the nurse to get some pain meds. I did so and I told the nurse was was up. Let me tell you, SHE WAS PISSED. She even sent that email (which I saw was open on his computer at his desk!!!) and when I told her he still tried to make me write and that he didn‚Äôt even look at the note and got even more pissed off. She then got a sticky note and wrote ‚ÄúNO WRITING!! This student will NEED have someone else wrote for her PER HER DOCTORS INSTRUCTIONS!!! Which is in the note she has shown you.‚Äù I was sent back and I gave him that note. He was absolutely flabbergasted, he looked at the note, me, the note, and again. I tried so damn hard not to laugh at his face but I just gave him a smug ass look as to say ‚ÄúI told ya so you dumb motherfucka.‚Äù This dude is usually very stoic and don‚Äôt show emotion often, but seeing him panic was the highlight of my day. Me then made me take a picture of the notes and didn‚Äôt make me worry about the homework. I know it‚Äôs not exactly juicy but I just call it a small victory on my part. (Note: Everything in that class is on paper. Mr.J didn‚Äôt even set up a google classroom so I was kinda fucked from the start) (Note2: It‚Äôs kinda ironic since his whole classroom thing is treating his students like adults yet he treats me like a damn child playing boy who cried wolf üòë)",

        "text": "Crossposted from another group after being told it belonged here. TL;DR at the bottom. It‚Äôs a read, but worth it. ü§£\n\nThis was a hot minute ago‚Ä¶mid-to-late nineties. I was working evenings slinging coffee at a well-known international coffee chain (you know the one) while I finished my degree.\n\nThe coffee chain had just introduced a ***BRAND NEW*** blended frozen beverage that made all the baristas‚Äô lives a living hell. I still can‚Äôt drink the shit to this day‚Ä¶but it was pretty popular, especially with younger patrons.\n\nAs my location was right next to the only mall in the area, we were inundated by teenagers pretty regularly. Most were respectful and nice‚Ä¶except this *one* group of girls. They were there nearly every evening‚Ä¶not tipping, being loud and obnoxious af, making and leaving messes everywhere. We all despised them. When the new blended frozen drinks came out, the group of teenage succubi found a new, *improved* way to make our lives difficult. They would descend upon our location en masse‚Ä¶even bringing NEW nasty girls with them. They‚Äôd all order the blended frozen drink, but each order would be just a *liiiiiiiiittle* bit different. This would ensure that we could only make one drink at a time in the ONE BLENDER we had. The little slogs would even lean over the counter and monitor us to make sure every one of their drinks were EXACTLY made to specification and to ensure we ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt screw it up.‚Äù \n\nThe girls had also picked up the *lovely* new habit of staying past closing. Rules of the coffee chain (at that time) were that we couldn‚Äôt ask anyone to leave after we closed. We could start cleaning duties‚Ä¶even turning some lights off here and there‚Ä¶but we couldn‚Äôt be like, ‚Äúhey, we‚Äôre closing‚Ä¶can you take your beverage outside?‚Äù Dumb rule, but most people would see us starting to shut down and head for the door.\n\nNot the succubus brigade. Ohhhhh NO. Their ‚Äúleader‚Äù confronted one of my coworkers one night as he swept and mopped near them, roughly 15 minutes past closing. ‚ÄúYOU CAN‚ÄôT ASK US TO LEAVE MY AUNT IS A MANAGER AT (coffee chain) SO I KNOW.‚Äù Dude hadn‚Äôt even acknowledged them. This wasn‚Äôt an everyday occurrence, but believe me when I say we were DOOOOOOONE.\n\nAbout two or so weeks after they‚Äôd confronted my coworker, I was closing. Had one other person with me, and I had volunteered to close the front of the store. The Mean Girls were camped out in their usual corner. I started wiping down tables. I heard giggling and looked in their direction. They had knocked a piece of coffee cake on the floor. Crumbs were EVERYWHERE. Not only this, but they were ALL LOOKING AT ME AND SMIRKING and the ringleader shrugged and said ‚Äúoops!‚Äù\n\nI was fucking done. \n\nI finished wiping down the tables while I formulated my plan. I ducked behind the counter and motioned for my coworker to join me in the back. I told her my plan, grabbed a mop, and moved back behind the counter near the flavored syrups. I poured a nice amount of raspberry syrup into my mouth and headed back into the general vicinity of the flock of biznatches.\n\nAfter a few moments of totally inconspicuous mopping, I lurch toward the girls clutching my abdomen, with a terrified look on my face. This is quite successful in diverting their attention toward me. Exactly what I want.\n\nAfter I make a few more puke-like lurches, I spew forth the raspberry syrup all over the floor. It went EVERYWHERE and looked like I had vomited blood.\n\nTo say that they freaked out would be an understatement. A collective high-pitched screech rose up from the group as they grabbed their purses and scrambled for the door. Drinks were spilled. One girl tripped and fell. Chairs were knocked over. It surpassed my highest expectations.\n\nIt. Was. ***GLORIOUS***.\n\nThey were still scrambling around the parking lot and crying as I calmly walked to the door and locked it, with my coworker laughing hysterically in the background. We started cleaning up the absolute (worthwhile) mess‚Ä¶still falling out‚Ä¶as they silently watched for a few moments before piling into three cars and leaving.\n\nNever heard anything from management. Never got written up. ***NEVER*** saw those girls again. Will forever be remembered as the single greatest event in my retail career.\n\nTL;DR - a gaggle of rude-ass teenage girls loses a game of ‚Äúfuck around and find out.‚Äù",

I‚Äôve been a restaurant server, and work in a location where I make far more money than the average waiter.\n\nIn high school I dated a young woman from a problematic family. A LOT of drama ensued from her parents reacting to our relationship. This spread around town.\n\nWhen my ex and I were breaking up, I befriended a freshman girl she was in Band with. Said freshman girl was obviously into me, and that felt good to be around even though I knew our age difference was problematic, being that I was eighteen and she was fifteen. But at that age it‚Äôs a lot easier to lie to yourself about your intentions and what you‚Äôre doing.\n\nShe and I got kinda close, but her family (understandably) put a stop to it.  She and I messaged back and forth for a while before it stopped entirely. \n\nA few years later I ran into her at college (I was a fuck-up at the time and doing poorly). The exchange was bad on my part. I didn‚Äôt say anything aggressive to her, I was just very narcissistic and out-of-touch with reality. \n\nI saw her once more a few weeks later at a Taco Bell. She inched by me with a look on her face like she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, so I took the hint and just waved and smiled. That was probably eight to eight and a half years ago.\n\nCut to now in the restaurant I work at. I‚Äôve been working all day, and look up to see what I think is her face across the bar. She‚Äôs wearing glasses now, but she looks the same otherwise. I see her notice me, and get visibly uncomfortable. So I pretend to keep about my business, and mostly ignore her (and her mom).\n\nShe takes off her glasses at one point. Now I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs her.\n\nBefore I leave I arrange to pay for everything she and her mom got. I tell my bartender co-worker to tell them when they ask for the check that one of his co-workers went to high school with her and picked up the tab.\n\nI leave after my shift is over. \n\nWhile walking along the street, I can‚Äôt help to look as I‚Äôm walking by, and she‚Äôs looking at the same time.\n\nSuch a cool experience that I want to tell my girlfriend, but I know she‚Äôd probably get upset lol.",

        "text": "not my story, posting for a friend who doesnt \"reddit\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n1. TL;DR ISP fucked me over a ¬£93 bill, i did everything i could for our HOA to swap ISP so they lose out on \\~¬£3200/month in income  \n2. Long story: Without giving off too much detail, Last year I moved to a new apartment complex, the HOA owning it had a deal with ISP1, ISP1 is one of the bigger ones in my country, the HOA deal was 250/250Mbit+a TV-package and IP-telephone for the price of ¬£19/mo (roughly), so it was a good deal, but me having gotten accustomed to 1000/1000Mbit from my old house decided to upgrade the speed for my apartment, and went up to 500/500 for an extra \\~¬£18/mo, after a quick call and confirmation with the ISP1 they had enabled it for me, all is well. Queue a few hours i did some speedtests, it was still stuck around 250/250, not thinking too much about it i decided to check later again. having the memory of a goldfish, and a complete lack of new movies/games coming out i didnt really download/upload alot of things and forgot about the speed, but after about 6months I was downloading all of total war: warhammer games, it took fucking -ages- and i checked the speed and saw i still had 250/250, despite having been billed the extra ¬£18 for 5months.  Queue a call to ISP1, 45minute queue until I finally got through and they couldnt see anything wrong and asked me to try tomorrow.  Next day: Same issue, call ISP1 again, another \\~40minute queue and me explaining my problem, the support person was super friendly and helpful, after about 1hour of troubleshooting they notice a problem: my account is only enabled for 250/250, NOT 500/500, after about 30seconds of fiddling it was now working and i had 500/500, and asked to be refunded for the past 5months of extra billing, and was told no can do, gotta transfer me to that department. \n3. now, anyone who's ever had to do with any larger organisation and their support know that this is where it starts. I got bounced around, I was told no, I spent hours in phone queues between this and that departmanent just to be transfered back to where i started, the whole shebang, after about 1¬Ω week of this with daily calls and \"the best offer\" being a 1month refund of ¬£18, I was tired. I told them I'd put in a declaration of conflict to \"ARN\" (basically, organization in sweden that handles conflicts betwen companies/people), it took about 45minutes after I did this declaration for a unknown number to call me, it was someone from one of the departments I had already spoken with, and apparantely my ticket had been handled by \"a junior who didn't know the routines\" (nevermind that i had spoke with about 20 different people, asking to speak with a senior tech/manager each call and being refused it) and **ofcourse** I can get a full refund for the 5months I had paid for a service, that they forgot to enable. so now i got a ¬£18 discount on each bill for the next 5 bills, problem solved and everyone is happy! (not)  Damage was already done, I was in full \"petty fuming mode\", I found out other HOA members were annoyed/dissapointed by our current ISP, and the contract had been cancelled pending a reneweal in 2023, i had about 9months to do this.  I joined our yearly meeting, raising my issues and experience with the ISP, gathering support by other HOA members at the meeting, and I evenetually said \"If no one else wants to do it, I can check for other options\", a majority supported the decision, the hunt is on.  I contacted a bunch of different ISP's, knowing which one I personally wanted (due to being the only one I had personally good experiences with), gathered offers from them all, sorting them out by quality/quantity and pricing, dealing against eachother and just being a general bastard, I am to get out on the other side with a profit from this.\n\n \n\n1. a few months of back/forth I had it narrowed down to 2 new contenders, and our current fucker, the ISP1, after multiple meetings with the HOA board, preempting every single complaint or worry they had about swapping, having thought about litereally every single thing they raised, and having a prepared answer from the NewISP I wanted and solutions to all the problems they foresaw, multiple meetings over weeks of them being afraid of making a decision, after newyears it finally happened.  I got the text. \"Anon, we have decided on going with your suggestion of swapping to NewISP\". The deal was on, 1000/1000Mbit+equivalent TVpackage and IP-telephony, for the glorious price of ¬£20/mo. (including a router+wifi bridge for full coverage in bigger apartments)  I finalize all the things that needs to be done, technicians will come out on site and measure and verify our apartments so that there isnt any hardware issues (bad cabling/placement of router/Accesspoints etc) so we all have as optimal enviroment we can to solve all the previous issues the old ISP1 never fixed.  The call to our contact with our old ISP1 was glorious, calling them up and explaining, We've decided to go in another direction, our goals doesn't align anylonger, its not us, its **you**, with your bad unfriendly support. And do you remember, that day, 10months ago when I called in, and asked for a ¬£90 refund because your technicians forgot to click a button to active a service, but remember to activate the billing for said service, and it couldnt be done? Well, I guess that ¬£90 refund ended up costing you a tad more then expected, have a nice day mate.  that ¬£90 bill ended up costing them a minimum of ¬£106 330 in income (as contracts had to be signed on a minimum of 3 years) probably spent about 90hours in total on getting all this done, time well spent! 10/10 would do again..there ya go, fixed typos and stuff, think i spotted it all üì∑ but thats basically the story",

        "text": "Im a transgender man, which means i was assigned female at birth but am transitioning to a man. Ive been on testosterone for about 6 months, and as a result, i have a deeper voice, facial hair, an adams apple, and generally just look like a teenaged boy (which is fine since im still 19) I rarely if ever get misgendered because im super tall, and most people dont even clock me as trans to begin with. Ive been working at my current workplace for about a year, long after i came out of the closet. My job heavily relies on me using experience as an ex-homeless queer youth to advocate for educational materials and humanitarian funding, so everyone is quite aware of the fact that i am trans, and most people are very kind and accepting, including both my bosses, who are wonderful ladies and have gone out of their ways to create an inclusive space for everyone. \n\nhowever, i ran into a small issue. A female coworker of mine didn't take kindly to me using the mens restroom, she brought it up with my boss after she saw me walk in one day. She said it made her uncomfortable, and that it was innapropriate for a \"girl\" to be in there. OK ma'am, we'll play this game. \n\nMy boss and i laughed about it, and she wanted to take action against the coworker that complained, but i figured there was a better way to handle this than letting some poor old lady lose her job in this economy. So, i started using the ladies room again. Tenor voice, facial hair and all, in my semi formal work attire (slacks, button up shirt, and blazer, usually) Coworker walks in with one of her friends that usually brings her lunch but doesn't work there, around the time im washing my hands, and her friend audibly gasps and backs out of the room. Coworker gives me a look then follows her friend. I leave without further incident. \n\nThe next day at work, my boss comes into my office obviously stifling laughter. Coworker's friend had gone directly to the director in our building to report a creepy man in the men's restroom...me. Coworker then had to explain to the DIRECTOR as to why the token trans kid had to use the ladies room to begin with, and was required to send me a very edifying apology email with the promise to cease all forms of harassment. She's not made eye contact with me since, and ive been able to shit in peace for the last couple weeks lmao\n\nthe moral of the story: if you hate letting trans men use the mens room, be prepared for some big hairy guys in the ladies room, cause \\*surprise!\\* some of us look like big hairy dudes! it may not be a massive or clever story, but i thought it was hilarious and ended quite well",

        "text": "Bit of back story:\n\nSo a fair number of years ago, when I was still dating my now exhusband, (Ex) was living with some friends of ours. Very nice people who opened their home up to him because he chose to live a rather transient lifestyle and needed a place to stay. They had also welcomed in several teenagers in need who went to the same school as their kids but had been kicked out of their parent's houses because of \"lifestyle differences\" (ie the kids were gay and their parents were a-holes). This was long enough ago that everyone involved is now an adult and no one suffered any permanent damage but fair warning I am a a-hole and I'm well aware, I'm also now old enough that I've mostly reached the \"I don't care about your expectations\" phase of my life.\n\nThe story:\n\nMy kid asked if we could go hang out at her friend's house after school and I didn't have work and I'd get to hang out with my friends and my boyfriend so I was more than happy to agree. She had bought just under a dozen fundraiser chocolate bars (I forget the exact number) with her own money and wanted to share one with her friends before the rest got divided up as gifts for the other people she wanted to give them to. Sweet kid, likes sharing. I asked my friend if we could put them in the fridge because it was super hot out and I didn't want them melting and spoiling her gifts so my friend said to put them in their garage fridge because \"they'll be safe there\". Ok sure.\n\nFast forward a few hours and we are getting ready to leave and all but 2 of the chocolate bars are missing. Stolen. Presumably by at least one of the teenagers in the house but I'm not the type to go accusing people without actual evidence. There wasn't any way to prove which teen had taken them or if there was more than one culprit but these were supposed to be mine and my kid's friends. You don't steal from friends, shouldn't steal at all but definitely not from the people in your crew. My kid was understandably upset and felt betrayed and I was livid that someone who claimed to be her friend stole from her, hurt her, lied to her and then tried to blame someone else (everyone was pointing fingers). \n\nI've already mentioned my a-hole nature, add vindictive to that. I'm also allergic to artificial sweeteners and Ex is a diabetic. So I did a little research and found which artificial sweetener has the most laxative effects and then found which types of sugar free candy/chocolate had the highest content of said sweetener.\n\nI bought 5 bags. Took the 2 grocery bags full of diabetic friendly candy to Ex and made sure that everyone in the house knew that these were Ex's candy because he can't have real sugar because of the diabetes and asked everyone, very nicely, to not eat any of Ex's candy. And then I waited.\n\nAll 5 bags were gone after 2 days, Ex had a couple pieces and the rest were all stolen. \n\nOh no!  This was an entirely unanticipated outcome! (sarcasm)\n\nOut of the entire household of 4 adults and 6-7 teenagers (I had trouble keeping track of which one was which) only the adults and 1 teen didn't end up suffering from massive amounts of diarrhea. Icing on the cake; the teens all shared the same single bathroom.",

Now there were 2 concerts that they both wanted to attend, one in October and one in January. Josh bought the tickets for the October one and Sarah bought the tickets for the January one. Not long after the October concert, their relationship broke down, the nail in the coffin being Sarah cheating on Josh. They weren‚Äôt on great terms after the break up but not terrible either. Sarah agreed that Josh could keep his ticket to the January concert as he‚Äôd paid for the October ones (standing tickets so it‚Äôs not like they would be seated next to each other). \n\nA few weeks before the concert it sells out. Shortly after this, Josh asked Sarah for the concert ticket but she told him that she had changed her mind and was now giving the ticket to her friend instead. Josh asked both her and the friend to not do this as it was unfair and the concert had now sold out. Sarah and her friend refused and Josh was mad and upset‚Ä¶ until he got to thinking that actually maybe Sarah had already emailed him the ticket. He frantically checked his emails and to his joy, found that she had actually sent the concert ticket to him months earlier. Additionally, this wasn‚Äôt a ticket with a name on it, so the first person to use it got it. \n\nJosh didn‚Äôt say a word and organised with a friend of his to attend the concert as soon as the doors opened, knowing that it would be unlikely that Sarah and her friend would do the same as the main act wasn‚Äôt on until a couple hours later. His plan was successful and 30 minutes before the main act started, Sarah messaged Josh angrily asking him if he‚Äôd used the ticket. In response, Josh sent a photo of him and his friend enjoying the concert. Ultimate petty revenge.",

        "text": "So, I worked at a certain job for five years. Thankfully, no longer there. When I started there was this employee, let‚Äôs call him Sam, who was at the same level as me. Sam was not the best employee. He would be on his phone constantly, find ways out of doing the work he didn‚Äôt want to to get the more fun jobs, and was the guy who peaked in high school as the football star and rode that high into his late 20s. Important to note, he was also friends with one of the head honchos at my job so it was no surprise that even though most of us thought he was a horrible employee, he somehow got promoted to shift supervisor.\n\nAs shift supervisor, he made life miserable. He‚Äôd disappear from the floor to do ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù and anytime I went to the bathroom (it was in the office) he would just be playing games on his phone or FaceTiming his girlfriend, not even having paperwork on the desk. And he‚Äôd be in there for HOURS, leaving the rest of us to struggle. He‚Äôd break policy consistently saying he could make those calls but yell at us for making the slightest mistake. When I asked for help on jobs too big for just myself he‚Äôd say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine‚Äù and go back to the office. Most people didn‚Äôt like him, except for the few staff he‚Äôd go party with. He‚Äôd threaten me with write ups for things that happened off my shift. He‚Äôd tell us to do stuff out of policy and if it went wrong would lie about giving us the orders and get us in trouble. He‚Äôd also spread rumors about employees. Anytime someone complained to higher ups, we were met with ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a great staff, that doesn‚Äôt sound like him, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not what happened‚Äù\n\nSo, I started getting real petty. I memorized the policy and procedure book. He asked me to do something slightly off policy, I‚Äôd ask for his permission in writing with his signature. Others saw and started doing the same. He‚Äôd get mad and do it himself. Suddenly, he was having to work. Eventually I just couldn‚Äôt stand his attitude and switched to the day shift (he‚Äôs the evening supervisor) so I‚Äôd only see him at shift change. \n\nSomehow, he still made things hard. He‚Äôd leave tasks incomplete the night before that we‚Äôd have to finish the next morning or we‚Äôd get in trouble. He was always late and due to my job needing a certain amount of people on floor at a time I never left less that 20 minutes late. But, that overtime caught a higher ups attention. I got called and questioned as to why I was ‚Äúmilking the clock‚Äù for OT by a higher up than Sam and told them it‚Äôs because of Sam‚Äôs lateness and told them to check the time sheets. They said they would and I was told to leave at the end of my shift no matter what. So I did. The evening shift couldn‚Äôt get anything done for the first 20 minutes due to short staffing and it threw off the whole shift. I was asked why all the day tasks weren‚Äôt getting done, I told them it‚Äôs because half our shift is used to get the evening shifts unfinished tasks done. I was told to only do day shift tasks. Evening shifts became chaos because of the piling on of unfinished tasks. It became so bad they couldn‚Äôt ignore the issue anymore.\n\nHere‚Äôs where it really kicked off though. One day I get pulled into a meeting with Hr and they are pissed. They tell me ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù saw me scratch Sam‚Äôs car with a key while leaving my shift the day before and it‚Äôs a fire able offense. Obviously I didn‚Äôt. I ask who said it and they just said ‚Äúnot Sam‚Äù. What they didn‚Äôt know was my supervisor on days gave me a ride home that day due to my car being in the shop and walked with me out to the parking lot. I told them so and requested they speak to that supervisor and said I would like to file a complaint against the employee who lied about me vandalizing property and almost getting me fired. They just said they‚Äôd handle it. Suddenly, two days later a note was sent out that Sam had ‚Äústepped down‚Äù from the supervisor position and he quit shortly after, always giving me a dirty look at shift change. I quit a week after.",

I was stupid and believed him.\n\n3 months later I found him cheating on me with a girl in another school. My friend showed me a pic of them making out. I was confused because it looked photoshopped or it might've been before we were dating. My friend told me to go to \"xxx\" and I found both of them making out. As usual I got mad and started crying, I told him that we should break up and he didn't even care. This really got me mad. As soon as I was about to leave I told him that he was just like his father and he surely has his father's DNA. Since he cheated on me I thought that he lied about his whole dad thing because in our relationship he lied about everything so I thought that he lied about his whole, hating his dad thing to ensure me he wouldn't be like his dad and cheat on me.\n\nWell I was wrong. Very wrong. He started crying and started screaming and begging me to forgive him. I quickly left. Tbh i was happy because he finally realized he was wrong.  \n\nHe used to text me all the time begging me to forgive him and how he wouldn't be like his father. I blocked him. Now whenever we see each other in the hallways he always looks at me with guilt. Me saying that really messed him up and i hear he does therapy now.\n\nI guess that's my revenge\n\nAlso I still use his netflix account , I'm pretty sure he knows that I have his acc but I guess he feels too much guilt to try to tell me to stop.",

Thing is, I live in a pretty diverse area, and additionally, I‚Äôm Jewish. I had asked the band director if we could play a Chanukah song at some point between all the Christmas ones. NOPE. He said there was no Chanukah music and we‚Äôd only play the Christmas stuff.\n\nNow initially I was like ‚Äòokay, I get it, there aren‚Äôt a lot of songs, but there are SOME.‚Äô I asked around and found out another musical group (jazz band, i think) was going to play a Chanukah song, but it had to be cut for reasons I don‚Äôt know. When I brought this up to the band director, saying we could use it since the other group wasn‚Äôt (keep in mind this would all be possible for us, and we even had a duplicate song with other groups) he STILL refused. This time he was short and rude to me, stating we would ONLY play Christmas music, not holiday music, not winter music, but specifically Christmas. \n\nI was upset. I may not be strictly religious, but the insistence that only Christmas music was important to him irritated me. I went back to my seat for practice, and when class started, he made an announcement: Instead of the typical white shirt or blouse we had to wear for performances, we were to wear red or green sweaters, even better if they were Christmas themed.\n\nI was like ‚Äòwhat the heck!‚Äô Again, we are in a very diverse area, and I was not the only person upset with the lack of representation. Then an idea came into my mind, a plot of passive-aggressive rebellion.\n\nOn the day of the performance, we all gathered in the band room before heading over to the gym. Everyone wore green and red sweaters or shirts under their hoodies. Everyone except me. Instead of what he requested, I wore a rich blue sweater that stuck out like a sore thumb in the sea of Christmas. When the director saw me, his smile faltered and he looked upset but didn‚Äôt have time to say anything to me as we walked out.\n\nNow one of my favorite parts; I‚Äôm a section leader and sit in first chair during sit-down performances, so *everyone* would see me from the bleachers, even the ones at the bottom. The effect it had was emphasized when we ONLY played Christmas music, as when the performance and applause ended, I could see some people whispering and pointing at my sweater and glancing at the director. He looked uncomfortable at the whispering and didn‚Äôt stick around for the rest of the assembly.\n\nMission accomplished.",

        "text": "Several years ago, I was living in an older neighborhood.  The houses were built in the 70's, and I loved the neighborhood.  We were close to the downtown area of our small town, a block from a large lake and just a few blocks from city parks and a beach on the lake.\n\nThere was only one problem with the neighborhood.  One of our neighbors was a younger man who drove a completely beat down POS Honda.  He had a modified exhaust system, attached to the small engine so whenever he drove by, it sounded like an angry weed eater going by.  But that wasn't the worst part of his crappy car.  He spent WAY too much money on a stereo system, and he loved to show it off.\n\nAnytime he drove by, you could hear him coming from blocks away.  As he got closer to my house, his bass would shake the walls and you couldn't hear your own tv or stereo.  You couldn't even have a conversation with anyone in your own house when this asshat drove by.\n\nAnd he didn't care what time of day or night it was.  2 in the afternoon, or 2 in the morning, his music was blasting everyone around.  Like everyone who has a car stereo like this his taste in music sucked.  It sucked something awful.\n\nWhat made this even more infuriating, is he would wake up my baby every time he drove by.  And it was several times a day every day and every night.\n\nWell, I happened to be a police officer at the time, and worked in a neighboring city.  His house was about 2 blocks from mine and one my way to work. One day while driving into work, I saw him outside his house working on his Piece of Shit car.  I decided to stop, and say hello.  I introduced myself as a neighbor and informed him that I was not there under any official status, just as a neighbor and let him know that his car stereo is extremely loud.  I told him he was waking up my baby and asked him to be considerate of his neighbors and turn down the music while he was in the neighborhood.  It was a friendly conversation and he agreed to turn down his music.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn't.  The loud music continued.  There was nothing I could do about it, since it wasn't in my jurisdiction and even if it was, it wouldn't be appropriate to take law enforcement action on someone I knew as a neighbor.  I did however, speak to a couple of friends who worked for the police department and let them know about the situation and asked they look out for his car and if they see any traffic violations, I would be happy if they wrote him every ticket they legally could.\n\nI thought nothing of it from that point on.  The loud music continued every time he drove by, and there was still nothing I could do about it.\n\nAbout 2 months later, I hear a knock on my door.  I answer it and find two local cops at the door.  They were smiling and simply asked, \"Did you do it?\"\n\nI asked \"Did I do what?\" and we went back and forth a couple of times before I learned they were asking about my 'friend' with the loud music.\n\nApparantly, I wasn't the only neighbor who did not appreciate his music.  Someone had left him a note on his car asking him to \"Turn that shit down\".  \n\nThe note was attached to the hood of his car, perfectly centered using four framing nails. From the damage to the paint, it was clear someone had used a Framing Nail Gun to secure the note, leaving four nice holes in the hood.\n\nI laughed and told the officers I agreed with the note, but No, I did not nail a note to the car. There was an investigation, but no leads were ever found to help identify who left the note.\n\nTo those reading this, I promise, I did NOT nail a note to that kid's car. I would have used a screw gun with self tapping screws.\n\nIt worked, I never heard the stereo again.",

        "text": "So this is actually a petty revenge against me and my uncle who run a local fitness store, made by our neighbors in the same building as us.\n\nIn Summer of 2021, in Utah, we had the hottest, driest summer in history. In August of 2021, we had the singular, worst rainstorm in a decade. So bad, the roof on our shared building collapsed. Me and my uncle are exclusively english speaking. Our neighbors run a Latin market and are mostly Spanish only. This is important for context.\n\nSo following the roof collapse we have a couple of months of cleanup and repairs and whatnot. My uncle, who is the store owner does not rent a trash dumpster, he only has a recycling dumpster. During this cleanup, we get a warning about not putting trash in our recycling. Confused, we go check our recycling and lo and behold, there is a ton of trash in our recycling.\n\nTo make a long story short, we talked to the clean up company as well as our neighbors and we discovered our neighbors were putting trash in our recycling. My uncle had to ask them to not leave trash in our recycling. Later that week, we check the recycling and once again, it was full of trash. So, we put a padlock on the recycling to prevent this. The next day, our neighbors left a handwritten note on our door apologizing and saying they were going to rent a dumpster and they would let us use it.\n\nQue petty revenge: following the clean up, we actually stopped the recycling dumpster rental, and our neighbors got a trash dumpster. And guess what! They padlocks the dumpster, contrary to what their handwritten note said. And I must say, we are absolutely devastated because we can't use it. We can barely function. We might as well go out of business now. 100% lesson learned.\n\nP.S. this was written on my phone and in a different sub post, someone said formatting was getting deleted, so if it's one big body of text, I apologize.",

        "text": "I was 10 years old at a sleepover with my whole Girl Scout troop (I loved them all) at one of the girl‚Äôs houses for her birthday. She decided to invite her family friend who none of us had ever met. Looking back, this girl was the most cliche Disney channel bully. She instantly picked me out of the group because I was closest with the mutual friend and that made her jealous. \n\n\nThe whole party was terrible, she found every way she could to bully me. She even cornered me in the bathroom stall at the bowling alley to tell me ‚Äú[friend] didn‚Äôt even want to invite you to this party but her mom made her‚Äù for example. She was just really going out of her way to say the most messed up shit. I was confused because when we all usually hung out (without her) we had the best time. I was getting really upset and eventually just wanted to go home. This was before cell phones were really given to kids so I asked the hosts mom to use her phone while i was crying. The mom said no. Then the moms friend said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ruining the party, they told me you were causing drama and you need to just GO MINGLE and stop.‚Äù I was stunned an adult said that to me without listening to my side (we weren‚Äôt like that in my house). I was so scared because I essentially had no way of calling my mom until 9 am the next day when she came to get me. \n\n\nWe went back to her house and parents went to sleep, so we had the whole living room and connected kitchen to ourselves (9 girls). The bully decided she had a secret she wanted everyone to know and made it a point to tell everyone but me, calling each girl over to her side of the room one at a time leaving me alone on the opposite side of the room. It was very Disney channel bully, she sat there and laughed at me, it was worse than getting picked last for gym class. She then said ‚Äúhmmmm I‚Äôm hungry. Someone make me a sandwich!‚Äù And a lightbulb just went off in my head. I screamed ‚ÄúILL DO IT!! ME! ILL MAKE YOU ONE‚Äù (damn girl play it cool lol). \n\n\nI ran to the ingredients, opened the peanut butter and used my fingers to smear it all over the bread. I was rogue now, I remember the exhilarating feeling of control and adrenaline while blacking out a little. Sweet revenge. I‚Äôve never done drugs but I imagine this is what it feels like lol. I spit in her sandwich about 10 times and added the top pice of bread, sliced it down the middle, and watched her eat it. I remember the feeling of her thinking she‚Äôs laughing at me, but I was the one who truly got the last laugh. I watched her eat the whole thing. I went home and told my parents everything, they were so angry I wasn‚Äôt allowed to call home. While they said understood what I did and why I did it, they asked me to please not do it again lol \n\nShocker: we are all 26 now and the girl grew up to be a terrible person.",

(No offence meant to Muppets.) They made my life hell and would routinely chase me home from school. Thankfully I could outrun them.  \nOne day as they were on my heels I ran to my front door and the screen was locked but the front door was open. This was very unusual my Mom generally kept the front door closed. I yelled \"Mom MOM let me in they are after me!\". \n\nMy Dad worked two jobs most of my life and was rarely home before late. Sometimes I would not see him for a week at a time. He had taught me how to defend myself with boxing techniques (over my mothers objections) but he never let up and we'd spar once in a while. Well, my dad had come home from work so my mom could do something away from the house. When he heard my pleas and came to the door he said, \"What's the problem here?\"  I said, \"These guys want to beat me up, dad. Let me in\". He said, \"You mean to tell me you're going to let these guys chase you into your own house, on you own yard? No way, you go out there and do what I taught you.\"   \n\n\nSo, I'm horrified but have to do what Dad said, so I go out to the main bully, Burt, the smaller one. Put up my dukes boxing style, protecting my neck and face. Burt took a swing at me and it glanced of my arms so I countered as hard as I could. Out pops Burt's tooth onto the ground in between us. I quickly reached down and snatched it up, stuck it in my pocket and put my dukes back up, ready for more.  \n\n\nBurt started crying about his tooth and ran home crying, Ernie declined to fight and ran after them. I don't recall my dad being much prouder of me ever and we had a laugh over it, l was felling pretty damn good.  \n\n\nA few minutes pass and at the door is \"BANG BANG BANG\". Dad is like, what the actual fuck and answers the door.  Burt's dad is there and he's a pretty big dude, tells my dad he wants the tooth back. Dad says, \"No, and if you don't get off my porch I'm gonna be taking one of your teeth next.'\n\nNeedless to say Burt and Ernie backed off and I've never had trouble with a bully since.",

I warned him that he ought to take care of the situation or I would. I was also tired of not having room in the closet. \nAt the time I was recording a lot of Mystery Science Theater 3000 from TV and kept running out of blank tapes so my solution to both conundra was to record over his prized videos. One tape a week for many, many weeks. Waste not, want not. \nOne day I took the box down to the curb for the garbage collectors to take away and didn‚Äôt mention it to him.

        "text": "So this story takes place in the mid 2000's when I was at secondary school (which is basically high school for you Yankee Doodle Dandees). I was 13 and going through that awkward stage in life where everything is changing in you constantly. One thing that was changing was the amount of gas my body created after a particularly long series of curries and chillies that my family made on the regular as they were cheap meals to cook and easy. Plus despite being as English as Paddington Bear we loved spicy food. \n\nSo the story takes place over a series of French classes in which I had a showdown with this very petty French Teacher who we'll call Mrs F. She regularly put kids in detention over everything and while some was justified like talking in class and not doing homework for me she decided that despite the fact that I was a half decent student who was courteous and polite because I would occasionally fart in class that was enough to put me in detention if someone smelt it and made a fuss. I tried everything to stay away from this woman's wrath like staying at the back of the class by a nearby open window to asking my parents if I can have something that was less likely to bring me flatuance. This all came to ahead though when I regularly was being given detention despite no obvious displine issues. The school was not obligated to tell parents why I received detention and the teacher didn't want to share I think. For a while I kept it hidden as both of my parents worked until I got home anyways and generally I was thinking that they couldn't do anything about it. This was until I was put into after-school detention on my 14th birthday. Now my parents always made a fuss about my birthdays as it was close to Christmas and they knew that I liked a day when I could pick anything for dinner and anything to do all night long. Now this detention was scheduled to last for 2 hours so there was no way I was getting home before mum and dad did and they were pissed when they found out that for nearly two months straight I'd been losing break times, lunchtimes and hours of my home life to this woman's insanity in her efforts to get me to stop farting. Now my dad was home after my mum every day and he asked my brother where my mum and me were as my mother had come to get me after calling the school to find out I was in after-school detention. She was after all planned to be ready to take us all out for a paid reservation in an Italian restaurant as my favourite food is and always has been lasagna. So while dad is frantically trying to get the reservation changed to no avail mum is collecting me. When she finds out that dad failed to get the money on the reservation back or the time changed she wasn't happy but she was pissed when she found out everything about why I was in detention and how much time I'd spent in it. Bare in mind that until this point I had disguised my after-school detentions as doing extra work for school projects so I was regularly just given bus money and told it's fine. Now this time I thought I'd try getting my French Teacher to be nice as it's my birthday but no chance. So the following day after my birthday my mum took the day off work and I was called into the school office to have a sit down with my French Teacher and the headmistress. My mum let me say my piece first and I asked my mum I was trying to not disturb anyone but sometimes it just happens. I made sure to be as innocent as possible. The headmistress asked Mrs F what compelled her to think that flatuance in class was worth so much punishment, to which she replied because he needs to learn to control himself. My mum then went on about how much money the family had spent getting me home from school because I couldn't take the 3oclock bus that my bus pass covered and they had to spend close to ¬£15 a week getting me home. She then added the cost of her workday she had to take off and the reservation that they lost on my birthday. She then did something I didn't see coming. She pulled out a pile of bus tickets and receipts along with a paystub from work to demonstrate the cost she was having to expend going so is the school paying me for all this or are you because I'm holding both responsible for the cost. In total between the bus tickets and the lost reservation and pay for the day it was about ¬£250. Mrs F then goes baldy I'll displine your child until he learns that he will not disturb the class with his disgusting body. I shrunk at this statement just a little bit then my headmistress said something I'll never forget. Don't worry about these costs. Mrs F will be paying for them in full out of her pocket before you leave today if she wants to keep her job as I can see your point that your child is not being a bad kid just a little bit gassy. Mrs F if you wish to put any child in detention from now on I'll be reviewing it before approving the detention as it is clear that you are abusing your power as a teacher. Now pay this lady her money and get back to work. With that Mrs F was fuming and agreed to pay my mother out of her paycheck. The school office handed the money over to my mother who proceeded to spend it on extra Christmas presents for me and my older brother that year. \n\nOh and how did my mum finish up her petty revenge she told me to sit in front of Mrs F's desk and loaded me up regularly on anything that will let me guff which I did with her never being able to punish me again üòÖ",

        "text": "When I (47 M) was 7 years old, there was a particular member of the church that was a total asshole. If you ever saw the Tom Cruise movie \"The Firm\", remember the diner scene with the Elvis impersonator? Well, this guy was the one that played that part in the movie. This dude was mean to kids when no other adults were around- often calling us stupid, in the way, waste of time, etc.\n\nHe also played the electric guitar for the praise and worship team at church. The problem was that he always cranked the amp WAY UP and played that guitar really loudly- enough to drown out everyone else. One day between Sunday school and the main service, I was exiting the bathroom and \"Elvis\" was at the door waiting for the bathroom. He commented, \"get out of here you stupid kid.\"\n\nAs I entered the main building I spotted his stupid guitar which was unattended and nobody else was around. I untuned his guitar making sure to turn some knobs way up and others way down. As the music started, he turned his guitar to the 150 dB level and started playing. What came out of that thing was the worst screeching, off tune garbage. I sat back looking innocent and enjoyed watching him freak out and spend the whole time trying to retune his guitar. Who's stupid now, mister?",

I found these two guys and everything was fine at first. One of the guys, John, was absolutely terrible immediately after the lease was signed. He is the type who thinks his farts smell better than everyone else‚Äôs. Everything I did was ‚Äúmy problem and I should get over it‚Äù. He was very loud and would often keep me up at night, only brought over women 20 years older than him and they were also loud, brag about his luxury car and his shitty lawn care sales job, and cause problems with me and the landlord to the point the landlord threatened to sell the house so we‚Äôd have to move(landlord loved me though). John would frequently text me telling me I was harassing him and was all around completely off his rocker and incredibly difficult to deal with. He wouldn‚Äôt even pay the remainder of the utilities when I moved out. \n\nAnyway fast forward to now. I had some packages mistakenly delivered to the old house and the second roommate who is so sweet kindly informed me that my packages were there and kept them inside for me while there was bad weather. Come to find out this really pissed off John who would throw my packages out onto the lawn. \n\nI know it‚Äôs been almost a year but I‚Äôd really like to get some petty revenge on John that doesn‚Äôt involve me spending any money or damaging property. I have his full name, phone number, and address. What can I do to have some harmless and fun last words before he moves and his lease is up?",

        "text": "TL/DR: Impatient driver misses Green traffic light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night driving my beat up works van home, I had the pleasure of an encounter with Mr. Impatient.\n\nNow Mr. Impatient wasn‚Äôt being particularly dangerous, just annoying. He came up behind me on a one-way street, flashing his lights, bipping his horn, tailing me on my left rear quarter, obviously wanting to pass. From where he was, he had a clear view of the road in front. There were various side roads that join from left and right, and parked cars on both sides at intervals that made it impossible for him to pass safely unless I were to pull in. It is a two-lane road, but the parked cars ensure that only a single line of traffic can travel down it.\n\nWhat you need to know about driving here (SE European country), is that because of a lack of enforcement, many road-laws, such as: Speed Limits; Parking Restrictions; No Entry Signs; One-Way Streets; even Helmets on Motorbikes are considered mere suggestions as opposed to mandatory legislation. Also, signage, road markings and even traffic lights are installed in a minimalist fashion unless on a major highway‚Äîwhich this road wasn‚Äôt.\n\nAnyway, as we approach a traffic-light controlled junction and the parked cars cease, Mr. Impatient passes me on my left‚Äîonly to be halted at a red light. \n\nThis junction is a five road intersection, with traffic lights on every incoming road. Each incoming road is two lanes‚ÄîI pull up in the right-hand lane at the lights with, level with Mr. Impatient on my left. Except for the road directly ahead, roads left and right are pretty blind, so you rely on the traffic light to proceed safely. There is only one traffic light at our entrance to the junction. Normal Red/Yel/Green for straight on or left, with an additional filter Green arrow for my lane to turn right only.\n\nMy works van is pretty beat up. It is an old, well abused, Ford Transit from 1995. It is basically a brick with a slightly angled front end and has all the aerodynamic properties of its kiln-fired clay counterpart‚Äîand here we are, side-by-side, at the traffic light.\n\nI edge forward. Mr. Impatient cannot see the traffic light.\n\nMr. Impatient edges forward so he can see.\n\nI edge forward some more, very very slowly. Leaning forward and peering out of the window as if I was looking for an address, blocking his view of the light.\n\nMr. Impatient edges forward again - as do I. The traffic light is now level with the back edge of my passenger window. I can still see that it is Red‚Ä¶. and Mr. Impatient can‚Äôt move any further forward without putting himself in danger or obstructing the cars from his left. So‚Ä¶ he cannot see the traffic light. \n\nIt‚Äôs really no big deal. You just sit there until the car next to you goes (or the car behind leans on the horn). \n\nI was watching. There were no cars behind us.\n\nOur lights go Green.\n\nSo I sit there.\n\nMr. Impatient sits there too.\n\nHis light goes Red. My light, because it is a right-turn filter lane, remains Green. I sit and wait for the cross traffic to start from the right‚Äîand when there is a nice flow of traffic, I go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see Mr. Impatient in my wing-mirror, his hands up in WTF? fashion as he has to sit there for another traffic-light cycle.",

        "text": "TRIGGER WARNING FOR BREIF MENTION OF FAKE ABUSE ALLEGATIONS + ONE MENTION OF CHILD ABUSE (just the phrase, no description)\n\nOkay, so context (Details changed for privacy - mine not theirs). My ex used to constantly make out to me that he was broke, I'm talking unable to buy groceries broke. So I frequently sent them money for what they needed.\n\nWe eventually broke up because of a misunderstanding, I'm Deaf, we were on facetime and I had misheard them due to the fact I rely heavily on lip reading, they have a strong accent, and I do not wear hearing aids,  I told them this before we started dating. I thought they had said something sexual, and as my parents were visiting and in the room, I laughed and said something along the lines of \"what the hell? my parents are here no way!\" they said it again, and I repeated \"My parents are in the room, no\" a little firmer this time. They get upset and hang up, they have anxiety so I assumed it was something to do with that and gave them some space.\n\nThey then messaged me for nudes and I said no. (I don't send nudes, and they knew this). They left me on seen and went to sleep, I was pissed that they were still pushing my boundaries and getting stroppy when they don't budge.\n\nThe next morning I wake up to a breakup message, so I wish them well and get on with my day. Next thing I know, my best friend is calling me screaming at me for apparently abusing my ex.\n\nI was raised in abuse, when I was younger I did have some emotionally abusive tendencies, which is why I didn't date until I had finished the trauma therapy and done healthy relationships work with my psychologist. So obviously after all that work, it was like a kick in the balls.\n\nAll of my friends stopped speaking to me (Fair enough, always believe a victim first) and of course, I don't blame them. The issue is we were dating during COVID, and I am very high risk, so the very few times we had met up (when restrictions allowed) we were socially distanced, and both of our parents were there as they had driven us. The alleged abuse was physical, both their mother and mine have confirmed that no abuse ever occurred, we had never even hugged. Last year they admitted that the allegations were all false, but it was much too late, it was all over social media, I had no friends, I had lost my job, and nearly lost my place at my collage (their mother testified to the college that nothing happened). Some of my friends tried to apologise, but our friendship was never the same afterwards, considering all of them had made calls to my workplace, my collage, and spread the fake incidents online. You still can't google my birth name without it coming up. I had to legally change my name because of it.\n\nAs it turns out, their wealth was not earned, so all of their cars were repossessed, and now this ex is actually poor #manifestation I guess.\n\n*CONTEXT OVER*\n\nSo today my area has flooded, no trains whatsoever. My ex lives a 30-40 minute walk from the train station, they were already there when I got there. Our train was cancelled so we both sat there for a while (I have grown my hair out, got loads of piercings, and lost a lot of weight, I don't think they recognised me at first), eventually the train guy comes out and tells us that trains are cancelled until 8pm earliest (It was 8:23am). I am a newly qualified driver because I was too ill to learn sooner, I had slipped on the road there more than once, so decided to sit there for 10 minutes, calm down, then drive home. \n\nAbout 5 minutes pass, and we get kicked out of the train station, I explain my situation to the train guy and he agrees to let me sit for a few more minutes, on the condition I told people there were no more trains - deal. He then recognises my voice and gets very quiet. \n\nTime comes and we both get kicked out, it was pouring down, so I went to my car, it was fogged up so I opened my window to help wipe off the fog, and I hear him shouting, I didn't catch it all (obviously, i'm Deaf) but I did catch that they were waiting for a taxi. \n\nA few minutes later he comes up to the window and asked if I could give him a lift, because the soonest taxi was in an hour, and he didn't have a jacket. I asked him if I knew him, acting oblivious. He just huffed and walked away.\n\nI sat there \"defogging\" my car for the whole hour :)",

        "text": "A little detail to understand the story. We have grades go from 1 to 10 in Argentina. You get three grades trough the year. To pass, their average must be over 6, if not, class is failed. Failing one class is not a big deal, but it's quite inconvenient.\n\nIt was my last year in highschool, history teacher explains our last assignment. We must do a research investigation in groups to deliver in two weeks and get our last grade. \n\nDesperately, two lazy classmates come running to me and my friend, knowing we're pretty nerdy, and will probably do the assignment even though they don't collaborate. \n\nThese guys were not bad people, but they were known to let others do their work in these group assignments we had. More than once we ended up doing their part, or making last hour corrections for things that had to be redone. And us two have had enough of this.\n\nI said to my friend we should wait for these guys to plan for our research. You know, see if they have initiative in any way. It was our last assignment of our last year of highschool! It was now or never. So we agree to do this together.\n\nDays go by and nothing. We're not even reminded by them that we have work to do and a due date. My friend tells me she's nervous about the assignment, but then I realized...\nwith our first and second grades, we could fail the assignment and still pass the class. We might loose a nice score on our reports, what we were willing to do that just to teach them a lesson. So we decide we'll do nothing unless they bring it up.\n\nThe day arrives, professor walks in to the class, the guy's come to see if we did the assignment... No report is done. They freak out, with no report they're failing it seems. So they talk to the teacher and convince him to give our group one more week.\n\nOur teacher was surprised to see me and my friend forgetting about something like this, but then he winked at us. I think he understood what we were trying to do and was ok with it. He knew how the other guys were.\n\nTo our amaze, nothing from these guys. We thought they might have done something without telling us. They don't even mention the investigation until next class, freaking out again. Professor walks in and never asks for our assignment, we don't say anything about it either, class goes by, and that's it. This whole thing goes into oblivion. \n\nCouple of weeks later, we're on our last day of school, we get our final scores when we're walking out of the building (that's like a tradition). We're all happy, celebrating that we're done with school. Meanwhile, I check my report. I pass all my classes, and then look for History and I see: 10 - 8 - 1 ~ 6,33. We had a 1! My friend passed the class too. So I look for the other guys... they both failed History. They must've thought the professor forgot or something, because they were so shocked. \n\nI cherish this after 10+ years. Perfect nerd revenge.",
