I also watch their kid from time to time when childcare falls through. I get along with the wife fine, but we aren’t usually social outside of hanging out as couples because she has her own large friend group. Which is whatever. Still would’ve considered her a friend. But there was an event last night that originally we were going to do as couples, well the guys backed out, so we each had an extra ticket. My friend I invited for mine couldn’t go so two of her friends (who I’ve also met) ended up going. I was fine with that. Except she did not loop me in at all what the plans were (and I needed to know, one of her friends couldn’t get in without me.) I had to keep asking. While at the event her friends included me more than she did. I let any negative feelings I had about it go and had fun anyways. But then today she posts on social media and only includes pics and commentary with her two friends and not gonna lie, it hurt my feelings. It’s very obvious now she doesn’t really consider me an actual friend at all. I know we’ll continue to be invited to do couple things (her husband doesn’t love hanging out with her friends), and I love their kid but at this point I also really don’t want to hang out with her either.\n\nSo yea, I guess I’m wondering how I navigate this relationship going forward when our husbands are good friends, and I know they’ll also ask for childcare again.",

I've definitely quit sharing certain types of updates with the group. And the thing is, I'm reasonably sure she makes more money than I do, though mine stretches farther because I don't have student debt from a masters and I'm married so I share expenses and we were able to buy a house a while back so I pay a very reasonable mortgage instead of paying rent. I just don't really know how to tell her to stop without it turning into a whole thing. I don't know, I don't get it.

I work a lot - I work from home and do freelance so I can have extra money for us. I try to take time out for me by working out. That's about all I usually get. When my kids are like arguing for the millionth time, or my eldest has literally not put away any of her clothes for a week or cleaned her room - or my partner has slacked on something (he's bad at time management), I always feel like it's the last straw and my upsetness manifests in yelling. Which then everyone is like why do you yell?? Like, I didn't want to yell - but when I asked nicely and with softness 20 times previous to this, apparently ya'll forgot and didn't do the things. And so yea, now I'm upset and I feel like I have to yell because apparently that's what gets you to go put your clothes away, do the dishes, mop ... \n\nI just feel lost abut it all. Because naturally I want to live my life with peace and ease. And quiet. That means from me too. I don't want to yell. But I have generally lost my patience because I seem to be the only one that has it together and everyone else still has to be asked/reminded to just get the basic things done around the house. I've had lectures where I've said \"We all live here together. We all work together to keep the house clean. I don't just buy myself food and make myself dinner - I buy food and make meals for everyone in this family. So yes, we keep the house clean, together.\" Why is it so hard... And how to I keep myself from yelling? I think it has a lot to do with what I witnessed. And I just don't want to be my mom. But gosh, I usually just feel like I should do everything myself. Because then at least it gets done and I don't have to yell.",

        "text": "Is this a problem for you, how do you react? I’ve noticed over the years, both when I was single and now coupled, that there are certain types of women who will always come on to my man. I’m struggling with how to react.\n\nThey are sometimes married but apparently desperate for attention, or single and desperate for attention. A couple of gals I’ve met seem to be in the habit of trying to sexually excite men in general, to draw their fascinated interest - they try and sit on their lap, lean on them, rub on them, come on to them. One in particular leaps around in front of my current boyfriend, speaking in a ridiculous English accent, apparently trying to show off her “ample bosom” and then rubbing his back and whispering “goodbye dah’ling” in his ear, when she leaves. Another laughs loudly at everything he utters, even when he’s talking to someone else fifty feet away, and follows him around once he leaves my side. A couple of ladies throw shade at me and demand that he stand up and hug them when they see him. This is all embarrassing for my new boyfriend and he’s trying to walk the line between being polite and not encouraging them. He’s struggling because as the newcomer he enjoys the attention, it’s better than being ignored, but he doesn’t want to make me mad either. These are all married women. \n\nWhen I was single, there was another type. Glamorous women who had never been married, never had children, and seemed to be determined to stay single. Yet, if I showed up with a date, if they even heard I had a date, if I met someone at an event where they were, they would show up and swoop in like predators, rubbing lightly on their arms, taking over the conversation, and doing everything they can to steal the man away. Which was easy, because they were far more attractive than I am, and it was someone I’d just met, or a first date. They would not be remotely interested in the guy, and once they’d secured him away from me, they’d dump him and want to tell me what trash he was. I remember one man standing there at this party looking genuinely hurt and confused as this glamorous gal he thought he’d won dumped him flat and was already off with someone else. I said to him, not to take it personally, that this was about female politics, she just wanted to make sure she could take him from me, and then once accomplished, she was done.\n\nI think these women are traitors, and certainly not friends. How do you handle them? And be real, nobody is really going to “beat their ass” or silly stuff like that. How do you handle such people in friend groups, communities, and parties where you don’t want to look stupid, but still want them to understand that they are being disrespectful, desperate, and hurtful?",

Outside of love, I'm pretty independent, have a career, a good friend group and social life/hobbies. However, been on/off with my recent ex for a year or so. I am anxiously attached and have really started trying to do the work on it. I have always had self-esteem issues due to very critical and emotionally neglectful parents. Everything that has happened recently has made me feel so unloved and alone. \n\nBooked in a free call with a semi-famous 'online dating coach'. Money is a bit tight, so I was reluctant to agree to one of their (quite expensive) packages on the call itself. I said I needed time to decide as my finances are currently tight, he then proceeded to call me an overthinker, a mess, a waste of time and he felt sorry for my ex and was surprised he could even date me. I said 'I'm sorry you feel that way' and he said 'why are you such a pushover with no boundaries, trying to be polite'. \n\nI'm already at a pretty low point in life emotionally, but I think that's nearly pushed me over the edge. I feel awful. I hate being so sensitive.",

        "text": "I'd be very grateful for advice from fellow 30+ women on how to cope with a break-up I absolutely did not see coming. I suppose it's like any other break-up but so far I've only ever experienced abusive relationships kinda falling apart on both sides and me being relieved when it ended. This one I just did not see coming because we've had a nice, healthy, happy relationship and I have hard time adjusting to the fact that he ended it. My brain keeps trying to make sense of it, mostly I feel like \"this is not happening\" and \"it's just a bad dream\" cliche. I just can't believe it.\n\nI spent the whole weekend crying. I need to move out, so I'm trying to focus on finding a new place but every apartment seems meh, probably because I'm just overwhelmed by feelings from the breakup and I want to stay \"home\" (I can't, it's his apartment). I also don't know if I want to stay in the area because I prefer routine and familiarity, or if I should move to a different part of town so that I get over him faster?\n\nHow do I stop crying all the time?\n\nI'm sad that his reason to break up is that he no longer feels in love with me. There is no other woman in the picture, no change in his routine, no new friends and such. He said that we \"lost the spark\" and he's been going through the motions for like a year already. I honestly had no idea. I'm so bummed because I love him and men like him are so hard to come by (respectful, kind, great hygiene, good lover, stable job, no mental health issues, does his chores). I definitely don't plan on dating again any time soon because I'm terrified of the bar that's in hell for most men. I'm just sad that I'm losing one of the few good ones and it feels like it will be impossible to eventually find a new partner who will both check all the basic boxes and be attracted to me/me being attacted to him, share similar hobbies and be on the same page about future plans.",

Driving them here and there to school, friends' homes, practice for sports, etc. helping with homework, meals, laundry, gift giving for holidays and birthdays, parent teacher conferences and meetings when my parents couldn't make it. You name it, I did it, with the exception, of course, of being their actual parents. \n\nNow we are adults and none of my siblings keep in touch with me. They never text me and ask how I am doing, or make any effort whatsoever to have a relationship with me, except to ask for my streaming service passwords. I send my youngest sibling money monthly so he has spending money at college. I've done this for six months, not 1 thank you. I gave all my siblings Christmas gifts, as I usually do, but they arrived to them all late because I was sick over the holidays, not 1 thank you from any of them or asking how I am feeling. The sibling I am closest in age to ignores my texts consistently, makes no effort to spend any time with me despite living on his own and having friends of similar age groups to me. He even has a friend who is dating one of my friends, and they all hang out and don't ever include me or my husband.\n\nI was talking to an older friend about this the other day and her advice was - stop spending money on people who don't care about you. Ask your siblings what you did to them to make them feel that it is okay for them to essentially treat me like I do not exist. Every once in a while I cry... because I don't know what I possibly could have done to these people to make them hate me so much. Any sibling advice is much appreciated. Thank you. :)",

I used to use Urgent Care and pay up front when I had simple stuff to treat, like last year I had poison ivy that became infected, but using that cost me well over 500 dollars just for 2 Dr's exams for prescriptions.  \n\nI am going through menopause and I'd really like to go to the Dr, since my symptoms are horrendous, but I had a simple 5 minute phone consult with GP Doctor and that cost $250.  I am at a loss.  It seems like I am not going to be able to pursue this any further, the Dr was like oh you need a Pap Smear and a Mammogram and routine bloodwork that will cost me thousands out of pocket, and I declined all because I don't have cash like that on hand.  I didn't even bring up the Menopause situation because what exactly is the point?  I can't afford any treatments.  \n\nI know that everything is getting expensive but this is asinine.  I had better options when I had insurance through my community college in the late 90s.  Hell I worked retail for years, my insurance was $10 a week and my copays were very reasonable.  I was better off when I made $9 an hour.  I could at least get some sort of care, even on a meager income.  \n\nI know a lot of women are high earners, or are married to a high earner,  and they have medical access, and I know people who can afford medical treatment, even things like bariatric surgery and IVF and things that are a bit beyond routine care, but I am so disappointed in this country.  I work FT and I am not sure what else I'm supposed to do.  The Dr mentioned preventative screenings and I was like, What exactly is the point?  If they find anything I can't afford to treat anything.  The nurse mentioned Medicaid and I was like I work full time and I am not disabled, I do not qualify for things like that. \n\nMaybe I don't have an actual question but I am bewildered by this.  I can't be the only on in this position, and the situation is so bleak.  Medical in the US is only going to get worse as time goes on.  No one seems to care, or maybe it's just a minority of us that are affected.  Oh, I mean, if you can afford all the state of the art stuff I'm sure it's great, but I mean, for us Common Folk I'm not sure what we are going to do here.",

        "text": "My husband (M42) and I (F36) had a microwedding at the end of 2022. We exchanged personal vows and had only six other people there. It was perfect and intimate. We are having another wedding in the Spring of 2023 with a guest list of about 80 close friends and family, following with a reception and honeymoon.\n\nThis is my second marriage and his first. For my first marriage we eloped at the courthouse and never had any sort of wedding, ceremony, or honeymoon. It made me feel like I wasn't worth the milestone celebration.\n\nTraditionally it's the bride's family who pays for the wedding. Unfortunately my exhusband drained me of all my savings (as I was young, stupid, and dependent on him.) And I needed a car after the divorce so I used my wedding fund to rebuild my life ie: to buy a car.\n\nMy now husband and I will be funding the wedding (I will be taking on the lion's share of the cost while my now husband said he'd help out.) The wedding date is getting closer. I am starting to get nervous. The final estimates are starting to roll in. But at least my mother doesn't have control over the details of the wedding/ceremony.\n\nTL;DR So what I want to know from you is what was/were your wedding(s) like if you've been married before? Did you do a veil and garter? What was your wedding budget? What is the most memorable thing about the last wedding you went to? What was the most cringey thing you witnessed at a wedding?\n\nGemme all the stories and the deets! TIA!!",

A past friend openly told me how he feels about everyone woman that crossed paths or walked passed him on the sidewalk and rated them and told me how he would have sex with them. How he would only be with someone if they had a perfect body. No longer talk to him. My uncle did the same thing to me! We went to get lunch because he was visiting out of state, and he pointed to every young chick (15 yrs younger) and told me hot he thinks they are and if he would sleep with them in detail, after telling him I'm bi. I'm not interested in this bs, especially if thats all they ever talk about! Stop objectifying woman as if their only worth is based on how attractive they are. They most defidently wouldn't give them the time of day. They own no man the time of day. They don't owe them prettiness or sex! Did anyone experience this with a male friend?",

Ever since going to Art School in my 20s, I, for a long time have loved Art Nouveau furniture and now that the antique market has dropped out, I'm finally able to buy the things that I like.  So I have been spending 1000s of dollars on antiques that I love and filling my home with things that I think are beautiful and functional.  but... I feel guilty... most of these items are more that I have ever spent on something in my entire life.  (other than a car)  I keep telling myself that I will have these pieces for the rest of my life.   Is $2000 too much for a bed?  $1700 for a gorgeous buffet?  What about $3000 for a table? I keep telling myself that I should be practical and put that money in retirement and stop spending it \"frivolously\"  I am on track for retirement but I could be more on track if I invested this money instead of spending it.  Any thoughts?  That desire to nest and have a home is incredibly strong especially since I've been never been able to settle down up to this point but I don't want to sacrifice my retirement for a beautiful home.",

My friend pointed out that I go for “free spirits” who have moved around a lot no real ties to the city we live in, love to travel / live abroad. They are super charming, successful smart. However their “free spirit” tends to be a mask for running away from something or a fear of settling down, commitmentphobe / avoidant type, and they usually admit later on that they fantasize about quitting their jobs and the country due to boredom/ feeling too comfortable and wanting to start all over somewhere else. \nIt was shocking for my friend to point out that everyone I have dated and liked for the last 4 yrs fits this type.. and they all end in the same way me getting tired of the lack of movement / commitment and walking away eventually. \n\nSo how do I change my type to more secure settled guys? And how do I attract these settled guys? These free spirit guys are over represented in dating apps. I’m usually attracted to their adventurous worldly nature and love of travel and experiencing new cultures as those are my likes as well. But I’m searching for a long term relationship and want a family. \n\nThank you x",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nFirst time poster. I tried googling this but it’s too complex. Just looking to learn so I can be a better partner and be more understanding. \n\nQuick backstory: been with an amazing girl for a few months and we get along really well. Really great communication and we have lots of fun and each seem to care about the other person a lot. It’s been sincerely wonderful. \n\nI know not every couple does this right away, but we discuss our health with each other and she’s been going through a little bit of an irregular period. We talk about it and she bounces her ideas of of me for how she is planning to approach. My position is always that I think she should always trust her instincts (she has great instincts) and that I’m here to listen. And always seek out medical advice if she has questions. This isn’t a question about female anatomy or menstruation, it’s about something I said and how it affected her.\n\nWe were talking on the phone for about 2 hours and through that convo this topic came up and we talked for a while. She says she sometimes bleeds more after we have sex but the bleeding in general doesn’t seem to be related to sex itself. I wondered out loud if penetration and her orgasms are creating a bit of a “wash” effect and causing more blood in that moment. This touched on a sensitivity which she explained to me as: “I don’t want someone to tell me pain and / or bleeding is normal when it doesn’t feel normal.” I said “of course” and clarified that I wouldn’t pretend to comment on what is normal / abnormal and that whatever her instinct is on this (like always) I completely support. She wasn’t angry and we moved past it and had a great convo afterward. I did apologize at the end of the convo and just let her know that if I was showing ignorance during that part of the convo, I was sorry she had to deal with that from me, and I’ll work to understand the experience more so I can be more sensitive. She was very gracious and we’ve been conversing normally since. \n\nSo here I am trying to learn.\n\n-\tIs this a thing that men have a habit of doing? “Normalizing” a woman’s pain / stress?\n-\tWould I be better to avoid commenting all together?\n-\tWhat is the best way for me to be a supportive and loving partner during a conversation like this one?\n-\tIf you were speculating about your reproductive health with a romantic partner, what would you like to hear in response?\n\nQuick notes:\n\n-\tHer pain is not severe and she’s not having it now. \n-\tShe is seeing a doctor and specialist already for this and nothing serious has come up so far\n-\tI would like to keep the convo focused on how I can improve my behaviour. I don’t really want to go down the road of diagnosing her situation. She has it in control. Hope thats okay!",

The main people who run it are a hetero couple (I'll call them Katrin and Julius), as well as the adult son of the man, who I'll call Max.\n\nTo make this short: they answered a user question recently about their love story/how they met. Katrin said they've been asked this before, but were hesitant to answer because it felt shameful. But, they decided to answer anyway. Julius says he doesn't find it shameful at all.\n\nAnd, well...they met when she was 15 and he was in his 30s.\n\nI knew they had a big age difference, but (after realizing they were a couple, which wasn't clear in the beginning) I always assumed they met when she was in her 20s.\n\nBut, no...15. And he doesn't even feel embarrassed about it, which he emphasized more than once.\n\nI really like this podcast. It's one of my favorites. I don't need it for learning German anymore; I'm fluent, and there are plenty of other \"real\" podcasts in German. But I really like listening to Katrin and Max (Julius is actually rarely on the podcast) talk about German culture.\n\nBut...now I just feel so squicked out by learning that Katrin was 15 when she met Julius. They said they didn't have their first date for a year-and-a-half after they met, but she would have still been under the age of 17. I believe the age of consent here is lower...but just because a law says one thing, doesn't necessarily mean it's ethical to do something.\n\nI've thought about only listening if I know Julius isn't on the podcast, and avoiding the YT channel where Julius is much more prominent...but I still feel weird about it.\n\nWould you keep listening?",

        "text": "Hi, I am healing from CPTSD and I have a very difficult time sometimes knowing what healthy behavior looks like and what reasonable expectations and responses to things are.\n\nIf you're exclusively dating a man would you expect him to tell you beforehand that he went to dinner with a platonic woman friend?  For context, they were platonic friends in college and haven't seen each other in 20 years.  She appears to be single of that matters.  \n\nI'm not upset that he had dinner, I'm upset that I found out about it from a photo on Facebook.  When I saw the photo I texted him and said, \"I want you to know that I consider you going out with another woman without letting me know is lying by omission.\"  He texted back that he understood that but he still didn't tell me about the dinner.  I definitely launched into a trauma response at that point and asked him why he lied to me.  He essentially cut off communication at that point and has now decided we should no longer date.\n\nI just need a reality check.  Is this really too much of an expectation for someone you're in an exclusive relationship with?  We've been dating for 10 months.",

        "text": "Since I'm a 31F, I decided to see what the women over 30 sub think about my current thoughts, and to gain any insight. \n\nI don't think talk therapy works. I've been in it pretty regularly for about 5 years. Over that time I've had 4 therapists, including the one I have now. The other 3 I kind of just naturally outgrew. \n\nIt does help me to talk about things out loud to other people. It gets me out of my own head and I get feedback that often helps with my general thought process. But I also have an amazing emotional support system of brillian friends with tons of life experience, and I feel like brunches with them help me significantly more than any therapy session I've been in. \n\nI feel very put on the spot in therapy. I practice an  alternative relationship style that I feel like every therapist is secretly judging, even if they say they're not. I do vet for that as much as I possibly can, but the feelings are still there. \n\nI've also had a couple therapists where I was introducing them to, and essentially educating them on pretty basic human sexuality-related stuff. Some of them just end up becoming very much like a good friend I'm having a one on one with, but we're not actually friends. It sometimes leaves me feeling very empty.\n\nI think talk therapy contributes to general wellness, like journaling, or 10 minute YouTube meditations do. But I don't think it actually works to solve or improve anything. Not in a way it's always touted on social media, and especially here on Reddit. It's not a fix, not even remotely close. My opinion is you have to add it into all the other self-care and general wellness practices that contribute to personal growth. Otherwise I feel like it doesn't work generally at all. But I know I'm being cynical and want your honest thoughts on this, or just different perspectives. TIA!",

        "text": "I've been ghosted over a month and a half ago. A few days ago a friend who's more familiar with him than I am saw him in a cafe and thought he was with me. My friend came up to the table to say hi and was immediately confused for two reasons, it wasn't me but it might as well be. My friend said he kept staring at her because it was so uncanny it's scary. He even did a double take and almost called her by my name to make sure he wasn't that hungover. My ghost gave him an awkward smile when he realized how weird it is to an onlooker.\n\nI need to point out that I don't have a common face, I'm distinctly recognizable.if you saw me once and had to pick me up from a lineup eyes half closed you easily would. I also have a small specifically shaped birth mark on my face. I have the type of face that makes old people say well that's one you don't forget. I've never met someone who looks like me although I'm sure they're out there. When I saw my friend at a dinner he showed me photo of her he found online and I was shocked I thought it was a photo of me from a few years ago. Same race, same ethnicity, same hair color, same eye color and shape, same nose, same lips, same skin tone, same birth mark although hers is a little darker, around the same height, same body type.\n\nEveryone at dinner immediately became interested in getting to the bottom of it and after a few researches they even found out we share the same interests and have similar personalities. The only difference is she's younger she just moved to a big city and she seems more impressionable which is fair considering.\n\nEveryone said this wasn't a coincidence that he went looking for me in someone else, that he found a more agreeable clone that he will project me onto. I don't know how to feel. This makes me really sad I don't want to take away from this woman and call her a lesser version of me that's gross. This guy really pursued me and then disappeared. I'm back at square one defeated, sad, depressed, crying. \n\nDo I say something?\n\nI’m so tired. Why can't I ever be enough?",

Last night my partner saw me getting dressed in leather (okay, pleather) pants to meet up with another couple for dinner; he referred to them as my \"midlife crisis pants.\" \n\nHe said this in a playful, flirtatious way. He thought they looked good and encouraged me to wear them when I expressed doubt about the outfit.\n\nDriving to dinner I asked him if he thought I was *really* going through a midlife crisis. (I believe I am, so I wanted his perspective). He said I was going through *something* before reassuring me that working out a lot and buying leather pants are mild forms of midlife crisis (i.e., he is not concerned).\n\nI agree that I'm going through something. This started last summer around my 39th birthday. I feel very *in between* life phases and resultantly, I have no idea what looks and feels good to wear to work or socialize. I have gone from following the mantra, \"your clothes should be the least interesting thing about you,\" to buying thigh high suede boots and pleather pants. I'm dressing for attention more than I'd like - but whose attention? And why? \n\nI've also recently lost those stubborn five *\"vanity pounds\"* that all perfectly fit women imagine they still want (need) to lose. Well, be careful what you wish for, ladies! My stomach is flat, but my boobs and hips are gone. My jeans fit great because lets me honest, women's jeans are made to fit pre-pubescent boys. But my chest looks sad. I won't wear anything with a neckline. I look worse naked. My partner hasn't said anything but I can tell he thinks I'm too thin. I also cannot \\*force\\* myself to just regain the five pounds I've spend decades hoping to lose. I'll certainly regain the weight over time because I eat plenty (I lost the weight while sick last winter and I exercise a lot so it's hard to gain weight), but it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nThe leather pants, missing 5 pounds, and feeling weird in my body.
