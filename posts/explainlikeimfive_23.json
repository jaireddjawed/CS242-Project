For example, stars might not vary that much from each other when you compare the percentages of hydrogen or helium or whatever. However, taking the star example, let's say we have a star an unknown (but really far) distance away, and scientists are analysing the light from it for the first time. How do you determine it's actual composition and account for all the random stuff the light must have bumped into on the way here, redshift, and then calculate the actual distance of the star to us? Surely every star still differs slightly in composition in relation to each other, right? I think there might be a flaw in my assumptions somewhere, but I'm not sure where to start questioning ☹️",
