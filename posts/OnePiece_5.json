If the show is successful, I don't imagine they'll go with many big names (aside from maybe Jamie Lee Curtis as Kureha) but it's fun to imagine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Perona:** Jena Malone. She does such a good job with crazy, over-the-top characters\n* **Big Mom:** Margo Martindale. The perfect look imo, and her southern accent could work really well\n* **Akainu:** Ken Watanabe. Does a great job portraying imposing, experienced, and serious\n* **Crocodile:** Oscar Isaac. I can just picture him doing the laugh\n* **Moria:** Will Ferrel. May sound weird at first, but could work with Moria's wackiness and moments of comic relief.\n* **Robin:** Jennifer Connelly. A bit on the older side, but she's basically ageless\n* **Bellamy:** Luke Hemsworth. Has exactly the look I imagine\n* **Kuzan:** Jamie Foxx. Just a 'cool' dude\n* **Kid:** Nicholas Hoult. I think he works for the look, but his Mad Max performance really sold me\n* **Caesar Clown:** Tom Kenny, the man of many voices. I think he could do this part justice\n* **Queen:** Seth Rogan. Hard for me to imagine anyone else, especially with the laugh\n* **Rayleigh:** Brad Pitt. Just the right look with his silver/blond long hair\n* **Dorry and Brogy:** Eddie Hall and Hafthor Bjornson. Basically 2 actual giants, who also happen to be rivals in real life\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my opinions. What do you think about these and potential casting for other characters?",

If you look at the fight between Whitebeard and Roger in Oden’s flashback you can see that when they come to clash their weapons, Whitebeard clearly is using his DF power, and that Roger is using his conquerors haki. And as we learn in the Luffy and Kaido fight, Luffy learns of a way to use his conquerors haki in one specific attack and that Kaido did so too. My theory is that Blackbeard can’t use/learn any form of haki bc he of what he is (we know he isn’t human). He knows that and he was present in the fight between the Whitebeards and Rogers, and he learned that the Gura Gura no mi is possibly the only DF that can counter high levels of haki. And that is why I think BB choose to steal the Gura Gura no mi. \nWhat do all of you think?",

Morgan's already made it seem like Luffy was up to no good with Vegapunk so I'm sure it would seem really legit to the public  and this might stir some kind of mass rebellion against the WG setting up the final showdown. \n\n\nBonus: *Also Usopp will get an upgrade with the bubble gun that renders devil fruit users powerless.

        "text": "Power scaling is a common trope of shonen manga/anime. But I think that one piece does it far better than anyone else. One piece’s power scaling system is the bounty system. But this in universe system can easily be changed and is tampered by in universe politics. This is a good thing. it gives the fans of one piece a general sense of how powerful different characters are but doesn’t confine them to a specific power level. So although a character’s bounty may be higher than another’s it doesn’t necessarily mean they will win in a fight. Given that said one can easily assume that a character with a 100k bounty could never think to defeat a character with a 1B bounty. Not only that but because of the unique powers of devil fruits this can again change drastically. For example I think we can all agree that Mr.1 is far more powerful than buggy, but he could never beat him “without haki” due to the fact that his devil fruit is completely useless against buggy. So in conclusion the bounty system is power scaling done right it gives a general sense of how strong a character is while still being flexible.",

        "text": "Okay so as much as I love Gear Fifth it doesn’t feel like a proper Gear for Luffy. Before we saw him create these power ups for himself and that was awesome you barely see that in Manga usually it’s just an emotional reaction that generates a new form. \n\nThose are cool but I liked that luffy was a self made man in this sense. He didn’t rely on any sort of crutch that if he was losing he would just gain a new form to combat it. So I’ve been thinking what if instead of Luffy’s fruit awakening being Gear Fifth the awakening is just his ability to apply his rubber to the environment, and instead Gear fifth is him coating himself in conquerors haki. \n\nI think this could be a viable path. We’ve seen him use Haki to create new Gears before and with each one we saw him push the boundaries of rubber. Plus we know that conquerors is just the user exerting their willpower on others. \n\nMaybe luffy could have applied this to his full body to then grant him further control and power. Able to still act like a looney toon’s character but less with a mythical awakening and more of his own ingenuity.\n\nAgain I do really love Gear Fifth and I’m not like upset that he acts all goofy cause it’s still Luffy and I’ll love him no matter what. I just have been thinking about this for a while and was wondering if anyone else though this could work.",

It’s just a shame that I’ve gotta wait another 200 episodes for it to even be mentioned.\n\nSome of the villains in this show are genuinely pure evil, like these ain’t no Naruto villains where you could stop them by negotiating, some of these people are genuinely cartoonishly evil (especially Morgan and Wapol).\n\nKoby is underrated and I hope that one day he will be the bridge between marines and pirates.\n\nThat scene with Luffy climbing the mountain on drum island is legitimately one of the most painful scenes I’ve ever watched from anything ever. Bless his gum gum soul.\n\nUsopp being a human with ordinary strength and speed is a pretty cool concept that I feel should be used in anime more often.\n\nVivi is so unbelievably pure hearted. She literally got slapped by a king as a child and she smiled and took it like it was nothing. She inspires me to be a more forgiving person.\n\nAre we SURE that there’s no connection between Tashigi and Kuina? I know their resemblance is likely a coincidence, but still.\n\nChopper deserved better.\n\nNami deserved better.\n\nKoby deserved better.\n\nEVERYONE deserved better.\n\nArlong’s design reminds me just how underrated creatures sawfish really are.\n\nIs there a reason that Robin’s complexion changes significantly after the time skip? Not a major complaint, just wondering if anyone knows.\n\nI love Laboon and I hope that he finds happiness and his head is healed soon.\n\nSpeaking of Laboon, how does he have an entire back rooms level inside him?\n\nIs it Arabasta or Alabasta? I prefer Alabasta, but I would love to hear what you guys think.\n\nThere’s only 2 intros so far but like 7 outros, a bit unusual but I appreciate the variety.\n\nBuggy and Ace are such an interesting parallel, growing up in the same environment, but ended up walking two different paths, with one becoming the strongest living man in the world, and the other not living up to his full potential, it’s actually kind of sad.\n\nDoes Zoro ever pay off his debt to Nami?\n\nAs I was typing up this list while watching the show, I got to a scene where Luffy shouts for Crocodile to come fight him in the middle of a casino, everyone stops and looks at him, and then goes right back to what they were doing, and that one clip honestly sums up the mood of the whole show.\n\nAnyways, that’s the end of my list of random takes, thanks for reading.",

It's related to health, as its a mushroom of a forest, which symbolises the many medicines civilisation has been acquiring fro the forest, mushrooms being one of them. \n\nThis can be seen in his forms, where he concentrates certain his focus into characteristics, which alter his body into a different form. For example, monster point, brain point etc. \n\nThe key is in 2 things : Kureha and the rumble. The rumble alters the biochemistry levels of the body to produce different results. Since the time skip, chopper learned to transform into most of his forms on will, showing how his fruit works. He mastered the ability to alter his own biochemistry, which the fruit provides him. \n\nKureha is a 140 or something year old woman and looks like she's in her 50's maybe? I suspect she's mastered a similar technique to maintain her youth by controlling her cells and biochemistry levels, but only to a basic level, compared to choppers fruit potential. \n\nThis will I'll be the key to achieve his dream and cure all diseases when he awakens his fruit. He will be able to easily alter the bio chemistry patterns and levels in life forms to remove the disease from their body, either through forcing the disease out or altering the body to make it resistant to that disease by telling the body which cells to produce to fight the disease immediately. \n\nWith an awakened form of this fruit, chopper will be able to eliminate disease from the inside of the body. This is unlike the OP OP fruit which is focused on surgery and injection, not on biochemistry and cellular functions.",

(Toei Animation) and Preferred Networks, Inc. (PFN) have jointly  conducted trials on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies  to streamline production of anime. As part of this effort, PFN’s  AI-powered background image production tool Scenify™ was introduced for  the production of [*URVAN*](https://youtu.be/V4xzPH3NZuo),  an experimental five-minute video published in February 2021 by Toei  Animation’s PEROs (Prototyping and Experimental Research in Oizumi  Studio) team. Scenify uses PFN’s AI-based image processing and  segmentation technologies.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/199q5w86buna1.png?width=1389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bd37a432e5d9e149ffb0f82f0433437f7b83860b\n\n*Adobe® Photoshop ® user interface of Scenify* \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq21ds28buna1.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3701d5195b86d26c35c1599f0234b50bb5cfe6f0\n\n\n\n*URVAN*  features scenery from the city of Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture in Japan,  in two anime styles: basic and cyberpunk. By using Scenify to  auto-convert scenery photographs into basic anime-style images,  pre-processing time was reduced to approximately a sixth compared to  conventional methods. Scenify was used in two-thirds of the background  images appearing in *URVAN*. Thanks to the reduced workload to  produce basic background images, Toei Animation artists could focus  their creative input on the cyberpunk elements.\n\n**Background image production using Scenify in experimental video** ***URVAN***\n\n📷  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsdbtmk9buna1.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=149449883115045f447b6643b8c41c5928a8394c\n\nOriginal photo\n\n📷  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buhxvsgabuna1.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d691bdf5d0bdcf217ea869471fdf50d683514e3\n\nAnime-style image converted by Scenify\n\n📷  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/po7kh1mbbuna1.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9c434d4da3ef4cea62ab24f2bd218a972658bc32\n\nFinal cyberpunk background retouched by Toei Animation artists \n\n©Toei Animation\n\n \n\nToei  Animation plans to use Scenify for the production of TV anime series  and anime films in the future.

PFN is currently focused on three priority areas –  transportation systems, manufacturing and bio-healthcare – and also  exploring the use of deep learning in personal robots, plant  optimization, materials discovery, sports analytics and entertainment.

Among these giants is Loki, the prince of Elbaf, who has yet to make an appearance in the series. Here's a theory about Loki, based on what we know about him so far:\n\nLoki is likely to play a significant role in the future of One Piece as a key ally or adversary of the Straw Hat crew. As the prince of Elbaf, Loki wields immense power and influence among his fellow giants. It's possible that he may be a potential ally for the Straw Hats in their quest for the ultimate treasure, One Piece.\n\nHowever, given the tumultuous history between the giants and the World Government, it's also possible that Loki may have his own agenda and may even be working with the government. It's possible that he may have been swayed by the government's promises of a peaceful coexistence with the humans, or he may have his own reasons for wanting to keep the status quo.\n\nAnother possibility is that Loki may be seeking revenge against the humans who have wronged the giants in the past. This could lead to him becoming an adversary of the Straw Hats, as they are often seen as representatives of the human race.\n\nIt’s also possible that Loki may have a personal connection to one of the Straw Hats, perhaps through a past encounter or through a shared goal. This could lead to him becoming a valuable ally to the crew, as he would have a personal stake in their success.\n\nIn any case, as a powerful and influential figure in the world of One Piece, Loki is sure to play a significant role in the future of the series.",

It's all about the \"facts\" maaan.\n\nI know that as the wings of the Pirate King, Sanji is meant to represent the idealist side of Luffy's quest while Zoro represents the sheer strength and ambition needed to achieve his goals as masterfully presented in MelonTeee's [video.] (https://youtu.be/DdZ96_wzR3U) Which is why it makes more sense for Zoro to have COC. However I believe that chasing something so unrealistic such as the All Blue requires an immense amount of will too. But having Sanji's character as a carefree cook of the sea doesn't really shout COC vibes. Until now. Bwahaha!\n\nThe changing character gag that Sanji has now everytime his eyebrow swirl flips can be a potential for him unlocking COC if he'll ever be able to. We can see in the last chapter that when Sanji kicked S Shark to protect Nami, his character was unusually more cruel and violent. He even said that if he ever ruled a country, it would be somewhere that hurting Nami would be a crime. Ruling a country eh??? (winkwink COC) \n\nIn short, the flipping eyebrows could be Sanji having a newly acquired split personality with the more aggressive one having COC. That's it. That's all I can come up with and I don't know what else to tell you. But I feel it in my gut, maaan. Give me some of that Sanji COC.\n\nAlso, I still think that Sanji will confront and reclaim the Germa Kingdom as his own thereby uncovering all the unknown portions of their history (conquering and getting kicked out of their kingdom) for us readers. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read and I will now gladly accept your trashtalk and roasts. Bow.\n\nTL;DR Sanji having a more aggressive split personality everytime his eyebrow flips can lead to him unlocking COC.",

        "text": "I wrote this in a rush so there might be some flukes\n\nWhy do I think that Usopp is the worst Straw Hat pirate? First of all for that we have to look at the straw hat pirates goals. Luffy - Wants to be Pirate King\nZoro- Wants to be the Greatest Swordsman\nNami- Wants to draw a world map\nUsopp- Wants to be a brave warrior of the sea\nSanji - Wants to find all blue\nRobin - Wants to put together the Rio  Poneglyph\nBrook- Wants to meet laboon again\nFranky - To build the greatest ship and sail it to the end of the Grand Line.\nChopper- Wants to cure every disease\nJimbei - Stop the fishman from being afraid of humans and vice versa\n\nEvery single one of the straw hats is working towards his goal and gaining attributes/ working on attributes that help them reach their own goal. So it is normal that not everyone on the crew will be an absolute unit of a person. For example Nami does not need to be strong to achieve her goal. Usopps goal how ever needs him to be strong,brave and have a warrior mindset. My problem is not with the fact Usopp was cowardly at the beginning. My problem with him is the fact he does not seem like he is working towards it. On the crew there are already quite a few formidable fighters. Like zoro, luffy, jinbei etc. He could ask them for help about how not to be such a coward. The biggest wtf moment for me is the fact that brooks goal is a really easy goal compared to Usopps but Brook is still so much stronger and he is just supposed to be a musician. If brook was weak there wouldnt be a problem with it. Brook does not even need to be strong and he is still much stronger than Usopp whose goal is to be a brave warrior of the sea. Also everyone on the ship while working towards their goal is helping luffy reach his. With usopp it feels like he is a dead weight who is not contributing much to luffys goal. Now I admit there were a few clutch moments like perona or sugar. But I just feel like Usopp could be so much more. \n\nAlso I know that Usopp is supposed to depict a normal human in those absurd  situations the crew faces from day to day but still a normal human being stuck with the same mindset and personality for 2-3 years without any development is a “loser”. \n\nImo Usopp is not cut out to be a pirate and is a disgrace to the Straw Hat Crew.",

Actually I don’t know if he now has a character trait that is capable to be developed in any kind of virtue. But I can’t understand why he would have all that Roger’s backstory if it was to be only a normal pirate with ordinary pirate mindset…Maybe he will use his luck and capacity to deceive as a resource to help Luffy or to disturb BB of the WG.\n\nWhat you guys think about it?",

You cannot separate them from the main story anymore. Because of this, and the fact that old stories like Enel's moon adventure are probably going to play a part eventually I feel that the anime is going to have to adapt all of them. Having a mini arc between wano and &gt;!Egghead!&lt; Will also have enough time to separate the anime and manga. It's starting to really catch up. After the mini arc they could probably organically animate the cover stories into the story. For those that are too separated for that to work they could probably have a dedicated segment in every episode, or a break for the cover story in a chiller moment in the story.\n\nThe anime cannot keep ignoring them at this point.",

        "text": "So I’ve convinced three friends separately to watch all of One Piece. I’ve been following the series for close to two decades now.\n\nAnd every time Ace is introduced my friends love him. Of course they do, he’s awesome. But I’m always afraid they’ll be spoiled. So I take drastic measures.\n\nI make sure to talk as if Ace is a huge part of the story currently. Not outright saying events that don’t happen, but more like “if you think he’s cool just wait till you’re caught up” that sort of thing.\n\nI get really into it, even mentioning how something reminds me of a cool Ace moment when he’s not even there like during Skypeia and Water 7/Enies Lobby.\n\nAll for it to peak at Impel Down/Marineford. By that point my friends subconsciously think Ace is definitely surviving, more so than a regular fan who knows Oda is adverse to killing outside of flashbacks. And Luffy fails in Impel Down, so they think that’s the “low” moment.\n\nOnly for them to be beyond shocked when Ace doesn’t make it.\n\nI’ve even asked them to let me mute words for them on Twitter and what not so they aren’t spoiled beforehand. \n\nThe pure disbelief on their faces is worth it every time.",
