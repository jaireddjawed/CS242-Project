        "text": "I will include a TL;DR for all you busy bees down below:\n\nWe are forced to write the entire programming assignment by handwriting on book! Our faculty is making us write the **output** of an sql query, **The query we wrote to execute a output** ,**draw the table, write entire QUESTIONS, page numbers for every single 200 page notebook** just for his convenience so that he can see it in the index view which he barely even reads and does a tick mark for completion thats it. When we write programming queries all of this is **automatic** we do the task according to the needs there is no need for us to submit too many assignments. *WHY JUST WHY* do we have to suffer? Why do we have to write the syntax's for programming languages on book which is automatic in computers? What would we possibly f'ing learn by doing practical work on books? Every single university that me and my friends have attended has been forcing us to study in this legacy method of teaching standards. Just now I submitted my practical assignments on book along with the theory one. But now he is telling me to **rewrite all my assignments which I worked hard for because I made the mistake on writing both the practical and theory assignment in a single book instead of a different one!** I told him I made an honest mistake but he says it was intentional so now I will have to waste all my precious time in my life which I will never regain to write the same shit again just because I did it combined in a single book.  I can give even more extreme examples then this but I am tired and would like to stop at my today's torment which happened just a few minutes ago the time I posted this. Btw this is my second post here. I will link my first one in here for a better overview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Faculty forces us to write programming languages on book and told me to write the entire assignment because I made a mistake of not creating 2 different books for theory and practicals and instead did it all in one.",

The teacher is 10, but because of that, he keeps showing many, many ways to do a certain function. And when I try to keep up with everything, I end up forgetting the main ones. How long does it take more or less to get the hang of it and start making a website by yourself?
