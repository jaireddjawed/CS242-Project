        "text": "Brit reporting in. My SO and I want to have a go at [chicken-fried steak](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/how-to-make-the-best-chicken-fried-steak.html), something that doesn't exist here. It seems like the end goal is a well-done, tenderised steak with a fried chicken-like crust, which sounds good to us. Not sure I really get the gravy/bechamel bit, but I can follow a recipe and will trust you guys that this is a good combo ;)\n\nMy basic question is, is there any benefit/defecit to brining the steaks? Probably after hammering them out? And is there anything else an uninitiated person should know before making this? Any suggestions on side dishes, further seasonings to steak/batter/gravy?",

The salmon was moist as hell and had a nice crispy, carmelized edge that tasted like salmon bacon.  The only reason I didn't buy it was because it was too big for just one person - I'd be eating it for days on end.  I was thinking of trying to bake the salmon in foil with the marinade from [this](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/02/crispy-smoked-mushroom-bacon-bits-vegan-recipe.html) and then smoking it on the stove.  Do you think that would work?",

It is my understanding that pretty much all salmon sold in the USA is farm raised from other countries (yes, some places use chemicals and some don't, not looking to be political) and if under certain regulations, just because it is labeled as \"WILD\" does not mean it is actually caught out in the ocean.  SO, my question is, what actually defines the difference between 'Farm' and 'Wild'?",

        "text": "I posted a few days ago asking for advice about tripling kenjis barbacoa recipe, and as the title implies, it was a disaster. The sauce (and by extension, meat) had a terrible metallic, chemical flavor. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the worst thing I've made, so much so that I threw it all out (also a first) and couldn't sleep due to the lingering flavor in my mouth. Not to beat a dead horse, but it was the only thing I've made in memory that was truly revolting - I've made my fair share of mediocre and subpar food, but never anything that made my stomach turn. Now I know this has nothing to do with the recipe as I've made countless SE recipes, so I'm wondering if anyone could give insights into how this could've happened.\n\nNotable changes I made we're I used only ancho (4) and guajillo (5) peppers, skipped the oxtail and did pretty much everything in a roasting pan.  I already know the latter piece was a mistake and am kicking myself for being lazy and not doing all my searing and sauteing in a dutch oven before transferring, but I can't imagine this would somehow lead to the poison I just threw out.\n\nI did experience abnormal oil burning due to being a dumbass and using a roasting pan, but I actually emptied the pan when this happened and cleaned it out to start fresh. Besides those things, I pretty much followed the recipe as close as possible, performing the oven cooking in that roasting pan with heavy duty foil on top - this did take 10 hours which is throwing red flags in my mind. The roasting pan I used was the Cuisinart, 16 inch one that SE has in their kitchen essentials article for reference.\n\nLet me know if you can think of any reason why something like this might happen. My ego is bruised after promising delicious barbacoa and being unable to deliver, and I really want to know how I can avoid this in the future.",

I think the olive oil got past it's smoke point on the edges.\n\nSo now I'm looking for some ideas before I try this again...\n\n* So this morning I verified that the oven temp was accurate (550 setting = 550 actual)\n* Did I use the wrong EVO?\n* Too much cheese against the edge of the pan?\n\nAny other things I should consider?  Any input would be great.\n\n\n",

        "text": "My mom is a wonderfully kind lady that just celebrated her 54th birthday last week. A vast majority of my meals growing up were made at home of which she cooked about 98% of them and they were great for supporting my family growing up.\n\nI really enjoy cooking but I never spent much actual time next to my mom in the kitchen. I took her good habits of homecooking most of my meals, but I honestly learned most of my cooking technique from moving out for college and then the last 5 or so years living alone and picking stuff up from Alton Brown, Chef John, and most importantly Serious Eats. I've made a ton of SE/Food Lab recipes for my folks when I've been over to visit, from the smashed burgers, to the cherry tomato and basil pasta, to the reverse seared steaks, and they loved them all.\n\nTo my surprise, my mom started asked me for some of my recipes, and for some of the adjustments I made to her recipes based basically off stuff I learned online. And to my even bigger surprise, when I visited today, she told me she found a new way to make chicken cacciatore, which she found off the website Serious Eats (Gritzer's recipe)! And it was FUCKING DELICIOUS.\n\nI had mentioned Serious Eats plenty of times and showed her the Youtube video of Kenji making his quick blistered cherry tomato and basil pasta. She said Kenji reminded her of me (even though I'm a bit skinnier with bigger hair, it must be our kind eyes), and apparently she went digging around the site herself.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) Do you have any particular favorite SE/Food Lab recipes that are good for weekend meal prep and reheating in the oven/skillet over the week? My mom is busy at work and generally preps 2-3 meals over the weekend to reheat over the week for her, my dad, and little brother.\n\n2) Is there anything you like in particular from SE/Food Lab to impress a small party? Now that my mom knows where I steal all my cooking stuff from I might need new things to impress them when I come over to cook\n\nPS my mom makes better beef nilaga and pancit sotanghon than I ever will so I'm not saying I'm a better cook than her, she just likes a couple things I make",

I'm a web designer so this one bugs me maybe more than it should.... but you scroll down reading the article for a recipe (sometimes a long way down) and when you finally get to the bottom it's appears at first glance that the article starts all over again. It's got the same header,  same image - same look and feel except it says \"Recipe\". Then it clicks, \"Oh - it's the recipe stupid!\"... even though it appears the article just duplicated itself. It seems odd to shove the recipe so far down at the bottom beneath the main article. I hate to use a competitor as an example, but I'd love Serious Eats to switch to a more user friendly layout similar to Cook's Illustrated's site. You've got the full article and recipe ready at a glance. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jzh2SGi.png",
