I'm struggling to make the choice as I don't really have experience of the importance of different factors, namely institutional/lab reputation.\n\nObviously Tōdai is the more prestigious institution, and the lab I'd be joining is well-known and highly regarded. The lab at Keio is much smaller and the PI is less well-established (H-index ~10-15 Vs 55-60 at Tōdai, not that that means much on its own I guess.)\n\nI've heard that prestige and clout are very important for creating opportunities, particularly in Japan. But I've also heard that bigger labs tend to mean a lot less contact with one's PI, and if I'm honest I am more than a little worried about the pressure and work culture at Tōdai; my PI even warned me that they're very demanding. I thought being the only doctoral student at a smaller lab might mean I work more closely with my PI. I don't think I want to work in academia, and not everyone has to study at a super high impact lab right? Maybe I can make up for the smaller lab in other ways too\n\nAnother major point is that I have an offer of funding at Keio. At Tōdai I'd have to rely on my savings and family support while applying for scholarships &amp; fellowships (with no way to predict or plan how much I'd get, if any). I thought about telling Tōdai about this offer on the off chance they offer to fund me as well, though that seems incredibly remote).\n\nFeel free to call me an idiot or fool for not asking these questions before I applied; I can't really disagree!

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/11bashb/a_modern_way_to_share_notes_and_ideas_while/",
        "text": "I have a lifelong love for learning, learning about science, math, religion, language, history, etc.. In studying things, I have come up with various \"theories\" (to use the term loosely) on potentially why things are the way they are or how things may have occurred or how things might be structured. 99% of these \"thoughts\" are probably wrong, but yet they are part of the creative process in trying to figure out models of the truth. So I'm wondering what one could do to optimally collect, organize, and \"share\" one's thoughts, ideas, models, and theories, _while they are being developed_, before they are all perfectly organized to be shared in a nice and clean paper.\n\nI am imagining like open source software. At the start of a project, people still open source stuff, before there is a README or any docs, before the code is commented, before even the code is written, or if some code is written, it only covers a small fraction of the overall goal of the project. Over the years the project grows and evolves to something that can become called \"finished\", at least at a specific version. Then major, minor, and patch updates are made to this project forever into the future as it is refined.\n\nOn the other hand, modern research papers are published with say a model of some sort, and the model is never versioned or hardly in a more raw state.\n\nWhat would be best to do in the modern world with the modern tool sets of it being easy to create and host websites/blogs and share notes? Should you keep things private for years until they are formally considered \"finished\" (like writing a book, don't release until it's done)? Or should you release your raw notes and ideas as they flow out, and organize them into an overall picture?\n\nA related note, I am wondering how people like Isaac Newton in the past wrote his giant Principia, or others like him. Did they share their notes with others? Did they write notes and come up with fantastical ideas in the process of arriving at their final models (like Einstein's 1905's paper)? Like for Einstein, maybe he wrote all kinds of notes and models before he was clear of his final model, and his intermediate stuff was considered crazy, so he never shared it. I don't know the details or how this works.\n\nMy feeling is it would be cool to release your notes and things as you go. But potential problems are:\n\n1. Your ideas are probably incomplete or don't make full sense yet, so people could easily disagree with them, and then build a reputation for not being complete or logical (because at first, your models are patchy and hypothetical at best).\n2. You could confuse people because of the same reasons.\n\nAt the same time, your partial insight might trigger some spark in someone else, so having the partial notes could be beneficial (it would be amazing to see thought processes and notes from Mathematicians figuring out their theories, for example).\n\nWould having a website with notes, experiments, and models at separate URLs, with versioning of models be a suitable solution? Or what would you like to see out there, in an ideal world?\n\nNote, I don't think I have any qualifications or experience to come up with some great theory or model, but I would still think it would be fun to share ideas I've had, like a blog, but somehow organize things better so it is more like aiming toward a single model or set of models about things, maybe working ultimately toward a sci-fi book or \"philosophy\" book, which might explore possibilities and hypothetical models on how things are.",

        "text": "I’ve been working on a project for my masters thesis that basically involves fruit fly attraction/repellency to certain compounds. It was going really well in the early experiments; we got significant results and have tried to get our results published. Unfortunately we got rejected since the reviewers wanted to see some more experiments, one of them being a dose-response study. I tried to follow the methodology we’ve been previously using, slightly altered (previous tests were choice tests, the new test is a no-choice) which has also been used successfully by others. However, the controls are just not working how they should. I’ve tried a number of ways to troubleshoot this issue, but I’m still getting unresponsive controls and I can’t seem to figure out why. The only thing that really changed is that I have to use a different fume hood than the one I used previously since that one broke. But otherwise, I feel like that shouldn’t make a huge difference. I’m starting to think that we should change the method completely, but my PI has been suggesting more changes to the current protocol. I’ve changed things around it about three or four times now to reduce noise, but it seems like nothing is working. \n\nMy question is: what do you do if an experiment clearly isn’t working out, or how long before you give up on it?",

The first link does not open and the other 3 have a common author (leading me to believe that they may be my reviewer). This would not have been a problem if the papers were relevant to my work, but 2 out of 3 papers were vaguely related to an algorithm I used i.e. not prior art and the last paper was related to the broad topic of my paper but could not be considered prior art either.\n\nMy questions are: What is the best way to respond to this comment? I don't want to seem ungrateful or insinuate that the reviewer may have sent these links to gather additional citations for their own work (although I am inclined to suspect this). Is it ethical for reviewers to send their own (unrelated) work during blind reviews, and if not is there something I should/can do about it?\n\nThanks in advance for any answers or suggestions!",

This is such an intrinsic part of the research. Has anyone ever faced such an issue? What can be done to overcome this. I get very anxious in times like this and hate myself for being so.

What if I compiled a list of every TT non clinical faculty working at an accredited university (using APA and our national association’s website) and did a search of not only our search terms but also used the author limiter to only show results by current faculty. \n\nThere are roughly 800 faculty at these programs.

However, this lady crossed a line.\n\nIn class when students ask a question, she'll snap on them and tell them they're not paying attention. Sometimes she'll answer though, so I figured it's always worth the risk to ask especially because I'm just trying to learn. Well, few weeks ago we had assignments due, and she was calling us up for feedback one-by-one. When it was my turn, I walked up and showed her my work so far. She takes a look and immediately tells me everything is wrong. I wasn't following her, so I simply asked if she can show me an example that I can use to refer to.  She blew up, told me she will not, that it's my fault for not following directions. Then, in front of the whole class, tells me I am a terrible student and that she has seen all of my grades and gpa, that I should drop her class and go somewhere else.\n\nI looked around and the whole class looked shocked, and I was so so mortified. She's right, they're not great, but why would she decide to say that so publicly? Obviously I left, and I was so upset for weeks. I dropped the class before the W deadline but I haven't been able to stop thinking about that day. I want to report her, but I have ambitions in academia. Will I be sacrificing my reputation at this school if I somehow become the catalyst for her losing her job? I don't want to be seen as a trouble student...",

I know it’s a newer speciality but it’s leaving me a little unsure how to proceed with picking a school. It feels like the university will say they have gender and sexuality as a research topic but then only 2 professors that study it and it kinda feels like an ancillary interest and not their main interest. Was wondering if anybody out there had any experience finding a program? What did you look for and how did you find it? If u know if a good program it be great if you could drop the link!

Going into academia has long been a goal of mine, but it hasn't really seemed all that feasible. I have a job offer to go work full time at a real estate private equity firm in New York after graduation, which is very appealing; however, I've recently found out that I've been admitted to a top MPhil program in philosophy with great PhD placements. The program is, however, likely going to be unfunded and I may have to take out \\~30-40k in loans, though I don't have any loans from my undergraduate. On the other hand, I've also recently found out that I've been accepted to an MS in Math at a top 50, and this program will likely be funded. What I'm curious about are the following:\n\n1. How realistic, at this point, is placing into a top tier PhD program in philosophy vs math?\n2. How realistic is a tenure track job as a philosopher vs a mathematician\n3. What sorts of \"exit options\" exist between the two programs if I don't want to move on to the PhD level? Ie, is management consulting or investment banking more or less doable from either schools? Both are large, brand name schools, but the philosophy offer significantly more so than the math offer.\n\nI think that I would find either course of study to be intellectually stimulating and interesting, the particular topic I'm interested in is the infinite which falls somewhat in between the two fields.",

Several students, realizing the bullshit in this rule, ignored it and continued to exit through the door, or prop it open while stepping out for a quick smoke.

I run participants obviously but have other responsibilities as well, I'm pretty much an RA with some extra stuff to do. The thing is, everyone in my lab is crazy smart and I'm dumb as rocks compared to all of them. Everyone is really nice and communicative, but I can't help feeling like I'm annoying them or doing something wrong by even asking a question or making conversation. The lab I work in is small and relatively informal as well so everyone knows everything about everyone else, and I guess my main questions are 1) is there a way to just \\*not\\* annoy them and 2) Do y'all have any advice on getting past that anxiety I have around everyone that's smarter/more educated than me?\n\nAlso, what questions are stupid questions to ask? I asked someone I worked with about getting onto a grant (Probably stupid) and they didn't respond so I deleted the message and am currently freaking out. The only reason I even bothered asking is because I am in desperate need of a post-bacc research job since I didn't get into any grad programs. I'm already well aware that asking in the first place was a mistake but any further advice on what I can and can't ask would be great. I know I'm a pretty annoying person anyways and am normally more on the quiet side.",

        "text": "Hi there, this is my first post here - I am an undergraduate student. \n\nWe are 8 weeks into the 10 week quarter, and in this class, since week 2 we have had a weekly assignment called a \"Problem Set\" due on Fridays at 11:30AM. There are 8 total sets in the course. This is the **only homework in the class**, and they take up **40%** of the final grade. They can be submitted by 11:59PM the same day for a 10% reduction of grade. After that, it is an unsubmittable zero. I missed the first two problem sets due to my own negligence - I do have ADHD and it greatly affects my ability to start and finish tasks. Because of this, I'm in a disability resource program called DRS that gives me certain accommodations during exams (1.5x time and a special room to take them in). These accommodations are only present for exams and nothing else. In this particular class, our midterm exam was a week-long take home exam which is why my accommodations weren't necessary. My ADHD, combined with some other factors, resulted in me being sloppy and careless academically at the start of the quarter. My problem set grades *have* been steadily improving since, though, and I submitted Set #6 four days ahead of the due date.\n\n**This is all to provide some context to my email**. I'll go ahead and copy-paste it under here. If you could provide some feedback that would be greatly appreciated! My personal critique might be to make it more concise. I am on medication which admittedly does make me very wordy so it's something I'm trying to work on. Anyway, here it is:\n\n---\n\n\"Hello Professor .....,\n\nI hope you're having a nice afternoon! This is ..... ..... from your ..... ..... class. I am enrolled in DRS due to my ADHD which inhibits my ability to perform in school - as such I have certain accommodations to help with that, mainly being given extra time and special spaces for exams. \n\nI'll get to the point of this email immediately. I missed completing and submitting Problem Sets 1 and 2. To be clear: I am absolutely at fault for this and must learn to be flexible to accommodate my own disabilities. With that said, I can't help but consider that it had me in a particular mental rut early in the quarter which resulted in academic negligence. Not an excuse, but a reason. As late as it is, I want to remediate it in some way.\n\nI understand it is very late in the quarter with respect to the assignment dates. I also understand that every student is given an equal chance at participating, and by allowing me a loophole it would be unfair to them. At the same time, I know that you can't get something if you never ask. If by some measure you would allow me to recoup even a fraction of the available points from Problem Sets 1 and 2, I would be incredibly grateful. I am aware that the answers are out, so even considering everything else it's an unrealistic ask - I would need you to trust that I will absolutely not use them. Considering the importance of HW in grading, these problem sets carry a lot of weight, and I should have known better. It doesn't feel good thinking about the actions I took that resulted in the lack of submission. But, if you observe the trend of my assignment grades, my scores have been markedly improving each and every week, and I am sure you can also see the increase in effort in my work. I am committed to no longer submitting late assignments. While it's not something a typical student should be proud of, I submitted our most recent Problem Set #6 long before the due date; as insignificant as it may seem, this was a big personal victory for me. I hope this example, my Problem Set grade trends and my Midterm grade of 94% are enough to show you that I am unequivocally determined to turn my performance around in your class. With the structure of our exams eliminating my need for testing accommodations, I think this could maybe be a fair way of accommodating for my ADHD which for better or worse had a big effect on me early in the quarter.\n\nRegardless of your decision, I would like to thank you for not only your passion and clarity in lecture, which has made studying the subject enjoyable, but also for how immeasurably helpful the exam structure has been. Extending the exam period took so much time pressure off my shoulders and allowed a leeway in applying the material that I don't usually get the chance for during timed exams. It's clear you have a love for the subject and want your students to succeed. \n\nI hope you have an excellent rest of your quarter and I look forward to completing the course, extensions or not. Thank you once more for your patience, promptness and understanding. Best,\n\n....\"\n\n---\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m looking at two universities: Grand Canyon University and Arizona State University. \n\nGCU is about 7-10k cheaper, depending. I’m not rich, and this is a lot of money. However, it is not a public university. It is considered for-profit by the federal government (depending on which agency you ask, it is nonprofit), and has a reputation for being a degree mill. As for my program, it is accredited and provides the curriculum that is needed. I assume it would be comparable to ASU in quality of education. Regardless, it is not an established research university. \n\nHowever, in the future, I have thought of becoming a nurse professor, and attaining a research PhD (hopefully fully funded). Would getting my BSN from GCU harm my chances of getting into one of these programs? Nurse PhD’s are so different from normal programs, so if anyone who has specific knowledge of this field could offer advice, I’d appreciate it. Is entry into these programs just about work experience? If I received a higher degree (MSN, DNP) from an established, brick and mortar university, would this balance me out? I’m just very confused! I always like to keep options open, even if I’m not sure if my path as of now.",

That is, until last semester that I failed a course (all A's in 4 other courses though). Seeing as it is my final year, I'm afraid that I have no chance of higher academia because of that one grade. I tried to ask for special consideration to turn my grade to no credit as I had a hefty medical procedure done right around the final (which was worth 85%, I got 13.6 from the remaining 15%). But, they said because I had already taken the final there was nothing they could do. Is there anyone here that had a similar situation but got into a masters anyway? Please I need a morsel of hope I can see no future for myself right now and the only thing keeping me going is my dogs and my family.",

He says that he receives requests from journals occasionally to write reviews and he will hand one off to me.  \n\n\nWell a couple weeks ago he passed on a review request to me from the Journal of European Society of Medicine. I believe their official journal is called the Medical Research Archives.  \n([Medical Research Archives](https://esmed.org/MRA/mra))  \n\n\nI didn't think much of it initially, but today I decided to take a look at the journal that requested the submission and I found links ([European Society of Medicine solicitations](https://it.brown.edu/phish-bowl-alerts/european-society-medicine-solicitations)) that seem to make me think the journal is predatory.  \n\n\nI have tried to find some of the publications online, but when I type the title of the paper into pubmed it comes back with nothing. The Medical Research Archives has their own DOI link but it re-directs me back to their site. It seems to be their own DOI generated link and it doesn't link me to pubmed or anything like that.  \n\n\nI have my suspicions that this is a predatory journal.   \n\n\nThis is my first project assigned to me by my PI. I'm not entirely sure if he is even aware that this is a predatory journal or not and I don't know how to approach him regarding this. I don't want to be rude and accuse him of wasting my time by writing an illegitimate review or whatever. It's highly likely the cost of publication will be exorbitant and the fact that it most likely won't even be indexed into pubmed is disheartening.  \n\n\nWhat should I do? How do I let my PI know that this journal is predatory and I would like to write a review or do a project that will be submitted to a pubmed index'd journal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Upon further inspection, I am quite confident the journal is predatory as I am able to find the journal title on this page that lists predatory journals: [LIST OF STANDALONE JOURNALS | Scholarly Open Access (archive.fo)](https://archive.fo/9MAAD)",

Like could talk for 12 hours straight about writing with a lot left in the tank to go for another week. \n\nI can speak persuasively about the importance of incorporating researched-based writing practices and pedagogy across the disciplines. If Congress called me to the podium tomorrow to argue for revamping a federal K12 curriculum to include a writing-intensive focus, I wouldn't even need to bring notes. I could argue, with emotion, fervently for the inclusion of writing in everything we do. \n\nBut sometimes it hits me that I might not really give a shit about writing, teaching writing, or improving curriculum to include more writing. \n\nI'm passionate about my hobbies. I love playing guitar. I love running, hiking, and lifting weights. I would switch to any of those in a heartbeat if it paid a respectable salary. \n\nBut I'm putting in a lot of time, effort, and energy into studying writing. \n\nI hear some people speak of these dramatic personal stories where they found their passion for the research topic. I *sort of* have that. I did experiment with some writing activities when I first started teaching high school 15 years ago. Mostly because I was struggling with the way my school was teaching English: read some old, classic complex text; lecture about literary elements; and take a multiple choice test. Writing sparked things a bit. \n\nBut then when I was looking for a way out of teaching, I decided to go back to school on fellowship to get my master's in English. I had an undergraduate degree in secondary education, and I was advised to either get a master's in English or build a personal portfolio to apply to other jobs. The master's program I applied to had a strong technical writing department, so I decided to get the MA on fellowship (no debt plus a stipend and college teaching experience). \n\nThey wanted a personal statement when applying, so I like anyone applying to something they want exaggerated my experience with teaching writing. Writing was *magical* if you read my personal statement. I mean, I saw some positives, and I definitely thought highly of what writing could do in the classroom. But it wasn't like a dream or passion of mine to transform education. \n\nIn my master's program, I got pulled into some really cool research projects, one of which was with the provost himself. They gave me a lot of advice and showed me what life could be as an academic, and I thought it sounded great. Tenure track job that focused on research, had a flexible schedule, paid decently with the opportunity for upward mobility, and included a little bit of teaching? Sign me the hell up!\n\nSo I crafted my PhD applications the same way I did my master's: here's what's *magical* about writing. I don't get to brag about much in my life, but I can say that out of the 8 PhD programs I applied to, I batted 1.000. \n\nNow here I am studying writing, research methods, and the field of education with the intention of obtaining a tenure track position, and I don't know if any of what I'm doing is authentic. I am doing good work. I believe in the work. I believe I can make an impact with this stuff. \n\nBut the word \"passion\" doesn't really apply. At least not in my day-to-day. When I get around to applying for tenure track positions? That passion will show back up. \n\nIs this normal?",

        "text": "Hello! I’m a 19yr old (soon to be 20) second year MBBS student and I’m studying abroad in Turkiye and I’m in my second semester of this year (4th semester overall)\n-\nI grew up in a middle eastern country, specifically a country of the gulf so it was very diverse. I had it really easy in high school and most of my life, as I never had to step out of my comfort zone when it came to language. Everyone either speaks English or Arabic, which conveniently are the 2 languages I am fluent in. Except for French classes (that I actually still remember quite a bit from), I never really had to push myself to learn a new language\n-\nNow I know it is completely my fault for not taking learning Turkish seriously from last year around, and I do know that I’ve already wasted quite a bit of time but the one thing standing between me and a comfortable living in Turkiye is the language barrier\n-\nAlso I do know just enough to get around \n\nFor example, I know most if not all greeting phrases, I know some verbs and nouns here and there, I understand the general structure of how sentences are put in, and I know basic grammar\nLet’s just say the farthest I could get is a pleasant exchange at the cash register at a supermarket (where I can answer questions like do you have a membership card, would you like a plastic bag, are you paying cash or card etc) or ordering something at a restaurant with reasonable ease\n-\nAs of the recent devastating events (Geçmiş olsun Türkiye), all university classes have been switched to distanced learning, where the decision is to be reconsidered until April\n-\nNow I have all the resources, I have the textbook for A1 Turkish language, I have more time, and a friend of mine even gave me a link to a drive with recorded Turkish lessons, I have 0 excuses\n-\n I was thinking that if I really put my mind to it and really work on it, maybe I could become at least comfortable at conversing in Turkish by the time I return to Turkiye in the case that face to face classes resume\n\nI also want to note that whether we do return to face to face learning or not, whether I do return to Turkiye in April or not, I must learn Turkish there is no other option I pretty much live there and will need it before 3rd year starts, which is when we’ll be starting clinical rotations (AKA Turkish conversations WILL occur around me and I need to know what’s going on if I want to be a good doctor)\n\nIf I cannot achieve a comfortable level in these 7 weeks, then I don’t know what I would do-\nI already feel pretty hopeless (and disappointed in myself tbh) and like its impossible\nI just want to know if it’s realistic and what exactly I should focus on if I want to get to that level\n\n\nSo, is this possible? And how far can I realistically get?\n\nI appreciate any and all tips I could get\n\nThank you!",
