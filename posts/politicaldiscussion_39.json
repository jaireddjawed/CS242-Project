The stakes couldn't be higher; a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court may rest on whose account senators believe. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they plan to follow the hearings closely, with many yet to make up their minds, according to an NPR-PBS Newshour-Marist poll.

The US government will be collecting those increased prices almost as a new tax on them for most Chinese goods.  So it means that in the end the American people are paying more to the American government.  The hypothetical trade off is that manufacturing jobs, i.e. the things that have been made in China will start being made in America.\n\n\nHow can we know if this is working? How can we measure this, as GDP is too broad? Realistically how many manufacturing jobs could return to make it worth it? How long will it take?  If those jobs return will we need to maintain the tariff's increased cost to American consumers indefinitely to preserve those jobs, or could they eventually compete with global markets without the added cost of tariffs to the American people?\n\n\nAre there any goals, timelines, cost benefit analysis, or other criteria for success to determine the value of the trade war for the American people, and determine if the plan is working or not?       \n\n\n\n",

What are some kinds of rulings that we will likely see and what impact will those have on the country and those who live here?\n\nTalk of this issue doesn't seem to adequately address just how this majority will change America as we've come to know it and I was just curious about hearing from those who may be educated on the subject just what we might be looking at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
