        "text": "I'm designing a Panzer IV frame in Solidoworks as I'd like to make one someday and was looking for feedback on it if possible. Overall, the tank is \\~6m long, \\~3m high and \\~3m wide.  \n\n\n I'm designing it (roughly) as if it was going to be made, so most of the frame is made of 40mmx40mm steel tube with a 4mm wall thickness. The thicker chassis legs are made form 120x80mm steel box, with a wall thickness of 6mm. I'm not too worried about it being technically correct, just working. Some points;  \n\n\nThe chassis is doubled up with an angular support where the roadwheels and suspension attaches to help cope with stresses. The holes are for suspension attachment tests.   \n\n\nDesigned in 3 separate, easier to fabricate pieces.\n\n \n\nIn my head, the weight of the vehicle is distrubuted down the trianguar supports at the side and nicely into the suspension, but it's mostly guesswork so far. Historical accuracvy isn't 100%, but it's not far off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAppreciate the feedback!",

The problem I'm facing is that the yaw reading experiences a \\*mostly linear\\* error after pitching the device beyond a specific threshold. (About 50 degrees or so).\n\n**tl;dr:** **I would love any guidance in understanding what could cause the yaw reading to deviate after some threshold of roll in a 6DoF system.**\n\nTo better illustrate the problem, I've designed this simple experiment.\n\n* Fix the horizontal axis of the telescope (x-axis) so that it does not move\n* Slowly tilt the telescope upwards (along the y-axis)\n* Review the roll (y) and yaw (x) readings\n\n**Expected behavior -** The yaw reading should remain constant for the duration of the experiment, since there is no movement along the x-axis of the telescope.\n\n**Observed behavior -** After some threshold of roll (in my experiment, 50 degrees), the yaw reading begins to deviate in a linear fashion.\n\n*If you are interested in seeing a video of this experiment, I recorded one:* [https://joshcole.dev/telescope-error.mp4](https://joshcole.dev/telescope-error.mp4)\n\n**A few gotchas**\n\n* The sensor is mounted at a 45 degree angle relative to earth-horizon.\n* The sensor does not have hard/soft iron calibration applied.\n   * Although I did try to do this, it didn't make any discernible difference in this particular error.\n\n**The Math**\n\nPitch needs that extra negative sign for some reason, based on how the accelerometer is mounted I suppose.\n\n    pitch = -atan2(-accX, sqrt(accY^2 * accZ^2))\n    roll = atan2(accY, accZ)\n    \n    xHor = magX * cos(pitch) + magY * sin(roll) * sin(pitch) - magZ * cos(roll) * sin(pitch)\n    yHor = magY * cos(roll) + magZ * sin(roll)  \n    yaw = atan2(yHor, xHor)\n\n**My hypothesis**\n\nI suspect it is one of a few possibilities:\n\n* The math needs to account for how the sensor is mounted.\n* I calibrated it wrong.\n* This tilt threshold is actually the polar region of the sensors which can't handle that zone of readings.\n* At some point, the x/y/z angles get flipped.\n\n**Some specific questions**:\n\n* Can the mounting angle affect the euler angles given the formulas I'm using?\n* Can improper calibration cause this issue?\n* Any other advice on what to investigate (or learn) to better understand the physics of what's happening?\n\nI've been working on this project for about 2.5 years now and this is one of my remaining problems to overcome. I'm happy to dive deep into whatever subject I need to learn in order to solve this, but I'm at a total loss as to where I should spend my time. Do I need to understand the trig better? Is it a calibration issue? Just having an idea of what to focus my energies on would be very helpful. Thanks for your time!",

The reasoning being that the wires must be free to move inside the cable chain. I was confused by this as the cable sleeving wouldn't restrict the ability for the wires to move.\n\nThe reason I wanted to do this is there are many connector pairs with between 2-4 wires between that will be going into the cable chain and they are very likely to get tangled. What I would want to do is use a cable sleeve (that is heatshrunk at both ends) to individually sleeve each connector wire bundle. \n\nTo be clear this would not be putting every single wire in the cable chain inside a single sleeve. [Here is an example of what I mean](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performance-pcs.com%2Fcables%2Finternal-power-cables%2Ffloppy-to-4-pin-molex-adapter-custom-length-cable-sleeved-flop2molex-c.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw2RT9cpA0v5kMqt8kC0kDv1&amp;ust=1678162826954000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCLDs0uu5xv0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN). There would be multiple of those sleeved wire runs in the cable, each sleeve containing only the wires between a connector pair. As such I don't see how this would affect the ability for the wires to move inside the cable chain.",

        "text": "As the [photos](https://postimg.cc/gallery/fTY1nJL) show, I have a climbing wall lying in two sections, on the floor of my barn. The two halves each weigh 150kg.\n\nUsing the 5:1 pulley system shown, I want to slide the half with the joining members attached, onto the other half, and join the two halves by screwing the joining members onto the latter half.\n\nNext, I want to erect the climbing wall by using the pulley to raise it until it's as high as it can get. Allowing space for the pulleys and ropes (which will get bunched up and limit the height of the wall) I estimate the final angle of the climbing wall to be 25 degrees off vertical, give or take. That's more than enough to tax an unfit climber like me!\n\nAs you can see in the photos, the central anchor point is supported by roof beams to the left and right, in a ‘Y’ configuration. Could see no other way to arrange the anchors, given the constraints of where the climbing wall had to be placed, and the available roof-beam anchors. \n\nThe dimensions of the roof beams are 145 x 45 mm (approx 6x2 inches).\n\nThe angle subtended at the central anchor by the nylon slings/webbing to the roof beams, is almost exactly 90 degrees which means that the force on each of the two roof-beam anchors will not exceed 70% of the weight of the climbing wall, according to the best information I could find. The webbing/slings are rated at 2,200 kg.\n\nWhen the climbing wall is set at its highest point, I think that the forces on the roof-beam anchors will be well within their limits as most of the weight will be acting downwards, and there will also be supporting anchors attached to roof beams at each end of the climbing wall, connected by chains.\n\nMy main concern is this: when the climbing wall is fully assembled on the floor, and weighs 300kg, will 70% of that weight be too much lateral force on the roof beams?\n\nMany thanks for any thoughts on this.",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nSo I graduated with my BS, went straight into my MS, finished that about a year ago and have been working for a (successful majority engineers) renewable energy developer as a staff-level project engineer for about 9 months. We have performance reviews this week, and luckily I’ve gotten early indicators that I’ve exceeded expectations. I also currently work on one of the most important projects in the company’s portfolio, so I believe I’ve solidified the fact that I’m valuable/will continue to grow in value.\n\nThe company and my team in general is young in age, average around 27-28 years old. There are three others engineers, two on my team, who were hired the same time as me. The two on my team were fresh out of undergrad, the other actually graduated his MS with me at the same university and we started together. We all got the same starting salary offer (lower than the median for the industry by about 10%) and position. None of us had industry experience past some internships, but my MS friend and I have discussed the fact that our MS degrees didn’t get us a bump in starting pay. Side note, the staff is pretty open about sharing salary info, generally a good company culture about that stuff, that’s how we know.\n\nMy question is regarding salary and raises. I’m expecting a raise from the performance review, possibly a promotion (the company is pretty clockwork with yearly promotions of entire staff). We also get yearly bonuses. I want to be compensated for the fact that I have an upper level degree, but not sure how to go about it. I don’t think it’s prudent to compare myself to teammates or bring up anyone else’s pay, obviously. I do believe I’ve been given more responsibility, and performed higher as a result, than the other new hires, but who knows if that’s because of my MS. I am prepared to offer examples of how my MS degree has translated into high performance at my job. But not sure how to approach the conversation during the review with my manager, what %’s to throw out if asked about raises for the MS, etc.\n\nI honestly just think the fact that I have an MS directly related to the field should be respected in my pay. I was thinking of approaching it from a standpoint of : “I know giving me a higher salary without industry experience would have been risky, but I’ve performed highly for the last 9 months and now think it’s fair to recognize my graduate degree, etc etc.” Any advice or experience would be much appreciated. Is this even a reasonable ask? I really don’t feel like an MS in engineering should have been this much of a financial gamble, it’s always seemed like industry standard to get a higher salary. I just want to address this earlier rather than later. Relationship with manager is very good and communicative, generally on our side, but these salary decisions come from higher up. Sorry for the length, trying to be thorough",

        "text": "So I live in Belgium and for my last year of highschool I need to make some kind of end work. A study of something basically. \n\nI was thinking of doing something on people’s heights as it relates to foot placement for a deadlift. \n\nFor the uninitiated there are 2 variations on a deadlift depending on foot placement. Usually shorter, lighter lifters tend to put their feet closer while taller, heavier lifters tend to stay within the with of their hips. \n\nFor this study I will need a way to consistently simulate deadlifts in the same way while still being able to change things such as length. I was thinking of making a wooden model using hinges for joints. \nBut I have one issue and that is the muscles. \n\nI have no history in biomechanics and even less in making a functioning muscle. So if there are any people here that would have an idea on how to reliably simulate the action of a contracting muscle and be able to know how much energy it had to deliver than ideas suggestions and information would be very helpful. \n\nAlso please do keep in mind I have to pay for all this myself ;)",
