I feel like the motivation is not a distancing from ideology, but an Catch-22 situation where marketability and ideology sort of force him into a postmodernist-esque style.",

        "text": "A peculiar aspect I noticed about *Molly's Game* is that the director Aaron Sorkin really wants the audience to like Molly and think she's a good person.  Idris Elba's character (Molly's lawyer) says that Molly should be on a box of Wheaties, he says that his daughter told him that she wants to be like Molly, he gives an impassioned speech to the prosecuting lawyers about how Molly is fundamentally a good person and doesn't deserve to be harassed by the law like she is.  So there's a couple of weird things about this.\n\n**1)**  Molly as portrayed in the movie without any commentary by Molly or her lawyer is not a bad person already.  But she's not a good person, she's just really crafty and resourceful.  She gets hit with a career-ending injury as she performs in the Olympics, and gets stuck with a crappy job that we can sympathize with her about.  She eventually gets drawn into the world of illegal high stakes poker games as a helper before running gambling rings on her own.  We as the audience have been asked to sympathize with worse people like Don Corleone, Tony Montana, Walter White and so on.  \n\nBut Sorkin seems to want to paint her lifestyle as traditionally noble, while what I get from it is that Molly found a really easy way to make a lot of money and she ran with it.  \n\n**2)**Then there's the matter of the mobsters.  Early in the movie it's revealed that several of Molly's regular clients were Russian mobsters that were using her gambling rings as a way to launder money and Molly's lawyer is initially suspicious that she knew about them and was okay with the practice.  But Molly insists that she didn't know and it's shortly dropped afterwards as a plot point.  The movie makes a point of showing that Molly will research her clientele and has a head for numbers and tracing money, so her not knowing that she was helping mobster laundering money is implausible to me.  It's strange that Sorkin doesn't spend more time on this moral duplicity Molly might've been engaged in.  I thought that there was going to be a twist near the end of the movie that Molly played her lawyer like she played most of the men in her life and she was actually an amoral gambling queenpin.\n\n**TL;DR Did anyone else think it was weird how much *Molly's Game* spent on trying to convince the audience that Molly was a good person and not merely a harmless person?**\n\nEdit:  Why all the downvotes?  Just want to talk about a movie.",

Not so much from a box office or money perspective, but from stories and characters. \n\nIn my head I was running back and forth with movies that were better bc of their rating and then those that would have succeeded regardless of rating. For example, the last Wolverine movie ‘Logan’ was better because it was rated R. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. have all been amazing and I think a changing in rating would do nothing for them. In fact, an R rating may make those movies worse.\n\nLooking at those examples, one thrives because the R rating aligns with the true form of the character. The latter would perhaps be worse for a change in rating because of the story itself.\n\nAgain, there are thousands of examples where you could say one would benefit from a different rating while the other would not.\n\nSo the question becomes, what effect does the rating of a movie have for you? Why? What are some examples that work in your favor?",

And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.*\n- Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nKuso presents us an array of short stories set in a dystopian future where the world has been dominated by fungi. The stories are held together with a masterful combination of Flying Lotus’ music and a psychedelic dive into a chaos of the repulsive and obscene. One may object the intrusion of such elements, but art must often push the boundaries of its language to achieve the meaning it tries to convey.\n\nThis allows Kuso to explore the use of symbols that are traditionally excluded from film: semen, excrement, genitalia, etc. The constant appearance of these elements soon detaches them from our reactions of disgust, enabling them to persist in their pure symbolic character which is especially rich when we consider it from the depths of the subconscious. It's worth noting that these brief glimpses of meaning occur on a consistent frame of hilarious absurd.\n\nThe film starts with a musical piece that informs us of a massive earthquake that hit Los Angeles, warning us that “our god is from the underground”. We can then think of Kuso as an eschatology, a grim prediction of the end that looks into the psychotic abyss of our time, allowing it to look back at us in plain sight.\n\nDoing an analysis of the stories is a hard task. If we try to express what they mean we would be forced to psychoanalyze ourselves first, something that is beyond our possibilities. We can, however, highlight certain interesting elements such as the fetishist tension between sex and death in “Royal” and the figure of the father in “Smear” which is literally built out of excrement by the son. \n\nThe film thus remains a respectable experiment that pushes its medium’s boundaries. This allows it to explore today’s silent taboos and achieve strong cathartic possibilities for the audience.",

All About Lily Chou-Chou is a movie I like to describe as \"a Miyazaki film if Myiazaki was a live action director and was a bit insane\". Those who watched it may find my description a bit absurd and those who have not may go watch it with high expectations.\n I can justify my description because if you look up to many of the movie's scenes,they're completely contemplative,with only the photography,the soundtrack(one of my favorites ever) and just isolation/emptyness of the characters to tell a great story;something that,as you may know,Myiazaki does better than anybody,with Chihiro's train ride,Sophie's rest time,etc.\n But the movie is also highly disturbing,as the violence that these teens experience is pretty rough and sad(that's why I think the \"Myiazaki\" in question should be insane). Shunji Iwai was able to reach me because of the Ghibli vibes he created during those highly contemplative and undescribably beautiful moments and the contrast with the brutality of other scenes and the plot in general.\n The movie is not perfect,it is a bit hard to follow the story and some scenes look a bit too amateurishly made,but I really enjoy it,it has one of my favorite photography works and the soundtrack is forever on my playlists.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8i1nvv/extensive_analysis_on_you_were_never_really_here/",
        "text": "Video Essay: https://youtu.be/bBuGGuPnp9o\n\nI apologize if the write-up is rather lengthy, but there was so much to say about the film.\n\nI found ‘You were never really there’ to be one of the most humanly jarring and enthralling cinema experiences that I’ve ever had. It’s a film that in my opinion does a perfect job at immersing and engaging its audience through the delicate and stylistic use of the aesthetics. It’s a film that’s both written and directed Lynne Ramsey who happens to be a Scottish female director. You were never really here is a masterclass example of filmmaking that I believe is undeniably inspired by the movie Drive which is directed by Danish film director, Nicholas Winding Refn. They are still of course two distinctly different films that I find to be brilliant in their own way, but share a lot of the same elements of aesthetic immersion and conveyance of character and theme through visual storytelling. Something that I absolutely appreciate in a film, is its ability to creatively utilize film aesthetics to convey information without a single word being spoken. And You were Never Really Here knocks this outta the park.  The film is able to reveal and communicate character, plot, and thematic elements purely through the uses of sound and cinematography which of course the director Lynne Ramsay gets huge credit for. The use of sound in this movie is masterful and plays an essential part to its technique of aesthetic conveyance. The film allows the viewer to observe the actions of the main character while also putting you inside the mind of his character. This is a fairly new release so I’m currently unsure about what people might be confused about or what criticisms some might hold regarding the film, But I will do my best to analyze and interpret this film to the best of my ability. \n  \nLets begin by unpacking the main character named Joe who is of course played by Joaquin Phoenix who by the way just gives an outstanding and convincingly engaging performance. Joe is an extremely morally complex and troubled character that demands the audience to think beyond the conventional good guy/bad guy dynamic in film. And like I stated earlier, it does an excellent job at conveying the complexities of his character by putting you inside his mind and allowing you to see and hear what he is thinking and feeling throughout the film.  The film begins with the sound of train tracks as it cuts to a subtle foreshadowing shot of an incredible underwater scene we get later in the film. We then hear some barely audible noise of some disturbing mumbling coming from Joe. It then cuts to a shot of him tightening his airways and edging himself through slight suffocation with a plastic bag. He then burns a picture of an Asian teenager and cleans the murder scene by wiping up all the blood and collecting left behind belongings. As soon as Joe shuts the door with the plastic bag of belongings in his hand, the daunting score slowly builds up as we can still only see bottom half of joe as he throws the plastic bag away. Not only is this an engaging introduction to the film through its immersive aesthetic techniques, but it also does an excellent job at demanding you to be immediately invested. Only a few seconds of the movie has been shown but its still manages to make your mind to wander and try and piece everything you just saw within those few seconds. To me, I believe this introduction is attempting to give you a false first impression of Joes character and is teasing our tendency to rapidly assess peoples moral character solely based on minimal pieces of evidence. As the film begins to unravel, we learn that the dirty work that joe does was much different than it may have seemed. He takes on jobs that require him to retrieve missing teenagers that have been kidnapped. which also ultimately requires him to kill the kidnapper and anybody that stands in the way of him completing his duty. You Were Never Really Here is a mental and moral dissection of a human being who suffers from some serious post traumatic stress. The film visually shows us what post traumatic events look, feel, and sound like and also shows the after effects that these traumatic stresses can have on a person. Joe lives with his elderly mother and does his best to take care of her. We eventually learn that his mother seems to be the only good person he has in his life. The first glimpse we get of one of the after effects of his post traumatic stress, is the early scene where he is seen at the edge of his bed as he conveys a discomforting facial expression. It cuts a quick image of a childs feet fidgeting in the sand. This sets the tone and structure of how the film chooses to convey information regarding Joe’s past. Throughout the entire film, there are moments where Joe feels anxiety when he finds himself in different situations, and each time he begins to experience some form of anxiety, the film abruptly cuts back to one or more of his traumatic memories. One other clever thing that the director Lynne Ramsay incorporated into this aspect of the film, is that the more intense and anxious he finds himself, the film tends to allow the flashbacks to go on for longer periods of time. We also observe later in the film that his mind also projects hallucinations and memories into the real world. To me, this was a genius choice to make. Because the anxiety of Joe’s character builds and builds as the film progresses which allows the film to slowly build his character and uncover his past inch by inch. SO back to the scene of Joe in his bedroom, we also see him teasing himself by putting a knife down his throat and by repeatedly dropping the knife towards his foot as he moves it away at the last second. This type of disorderly behavior is something that becomes apparent about his character throughout the film. He is seen edging pain and suicide either through plastic bag suffocation or slowly putting his head in front of a train and removing it at the last second. Joes mind is always on the thought of pain, violence, death or suicide. This is really just conveying the unfortunate and harsh reality of what goes on in the minds who fall victim to post traumatic stress disorder. It’s easy for victims of PTSD to fall in to depression and have difficulty functioning in a healthy way in society. And again, the film is able to thematically convey these notions aesthetically through its brilliant yet subtle direction.\n \n   Lets fastforward to the point where the film ultimate conflict beings to unravel. Joe takes another job from a senator that claims his daughter ran away and was abducted by a child sex ring. Joe is able to recover the girl by obtaining the security key code and bashing everybodys face in with a ball pein hammer which I thought was interestingly shot. The film decides to show his rescue through the CCT security cameras which I really thought added an element of realism to the scene. You can also hear happy childlike sounding music coming from the building as he kills the bodyguards and rescues the girl. The music here not only demonstrates the devastating reality of indoctrinated brainwash and perversion but it also creates a sense of contrast and irony to the context of the scene. We also see another devastating reality when we see a literal drugged up child that looks to be around the age of at least 8, walk out of the first room Joe entered. And also we’ve come to learn that joes choice of weapon which is the ball pein hammer, is influenced by his abusive and traumatic past. Throughout the film we get glimpses of his father holding a ball pein hammer as his weapon of abuse. This again conveys the realities of people who have traumatic pasts and how it subconciously becomes an essential part of their identity. Another example of this is Joes habit of edging suffocation and the way he puts wet cloth over his face as he prepares for acts of violence. Through eventual flashbacks we notice that this is something that is basically identical to what his father did before he abusively punished his children.\n\n  So When Joe eventually raids the room where the missing girl is found, We get a blurry shot of the girls face that slowly becomes more clearer as she lays motionless and unresponsive. We also hear her counting down from 40. This particular shot and scene takes place within the mind of the teenage girl. The teenage girl is unfortunately a victim of child sex trafficking. This results in her having to deal with being drugged up constantly, all day everyday for obvious reasons I shouldn’t have to explain.  Her counting down from 40 is her own way of keeping a mental note of how long she has until she is able to regain the valuable level of consciousness. This is apparent because when we see her reach the number one, the audio is no longer coming just from her head and is actually being physically vocalized. One really cool thing that I noticed about this scene, is that it cuts away from the scene where we hear her counting in her head to allow us to observe joe take care of a situation, it eventually cuts back to her where we can hear her counting down again. But whats really cool is that, is that her countdown is timed perfectly. Seriously if you pick up the countdown where it left off when the scene cuts away, it will be exactly on time with the films countdown when it cuts back to it. This is something that’s more fun than anything, but it really does show the preciseness and delicacy of Lynne Ramsays direction and execution.\n\nJoe takes the teenage girl named Nina back to a hotel where he made plans to rendezvous with the father. As Nina flips through the channels, a news story covers current breaking news of the senator committing suicide by plunging off a skyscraper. The young hotel worker knocks on the door and when Joe opens the door, a cop shoots the innocent boy in the head and gets one of his partners to carry Nina away. Joe catches the cop off guard and makes a quick decision to fight the cop to death. This to me is one of the many aesthetically jaw dropping moments in the film. As Joe and the cop fight and violently sling each other around, the audio of reality is silenced as we hear the unsettling score take over the scene. This is again, a great aesthetic way to express the way Joe is feeling and thinking throughout the scene. I love when films do this because to me it really immerses you into the moment that you’re watching unfold on screen. As they’re viciously fighting, the camera angle gets knocked over and points upward on a cracked mirror that reveals Joe strangling the cop and eventually snapping his neck. Once this is done, the audio of reality cuts in a tad bit as we hear Joes exhausted panting and breathing. And this might be overreaching im not quite sure, but to me the reflective image through a broken mirror of joe laying next to a corrupt cop he was forced to kill, symbolizes the reality of a broken man and a corrupt society and police institution. This is more than likely the point of the film that some people might’ve found themselves confused as to what exactly is occurring. I’ll explain everything very soon here I promise. \n\nI’m going to backtrack just for a second here and point out that the film does an excellent job at conveying Joes inner emotions and thought process when he prepares to fulfill his mission. Before he actually raids the child sex ring, we get a quick glimpse of him vomiting outside the door before he enters it. This is just a great visual character detail about how he truly feels about violence. It’s something that he doesn’t necessarily want to do, but his traumatic past has influenced him to be drawn towards violence. And also Before he began his job, it shows joe having bad anxiety attacks throughout his preparation. There’s a scene in particular where a group of asian girls ask him to take their picture. He attempts to take their picture but becomes petrified as he observes their faces. There is also a flashback that gets revealed later of an image of piles of dead asian bodies in the back of a truck as it zooms in on the face of one of the dead asian women. Im going to try and interpret this memorial aspect of his character. Remember at the beginning of the film when he burns the picture of the asian girl, throws it in the trash and uses the hotel bible to smother the flame? Perhaps on that mission, he was too late and the girl he was looking for was the dead girl that the camera zoomed in on within the pile of dead bodies; which of course was the unfortunate result of human trafficking. The belongings he collects in a bag in the room also resemble that of a teenage girl. One piece that stands out is the gliterry necklace that the camera focuses on for a second. So when he is asked to take a picture of these girls, He has an anxiety triggered episode. Because again, those who fall victim to PTSD have difficulty functioning normally in society because they just have a more daunting view of the world due to their traumatic past. When he sees this girl, he thinks of the girl that he wished he could’ve saved but couldn’t, and also thinks about what could’ve been if he had saved her.\n\n  After that traumatic ordeal, Joe goes on a search for answers and unfortunately discovers that everybody that he is linked to has been murdered. At this point he starts to have a pretty intense Anxiety episode as hes driving around the city. We start hearing that disturbing mumbling audio again and if I were to try and make out what its saying, it seems to be the words of his father towards him. To me it sounds like his father is calling him a pussy and to stop slouching. And in this particular scene with him driving around in the car, he sits up straight when he hears the mumbling. So I kind of just put two and two together there. I’m not 100% on this but it seems plausible enough to interpret it this way. I also believe that this is the point where his traumatic military past becomes uncovered and we get an answer to what the fidgeting feet in the sand flashback was about. So in this quick subtle flashback, we see Joe  give a candy bar to one of the foreign children. But a few seconds later, the child gets shot and killed by a teenager of the same foreign descent in order to steal the candy bar that Joe just gave her. So the feet that we’ve seen fidgeting in the sand, is the last moments of a child that he indirectly contributed to the death of.\n \nSo he eventually sneaks into his own house and unfortunately stumbles upon his mother who has been shot in the head. He hears movement going on downstairs and begins to slowly approach the noise. This is one clear example of the film unveiling more of his past as his anxiety beings to elevate. It’s done in this because again, the film is recreating whats going on inside the mind of our main character joe. He takes two shots  kills one intruder but accidentally leaves the other one critically wounded but still alive. The wounded intruder helplessly crawls towards the kitchen as joe stops him and asks for answers regarding his mother and Nina which again is the teenage girl he tried to rescue. The intruder is able to say a few things and mentions that his mother was asleep when his friend pulled the trigger and that Nina is the governors favorite one and trades her around. The notion of his mother being asleep when they shot her may seem comforting on the surface. But when I first heard this pjece of dialogue, I immediately thought back to beginning scene where Joe comes back from his mission and sees his mother sleeping in the living room. His mother laughs as she jokes about how she got him again. This shows that the mother tends to joke with him about pretending to be asleep when shes really not. So bringing it back to the current scene, its possible that the mother wasn’t actually asleep and just pretended that she was because she assumed that the movement she heard in the house was Joe. Kind of a downer, but just thought it was something to think about. The other thing the intruder mentions is that the governor likes to trade them but Nina is his favorite. So at this point, im going to go ahead and just explain the films plot conflict for anybody who seemed to be confused at this point. So basically how this whole cluster of shit began, was because the senator that asked Joe to retrieve his daughter from the child sex ring, was full of crap. He allegedly claimed that Nina was his daughter that ran away from home and got kidnapped, but in reality, he is just a disgusting powerful politician who voluntarily involves himself in child sex trafficking. Some sort of conflict occurred between the governor and the senator to where the senator probably lost some sort of privilege to use Nina for sex. So the senator got despicably butthurt and sent joe on a selfish false mission in order to try and retrieve Nina for himself. Its similar to Refns Drive in the sense that the main character is lied to about the specifications about an illegal job and ends up paying the consequences by getting caught up in something that was way larger than what he thought. So when the governor finds out that his sex ring has been infiltrated and his favorite possession Nina has been taken, He sicks his paid security policeman to kill everyone who is a possible link and retrieve her back. Its disgusting political corruption at its finest. \n\n  SO going back to the scene with the helpless intruder in the kitchen, Joe decides to give him some pain medication. Not only does he do that, but he lays down with him on the ground as they both begin to hum a song that’s playing in the background. The wounded intruder reaches for joes for comfort and Joe willingly holds his grippingly as he dies. This is just a wonderful and insightful character moment for Joe. This scene truly conveys that Joe has a good heart.  He has mercy. I mean the guy who hes help giving a peaceful death just helped somebody kill his mother, and he still has mercy and pity for him to the point where he is willing to give the guy a peaceful send off.\n\n     Joe wraps his mothers body up in a bag and drives out to a lake. He stuffs his suit with large rocks and slowly walks out into the lake with his mother in his hands with the intention of drowning and dying with her body. And then ensues one of the most cinematically captivating scenes that I’ve ever experienced in a movie theatre. It was a scene that to me at first didn’t seem like it was going to amount to something big, but as it slowly progresses it just turned into something that I found to be emotionally euphoric and mesmerizing. We get an astonishing slow moving shot of Joe slowly sinking deeper into the lake with his dead mother in his arms. He eventually lets go of his mother as he sees her plummet further and further into the lake. This entire scene is accompanied by an emotionally hypnotizing score by Jonny Greenwood and we also hear interchangeable whispers of his mother and himself. The sheer execution of this scene through excellent and creative uses of direction, cinematography and sound truly captured the emotions of joe. It captures the overhwhelming amount of despair, loneliness and blissful peace he is experiencing during his attempted suicide. We hear joes voice begin a countdown in his head as the audio transitions from joes voice to Ninas voice. He hallucinates an image of Ninas dead body sinking further and further into the lake. This is when Joe comes to the realization that he is unable to achieve a peaceful death. He realizes that if he drowns, then nina drowns which is why see an image of nina slowly falling to the bottom of the lake. Joe quickly removes all of the stones in his pockets and fights to the surface. It quickly cuts to an image of Nina also fighting to the surface of the lake.  Because again, as long as Joe is alive, Nina has a chance of survival. \n\n  Joe then immediately sets on his mission to find the governor and kill him in order to retrieve Nina . While Joe in on the subway look at his reflection, we get a quick cut that revelas an image of the senator gently and sensually touching ninas bare back as the governor walks into the room. This quick bit of visual information is supposed to give more clarity to the audience of what is actually occurring in the plots conflict. Joe follows the governors tracks and it leads him to his mansion estate. Joe kills I believe kills two different body guards but the film does not actually show him in the act of doing it. The film is directed in a way where it doesn’t show you anything that it feels is unnecessary to show. It just shows a few glimpses of them lying dead on the ground. And again, the way the film is able to convey so much substantive information purely through visual means is an impressive feat that should be appreciated by film lovers. Joe follows the same  happy child-like music that was playing earlier in the film during the raid that was captured through the CCT security cameras as he makes his way towards the governors room. Once he arrives and moves through the doorframe, he notices the governors dead body on the ground with his throat slit. Joe first gently chuckles at this but then begins to have an intense emotional breakdown which was brilliantly acted by Joaquin Phoenix. This is such a breathtaking performance and breathtaking moment for Joe. He breaksdown because at this moment, he strongly feels that his mission was carried out in vain. The entire reason why he decided to go back on his suicide attempt was because he thought he was the only way he could save her. And that turned out to not necessarily be true. He gave up a peaceful death with his mother with the hopes that he would be the one to protect her.  I believe that he also didn’t want her to physically engage in violence at a young age. I believe that Joe sees a lot of himself in Nina. They are similar in the sense that they both share the harsh reality of experiencing severely harmful and traumatic events during their early stages of life. He didn’t want her to do something as violent as slitting somebodys throat because he knows that that’s gong to be another image that she will carry for the rest of her life that will haunt her in the same way that Joes memories haunt him. Joe Musters up the courage to explore the rest of the house in search for Nina . He hears a loud thud in the house and begins to follow it. The audio here transitions from a real thud into a hallucinating and repeating thud sounds. This is another clear example of anxiety based flashbacks and projections that are occurring the more his anxiety elevates. He sees his mother for a glimpse and sees his father with a wet cloth over his head. We also get another image of him as a young boy breathing inside of a plastic bag in the closet as he hears the loud shrieks of his mother screaming. He finally discovers Nina at the dining table eating some food with blood all over her hands and food. And shes most likely using the same knife she used to slit the governors throat with. Joe calmy approaches as he puts his hand on her shoulder while his face shows true concern and devastation. She looks down at him and simply tells him that its okay. \n\n  This is now where we get the conclusory scene of the film where we see joe and nina accompanying each other at a diner. He asks her a question about what she wants to do. She gets up and walks away somewhere without warning and it shocks joe with a hopeless feeling of “why did I bother doing any of this”. The camera lingers on his face while the audio of the meaningless chit chatter from the patrons of the restaurant intensifies. Eventually Joe takes out a handgun and shoots himself in the head. Not a single person in the restaurant pays mind to it. The waitress with blood on her face drops the check off as she looks directly at joes bloodied body and says “have a nice day”. Nina comes around the corner as she sees Joes head resting on the table, completely unscathed. This to me is obviously conveying that his suicide was a day dream hallucination. The reason why nobody paid any attention to joes suicide in the diner, is because its meant to represent the nature of humanity. In reality, when tragic things happen, people just keep it moving and go on living their lives. Whenever we hear an important issue or  story in the news whether its about a murder, a suicide, child trafficking, terrorism, child abuse, military affairs, we as humans just keep it moving and more than likely don’t do anything to help the issue in any way. Nina suggests that they should go somewhere because it’s a beautiful day. Joe agrees with this. Sips the remainder of his drink, and the film ends. \n\nYou Were Never Really was truly a blast to analyze. I truly believe that this film is a masterpiece of art-house filmmaking and it gave me an unforgettable and mesmerizing movie theater experience and I give an enormous amount of appreciation and thanks to the writer and director Lynne Ramsey for creating such a uniquely enthralling film. I’m sure that there are still plenty of things in this film that I did not touch on or perhaps interpreted incorrectly, but this is precisely the reason why I love film like this. I love the amount of ample discussion and debate that a film like this can generate. If there is anything you would like to criticize or add to this analysis please let it be known! ",

        "text": "If you prefer to see this in video and audio format, see here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oaj0EIV-hJw\n\nJurassic World producer Frank Marshall recently made the following comments about the upcoming Fallen Kingdom movie:\n\n \n\n*I think since Jurassic Park we’ve got more animatronics than any of the other movies. Except Jurassic Park.*\n\n \n\nThe quote and the hyped up reaction it got kind of irked me, because it’s simply a businessman with a vested interest promoting his product and there’s no reason why his claims should hold any merit, which I made a video on.\n\n \n\nBut there’s also something else this got me thinking about. Something related more to audiences and critic’s reaction to blockbusters in general than anything specific to Jurassic World.\n\n \n\nLet’s say the producer is telling the truth, and there are more animatronics in Jurassic World 2 than in any other movie in the franchise bar the original. Forget the quality of the animatronics, how good they look, how well they move, how real they look. Let’s just forget about that for a second and agree that there will be more. So what? So what if there are more animatronics than in previous films? In what way is this something that is praiseworthy? Why is the producer tapping himself on the back here? The fact that they’ve used animatronics is not worthy of notice – what matters is how good it looks in the film. Heck the animatronics could be terrible like the Apatosaurus in the previous film.\n\n \n\nI mentioned in previous video how this was quite obviously a producer’s way of building hype and putting bums in seats. I’m more concerned here with after those bums have left the seats.  The Hollywood people do this intentionally of course because they are trying to generate income, but I think that today movie audiences and critics tend to praise and overpraise movies for doing things that movies have been doing for yonks. Frank Marshall believes that saying Fallen Kingdom will have lots of practical effects is worth shouting about, Colin Trevorrow seemed to think telling people his Jurassic World will be shot of film and not digital is worth mentioning. Well guess what guys, another film had done both of these things and it was called Jurassic Park, and it is an all-time classic but the fact that it had animatronics and was shot on film were not the only reasons, not even the primary reasons – they were one of the few elements that definitely added to the film, but about the script, the acting, the pacing, the tension and having one of the most talented directors around in his prime building a visual rollercoaster ride for audiences?\n\n \n\nBut I guarantee that when Fallen Kingdom comes out, if it does have a lot of practical effects people will point fingers to the practical effects and say that’s why I loved Fallen Kingdom, because it had practical effects. Well did you also like Troll 2 and Howard the Duck because those films also had practical effects?\n\n \n\nLook, I know the argument is much more complicated than that, and more than anything you have to look at how good the effects on screen are, regardless of whether they are practical or CGI. After all, isn’t the best CG when you don’t notice it’s CGI? How the effects were applied should have no weight over your opinion of a film, how well they applied should.\n\n \n\nEven as a massive advocate of practical effects I can’t help rolling my eyes when a film sells itself on having practical effects or, more importantly to me because the audience’s opinions mean pretty much everything, when a film is given a pass because it has practical effects. Take The Void, a film with a messy plot and odd ending. It wasn’t particularly memorable and petty silly but look at reactions online and you’ll see that many were quick to praise the film and overlook its faults because it had practical effects, even though the practical effects weren’t all that great. They aren’t doing anything new, they haven’t created some new form of technology, they’ve just been doing what film-makers have been doing since A Trip to the Moon and earlier, and yet certain films are getting a pass because they simply have practical effects.\n\n \n\nLook at James Cameron’s Avatar. It’s often accused of being  a pretty Dances with Wolves rip off, with backlash being amplified by the fact that all of the effects are digital and haven’t aged too well. If anything, we should be praising the effects in that film, because Cameron DID actually create new technology and in doing so propelled movie-making tools into further advancement.\n\n \n\nI just feel that I think within the past few years I’m starting to see loads of films that get praised for things that film-makers were doing anyway since, well, since films were made. When a building was made to explode in Lethal Weapon 3, did everyone go on about how that was a real explosion and how brilliant it was? Not really no. But a lot was made about the explosion at the end of Spectre being real and not CGI. The Alien Covenant cast were chased by real men in alien suits, as they constantly told us before the film came out? Well, so what, so were the original cast 40 years ago!\n\n \n\nMad Max Fury Road is an interesting one. It is constantly praised for its car chase scenes which were all practical effects and had no CGI. That’s not true by the way it actually had a lot of CGI, but it was so good most didn’t notice it. Anyway, much of the praise was because the chases were practical, when in fact it should have been because the chases where exhilarating, engaging, and adrenaline-rushing. I wonder if the original Mad Max movies were presented with this much praise just for having practical effects? Of course not, because back then there was very little alternative. But my point is today you see loads and loads of praise heaped on a film just because it did something for real. Film-makers know this and go out of their way to say during marketing that their film has practical effects, like having animatronics is some kind of sympathy token, a get-out-of-jail card. It’s the same with, say, movie not using CGI blood and opting for squibs, or not using shakey cam. It’s great, and I’m a big fan of when it’s done, but why the extra praise when people have been working this way for years? All that effort that went unpraised even in your standard 80’s action movie or crappy B movie horror flick, because that was the standard of film-making back then.\n\n \n\nIt’s not just effects either. Look at the recent Black Panther film. Was it praised for being a good superhero movie (whether it was or it wasn’t a good oneI can’t say as I haven’t seen it). Not really – most of the praise was at how progressive it was since it was one of the first major blockbusters to have black people in main roles. That was the main marketing gimmick of the film, as if Hollywood attempted to pretend  they weren’t making a movie aimed to make millions of dollars and were instead performing a public service. But again the film gained almost unanimous praise for its cast being black and not the quality of the film. Excuse me, what about Blade, what about Candyman, what about Hancock, Spawn, Coming to America, Bad Boys and the countless other films that had black people in major roles that did not sell themselves or were praised solely because of the fact that they had black people.\n\n \n\nGender equality is another issue. Some film makers get so caught up in the idea of strong independent woman that they forget they are making a movie and not an advertisement for feminism, and often derail their films in doing so. Anyway, that’s an argument for another day, but when a modern movie like Wonder Woman or The Hunger Games gets praised for having strong characters, so much so even in poor movies, which leads me to think that some people are too afraid of calling a decent movie decent or a mediocre movie mediocre and have to overpraise in fear of being called misogynist – it’s as if Sarah Connor, Nurse Ratchet,  Ellen Ripley, The Bride, Leia Organa, Clarice Starling, Dorothy Gale and Phyllis Dietrichson never existed. These new movies aren’t doing anything new by parading the phrase ‘strong independent woman’ in their PR interviews, strong independent women have always existed in film.\n\n \n\nI’ll tell you what I think one of the worst offenders is – The Artist. This was a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it. It was funny and whimsical and yes, the black and white added a vintage touch. But critics at the time were going crazy over the fact that it was a black and white and silent film in the modern age and how that made it nostalgic and memories and yada yada yada. The fact is, why should it have gotten extra praise because it was silent? If you lifted this film and placed it into the era of silent movies like Metropolis and City Lights would The Artist stand out much? I really don’t think so. Yes they recreated the look of a silent film but as a movie it wasn’t a lot better than your standard decent black and white film. Being silent worked for the film’s story so I won’t call it a gimmick, but it definitely was an aspect of the movie that gave it more than deserved praise, even landing it best picture. And I will say that The Artist was an OK film. But I will also say that The Artist won best picture because it was a silent film, which made it quirky and new.\n\n \n\nBut silent pictures are not new. And practical effects are not new. And neither are the inclusion of black people and strong women in movies. So I think audiences and critics need to take a step back sometimes when movies have these things and judge the films for their quality and quality alone.  ",

        "text": "So I finally watched this movie last night, and I’ve got to say that it actually impressed me quite a bit. Obviously I’ve heard from everyone how graphic and messed up the movie is, but I was trying to go in with somewhat of an open mind.\n\nFirst let me say, the brutality of this film is palpable, and I understand why people are turned off by it.\n\nHowever, if you can stomach the subject matter this is a great film. The camera work is dizzying at first, but as the film goes on it almost adds to the frantic tone of the movie. I noticed that as the film goes on, and becomes less and less chaotic the camera moves a lot less too. Personally I thought that was really cool.\n\nThe acting is great, especially considering that the actors did not have a lot to go on as far as lines. I read that Noe really just had an outline for the movie, and let the actors do their thing.\n\nI think this film is paced really well, and I loved the reverse narrative. It really makes the more calm/romantic scenes that more delicate.\n\nIt’s definitely not a fun movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it was definitely interesting.",

        "text": "If I posted in the wrong sub, I apologize, please do message me the right sub to post this in.\n\nI enjoy analyzing Music videos, movies and art ever since I was a young teen (since every English class I ever had was basically that...) and Wanted to share my analysis of \"[This is America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY)\".\n\nI believe the final stanza is the key to the entire interpretation. More on that later.\n\nOpening shot, lots of light, everything is contained inside a hanger\n\nThe ISO is pushed, lots of noise, the blacks are crushed (not at their full black values and are grey instead of black, same with the whites, they are never at their full values) This is not necessarily symbolic but a trick in photography when we want our photos to have a \"Analog / film\" feel. This is reinforced by how the corners are rounded and cut off, quite telling that he wants an Analog feel, like most of his videos. The Addition of the rounded corners / Vignetting looks a lot like diaporamas (He also later references Kodak pictures, as in the old tagline \"A kodak moment\")\n\nPerson being shot wears a distinct beige Dress shirt.\n\nThe depth of Field is VERY shallow. In all his other videos, the DOF is pretty deep most of the time, but here, we are looking at something absurdly wide open, f/3.2 or even f/2.8.\n\nThe reason is clear, HE is the sole focus, not the violence, cars driving by with guns in the air or the body being dragged away, HE is the only focus, look at HIM dancing and being happy.\n\nWhen the Children in School uniforms come in (With the Same Beige dress shirt, linking back to the guitar man, perhaps he was their teacher?) for the first time, despite dancing right behind him, they are not in focus. VERY shallow depth of field. But the point is clear, The teacher has been killed, the children are free to dance, uneducated, they run around, the scene slowly changes to broken down cars, animals in the street (trope of breakdown of civilization) and Children jumping on cars, throwing money around \n\nThe point with this, I believe, along with the lyrics (Police are Trpping, This is how I am living Now, Carrying Straps, guns, this is america, it's Guerrilla(warfare)) is that while there is a breakdown in civility all round, while the next generation is being broken, STILL the focus is on a Racial Sambo Stereotype; Dance, carefree, be happy. Ignore everything else, they are but ghosts and shadows, there is no problem.\n\nThe lyrics continue, I'm so cool, I'm so dope, The Schoolchildren come back into frame, dance with him, but NOW they are in focus, as they dance with him, they prefer his form of carefree education.\n\nMove to the Church choir scene, it shows music, dancing, heritage, community, and again, destruction of the image. The Message at this point is quite clear, with the shooting of the the Guitar man and the Choir, this is about the destruction of Values and them being replaced by a cult of the self (more on that later)\n\nDon't be caught slipping up, looking what we are building up (chaos all around, but again, out of focus.) A Multi ethnic crowd runs after each other (perhaps showing racial division?), but the SchoolChildren and CG are the only ones in focus, because look how Gucci they are, look how pretty I am, look at me move, Cellphone is my tool, Kodak (Moment) ==&gt; Shift to SchoolChildren in masks watching from above, Videotaping / Taking Pictures on their cellphones of the chaos below - LITERAL Kodak moments as there are literal fires at their back.\n\nGrowing Fame is more important than substance, fame is more important, but they are behind masks they put on themselves as everything breaks down around them.\n\nAnd lets not forget, we are still contained inside a Hanger.\n\nBack to the dancing Children - I am not sure what \"hundred bands\" means - Stacks of hundred dollar bills tied with rubber bands? Would make sense in conjunction with \"Contraband\" and \"Oxaca\" - which appears to be a drug fueled part of Mexico filled with ethnic / Indigenous peoples, tying back to the ethnicity focus of the video.\n\nCG/DG is in focus, pulls out a FAKE gun in front of the children while in focus and everybody runs (as opposed to real guns and everybody runs in), he is alone, he lights up. Still working a bit on that one. ~~Perhaps that threats and words are meaningless without action, and people follow those who appear strong rather than those who use threats and words.~~ [ADDED] Perhaps When he pulls out the fake gun, he is killed, which is why the children run away and everything goes silent. He then joins the dead man and climbs his pile of red. The blunt signifies that He is at peace and everything is then in full focus.\n\n\"You people owe me for the number of followers I have/am missing\" - tying back to the cult of the self, the cult of personality, greed and selfishness.\n\nHe Climbs ALONE up onto THE ONLY RED CAR in the entire video (Also seen right before Oxaca), symbolizing a mountain of blood/corpses and violence, all other cars are shades of White / Beige and in better condition. The Dead Guitar Man plays as A girl sits on a Foreign car, watching on. His Bloody fame is over, he \"has it all\" but everybody is gone from the scene, leaving only a dead man. [ADDED] To Quote \"Sweatpants\": \"Yeah you got some silverware but really are you eating though?\"\n\nEVERYTHING is in focus for the first time in the video.\n\nThe Camera exits the hanger for the first time, while looking at the scene. A Scene of Exuberance, yes, there are a lot of cars which are associated with wealth, but they are very poor cars. However, in the context of the contained hanger, that's still a lot of cars and is exuberance.\n\nAnd finally the key to the entire song / video / message\n\n\"Black people are but a barcode, all the same, just dogs, kenneled in the backyard.\"\n\nCG/DG runs from the darkness into the light\n\nWe see his face, he is SCARED as he tries to escape the Hanger ==&gt; Kennel\n\nHe is run after by a mob of white people.\n\nAll in all, the message seems to be that Black culture has been Kenneled by American whites. They ignore what is happening in their own backyard because it's all contained away from them, Kenneled, if you will. They chose to focus on the the superficial aspects while completely ignoring everything wrong. This is leading to the destruction of traditional wholesome values, which are being replaced by cult like selfishness, leaving the youth with nothing of substance for the future.\n\nAs for the entire Satire / Played straight aspect - Satire is a social message. It's Satire played Straight to illustrate a point.\n\nPS: I would also like to give props to DG's Dance moves, which I like to call \"The Nerdy Michael Jackson\" which is in full force here.",

From what I can tell, the film is starkly existentialist and deals primarily with the problem of God, death, and doubt. \n\nHowever, I can’t seem to wrap my head around what Bergman is trying to say with this film. Obviously, the film is pretty atheistic and draws from Kierkagard (and perhaps Nietschze). But it seems to me that there is something more to it than simply nihilistic despair. \n\nWhat do you all think? Does Bergman dispense with the idea of God entirely by the end of the film (“It is finished”)? What is he trying to say about morality (the witch scene)? \n\nThanks everyone for reading!",

        "text": "Hey y'all,\n\nSo recently I don't know why, I just gotten so numb with movies that they don't bring that same magic to me anymore. I remember I use to watch a film a night when I was 17. Now at 22, I try to watch a movie but I come out disappointed or just \"meh\". But then I got this movie out of a recommendation of a friend and from my older brother. Plus after seeing my uncle Toro get an Oscar for The Shape of Water (a movie I like a lot) I decided \"hey I should check out Pan's Labyrinth, it's arguably his best work\". What took me so long to watch it was mainly due to school and work so it wasn't until roughly a month later after buying the film I finally sat down and watched it.\n\nWow, just wow!! It was a fantasy story I wanted to see! Before I wasn't a fantasy guy, but after watching this and reading Neil Gaiman's American Gods, I can say my opinion has changed. But I digress. Pan's Labyrinth just felt so unique to me, I felt like it spoke to my differently than most other films, I loved it that they were not afraid to use practical effects and the CGI was used sparingly. I also loved how the main girl used fantasy to try to escape from her dark world but her fantasy world is just as dark. I also thought the violence was used to forward the story rather than just have violence for the sake of violence. I just love the story how it felt so real, I knew it was a fantasy but it felt like I was really part of the story. Plus the ending I felt like was well deserved. I'm someone that usually doesn't mind a happy ending but it has to be earned y'know?\n\nI've been giving the film some thought and quite honestly, it made me want to go back into writing and film-making. Before I thought I was done with film because \"it's impossible, there's too many people and voices, I'm not going to get a shot.\" Now after watching this, I just felt something deep inside me say \"you can make art like this, you HAVE to go back into film\".\n\nThat's just my views on the film, what did y'all think of Pan's Labyrinth??",

They were being deliberately provocative but what I think they were trying to say was that everyone focuses on how immigrants have brought themselves up but seem to neglect marginalised groups \\(such as black people\\) who were already here.\n\nIn this regard, are there any films that you can suggest where black Americans are dealing with immigration and concerns about losing their communities through immigration? For instance, I see a lot of news about Dreamers going to college and achieving their goals \\(often with particular scholarships\\). However, I wonder how black Americans must feel seeing others getting opportunities that you could argue they  themselves have never really had to begin with?\n\nSo are there any films that represent this within America about immigration  and black concerns about this?",

But, I thought of something that made me like it. James Stewart's character, after Madeline dies, and he feels guilty, so guilty that he sees the doctor and looks real sick. He can't get over her death, and he sees Madeline everywhere he goes, so he imagines that he meets a woman named Judy who looks exactly like his lost love Madeline; he wants her back so bad that he imagines he can turn someone else into her, and then imagines maybe it is her, and that she didn't really die because he can't handle that, he imagines that it wasn't her that feel out the window but that Mr. Elster had an elaborate plot to kill his wife. And when Judy falls at the end, it is symbolic of his imagination failing, and that he can never really bring Madeline back, because that's what happens when people we love die.",

As you may see in the title,I watched a 2010 japanese movie called Confessions and,thus I was expecting just a nice and good plot about revenge,it was able to leave me a scar of emotion that made me love it and probably will make me carry it with me forever.\n I know it may sound a bit exaggerated but this film caused me emotion in a way that no other ever did...the fact that every chapter is somebody's confessions add deepness to the characters,and the deepness turns them and the shock and violence that sorrownds'em into more than just scenes...it turns it into images which make you experience emotions in a way that,for me,is very unique.\n The characters(as I said),are deep,cause the revenge is the main plot butnot the only one,you learn more about them through the film and,as a consequence,learn also about their pain and the reality they lived at that lead them to the situation which is the plot base...it makes it much more emotional to see them interact and suffer.\n The technical aspects are also something that I have true love for. The photography is absolutely beautiful,with a lot of cold collors that creates an atmosphere of sadness and pessimism but also of charm,calm and beauty;something I fell in love with right away. The soundtrack is also very special,I like every single song there and everytime I listen to them I remember of sadness pain and beauty...cause these are the feelings this powerful movie left with me.\n Althought it is not a common choice,I gotta say that Confessions is my favorite movie of all time. Is a revenge movie but also a movie that fill me with pain,sadness,contemplation,beauty,shock,heartwarm,heartbreak and ultimately...love. Eternal love.\n Have anybody here watched it? Share your thoughts with me.\n",

        "text": "I should probably start by giving my personal definition of an epic film because it's a *genre* that can be described many different ways.\n\n*A film that lasts more than three hours and captures a wide landscape.*\n\nNow it's a very stripped-down definition of a *genre* that's responsible for some of the most important films in cinematic history, but I feel it's only way I can truly express my love for the *genre* as a whole, without going in-depth about my favorite films from it.\n\nMy first interaction with the *epic* was *Lawrence of Arabia*. I remember hearing how amazing it was and so on...plus I had just watched *Bridge on the River Kwai* and was on my way down the David Lean rabbit hole. I remember being shocked at the runtime of the film: about three and half hours. HOLY SHIT. I mean *Bridge on the River Kwai* was long too but no this long. How the hell is a film supposed to hold my attention for almost four hours? And VOILA, it was the most beautiful film I had ever seen and introduced to one of my favorite actors, Peter O'Toole. \n\nNow after watching *Lawrence of Arabia*, I fell in love with *epics*. I went from *Ben-Hur* to *Spartacus* to *Doctor Zhivago* and on and on.\n\nA real shock came to me when I first watched *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*. I knew the film was comedy gold, filled with amazing actors and crazy cameos from legends, but was this an epic? I mean it met my *guidelines* of runtime and landscape, but something about the film didn't seem right. Maybe because I was infatuated with religious or historical epics, but I soon realized that an epic doesn't have involve a camel ride through a sandstorm or a 7-minute chariot race to become an *epic*, but what it needs is a rich and catchy story and a good eye for the world. Doesn't matter if the film involves the history of America or it just revolves around chasing down the BIG W, as long it's entertaining and long, it's an *epic*.\n\nNow I know, many people have a better understanding of the epic film genre that me, I'm just one who enjoys the variation the genre has to offer. I also should have mentioned the Japanese *epics* like *Seven Samurai* or *Ran*, but my dissertation is far away in the future.\n\nWhat's your favorite *epic* film?",

I loved it for the most part, especially the moral complexity of the central characters, but the final few scenes seemed to flip flop on Exley’s motivations. At the end of the motel shootout, Exley shoots Dudley in the back; presenting a delightfully grey mix of his desire for justice, his desire to bring it about honorably, and his realization that these desires may not be able to coexist. It brings up great questions about what justice truly is, how it can or can’t be achieved, etc, etc. \n\nThen he gives a deadpan retelling of the truth in the interrogation room before letting the higher ups outside know that he is more than willing to hide that truth in order to become “a hero.” He then goes and lies about everything to the public so he and Dudley can be praised as heroes. His political motivations throughout the film, often at odds with his rigorous views of justice, are satisfied. \n\nThis makes no sense to me. The arc of his character seemed complete at the end of the motel shootout. He was ready to destroy his reputation “with a wrecking ball” to ensure that justice was served. Then he suddenly decides that his career is more important than justice somewhere between the shootout and the interrogation and somehow forgets about all that wrecking ball stuff. On top of that, after Exley receives his medal, the movie sends us off with a bro handshake and nothing but smiles between White and Exley, presenting the turn of events as if they’re supposed to be happy. \n\nWhen/how did this flip flop in Exley’s character happen? It seems jarringly out of sync with the progression of the film up to this point to me. Any thoughts?",

I have also found Hollywood: Rituals of Smoking by Donald Sutton which discusses how cigarettes help to reveal themes of buisness romance and politics in several Howard Hawks films.

        "text": "There was a post about 8 hours old, titled \"Truefilm \"Toxicity\" and Gatekeeping: A Pointed Rebuttal\" in response to the accusation on the sub's toxicity from another redditor, that has been erased by mods. While I understand the decision deleting it (it was a personal attack, which is something that should be avoided by all means imho) nevertheless it had good points that were worth considering.\n\n\nThere's been quite some controversy in the last year as to the direction r/TrueFilm is taking. And not without reason. I’m among those who think it changed noticeably and for the worst. And is exponential I’m afraid. My pet theory is mods think that since the number of subscriptions is raising that must mean they are keeping the old editors and on top of that adding new ones. I don't think is the case, I think is more likely the readers of this sub are simply changing, or rather being swapped.\n\n\nToday is hard to find good quality posts about film, which is what some of us got subscribed to r/TrueFilm up in the first place and is what the sub is supposed to be about. The quality of the contents dropped significantly over the past year, drastically in the past months. I'm considering seriously unsubscribing but am only here for some interesting posts that pop up now and them.\n\n\nThe usual complaint people like me and the author of the second post (the rebuttal one) have is this: there's no more in-depth discussion in this sub devoted to in-depth discussion. Is that simple. And what is worse is the reaction of some redditors that pretend that such position in arrogant and pedant without addressing the real problem here: the drop of quality in the content. Dismissing a vantage point without giving actual reasons as to why it is not a valid one, isn’t it pretentious? \n\n\nRedditors like the author of the first post (the toxicity one) argue that is somehow pedant and highbrowish to dismiss superhero flicks just because they are mainstream or just because they are Hollywood. But that’s not the point. At least that’s not my point. I have a concern about this sub and the gist of it but it has nothing to do with the fact that some people want to discuss Marvel movies. *The problem is not what kind of movies are being discussed, the problem is the discussions themselves* that had changed from being nice and interesting for the most part to be fanboyish and superficial for the most part.\n\n\nLately the sub is filled with posts about superhero, Star Wars, Hollywood flicks that are no different from those you can find in r/movies or r/Flicks. And while I of course respect those subs and what they do I do not have the least interest in them, the films they talk about and more importantly *the way they do it*. Today is difficult to make the difference between the three subs, and is kind of sad because it speaks about the monotony of film criticism in reddit. Again: is not merely about the subject at hand but more importantly about how said subject is approached. Is not like some of us despise superhero movies, what we don't like (or at least I don’t) is the trite insubstantial discussion they generate here and elsewhere. I'm getting tired of posts with the last theory about what *Anihilation* was really about or why the last Marvel creation is so great, not because they talk about *Ahinhilation* or because they talk about a Marvel movie, I'm not interested in them because they are completely shallow and more often that not only seek echo chambering, is good material for r/movietheories or r/Marvel but for r/trueFilm? I'm not sure. Actually I’m not sure anymore. Maybe is the kind of content the majority of subscriptors of r/TrueFilm today want to see at the top of the frontpage...\n\n\n\nAs far as I know mods did nothing to change the trend in the last months. That can mean two things (well maybe more but I lack imagination for it…) that they don't see a problem with it or that they don't want or can address it. If is the case they don't see a problem with the problem (is a problem, source: recent meta posts like this one) fine. If they see a problem, well, I think is time for a change guys, the \"let things take its course\" approach didn’t work imho",

He is obsessive, has violent tendencies, and sees himself as a \"saviour\" not only to the city, but to the women in his life. He's racist, hateful, and alone.\n\nObviously this film resonates with anyone who has felt that overbearing loneliness before in their lives, but in my most recent viewing it just amazed me how all these attributes of Travis Bickle have nearly directly translated into the zeitgeist of the Alt-Right movement. The hatred, racism, and contempt for women are all traits that encompass the movement, and in a modern day America, I feel Taxi Driver is just as important as ever in a cultural sense. 70's aesthetic aside, this is a film that would translate very well into today's political landscape.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8h079p/tsai_mingliang_and_his_furtively_unconventional/",
        "text": "After having seen and been thoroughly enthralled with several Tsai films over the past few months, I began to wonder to myself why his particular approach to meditative cinema was so much more captivating to me than many others who have tried to do the same thing. It wasn't until I saw THE RIVER a few nights ago that I finally realized \\(or at least, began to formulate possible reasons\\) why he's able to maintain a very consistent allure that's almost so subtle that frankly it often runs the risk of going completely unnoticed.\n\nTo read the my full comments, I've made a Letterboxd post which details some of these things in more depth, with supporting screen captures from THE RIVER, outlining both the film itself as well as Tsai's temperament as a whole. Everything in this post will remain more general, and will be more focus on his entire body of work rather than just THE RIVER.\n\n[https://letterboxd.com/tectactoe/film/the\\-river\\-1997/](https://letterboxd.com/tectactoe/film/the-river-1997/)\n\nIn short, Tsai constantly \\(but subtly\\) bends us towards the edge of unease by employing a more unorthodox manner w.r.t. his framing. We're almost always viewing things against a seemingly undefined angle from both the vertical and horizontal axes. Over the course of an entire film, this simple technique ends up subverting our ingrained assumption that the \"center\" of the frame is always the most important part. In a Tsai film, nearly every part of the frame is equally important; he uses his stilted camera with maximum efficiency, often utilizing every inch of the frame within a single sequence.\n\nFurthermore, there's always a certain amount of forced perspective that accompanies this angular method, and he uses this to maximum effect, denoting which items/people are identifiable as Oppressor/Oppressed. There are several such shots in THE RIVER : one in particular when a man's room begins to flood from the ceiling. The shot not from the perspective of the man himself, but with the camera at the man's knees, accenting the angle at which the camera must look up towards the destroyed ceiling, giving an additive impression of defeat at the hands of nature.\n\nWhich kind of flows into another recurrence I find so absorbing: the way he emphasizes the environment as direct personifications of existence. \"Rain\" \\(or, more generally, \\*water\\*\\) is probably his most\\-used motif \\-\\- in REBELS it represented harmfully compounding ennui; in GOODBYE, DRAGON INN it represented the disconnect between humans and things they once loved; in STRAY DOGS and THE RIVER it represented the forceful power of desperation and isolation from the world; and perhaps most brilliantly in 4THE WAYWARD CLOUD it represented love and, the film was actually centered around the \\*lack\\* of water \\(viz. the \"lack\" of love\\) which was substitute by watermelon, which, by no coincidence, is drawn as a strict parallel to sex \\-\\- but he also highlights a direct foreplay between his subjects and their milieu, one often responding directly to the other, and typically working in a cyclic/feedback\\-style loop.\n\nI also find a striking amount of confidence in his films. Some may incorrectly write this off as wankery or pretension, but the way he foregrounds and prioritizes \\*images\\* to tell his stories \\-\\- versus long bouts of strenuous discourse or monologue \\-\\- feels not only natural and engrossing, but \\*ubiquitous\\*. Imagery \\-\\- unlike e.g. Mandarin, or English, or whatever other dialect \\-\\- is a far more universal \"language.\" Most Tsai films you could completely strip of their already limited dialogue and the general mantra, mood, and overall sentiment of the film wouldn't change or be compromised one bit. This, in particular, is fascinating to me, and the confidence he maintains with his own poetic lyricism is far more fascinating than pompous or big\\-headed.\n\nHis metaphorical registers form an equalized helix with the superficial model: e.g. STRAY DOGS can be interpreted in several ways, and even incorporates some modestly \"surreal\" elements \\(referring mostly to the Tri\\-actress woman and what she represents\\) but the surface\\-level desperation is equally as palpable, and the haunting implications of a man bathing his kids in a public restroom and ravaging a cabbage head in the middle of the night sting like vinegar even without the need for underlying subtext. This gives his films a multi\\-layered veneer, allowing them to be enjoyed purely cosmetically, but also giving them sufficient depth for those who wish to explore and dig deeper into the themes. But like a master, his symbolism \\-\\- even in spite of the ostensible bluntness at times \\(like Watermelon in THE WAYWARD CLOUD\\) \\-\\- never combats negatively with the narrative in a way that feels desperate.\n\nThere are still a few Tsai films I've yet to see \\(currently working on \\*finding\\* them, which is proving to be difficult\\), but I can't remember the last time I found someone's entire body of work so insanely irresistible, and I wanted to share and lament my love for who is undeniable one of the greatest filmmakers currently living/working, and could easily become one of the all\\-time greats as time marches on and his films have a few decades with which to macerate in people's minds.\n\nI know this is mostly just pure blabbering, but **I'd like to end by opening up discussion about Tsai Ming\\-ling, both for fans and dissenters. What have your experiences been like with his films? Which ones do/don't you like, and why or why not?**",

When asked why it is such a respected film, the answer is usually because it pioneered film technique in cinematography and storytelling. \n\nOf course that is all true but I actually think it has become underrated as pure entertainment. I personally feel that it is a really fun movie with great performances and a very profound meaning. I also think that if it was released in 2018 it would still be considered a masterpiece. Charles Foster Kane is a truly fascinating and complex character that people have been debating and discussing for 75 years. For a character or movie to be that powerful there is definitely more going on then influential filmmaking. What do you think? ",

        "text": "When we talk about generic villains and their plans, especially in a superhero/blockbuster context, we're often talking about antagonists with a very superficial motivation for doing the Bad Stuff (tm) that they do. Usually it will be some under-explored desire for **\"ultimate power\"** or **\"total destruction\"**, **\"revenge\"** or sometimes just plain old **\"wealth\"**.\n\nThese are not necessarily weak motivations, if you understand intimately why the villain is willing to dedicate, and perhaps sacrifice, their lives to achieve their goal. But more often than not we don't.\n\nI recently watched **Infinity War** [MINOR SPOILERS] which I feel tries to make Thanos more interesting and nuanced by making his grand plan more than simply wanton destruction or some grand power grab for the sake of it. His motivations and master plan of destroying half the life in the universe to achieve some kind of perfect cosmic balance echoed the Totalitarian Taoist philosophy of Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins. \n\nThough for me, they ultimately fail in making him as interesting as Al Ghul because the premise of Thanos plan doesn't make any sense in the context of a world in which he owns a magic weapon that can literally shape reality. I.e. he could just make more resources for people, or make wastelands arable on worlds where people were starving etc. But at least there's an attempt at giving him a more complicated, or human, motivation than most superhero villains.\n\nOutside of Ra's Al Ghul, when I think of the Villains With Master Plans whose schemes or motivations actually engaged me, I think of:\n\nOzymandias (Watchmen)\nMr. Glass (Unbreakable)\nSyndrome (Incredibles)\nErik Kilmonger (Black Panther)\n\n*Mind you, even though these are all super villains in superhero movies, that's incidental. You just happen to find more Grand Schemes in this genre than anywhere else.*\n\nCommon for all of them, to me, is that I'm conflicted by them. To a point, I understand why they're doing what they're doing.\n\nWhat other Grand Cinematic Villains (villains who have a master plan) have motivations and schemes that go beyond the basic familiar tropes, that actually manage to be interesting or understandable?\n\n\n--- Even though I think **The Joker** in The Dark Knight is one of the all-time great villains, part of what makes him memorable is the script's subversion of character motivation for him. It's not that he's one-note, it's that the movie deliberately makes a point out of the 'unknowability' of his motivation. You could argue that his motivation is to create chaos, though we don't know precisely why. He is ultimately, as per Alfred, \"a man we don't fully understand\". Still, for the purposes of this discussion he's hard to categorize.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8gng92/a_second_viewing_of_you_were_never_really_there/",
        "text": "I know there were already a few decent threads about Lynne Ramsay's film You Were Never Really Here, but I wanted to contribute to the conversation myself, after my experiences today watching the film in the theater a second time.\n\nLast night, a thread started over at /r/movies, with a very funny David Lynch interview. [It's still running strong if you want to take a look.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luB1IGrS89g&amp;t=0s) I think the quote in question is quite funny - \n\n&gt;Lynch: \"Eraserhead is my most spiritual film.\" \n\n&gt;Q: \"Elaborate on that.\" \n\n&gt;Lynch: \"No.\"\n\nThe end of the interview, however, hit me much harder than that funny exchange, which is where Lynch elaborates on this idea, using the language of film theorists and art theorists, who have been exploring this idea going back probably a hundred years:\n\n[I've transcribed as accurately as I could:]\n\n&gt;Q: I could ask you what the film is about, but you don't really like to tell people what your films are about. I can ask you... ask you instead what other theories you have heard, what have other people have reported to you... \n\n&gt;Lynch: Oh, many many many things.\n\n&gt;Q: Let's hear a few of them.\n\n&gt;Lynch: No no no. Um.. you know... I always say... that, um, it's, see, it's, **the film is the thing. The film is the thing. You work so hard to get, you know, after the idea, to get this thing built, all the elements to feel correct, the whole to feel correct, in this beautiful language called cinema. And, the second it's finished, people want you to change it back into words. and it's very, very, um, saddening, it's, um, torture, it's the film, the language is cinema.** \n\n&gt;When things are concrete, very few variations in interpretation. But the more abstract a thing gets, the more varied the interpretations. **But people still know inside what it is for them.** And, um, and even if they don't trust their intuition, I always say that... if some girl named Sally, she comes out of the theater, I don't have a clue what that means, she goes over with Bob and Jim to get a cup of coffee, Bob starts talking about what he thinks it is, because he knows exactly what it is, he starts talking, five seconds later, Sally is saying “No, no, no, no, it's not that!” And all these things come out of Sally, so Sally really did know, for herself. That's the beauty of it. It's just like life, you see the same, sort of the same things, but you come up with many many different things as you go along as a detective... \n\nSo, I watched the thing a few times. I liked it so much that I transcribed it, obviously, but by deciding to post here I'm aware I've opened myself up to a much more experienced crowd. I've never taken a film theory class, or done much reading on film theory. I know much more about music theory and literary theory and studied a bit of postmodern drama and music in college, but as I've gotten older, I find myself leaning into cinema with my spare time and attention, rather than experimental music or literature. I resisted this for some time, because I think I bought into the idea that cinema was some kind of 'lesser' art than literature or music. I can see now that this idea is completely bunk. \n\nWhat Lynch is implying here, to me, is that cinema communicates with its viewers in its own language, just like a novel, a poem, a piece of music, or a painting. Which is obvious; but more so, what resonates with me more profoundly, is that this communication is really non-verbal. With paintings, the communication is obviously non-verbal. As a musician myself, I write music that plays with lyrics, and music without lyrics, but always felt aware that the best music was also communicating nonverbally. Literary analysis was infuriating to me, because as a on-again-off-again creative writer, I felt like writing a story was actually a sort of non-verbal channeling, and that the best pieces of literature transcended their words and became pure feeling, and yet, literary analysis is just an endless fire-hose of words. Long-form essays endlessly dissecting the intention and context of some novel whose author is long dead, whole classrooms participating in this amateur analysis year after year, categorizing the motivations and intentions of the same pieces by the same authors, and on and on.\n\nPerhaps because I don't know anything about creating cinema, I've been able to maintain this appreciative dissasocaition with movies thus far. For the past several years, I realize I've been chasing this kind of feeling - and by attempting to describe it, right here, I am actually worried that I'm breaking part of that magic sensation that Lynch described above: I sit in the movie theater, as the credits roll, and my mind plays and replays scenes from the movie. Like a dream, I start to think about my life, scenes from my life. Gradually, I return to myself, to my seat, to the people in the theater with me. I wonder if they were affected by the film as well, what they are thinking about. Slowly, I get up, and I walk outside. The sensation peaks when I walk out, and like coming up from underwater, stand next to the street, under the marquee. The sounds of the city wash around me, the people talking, laughing, gossiping, making plans, going one way or another. And I just want to stand there for a few minutes, looking. The best is when it's late at night, and the street is mostly empty, and I can step a few feet into the street and look down at the streetlights, the rows, the empty storefronts and the night sky. And maybe a scene from the movie will play out in my mind, or perhaps a feeling from the movie will visit me.\n\nIn writing this, I felt tempted to say something like \"And the street looks just like a movie, and I feel like I'm in a movie!\" That isn't really it. That's just my mind attempting to put words to some experience and turn it into a cool idea, as opposed allowing it to remain a drifting effervescence. I know I'm not alone in this experience; in fact, I know probably everyone reading this has had some kind of experience like this. And you might describe it using different words, and put some other kind of meaning to it, and you would be right. So there's nothing special about this; other than that it proves that cinema is truly art.\n\nAnyways, I saw 'You Were Never Really Here' last week. I loved it, but I didn't know why. I wrote in another thread that it felt strange: I wrote that it reminded me of a hipper version of 'Man on Fire.' I wrote that I couldn't tell if it was an art flick trying to be a thriller, or a thriller trying to be an art flick, or a success at both, or some kind of hybrid. Lots of words, and analysis. But I was struck over the weekend with the realization that I've just been thinking about the movie, regularly, multiple times a day, and the thoughts have no words, they're just feelings, memories, images, sensations. And then that reddit post came up yesterday, and I listened to Lynch's words, and I just became overwhelmed with a desire to see the movie again.\n\nI walked from my classroom to the downtown cinema, on a weekday at 1:00. The film was still playing on the smallest screen, only two other viewers came to watch it. I was utterly transfixed. I allowed myself to just watch, watch, watch, without analyzing anything with words. I saw all kinds of tiny details the second viewing, little details around the edges of frames, that Ramsay put into her piece of art, that I missed the first time around. \n\nIn Joe's flashbacks, his father wears a towel on his head and carries a hammer. When Joe can't decide whether to do one more job or kill himself, he's stopped by a woman at a train station's glare who has a black eye; perhaps suffering from domestic violence herself? Under her gaze, he can't jump. Instead, he goes to the spa. He buys the hammer. When he slowly draws the towel from his head, he becomes his father. His father who has the hammer, with the white towel over his face. He embodies his father. When he kills, he is the spiritual embodiment of his father. He expects to die during every job, and indeed, attempts to kill himself at the beginning of the movie after saving the unseen first child in the opening scene. Failing again, the movie continues. The end of the movie, with its fake suicide scene, is just one of many failed suicides. Except in this one, he's woken from his stupor by someone else.\n\nHe's able to surprise the killers in his own house because he knows how to step quietly on the staircase, just like he did when he was hiding from his father. \n\nHe rolls down the window on his way to the lake, allowing his hand to ride in the breeze, and we hear - before we see - a rustling, and the camera turns, and its the breeze from the open window rattling the plastic covering his mother's body in the backseat. I didn't quite experience that scene the first time around; this second viewing, it crushed me. \n\nOther moments: like the governer blowing on something just out of frame, or rocking a little chair. Or when Joe is contemplating jumping in front of the train and the woman notices him: I saw this the first viewing, and mentioned it above, but this second viewing, I noticed how when the strange woman with the bruise is introduced, she appears to be making eye contact at something just off center, just off to the right of the lens, and slowly the frame is pulled back, and we can see Joe leaning. That tension of her gaze, not knowing where it leads, it held for just a few seconds.\n\nOther moments: when Joe's 'manger' is waxing poetic about his boat and steaks, and asks Joe how he feels about it, Joaquin's character just barely breaths out a 'what?' confused, totally uncaring and distracted from his manager's fantasy. On my second viewing, I had a sensation of realizing that Joe was being distracted out of his own, private fantasy, and I wondered what that might be.\n\nThe sound design hammering Joe as he moves through the city, overwhelming him, to the point to where the audience can barely hear the group of teenage girls ask him to take his photograph. We have to hear again, just like Joe, to their request, because our attention is elsewhere. We weren't paying attention.\n\nAnother poster noticed this, referred to it in their essay, and I noticed it the second viewing: when Joe goes to drown with the body of his mother, the soundtrack, framing, lighting all combine to outline the path to the lake as this beautiful walk into the sunset: a relaxing, warm bath. When Joe walks back to his car, the soundtrack is gone, and his footsteps squish awkwardly in the silence.\n\nFinally, the countdowns, which tie Joe to the young Nina throughout the film. The countdowns introduce us to both characters before they ever meet, and tie their spirits together in the mind of the viewer. Their countdowns overlap, but aren't in sync. One ends before the other. One finds their catharsis, one finds meaninglessness, one reaches the end of their journey, another reaches their beginning.\n\nAt this point, my words are failing to accurately describe the sensation I felt on my second viewing of the ending scene of this movie. \n\nWhile I feel like the 'dream' suicide in the diner was a bit of a misstep that took me out of the mood, I did feel much more positively about the ending in general on this second viewing. There was this sense that these two characters were spiritually interlinked. The countdowns contributed enormously to this sense, in addition to all the plot devices, acting choices, editing choices - especially the PTSD flashbacks. Nina's theft of Joe's revenge, by killing the governor, suddenly began to inform and make sense of Joe's breakdown in the governer's bedroom, on this second viewing. He's been looking forward to the one 'job' that ends with his death since he started this business. He channels his father to kill for justice and money. Like his father, he wishes to die, be killed, commit suicide. After breaking down, he stumbles through the house to a cacophonous soundtrack, seeing images of himself as a child, and his mother ... from the perspective of the spirit of his abusive father, whom he's still channeling? Is he crying because he made himself into a monster over nothing? Is he still his father? Or simply because he realizes that he's too tangled to untangle? Perhaps he never killed for good, he was just an evil man the entire time? Again, too many words here. The more I write, the more I move away from that feeling, that experience as he rips his shirt off and stumbles through that nightmare of a mansion.\n\n\nThe two men, lying on the kitchen floor, respecting each other, holding hands, singing together.\n\nJoe's angst and childish recreation of his own personal 'Psycho,' caretaking for his mother, intermixed with his dutifully cleaning up after her in the bathroom. \n\nHis unbearable suicidality when asked by her about his ex from 20 years past - or was it 10 years? Or 30? Has his mother lost track of time? Does she remember what year it is, and does she know how she hurts him?\n\nThe language of cinema, as wielded by Lynne Ramsay and her particular toolkit, made all these moments. These moments evoked, for me, particular feelings without words. Spirit sensations. Each director has their own, and some create more effective moments than others. If the film is good, I carry these moments into the night, and then suddenly the film is more than just 'The broken hitman who goes to save the girl.' It seems to access a sort of mysticism. Which is crazy, I mean, the film is about a dude who stalks pedophiles with a fucking ball-peen hammer. But that's cinema, I guess.\n\nI hope this perspective sticks with me, and that I can keep my senses, my mind, and my consciousness a bit more open every time I step into the theater. A good film finds its way in, if I'm open to it. I guess I'm just trying to put words to this sense that I've always felt when I've watched a good movie. And maybe, in so doing, I'm ruining it a bit for myself. I sure hope not! I love this forum, and I appreciate many of the thoughtful posts that I see here. After all, it's a forum board: all we have are words.\n\n",

        "text": "Infinity War, for all its ambitions of being a grand Hollywood epic, feels slight because they never let the shots breathe. Consider the scene where Thanos' minion fight Iron Man. How many times do both camps end up crashing into places? Yet they have less impact than a punch in a Jackie Chan. Everything just happens so rapidly. You are never given the window to feel them being slammed on objects. Looking At the whole movie, I don't think there was a single memorable shot. A single striking composition. Which for a movie of this scale is quite breathtaking. \n\nLet's move back to their previous film, Civil War. It sometimes dawns on me that film rampages through Lagos, Berlin, Siberia,  Vienna and Queens. Yet they all look the same. They all have the same overcast skies. And the same, non descript modern buildings. My friend calls it the concrete sludge aesthetic. This is present in most MCU movies. But most apparent in Russo films. It probably is the biggest reason i cant get through the famed Airport fight scene. It's just depressing to look at. And we are just talking about general aesthetic. The film also has a number of confusing action scenes at the first stretches of the film where the 180 degree rule is broken quite liberally.  I don't understand why the action took such a dip from Winter Soldier. \n\nSpeaking of which, even their best film is marred by the same lack of cinematic variety. But it sort of fits here. The tone and content of the film is well suited to the concrete sludge, gray aesthetic. What's less forgivable, and this rings true for both of their proceeding films, is the coverage of dialogue. In what can be described as utterly clinical and impersonal.  They have no interest in covering dialogue in a way that may illuminate anything deeper the character may be going through. Everything must be shot in the most clinical terms with the same repetitive set ups. Shot, reverse shot close ups, and the occasional medium shot. Maybe a two shot once. \n\nI can't help but think how much more of a spectacle Infinity War could be under the helm of someone who is a bit more cinematically proficient. Hell, even Joss Whedon, who is no great genius when it comes to the camera mind, would've cooked up something better and more appealing. ",

        "author": "margaerytyrellscleav",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8gkfsy/a_quiet_place_what_is_the_contemporary_taste_of_a/",
        "text": "I know bringing very, very mainstream affair into this subreddit has started to become something of a contentious issue of late, but if you wouldn't mind sticking through this until the end I'm hoping the mentioning of *A Quiet Place* will serve as a jumping off point to talk about the standing of contemporary mainstream film criticism in general.\n\n  To put it bluntly, I didn't like this film at all. That's fine and I was quite happy to move on and not give that fact a second thought, until I out of morbid curiosity looked at the critical reception for this film and my jaw dropped. I knew this film had been received positively, I had assumed as a straightforward thriller executed with a minimal amount of pretentiousness or delusions about what it was. I was wrong, this film is being absolutely fawned over by mainstream outlets as though it were virtually one of the thrillers of the decade thus far. I'm at a loss as to why, and thought this might be a worthwhile opportunity to think about mainstream criticism, rather than the film itself.\n\nI'll start by taking some quotes from the film's Metascore page on IMDB:\n\n&gt; A terrifying thriller with a surprisingly warm heart. - The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nI'm slightly confused about what is surprisingly warm about the film. It's message seems to be 'don't hate your children, isn't family nice?'. I'd say that's more bile-inducingly clichéd than warm. \n\n&gt; A Quiet Place is a tautly original genre-bending exercise. - Variety\n\nIt might be one of the most derivative films you'll ever see. From its premise, to its score, to its family-centric message, to the monsters. To see this film be praised for originality seriously makes me wonder if I'm on crazy pills.\n\nTo arrive at a more serious point, however, I thought it was interesting to note that when the credits rolled Michael Bay is credited as one of the producers. In score, editing, and story, I think this film is very *Bayish*. Something a lot of people here might have noticed if you follow film criticism, is that in recent years Michael Bay has undergone something of a rehabilitation. He has started to be recognised as a genuine auteur, and *Bayhem* - the editing style which bears his name - isn't the critical turd in the punch bowl that it was 10 years ago.\n\nSomething else to consider is how the film employs what Mark Kermode calls 'quiet, quiet, BANG!' method' of accruing, then cashing in on tension. There's a bit of a split in how contemporary horror/thriller films use scares. On the one side you have cosmic and psychological horror, which work quite hard to establish a fear and then horror within their audience - think the Babadook, or Elle as horror and thriller examples of recent times. Then we have the quiet, quiet, BANG! films who deliver scares virtually only by remaining quiet for an inappropriate amount of time so the situation becomes tense, then cashing in on it with a BANG! It might make you jump, but the scare is gone as soon as the millisecond dopamine hit is gone. You'll jump for a moment, but then move on immediately, just like after stepping on a plug in the darkness will make you jump for a moment, but then you'll move on immediately.\n\nThe quiet, quiet, BANG! method has been favoured in a lot of more straightforward thriller/horror films for many years now, and what makes *A Quiet Place* particularly interesting is that this method is not only how scares are delivered, but it is what the entire conceit of the film revolves around. I think that critics like this film so utterly, and that this film has adopted this method so utterly might be quite significant. If I wanted to be especially pretentious, I might link this to a society where everyone has become addicted to disposable experiences and shallow dopamine hits, but I'll try not to. What at the very least I would suggest though, is that I am quite surprised at the degree current film critics are rallying behind disposable film experiences as a positive. A film being 'well-crafted' seems to simply mean it borrows elements from other films, distils them into 90 minutes with little in the way of obstructing the viewer, and can be forgotten the moment the credits role.\n\nThe fact that Michael Bay has undergone this rehabilitation, that a film can be so disposable but have that be championed as a quality, and more worryingly be praised as original when it is anything but (the damned score, it's hands down the worst I've heard in years), suggest this is a bit of an odd time for film criticism. Again, I'll ask people so tell me what you think - what do current film critics want from the films they review today?\n",

        "text": "The most notable film industries off the top of my head are the US, France, Japan, Poland, Iran, Australia, Germany, Italy and, collectively, Scandinavia.\n\nI think a country’s film industry says a lot about it. Some countries can’t afford to subside the arts or can’t sustain a film industry because their economy is too small or poor. Others can support a film industry but might not have such a great output. Others still might have a prolific output that reflects their society’s characteristics. Films by or about Australia’s indigenous people are interesting because of how their narrative traditions interact with the cinematic form. Scandinavian films are often profoundly bleak or showcase their very dry humour. French cinema is known for exploring sexual transgression, which is interesting considering France’s socially conservative pretensions. Iranian cinema flourished with political fervour after the 1979 revolution, and so on.\n\nWhen I was younger my answer to this would have been France, especially after I saw many films from the French New Wave. When I’d tell French people I thought their films were the best in the world, they’d invariably shrug and deny it.\n\nWhat do you folks think?",

        "text": "Anyone that knows me is aware of my devotion towards Shunji Iwai, the person behind the masterpiece *All About Lily Chou\\-Chou.*\n\nSince I wrote a medium\\-sized essay/article in my native tongue \\(Spanish, I can share it with anyone interested in it\\) I'd like to talk with you guys about this movie, specially after seeing it the r/truefilm canon!\n\nObviously, the film, released in 2001, has many characteristics to discuss: characters, plot, soundtrack, colour scheme... but, for me, all of the splendour this movie has resides in the way it conveys ethical statements via aesthetical design. I'll clarify: the two biggest aesthetic elements that make the movie a standout are the original soundtrack \\(made by Lily Chou\\-Chou, a fictional yet real pop singer inspired by Björk and *Chungking Express*' Faye Wong\\) and the web messages that Iwai represents by showing them in a full black screen \\(some directly extracted from a online forum dedicated to the light novel that the director released just before the film\\). The messages involve students talking about how only Lily has **the e**ther, a core concept of the movie. To them, it is the ether that keeps them alive and heals them after being emotionally wounded, concepts also present in Lily's dreamy lyrics.\n\nBoth elements, apart from being beautifully crafted and grandiloquent, succeed in materializing what Iwai wants us to elarn from the movie. Which is:\n\n1. Today's youth is irreversibly \"techno\\-fetishist\", and that **IS NOT** completely bad. Traditionally, the portrayal of cyber culture and social media in cinema has been extremely negative, showing how it \"dehuminizes\" and deteriorates relationships. But in\\* All About Lily Chou\\-Cho\\*u, Iwai decides to show us the glorious part of online forums and Internet. Alienated kids that, without the support that both the singer and her fanbase offers would have long commited suicide, grow strong by bonding online, even if the bonding is with their real life mortal enemies.\n2. The sole responsible for failed generations and troubled youth is the previous generation. Japan is very, very conservative about social and familiar structures. Since Ôshima, some filmmakes have been actively fighting against that toxic ideal built around the concept of nuclear family. In the world of *All About Lily Chou\\-Chou*, adults are almost non\\-existent, and the power dynamics inherited from greedy and conservative parents are carried out by their children: sexism and classism are heavily present in the work. It is no surprise that the two female characters are raped or forced into prostitution by a male student whose family is destroyed after the collapse of the economy. Instead of punishing the youngsters, Iwai makes it clear that we can't fully blame them for being a dysfunctional  generation: \"baby\\-boomers\" have been negligent teachers and irresponsible caretakers. Children abandoned by their tutors, with their only solace being idol worship and a mutual interaction that becomes an anarchic abuse of power.\n\nI have a lot more to say about this movie, which I recommend to EVERYONE, specially those interested in Internet culture, Asian cinema \\(Iwai is, after all, one of the creators of the Japanese New New Wave\\) and music and its connection to the soul and psyche. For anyone that enjoyed this movie, please watch Iwai's other titles too! I really like *Swallowtail Butterfly*\\*, Vam*pire and his rec*ent A Bride for Rip Van Wink\\*le.",
