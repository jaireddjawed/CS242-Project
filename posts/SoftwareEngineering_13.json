        "text": "\nThe one crucial ingredient underpinning our transition to a digital-first economy, more than any other, is software. That’s why software engineering has become one of the world’s most in-demand professions. In the UK alone, the median salary for the role has increased 13% year-over-year as businesses look to stay ahead of the competition and attract the very best IT talent. But the high salary often isn’t consistent with where software developers stand in the business; many organizations\n still view them as suppliers rather than as crucial players in their success. Based on the current speed of transformation, we know that demand for software engineering is only going to increase. So business and technology leaders need to urgently consider vital cultural changes to help better integrate software development teams within the wider organization. But what exactly should they be?\ncommunication, ways of working and integration between software developers and the wider business. It’s a dilemma that needs immediate attention if businesses are to remain at the competitive edge.\n\nDevelopers are too often left to deal with huge monolithic pieces of work, which require them to write code for months on end without it being road-tested. This inevitably leads to mistakes that are found only once the updates have already been released to market creating a ripple effect throughout the organization. It’s an all-too-common scenario that demonstrates business leaders’ clear lack of clarity and understanding about the colossal value adopting a DevOps culture can deliver for the wider business, including its customers.\n\nTake financial institutions looking to introduce a new offering, for example, such as a new mortgage product. Without a collective approach to development, getting the backend systems up and running for a product can take up to six months. But modularising the options and breaking down the functionality can shorten timelines to weeks.\n\nBusiness leaders must look to create unified, cohesive and cross-functional teams that work together on projects that are broken down into simplified and localized components that can be easily integrated together without a negative impact on each other. It might seem like a small strategic change in working practices, but its impact on the speed and efficacy of software development can be enormous.\nThe role of the software engineer has changed; it is no longer about writing code in isolation without much regard for or knowledge of how it benefits the business. Developers work better when they have clarity about the direct impact their work will have on achieving business goals and on the bottom line. It’s down to business leaders to communicate these challenges and goals (in other words, understand the “why”) to help software developers understand what they’re trying to achieve. But doing so in a way that moves towards a better working culture requires a new approach to building and managing software development teams.\n\nThe first step is casting aside the negative stereotypes many have of software engineers and celebrating the intellectual and cultural diversity within their teams. Diversity of personnel brings a diversity of personalities, which is crucial to creating more inclusive cultures that accept and welcome all characters with open arms. While this may seem obvious, what is often overlooked is the impact diversity can have on stimulating and increasing innovation.",

I've tried messing around with making games in unity on my own time, had some practice with cpp in highschool, and am learning 8086 assembly and C in my lectures now. \n\nWhile it's somewhat interesting learning the syntax for each language and learning dry theory upon theory. I'm struggling to see what I could do with it. I would love to try and apply what I learned in practice, but it's incredibly hard to know where to start with it and how to look for information on that.\n\nGuess I'm just impatient with all the theory and I really want to try to work on some sort of project and just make something. Cause it feels like the lectures are going through all the information really slow and I would love to learn more, but I have no clue what that would be and where to start with it.\n\n\nSo I guess I would like to ask for:\n\n   • What topics/concepts I could look into as a beginner that would help get me started \n   • Any online resources that aren't just explaining syntax of a language, but going into how to use it and what I could do with it\n   • How you got started with programing, like how did you learn to go from simply knowing the language to making something with it \n   • How to be able to learn on my own \n   • Or just any opinions to this in general\n\n(tldr I want to learn more things, but I don't know where or what to start with - need advice pls)",

If i don’t get that help i really don’t know to do.\n - How to find a job.\n - What should i be cearful while looking for a job \n - And so on…\n So I really need to see others people ideas and clear my mind.

(coffee costs ~$2-$3) whilst the salaries in IT are hitting 6 figures!\nThis sets you for a luxurious live while having all the services and comfort of a mid European capital.\nAnd Prague is fucking beautiful!!\nI personally live at Walter Residency (premium living), have a private medical care (www.canadian.cz) with one of the clinics conveniently just before my apartment) and since a dinner in the best restaurant is $35, I don’t need to cook.\n\nI’ve saw many websites such as glassdoor with some numbers I don’t think reflect the current situation.\nI work as a Senior Data Scientist at a large consultancy firm and have an equivalent to $80k.\nI’m currently open to new opportunities with a 6-figure salary or &gt;$400/MD and I’m getting those offers.\nAlso, the job listings I see online (such as NoFluffJobs) are often 6-figures. \nThe highest offer I’ve saw recently was $150k for a React Develop in Brno (second biggest city in Czechia which feels like a small town).\n\nPeace ✌️",

I've had an unusually career path\n\nEnvironmental Studies bachelors\n\nCivil Engineering masters\n\nMy masters program had a decent amount of coding, but the pace was extremely fast and I wrote a master's thesis ( I did it to myself, I finished in less than 1.5 years). The thing is that I am realizing I loved all the programming I was doing and now I very rarely get to work in that world and I miss it a lot. Also, with the slower (and it appears commonly lower) salary projections in my current field, software engineering (or analogous careers) look a lot better.\n\nI was wondering if anybody had a similar type of unusual background and wanted to see how difficult it was to switch careers. I am especially interested in anyone that came from the civil engineering world and switched to software engineering. \n\nI am thinking because of my education, I can possibly work on coding myself, maybe do a coding bootcamp and make the switch with that. Am I being naive? Is there something else I should do to ready myself for this career switch?",
