In the area I live in there are three well known malls. One of them has this well known store that is kinda overpriced and brands like that usually don’t have security alerts at their store but other stores do. Ever time I go that that one brand, I take a bunch of clothes, and go to the mall bathroom in the disabled stall and remove the security tags by putting a metal fork I brought from home under the tag and pry it out with scissors you can get at walmart. I will not be saying the brand but it’s pretty well known and everyone at school thinks i’m rich and I fit in with a group at school who is known for being able to afford this kind of clothing. I’m known as that one girl who is always wearing [BRAND NAME] clothes. I will not be referring to the name, but it’s pretty trendy for clothing you can get pretty much anywhere else for $5-10. I do not encourage this because you can easily get caught.",

        "text": "I had 'the' exam yesterday. I put a lot of effort into preparing for that, and I was doing well initially in the exam, but at the last 40 mins I was not able to solve the maths section. I was trying but was not able to solve the questions. Those were very easy questions and still I failed to solve them. I ended up attempting only 60 questions without any margin of error and a few of the qs that I have attempted were actually rough guesses so I am kind of sure that I ruined it as there was 1/3rd negative marking. At home when I was preparing for the exam I did not practice maths enough because I thought I was good at it, and only worked on the gk part. But in the exam I was not able to solve even very easy qs in maths, those qs which I would have easily solved within 30 mins at home with 100% accuracy. \nAnyways there's a close friend of mine, she just applied because I was filling up the form. She did not prepare for the exam. She was not even serious about the exam. The night before the exam she was watching a web series when I was studying. Still she managed to give a better qs attempt with 72 qs which gives her a fairly good margin. I was the one who taught her maths a few months ago, as she was not good at it and I wanted to help her. But she ended up using that knowledge in the exam and I missed out. I'm not jealous but I feel so guilty for ruining my exam. Even my parents had expectations from me and I just messed up everything. \nThe exam has an age limit and only 2 more attempts are left from my side, as I am 22 and can appear for that exam only 2 more times. The exam is considered easy and other people I know are able to clear it in just one attempt. Though most of them get rejected in further steps, and I was hoping to clear the first part of the exam and then to appear for the next steps. But I failed at the first part only. I am very guilty. I don't know how to move on. I hate myself and want to go back in time and make things right. And now I am able to solve all the maths questions that I remember from the exam in my mind, but at the time of the exam I was not able to do that. That information is killing me. I feel extreme guilt and hate for myself.",
