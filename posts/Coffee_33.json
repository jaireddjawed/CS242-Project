The grinder is spinning and creating fine powder at the top, but it isn’t making its way down the grinder and into the portafilter.\n\nI’ve taken everything apart and cleaned and put back but doesn’t seem to make any difference. \n\nIt’s as if it can’t make its way from the top chamber to the bottom. Any ideas about what I should look at?",

Do I get to a final number by turning clockwise until I can’t go further then “count” to my desire size?\nAdditionally what size should I cut for it?\n\nThe water temp and a 15:1 ratio I think I have solved.

Today the grinder stopped mid grind. No beeps, no warning. I took the burr set apart and cleaned everything out, reassembled, set the grinder to 11 and it still won't turn on. Is there a fuse or something that could have blown? Could I have burned the motor out? I was grinding light-ish coffee but nothing even close to a Nordic roast. Any suggestions?\n\nI've submitted a warranty claim, pretty bummed this happened on a $500 grinder. What's another good flat burr grinder in the relative ballpark with a better motor? Can't say I'm very impressed at this point.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Additionally, some people may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others and may need to limit their consumption. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or people with certain medical conditions, should be particularly cautious about their caffeine intake and should consult with a healthcare professional before consuming it.\n\nIt is worth noting that these guidelines are for caffeine from [speciality coffee](https://specialtybatch.com/) specifically.

Even though I drink it everyday, I never been into coffee but I want to get more serious about it. My goal is get a better coffee set up with a budget of around 120-150 and needed some guidance.\n\nI was looking at getting the aeropress brewer as I drink black coffee 2 to 3 times a day and need something convenient, easy to clean and that I can make pretty quickly. I read great reviews on it here so for but would love to get better suggestions if you have any. I also see it’s Around 40 bucks and in the budget I am in. \n\nI would love to get suggestions on grinders in my budget from Amazon as well as what I will need to do to measure the amount of coffee and how to Measure the about of grounded coffee to use for the aero press ? \n\nI would also Appreciate on any tips to use the aero press to make the best and most consistent coffee. \n\nAs a bonus if you have any coffee subscription you would suggest to start off that would be great . \n\nLooking forward to starting this journey!\n\n  Thanks in advance for any the help and suggestions !",

        "text": "This can include flavor, complexity of process, equipment, etc. I'll be interested to see which techniques cluster together the most.\n\nFor me:\n\n1. Phin filter - perfect taste, very simple to use, requires no babysitting. A lot of people don't realize you can use good Arabica beans with these instead of just the Robusta variety, and you don't need as much sugar either.\n2. Moka pot - great taste, fast, but requires that I monitor the stove closely (and listen for the bubbling to signal the end of brewing). Also the cleaning and prep is just a bit more than the Phin.\n3. Espresso machine - good and dependable, but espresso machines are expensive and take up room. Also less than ideal for 6-8 oz of hot coffee (I typically try to do a long pull to get more volume) before dilution over ice.\n4. Pour over - requires the most effort, the most equipment, and still doesn't as strong of a brew as I'd like\n5. French press - solid extraction but too muddy and requires too much babysitting\n6. Keurig - would rank as by far the worst\n\nNot ranked (haven't tried yet):\n\n- Aeropress - not a fan of drinking hot liquid out of a plastic container on a _daily_ basis (I'm imagining container degradation over time)\n- classic drip coffee machine - has drawbacks similar to the espresso machine and pour over in terms of cost, size, and one use filters, and it probably has a rather dull flavor too, so not a worthwhile investment for me",

        "text": "I used to wonder why my coffee was almost always sour. It seems other people have the same problem, so I just want to share my story, my frustration, and my happy discovery. \n\nI'm also curious how other people learned the difference between sour vs stale? And what words you do you use to describe those flavors?\n\nTL;DR- bought a good grinder, bought fresh roasted coffee. Learned that stale sour is different than under extracted sour. Also, old beans stale is different than old grounds stale.\n\n\nFor my home coffee, I used to grind finer and finer and brew hotter and hotter and still have problems with sourness... I was buying grocery store coffee, sometimes preground, and using a cheapo javapresse ceramic burr hand grinder. Also, I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, so it could take weeks or months to use up a bag.\n\nRecently, I learned that what I thought was sour coffee was stale coffee. Under extracted sourness is different. It has a mouth puckering sour feel, not just a sour taste. I'm even thinking that roasted too long ago vs. ground too long ago staleness have different stale flavors. \n\nMy timeline of realization went like this: Early December- gifted a bag of roasted in October Intelligentsia beans, put them in the freezer knowing I would get a good grinder soon. Mid December- bought some specialty coffee locally about 5 days after it was roasted. Had the coffee shop grind it for me. I started keeping a journal of tasting notes and brewing methods. \n\nThat local coffee tasted a bit harsh for a day or two, then leveled off and was good, then lost its aroma, but tasted okay. This over a week or two. Then I got my 1ZPresso grinder and thawed out the Intelligentsia beans. They were good but just a touch ashy on the finish, if steeped too long. I mostly brewed those for the next couple weeks. \n\nThen I busted the local coffee back out a couple days ago, so it was ground almost a month ago. No aroma to the grounds. Suuuuper sour coffee like I used to always make. Tastes like vegetables. Tastes I don't know, green?  Undrinkable. Tossed it all out. \n\nWent back to Intelligentsia, ashy/roasty flavour more evident. Tried a new aeropress recipe with much coarser grind. Totally different! Not as ashy, but.... sour. My mouth felt like I ate sour candy. So that's what sour means! \n\nThe beans that were roasted months ago tasted ashy-roasty-sour when fresh ground, the fresh roasted but ground weeks ago coffee tasted plant-sour, and the under extracted coffee tasted (and felt) sour candy sour. Only the last one had the notably different mouthfeel. \n\nMaybe time past roast has more of an effect on purely internal/ time based chemical changes, while time past grinding has more of an effect on just oxidation type changes due to the increased surface area? \n\nI'm starting to experiment and make bad coffee on purpose now. Too hot water, too cold, waaaaay too much coffee, or extreme grind sizes. I hope I learn more about defects this way, and I hope this story helps someone!",

So I decided to buy a caramel latte the next day to see if it was just the frappe. Loved it too. I haven’t really breached too deeply into coffee just yet. The craziest I’ve gotten is a vanilla latte. I’m scared I’m gonna scare my tastebuds too much if I try a cappuccino or macchiato or something. But just thought this was an interesting development.\nAnyone have any ideas as to why my palette has suddenly changed?",

I know the roast is good (had the blueberry notes I was chasing) based on grinding it with the KitchenAid before receiving the Ode.  So on receiving the Ode, I thought \"wow, perfect--this'll be even better!\"... But alas, not-so-much.  \n\nI think it's a user issue rather than a grinder issue, though... the grind looked fantastic (especially compared to the visibly inconsistent grind I was getting on the KitchenAid).  Drip coffee makers are supposed to be a 7-9 grind setting on the Ode Gen 2, so I started with an 8 and dropped to a 7.  8 seemed about right in terms of extraction, but didn't have the fruity notes--7 may have been a little over-extracted, and still no blueberry.\n\nAny recommendations specific to either the Ode Gen 2 or grind size in general for relatively light-roasted coffee (maybe city+)?  Likewise, could the improved Ode grind mean that I need to adjust my water ratio, or is there something else I haven't thought of?  For reference, I'm running a cone filter coffee maker on SCA Gold settings.  Worst-case, I'll just revert to the KitchenAid to enjoy this batch, but I hate admitting defeat, and I'd also just like to learn/know for the future to be confident that I can grind appropriately to appreciate it on the occasions when I do luck out and \"hit a roast on the head\".\n\nThanks in advance!",

I don't understand the relative scales used by 1zpresso. I haven't seen any documentation that correlates clicks with mm or micron size grounds. \n\nFor example, for the K-ultra 1zpresso's documentation recommends a range of 5-7 for aeropress, which is 50 clicks from zero. If the interval between clicks is 20 microns as documentation indicates, that would seem to suggest that 50 clicks is equivalent to 1 mm or 1000 micron grounds. 500 is the general recommendation for aeropress, so that is a little confusing to me.\n\nAny insights?",
