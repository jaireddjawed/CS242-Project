        "text": " I'm currently living in a house share with one other person who for plenty of reasons I regret choosing as my housemate. As winter approached we agreed to be frugal with energy due to the sudden jump in prices and the fact that I'm just a student and have limited money with which to live off of. This meant only using the gas sparingly, e.g. to dry clothes and the occasional short blitz to keep pipes from freezing and agreeing for it to be when we were both in. For keeping ourselves warm outside of these times, we've been good at just adding layers and plenty of hot water bottles. It's not the most preferable solution but definitely a lot cheaper and it's honestly not been too bad, I've only put the heating on a handful of times.\n\nHowever, I've now had a look at the energy bill for the month that I was away and can see that after I left for a month over Christmas, the gas and electricity usage went up rather than down. Looking at it, it seems like now that he was alone, he was happy to heat the house as much as he liked. After I came back, this was still going to a lesser degree, even waking me up at night because he'd turned it on at 2am and my room became sweltering. I've brought it to him and he feigned ignorance and said he would stop turning it on unless we needed it.\n\nWith this and so many other issues I've had with this housemate, I'm considering just telling him he has to pay for his own usage for that month. Our energy bills are tied directly to usage which in this case was entirely him alone, I'm still paying my part for everything that wouldn't have gone down for my leaving, but I'm not subsidising his decision to spend carelessly after agreeing not to. We only have another 2 months on the tenancy and he's already broken any agreement of etiquette so I don't care about coming off petty. Plus if I have to pay it I'll need to sell off my furniture earlier than I was planning to, which includes all the living room stuff he spends all day on.",

Maltesers and minstrels you can tell straight away, so I knew what they would be before eating them. However, all the smaller irregular shaped ones were either orange, coffee or toffee. Loads of toffee - way too many. And not a single raisin.\n\nIt is safe to say I was outraged (and bloated) after finishing the bag. I checked the ingredients on the back, and the pack supposedly contained raisins. Yet I did not find a single one despite consuming all of them. I only bought the pack because I wanted a raisin revel. Are they hidden somewhere in the lining of the packaging? \n\nOn a serious note, how strong would this case be if I took it to court? The pack lied about its ingredients as there were no raisins. Also I now feel sick after eating 205g of chocolate in search of a raisin revel; if the pack had contained one (like it was supposed to), I would have stopped after finding one and wouldn’t have eaten all of them.",

It’s really not difficult &amp; when the carriage is silent, it’s unfathomable that people are happy to continue their conversations as if they’re at home. If you are one of these people, pack it in. \n\nLeniency for short/packed out trains, but come on guys.",

Gone online, hoping to get a quick estimated online quote for a product or service, next thing within seconds they’re ringing you trying to give you a better quote! It’s gotten to a point where I’ve just started putting false phone numbers in such as 070000etc or just random numbers now.\n\nFirst did it with Home Serve a few years back enquiring about a new boiler. They just wouldn’t take no for an answer, when I told them I couldn’t afford, they’d bombard me with finance offers instead. Go away!\n\nVitality have also been the worst, enquired about life insurance a few times over the last few years but never committed. Looked up a fresh quote a couple of months ago (with a baby on the way I thought I should get it) and I put a false number on the website. They’ve somehow found my real number, possibly from my past quotes which suggests GDPR breach? But hey ho.\n\nGirlfriend also tried a car finance quote with Zuto yesterday and they won’t leave her alone. I did a few years ago and had to block them too. \n\nIt’s frustrating! Do these companies really expect to make sales by bombarding customers?",
