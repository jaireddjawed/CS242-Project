One bought on Amazon and the other bought on a UK website/distributor.\n\nI wasn’t aware that these brands were not formally released in the uk as most their watches were pretty readily available through other sources.\n\nQuestion - what is thought on Orient Star? They have watches £2k+ which seems to be the opposite end of the spectrum that Orient is known for. Does anyone have one? What’s the quality like?",
