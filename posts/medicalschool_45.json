We all know that paying tens of thousands of dollars for the pre-clinical years is pretty much a scam. But how much would pre-clinical education cost using only third-party resources?\n\nSketchy - $600 (2-year subscription)\nBoards and Beyond - $400 (2-year sub.)\nPathoma - $120 (21-month sub.)\nPixorize - $500 ($250 per yearly sub.)\nBootcamp - $550 (2-year sub)\nFirst Aid Textbook - $50\nTotal cost:  $2220\n\nWith that said, the average cost of medical school (in the US) is roughly $60,000 per year (depending on public vs private institutions). Thus, total average cost of pre-clinical education is $120,000. That is a difference of $117,780.\n\nBut yeah, those school lectures are totally worth the extra $117,780… right?",

        "text": "[I’m sorry in advance that this is cheesy, poorly written, and far from unique] \n\nI go to medical school at a place with a big tertiary care hospital, level one trauma, all the who’s-its and what’s-its galore. I’ve sat in its cafeteria dozens of times over the past 4 years. It wasn’t until today, at the almost end of my 4th year, that I took the time to put into mediocre words how the hospital creates the most remarkable display of the human condition. \n\nI’m going into emergency medicine, so I’m no stranger to all the variety of life in healthcare, but sitting here really made me realize how awe-inspiring human life is and why this place is special. I’m watching a custodial woman, who should clearly be retired, use a fork to scrape caked-in food off the floor. To my left, the surgical techs sit together, revel at the schedule delays, and try to fathom how they’ll get all of today’s OR cases in. Behind me, the cooks are chatting about how much they pay in child support and being rich one day. Directly in front of me, a mother and her daughter wheel a chair-bound grandmother to the table, and they are so glad to have each other today. If I walk just around the hallway into the ED, I’ll go check on my patient who is in florid alcohol withdrawal and desperately needs an ICU bed, but there are none available. His nurse and doctor shrug their shoulders and repeatedly exchange “I hear you,” a newly developed, post-COVID, code that signals an attempt at understanding the unsolvable frustration of another, because the systems issues have bound us all physically, emotionally, and morally as healthcare implodes before us. On the fifth floor, there’s a man who’s losing his life partner and would give anything for another second with her, even if it was one with tear filled eyes. In the ICU is my 41 year old patient who was brought back to life after cardiac arrest and may just make it out of the hospital okay. Just around the corner in the resident room, the intern, who miscarried a week ago, gets spoken down to by a consultant and holds back tears. And at the same time, another baby is given life just one floor above. All of this, and so, so, so much more, in 15 seconds. \n\nMy god, I wish I was talented enough to relay the feelings with enough eloquence and justice. To be able to see the human condition in this way….is it both sickening and beautiful at the same time. To imbibe the deepest fears, the greatest joys, and the most nauseating uncertainties of multitudes of complete strangers on an hourly basis with a weird sense of banality forces me to believe the real phrase is “carry (it) on.” Really, what a heart wrenching piece of art we have created. I could stand in front of it for hours admiring how much it makes me want to look away. \n\nIt is simultaneously incredible and strange to experience some visceral, unconscious excitement about being in on the best kept secret that you didn’t want to know. What a privilege and a plague it is to be the .001% that see it, experience it, feel it, and understand it. And in the end, we will never really be able to share it with the other 99.999%.",

Our school had about 15-20 hrs of mandatory group work of 8, and had peer evaluation at the end of each semester within those groups. I am a naturally quiet, introspective person and never felt that I fit in both in medical school settings and clinical settings, and so tried my best to fit into the culture. Unfortunately, doing so has f'ed up my sense of self, my studies, my health both physical and mental. \n\nI am debating whether to go back to medicine or to find a different career. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar and managed to go back and find success in the rest of their medical journey?",

For some background, I initially wanted to start a Minorities in Medicine club in order to combat healthcare discrepancies and due to the fact that there are so many resources that minorities don't know about regarding medicine. The plan was to provide resources such as speakers, scholarships, overall knowledge on jobs within the field, etc. targeted towards minority groups. However, my institution was against the idea and claimed that it was exclusive towards majority of students with medical interests and urged me to focus on inclusivity (even though there is already a program targeted towards students with healthcare interests and I just wanted to start something to provide resources geared towards minorities ). Hence, I rebranded in order to focus on combating the overall issue of health inequity. I want the club to be open to all majors since the issue requires different perspectives and the issue is so broad that I believe there is room for every field. I am still going to focus on providing resources for minorities however, I would love some insight on how to expand in the ways that I previously mentioned. Any advice or criticisms would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I wonder if the same thing is happening with medical schools by pulling out of rankings they're setting up to take a less objective and more holistic approach to admissions.\n\nSee this [https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/eliminating-bias-medical-school-admissions](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/eliminating-bias-medical-school-admissions)\n\n&gt;Less reliance on MCAT and GPA scores, and a more holistic view of the whole student, could drastically increase the number of Black medical students, one dean argues.\n\nI wonder if they're trying to prevent stuff like in the Harvard SCOTUS case where they \"deliberately discriminated against *Asian* American applicants because of their race\"\n\nBy going to less objective criteria like essays and eliminating objective measures it's harder to prove discrimination\n\nIn the big picture as long as USMLE pass marks keep rising I guess it doesn't really matter, everyone is still being pushed to high level of competence.",

        "text": "Long story short, I broke out crying in front of my supervisor twice on the same day. Research and the fuck-ups I had during it have me under a lot of pressure right now, and I felt reminded of everything that went wrong during the whole day, everyday for the last two weeks. I had been fighting back the tears during that whole time (locking myself in the bathroom to let it out intermittently). Then came the day when the tears just started coming (still tried to keep a straight face, but what good does that do when you're choked up and clearly there are tears rolling?). First time she gave me a hug, second time she stood awkwardly and asked if I wanted to go home. I said yes, packed my stuff and left for the day. I worry about how this changed her perception of me and if I will ever be able to work there again.\n\nIf you have had a similar experience, it may help to know that you're not alone. While it's something we try to avoid, sometimes when everything gets too much this stuff just happens. We're still human after all. So I hope this experience can be useful in some way for others.",

        "text": "CW: suicide and self harm\n\nI’m an MS1 at a T5 med school and I’ve had a very difficult time over the last several months.  Academically, I’ve been great and have done well on every exam so far (my school is P/F for pretty much everything but I wasn’t barely passing anything).  However, I had a housing situation early in the year that brought out the worst in me.  I texted some not very nice things to people (not threats… but comments came out of left field) while intoxicated and those people weren’t very happy about that.  They reported me to the Dean of Students, and I ended up moving to another apartment (which I’m happy about).  However, I’ve also been on thin ice with the administration about any similar incidents. \n\nI was doing quite well and things seemed to have been getting better over the last few months, especially in terms of my mental health and substance use.   However, there was a similar allegation made against me recently.  The Dean believed that it was me based on my past behavior (even though there wasn’t any actual proof that it was me). He told me that either I would be put on administrative leave pending a disciplinary hearing that, in his words, would likely lead me to be dismissed from med school or that I could voluntarily choose to take a year long personal leave of absence, during which I am to not speak to any med students and not to have any further allegations—which would lead to me being immediately dismissed from med school. \n\nI felt really pressured into taking the personal leave of absence. It will be recorded as a personal leave of absence with not information about why it happened in my MSPE (nothing about the context of the LOA will be on there) so I don’t think I have to explain the situation in residency apps.  However, the loa means that I’ll lose my health insurance (and mental health care )soon, will be isolated from the friends that I did make in med school and won’t have financial aid to pay for living expenses for the upcoming year.\n\nI’m devastated, stressed and scared about what to do now.  There is so much shame and guilt about this whole situation. I love med school and everything I’ve done in the classroom and the clinic.  However, I feel like I’m trapped in a never ending nightmare and I don’t even know if I can even make it through med school at this point. \n\nMy mood has been going from slight slivers of hope to immense depression. Thoughts of killing myself have been flooding my mind.  I’m not sure if I can handle dealing with this for a year.  \n\nI was thinking about trying to salvage this year and turn it into a unofficial research year.  Im not sure how doable that is since it’s right in the middle of my first year.  \n\nAny advice? I really need it.",

Well everything was fine until I started looking at their old exams and realised they have learned things in much more detail then I have, especially anatomy. Now I feel like I don’t know enough and that I’m a failure. I have acquired a brutal imposter syndrome. I’m honestly not sure if I can even become a good enough doctor. Will I learn these details during the clinical parts or will i be doomed to be a bad doctor? Should I redo this last year to cover up for what I don’t know? This is of course expensive and would costs me a lot of money. In reality, I understand that everyone who studied at my last school did not become a horrible doctor, but the opposite, they really were quite good. But my current school has such a high standard I feel like an imposter who won’t be as good as my peers.",

Any advice is appreciated.\n\nDuring preclinical years I was hyperfocused on matching urology. All my research, EC's, etc have a focus on urology in some way. Leader of urology SIG, decent # of posters and a few pubs. With no urology home program, I've even networked mentors from other institutions as well.\n\nAfter completing a 2-week elective, I realized quickly that urology may not be the right specialty for me. Plus, after going through all the rotations I learned I've liked pretty much every specialty. I've found myself really attached to DR for the complex diagnostic skill and mastery of anatomy to become a radiologist. The problem is I have no rads research/involvement in my CV. I also don't have a home DR program. Both specialties are respectably competitive and I wonder what I could do now that would help my chances.\n\nHaving a P/F step 1, a mix of HP/H clinical grades, I'm staring down the barrel of step 2 while at the same time trying to figure out away rotations, and applying for ERAS this fall is added stress.\n\nWhat should I do that can help my chances with a late specialty decision? How do I go about away rotations? Any advice is appreciated, especially for those who were in the same shoes. Thanks in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: changing from urology -&gt; DR late third year with heavy urology CV and no DR research. Advice appreciated",

        "text": "I've never thought about any career other than medicine, but even since the early days of knowing what med school is, I've gotten nervous thinking about anatomy lab. I've never liked being around dead people (even my own family's funerals), and I literally passed out the first time I toured an anatomy lab at 18. Before we started lab last fall, I was having panic attacks every night worrying about what it would be like and I cried from anxiety when we finally went in. As we had more lab periods, I became less nervous, but I'm still not as chill as my classmates yet. \n\nI'm embarrassed. I want to be brave. I want to not be nervous. I want to be more useful to my partners (although one is more than happy to get the extra hands-on time that would be shared with me otherwise, so I don't feel too bad about that). I try to learn all the material beforehand and I'm able to point out structures as they're cutting, but the most hands-on I've been was cleaning fat off of a heart so we could see blood vessels. Being in that room makes me so nervous and this is with our cadaver's face covered and after the class above us has taken most of the muscle and skin off. I'm terrified to think of what it will be like when we get to head and neck dissections on fresh cadavers in the fall. \n\nIt's frustrating when people tell me to \"just get over it\" because if it were that easy, I would have already done that. I get mad at myself for having these feelings. Has anybody else had this fear? How did you make it through? My professor always says the cadavers are the nicest patients we'll ever have, but there are some days when I'd rather deal with a mean living patient than go into that lab. The worst part for me is the regret as I'm leaving. In the moment, I'm terrified to do anything other than flip through Netter's, but as I walk out the door, I think to myself, “That wasn't too bad. I should've done more.\" Then in the next lab period, I'm back to being terrified. It's like a battle between two parts of my brain. Part of me knows nothing bad will happen; they're dead and can't hurt me and they donated everything they had left for me to learn. I want to respect their donation by being an active participant, but the other part of me is paralyzed when the bag gets unzipped and I stay up late some nights, heart racing, unable to sleep and dreading going back.\n\nUltimately, I do feel like there is hope for me to become more comfortable in lab because it’s something I really want to happen and I’m willing to take steps toward this goal. I’m proud of myself for how far I’ve come, but I don’t know how to keep going and make meaningful progress.",
