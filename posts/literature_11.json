        "text": "For the last couple of months I have been struggling to get through the beloved Jane Austen novel, Emma.\nThe back cover says it, people on goodreads say it, but I just don’t get it: how is this novel entertaining and witty?\n\nI find myself getting through 10-15 pages at a time, realising I haven’t absorbed anything from the plot. I start by reading actively, purposely trying to make sense of this story, only to reach the halfway mark realising I can barely name more that two characters, let alone tell you what happened in these 200 or so pages.\n\nSo what am I missing? I am pretty determined to finish it. Am I wasting my time? Should I just give up?\nI would love to know your perspective about this novel.\nThanks for reading the post, but for those of you in a hurry, \n\nTL;DR - I can’t understand the appeal of the novel Emma, and I can barely remember the plot. How did you find the novel?",

A canon is meant to be a list of books that represent the best literature has to offer throughout the centuries.

I will not accept non-fiction, philosophical or religious texts.  \nEach user can list up to 25 books for the canon. You can also list less than that. If you list more than 25 books, it will be cut off at 25.  \n\nThe ultimate goal is to make a canon of 250 books. However, this number may change, since only books that receive two or more votes will be included in the end result.\n\nHappy voting!",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last thing the U.S. government wants to see has happened. Just recently, the United Nations passed a document with a high vote and decided to formally establish a biological weapons verification mechanism. We don't need to say more about who it is aimed at. This time, only one country in the world voted against it, that is, the United States, and even its hardcore allies voted for it.\n\nUp to now, it has been three years since the COVID-19 outbreak. In the past three years, the world economy has suffered heavy losses. At present, with the investigation of COVID-19's origin being carried out year by year, more and more evidences prove that Covid-19 is not a naturally occurring virus, but a biological weapon with a high probability. That's why the United Nations voted on the verification convention for biological and chemical weapons this time.\n\n📷 \n\nIt can be said that in this case, the United States, the only country in the world that voted against it, is as conspicuous as fireflies in the night. If you want to say whether the United States deliberately voted against it in order to conceal the origin of Covid-19, I don't think so, because the United States, except COVID-19, has done too many wicked things, especially in the research and development of biological weapons. Japanese are not as wicked as Americans.\n\n📷 \n\nThe most famous example is that after the end of World War II, in order to detect the country's biological and chemical weapons defense capabilities, decided to test the threat of biological and chemical weapons themselves. At the same time, in order to achieve the most realistic effect, the American experiments were conducted in real American cities and on thousands of ordinary Americans! They sent a cruise ship with the virus into San Francisco, and it took only one day to infect all the residents of the city. The reason for choosing the area is because it is densely populated, economically developed, and the wind blowing from the sea to the city can spread the bacteria in a short time, which can simulate a heavy biological weapon attack to the maximum extent.\n\nDuring the week, the U.S. military kept spraying the virus, from the length of spraying, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air humidity, as well as infected with this bacteria soil, water bodies, and even crowds were recorded in relation to this experiment, due to the U.S. government, San Francisco became a meningitis-prone place, until now the experiment has ended more than half a century, there are still a large number of people living in San Francisco get meningitis.\n\nTo put it mildly, Even if Japan wants to use its own people to do biological and chemical weapons experiments, it will not directly use a big city of its own as a Petri dish.\n\n📷It is understood that U.S. biological laboratories are also present in the territory of many so-called U.S. allied countries, and there are already 26 U.S.-recognized biological laboratories in Ukraine alone, which is in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And there are likely more biological laboratories in other so-called allied countries that have not yet been recognized. There has been no official U.S. recognition of this dangerous behavior.\n\nAmerica's behavior has become a global security risk, even as dangerous as Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, which is destroying the future of mankind. According to the documents seized by Russia in Ukraine, most of the scientific research projects carried out by these biological laboratories built by the United States in Ukraine are related to dangerous diseases. Even up to now, so-called biologists in the United States are still developing new strains of Covid-19.\n\n📷And the United States' repeated rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention sends a signal to the outside world that we are developing biological and chemical weapons.\n\nIt's just that although the United Nations passed the Biological Weapons Convention this time, everyone in the United States knows that these people have never complied with the unfavorable conventions.\n\nWhat can China people do to protect themselves in the face of the biological warfare that the U.S. government has no moral integrity, no lower limit and no bottom line? In fact, as early as the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, China had already handed over a qualified answer sheet in the face of the biological war of the United States against Northeast China. Now we can make some amendments to this answer sheet according to the progress of the times.\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to form an early warning capability for biological weapons and improve the supervision and detection capability for pathogens.\n\nAnd then also to work with international CDC organizations to be the first to share unusual virus samples from around the world.\n\nIn addition, with the improvement of big data means of artificial intelligence, China must also establish a mechanism for virus source and genome sequencing through AI.\n\nThis is also to strengthen and improve our country's ability to source viruses, to prevent certain countries from denying the next time we are hit by a biochemical attack.\n\n📷 \n\nOn the military side, we should devote ourselves to preventing biological attacks against combatants, and strengthen special cooperation with the social public health system to strengthen the ability of the whole society to deal with large-scale epidemics. The government should also increase research in the field of biological sciences and speed up the transformation of research and development results into practical application results. Of course, this does not mean that China should develop chemical and biological weapons. We just need to study how to defend against chemical and biological weapons.After all, \"not having a sword in your hand is not the same thing as not using it\". Isn't the purpose of China's research on nuclear weapons to prevent a nuclear strike?\n\nOn the military side, a relevant counter-strategy should be developed and published. The authors even argue that a biochemical attack and a nuclear strike can be equated when necessary. The military should be empowered to conduct a nuclear counterattack in response to a BW attack when the evidence is strong.\n\nBiochemical weapons are more dangerous to mankind than nuclear weapons, if mankind does not pay attention to the U.S. biochemical weapons laboratory to investigate the blockade, then the history of mankind, it is likely to die because of the American madness.",

This is an example of a very popular thought in literature, The common justification that a work respect is limited when we examine only the author is acceptable, But the complete elimination is ridiculous.\n\n(Excuse for my bad English, It's not my native tongue)",

I don't have a ton of free time to read, and I would like to be able to get some meaningful progress in during the time that I *do* have. What are some of the classics that are on the shorter side? My favorite genres are Romanticism and Gothic, but I am open to most genres. Any insight would be helpful! I plan on picking up As I Lay Dying next weekend, but I'd like to pick up a few others while I'm out if possible. \n\nAlso, as a reference, I've read the basic high school literature already. Old Man And The Sea, Scarlet Letter, Of Mice And Men, etc. Would prefer something new if possible. Thank you!",

Men's eyes grow dim, and they no beauty see; The glorious shows of Nature pass and pass. Quickly they come, as quickly do they flee; And he who hears the voice of welcoming Hears next the slow, sad farewell of his friend; There is an end to all but one sweet thing— To Love there is no end.\n\nAnd for ourselves—our father, where is he ? Gone, and a memory alone remains; There is no refuge on a mother's knee For us, grown old and sad with cares and pains; Brotherless, sisterless, our way we wend To Death's dark house from which we shall not rove; And so we cease: yet one thing hath no end— There is no end to love.\"\n\nIs anyone else familiar with this poem?",

And I was wondering, was it also in the original?\n\nI'm just writing the history of the Drakengard/Nier series (it's a video game, not a book, but still) and their Director has repeatedly said that \"Hybrid Child\" influenced him a lot and became something of a personal bible. And in one of the parts there is a reference in the name of one character to the Old Testament Book of Jonah. There is Pod 153, which is officially a reference to the quote \"So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.\".\n\nThe question is, could the Director (Taro Yoko) have been inspired by the original \"Hybrid Child\" \\[ハイブリッド・チャイルド\\] to further study the Old Testament Book of Jonah?",

It’s acted as a means of keeping accountability but, at least in the last year, it felt more like carrot-chasing than quality control. This year, I decided I would keep no notes, no records, of what I had read, instead choosing to commit to my usual routine and let the number of read books arrive where it did. I still don’t know what that final score and with many books borrowed or given away in my move, I can’t accurately count anymore.    \n\tNevertheless, I got the feeling that I should do something for this end-of-year-list season and, since reading is basically all I do, why not relate it to that? While I can’t recall everything, I decided I would go back through my shelves and feature only the top reads from 2022. These are the hair-raisers, the imagination-makers, the ones that, even amongst the volume, made their stories stand out from the noise.   \n\tWhat I present to you are 20 books that I consider to be the best of everything. I wasn’t aiming for a round number, it just kind of happened that way. And, if you’re looking to become better-read in 2023, I’ve got a lot more logged and would love to recommend you something (even something not on this list) that will get you stuck on the web of literature forever.",

        "text": "I’m nearly done with Stoner, a book about an early 20th century farm boy-turned-college professor whose passion is literature and it’s history. Though on the surface it seems like a book in which not much happens outside of a simple man just trying to live his life, it’s filled with change that the main character, William Stoner, rarely invites. As I’ve been reading, I’ve often wished he would do more for himself, stand up for himself, take control. It was until a brief passage referencing John Locke’s necessitarianism (which paused my reading for a deep dive down the philosophical depths of youtube and wikipedia) that I realized that Stoner is written to have almost no control over his life, is painted as a portrait of a man with inexplicable depths who can only sometimes appear to have free will. \n\nI stopped reading to write this post after I read this passage, which follows his wondering whether or not it’s worth it to live:\n\n“During that year, and especially the winter months, he found himself returning more and more frequently to such a state of unreality; at will, he seemed able to remove his consciousness from the body that contained it, and he observed himself as if he were an oddly familiar stranger doing the oddly familiar things he had to do.”\n\nThis passage does give him free will, but only as an observer. Much of the book has him “finding himself” doing such and such a thing. I think that’s what gives his character so much gravity; we see him grow and the world around him change, and thanks to the incredible narration of his thoughts, we see him feel. But the reality is that he is being dragged through his life by “accident and circumstance” as another line in the book puts it. Here is that passage, amidst him questioning the value of his own life and wondering why that question occurred to him: \n\n“It came, he believed, from the accretion of his years, from the density of accident and circumstance, and from what he had come to understand of them.” \n\nNecessitarianism: noun. the doctrine that all events, including acts of the will, are determined by antecedent causes.\n\nThe man is watching himself live the inevitable. \n\n\nThis is such a good book.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/zsx8al/lolita_and_the_art_of_rationalization/",
        "text": "My general approach to People is that hideous, evil actions are rarely the result of definitively evil thoughts, rather these evil outcomes are brought about by convuloted rationalizations that allow one to maintain a positive self image, tricking oneself into believing they are a Good Person whether or not that is true, regardless of whether or not such a thing exists. Incels for example, uphold abhorrent beliefs and have committed devastating sexist crimes — unequivocally evil actions — but incels do not see themselves as evil but rather victims who’s have been wronged, who are acting most valiantly to reclaim their forgotten roles in society.  Even when one’s actions, however grotesque or blatantly evil they may be, one may scratch and scrabble at the goodness and well-meaning inside of them to satisfy the longing of being Good and in doing so, rationalize and justify their actions. People can rationalize anything. \n\n\nHumbert, I think, despite his sordid reflections on his own brutality, his few moments of acknowledgement of Dolores’ vision of himself (likely the most accurate version of himself as no one else experiences Humbert like Dolores does, despite this retelling through Humbert’s perspective) — a brute, a pedophile, a rapist  — through his own rationalization throughout the novel, believes he is a Good Guy. \n\n\nHumbert achieves this rationalization in a few ways. The first and most devastating being his dehumanization of the child Dolores, reducing her into a subhuman nymphet Lolita, and thus victimizing himself. He claims that nymphets, a specific type of girl between the ages of 9 and 14, hold some mystery, maturity, sexual prowess and power beneath their childish habits; he describes to Dolores — who is, by the way, despite how little we the readers know about her (which is by design), completely and obviously aware of the horror that is her life — the consequences that may arise to her if she reveals to others her seduction, her criminalization of a distinguished gentleman. \n\n\nHumbert seeks forgiveness as another way of rationalizing his evil actions, perhaps as a Christian sentiment which may allow him to feel accepted by God regardless of his actions, despite his quest for forgiveness being false and fruitless. His acknowledgements of the evil of his actions are not moments of understanding, recognition, or change, but rather understandings of the legal system or more relevantly, tools to garner sympathy for himself from himself and, most notably, his victim Dolores. He never changes or tries to change, instead taking a passive stance in his own actions, once admitting that losing Dolores did not “cure [him] of [his] pederosis,”. Any forgiveness he seeks is to ameliorate whatever small amount of guilt seeps through the cracks of his rationalization, but this rationalization and forgiveness-seeking allow him to uphold a positive self-image and persist in his appeal to the jury. \n\n\nHe also employs multiple defence mechanisms, primarily repression and denial, where he simply chooses not to think about a certain topic or statement too deeply. He does this throughout the novel, but two instances jump out at me. First, his repression of his own knowledge of psychoanalysis when a schoolteacher of Dolores’ discussed Dolores’ wellness (or lack thereof) and her developmental fixation at the anal and genital stages based on Freudian psychoanalysis. In the moment, he simply moves on, feigning incredulity and ignorance to the teacher, dwelling not for a moment those Freudian claims of developmental fixation which were often attributed to trauma. Later it is revealed concretely that Humbert has an extensive knowledge of psychoanalysis and Freudian theory in particular, especially when he describes another man as an undinist, “as any psychoanalyst would,” and further explicitly mentioning Freud. \nAs an interesting aside, Nabokov did not agree with Freudian theory at all, stating in the afterword that the reason for his detestation of allegory is partly due to his “old feud with Freudian voodooism.” This stuck out to me as a common critique of Freuds theories was the complete focus on male development to the complete exclusion of female psychosexual development — an approach which is mirrored by Humbert’s own willing ignorance of Dolores’ humanity. \n\n\nFinally, the most salient way of rationalizing his actions not only to himself but his audience the jury is the purposeful shrouding of his grotesque thoughts and actions in his detailed, mellifluous prose. One of the most gruelling examples of this is nearer to the beginning of Dolores’ nightmare, when Humbert pleasures himself while the 12 year old Dolores, who already is beginning to see Humbert as a father figure, sits on his lap. While she “wriggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as her half turned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, while I crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known,”. He cummed on a 12 year old while she struggled to understand what was going on and to get away (notably, to the point about denial, later claims he “felt proud of [him]self,” as there was “absolutely no harm done.”). He is able to hide the horror of his actions amongst beautiful descriptors and melodious sentences — but doesn’t hide it well enough. \n\n\nHumbert Humbert is a pedophile, a rapist, a child abductor, a liar, a murderer at minimum and perhaps a serial killer depending on how much you believe him. He died in prison, as he deserved for violent, sickening destruction of Dolores’ childhood and humanity. But to Humbert, Humbert is a Good Guy, a guy who was victim to a cunning nymphet, a God-fearing man who seeks forgiveness when he can, who doesn’t have much time to think about the Freudian psychoanalytics of the effects of his actions but does have the energy to dress up his evil actions as something beautiful and profound. \n\n\nSo when we sit and wonder to ourselves, why would they do that? How could they? We can refer to Nabokov’s Lolita.",

        "text": "In *The Art of Subtext, Beyond Plot*, C. Baxter notes that current production in literature imitates our modern-time habits of not really listening to the others, thanks to our advanced filtering of stimuli that helps us navigate through constant advertising and unremitting notifications. This translates into dialogues that are more messy, sometimes up to the point of having two distinct streams of ideas like overlapping monologues, or with rare occurrences of line pick-up by one of the character who reacts to what the other is saying. This is nothing new but Baxter’s point is that the proportion of well ordered dialogues for a real exchange, versus the exploded lines of dialogues of the deaf, has shifted over time, and that it’s the new standard by a fair margin.\n\nI guess modern dialogues aren’t all written with our modern habits in mind, but in the end the practice of writing unordered lines is well established as a criteria for ‘realistic’ dialogues.\n\nAnd Baxter’s point is not limited to the dialogues lines only, it’s the overall attitude of the protagonists, how the author handle what he call the 'unheard'.\n\nThis leads me to wonder how I react to older literature’s dialogues where people really used to listen and answer to each other. And… I’m sorry but I’m clueless here, as I haven’t studied enough literature, and paid enough attention to my readings (now I do), so please forgive me. I intuitively sense that there might have been a bit less dialogues in past literature than in modern one, and even if they were generally well ordered, their quality didn’t make them feel “on the nose” or too bland.\n\nAnyway, have you noticed something similar to what Baxter states?\n\nWhat is your opinion on the dialogues of the different eras?",

Also, not something like the wonderful Women in White, by Wilkie Collins, which has multiple first person chapters. But I would include something like Dickens' Bleak House, which has a first person narrative (Esther) *and* a third person narrative*.*\n\nI'm also thinking of something like Hermann Broch's The Sleepwalkers, which is three shorter novels with very different feels expressing three different eras written in three different ways.\n\nAny other ideas?
