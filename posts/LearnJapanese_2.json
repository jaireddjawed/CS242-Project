Currently I'm in my fourth month of Japanese working my way through N4-N5, I'm using this YouTube playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLag_mhJfCJ-18WyYoklCPxIpYbeRgmWLJ\n\nI've noticed that the first video has 1.7 million views, and the last has only 34K. That is a 0.02% follow through rate. Of course not all of these are people giving up, people might change over to different resources, obviously many people are part way through, but if I had to guess, it seems like at least 90% of people give up. And that's not even the amount of people who give up trying to learn Hirgana, videos such as https://youtu.be/wD3FJgij79c have 28,000,000 views, the ratio of people who finish (or just learn competent Japanese) to people who start is unbelievably low.\n\nSo that all said, I want to be the odds but it is quite stacked against me. What do you guys remind yourself to keep.you motivated? I'd love to here from people at a stage further than me. I'm travelling to Japan in January so knowing some Japanese, even just maybe N3 level I think could greatly enrich my experience.",

While the word \"God\" in anime and manga seems to be used as a description to mean really good or beast. In fact, while watching sub I have noticed that usually the word \"God\" could be perfectly substituted with the word expert. I find this really interesting and was wondering where does this difference come from. How do the Japanese view God and the word \"God\"?",

I'm not sure if i'm doing it optimally, and it feels tedious to me compared to what I've been doing before as I'll explained in 2 paragraphs.\n\nFor each Kanji do people really remember the meaning(s) and all readings and the readings in each didactic vocab (+their meaning)?\n\nFor context on what I've done, I've only really done vocab reps on Anki for learning Kanji and words. I initially did 15-20 cards per day of recognition+reading+(writing) and after a bit I dropped recall/writing because I realised that I just wanted to study written text. I was not very far through the deck. That's why when I got to KKLC and all vocab+readings of words I was wondering \"How many words per day can people whilst remembering so many readings..\" since it feels tedious due to me.\n\nMy goal is to understand written text, so I've been thinking would it just be better to remember kanji meanings+vocab and ignore readings? But if that's the case, would be better to just go back to Anki vocab decks? At this point I'm not sure how I should be studying.",

For those that are interested, figures related to the results can be found at the link below.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGOeTY0gPjZEmnxwK5lN\\_9uoh-0zUeGo?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGOeTY0gPjZEmnxwK5lN_9uoh-0zUeGo?usp=sharing)\n\nI’d like to thank everyone who took the time to complete the survey. In total, **I received 101 completed responses**. **Respondents included language learners of 32 different foreign languages** with Japanese, English, Spanish, German, and French being the most studied languages among the participants. Notably, the survey included learners of several less commonly studied languages such as Esperanto, Turkish, Tagalog, along with 17 other languages that were studied by a single participant each.\n\n**The most common uses of ChatGPT for foreign language learning were:** **1. conversation practice (24.7%), 2. language learning material (18.8%), 3. vocabulary (17.8%), 4. grammar (12.8%), and 5. corrective feedback (8.9%)**.\n\nThe Likert items (5-point scale) were based on the two primary constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989): perceived usability (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). **TAM-based results were mixed**–participants were split on the PU of ChatGPT for foreign language learning while most respondents had favorable views of the PEOU of ChatGPT to learn a foreign language.\n\nSeveral themes were identified from the open-ended responses. **The most frequently commented on themes were: 1. Accuracy (52.4%), 2. Accessibility (21.7%), 3. Convenience (17.8%), 4. Limited usability (14.8%), and 5. Personalized language learning (8.9%).** The themes related to accuracy and accessibility were exhibited in both positive and negative ways. Specifically, four respondents remarked positively about ChatGPT accuracy while 49 had negative comments about the tool’s accuracy. For accessibility, 19 respondents’ comments were identified as positive and three were identified as negative.\n\nThanks again for your help and feel free to leave comments and questions below!",

Play as an alien, run around Earth, and build up your vocabulary to battle robots. That's the goal, anyway: we're still in active development right now, but you can check out our current build for free on Steam, iOS, and Android. Right now we offer 24 different languages, and support Japanese with options for kanji, hiranaga, and romaji.\n\nOur recent update focused on introducing the main story. Your alien has crash-landed and needs to rebuild their spaceship; explore 8 unique levels, and fight a big boss battle to get them back in the sky. Right now, we’re aiming to build side quests for each level, and to add more variety to the combat system. Combat is turn-based in JRPG-style, inspired by games like Dragon Quest, where your attacks get more powerful the closer you get to spelling your words correctly.\n\nIf you'd like to support our development, be sure to check us out! The game is free to download on most major platforms. We’re still in active development, so hearing your feedback is super important for us. If you've got ideas or suggestions for things you'd like to see in future updates, hop on over to [our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earthlingo/) and be sure to let us know :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarthlingo is free to download here:\n\n[Windows &amp; Linux](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1071240/)\n\n[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1472136498)\n\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simify.earthlingo)\n\nThanks for reading!",

I've learned of a few particles such as ga, wa, ni, o, do. But to be honest, I'm having a hard time remembering which context each are used in. Wa is easy for me, for the most part it comes after talking about either myself or someone else as the subject. But the rest I can't seem to remember. \n\nI'm currently using the HeyJapan app to learn, which has been helpful to some degree, but I find that there isn't enough repetition and its very fast-paced between topics. \nAny tips on reading, writing &amp; speaking sentences would be greatly appreciated! Feel free to recommend apps/other resources that can help as well!",

So 悪戯も should be \"also pranks\" or \"even pranks\"\n\nここまで - This should be \"up to here\", or \"to this extent\"\n\n手が - Why is \"hand\" here? And followed by the が particle? Is \"hand\" the subject here?\n\n込んでると - This is the -te form + ru of 込む, which is \"to be crowded\" or, in this case, \"to be complex\". This is then followed by the と particle, which may or may not be a conjuction of two phrases with \"strong causal relationship\"... something like that?\n\nまあまあ - \"so-so, now; there\" uhmmm... sorrywut?\n\nかな - ending particles, which is \"I wonder\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, should this be interpreted like this? \"I wonder if (they) now even make (手?) pranks so complex\".

I’ve plugged this into DeepL for some assistance, but I’d like some human eyes as well, as I’m a bit confused about some things. For example, what is the song about? I’m stuck between “falling in love with a sailor” and “losing a loved one to the sea.” Im also confused about what meaning of “misaki” is being used in different places. Here’s the song on YT: https://youtu.be/PfnuHGmVqS8\n\n\nWhat I have for the lyrics:\n\n風のみさき\n\n波音もかき消してゆく\nやまない風のみさきで\nこうしてかたを並べてた\nまだあの日のまま\n\n君のそばで君と歩く\n足跡は人にふんでも\n君の海を君と歩く\nずっと先も歩く\n\n初めて出会った最初の日\n再会はその次の日\n二人が愛を誓ったのも\nこのみさきだった\n\n君のそばで君と歩く\n足跡は人にふんでも\n君の海を君と歩く\nずっと先も歩く\n\n海に浮かぶ君を呼んだ\n君は手をふった\nあの日だけは風が呼んでた\nざわつくむねが\nなみが\n海が\n\n君をさらい\n君をうばい\n君は海へとかえってく\n君はきっとゆるせっていう\n君が愛した海を\n\n君のそばで君と歩く\n足跡は人にふんでも\n君の海を君と歩く\nずっと先も歩く\n\nDrowning out the sound of waves\nIn the direction of the endless wind\nLike this, we walked side by side\nStill the same as that day\n\nI walk with you by your side\nthough your footprints are trampled by others\nI'll walk with you on your sea\nI'll walk with you forever and ever\n\nThe first day we met\nAnd the day after that we met again\nThe day we pledged our love\nIt was here in (misaki)\n\nI'll walk with you by your side\nEven though your footprints are trampled by others\nI'll walk by your sea with you\nI'll walk on forever\n\nI called to you as you floated in the sea\nYou waved your hand\nOnly that day, the wind was calling to you\nAnd my pounding heart\nAnd the waves \nAnd the sea\n\nThe sea swept you away\nThe sea stole you away\nYou return to the sea\nYou’ll surely tell me that I should forgive\nThe sea you loved so much\n\nI'll walk with you by your side\nEven though your footprints are trampled by others\nI'll walk by your sea with you\nI'll walk on forever",

        "text": "An example of a recent conversation I had with ChatGPT:\n\n&gt; **Me:** Hello! What is the difference between 対面 and 面会??\n&gt; \n&gt; **ChatGPT:** Both 対面 and 面会 are Japanese terms that refer to a meeting or an encounter with someone in person. However, there is a subtle difference between the two.\n&gt; \n&gt; 対面 (taimen) refers to a face-to-face meeting or encounter, which can be formal or informal. It implies that two people are meeting in person and looking directly at each other. This term is often used in a business or professional context.\n&gt; \n&gt; 面会 (menkai) also means a face-to-face meeting, but it is more commonly used in a legal or correctional context. It refers specifically to a meeting with someone who is in custody or imprisoned, such as a prisoner or a defendant. In this context, the term implies a more formal meeting, often with restrictions or supervision.\n&gt; \n&gt; In summary, while both terms refer to in-person meetings, 対面 is a more general term that can be used in various contexts, whereas 面会 is a more specific term often used in a legal or correctional context.\n\n\nIs the AI correct?\n\nHave any of you tried asking chatGPT questions and received false information? I wonder if I can trust its replies.",

The way I see it is that you have a dedicated teacher to guide you every step of the way as well as receiving instant practice with a native.\n\nWhat’s your reasons? Do you just prefer self study?\n\nFor fun, I booked a lesson with a tutor in a few days just to see how the experience is. My current technique has been to call people on HelloTalk and practice but I have been curious how it will differ with a professional language teacher.",
