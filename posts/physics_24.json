I wondered if you could create a list of laws from  which -- given enough time, brain power, and computing power -- all of our current physics could be reconstructed. \n\nMy first thought was you can just about get all of classical kinematics and non-relativistic quantum mechanics from nothing but Noether's theorem and Hamilton's principle. That's not super important to the present discussion but I'm curious if anyone has thoughts on that.\n\nMy thoight then turned to relativity and Maxwell's equations. I've not dealt with relativity all too much but I knew that Kaluza-Klein theory (while we know it can't be entirely correct) shows us how to get Maxwell's equations from Einstein's field equations. \n\nBut on the most fundamental level, where do Einstein's field equations come from? It seems to me that you can just about derive special *and* general relativity just from the second postulate of special relativity and Einstein's equivalence principle. \n\nBut the second postulate of relativity comes pretty directly *from* Maxwell's equations! So what is more fundamental: Einstein's field equations or Maxwell's equations? If Maxwell's equations are more fundamental, then it really shouldn't be all too surprising that we can get Maxwell's equations back out of general relativity, right? \n\nThis is a bit of rambling, shower-thought stuff but I thought it might provoke interesting discussion.",

First, she heats the water with the steam nozzle of her coffee machine (the steam temperature T₂ is higher than the boiling temperature of water, i.e. over 100 °C). At the same time, she adds a few ice cubes of known mass (mIce) from the refrigerator, which have a temperature T3 below the melting point, i.e. below 0 °C. Our experimenter wonders how one could calculate what water temperature (Tmix) will occur? Help her by writing down the conditional equation with which you could answer the question if all the information was given. Assume that the temperature of the water increases (Tmix&gt; T1). You don't need to enter any values ​​or do any calculations, you should only describe the individual variables in an understandable way. \n\n\nI am in 11th grade Swiss higher high school",

        "text": "I was recently discussing coriolis with a flat earther (dont laugh).\nI was trying to educate him on what the coriolis actually does in terms of how it affects things on earth.   I think I actually got through to him in terms of making him question his understanding of how coriolis applies to the earth.  In his mind, coriolis would be greatest at the equator and least at the poles, since the tangential velocity is greatest at the equator.  I actually explained this is NOT true, and this can be demonstrated by a Foucault pendulum as there is no precession at the equator, and greater and greater precession as you move further from the equator, with the direction of precession switching between northern and southern hemisphere.   I think I got through to him at least in terms of his mis understanding, (but he still thinks the earth is flat).   My question though, I took the next step of asking him with this new understanding, if you are on a 2 dimensional rotating surface (like a merry go round, as opposed to a sphere), where would the coriolis force be greatest and where would it be least (at the center vs at the outer edge).   I asked this question thinking I knew the answer.   But then I started 2nd guessing myself, so I thought I might try to ask somewhere else and get other opinions on this.   So I will ask this subreddit:  regarding coriolis force as it applies to a rotating 2 dimensional surface (a merry-go-round), does the outer edge have the greatest coriolis force or the center have the greatest coriolis force?  I am having a hard time visualizing the difference in terms of greater/lesser effects of coriolis on 2D vs 3D surfaces.",

        "text": "I was recently discussing coriolis with a flat earther (dont laugh).\nI was trying to educate him on what the coriolis actually does in terms of how it affects things on earth.   I think I actually got through to him in terms of making him question his understanding of how coriolis applies to the earth.  In his mind, coriolis would be greatest at the equator and least at the poles, since the tangential velocity is greatest at the equator.  I actually explained this is NOT true, and this can be demonstrated by a Foucault pendulum as there is no precession at the equator, and greater and greater precession as you move further from the equator, with the direction of precession switching between northern and southern hemisphere.   I think I got through to him at least in terms of his mis understanding, (but he still thinks the earth is flat).   My question though, I took the next step of asking him with this new understanding, if you are on a 2 dimensional rotating surface (like a merry go round, as opposed to a sphere), where would the coriolis force be greatest and where would it be least (at the center vs at the outer edge).   I asked this question thinking I knew the answer.   But then I started 2nd guessing myself, so I thought I might try to ask somewhere else and get other opinions on this.   So I will ask this subreddit:  regarding coriolis force as it applies to a rotating 2 dimensional surface (a merry-go-round), does the outer edge have the greatest coriolis force or the center have the greatest coriolis force?  I am having a hard time visualizing the difference in terms of greater/lesser effects of coriolis on 2D vs 3D surfaces.",

        "text": "I have an odd question. I considered asking folks in r/surfing, but I’m looking for a more academic answer. I’ve been trying to figure out the answer to a safety question that feels like physics has the answer. The question: as it relates to blunt force trauma, what is safer: a lower volume, lighter weight, but hard (epoxy fiberglass surfer board); or, a higher volume, heavier, but soft top surfboard. \n\nSome details: the type of blunt force trauma I’m referring to would be an instance where a board would be perpendicular to a breaking wave and would effectively have the full force of the wave propelling the board towards a surfer. For sake of example, let’s say it hits a stationary surfer in the head. \n\nNow, with a higher volume board, contact with the surfer will do little to overcome the force of the wave behind the board, because of the float that the board will have from the wave behind it…but it’s softer, which seems better than harder. \n\nWith the lower volume board, it feels like the surfer will be more able to overcome the float of the board…but it’s a harder surface, which feels worse than soft. \n\nThe harder board is lighter than the soft board. \n\nIn terms of the density, a hard (epoxy fiberglass) board is going to feel like a piece of plywood and a soft board, while it has a foam top, is not really soft and squishy -  they can have wood cores with a thin foam top layer which might feel similar to a fist being covered up by a lightweight boxing glove (they can still do damage). \n\nIn terms of volume, a soft top would be about 8 ft long and 80 liters of volume where an epoxy would by more like 7’6 and 50 liters. \n\nWeight is probably about 12 lbs hard board and 20 lbs soft. \n\nIf I’m basically getting hit by a wave with a hard object eliminating the usual “softness” of water, then does weight matter? Does volume matter? What is meaningful here?",

        "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm not familiar with physics, but I hope I am still eligible to inquire after the physics behind a gravity pump. I asked ChatGPT about the underlying principles, but somehow I didn't feel answered.\n\nMy conversation with ChatGPT:\n\n**Me:** Hello ChatGPT. In simple layman's terms, do I understand the workings of a gravity pump correctly as follows? I once saw a man inserting a tube with a weight on one end in a barrel of water, and water would then come out on the other side of the tube. First of all, should I understand this as a gravity pump? Or at least, I can imagine the mechanisms behind it are the same. I seemed to understand that the water was transported from the barrel to the surface, because of the difference in atmospheric pressure. Is that correct?\n\n**ChatGPT:** Yes, what you described sounds like a basic gravity pump. The weight on the end of the tube creates a difference in pressure between the bottom of the barrel and the surface, which causes water to flow up the tube and out the other end. This is an example of a passive system, as the pump doesn't require any external power source to function. The weight on the end of the tube creates a suction effect which helps to bring the water up.\n\n**Me:** Why is the weight itself important in generating pressure? I assumed it would have more to do with the water itself providing the pressure.\n\n**ChatGPT:** The weight on the end of the tube creates the suction effect by increasing the pressure at the bottom of the tube, which is why the weight is important. When the weight is at the bottom of the tube, it creates a greater force on the water at the bottom of the barrel, which in turn creates a greater pressure difference between the bottom of the barrel and the surface. The greater pressure difference is what causes the water to flow up the tube. The weight is needed to provide the force to create the pressure difference. Without it, the water would not flow.\n\n**Me:** How come the weight increases the pressure?\n\n**ChatGPT:** The weight on the end of the tube creates pressure by exerting a force on the water at the bottom of the barrel. The weight creates a force due to the gravitational pull on it, which is transferred to the water through the tube. When the weight is at the bottom of the tube, the force it exerts on the water is greater than the force exerted on the water by the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the water. This creates a pressure difference between the bottom of the barrel and the surface, which causes the water to flow up the tube.\n\nThe weight on the tube creates a suction effect by increasing the force on the water at the bottom of the barrel, this increase in force creates a greater pressure difference between the bottom of the barrel and the surface, which causes the water to flow up the tube.\n\n**In conclusion:** I couldn't understand, really, why the weight itself would be important in increasing the pressure. On a gut level I can envision an object being submerged in water, and the volume of the water would increase the (atmospheric) pressure. Because there is a difference in atmospheric pressure inside and outside of the barrel, a transfer of water takes place. I doesn't seem to me that the weight itself has anything to do with it. I cannot envision that the gravitational pull of the weight would truly be transferred to the water, especially not \"via the tube.\" That doesn't make sense. Why would the weight not transfer the gravitational pull unto the water directly? ChatGPT seemed illogical here. Then again, I'm not a scholar :-). Please let me know your thoughts; and if possible please explain in layman's terms.\n\nThank you so much!\n\n*SilverC3ll*",

(I’m sorry I couldn’t think of another way to write that to make sense) or would that object need to out put more force/thrust than the black hole at the center of our galaxy.",

I'm not asking from the perspective of somebody who doesn't want to learn the topic but of somebody who, so far, thinks it's overkill.\n\nWhile I find it interesting that, for example, the Lagrangian can be viewed as a function of the tangent bundle of a manifold, I'm not seeing how this helps solve real problems in classical systems.  The examples I've looked at produce the same equations of motion as you get with just a normal Lagrangian approach (or Hamiltonian if that tickles your pickle) where you're not even thinking about manifolds.\n\nSo is this just a purely mathematical exercise or is there some area of classical mechanics where this formalism is demonstrably the best way to go?",
