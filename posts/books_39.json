There good people supporting evil, and very destructive organizations. There are people who carefully plan every move, who are defeated by those who do not. And there is one person who does not plan much at all, who on the spur of the moment acts and saves something very precious.\n\nI am certain that when I read it again, I will discern more from the inner dialogue of certain characters and from the events, and the backdrop of reality in which they occur.",

        "text": "Here’s the essence of the story to the best of my recollection:\n\nOnce upon a time, somewhere in the northern hemisphere, where the winters are brutally harsh, there lived a young girl in a cottage with her father, step mother and two step sisters. Behind the father’s back, the step mother and step sisters treat the girl badly. The step mother wants to get rid of the girl once for all. So she comes up with a plan. She orders the girl in the middle of January, in the dead of the snowy winter to get fresh sunflowers from the meadow for her vase, and tells her strictly not to come home until she finds some. The young girl tries to convince the step mother that sunflowers do not grow in the January cold. But the stepmother doesn’t budge and shoves her out of the house to go get the flowers. Not knowing what to do, the poor girl walks into the forest in the dead of the winter crying. A while later, in the middle of the forest she sees a bonfire in the distance. Upon getting closer, she sees twelve wise men sitting around the bonfire. An old man with a grey beard notices that the girl is shivering in the cold and invites her to join them by the fire. He tells her that his name is January and when it’s his turn to sit at the special spot by the fire, the world gets winter. He then asks the girl what’s she doing alone in the deep forest in the middle of the winter? The girl cries and tells him everything about the step mother and the sunflowers. The old man then points to a youngish looking man seated at a distance and says, “that man is July. When it’s his turn to take the special spot by the fire, the world will have summer and the forest grows sunflowers.” The old man then gets up and summons the young man to take his special spot by the fire. As soon as July sits in the special spot, like magic, the snow melts, and the forest immediately turns green, and plenty of sunflowers appear! The old man tells the girl to pick as many sunflowers as she wants and hurry back home before it’s too late. The girl thanks them, picks some sunflowers and hurries home. \n\nThere’s more to the story of how the step mother learns her lesson, but I think the story so far must have helped ring the bells. Anything anyone?!",

I loved how the story progressed, and each character was given a good amount of space in the book. The plot was something I could have never guessed.\n\nDespite the unpredictable plot and well-developed characters, I found myself struggling to keep up with the large cast of characters.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed reading it, there were a few aspects of the book that left me wanting more:\n\n- I couldn't understand why Dr. Armstrong trusted Justice Wargrave. I mean, they were in a situation where anyone could be a killer, and trusting one person so blindly just didn't sit well with me.\n\n- There were multiple scenes where it was mentioned that everything was going according to the poem, yet everyone ignored it at the right time.\n\n- Also, the partnership between Dr. Armstrong and Justice Wargrave was not even logical. I mean, wouldn't it give the actual murderer a clear signal that something was off? Why didn’t Dr. Armstrong consider this perspective?\n\nI would love to know if anyone has a different perspective or opinion on this.",

All I genuinely remember is there was this neighbor who I’m pretty sure killed them. \n\nThen this one specific scene where the brother was climbing on a tree and like fell and that’s when the reader realized they were dead or something.\n\nThis is a long shot because of my lack of memory but if anyone knows pleaseeeeeee let me know!!",

I always went to the park and sat at a bench to eat with my dog, Kandi. she loved playing fetch and trying to steal some of my food, really a man's best friend. That day a woman interrupted me and Kandi as I was about to throw her ball she told me to leave because I was \"stalking\" her. I was already having a bad day because Kandi pooped on the floor and I had to clean it up, so I asked \"why do you think I'm stalking you?\" She said \"because you followed me all the way from the store to here, you need to stop, NOW.\"  \"ma'am I'm sorry you think that, I was at the store because I do everyday to get some food and I always come here to play with Kandi and eat\" I told her looking kinda annoyed \"WHOS KANDI I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CANT EVEN STALK ONE PERSON AT A TIME! ITS ME OR 'Kandi' OKAY!\" the woman said \"Kandi is my dog and I'm not stalking you ma'am. If I were to stalk someone I like\" I told her, she stomped away angrily, in my head I was thinking \"if I stalked anyone it would be my neighbor Sasha.\" Her making my day even worse, I got up to go to my local coffee shop to wake me up more, thinking I was just overreacting since I was still tired. I got there and the woman was the person in line ahead of me and I didn't realize it until I ordered and went to my table.\n\nChapter two\nHow she ended \n\nShe walked up to me and said \"I'm going to call the police if you keep stalking me okay.\" I was sick and tired of her crap so I got up and left. Thankfully I paid when I ordered and was going to walk in the forest. I loved nature. But like 20 minutes after I got into the forest I heard something behind me. I always kept a weapon on me and when I heard something behind me I attacked whatever was behind me, and I killed it...I killed HER.  I put her in a ditch I always visited, I made it look like an accident, it was anyway. By the time I was done it looked like she fell and died on impact. Apparently she followed me after she saw me at the Cafè. The next day the posters started. It started as a normal day sun was shining,birds were chirping, I was on my way to the park with Kandi when I saw a poster...a missing poster, the woman's name was chasity warbrock. I noticed on the other side of the street was the mayor, he was looking at a missing poster too, he made a phone call and I couldn't hear what he was saying but he looked serious. He hung up and walked away, walking in the direction of his office. It didn't look weird but I had a weird feeling about it.\n\n\nChapter three\nG.O.O\n\nThe day after that I saw something that could make me go crazy. I saw Chastity, she looked normal but I ran as fast as I could, I knew this had something to do with the mayor, it was too crazy she was alive I had a gut feeling that I can't see ghosts so I knew it was not normal to have a dream about killing someone you have never seen before and then see them two days later, plus I saw the posters it can't be that I dreamed it. I decided to go on my forest walk and I noticed something on my way to the forest. \"Was this always there?\" I thought to myself it was a huge building that read \"G.O.O\" under that it read \"government official office\" wow that's cool I was so interested but it looked creepy. Windows were everywhere but they were tiny and tinted as if the people inside were hiding whatever was inside. I was drawn to the building, I was never the type to explore abandoned places or break into places but I wanted to go in. I decided to walk in the forest until 10 o'clock then I went in.\n\nChapter four\nInside G.O.O\n\nTen o'clock rolled around really quickly and I was scared but excited. I walked out of the forest and at that time it was 10:05 PM I walked from the forest to G.O.O By that time it was 10:13 PM all the lights were out and the door was locked. For some reason I didn't give up and found a window that was left unlocked that led to the lobby type area,  I the lights were out and I looked around without the lights to see if I saw any red lights, aka to see if there were cameras, surprisingly there weren't I was confused \"if this is a government building why weren't there cameras\" I thought I found a light switch and it turned on the lobby light there were many more light switches beside the lobby light and I flipped those ones too. I saw something crazy.\n\nChapter five\nA crazy sight\n\nI saw cells, like jail cells. There were people I knew from my best friend who was on vacation right now in them. There were tablet type things on all of them I looked at one of them it read \"clone #486 otherwise known as Charlie lisker\" under that it said \"clone not on use\" the cell beside it was empty it read \"Clone #485 otherwise known as Chris  Jones\" under it read \"Clone in use\" I thought for a second trying to remember where I heard the name then I remembered, Chris is my neighbor! The tablets all had pictures show up for 10 seconds then clone #whatever for 10 seconds. I looked around and I found Chasity's cell empty; her clone was in use. I was both relieved and scared. Relieved because she wasn't back from the dead, but scared if she had some type of technology that she like, sees everything chastity saw before she died even how I killed her. \"I could secretly be a fugitive.\" I thought the word fugitive made me sick to my stomach. While I was deep in thought I heard something, like a door closing, then I heard someone say \"Darik Charleston, how are you? I've missed you.\"\n\nChapter six\nabout G.O.O\n\nI turned around faster than lightning seeing a familiar face, for some reason the lights seemed dim when I needed the lights bright. It was the mayor \"s-sir, Mr Turner, what is this place?\" I asked, my stutter making me look less intimidating \"this place is G.O.O aka government official office, are you curious 593? Oh sorry, Darik.\" He answered. \"593? What do you mea-\" I stopped in my tracks I knew what he meant. He pointed, I could tell he knew why I went silent. I saw he was pointing at a cell, an empty cell. I was staring at it then 4 seconds later, what felt like eternity the screen on the cell changed, showing my face. \"593, sorry I really mean Darik, I know what you wondering, you have a question.\" He said \"which one, Turner, which question.\" I asked, sweat dripping from my face as I was questioning my life. \"Darik, your the first one to turn into a criminal, let me rephrase, the first one I haven't killed, no, that I'm not going to kill.\" Mr Turner said, scaring me with his tone. \"What do you mean, why aren't there any cameras?\" I asked, he answered pretty quickly \"because you're my son, we can't have any of this recorded, and I made someone to be yours that is in love with you, that I know you're also in love with, Sasha Jones.\" I then saw her cell empty, her clone was in use. My \"father\" then said \"she will talk to you tomorrow if you're at the right place and ask you to go out with her. It's your choice. Do you want a normal life Darik?  This is all so more people come to this town, we have the least amount of missing cases unsolved, aren't you gonna go home hon?\"\n\nChapter seven\nA choice\n\nI went home that night deep in thought, I loved Sasha and decided to do my normal routine. And the next day at the park Sasha was there and asked me for my number, I said yes of course and we texted all night. We planned a date and went to my place, watched a movie, took Kandi to go potty, kissed, made dinner, and did unspeakable things that night.\n\nTHE END",

        "text": "For some reason, I thought the author of 1984 and Animal Farm grew up in the upper class of society. Well he did not, in fact he was broke as an adult; dead ass broke on the verge of homelessness. Down and Out chronicles his time in Paris as he works at a restaurant for low wages and sleeps in a dilapidated apartment. This is the early 20th century and labor laws were a joke; 12 to 18 hour work days, 7 times a week. And if that wasn't bad enough you see the hygiene protocols for the handling of food; as in there were none, i would have rather eaten something from Fear Factor than what they served in those restaurants after one's dirty hands and lips touched the food until it finally made its way to the customer's table. \n\nThere is a cast of colorful characters Orwell meets, and they all have different personalities and views on how to view life; from the philosopher street artist finding pride in his work despite his rag clothes to the bitter and resentful tramp who belittles his fellow tramps as parasites on society (but not him, he's just down on his luck is all).\n\nWe do get a few pages of George musing on why poverty exists and why society hates the poor so much. It is not a book he delves too deep in these ideas but he does tickle your brain about the socioeconomic conditions of Paris and London. Simply put, he had a rough road",

        "text": "\\- Well, I just wrapped up Ray Bradbury's first major work of science fiction, and I guess I'll have to find something to do with myself. As I understand it, this is the book that really launched Bradbury's popularity, and I can easily understand why. The Martian Chronicles certainly wasn't what I expected, in a good way. Instead of any sort of standard creation with stories linking one to the next to advance the overall plot, you are led to meander through different tales vaguely hinting at some overarching themes. It had slight I, Robot vibes, which was great as I loved that book too.\n\n\\-Ray Bradbury cites Jules Verne and H.G. Wells as writers he took a lot of inspiration from, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs and the John Carter of Mars series. Those influences are absolutely felt reading The Martian Chronicles, as bizarre, almost Twilight Zone-like events play out on wonderfully written Martian landscapes. This is a fun read full of exploration, nuanced characters, and two galactic races meeting and failing to coexist. \n\n\\-As with most readers, I've read Fahrenheit 451 and always found Bradbury's insight into future technology well met. In The Martian Chronicles he writes of devices that resemble Amazon Alexa, iPhone watches, Ring and so on. All in 1950. Maybe it wasn't so far fetched to imagine these futuristic devices as Americans had seen the auto industry, the weapons industry, the aircraft and rocket industry all begin to boom. Still Bradbury deserves a ton of credit for being fairly accurate.\n\n***“Ask me, then, if I believe in the spirit of the things as they were used, and I’ll say yes. They’re all here. All the things which had uses. All the mountains which had names. And we’ll never be able to use them without feeling uncomfortable. And somehow the mountains will never sound right to us; we’ll give them new names, but the old names are there, somewhere in time, and the mountains were shaped and seen under those names. The names we’ll give to the canals and mountains and cities will fall like so much water on the back of a mallard. No matter how we touch Mars, we’ll never touch it. And then we’ll get mad at it, and you know what we’ll do? We’ll rip it up, rip the skin off, and change it to fit ourselves.”*** \n\n\\- In general, The Martian Chronicles follows a plot centered around humans finally developing the technology to make it to Mars, and how an expedition to Mars would likely go should the planet have ever proved habitable. Think of this as a cosmic version of the Christopher Columbus story. Humans arrive on Mars with semi-good intentions, and after several failed attempts to interact and coexist with Martians, they finally infest and overtake the Red Planet like earlier European settlers to the New World. Most of the Martian race even ends up dying out due to sickness and disease (chickenpox ironically) that humans once again inadvertently bring.  And, I have no doubt this would actually happen if we did truly find another habitable planet. We are a living plague.\n\n\\- There are tales here that could be an Episode of Rick &amp; Morty, as with the Second Expedition being placed in a Martian lunatic asylum. There are also Chronicles here that are filled with original horror, as with one expedition which lands on Mars seemingly inhabited by the crew's dead relatives. Ray Bradbury shows a great mastery here in the range of tone he is able to write out. He can strike terror, he can be funny, and he can be powerful. It is all on display here in The Martian Chronicles.\n\n ***“Garrett,\" said Stendahl, \"do you know why I've done this to you? Because you burned Mr. Poe's books without really reading them. You took other people's advice that they needed burning. Otherwise you'd have realized what I was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago. Ignorance is fatal, Mr. Garrett.”*** \n\n\\-Here too we have mentions of occurrences that any reader could see would one day influence Fahrenheit 451. Censorship is prevalent in the background, on the goings-on of Earth. Freedoms are being limited, and people are moving to Mars to escape the increasingly totalitarian governments of Earth practicing mass book burnings . There are accompanying tales that are pretty interesting in regards to this, such as \"Usher II\" which the above quote is from. \"Usher II\", without giving away the story, draws much from Edgar Allan Poe and Earth's censory of the great writers. This must have been one of Bradbury's fears that actually has yet to come true, as it is obviously referenced again quite heavily in his later classic.\n\n***“Not until the good Lord is. Oh, don’t look so terribly shocked, please. The Lord is not serious. In fact, it is a little hard to know just what else He is except loving. And love has to do with humor, doesn’t it? For you cannot love someone unless you put up with him, can you? And you cannot put up with someone constantly unless you can laugh at him. Isn’t that true? And certainly we are ridiculous little animals wallowing in the fudge bowl, and God must love us all the more because we appeal to his humor.”***\n\n***\"There was Earth and there the coming war, and there hundreds of thousands of mothers or grandmothers or fathers or brothers or aunts or uncles or cousins. They stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of Earth, much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of Mars; it was a problem reversed. To all intents and purposes, Earth now was dead; they had been away from it for three or four years. Space was an anesthetic; seventy million miles of space numbed you, put memory to sleep, depopulated Earth, erased the past, and allowed these people here to go on with their work. But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other’s faces. At nine o’clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn. The people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out. They waited.\"***\n\n\\-Conflict amongst man and Martian eventually turns to conflict amongst man and himself. An atomic war erupts between the totalitarian governments of Earth, and the citizens of Mars are left to contemplate staying, or returning to Earth to fight or aid their home countries. Being published in 1950, fresh off the meat grinder of World War II, this had to be a fear that routinely played in everyone's minds. Bradbury is working that fear here, as he did in later works as well with the Cold War looming. It's funny how the threat of atomic war doesn't hit as hard to today's readers (though maybe it should), yet in the 50's and 60's these themes likely wrought fear and dread over fresh memories of war. We really aren't that far removed from these times either, just that we exist in such a different, more comfortable generation that sees atomic war as a relic of the past. \n\n\\-I had several comments on a few of the tales. I really wished one of the stories returned to the scene of the Third Expedition, because what the actual fuck. \"Way In The Middle Air\" was sobering in that it forces you to realize Jim Crow laws, segregation and slavery wasn't all that long ago. I consider Bradbury a more contemporary writer, so reading this tale initially felt out of place...like was this supposed to take place just after the Civil War? But then I remember Bradbury was writing in the 40's and 50's where the South was still an awful place to be black, and Civil Rights Movements had only just began, and there was still segregation and lynchings...and, we REALLY ARE NOT THAT FAR REMOVED FROM THOSE TIMES EITHER.\n\n\\-Ugly what human greed did to The Martian. Yuck.\n\n\\-Let me know your favorite tales from this book. I wholeheartedly enjoyed The Silent Towns (major LOL), The Off Season, The Martian, The Earth Men, and The Third Expedition either because these stories were hilarious or horrible. Let me know what you thought!\n\n ***“The Martians were there—in the canal—reflected in the water.... The Martians stared back up at them for a long, long silent time from the rippling water....”***",

The successes and stumbles and the unimaginable cruelty.  The economic fights of laborers both black and white, the questions of land ownership, and the right to vote and hold office.  Nothing less than true democracy is at stake. He puts the economic questions in socialist terms and it is really hard to argue that given the enslavement of millions that a break from at all times wasn’t called for. A reset.  A reset rather than implementing a new system.  Du Bois sees a lot of good that came from Reconstruction.  If it had been continued instead of rejected in the most harmful manner imaginable he sees the world as being a very different place.  A world war averted.  Skin tone based oppression viewed in a different light.  It is hard to argue his points.\n\nOne of the best and most important history books I’ve read, and for what it’s worth I’ve read a few hundred. \n\nI plan to read Eric Foner’s book on Reconstruction later this year to compare and to see how scholarship views things decades after Du Bois’ masterpiece.",

I'm just a badly organized person and usually forget about books I take out as I'm focused on work or other things. I'm planning to go back tomorrow to hand them back but I'm a bit worried about the fine I'm going to get. I'm sure my library does a 50p per week policy. It's been a few months now so I'm just a bit wary about how much I'll have to pay. Surely since each book would be worth at most £10 it would be £20 at most to pay. I'll pay the fine but I'm hopeful it'll be reasonable. Anyone had any big fines from the library before?\n\nI do feel guilty for being in possession of their books for so long and exceeding the time but I'm hoping they won't ban me from the library. \n\nI'm thinking of just borrowing e books from the library so it automatically removes them from my device after the borrow period is over. Though I just went to try and it says my membership has been cancelled. \n\nI'm not looking forward to handing these books back, I'm just hopeful that I'll be able to borrow e books.",

It’s a five ⭐️ book in my opinion.\n\nThe main reason I liked it is because of the theme of the book - which is two friends that create video games together. However there are two things that kind of bothered me about it. I’ll focus on these since it’s already gotten many rave reviews:\n\n1) On Metal Gear Solid\n\nI was an avid player of Metal Gear Solid. The video game, and creator Hideo Kojima, gets a solid shout out early on in the book. I was ecstatic when this unfolded. \n\nZevin gets it right that the purpose of the game was to avoid fighting as much as possible, avoid war. But then she describes the game as “boring.” Which is not how I would have thought to describe the game. I would maybe say frustrating, in terms of its hard to figure out. \n\nIn my opinion it speaks to the difference between a gamer and a non gamer.\n\nI also find it strange she chose this adjective for this game, given that there is a chapter devoted to the exact opposite (no spoilers).\n\nAdditionally she hates on Madden Football pretty hard? \n\n2) On the Illiad\n\nShe ruins the ending to The Illiad and completely spoils how it ends for one character. I want to read both The Odyssey and The Illiad and when I got to this part I was like… come on….\n\nIt’s a great book, but often times it checks the same checkbox each and every time.",

        "text": "I've been reading the thread about how fast people read, and I am really kind of perplexed by all the answers. Seems like everyone is reading 50-100 pages per hour. For me, to be honest, that's insane.\n\nI don't mean to offend anyone, but I really don't understand it.\n\nI read 10-25 pages per hour, depends on the font size, page size, and difficulty of material.\n\nCurrently I'm reading War and Peace (started in June 2022, and going slowly, on and off).\n\nI'm currently on around 1320th page (the total page count of this edition is around 1920 pages).\n\nMy average speed for this type of material is around 15 pages per hour.\n\nI do have some difficulties with concentration, and sometimes some intrusive thoughts, or sometimes I go back to make sure I understand what I read... But even without these difficulties, I wouldn't be much faster. Perhaps instead of 15 pages per hour, I'd read 20 or 22 pages per hour of such type of material.\n\nBut that's it, can't go much faster than that. (I mean I could, but that would be unnatural and artificial pace for me, **and I wouldn't feel that I am truly present with the characters in all the situations that are described in the book)**\n\n15 pages feel normal.\n\nSo I can't understand how on Earth people read 100 pages an hour? What kind of reading is that?\n\nPerhaps it's different format of pages? Very easy material? Large font size... But even all these factors can't explain it fully to me.\n\nWhen I read, I read roughly at the same pace as when I'm talking.\n\nSometimes even slower, because when I talk, I know exactly what I'm talking about. And when I read a classic like War and Peace, there is always new stuff, footnotes explaining French, some rarely used words, introduction of new characters and situations. So I read with the pace in which I can understand it all.\n\nAnd I don't skip anything. I read the whole thing, every single word until I understand it.\n\n15 pages doesn't seem slow to me. It seems normal.\n\nIf I read just 1 hour a day, with this pace, that would be 15x365 = 5475 pages a year, which is a lot!\n\nIt's 18 typical 300 pages books. For me that is completely fine and enough.\n\nI don't have problems with my speed. I only wish I was more consistent and read each day for an hour.\n\nIn a year I could read tons of stuff... and thoroughly and with full understanding. With just 1 hours a day, at 15 pages per hour. For easier stuff, I could go even at 20-25 pages per hour, which would bring me to whopping 7300 to 9125 pages per year.\n\nBut even my conservative estimate of 18 books at 15 pages/hour is completely fine.",

        "text": "My two most recently finished novels have a surprising amount of interplay, and both were deeply thought provoking. I just finished A Cosmology of Monsters, by Shaun Hamill, and before that, The Pallbearer's Club, by Paul Tremblay.\n\nUp top, initial reviews, The Pallbearer's Club is a remarkable slow burn and blew me away within the first two pages where the narrative device that would frame the rest of the novel is introduced. Despite the lack of real things happening in the story, it was gripping to watch a man confront his life, and the ending was shocking with it's lack of twist, save for the very last paragraph. 9/10, no notes.\n\nA Cosmology of Monsters has an equally gripping start; I suspect that the first sentence (I started collecting my elder sister Eunice's suicide letters when I was seven) will live in my mind for a while. It leaned harder into the supernatural elements than TPC ever did; monsters, as it turns out, were real, and also maybe the friends we made along the way. I will reserve giving it a numbered grade though.\n\nThe notable similarity between both novels is that they aren't presented as such. Both are memoirs; the author and main character are synonymous, recounting their tragic lives and eventually explaining the mystery of why write the book in the first place. Both have a supernatural twist, TPC's the subtle New England horror of witchcraft and vampirism, ACoM's a dramatic and lovecraftian horror, evocative of his dream cycle.\n\nI would say that a defining shared similarity is that the true monster, more-so than any 400 year old vampire or flying wolf creature, is undiagnosed mental illness. TPC leaves in question whether or not there even is a true supernatural element, or just two unreliable narrators bickering at each other. ACoM decides instead to have it's cake and eat it too; there are real monsters, real monsters that feed into and off of despair and mental illness. Amusingly enough, this plays better into the mystery of TPC; it's genuinely unknown exactly how real it all is, making the non-twisting twist ending hit harder. For as spooky as the dreamlike nameless city is in ACoM, it does at least explain a lot, and that makes the unknowns a lot more satisfying. For as much as ACoM talks about no happy endings, merely satisfying stopping points, it's ending is as about as happy as could be had in such a novel.\n\nMaybe I'm bitter about it, though. Art Barbara was never as relatable to me as Noah Turner. This is why I didn't give ACoM a silly rating. For a brief window in the middle of the book, I saw myself in Noah Turner, and was certain that the monster was going to be instead a metaphor for queer sexuality. I thought Noah was an autistic gay furry, was positive in my heart and soul that he and the masculine-coded wolf monster would smooch, to the point I was blind-sided by the monster transforming back into a woman. Any subtext I thought I had read into it was promptly dropped. Looking back, I don't know what was intentional, and with how definitively the book states it's metaphor right at the end, it's not really trying to be queer. I still can't help but feel lied to, and I don't know if that's me, or the book.\n\nThis has quickly become a collection of thoughts. I'll move on to some non-fiction and write about something more queer later.",

Maybe (?) glue some Polaroids in it. But it would be cool if it's of the right quality, so we can pass it on to our children, and then their children, and then their children. And so on.\n\nAny idea where would could buy something like that, or what materials it would be made from? 100's or even 1000 years.",

Sure, it oversimplified the story and the costumes seemed far from accurate but if treated as some kind of a parody or just a comedy, I think it’s a pretty fun movie and the casting was good. Are there any other Jane Austen fans who think the same?\n\nIt’s just another time something like this happens. People were hating on the Netflix’s Watership Down adaptation, while I loved it. Tolkien fans were treating The Hobbit trilogy like some kind of a heresy, I liked it more than the original trilogy. I’m really beginning to doubt my taste in movie adaptations.\n\nAre there any adaptations of your beloved books that you love despite them being shunned by the community?",

I enjoyed the flow of the plot and found the ties between the South Pacific and the Irish interesting. The characters and plot are very straightforward but creative nonetheless. I found the explanation for the backstory of the underworld and the Moon Pool a bit rushed and underwhelming. I think I enjoyed the first few chapters the best. Although the last chapter wraps of the story nicely and gives a fulfilling end. Overall I’d give it a 7.8/10 - not a bad sci fi but not entirely gripping either.",

True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that﻿—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.\n\nReally appreciate ant input.
