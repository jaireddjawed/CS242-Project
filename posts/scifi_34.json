As a history buff I love the hints at gender swapped Philipp II and Alexander the Great in Space with Eirene and her daughter Sun with the mother this embodiment of hot headed, toxic, full of herself, hedonistic but competent military leader and Sun trying to prove herself.\n\nOn the other hand alot of weird modern antics with the companions each ruler and heir has around them kinda more a weird mix of military and political support and idol band.\n\nStill, the world building of completely alien human civilizations (four armed humans rule the Phene Empire being stand ins for Persia and a more into cybernetic enhancement, decadent other group standing in for Greeks) works rather well in implying centuries over centuries of space faring human civilization in a nook of the galaxy.\n\nThat said, it is having a richer world and unique ideas than most military SF out there these days.",

        "text": "Made this a few months back, just some background details on weapons I don‚Äôt plan to info dump, but just have as world building to come up over time. Thoughts on how they sound? \n\n\nSolid Fuel Weapons:\nSolid fuel weapons are the most common weapons across standardized armies in the known galaxy. They are not to be confused with round-fire weapons, those archaic weapons with solid shot and fuel incorporated into a cartridge. \nModern solid fuel weapons consist of three main components; Solid fuel is the term used for a variety of block substances synthysized on manufactory worlds. The chemical makeup of these fuel blocks determines many characteristics of the shot, such as increasing heat for anti-armor, stopping power, and dispersion (range). Highly volatile, the solid substance is stored in metal containers which feed into the weapon. Whenever a shot is fired, a razor sharp metal divider will separate the pre-designated amount of the ammunition from the block, before a primer is deployed within this chamber. The volatile chemical mixture will ignite, expanding, and charging the particles within. After a momentary concentration period, the chamber will open to the barrel and the charge will be released. \nThe second component is the power pack. Whereas the solid fuel is used as ammunition, the power pack is an auxilliary power source, the importance of which depends on the weapon being used. The power pack provides energy for the initial primer charge, as well as injecting electricity into the hyper-charged particles in the combustion chamber before release, adding to the heat and stopping power of the shot. The power pack also provides power for any attachments or extra functions of a weapon. Usually it can last through an entire engagement, however in intense fighting may take several replacements. \nThe final component, essential to the makeup of a solid fuel weapon, is the compression, concentration, and direction (CCD) element. This is the device affixed near to the end of the barrel of a weapon which takes the hyper-charged particles and forms them into a neat shape, which it then directs outwards at the designed shap, size, and concentration, all of which contribute to the weapons range, stopping power, heat damage, and other factors. The solid fuel weapon is very loud, and has a varying delay in firing due to the seperation, ignition, concentration, and CCD processes.  \n\nGaseous Fuel Weapons:\n    Gaseous fuel weapons are generally used by professional aspects of a well-equipped army, or by the elites of a smaller army. The fuel used in these weapons comes from heavily ionized gasses, which are costly and dangerous to manufacture, and which cannot be compressed any further, making it possible to carry far less ammunition than could be carried for a solid fuel weapon. In the process of firing, gas is injected directly from the canister and is ignited by a spark-plug, which is then released directly out of the barrel. \n    A benefit of gaseous fuel weapons is that the power of the shot can be adjusted on the go, as well as the fact that they are nearly silent, since they do not have to go through the CCD element, leaving which causes a massive amount of noise. The shot is generally much faster than the solid fuel weapons, with no delay and more concentrated particles. The ionized gas is generally of a much higher quality than the solid fuel, provided a more powerful round. With few extra moving parts, the gaseous fuel weapons can withstand far more abuse and wear and tear than the many complex mechanisms inside of most solid fuel weapons. \n\nHelio Fuel Weapons: \nThe most powerful of any weapons in their class, helio weapons utilize Helio energy, extracted from the hearts of stars in solar systems. They are used only by the most elite units in an advanced army, and by many larger spacecraft. The same substance drives the transition boosters on any interstellar capable spacecraft. \n    A helio-weapon utilizes a specialty crystal glass canister of the substance, required as most metals and other substances that could be mass produced would melt under the extreme heat. The canisters glow a bright orange to yellow to red, depending on the star they were extracted from, each with slightly different purities and properties. \nThese canisters are loaded directly into the weapons firing chamber, and are activated by a simple physical mechanism which opens one end of the canister. The helio fuel immediately escapes the canister, emptying into the fire chamber, and funnels through a special-made CCD element designed for the intense heat, or simply straight through the fire chamber, through the barrel, and out in an uncontrolled explosive blast. \n    These types of weapons are by far the most powerful and expensive, and have immense heat and energy potential, even a small weapon being able to blast holes in structures and people alike.",

At this point how will that affect America's stance on the war?\n\nYou have wiped out 99.9% of the imperial Japanese army, navy &amp; air force due to your strength being far superior to them, so there was no consideration on dropping the bombs on both Nagasaki &amp; Hiroshima as you've helped the allies so much, they're beyond stunned of your superior strength, stamina and agility. What would both cities look like today in this case?\n\nYou've provided the allied forces very valuable Intel that even commanders from both the friendly or enemy forces are oblivious to, such as:\n\n* Locations, dates or times of upcoming battles or offensives\n* Providing a detailed list of POW camps w/map including names of prisoners &amp; guards\n* Position of all enemy units\n* Full legal names all enemy troops, officers including their relatives\n* Personal information of the enemy such as their home address, banking info, citizenship &amp; etc.\n* Allocated units soldiers are assigned\n* Names of victims of the holocaust, locations of the camps they're imprisoned in\n* Names and personal details of all the perpetrators of such atrocities\n* Detailed photographic evidence of war crimes committed by the enemies (before they even had the chance)\n\nYou have also provided them the state-of-the-art medical equipment / medication as it so far advanced for this era that instantly cures them from their ailments or wounds. You are armed and equipped with the following from the very distant future:\n\n* Drones (with super advanced sensors, 8K night vision &amp; infrared, top-notch AI)\n* Rifles that do not require any ammunition, instead shoot out highly powerful rays / lasers\n* Exo-skeleton suit that enables you to jump at great distances even teleport\n* Eye contacts with embedded infrared / night vision\n* Detailed holographic map of the terrain retold from recorded maps of this era with key Intel of the positions of the enemies (Nazis, Ottomans, Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy, etc.)\n\nSensors are installed on your iPad-like device to detect enemy presence, you can instantly look up their current position and gather their coordinates, which also collects their data such as blood type, medical history, unit affiliation, full name, superior officer, next of kin, residential address, country of allegiance, names of comrades, weapon they're equipped with.\n\nHow would both the Ottomans or axis powers be able to put up with your presence as your arsenals outmatch them, how would your presence change the overall outcome of both world wars and how history books will recall it?",

        "text": "# \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5xcxgkl20y7a1.gif\n\n# Humans are Weird ‚Äì Gnawing\n\nOriginal Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-gnawing](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-gnawing)\n\nAbove the canopy of the deep summer-gourd orchard the air grew hotter as the rays of sunlight fell nearly directly down the planet‚Äôs gravity well.  With each layer of emerald green leave the light diffused and the temperature dropped until the open forest floor where even the impressively endothermic humans found the temperature cool, if the light dim.\n\nNotes the Passing Changes had been tremendously busy for weeks in the spring, setting up monitoring nodes, distributing nutrients as he saw fit, and trying to integrate the other species‚Äô needs into the overall plans as well. Of course the great orchard needed very little attention by this point. The Gathering had been nurturing it for tree generations and it now was mature enough to make it‚Äôs own decisions most of the time. However the younger orchards the humans had planted, the Shatar gardens, and the ever disturbed pathways and road needed constant attention as the seasons changed, but now even those had slowed down. The summer crop plants were progressing with only minor losses to predators. The autumn crop plants were singing out their pheromones to summon pollinators and the flitting creatures responded eagerly. All the fibers led to the conclusions that Notes the Passing Changes could ease down a bit and rest, perhaps only tending to lower priority issues, such as making sure the summer-gourd orchard was producing enough fruits.\n\nNearly three days ago Notes the Passing Changes had begun sending more mass into the thin duff that covered the  bed of the deep orchard, being sure to focus any tender tendrils in the fallen logs and branches and the soil just under them. Before all of the companion species had arrived Notes the Passing Changes would have simply evenly distributed awareness throughout the bed of rich detritus, but the reptilian folk dug long shallow trenches with their dragging tails and the pounding feet of the humans somehow never managed to say on the paths. In the end there had been no point in trying to contain them. Mindfully arranging tendrils in safe little micro climates was a far easier process and the summer-gourd orchard came into focus.\n\nIt was a popular place when the sunbeams angled straight down. The tripping sound of little feet announced the presence of a rather large cluster of Shatar cousins scampering about from tree to tree, pausing at one, and then hurrying on to another. Notes the Passing Changes vaguely recalled that a local First Father had requested permission to send an educational group out to collect immature specimens for some learning project or another. Near the center of the orchard, where the progenitor tree had once stood and which was now a soft and level surface a group of humans seemed to be actively disturbing as much of the duff as they could. Two clusters of humans would suddenly charge each other, colliding like cloud masses, struggling for a bit, and then falling back apart. Occasionally an odd oblong shape they collectively held would thump to the ground. Occasionally a human would run into a tree.\n\nNotes the Passing Changes focused attention on the signals from the trees.  They felt not distress at the collisions and were quite stimulated by the excess carbon dioxide and the incidental surprise nitrogen deposits. There were a few older trees that would soon cull themselves, but they would probably last a few more seasons.  About half of the trees were actively producing fruit while the other half rested this season. All told it was well within expectations and Notes the Passing Changes let attention diffuse and began looking for a change to interact with one of the neighbors. The Shatar young ones were entirely focused on what their elder sister was saying. The scrimmaging group of humans did consist of several the Gathering knew, including Notes the Passing Changes‚Äôs particular friend Pat,  but they were quite focused on whatever they were doing. There were many individual humans scattered throughout the orchard but most of them were dormant with the temperature this high and the sunlight at this angle. However there was one human who was quite active, though she was sitting on one of the logs Notes the Passing Changes was diffused into.\n\nThe human female was within sight of the scrimmaging group as far as Notes the Passing Changes could tell but she wasn‚Äôt looking at them. She had a physical data storage device laying on the surface her bent legs made as she sat. Her eyes were running over the inscriptions on the surface and her lips moved slowly though she was not producing any vocal sounds. As Notes the Passing Changes observed one of her hands drifted down and began groping around the log. She then turned her attention to the surface and frowned as she began prodding at the log in a more purposeful way. Notes the Passing Changes assumed she was looking for the writing stylus that was sitting beside her on the log. She most likely couldn‚Äôt see it because of the dim level of light so far beneath the canopy. The Gathering extended a thickened tendril and lifted the stylus up.\n\n‚ÄúSandy-‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes began.\n\nSandy started and gave a small gasp.\n\n‚ÄúI am quite sorry,‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes said to the woman who was breathing heavily now. ‚ÄúI did not mean to startle you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYe didnae,‚Äù she said, with a grin. ‚ÄúNae pure anyhow.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen why is your language reverting to your native dialect?‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes asked, rotating the stylus in a tendril, feeling the pitted surface.\n\nSandy blinked down at the tendril for several moments and then burst into laughter.\n\n‚ÄúGo dook yourself!‚Äù she said.\n\nSandy then drew in a great lungful of air and smiled down at the bed of the forest. When she spoke her voice had reverted to the usual tones of a trained Survey Core Ranger.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe you did startle me a little,‚Äù she confessed, ‚Äúbut the occasional startle is good for the soul. Thanks for finding my scribbler. It‚Äôs dark down here.‚Äù\n\nShe held out her hand and Notes the Passing Changes placed the stylus in her palm.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do the markings on your, scribbler, indicate?‚Äù the Gathering asked.\n\nShe glanced at it and frowned.\n\n‚ÄúWhat markings?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúThe deep groves near the end,‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes said.\n\nSandy ran her thumb over the groves and her face broke out in a grin.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just where I chew on it while I‚Äôm editing,‚Äù she explained.\n\n‚ÄúWhat nutrients do you extract from the stylus?‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes asked, growing more interested.\n\n‚ÄúNae a bit,‚Äù the human replied with a laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something I do, helps me focus.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow does chewing on the stylus do that?‚Äù Notes the Passing Changes asked.\n\nSandy stared down at the forest bed for a long moment and then heaved a massive sigh.\n\n‚ÄúA dinnae ken,‚Äù she finally said. ‚ÄúA jus dinnae ken.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Please go leave a review on my 3rd book \"Humasn are Weird: Let's Work it Out\"\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r9kbwak50y7a1.gif",

        "text": "\"Billion years ago, Mars was a world teeming with life. Its surface was dotted with shallow, crystal clear pools of water, fed by a network of underground aquifers that flowed beneath the planet's surface. These pools were home to a diverse array of life forms, including long, sinuous creatures with shimmering, iridescent scales and delicate, transparent fins.\n\nOther creatures roamed the grassy plains and tangled forests that covered much of the planet's surface. There were four-legged beasts with thick, fur-like coats and sharp, needle-like teeth, as well as nimble, tree-dwelling creatures with shimmering wings and razor-sharp claws.\n\nBut it was not just the animals that thrived on Mars. The planet's air was filled with a rich variety of plant life, including towering trees with gnarled, twisted branches and delicate, lace-like leaves. There were also vines and creeping plants that covered the ground, their colorful flowers attracting a host of pollinating insects and small animals.\n\nDespite the abundance of life on Mars, the planet was not without its challenges. The thin atmosphere and intense solar radiation made life difficult for many of the planet's inhabitants, and only the hardiest and most adaptable species were able to survive.\n\nOver time, these creatures evolved to better suit their environment. Some developed thick, armored skin to protect themselves from the harsh winds and abrasive sands, while others developed the ability to photosynthesize, using the dim red light of the sun to fuel their bodies.\n\nBut even these adaptations were not enough to save all of Mars's life forms. As the planet cooled and its atmosphere thinned, many species went extinct, unable to withstand the increasingly hostile conditions.\n\nDespite these setbacks, life on Mars continued to evolve and adapt. And as the eons passed, the planet gave rise to a multitude of strange and wondrous life forms, each one more bizarre and alien than the last.\n\nToday, Mars is a barren, inhospitable world, its once-lush landscape reduced to a rocky, dusty desert. But the evidence of its past life remains, etched into the planet's surface and preserved in the fossilized remains of its ancient inhabitants. And as humans begin to explore the Red Planet, they can't help but wonder what other secrets it holds, and what strange and wondrous life forms they might encounter as they delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.\"\n\nWritten by OpenAI.",

        "text": " \n\nEntropy is defined as the amount of configurations a system can have. During the infancy of the universe, all particles were spread out and atoms did not form to create molecules yet. Atoms that form an apple for example is one of the particular states those atoms could have. If the atoms were rearranged so that something else was formed, the apple would not exist physically, but it could, given the atoms are arranged appropriately. Objects that consist of atoms depend on those atoms to be in a certain state to physically exist, so in one possible state the apple exists, but in another, it doesn't. Likewise, all matter is composed of these atoms. Roads, air, you and me.. Since the universe has high entropy, it has a lot of states that atoms and other particles could have arranged themselves in, and therefor form different objects, and people. Changing the state of an object doesn't mean that state is gone forever. Cream can un-mix from coffee for example, it's just statistically highly improbable.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is: Since certain macroscopic objects exist due to the state of the particles they consist of, and you can change a state, but not destroy it, is it possible that even though our current universe is already in a particular state, is it possible that the state where the moon never formed due to the atoms that it consist of not arranging exists as a possible state as well, inducing a similar, but not the same universe?
