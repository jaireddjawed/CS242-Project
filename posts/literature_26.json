        "text": "Hey all,\n\nSo I am just a guy who just heard \"about\" the illustrious Homer my entire reading life, and only now took the time to steadily read, and complete, the Iliad in english. Took me about a month or 2, but I consistently worked at it. I'm decently good at reading at this point. If I don't understand something at first, or I notice my attention has flagged, I will take a break and come back to it until I feel I have a grasp and then continue on.\n\nSo I've heard all these amazing things about Homer, usually through reading what other great thinkers thought about him (Nietzsche, Goethe specifically) and I have to say I did not enjoy what I read. I never felt entertained. I never even really felt nourished or invigorated. It wasn't even a difficult book. It felt like a flat pastiche of action scenes, with smatterings of emotion pasted on. It didn't feel \"deep,\" which may be another word for exploring subtle psychological dimensions (like war and peace, Ulysses, or Dost.), but I am wondering if that's because epic poetry has a different intent. I am used to reading novels, and feel they give me that gripping feeling.\n\nSo I felt different every time I picked up the book, and didn't take my first thought or feeling for granted, but a few ideas consistently stuck with me. I'm not an anime fan, but a lot of the scenes felt like they were in an anime format: with the long speeches of bravado taking place in this mysterious place of stillness, right in the middle of an intense battle scene, where a character explains what they are thinking and feeling in a monologue, and it's all very exaggerated and heavily applied, and then the action is wrapped up very quickly.\n\nWhich was great, btw. The vivid descriptions of violence were always fun. And sometimes the language was breathtakingly beautiful...the adjectives that were used were very colorful and bright, and the originality of the language capturing a picturesque scene for a metaphor was something I was constantly struck by. Refreshing is what I'd like to say. And the inclusion of nature into use for grand metaphors may have been a part of this. The refreshing language is what kept me coming back and reading with anticipation each time I re-picked up the book.\n\nAlso, the tension and set-up until the release of Achilles on the battlefield was striking. It was  80% build up, with a myriad of heroes rising and falling, and stealing the show for a few hundred lines, and then being eclipsed by yet another larger-than-life hero. And I thought this was beautifully interwoven and put together, with another variation among each interaction, to build the anticipation of \"oh my god, if this dude can do THIS and he's terrified of Achilles, wait until Achilles shows up, what's he going to do?\" \n\nBut the countless names and short biographies of all these actors got super tiresome and tedious, and I didn't bother to try and stick them to memory. Was an audience expected to keep these names in mind? So when someone died it didn't mean much to me.\n\nThat's a thing, too. The deaths of people didn't mean anything to me. The tremendous amounts of woe and sorrow that the characters express for eachother is readily on the page, but none of that touched me. Again, unlike my experience when reading a novel where I grow attached to characters and feel something when something happens to them. \n\nOn a side note: I always heard that Patroklus and Achilles were gay lovers. I read the story pretty closely, and I found zero indications of this. In fact, it was quite clearly stated they were brought up young together and were like brothers. Achilles extreme lamentation over his dear friend's death is wholly fitting without the \"gay\" theme. \n\nSo the story I thought had an original, bold story arc. To build up the tension tightly over hundreds of small scenes, to build anticipation for the release of Achilles on the battlefield, who proceeds to dash around the battlefield like a sunbeam, I thought was very cool.\n\nThe language was colorful, bright, and refreshing. An adjective never felt misplaced or forced. Excellent stuff.\n\nBut the characters and the action in general I developed no emotional attachment for. And if this is the case, why has this story persisted through countless generations as something that is read? And is the emotional attachment actually something I shouldn't have anticipated? Is this just not a feature or goal of epic poetry? Is this where the importance of culture and literature can be discussed?\n\nAs for wisdom and intellectual nourishment, I felt it was okay. The hyperbole surrounding the ancient Greeks, (for thousands of years this was an educational text for the upper class Greeks to use, like their bible), and especially Nietzsche speaking about the intellectual vitality and vigor of the pre-socratic Greeks, built up some anticipation in this regard, too. But I just saw it as a warrior culture, with a flat philosophy, not much different than the multiple other warrior cultures from the bronze age. I didn't derive much inspiration from it in this regard. \n\nThanks for your time if you read this. I will probably not read again, nor especially recommend others read it also. But glad I took the time to read a bedrock of western literature. Thanks!",

        "text": "*Spoiler alert* (duh)\n\nI just finished reading Anna Karenina. I believe it to be one of the finest works of fiction of all time. There is nothing I can possibly say that hasn't already been said about the brilliance of this work. The ending, however, came as quite a surprise to me and has profoundly perplexed me. While reading and thinking about Levin's spiritual enlightenment, a very particular question arose in me. The line \"If the good has a cause, it is no longer the good; if it has a consequence - a reward - it is also not the good. Therefore the good is outside the chain of cause and effect.\" struck me more than any other line in part 8. While I agree that \"goodness\" is in fact outside the realm of reason, as Levin puts it, I cannot help but seeing hypocrisy in this line of thinking. If Levin chooses to do good, is that not due at least partly to the spiritual satisfaction that comes of it? If one considers, like I do, spiritual satisfaction to be a reward, can it truly be \"the good\"? This is obviously a very small part of the overall message of the book, but I could not help but stumble upon it. ",

        "text": "If not, hopefully I can convince some people here to check out his work.\n\nFosse’s one of my favorite writers. Hailing from Norway, he’s probably best known for his plays - despite not really catching on in the English-speaking world, he’s supposedly the most performed living playwright - but he’s also written some acclaimed fiction and poetry.\n\nIf I had to compare him to any other writer, I’d say he’s arguably closest to Beckett, though I think Fosse’s work has much less humor. He frequently uses a spare style similar to mid to late Beckett, even stripping away punctuation, and of course there’s a certain bleakness both of them share. But Fosse’s more than a less funny imitation of Beckett, he has his own distinct style, and his most recognizable characteristic is probably his repetition. He repeats certain phrases over and over again for artistic effect. If you look around online at reviews, you can quickly see that this is not to everyone’s liking. I will say, however, that even if repetitious quotes but you off of him you should still look into him, as these frequently read much much better in context.\n\nEx. I’ve seen a few pulled quotes in reviews trashing his novel Melancholy. In most cases, the prose is not as repetitious as it is in those sections, and Fosse is making a certain point by writing like that. (Much of the book is told from the viewpoint of a painter on the verge of a mental breakdown, and this style of narration gives you a more intense look at him than a third person point of view would.)\n\nI think you’ll get a better view of his prose from this article: [https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/06/09/pure-prose/](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/06/09/pure-prose/)\n\nI think a lot of his plays are actually available in English, although I haven’t had much luck finding them in libraries and have had to buy them in the past. His best known is probably “Someone is Going to Come,” though my two favorites are “I am the Wind” and “Girl on the Sofa.”\n\nDespite being better known for his plays, however, his novels are what really sold me on him and made him one of my favorite writers, so I’ll discuss his books a bit more.\n\nMy favorites are probably the aforementioned Melancholy, Morning and Evening, and The Trilogy.\n\nMelancholy is probably the odd one out there, as its narration isn’t quite like how Fosse writes in nearly every of his books available in English. Like I said, it’s mostly about a painter on the verge of a mental breakdown (and the effects of it afterwards), based on a real-life figure, Lars Hertevig ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars\\_Hertervig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Hertervig)). There’s also a coda of sorts available, Melancholy II, about one of Lars’s sisters reflecting on her brother towards the end of her life.\n\nMorning and Evening has two parts. The first, relatively short, depicts the birth of a boy named Johannes, the second, the last day of a man bearing the same name (I thought it was the same person, but I’ve read differing opinions on this online). It is a bit cliché in its set up, but Fosse strips down the narrative an almost mythical, biblical level, and that combined with his depiction of old age makes this an incredible read. This is actually the one that me hooked on his prose.\n\nHis Trilogy is a set of three novellas, each building off of one another and continuing the story. In that same biblical, mythical prose, the first one begins with two homeless, expecting lovers, Asle and Alida, who try to find a place for themselves in the world. A few years ago it won one of the most prestigious Scandinavian literature prizes.\n\n(I’d also advise against starting with Aliss at the Fire or Boathouse. They’re both good books, though I found them a bit weaker than those three, as well as a bit more confusing.)",

        "text": "I went into the book thinking it would be just another hackneyed book written about the American South. I had just completed \"The Remains of the Day\" a few days back and before that, within the early summer I read three books by Faulkner, \"As I Lay Dying,\" \"The Sound and the Fury,\" and my favorite \"Absalom, Absalom!\". Faulkner holds a deep place in my heart as a writer and as a prose stylist. I enjoyed the more complex books of his, notably \"Absalom\" and \"Sound and the Fury\". I started *Sing* and my voracious appetite wasn't assuaged. To be honest, I found it underwhelming for the first 40 pages or so, only to read 200+ pages in one sitting, ending up to be enthralled by it.   \n\n\nThe prose isn't that of, say, Nabokov, another favorite of mine, but the lacking in the aesthetics of the language is made up with the strong and gripping storytelling. Jesmyn Ward has a knack for storytelling in the sense that it feels like you're caught listening to some ghost story only warmed by bonfire in the dead of night. I found myself savoring every page towards the end, as the characters were very believable and authentic. Guileless Jojo, quizzically lost Leonie and the dauntlessness of baby Kayla all held important positions in the narrative: they did not feel out of place not one bit. Only one or two characters perhaps needed to be fleshed out a little bit and maybe another 50 pages would have done *Sing* wonders but alas it was still a great read. Some compare this book to \"*As I Lay Dying\"* and I can get behind that a bit. Although, I do not think *Sing* is necessarily a complicated book. There is definitely room for analysis where one can garner further truths, yet with all those who see similarities with \"*As I Lay Dying*\" I do not think *Sing* is necessarily as complicated as the former.   \n\n\nThat being said, *Sing, Unburied, Sing* is definitely a work worth checking out. I may be biased in that Faulkner is within my top three favorite authors, so what did any of you think about *Sing*? ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/9310tr/pet_theory_dfw_and_salinger_should_be_grouped/",
        "text": "Have been thinking about this for a while.\n\nTo the extent that DFW is \"postmodern,\" he was really only performing variations on a theme, rather than extending the praxis of it (whatever we mean by \"it\" re: postmodernism), and his most well-known texts actually have intelligible, if dense, plots - they only seem \"experimental\" to folks who haven't dipped seriously into 70s avant garde lit.\n\nI've often seen Wallace compared to Pynchon. This seems both wrong to me, and, more importantly, lazy. Tonally, they couldn't be further apart. The earnestness with which Wallace approaches his subjects (both in his fiction and non-fiction) would be utterly alien to Pynchon the arch-satirist. The \"pet theory\" I allude to in the title is that Wallace &amp; Salinger is actually a much more natural grouping in the annals of American Lit. To wit:\n\n1. Neither depicted a credible adult (heterosexual) love affair in any of their works. (And I'm willing to argue this point.) This a bigger deal than it seems, if you zoom out and analyze their contemporaries. It's a strange, ascetic absence.\n2. Both were possessed of a certain self-declared earnestness. I don't have to say much about Wallace in this regard, because he made it explicit in \"E Pluribus Unum\" with the whole New Sincerity bit. But Salinger isn't far off in his embrace of Eastern metaphysics and his (in)famous rejection of fully grown women as sexual partners (see: his fallout w/ Joyce Maynard for not being \"pure\" anymore, after a certain age - she was 20). If you've read Salinger's later work (like \"Seymour: An Introduction\") I think it gives the lie to the idea that Catcher in The Rye is even a bit satirical. We can certainly treat it that way, but I don't think he would. \n3. Ultimately, this insularity and ascetic, sex-shy affect ends up seeming incredibly American to me; a weird psycho-spiritual Puritan vein of American literature. Wallace, of course, wrote a tirade against \"phallic\" male authors like Updike (whom, I should say, I don't have much love for), but didn't exactly indicate a way forward in terms of how male American writers might approach sexuality. This has always seemed to me a perpetually arrested-adolescent aspect of Wallace's work - the clean intellect struggling to overcome the messy paradoxes of the human in sexual love. It's not that he doesn't ever acknowledge sexuality as a driving force, but he does it in the almost antiseptic way of...dare I say...a Reddit comment. To this I would attribute much of his popularity. I sort of wonder what Wallace thought of Marguerite Duras.\n\nMainly just venting something that was rattling around in my head. Appreciate any feedback/pushback.  ",
