        "text": "Bart Ehrman, a secular scholar of Christianity I've followed for some years now, claims that the Book of Revelation states a gold city (actual gold, not golden) will descend from the sky and settle over Jerusalem. This city, according to the consensus interpretation of Revelation, is supposed to be 1,500 cubic miles (2,400 km³).\n\nI'm intrigued about what this would mean for the Earth. To what degree would this new, massive city affect the Earth's geology? Ignoring the biological cost of crushing many thousands of people and animals when the city finally lands, how would it affect our rotation or orbit, perhaps even Moon's orbit? What might be the thermal, hydrological, or atmospheric changes in the Levant?\n\nObviously this city wouldn't be a solid block of gold. A city needs streets and buildings after all. However, I doubt iron age civilizations could conceive of a skyscraper, let alone a modern city composed of them.\n\nSo, being generous to the scripture and historical context, what might a sprawling, impossibly tall Manhattan style city of gold spanning 2,400 km³ contered on the eastern Mediterranean do to the planet?\n\n(For thr record, I don't believe this event will actually happen.)",

        "text": "I want to start by saying I have no formal education or training in physics or string theory, but I've been up all night thinking on this and doing some calculations. I originally started off with the idea that nth dimensions for which 10 divides unevenly (ie 10/3 = 3.333 repeating) are constantly moving, as the volume is always being calculated for said dimensions.\n\nI then started to think about this from a BFSS matrix model perspective, where 10 is divided into 9 matrices of 1.11111 repeating and an infintessimally approaching zero +1 matrix to account for math in the lower dimensions. I thought, well if we divide any of the 9 large matrices by 1.111111 we will have an integer, so perhaps I can use such division to help with some extra-dimensional math.\n\nI went on to hypothesize that in the universe, dark matter might be matter on the other side of such an offset system of uneven division. Since we know there is more dark matter than matter, I assumed dark matter would be on a higher magnitude, and we could arrive at the ratio of matter to dark matter with this equation;\n\n10x(1.11111111111) / 2 = 5.5555555x\n\nPlugging in our x percentage of matter as 5,  we find our 5% corner of the universe has a 27.777777% corresponding amount of dark matter. We end up with a total value of 32.777777% matter in the universe, allowing for 67.222222% dark energy.\n\nTo solve for dark energy we can also use this equation;\n\n11x(1.111111) + 1.1x (1.1111111)\n\nAnd plugging in the 5% matter for x\n\n55(1.111111) + 5.5 (1.11111111)\n=60.5(1.11111111) = 67.2222222%\n\nAfter further research it appears the math used for this dark energy equation is similar to that found in a 10d E8xE8 heterotic string. I am hoping this could help show that E8 may be an accurate model of the effects dark energy. It is important to note, the reason I posted in this sub, even though this is a math based theory rather than scientific one, is because the scientifically studied estimates of these numbers are quite close to my calculations and continue to move closer toward my estimates with new measurements. I was unaware of that before doing my math, and had the experience of feeling I had predicted the values offhand. So, please feel free to chew me out for posting my mental math.",

This would of course not make sense on an atomic level, but we started discussing the mathematical models of it anyway.\n\nThe way we understand an incompressible fluid like water, is that it operates as though already at an immensely high pressure. Increasing the pressure in a vessel of air from 1 to 2 bar more or less doubles the mass, while doing the same in water results in a mass increase of a factor of 1.000001 or something like that. He's fond of saying water operates the same way air does under 30k bars of pressure or so.\n\nWhat it led me to consider is that heat engines are dependent on swept volume to generate work. While a gas at 2 bars pressure can double in volume when returning to 1 bar, an incompressible fluid can't.\n\nIs this reasoning correct? And does it apply to jet engines too?",

Why does \"absorbing and re-emitting\" photons cause the electrons to be repulsed from each other?\n\nBonus question: Later on, Griffiths mentions that a photon acts as a mediator which sends a \"message\" between two charged particles. The message can be either \"come closer\" or \"go away.\" What is the physical manifestation of this \"message?\" How is the photon storing information as to whether to come closer or to separate? \nThat data must be dependent upon the polarity of the two charged particles right?

Before searching the internet, I have theorized that friction is caused when the moving body and the surface creates instantaneous bonds but break because of the motion. When the bonds break, the energy is turned into heat. Thus kinetic energy is lost since the the motion breaks the bonds and turns their energy into heat. \n\nMost of the explanations on the internet goes as: surfaces are irregular at atomic level thus friction is created. I am not satisfied with this explanation. Can someone explain this thoroughly to me? Thanks.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nseveral years ago I kindly asked around in this sub a rather off-topic question. I wanted to know if the community is interested in tutorials, coding, scripts that link Space Science with Python. Python is an amazing programming language and I use it for my academic work as a guest scientist, as well as in industry (my current \"main job\").\n\nAstronomy and Space Science are ... I'd say \"beloved\" science domains. One does not need to be a scientist to enjoy beautiful images from JWST or spacecraft missions.\n\nBut what about the enthusiastic and skilled free-time coders and Open Source folks? Approaching astronomy and space topics from a coding domain is difficult without prior knowledge or experience.\n\nAny that's where I try to \"fill the gap\", and where I asked around in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g4bg9f/space\\_science\\_with\\_python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g4bg9f/space_science_with_python/)\n\nIndeed I did some stuff in the last couple of years, months and weeks. I did not want to spam the r/Physics community (I engaged more with the Python community). But still: you guys gave me the best and frequent feedback and I want to share with you my journey so far. Again: thanks again for all the contributions!\n\nOne of my recent projects is a 16-parts tutorial on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). Quick intro: NEOs are objects that approach the Sun within a distance of max. 1.3 AU. 1.0 AU corresponds to the average distance between Earth and Sun (around 150 Million km). And in this series I try to answer questions like:\n\n*How many objects are out there? Where are they and how do they \"travel\" around the Sun? Are they bright? If yes, how bright? How can we compute their brightness? Can we also model a theoretical distribution of NEOs to get an understanding where we have \"to look at\"? And what kind of telescopes are needed?*\n\nSpace Science is approachable; and there are tons of libraries and Open Access data for Python. I try to gather my academic knowledge and create these tutorials to support students, free-time coders and everyone, who is into Python and astronomy. If you have ideas, feedback, please let me know.\n\nIf hope this is not too off-topic!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThomas\n\n[GitHub Link](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/tree/main/%5BProject%5D-Near-Earth-Objects)\n\n[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVyFqVuuM6g&amp;list=PLNvIBWkEdZ2hL5be8mQdpTU3BjhKIhD6L)",

        "text": "There is no widely accepted theory of quantum gravity yet, so it is difficult to say for certain whether it would be a ratio or a fundamental force. However, some theoretical physicists have proposed that gravity may not be a fundamental force in the same way that the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces are, but rather could be an emergent phenomenon that arises from the behavior of particles and their interactions in a more fundamental theory.\n\nThis idea is related to the concept of \"emergence,\" which is a common theme in complex systems. In some systems, complex behaviors and properties can arise from the interactions between simpler components, without the need for a separate governing principle. For example, the behavior of a flock of birds can emerge from the interactions between individual birds, without the need for a separate \"flocking force.\"\n\nSimilarly, some physicists have proposed that gravity could emerge from the interactions between particles and their underlying quantum mechanical behavior, without the need for a separate fundamental force. In this view, gravity would be a ratio or relationship between the properties of particles, rather than a distinct force. This idea is still being explored and developed, and it remains to be seen whether it will be a viable solution for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity.",

It features a train moving in an almost vaccum to reduce drag and increase speed, I was told that a Braking system was still not invented for the Hyperloop, So i had a Idea. The Idea basically is to use an Electro Magnet and an Metal that can support Eddy Currents (Copper or Aluminium). So What if we fit a Electro Magnet to the train and than when we want it to break we can activate the Electro Magnet and let the Eddy Currents form in the Copper and Aluminium in the Pod in which the train is travelling thus slowing down the train to a stop. So i wanted to ask that is this idea for the braking system actually possible and can Function?",
