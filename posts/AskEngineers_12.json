My question is on all DPDT that I’ve seen they have 1 com. Can I attach this com to both the negative of the battery and the negative of the power supply? Would this cause issues with the battery if the power supply was being used as the negative is technically hooked up to the battery negative terminal? Am I missing something completely and there’s just a better way to do this? Both supplies would power the same circuit so maybe a DPDT switch isn’t the best, but it’s what I came up with. Any and all advice is appreciated",

        "text": " \n\nHello, I am trying to find the power needed to spin a klann linkage. The linkage is built as in the following image: [https://imgur.com/a/0SFb4xQ](https://imgur.com/a/0SFb4xQ)\n\nThis  linkage has 3 anchor points (green, pink, and light blue) that will be  locked to a structure, and it will be moved by a motor that will act on  the pink anchor point, in a clockwise direction. The high rpm will be  converted to lower rpm and higher torque through a reducer. Also, I am  assuming there will be friction at the joints, and a variable force  (directed upwards) applied vertically at the lowest tip of the big  orange part, whose max value should be around 2.5N.\n\nThe angular velocity of the pink crank should be around 10-15rpm clockwise, so I have this constraint to satisfy.\n\nI  modeled the linkage (I didn't verify the rods for different loads yet,  as I still don't know what they will be) so I have mass and inertia of  each rod and connector, but at this point I am quite stuck on the  process of finding the torque needed for the motor. I have no idea about  how to account for the reduced inertia of the whole linkage, nor the  torque at joints due to friction, or the effect of the applied force at  the tip of the lowest orange point.\n\nMy  intuition says that the reduced inertia of the whole linkage at the  pink anchor should vary with the angle of the crank, and so with time.  The motor then should \"feel\" this changing inertia and should have  enough power to keep up with the change and keep the required rpm  steady. So I tried studying the kinematics of this linkage in an attempt  to find some kind of formula for reduced inertia wrt the input angle,  but I am kinda getting into a rabbit hole, as the analytical formulas  for the other angles are highly complex and it's taking pages of  calculation to solve, with little success. I wanted to see if I could  find the maximum value of the inertia and then use that to calculate the  power needed, but I am not sure this is the right way to do this.\n\nAbout  the friction at the joints, I was thinking I could model that as  concentrated torques, and then calculate the needed torque by solving a  static problem. I don't know at what input angle I should solve it for  worst case anyway, so I am stuck there. Same for the applied force, I  don't know the worst case angle, and the big nonlinear formulas relating  angles seem daunting.\n\nI tried  searching for something like this all day, with no luck so far, apart  for some papers on kinematic analysis that bring to the big equations  above.\n\nDoes anyone know of a way to properly do this?",

        "author": "isleepinahammock",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/112f0na/could_you_make_a_vacuum_balloon_by_constructing_a/",
        "text": "This idea has had me fascinated lately, and I wanted to run it by the engineering community here. I'll divide this post into two parts, skip the first if you already know what vacuum balloons are and want to see the meat of the idea.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO VACUUM BALLOONS\n\nFirst of all, what is a vacuum balloon? Well a vacuum balloon is a hypothetical lighter than air craft, it would rely on buoyancy to stay aloft, just like a regular balloon. However, instead of being filled with helium or heated air, it would be a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber displaces air, experiences a buoyant force, and can therefore fly.\n\nWe've known vacuum balloons theoretically possible for centuries. However, no one has ever managed to create one, as far as we know. Without an internal gas to balance the pressure of the atmosphere, the vessel walls must be strong enough to resist the compression of the atmosphere directly. A vacuum balloon needs to operate like a submarine, rigidly resisting the outward pressure of the atmosphere. This is doable on a submarine, but to be buoyant in air, a vessel must have very, very thin walls. And such thin walls easily buckle when under high compressive loads, so vacuum balloons have remained theoretical.\n\nSo why would anyone want a vacuum balloon? Sure you get slightly more buoyancy than helium or hydrogen, but why go to the hassle? I think the key advantage of a vacuum balloon would be longevity. Helium and hydrogen balloons slowly lose their lifting gases through diffusion through their thin walls. Even if your balloon is perfectly sealed, eventually all your lifting gas will disperse. The atmosphere would slowly disperse through the walls of and into a vacuum balloon, but that could be remedied. A small onboard solar-powered pump could continuously pump out any atmospheric gases that seeped in. If you could build one, in principle it could remain aloft nearly indefinitely. It would be more like a satellite that lasts for years than a disposable balloon. \n\nPOSSIBLE CONSTRUCTION MECHANISM\n\nSo with the introduction out of the way, let's get to the core concept. Steel, aluminum, and other metals are capable of retaining high residual stresses from their manufacture. For example, uneven cooling can result can result in high compressive and tensile stresses in the various portions of a hot-rolled steel cross section. This same principle is seen in tempered glass. Tempered glass holds a large amount of residual stresses inside of it from uneven cooling. When tempered glass is damaged, these stresses are rapidly released, tearing the sheet of glass into tiny pieces. \n\nWhat I've been wondering is, could you make a very thin hollow spherical shell out of steel, aluminum, or other material that could have high uniform residual tensile stress.\n\nI don't know how you would make this, but let me illustrate with a naive first approach. Start with a solid sphere of the sand used in sand mold casting, or something with reasonable cohesion and melting point higher than steel, aluminum, or whatever other metal you choose. Outside of this sand inner sphere, have a hollow spherical outer sphere, made of some material with a high melting point and high tensile stress. Essentially, imagine a mold you would use to cast a hollow spherical shell. \n\nThen, pour in molten steel, aluminum, etc. Except, don't just pour in the metal, inject it under extremely high pressure. Force the molten metal to be highly compressed in its mold. You now have a thin spherical shell of highly pressurized molten metal, retained by the inner and outer mold walls.  Then, while maintaining pressure, let the shell cool and fully solidify. \n\nNow, release the mold. What happens? The pressure was forcing this spherical thin-walled shell in a highly compressed state. With this pressure removed, the shell will want to expand. However, as a solid, it now has its own tensile strength resisting this expansion. You've now created a sphere with extremely high locked-in uniform tensile stress. You would need some variations from the uniform stress condition, as you do need at least some small holes in the vessel walls. Through these small holes, you can slowly remove the sand or whatever else served as the inner wall of the mold. \n\nOnce removed, you now have a very thin-walled spherical shell that it trying to tear itself to pieces. It wants to expand, but its own tensile strength prevents it. If you cut into it, it will tear itself to ribbons from all the locked-in tensile stress.\n\nNow, imagine pumping the air out of this shell. As you do, atmospheric pressure will want to crush it. However, the shell has large uniform residual tensile stresses. As long as the compressive stresses induced by the atmosphere are less than the residual tensile stresses, the material in the shell will remain in tension. As long as it remains in tension throughout, buckling will be prevented. Buckling is the main problem for a vacuum balloon, I believe the existing materials we have should be capable of resisting material failing by stress limits such as crushing/yielding. However, such thin-walled vessels are very prone to buckling, and they fail due to this geometric instability. If you could keep the entire shell in tension, buckling would be prevented.\n\nThis concept is related to the concepts used in prestressed concrete. In prestressed concrete, tensioned tendons are used to force a concrete beam or dome to remain in compression throughout its cross section, even when carrying flexural loads. This concept would be the opposite, forcing a thin hollow spherical shell to remain in tension even when subject to external compressive loads.\n\nAnd I think this might allow vacuum chambers with walls thin enough they could be buoyant in atmosphere. If geometric instability like buckling of the walls is the real limit, then building the vessel with high internal residual stresses might sidestep buckling all together. \n\nManufacturing such a thing would be incredibly difficult. You would need molds that were precise enough to maintain a uniform but extremely thin casting thickness. You would also need to do a lot of work on the thermal expansion/contraction of the inner mold, outer mold, and have to take great care to ensure cooling occurs both uniformly and in the manner you intend. \n\nROUGH MATH\nLet's prove that it's geometric instability/buckling that is the limit, not actual material yield strength. \n\nLet's say you make this out of aluminum with a diameter of one meter. At 20 degrees C, air has a density of 1.2 kg/m^3. A 1 meter spherical balloon will displace 0.63 kg of air. For a vacuum balloon to remain buoyant, it would need to have a mass of no more than 0.63 kg. Aluminum has a density of about 2700 kg/m^3. The walls of the vessel would need to be 0.0074 cm think. Using the thin-walled pressure vessel equation, the walls of the vessel would under a stress of 684 MPa, at the upper range of some aluminum alloys. However, if made out of certain more exotic aerospace alloys of titanium and steel, the material would have sufficient strength if buckling could be prevented. Rough math suggests Titanium Beta C would be just over the minimum threshold. But ideally materials with even higher specific strength would be used. If high residual stresses tensile stresses could somehow be retained in a material like carbon fiber or xylon, they would easily have enough material strength.  \n\nI used equations for regular thin-walled pressure vessels here because the high residual stresses in the concept would ensure that the vessel would remain in tension even with the air removed from it. In other words, with the materials we have, it is easily possible to create a spherical tank that could hold 1 atm of internal gauge (for example, if we placed such a tank in orbit), while keeping that tank to a mass less than 0.63 kg. Material limits, in terms of raw yield strength, are not what prevent us from creating a vacuum balloon. Buckling is what prevents this. And if high enough uniform residual tensile stresses could be locked in at the time of manufacture, such a sphere could have all of the air removed from it and still retain its rigidity, as its walls would never enter a net compressive state. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhat do you all think of the concept? I'm hoping to pick the brains of some fellow engineers. Could you prevent a very thin-walled vacuum chamber from buckling if locked in residual tensile stresses at the moment of manufacture? This is something that I thought of last night, and it's been really eating away at me. Just want to see what others think, and if there are any glaringly obvious things I might be missing.",

        "text": "I apologize in advance, as my post will likely have many dumb questions. This is also a lengthy post, so please feel free to scroll down and check the TL;DR questions that I wrote at the end:\n \nI'm a Mechanical Engineer (been working for 2 years in the industry after completing my MS). Unfortunately I was recently laid off from a big tech company after working there for 1.5 years.\n \nMy two internships and the full-time job have been design engineer roles where I mostly used CAD, injection molding, and 3D printing technologies (also releasing vehicle components since I worked in automotive). \n\nAs part of my work, I've collaborated frequently with manufacturing engineers and process engineers since our products have to undergo mass production. As a result, I'm aware of the assembly environment and the important work done by machinists and technicians (my job actually involved collaborating with them to support production).\n \nWith the current market situation, getting interview calls to find a new job has been very tough, and I am losing hope with each passing day.\n\nMy experience so far has been chiefly consumer electronics and automotive, but I'm very interested in medical device design too. Nowadays, I've been coming across more 'Manufacturing Engineer' job postings than 'Design Engineer' (These ME openings are at some big medical device and automotive employers).\n \nI’m hesitant to apply for manufacturing engineer roles for various reasons, but mainly because I fear I'll never be able to transition out of manufacturing engineering once I get into it. So I just wanted to get some input from this community on my doubts.\n \nI'm ashamed to say this (being a Mechanical Engineer), but I've dealt with OCD and compulsive behavior ever since I was a kid. I've also developed an extreme fear of prolonged exposure to chemicals and pollution (chemophobia/mysophobia). I've been seeing a therapist for quite a while and have been coping to overcome these (sadly, it still significantly affects my daily life)\n \nIn my jobs/internships, I've mostly worked on design work and moderate hands-on tasks (3D printing, assembly, and tear down of plastic parts). I've used power tools briefly (to modify parts, create holes, trim out edges), made silicone molds, and so on, but all these tasks have been mostly with wearing work gloves and a mask. I often got raised eyebrows at work because I was extra cautious while doing any manual labor, while others were mostly fond of getting their hands dirty (which I agree with).\n \nI remember one time, me and my coworker cutting some jigs in the tool shop (using a machine), and he handled the cut jigs with his bare hands the entire time. The jig had shards of metal around it, and I could notice those shavings spread on his hands. He was so proud of the work and encouraged me to do the same and not worry about wearing gloves. That experience made me really nervous.\n \nSince I've mostly interned at bigger companies, they had a dedicated team of plant technicians and operators who were in charge of all the manufacturing operations. My job mainly required interacting with them to understand manufacturing issues and observe the operating environment.\n \nAs I've mostly been a design engineer in my previous roles, I've thankfully not worked on stuff that involved 'getting my hands dirty' (like working with metals or handling parts, or working in extremely hot or cold environments). \n \nI know this is shameful, as the main essence of being a Mechanical Engineer is to 'get your hands dirty' and develop hands-on skills. I feel guilty about it. But I still love mechanical design, and I'm proud of choosing this field. I love going to work every day (I'm trying to get better to overcome my psychological fears). Like I mentioned, I've gained hands-on skills in my career, but it has been limited to 3D printing, plastic assembly, and teardown of components.\n\nTL;DR \n\nAll this being said, I have a few questions, which is the purpose of my post:\n\n- If I take a manufacturing engineer role, how difficult will it be to transition from manufacturing to design engineer/R&amp;D engineer? Specifically, if I work as a mfg engineer in medical devices, is it impossible to switch to R &amp; D Engineer later on?\n(I've had multiple people in the industry telling me it's going to be difficult, while others have suggested it's doable. So I am a bit confused)\n\n- How much manual labor should I expect if I consider a manufacturing engineer position? Will the role require me to get my hands dirty? Will the work require frequently setting up machines, playing with metal parts, and dealing with toxic chemicals all the time? Will I be spending most of my time on the plant floor? Will my job be mainly in the vicinity of extreme environments/biohazards?\nSorry again for these questions. I just wanted to know if I'm cut out for taking up a manufacturing engineer position.\n\n- I love CAD, and I spent most of my time working in SolidWorks on hobby projects. Will I be completely cut off from CAD work if I work in manufacturing? I want to continue building my skills in DFM, CAD, GD&amp;T, and plastic design. I fear mfg will steer me away from these activities\n\nAlso, FYI, the manufacturing engineer roles I'm looking for are primarily based in big medical device and auto companies (with &gt;5000 employees). Most of their job descriptions say, 'support manufacturing processes, write documents, and help operators with machines'. So I'm not quite sure how much manual labor is involved. I've also seen previous posts on this sub, and I get that mfg is generally a stressful job to work.",

        "text": "I’m actually an engineering student myself who has a particular interest in older firearms. I plan on in the future working on a project of making a top breaking revolver of my own design. The securing latch on the top has been done in many ways in the past. The Schofield had a latch that would break it open on half cock. The subsequent top breaks had buttons that you would pinch on either side to open it. The Webley had a lever on the left side that extended to the top. This allowed you to extend with your thumb to open it similar to the placement of a traditional cylinder release on a swing out. In terms of ease of use and ergonomics, the webley is my favorite. But its hard to say whether it is the best and most secure overall. The last serious top breaking revolver, the MP-412 used a latch system similar if not the same as the pinch button designs of the early 1900s. However a british company Andersen Wheeler brought the webley revolver back and updated it to be shot in 357 magnum. I don't know what materials they used and how durable it actually is, but its safe to say it was made with looks mostly in mind as opposed to continuous use with powerful loads. I just want to figure out a way to make the top breaking design as strong as possible. One day I would like to invest in making my own revolver idea into reality. This of course would take a lot of capital and experience, but I've got a lot of time to get both. But the point is to make a top break design revolver that is nigh indestructible. Probably made from 4140 steel for durability and made to handle hundreds of thousands of 357 magnum loads like a MR73. I believe with the right materials, craftsmanship and design, this can become a possibility.",

At this moment, I have a good science background and GPA, but a relative lack on internships and marketable skills.

But the reason why I opted to do Physics was that I plan to do undergrad in Physics and grad in Mech E, I do not feel like doing intensive engineering design works and being too technical right from the beginning given that I am not from the US; but rather, I would like to take more time familiarizing the academic environment and strengthen my science foundation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven that I am a little worried about myself, I wonder if I am still possible to become an automotive engineer? Should I spend two more semesters in graduate school taking more senior level mechanical engineering courses? Or, what should I do to make sure I achieve my dream? I really want to work and live in the US for the rest of my life, and now my only plan is to start as entry-level engineer, and gradually work towards the top-tier engineer.

        "text": "Hi, I am designing and testing various propeller configurations for an underwater drone (ROV). The motors I am using are [A2212](https://www.rhydolabz.com/documents/26/BLDC_A2212_13T.pdf), 1000kV (slowest I could find), powered by 12V, through a 30A ESC. I am using these motors because they don't mind being submerged, are easy to control and are very compact. On the downside, they are difficult to run at low RPM. I tried using traditional propellers, but because they cavitate a lot due to high speeds of the motor, they are not efficient, and blades get damaged over time. I switched to toroidal propeller design, which produces far less cavitation. \n\nThe design criteria for the propeller is:\n\n1. As efficient as possible. Yes, I know, difficult to achieve with high RPM motor, but still.\n2. Ability to provide very low thrust at lower RPM range, while still having decent thrust at high speeds. I need that low thrust for precise maneuvering of the ROV, station and orientation keeping, etc.\n3. As small as possible.\n\nMy initial design was a 63mm diameter, 6 blade prop with 45° pitch, housed in a duct. I chose 6 blades because I calculated that they provide a reasonably large cross-sectional area. More blades have very diminishing returns, and needlessly increase weight.\n\nI tested this configuration in a bucket of water. I don't have a jig to measure thrust, so I just eye-balled it by how difficult it is to hold still, and I also observed power draw. It drew 3.6 Amps at max PWM. I realized this thruster is way too powerful - even at the lowest possible speed.\n\nSo I designed a new configuration - 49 mm propeller, also 6 blades, also 45° pitch, pretty much a scaled-down version, with around 1/3 of the sectional area of the first one. I tested it - and the results were unexpected: it drew 18.6 Amps, and generated so much thrust that it nearly destroyed the bucket. It even burned out 1100W fuses on my lab PSU. Here is a comparison between the big prop (3.6A) and the smaller prop (18.6A): [https://i.imgur.com/wGySgWO.png](https://i.imgur.com/wGySgWO.png)\n\nSome prop guys I know suggested that the larger prop was not able to reach full speed, therefore capped out at 3.6 A, while the smaller one reached full RPM, and was overloaded. Which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I don't understand prop design.\n\nI know that prop design is an extremely complicated field, but I'm not going for cutting-edge tech here - I just want to figure out the basic rules of thumb, to minimize physical prototypes. It's just a DIY project anyway. Can anyone advise, what changes should I make to reduce thrust and power draw without wasting efficiency? Should I reduce the diameter of the prop even further? Or reduce number of blades? Reduce (or increase?) pitch angle? I thought going with smaller prop would get it closer to my criteria, but it ended up being far more powerful than the big prop. Clearly this is not very intuitive, so that's why I'm asking for some advice.",

Between the screw head and the rotating plate is a wave disc spring with N=3 waves. Then between the plate and the block there are 2 flat washers. With the thicknesses and tolerances of the different washers and the plate I calculated that the axial load (P) on the spring is about 40N so I do believe there is some friction at play while the plate is rotating.\n\nHow do I calculate moment on the shoulder screw caused by the friction from the spring?\n\nLet’s say “D” is outer diameter, “d” in inner diameter, “M_ss” is shoulder screw moment, and “μ” is kinetic friction coefficient. Use 1, 2, and 3 for washer subscripts and “p” for plate subscript. Definitely add whatever other variables are needed.",

I want to get into both hardware and software design.\n\nWhen it comes to EE course offered in India, it's mostly focused into High voltage and power plant stuff.
