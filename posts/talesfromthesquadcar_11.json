        "text": "My dad told me this story earlier as I asked him a question from another reddit post about an arrest that a police officer felt bad about. The thread is so full that it's buried, but from reading it I came across this sub, and I thought this might be a good contribution.\n\nDAD'S STORY:\n\nThis story took place in the early 1980's in NYC, when he was around 23 or 24 years old, and was working in transit (subway). He said one day they were in the roll call room, which is where all of the cops gather at the beginning of the shift to I guess go over the plan of the day or whatever. This was located underground in a room in the subway system. A train pulls into the station outside, blowing one long horn and one short, which is a signal of distress on the train. So all of the cops get up to go respond. But my dad was either running late or wasn’t ready, and didn’t have his utility belt or radio and whatnot on his body yet. So he gets everything on, and by this time everyone else has already gone outside.\n\nWhen he gets out, the other cops are all gone, having went to find the conductor or whoever made the distress signal. So he is by himself on the platform, when he hears some commotion down on the other end. He sees a young guy with blood all over him yelling. And my dad approaches him and asks “what's going on here?” The guy says “she stabbed me!”. Then nearby is a business man in a suit with the jacket off, and he says “she stabbed me too!” and my dad notices he is bleeding from his arm. So he asks who and they said a skinny lady (with some other physical details that aren’t relevant to the story) and that she went a certain way up a staircase. So he goes up the staircase and as soon as he looks up there is a pretty frail looking woman standing there, and he says something to her and she turns around and lunges at him with a large, bloody kitchen knife. He dodges it but loses his balance and stumbles down a little, and draws his gun, intending to maybe shoot her. He hesitates, thinking that what if it ricochets or he misses, and it hits someone else. Besides he figures he thinks he can handle this woman physically without needing to shoot her. So he puts his gun away and grabs her and gets a hold of her arms so she can’t stab him. But to his surprise she is extremely strong, nearly stronger than he is. He cannot subdue her and it is all he can do to hold onto her arms so she can’t stab him. He can’t grab his radio or gun now or anything. So he starts yelling “Help, help!”. Finally the rest of the cops that went a different way make their way there, and help subdue the woman. My dad ends up making the arrest. Now apparently the woman is not in her right mind, and she can’t be held at the station, so she is sent to a psychiatric hospital. But the only psychiatric hospital with criminal cells that can house females is all the way out in Queens (the incident took place in a subway station in Manhattan).\n\nAs a result, the next day he has to go pick her up and bring her back for arraignment or processing or whatever the procedure is (I didn’t catch the detail on that). And when he encounters her at the psychiatric hospital, he says she is one of the sweetest, kindest women he’s ever met. She tells him I hope I didn’t hurt you, and he tells her no you didn’t hurt me. He asks the psych people what her deal is, and it turns out she has a severe mental illness (schizophrenia or something like that, I am not sure) and has to be on meds all the time. Apparently this is how she normally is, a sweet, frail lady. But through some mix-up or whatever mistake, she didn’t have them, and couldn’t get access to them quick enough, and had a major psychotic episode and that was what he encountered in the subway. He said on the way back to the city driving, she asked him again if she hurt him, and apologized, and he told her she didn’t but she did hurt a few other people, and she begins sobbing hysterically with guilt. So he said he didn’t necessarily feel bad about the actual arrest, but about the whole situation in general. How a few pills could turn this very sweet woman into what happened on the subway. And that it was so close to an innocent bystander being killed, or him killing her, or her killing him. As a side note, he said that this was one of only three times in his career that he would have been justified using deadly force, but that every time he refrained and was able to resolve the situation without shooting anyone. So he is thankful for that.",

Drank a couple of thoses to help me stay awake during the class. Problem is that from all the sugar in the drinks, I had to take a dump.. fast. But I had just left the school. So instead of stopping at a gas station or a store ( I have a problem with public restrooms), I decided to drive fast for about 15 mins to my house. I thought I could make it but boy I was wrong. I was halfway to my house when I was pulled over.. I was going 70 in a 45.. crap! So as I was pulled over.. I was struggling to hold everything in. I saw the cop getting out of his car and since I had to go bad.. I got out of my car too",

        "text": "Story time. This happened when I was riding home with my friend from a college party. I was 17 at the time and he was 20. This was in the middle of winter and snow was on the ground. \n\n\nWe get about halfway through the interstate portion of the trip when his car breaks down. Fuck. I call my sister and she gives me the number for the courtesy patrol. They don't show up. Close to a half hour of being stranded in the cold, a police cruiser pulls up behind us. Fuck. I'm drunk. My friend only had a couple but he is also under age.\n\n\nWithout hesitating my friend gets out of the car and walks to the cruiser. After a couple long minutes he walks back to the car.\n\n\n**Friend:** The cop says he will try to call the courtesy patrol again but in the meantime he says we can sit in his cruiser because it's cold.\n\n**Me:** Fuck.\n\n\nSo we get in the back seat of the cruiser and start bull shitting with the cop. He asks which school we go to and my friend tells him he goes to the local college. I don't say much throughout the conversation. Eventually he asks the inevitable question.\n\n\n**Cop:** Have you boys been drinking?\n\n**Me:** (Fuck.) No! (I blurt it out. Stupid.) \n\n**Cop:** Don't lie to me, I can smell it.\n\n**Friend:** Yeah I had a couple. \n\n**Cop:** You're okay to drive, right?\n\n**Friend:** Yes, sir.\n\n**Cop:** Okay.\n\n\nPhew! That was close. A few minutes later the cop asks where I go to school and I tell him X County.\n\n\n**Cop:** Oh shit you're still in high school and you've been drinking??\n\n**Me:** (Fuck.) Yes, sir.\n\n**Cop:** I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.\n\n**Me:** (You wh-whaaa??) *nervous laughter*\n\n\nAfter waiting a while the cop says, \"This is ridiculous, put your seatbelts on.\".. Fuck! We're going downtown! We look at each other in fright but don't say anything as the cop flies down a snowy road pushing 100 mph.\n\n\nWe thought we were done for but to our relief, he pulls in the state road parking lot and spots a lady getting into her patrol truck. \n\n\n**Cop:** Ma'am, who's on this route?\n\n**Lady:** Uhhh, I'm about to be. Heading out now.\n\n**Cop:** Do you know these boys have been waiting over an hour?\n\n**Lady:** Oh sorry, I'll head straight there.\n\n**Cop:** Yeah. You will.\n\n\nFuck yeah! The lady helped us and we survived to party another day all thanks to that badass cop. \n\n\nEdit: I'm glad some of you enjoyed reading this! I have had a few other close calls with the police. I'll post another one tomorrow!",

        "text": "I can’t even count how many special assignments I was given solely due to the fact I made an effort to get out of my cruiser and get to know my local groups of homeless guys, gang members, and day laborers. It felt like a superpower to listen to the boards get read, hear a description of an unknown robbery suspect, and be able to call up the investigator and tell him (usually with a good deal of accuracy) who he needed to include in his photo array. A bit of advice for new street cops – if you can, get out of your car, try and be personable, and do your best to remember names and faces. It really will serve you well in your career. \n\nI was working on a task force to assist in the investigation of a particular heinous murder. The young female victim had practically no ties to the area and had presumably just stopped in the high-crime area to purchase some unique foods from a Spanish grocery store. Her attempt to exit her comfort zone ended up with her lifeless body being found in a ditch half a mile from where the security camera last saw her alive. \n\nThere were few leads to follow up on for the lead investigator. Checking with the other businesses in the strip mall turned up no additional surveillance. Posters in both English and Spanish were plastered all over the neighborhood with the victim’s smiling face featured prominently, pleading for any information a passerby may be able to offer. After two weeks of getting nowhere, the detective was granted the ability to form his task force. \n\nMy primary role was to get out and befriend the community in an effort to generate leads. The area the attack occurred wasn’t my usual beat so I was entering virgin territory. The day laborers were easy enough: I took care of some minor civil squabbles concerning non-payment by contractors and I became their hero. \n\nNext came the gang members. I rode with the local bike team and gang division and perused the database we had crafted with all the local MS and 18th Street members. They were frequently surprised when I’d see them passing by on foot and be able to call to them by name. A little respect doled out and I became one of the “cool cops,” or at least was moved into a status where a member wouldn’t get beat up by his brothers-in-crime just for being seen with me. \n\nA few weeks mining my new contacts led to absolutely zero quality leads. I was practically begging but had no reason to believe the adamant denials by the two groups were anything but truthful. I knew I’d have to move on to the most difficult group to infiltrate: the homeless. \n\nI recruited Byron from my old squad to help me track the homeless population during daylight hours. We started with the drunks: the kings of the homeless realm, and left the crazy-crew and criminals for later perusal. The drunks were easy to find, brazenly taking long swigs from 40 ounce malt liquor bottles in front the 7-11. We sat back and watched, attempting to determine who the alpha male was. You’d think you would want to approach the leader first, but you’d be wrong. The trick was to figure out who wanted to overtake the throne and approach that guy. They’re much more open to talking to cops because they have less to lose. Also, they like having a contact to call if their eventual coup fails and they need a safe place to retreat. \n\nWe identified the “beta” and made contact while he was relieving himself behind a large bush next to the convenience store. \n\n“I’m sure you could ask to use the bathroom inside.” I said as I approached. \n\nThe urinating subject flinched and quickly tucked his member away, zipping up and spinning to confront us in the same motion. His eyes widened upon taking in our uniforms and the small, dark patch spreading through his nether region indicated his fear (or at least lack of a strong prostate). \n\n“Oh, sorry, I think it’s occupied in there.” He muttered, averting his eyes. He was in his forties, maybe fifties – it was difficult to tell due to years of hard life and sun abuse – and had a slightly hunched back. I introduced myself and explained why I was in the area. \n\nHis expression turned from fearful to relieved as he realized I was more friend than foe. “I heard about that little girl. Sad stuff, she should’ve been more careful, pretty girl walking around here.” He bowed his head in mock grief but looked up to us again a moment later. \n\n“Any cash out there for someone who could help?” He gave us a big, brown toothed smile and batted his grimy eyes. I knew I had a fish on the hook.\n\nEventually I was able to secure a pre-paid phone for Chuck (his name wasn’t Charles, the knick-name was a relic from his Army time when he worked as a cook) and set him out to act as my agent. \n\nThe second day on the job I got a call from him while Byron and I were walking a well-worn foot trail in the wooded area nearby, looking for camps. \n\n“Officer! I found a guy they say peeps into apartments. He’s acting weird, going in and out of a dumpster area and grabbing his junk. Get over here!” He excitedly requested.\n\nWe made it to the intersection he had identified and saw the dumpster enclosure he had mentioned in the call. I scanned the area and saw Chuck peeking from around the side of the building across the courtyard from us, pointing with fervor at the enclosure. Byron and I made our way slowly to the opening and I gave a silent countdown on my fingers. My closed fist was the signal and we quickly rounded the corner, confronting the potential threat. \n\nI don’t know if it was possible for the guy to be in a less threatening position. He was bracing himself with one hand against the wooden slats of the privacy fence encompassing the dumpsters. His other hand was simultaneously grasping his dropped pants and a wad of Dominos Pizza napkins. His bare ass hovered off the ground and a slow stream of noxious goo dripped from it, forming a spreading mound of concentrated awful. His eyes were squeezed shut in the duel capacity of painful effort and concentration. Small pockets of escaping gas sputtered from his parted cheeks, and his body shook with a couple after-shock tremors before he opened his eyes and breathed a relieved sigh. He was mid wipe when he realized he wasn’t alone.\n\n“Osea…oy… hola officiales.” He left the wipe incomplete and drew his pants up, grimacing as he buttoned the waist. As a result of the awkwardness of the situation, or possibly the utter lack of reply by Byron and me due the horrors we had just taken in, he approached with an out stretched hand.\n\nByron jerked back in an involuntary reaction and skewed his face into an expression of terror. I made an attempt to kindly pass on the handshake and asked him, aside from the obvious, what he was doing in the area. He quickly apologized for the situation we had discovered him in and explained a friend lives nearby and gives him food when he comes home from work at noon every day. To hasten our escape, I accepted the story but took his information down as well as a voluntary Polaroid of his smiling face before leaving. \n\n“What the hell did he eat? Good lord, that was nasty!” Byron couldn’t get over the atrocity. A second later my phone rang; Chuck was calling again.\n\n“Well?” He asked. “You guys going to pay me for finding the killer?” I then explained to him what he had subjected us to and he laughed loud enough for Byron to hear as he walked a few feet to my side. Byron snatched the phone from my hand. \n\n“If you walk us into another asshole taking a shit, I’ll personally figure out a reason to charge you with this murder!” He hung up in a huff and I quickly chastised him. \n\n“Dude, he might be the only guy to figure this thing out, don’t push him away. Besides, he did find us a guy we didn’t even have on our radar.”\n\n“Whatever, man. I just wasn’t happy to walk in on the human soft-serve machine back there.” He was pouty as we returned to the wooded path we had been surveying.\n\nA few minutes later we came upon a camp in the middle of a clearing that opened up off the trail. It was vacant so we split up, each searching our own half. I was flipping over some milk crates and plywood beds when I found it: a monster that would become legend amongst our squad mates. I called Byron over and he dropped what he was doing to trot in my direction. \n\n“There it is, man!” I happily clapped him on his back and pointed to my discovery.\n\n“What? A giant two headed dildo?” Because that’s what it was: a three foot long, peach colored, two-headed phallus. Byron looked confused. \n\n“Yeah, dude! That was one of the only clues they had! C’mon, we have to collect this!” I stood back, waiting for Byron to obey. \n\nHe looked at me, the same confused look still on his face. “What? Collect? ME?!?”\n\nI just nodded and tried to make the best ”we-solved-the-case” face I could. His shoulders eventually dropped and he looked for a moment like he might cry. He looked back to me with pleading eyes but I ignored his agony. Finally he took some gloves off his belt and reluctantly slid them on.\n\nHe picked up the beast as if it was radioactive; two fingers pinching it mid-way down the shaft and making as little contact as necessary to maintain the proper friction to still hold it in the air, hovering mere feet from Byron’s disgusted face.\n\nCLICK-WHIRRRRRR\n\nI snapped the Polaroid picture before he knew what was happening. I took the freshly expelled piece of evidence from the camera and shook it in the air as I turned to walk back to our cruiser. The loud THUMP and rapid foot steps behind me indicated Byron had snapped out of his surprise-induced coma. \n\n“Not cool, man, hand it over!” He urgently pleaded from behind me. I shook the picture until the full glory of it came into sharp focus: Byron’s disgusted face taking in the massive dong as it hung limply in the foreground. I slipped in into my breast pocket. \n\n“Next time don’t yell at my CI.”\n",

        "text": "Cops are people. People make mistakes, show favoritism, and hold grudges. But when those faults get in the way of doing a job the correct way, that’s when things get ugly.\n\nBiggs and I were in our unmarked car, watching our favorite honey-hole for anything resembling a violation of law. The area was well traveled by pedestrian and vehicular traffic alike and was also a known hub for local drug dealers. To pass time, we were playing one of our go-to games while spitting sunflower seed hulls out the window. \n\n“Ok. Mama Fratelli from The Goonies, the mom from Good Times, and that old lady from Golden Girls” Biggs pitched me a softball. \n\n“You’ll have to be more specific than ‘old lady on Golden Girls,’ dude.” \n\nHe amended his previous nomination. “Ok, the oldest one; the little old lady. I think she was one of their moms or something. She had glasses.”\n\n“Ah, you mean Sophia. She was Dorothy’s mom. C’mon, man, get your Golden Girls straight.” I feigned exasperation and rolled my eyes. “Too easy: Kill Mama Fratelli - I couldn’t take her voice, F Sophia because that would be a cool story, and marry the mom from Good Times – Esther Rolle was a classy lady.”\n\nBiggs sighed and thought for a moment as he gazed out the windshield. “Yeah,” He conceded. “That was too easy. Your turn.”\n\n“I’ve been saving this one: Kathy Bates, but crazy a la Misery; Susan Boyle but she can’t make any noise without singing in an operatic fashion; and Katie Holmes but the catch is Tom Cruise has to be a participating third party in whichever one you choose.” \n\nBiggs pondered for a moment but then became irate, “You can’t go throwing all those conditions in, c’mon. Fictional characters are one thing but I’m not getting freaky with Tom Cruise in the same room.”\n\n“No, no. Not just in the room, dude: Participating.”  I crossed my hands behind my head and leaned back in the passenger seat of the Impala, content I had won the battle. \n\n“Well crap… I guess… kill Susan Boyle because that stuff would get old quick, marry - that dude just did a hand-to-hand!” Biggs sat up in his seat but I missed the transition in conversation. \n\n“Who would you marry?”\n\n“No, man, that guy in the red hoodie just sold something to that blue Accord. Hit up Donny, we’ll go for the car.” He slowly crept the car out of our parking spot and merged behind the Accord as it entered the roadway. I went on the un-monitored channel and told Donny, who was lying in wait at the interstate on-ramp a few blocks away in a marked car, what we had. \n\n“Donny: blue accord [state] tag ABC123 heading your way. We just saw them buy a bag. You take lead on the stop, we’ll get ahead of them in case they try and run.”\n\nBiggs throttled the cruiser past the unwitting driver and cut in front of him again. We got into the on ramp for the highway and passed Donny who pulled in behind our target. The Accord jammed on its breaks and swerved a little but was forced to continue on. The driver was looking from the mirror to the road ahead and back again in rapid succession and talking to the passenger we had missed on the initial observation. As we got on to the freeway, the Accord attempted to gun it around Biggs and I, crossing the solid white merge line. We were able to get in front of him, but only just, and Donny came across the radio.\n\n“Guess that’s my PC for the stop.” His blue lights flipped on and the Accord quickly pulled to the right shoulder. Biggs and I stopped just ahead and made our way back to the traffic stop. Donny was already talking to the driver via a three inch gap in the passenger’s window.\n\n“Sir, I can’t hear you. Could you please roll down the window so we can talk?” Donny was quickly getting irritated. \n\nThe driver said something inaudible but the passenger relayed it. “He says he doesn’t have to roll down the window and you have to let us go since you’re violating our rights.” The twenty-something female looked clearly embarrassed and uncomfortable with having to tell off three cops but the driver nodded his head in stern agreement with her statement. \n\n“Well, you can tell - Mr. Thompson is it? Or does he prefer Mr. Thompson, esquire? - that he cut over a solid traffic line with no signal in a manner I’m sure the courts would agree was reckless.” Donny generally had a good demeanor on the street but there were a few things that set him off. A road-side legal dispute with a self-appointed attorney was one of them.\n\nThe passenger listened to the driver and nodded before continuing. “He says you had no right to run his tag and get his name and he doesn’t want to turn over his license unless you admit he is being detained.”\n\nDonny rolled his eyes and stood up straight, stretching his back and blowing a puff of exasperated air from his cheeks before leaning back to the crack in the window. “Yes. Yes, he’s being detained. Now if he could please pass me his license, registration, and proof of insurance I’ll continue with what I have to do.”\n\nA conference took place in the car and eventually the driver acquiesced to the demand, producing the documents requested. Biggs walked up to the window to pick up where Donny had left off when he departed to begin filling out citations. \n\n“Where are you guys coming from?” He asked the passenger. \n\n“The gas stat-“ She was interrupted by the driver’s hand across her mouth. \n\n“We don’t need to tell you anything until we’re read our Miranda rights!” The driver leaned over to interrupt the phone game he had been playing with the passenger as an accomplice. \n\n“True, but I don’t need to read you Miranda unless I’m conducting a custodial interrogation, which I’m not. I was just making chit-chat with the lady. She’s a grown up, she can do what she likes.” The driver sat back in his seat with a scowl and the passenger scowled at him for interrupting her. \n\nBiggs stepped away and leaned in to me. “I got no odor, maybe it was coke?” I knew that was my cue to start a K9 unit our way. I walked back to Donny’s passenger window and leaned in. \n\n“Start a K9 on CAD, no smell but the lawyer’s shaking like a leaf.” Donny nodded and typed a quick message to our dispatcher. She voiced our request on the radio as I was re-approaching Biggs.\n\n“The Niners are ok, but I’m a Green Bay fan. As long as you don’t like the Giants, you’re ok in my book.” The passenger was apparently a football fan and Biggs was poised to talk her ear off with Aaron Rogers’s stats. I’d been in her position before. \n\n“K9-105, hold me en route, 2 minutes off.” The radio spit out. \n\nBiggs and I made eye contact. He mouthed a swear word and walked back to me before shaking his head and placing his hands on his hips. “Well, I guess we can pack this one up.”\n\nK9-105 was well known to us. He had recently transferred from the other side of our jurisdiction where he had built a reputation for being aggressive with drug cases. Even though our area had been several zip codes removed from his, somehow he managed to cross lines with some informants we had cultivated. One thing led to another and eventually K9-105 came to the conclusion we were attempting to “steal” his cases. He held a particularly deep grudge against Biggs for some reason. \n\n“Why him?” Biggs complained. “And why is he so thick headed that he thinks I care enough about his cases that I’d steal them? I could give a rat’s ass about his cases. Hell, he can take ours and I won’t care.” \n\nI could only shake my head, unable to provide an adequate response to his valid points. \n\nA few minutes passed and K9-105 rolled up. Donny was still working on his paper work but he was able to re-position his cruiser so as to take up the right lane of the highway and provide a working area for the dog. The K9 officer approached Biggs and I.\n\n“What do you have?” He asked, avoiding any pleasantries as well as eye contact. \n\n“We saw a guy pass something to these two at the Exxon station back on Main Street. I get no plain smell at the window and the driver’s a wanna-be lawyer, he’ll probably deny consent.” Biggs explained, trying his best to be cordial. \n\nK9-105 leaned to the side to peer at the Accord, eyes squinted and mouth screwed in an expression of doubt. “Number one – always try consent before you waste my time. Number two – my dog gets plain smell, not you.” He then walked back to his Tahoe to retrieve his companion. \n\n“This’ll be fun.” I commented.\n\nK9-105’s partner came bounding out of the SUV, hyper and ready to do some work. His tail wagged as he sniffed the guard rail then lifted his leg on it. The handler clipped his lead to the dog then ordered us to, “Step back. Cujo will bite if you get too close.”\n\nI complied and a second later, Biggs did too, although he did so with some obvious contempt. \n\nCujo walked up to the car and began sniffing the bumper. His handler urged him on with quick jerks of the lead and a low “Seek!” command. The dog circled to the front, then the driver’s side. The would-be lawyer stared at the dog, wide-eyed with a blend of dismay and terror, as it stood on its hind legs and sniffed all around his door. The dog then sat on the hot asphalt, and looked up at his handler expectantly.\n\n“Sweet!” Biggs said, but his exhilaration turned to confusion as the handler pulled the dog away to attempt another sniff around the vehicle. \n\nThe dog obeyed dutifully, circling the car and sniffing all the nooks and crannies before returning again to the driver’s door. The handler wasn’t paying attention and was almost pulled off his feet when the lead met the resistance of the sitting K9. The dog looked to him, then the door, then back to its master. \n\n“C’mon, seek!” Ordered the handler with another jerk of the lead. The dog refused, instead reaching out with both its paws and digging into the door’s undercoat, peels of blue painted spiraling away from its sharp claws. It sat again and looked back to its handler. \n\n“Heel!” The K9 officer ordered, and again, the dog obeyed without hesitation. The duo returned to the vehicle where Cujo was loaded up. \n\nBiggs turned to me. “Well, at least we got the hit. I don’t care if he takes off or helps search but that could have been worse.” He walked to the car and leaned in to talk to the passenger. “The dog indicated the presence of a narcotic inside your vehicle. I think you’d both agree the Supreme Court upholds the plain smell exception to the fourth amendment’s warrantless search provision. I’d ask that you please step out and have a seat over here, one of us will be with you once the K9 officer comes back.”\n\nThe two reluctantly exited the car and took a seat on the guardrail. Donny joined us, clipboard full of citations needing the driver’s signature. “That was easy enough, huh?” Donny asked us, looking back to the K9 SUV.\n\nAlmost as if he had been listening, K9-105’s SUV cranked its front wheels hard to the left and sped onto the highway, driving away before we could protest. “Whoa, wait a minute. Is he coming back? He’s coming back, right?” I asked, jaw dropped in disbelief. \n\nBiggs didn’t hesitate. He jumped on the radio and called out to the dispatcher. “2Alpha60, can you have K9-105 return to the scene. He forgot something.” Dispatch echoed the request and we noticed the dark SUV jam on its brakes and make a dangerous looking U-Turn through the median a mile or so up the freeway. He drove back and cut through the grassy buffer adjacent to us on the other side of five travel lanes. He rolled down his window and threw his hands up in the air, a scowl and frown indicating his displeasure with being recalled. \n\nBiggs and I scampered Frogger style across traffic and met him as he exited his truck. “What! What did I forget?” His voice was full of anger and sarcasm.\n\n“How about the part where you tell us we’re good to search?” Biggs answered, a note of sarcasm present in his voice as well.\n\n“Well, how about the dog didn’t alert. I guess you guys will have to do better next time.” The handler went to get back in his car but Biggs stopped him. \n\n“Dude. I ran a kennel in the Marines. Either your dog alerted on the car or it’s retarded. That was as clear an indicator as I’ve ever seen!” Biggs was closing the gap between himself and the handler, making things a little more uncomfortable. \n\n“Oh, well, if you’re the expert, why don’t you have your dog do a walk around? I’m not going to testify to my dog indicating on that car. Sorry, no search.” He then stormed into the SUV and pulled away, leaving us in a cloud of roadside dust. \n\nBiggs stared at the fading tail lights zooming over the horizon. “What a dick!” We returned to Donny and the couple on the other side of the road. \n\n“Well?” Donny asked expectantly. \n\n“He said no search. The dog didn’t indicate?” I posed the last part as a question because I still was in a state of disbelief. \n\nDonny was livid. “Are you serious?!? I could see it from back in my car! What the hell, man. We need to file a complaint.”\n\nBiggs just shook his head in disgust. “Screw it man, it’s not worth it.” He stalked back to the unmarked and jumped in the driver’s seat. \n\nDonny had the driver sign his tickets then bid him a good night. The driver looked surprised when I told him he was free to go. “You mean, you’re not going to search?!?”\n\n“No, the K9 handler said his dog didn’t detect the odor of narcotics. You’re free to go.” I told him.\n\n“Aw, sweet! C’mon Sadie! Let’s get outa here before the pigs decide otherwise!” He sprinted to his car but stopped short when he noticed his door. “Holy shit! My door! My paint! Who’s going to fix this!!”\n\nI smiled a little inside. “Officer [redacted]’s supervisor can be reached at this number. He might want to think about sending that dog and his handler back through remedial training so he doesn’t harm any other citizen’s property.” I then gave him a quick salute and scampered back to Biggs, waiting in the idling unmarked car.\n",

        "text": "I really enjoyed the variety of people living in the area I patrolled. The melting pot of ethnicities led to several interesting combinations of conflicting cultures and language that, as an officer called in to resolve the disputes, proved difficult to overcome in many cases. \n\nI was just sitting down for breakfast with two of my squad mates, Brandon and Nick. Roll call had ended uneventfully and as usual, we didn’t mark out of service to eat, figuring we should be available in case the “big one” hit. I had just ordered a coffee and was perusing the menu when our radios all sounded a long, shrill tone indicating a high priority event was about to be broadcast. We all tensed, eager to sprint to our cars if the facts of the call required it, and the dispatcher came across.\n\n“1Bravo60, 1Alpha10, start for a burglary in progress. Caller reports he came to his restaurant and discovered several Hispanic males asleep inside. Caller states there is a lot of damage to his property, wants to prosecute. Unknown weapons, unknown drugs or alcohol. Oh-six-thirteen hours.”\n\nShe had sent two of the three of us and the address was right around the corner. We quickly dropped a couple dollars each for the un-consumed coffees and sprinted to our cruisers, elbowing each other on the way to jockey for position. \n\nI made it to my cruiser and was speeding towards to scene, lights and sirens in full effect, before my computer caught up to my self-dispatch request. Brandon and Nick were trailing, but not by much. Traffic was light and we all turned off our sirens as we got within a block or so of the address so as not to spook our quarry. \n\nWe parked and met with the caller, a Korean gentleman bearing an angry expression. \n\n“They always come and mess up my place!” He emphasized with exaggerated hand gestures.\n\n“Do you know who they are?” I asked.\n\n“No, no. They are Spanish people. The Spanish people who live on the street. They are always here. I tell them ‘Leave! Leave!’ but they don’t listen.” He was very upset and pointed to the broken window on the bottom of the dual pane glass door to his establishment, a Korean restaurant in the middle of renovations. “They wrecked the place. Go get them; they need to go to jail!”\n\nI consulted with Nick and Brandon. Ordinarily, this event would be fairly routine. Recently, however, we had been experiencing a rash of street robberies with the local homeless population. The attackers were often armed with knives and the newest rumor was they had access to a firearm. We had been trying to track down the group responsible for several days but had been unsuccessful in our attempts. Just them out lieutenant arrived. \n\nLt. was a cool guy; laid back and open to suggestions, he was just the sort to foster creative thinking among his subordinates. “What’cha got, guys?” He asked as he ambled up to our pow-wow. We explained the situation and our apprehensiveness at just storming in all willy-nilly. He agreed with our concerns and then nodded his head and smiled that smile that meant something awesome was about to happen.\n\n“Well, we’ve all just gone through pepper-ball training, right?” The twinkle in his eye indicated the correct answer was ‘yes, yes we have’ but to be honest, most of us had missed the training day. Nick, however, had been one of those in attendance.\n\n“Duuuuuude… pepper-ball.” He said it with a reverence usually reserved for holy artifacts.\n\n“Hold on, I’ll be right back.” Lt went to his trunk and pulled out the pepper-ball gun. It was basically an unmodified paintball gun but in place of spherical ammo filled with washable paint, this thing shot capsules of powdered capsaicin, the active ingredient in our pepper spray. \n\nHe handed it to Nick like a proud parent passing his newborn for inspection. Nick took it and looked for a second like he might snuggle with it. \n\nI turned to the caller. “Do you mind if we use this to get them out? It’ll leave some powder behind but we’re concerned they may be armed.”\n\n“Will it hurt them?” He asked.\n\n“Yes.” I replied honestly.\n\n“Do it. They mess up my place!” For the first time he smiled a toothy smile and waited for the show to start. \n\nWe slowly made our way to the broken door and opened it using the key the owner had provided. Glass fell and shattered on the cement, giving up our quasi-tactical advantage. We were well covered by the exterior brick wall when Brandon made the announcement.\n\n“Police! Come out with your hands in the air!” He nodded to me, my cue to repeat the announcement in Spanish. We waited but had no indication of movement and tried again.\n\n“Policia! Salga con las manos arribas!” We waited again, and again had no result.\n\nLt stepped up and whispered. “Drag that brick over here to prop the door then pump a couple rounds in. Try and hit that exposed beam on the ceiling to let the powder waft throughout the building. The guy said they were in the back and the only way out is through this door or the emergency exit to the side.” He pointed to our right showing us the emergency door near a bar area, then slinked back to his position in the rear, smiling with his arms crossed on his chest and intent on having a good view of the operation.\n\nNick stepped up once Brandon had propped the door. He slowly took aim and fired three rounds in quick succession, thoomp-thoomp-thoomp. All three hit their mark and a cloud of hateful white powder floated down from the ceiling. Lt walked back to the door and peered in, squinting to account for the change in light. \n\n“I think you’ll need some more. I’ll have Byron bring the other kit from the station along with some more rounds.” He stalked off to make the order. Our hopper was heaping with pepper-balls and the air tank indicated we’d probably be able to fire all few hundred without running out of air, but who were we to argue with the Lt?\n\nWe continued the “announce, fire, wait” shtick until Lt and Byron came up a few minutes later. By that time we had fired about 50 rounds but still had no answer from inside. I figured Lt would call a time out and kill the fun but instead he shoved a gun in my direction. “Bet you can’t hit that pipe.”\n\nIt was on. We turned it into a competition. Byron, who had bragged about playing pro-paintball in college, turned out to be the least accurate of all of us. Nick became proficient enough to make smiley faces on the walls. Brandon and I shot head to head, calling our shots like some perverse game of H.O.R.S.E. Even Lt took a turn, thrumming rounds into the abyss. The property owner stood some distance away but laughed along with us as we made fun of Byron or shot empty wine bottles. Another 50, 60, 70 rounds were expelled into the restaurant. \n\nWe were having such a good time we had forgot about the reason were called to the scene. We were reminded suddenly when a ghostly apparition emerged from the back banquet room. His hands were raised in surrender and the coating of fine, white capsaicin powder was broken only by the tears rolling from his almost-closed eyes and the lines of snot from his nose. He attempted to talk but only emitted a croak before erupting in a coughing fit which continued as he now trotted through the thickest cloud of powder, hands still raised and trembling.\n\nUpon exiting, he collapsed to the ground, a puff of white powder escaping his clothes on impact, and we cuffed him. \n\n“Are there any more in there?” I asked. He tried to look up at me to answer but couldn’t open his eyes long enough for the pain. \n\n“Yes. Two more.” He croaked before another coughing fit.\n\n“Well. Call them out, I guess.” Shrugged Lt. \n\nI stepped up to try but the powder trailed out by the arrested subject caught in my throat. I gagged and backed away.\n\n“Jesus!” Brandon exclaimed. “How are they still in there?”\n\n“Nick walked to the door but learned from my mistake and stood further down-wind. “Come out now and we won’t fire any more powder!”\n\nSlowly, two compliant figures emerged from the banquet room. “Keep your hands up!” Ordered Brandon.\n\nThe figures, barely discernible through the cloud of powder kicked up by their comrade, slowly made their way out. Byron and Nick ordered them to their stomachs and cuffed them while Brandon and Lt took the cover roll. I was still recovering from my deep breath of Satanic particulate. Nick dragged over a hose to begin washing the prone intruders’ faces. The first volunteer to exit was cleaned first, then the two newcomers. We got a good look at their faces and I recognized them.\n\n“Crap! These guys aren’t from the robbery group. These dudes hang out with the drunk crew.”\n\nThe owner walked over to view his tormentors. “Jose! Why you break my window?” He recognized the first man. \n\n“It was broken when we got here, man. I’m sorry Mr. Chung; I thought it would be ok.” Jose had mostly recovered, though his clothing was still coated in the powder. He looked genuinely apologetic. \n\n“Ach…” Mr. Chung scratched his head in thought. “It’s ok. Next time you ask permission. Ok?” The restaurant owner leaned down and pat Jose’s back, a plume of capsaicin rising off him in response. Jose smiled up at him and nodded to him over his shoulder, happy to be forgiven.\n\n“Soooo… you still want to prosecute, right?” Asked Nick. \n\n“Oh no, these guys are good guys. I don’t want them to go to jail.” Mr. Chung seemed insulted we would even think of arresting his friends. \n\n“Ok. What about the restaurant?” Brandon pointed into the building, an atmosphere of dust still floating in cloudy swirls. \n\n“Jose and his buddies will help clean. Right, Jose?” He answered.\n\n“Oh yes, yes, we’ll help, we’ll help.” Jose was raising his cuffs from the small of his back in an attempt to get me to take them off. \n\nAfter running all three and getting no warrant hits I went to Lt who was securing his pepper-ball gun back in his trunk. “No wants.” I told him. “Owner doesn’t want to prosecute now. What do you suggest?”\n\nHe thought for a moment than said, “You know what they say: No victim, no crime. They’re not drunk, yet, so we can’t take them for that. Plus they’re going to clean that crap up. I think that’s punishment enough. And, we did get to practice some slick pepper-ball techniques.”\n\nI agreed and made my way to Nick, Brandon, and Byron who were standing back while the three amigos shook and swiped powder off their shirts and pants. They were all happy with Lt’s decision as well. \n\nSuddenly, Nick whipped around to Byron. “Two bucks says I can stand in the cloud longer than you.”\n\nByron whined, “You have an advantage, man. You went through this crap in the military.”\n\nNick countered, “True. How about if I win, I pay you two bucks. If you win, I take any accidents in your area today.” Nick had possibly screwed up somewhere in the payoff, making the scenario a win-win for Byron who quickly agreed to the bet. Then again, maybe he did if for the team. Seeing those two Neanderthals walk bravely into that fog from hell really made my day.\n",

        "text": "My last ride along story, and if all goes well this summer, I'll be back with some proper stories featuring a new shiny badge in a few months.\n\nWhere I live is a suburb of a major city, and so ride alongs with the metro PD were kind of required, just so that us suburb kids could get an idea of what it's like to work a frantic pace as you roll from call to call.  And 1am on a Friday night on a hot summer's night DEFINITELY scored high on the \"People doing stupid shit\" meter.  After dealing with a DUII accident and a dine-and-dash, the officer I was with got a call of a drunk and disorderly at possibly the most notorious dive bar in town.  This place has a reputation known state wide, not necessarily for violence, but for just being generally scummy in every possible way (It's the only place I've ever been that actually had a C rating from the health inspector).  All you have to say is \"you know, that one place downtown with the missing toilet in the mens bathroom,\" and everyone will automatically know where you are talking about.\n\nAs we pulled up, details from the caller got passed along.  There was a patron inside who was at that delightful level of inebriation where logic, reason, and rationality have long since closed up shop, but aggression and the ability to stand upright for more than 10 seconds were still open for business.  We waited a few moments for another enroute unit to show up, because that's not the kind of bar you walk into alone, especially with a ride along.\n\nWhen the other unit arrived, the two officers got out, and together with my officer had a quick discussion on how exactly they were going to enter.  I was stay right next to the door and make sure it stayed open, a job that I felt comfortable with, because I really didn't want to get any deeper into the place for fear of contracting something horrible and possibly as-yet undiscovered.  It also gave me a great vantage point to see what kind of antics our suspect for the evening was going to be up to.\n\nAnd oh, was he having a grand old time.  As he wandered around the open \"dance floor\" area (probably never been danced on, ever), tipping this way and that like a top-heavy cargo ship, he was yelling incoherently about...something.  I couldn't really understand most of the words, but variations on \"fuck\" came up quite liberally.  He was also ineffectually swinging his fists at perceived threats, most of which seemed to be thin air.  The three officers, in a wonderful demonstration of restraint and training, actually managed to talk this guy down from his drunken air-boxing rage, get him outside, and into cuffs with out any more use of force than a hand on his arm.  Were that more people could see cops do their duty like that.\n\nOnce outside and in better lighting conditions, I could see our new friend's face.  At which point I take back the word \"friend,\" because I knew this guy.  And oh, how well I knew this guy.  His name was Todd, and he had been the bane of my existence in junior high.  If what he had done to me in the two years I schooled with him had occurred in adult life, he'd be up on a list of assault, robbery, theft, menacing, and harassment charges long enough to make even the most cynical judge do a double take.  He had been the bully to end all bullies for me, and had made my life a living hell.  A very, very broad smile covered my face.\n\nAs we were primary and things were busy, it was decided that we'd be Todd's transport to the jail, so my officer got him loaded in the back, took the report from the behemoth of a bartender lady, and got everything in order as we started to leave.  At this point Todd had either sobered up a bit, or at least fought through the inebriation long enough to recognize me.\n\n*I should take this moment to point out that I had changed a lot since Jr High, as I'd gone from 5'8\" and maybe 120 to 6'2\" and 200, plus cut my long metal hair into something more akin to a crew cut.  I'm amazed he recognized me at all.*\n\nA very drunk \"Hey...don..don't Ah know \\*hic\\* know you?\" slurred out of the back seat at me.  I turned around, \"Yes, Todd, you know me.  We went to [Redacted] school together.  You used to hit me in the head with an unabridged dictionary, and you stole my graphing calculator.  Karma's a bitch, isn't she?\"  Todd's bleary eyes got very wide and he looked away from me.  For the rest of the short ride to the jail and the booking process, he kept silent.  Given that I was wearing a black polo, black pants, and sitting in the front seat of a police car, I'm assuming he thought I was a cop, and therefore probably going to take my revenge on him.  While I would never do that in any case, it still felt good for him to know the fear that he'd instilled in me all those years ago.\n\nAfter everything was done at the jail and the officer and I got back in the car, the officer pulled up Todd's record, listing off some highlights.  2nd degree burglary, criminal trespass, 3rd degree theft, minor possession, a lengthy list of petty crimes that showed a life devoid of any contributing value to society.  He was living on the streets, using meth and heroin, and committing petty crimes to fund his habits.\n\nIt was about this point that I realized I was making a huge mistake.  I had felt *good* about Todd having a shitty life.  I felt good that he was sleeping under bridges, using heavy narcotics, and dipping in and out of jail.  And the realization that I was being that callous made me feel extremely bad about myself.  Had I really held on to my adolescent hatred of this guy for so long and so hard that at age 27 I wished that kind of life on him?  Did I truly HATE this guy THAT much, and was that hatred actually worth it?  Good God, what have I become?\n\nI almost asked the officer if we could go back so I could apologize to Todd.  He probably didn't know what I had been feeling during our brief encounter, just a suspicion that one of his past mistakes was about to come up and bite him on the ass very hard.  But to this day, I still feel the need to say something to him.  To let him know that, even though he was an absolute bastard to me in junior high, I no longer hate him.  I pity him.\n\nI've looked for him ever since, every time I'm downtown.  But I haven't seen him, either he's moved away, died, or is just doing a good job of hiding.  Todd, if you're out there, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for hating you for 13 years.  I hope you've managed to crawl out of your hole and made something of yourself.\n\nTL;DR - Met my old bully, felt good about his shitty life, had an epiphany that I was being a bad person for it.",

        "text": "I’m an animal lover. Really, I am. Even though I worked in a highly urbanized area, I still had my fair share of animal calls. Whether it was a rabid zombie-raccoon, a dead possum a dementia patient confused for a baby, or a deer struck by a car, I always dreaded animal calls, sometimes even more than the worst “human” calls. \n\nI was finishing up some paper work with a buddy, parked car to car like we so often did. We were in a quiet park with no one around and I was having trouble concentrating on my accident diagram due to the enthusiasm with which he was recounting a noise complaint he had wrapped up a few minutes prior.\n\n“So I told the guy, ‘I don’t care what you say, I can smell weed in your house and I’ll make sure management hears about it’. Man, was he pissed!” Pedro always liked to get one over on our local gang population.\n\nI muttered an unenthusiastic “Uh huh,” Pedro’s cue to continue while I used the stupid stencil we were issued to draw a rectangle that was supposed to represent a car on my carbon copy accident form. \n\n“So, we’re about to walk out, me and Brandon, and at the front door we meet the dude’s mom! She’s coming in, all fired up and ‘Don’t talk to my baby, get out of my house, blah blah blah, yada yada yada.’ Well, gang banger hears her yelling and comes rushing out, wanting to get back into it!” Pedro’s phone began vibrating during his story but he ignored it until he finished his thought.\n\nI looked up to see if I could figure out who was calling. Pedro lifted the phone up, smiling, and greeted the caller. He began answering some questions. “Russ! What's up man?... Yeah man. It’s easy, don’t sweat it. You just shoot it… Yeah... Maybe get on the radio and let dispatch know in case we get any suspicious noise complaints after… No, seriously, you just shoot him.”\n\nI hoped the subject of his conversation had shifted from the gang member he had been telling me about as he continued. “All you got to do is a basic destruction report later. A one liner… Dude, it’ll take you five minutes… I’m not driving all the way up there, you do it you puss!”\n\nPedro lowered the phone and covered the lower half with his hand. “It’s Russ. He’s got an injured deer, both back legs broken and he doesn’t know how to put it down.” He whispered to me before putting the phone back to his ear. \n\n“Well, call me if you need anything. Good luck man, you can do it!” With that he hung up. “Man, what a nimrod. You just shoot the thing! He’s freaking out about it.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders, glad it wasn’t me. I hated it when they looked you in the eyes while you were sighting them in, almost like they knew what you were about to do. I went back to my report and Pedro picked up where he left off. \n\n“So, gang banger comes storming out, all pissed that I’m ‘yelling at his mom.’ I’m like, ‘Chill dude, she’s yelling at me!’ I tell them both to go inside or I’ll take them in for disorderly or something, whatever. Momma listens, gang banger not so much. He gets all puffed up and is like ‘Bet you aren’t so tough without that badge and gun, holmes.’ Man, that crap pisses me off.” His phone began to ring again and he rolled his eyes when he glanced at it. “Friggin’ Russ! Damn! Hello?!?”\n\nI looked up again, amused by Pedro’s frustration as much as Russ’s ineptitude. “Dude, you just shoot it… In the head, stupid! ... No, not the chest… Well, you could, but you’d need to hit it in the heart… Just shoot it in the head man!” He hung up in frustration and let out an exasperated sigh. “It’s not rocket science!” He exclaimed, shaking his head in disbelief. \n\n“It sucks if it’s your first one. Russ is a city boy; he never had to kill anything before.” I felt like I needed to defend him a little. As if in reply, Russ came across the radio, indicating he’d be discharging a round to put down the deer.\n\n“I guess, whatever.” Pedro conceded before continuing again. “So, dude’s getting all puffed up, chest swelling out and getting closer to me. Brandon’s just standing there, giggling his ass off but I’m getting fired up, y’know? I mean, that’s straight disrespect, man. I can’t let this numb-nuts get one over on me. I’m about to break leather - not my gun, man, my cuffs – when gang banger looks outside and smiles ‘cause he sees his buddy walk up. Now he thinks he’s got the advantage but I’m like, no way, let’s move this party outside.” His phone lit up and began vibrating again. “Are you kidding me?!?! It’s Russ! He can chill for a minute, the big dummy.”\n\n“You sure you don’t want to take it? It could be about the deer.”\n\n“I don’t care. He’s a big boy. Let him figure it out.” Crass, but Pedro did have a point. “Anyway: we get outside and it’s, like, a standoff. Homie who showed up late doesn’t know what’s going down but he’s clearly got the first dude’s back. Dude’s like, ‘You gonna take off the badge, essay?’ and I’m like, ‘No way. I’m getting paid to be an asshole, what’s you’re excuse?’ New gang banger started to laugh and I knew I had to go in for the kill. I go, I say, ‘I’m gonna get you kicked out of housing so quick your mom will be working the corner for the AM shift.’ He was pissed! His boy was laughing his ass off, though. Me and Brandon, we walked away and dude never even had a comeback.” He finished with a big, expectant smile.\n\nPedro was proud of his story but I just stared at him, a look of concern in place of the chuckle he had expected. His expression changed from pride to surprise as his lap vibrated again. I assumed it was Russ and Pedro’s attitude upon answering confirmed it. \n\n“What!!?!... What do you mean it’s not dead? Give it a minute. Sometimes they don’t die right away… Well, did you shoot it?... In the head? … Well, I don’t know. Maybe you missed. Do you see any blood?... Well if it’s got a new hole in it, you hit it, stupid…” He lowered the phone and rolled his eyes again. “Does he want me to hold his hand?” He asked me, loud enough for Russ to hear on the other phone.\n\n“Where’d he shoot it?” I asked, amused at the whole exchange. \n\n“Where’d you shoot it, dum-dum?” He waited then said to me, “The head.”\n\n“I know he shot it in the head, but where in the head?” I countered, forgetting to add my derogatory idiot term. \n\n“Where in the head did you shoot it, you donkey?” Pedro was running out of insults fast. He clearly heard the answer to his question but the slow smile crossing his face indicated something went terribly wrong on Russ’s side of the phone. Pedro’s laugh started as a low chortle but it quickly gained in volume and intensity. He started tearing up and reached over, passing me his phone. “Oh my God, oh my God. My sides! You talk to him, I can’t stop laughing!”\n\nI took the phone. “Yo! Russ. So, where’d you shoot it in the head?”\n\nRuss was clearly reluctant to answer me, especially after the reaction he had just gotten from Pedro. Eventually, he cleared his voice and answered. “Um. I uh… shot it… in the nose. Pedrodidn’ttellmewheretoshootit, justtoshootitinthehead!!” Russ’s reluctant reply got quicker towards the end to make sure he was able to wedge the blame on the still laughing Pedro in the car next to me. \n\nI couldn’t help smiling but was able to stifle a laugh to ask, “What’s that noise in the background?”\n\nRuss hesitated again. “It’s kicking, a lot. Dude, I have no idea what I’m doing.” His voice was pleading now. “Just come kill this poor thing. Please. I’m begging you.”\n\nI was aghast. “Are you kidding me? It’s just writhing there and you’re calling us. Shoot it Russ. In the head, no - in the eye if you can, so it doesn’t deflect off its skull!” \n\nThere was some grunting and cursing then two ear splitting bangs that caused me to hold the phone away from my ear and recoil. I put it back to my ear and waited, listening for any clue as to how the ordeal had concluded. “Russ? Are you there?”\n\nSome shuffling and other assorted “fumbly” noises and Russ was back. He was panting but his demeanor was clearly different. “I got it! It’s dead. No problem here. Sorry man, go back to what you were doing.” I could tell Russ was talking through a big grin. He had done his duty and had some fresh paperwork waiting for him so he was ready to get back to work. \n\nPedro was still laughing, though it had geared down to a silent chuckle every few seconds punctuated by an “Oh, man” every once in a while. I handed his phone back and told Pedro the deer was dead. He wiped the tears from his eyes and then suddenly had a moment of clarity. \n\n“I’ve got to go!” He dropped his cruiser into drive and peeled out of the parking lot, laughing like a maniac.\n\nLater, when I got back to the station, I realized there had been some redecorating. On almost every flat surface, a Xeroxed photo of Rudolph from the classic Christmas movie had been taped up. The only color was a hand dotted splotch of red sharpie on Rudolph’s nose.\n\nPedro stood in the corner of the report room, hands crossed on his chest and a big grin on his face. “You’re a sick SOB, you know that?” I told him. He just laughed.\n",

        "text": "The area I was assigned was notorious for its odd jurisdictional boundaries. Imaginary lines dividing this city from that town seemed to run in random directions and committing them to memory was always a rookie’s first true test as a road dog. There was one intersection in particular that geographically was within my area. The control box, however, was in a neighboring jurisdiction. Unluckily for us, every department in my state seemed to have a different key to access their boxes. It was hard enough to get a copy of your own and trying to get one from another area was impossible. Needless to say, when that particular, extremely busy intersection went dark, it was a good long wait for one of the neighbors to come and help fix it and there was nothing any of my bosses could do to make it go any quicker. \n\nIt was a blistering August afternoon, and Nick and I had been out at the aforementioned intersection for about two hours. We were dripping sweat and our uniforms were soaked through, dampening the day-glow yellow traffic vests we wore over top. A courteous co-worker had dropped off a few bottles of water but they made a very minor dent in the thirst we were experiencing.\n\n“Dude, I’m gonna pass out.” Nick whined to me, back to back in the middle of the convergence of two major roads. \n\n“This sucks. Aren’t we supposed to have rookies for this?” Our agency had been in a hiring freeze so we had been stuck at the bottom of our lineup doing the grunt work for a good couple years. \n\nNick gave the high sign and we both walked forward, blowing our whistles and making direct eye contact with the closest cars in order to both get their attention and make them stop where we wanted them as well as confirm they were planning on stopping at all. We waved through the turn lanes, then the through lanes and met back in the middle, allowing traffic to flow for a minute or so. \n\n“Damn! Did you see that chick in the Miata? She was hot!” Nick’s enthusiasm for the job ebbed and flowed like a reliable tide. “Wanna play punch buggie?”\n\n“No. I just want to get out of here. Where the hell is [the other jurisdiction]? It’s been hours.” I was not as happy with our current assignment and was in no mood to ‘check out hot chicks’ or to get punched by the beefy former Marine. “There’re some pedestrians stacking up trying to get across Main Street. Want to get them at the next change?”\n\n“Sure, after this semi.” Nick replied. The truck ambled by, spewing exhaust at us in its wake, and we sounded our whistles and held our hands up in a pleading “stop” gesture. Once we had everything under control I called over to the walkers to cross. They did, slowly, and thanked us as they got within earshot. We nodded our heads in a ‘you’re welcome’ gesture and once they got across started our turn lanes. Our through lanes waited their turn and once they started going again we met back in the middle. \n\n“I guess that lady didn’t want to cross?” Nick motioned to a woman ambling up to the same cross walk we had just cleared out. She was talking loudly on a cell phone and had a four year old boy by the hand. The kid was happily sucking on a popsicle which was melting down his hand and smeared all over his face. \n\n“I didn’t even see her, did she just walk up?” I asked, annoyed we had one more problem to add to the complicated list of directing traffic. \n\n“Yeah, but not long after the rest of the group. She could’ve hurried but she was too busy yapping on the phone. Guess she’ll just have to wait now.” He gave the high sign again and stepped forward, his whistling screaming in protest to a lung full of air. \n\nTraffic flowed and we met again. “Ok. I’ll get her to go after we stop these cars.”\n\n“Make her wait for all I care. This is BS we’re still out here.” Nick’s enthusiasm had flowed out to sea again.\n\nWe had a silent moment while Nick glared at passing motorists before he stepped forward and initiated our stop-and-go routine. We stopped all the traffic and I yelled at the woman, “OK, COME ON THROUGH!”\n\nShe was a good twenty yards away but I had used my big boy voice. She didn’t acknowledge me. “COME ON MA’AM, YOU CAN CROSS!!” I yelled a little louder. The woman wasn’t paying attention, still talking on her phone. Her son noticed me and yanked on her hand to get her attention. She reacted to that by jerking her hand away and angrily chastising him before going back to her conversation. \n\n“Screw her!” Nick called, and stepped forward to let traffic turn left. The woman would have to wait through another cycle. I let my turn lane go and then allowed the through traffic to start before meeting Nick in the middle again. The sun bore down on us, making the woman’s snub somehow that much more aggravating. \n\n“Want to get some Popeye’s after this? I could kill for some popcorn shrimp.” Nick was fairly random if you hadn’t figured it out yet. \n\n“No, I’m good. I could kill for some water though.” I replied, fried fast-seafood really didn’t sound too appealing at that moment. \n\n“Time to stop ‘em.” Nick stepped forward again and turned red with his effort to out-whistle me. \n\nWe stopped traffic and I noticed the lady had finished her conversation. She was now standing on the curb, glaring at us. We made eye contact and that was her signal. “Are you gonna let me go sometime today? You’re making me late!”\n\nOur left turn lanes were still streaming through but Nick took the lead before my calmer head could prevail. “We gave you your dang chance a minute ago but I guess your stupid phone was more important.” The drill sergeant in him erupted out and I’m sure she heard every word. Her posture and “oh no he didn’t” expression confirmed it.\n\nNick didn’t give her a chance to reply though. He stepped to the middle and blew his whistle for the through lanes to start. “Let ‘em flow!” He yelled to me, and I did, indicating to my lead car to start. We met in the middle. \n\n“Geez, Nick. You wonder why you get so many citizen complaints.” I chastised him. \n\n“Dude. Pay attention or get out of my crosswalk. It’s easy.” He replied. I was about to say something witty but stopped short as Nick’s eyes bulged and he raised his hands. He took a few steps toward me before I turned to see what was happening behind me.\n\n I was just in time to see the woman enter the roadway, still raging, and dragging her kid behind her. Apparently she had decided the brief break in traffic was time enough to make her way across whether we liked it or not. She had failed to properly gauge the oncoming Sentra’s speed however. She cleared it, but just barely. Her son, on the other hand, took to full screeching impact. He was flung into the air and out of his mother’s grasp, falling in a heap several feet away. It seemed to me to happen in slow motion similar to how many describe these traumatic events. I can still remember the spray of the melted Popsicle and the guttural yell I issued forth in response to my total inability to affect the situation. \n\nThe child’s mother screamed and ran to him, scooping him into her arms over our protests. The child was crying, a scrape of road rash marring his arm, shoulder and cheek. Tears mingled with sweat and bright colored syrup on his face and he allowed his sobbing mother to comfort him. “Don’t move him!” I ordered the little medical training I had kicking in. I heard Nick on the radio frantically calling for an ambulance and providing the method of injury to dispatch. \n\nI knelt beside to woman and her wailing child. “Where does it hurt?” I asked, but he ignored my question in favor of expressing his pain with gasping sobs. Nick was still in the middle of the road, spinning in a circle and providing too many details for the dispatcher to make practical use of. He was the father of two little children and was clearly disturbed by what he had just seen. I then noticed the driver of the vehicle stumbling from her vehicle, overcome with grief and already teary. I went to her.\n\n“Are you ok? Don’t worry, it wasn’t your fault. We told her to wait. Sit back down in your car.” The elderly driver nodded she would comply but then raised a crooked finger, pointing back in the direction of the boy and his mother. I looked to see what was happening. \n\nThe mother had stood up with her son, now grasping her and resting his bloody head on her shoulder, snot and Popsicle syrup dripping onto her shoulder. The mother was in a full-on sprint, running through the stopped traffic and in the direction she had initially been headed.  “Stop!” I yelled, but she had already made it across and up the mulched bank of landscaped trees on the other side. She continued her sprint as I jogged after her – her super-mom, adrenaline-induced cardio ability far surpassing my dehydrated effort to catch up. \n\nI watched her continue, still wailing, up the steep sidewalk, past a couple office buildings, and turn out of sight. I was already out of breath and had to just stop and watch her go, powerless to do anything else but update on the radio she had fled.\n\nA minute later the ambulance showed up. They checked out the elderly driver and cleared her, then asked about the kid. \n\n“Uhhh… They ran away.” It sounded ridiculous when Nick gave voice to it but then, that’s what’s happened.  We tended to the elderly driver while the ambulance checked the area before returning to tell us they didn’t find our pair. We took down the driver’s info, re-affirmed with her she was not at all in fault, and saw her on her way before we turned to each other, unsure what to do next. \n\n“I guess we should call for the helo?” Nick postulated. \n\nI shrugged. “I guess; it’s a felony, right?”\n\nLuckily our boss showed up just then. “Well, if she took off with him, let her go I guess. Mother knows best, right?” He said with up turned, ‘I give up’ hands and a shrug. Nick and I were still shaken by the whole incident but boss shook us from our stupor. “Now, get back to directing traffic. [The other jurisdiction] should be here any minute, right?”\n",

        "text": "It's been a few days but here you go. Hope you like it.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n\n\nI always found the hardest aspect of this job was dealing with the unjustified disrespect piled on you by people unwilling to admit their actions had consequences. \n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier post, being dispatched to DUI’s while working day-work was usually not a good thing. If someone is that drunk, to still be going strong at 6:00 AM, you know you’re in for a rough time and that was the case one early summer morning several years ago. I was being sent to a wreck where a female rear-ended a paper delivery person who was stopped at a left turn signal on a busy road. The paper delivery person had called because the female had tried to pay him off before cursing him out when he refused. She had then attempted to flee but struck his vehicle a second time and disabled her car. \n\nAs I rolled up, the version of events as provided by the complainant was immediately verified: The early 20-something girl sitting on the curb was pouting and refusing to make eye contact with me as I approached to verify there were no injuries. Her vehicle, a late model sports car worth more than double my annual salary, was wedged in under the bed of the paper delivery man’s 80’s Toyota pick-up. I went up to the caller first, since clearly I wasn’t going to get any immediate cooperation from the female. \n\n“You ok? Do you want an ambulance?” I asked the shell-shocked victim. He was sitting just inside his vehicle, door still open, and looking despondently at the cigarette butts littering the gutter in front of him. \n\n“I was just sitting here, waiting for the light.” He replied, ignoring my questions concerning his physical well-being. “She just plowed into me, no breaks, no nothing. I was worried she was hurt and she just started… *screaming* at me.”\n\nI told him I’d check on her and to get his license and insurance ready, I’d be returning for them in a minute. I then went to the female, still pouting on the curb. Her elbows were anchored into her knees and her hands cradled her chin. She had been crying, evidenced by the streaks in her thick mascara and foundation. \n\n“Ma’am, do you need an ambulance?” I asked even though she hadn’t acknowledged my presence. \n\n“No.” She said, abruptly and full of spite. “But he might need to go back to driver’s school. Asshole came out of nowhere!” She leaned back and yelled the last part, making sure the other driver heard her.\n\n“Ok. Well, I’ll get your side of the story but give me a second. If you could grab your license and insurance info, I’ll be back in a second with a form for you to fill out.” In reply, she huffed back into her previous pouty pose, making no effort to comply with my request. No matter, I had more work to do.\n\nI retrieved the information exchange forms from my cruiser and requested a wrecker for the woman’s car. I was already suspicious of her level of intoxication due to her demeanor and appearance, and the vehicle was inoperable due to the damage from the accident anyway. I went back to the rear-ended driver first. \n\n“Do me a favor and fill this out,” I said, handing him the form and a pen. “I’ll get them from both of you and then we’ll trade so you have all her info for your insurance company.”\n\nThe man looked up at me, clearly distraught from the combined effects of being in a wreck, being late for work, and being verbally assaulted by a drunken debutant. “You sure she’ll give me her info? She said she wouldn’t before.”\n\n“Yeah, she’ll give it to you. If not, I’ll dig it up and make sure you have everything you need before we get out of here.” I felt bad for the guy, it was a crappy situation. “I’m going to go check on her.”\n\nI walked back to the girl who hadn’t shifted from the time I last left. I attempted to hand her the form and gave her the same spiel I had just made to the other driver. \n\n“Guh, like, no way. I’m not giving *him* my information. Look at him. He’ll show up and rape me or rob my house. He’s not getting anything from me, he caused this.” She rolled her eyes and went back to her statuesque pose. Clearly the lack of designer labels on the paper man’s clothes indicated he was a book she had already judged. Still holding the form intended for her, I just nodded my head and went back to my cruiser, filling out what I could from the vehicle’s DMV return. I was not surprised to find the car appeared to be registered in her father’s name. \n\nAfter filling out the tow form as well as a ticket for fail to maintain control of her vehicle, I returned to the girl. “I’ll need your license to finish up my paperwork. The tow truck should be here soon.”\n\nShe was livid. “A tow truck? For my car? I don’t think so. My dad will come get it. You need to cancel it right now. And my license? Why do I need to give you my license? I didn’t do anything!”\n\n“Ma’am, clearly the other car was stopped at the light. You ran into him. Also, have you had anything to drink recently?” This was getting annoying. \n\n“Exactly! He was stopped at the light. What was I supposed to do?” She stood up to emphasize her stance but her sickly sweet breath was more offensive than her attitude. Clearly she had been drinking. \n\n“Well, if your intent was to go through the intersection, maybe use the correct lane? He was in the turn lane waiting for the light to change.” I pointed to the red left turn arrow to emphasize my point and she took in the scene through a twisted scowl. She looked back to me, angry as ever, and glaring through squinted eyes.\n\n“So?” Was her reply. Quite the debate we were having. \n\n“License, please.” I put my hand out expectantly. She made another dismissive sound indicating her annoyance but went to her car and came back with her ID. Just then the wrecker arrived. “Wait here. I’ll be back with you in a minute.” I told her.\n\n“You’re not towing my car! My father will sue you!” She screamed at both me and the burly tow-truck driver that was walking over to meet me. \n\nHe glanced at her over my shoulder. “Wow, got a winner this morning, huh?” \n\n“Yeah. Could you throw her in the car when you take it away? It would make my job a lot easier.” The last threat had put her solidly into my “dislike” category. \n\n“I could take her off your hands.” The tow truck driver winked at me and nudged me with an elbow. He stared at her again, now more predatory than amused. “As long as you don’t charge me with statutory. What is she, sixteen?”\n\nI shook off the creepiness he just doused me in and realized I had yet to check her age. I looked at her license and did the mental math. “Crap. Nineteen.” I said aloud, not thinking about the creep I was standing in front of who was still staring at her, the fox to her hen house.\n\n“Niiiiice.” He said.\n\n“No, no. Not nice. She’s been drinking and I’ve got to take her in.” I shook my head in despair, resigned to the fact I would be facing a few more hours with that joy of a woman. Have I mentioned before I hated working DUI’s?\n\nThe wrecker driver shrugged and began doing his job of separating the two cars. The truck came free easily and I provided the driver the appropriate information he needed before letting him drive off. The girl was incensed. “Why is he going? He gets to go but my car gets towed. That’s totally not fair.” She folded her arms across her chest and stomped her foot, pouting a pout that would make an only child jealous.\n\n“Well, not that it will help your current mood, but guess what: I’ve got to run you through sobriety too. When was the last drink you consumed?” I knew I’d be talking to an angry brick wall but figured it was worth a shot.\n\n“What?!? How dare you! When my father finds out what you’re implying he’ll… he’ll…”\n\n“Sue me, I know. Are you willing to do the tests or not?” I was getting too fed up to keep up the happy cop façade. \n\n“No. I refuse! I’m not drunk. You can’t prove it!” She turned her back to me and stuck her nose in the air. She muttered some profanities under her breath, presumably about me and my lack of common sense. \n\n“Ok.” I muttered, taking a look into her car before it was towed away. Low and behold, there was an open, half-finished bottle of fruit flavored malt beverage in the center console. Well, there was no backing out now.\n\n“Ok ma’am. If you won’t submit to field sobriety I’ll have to place you under arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence.” With her back to me, I had easy access to her arms. I took an elbow and leveraged her hand behind her back, placing one cuff on before she realized what was happening. \n\n“You can’t do that! You can’t arrest me! My dad will sue the shit out of you. I’m going to own you!!” She raged. She played keep away with her second hand but I eventually triumphed, gaining control and securing it too behind her back. \n\nI escorted her to my cruiser and opened the rear door, “Watch your head!” I lowered her in, still screeching obscenities and thrashing about. After giving the wrecker driver his copy of the tow form, (“Got her in cuffs, eh? –wink-wink nudge-nudge  - Just how I like ‘em!”) and shaking off the willies he gave me, I opened the sliding partition to the back of the cab. \n\n“Ma’am, in this state you’re considered DUI if you are over a .02 blood alcohol level. We’re going to go to the jail where you’ll be tested. If above the threshold, you’ll be charged. Due to the fact you caused an accident, your demeanor, the smell of alcohol about your person, and the open contained in your vehicle, I have probable cause to believe you’re already above that level.”\n\n“Screw you.” She said coldly, after listening to my speech. \n\nWe began to drive away and the verbal assault continued. “You think you’re reeeal tough, huh? Arresting a defenseless little girl?” I ignored her. “Huh? Tough guy? With your gun and… gun. Well guess what; I’m going to sue your ass for false arrest. I’m going to own your house. My daddy has the best lawyer in the state and he’ll make sure I win. You’re going down!”\n\nI continued to ignore her diatribe but decided it would be in my best interest to begin the car mounted camera to record her statements. She didn’t notice as I pushed a couple buttons and continued her onslaught.\n\n“You’d better not touch me either. I’ll tell everyone you raped me if you so much as look at me wrong you sick sonuvabitch. I don’t care what you say, I’ll own you. You should just let me go now.” She looked out the window and made the same exaggerated pout she wore at the accident scene. Then the water works began.\n\n“You’re ruining my life!” She wailed, tears streaming down the already etched rivulets in her makeup. “I’m going to college to become a doctor! And you’re ruining it!” I continued to drive in stoic silence, ignoring her cries from behind me. A few moments passed before she switched tactics again. \n\n“Sir; I know you know I have money. I have $1000 cash in my purse. It’s sitting next to you and you can just take it. I’ll pay my fine now if you let me go.” So now we had disorderly speech, false rape allegations, and an attempt to bribe me, all in one short trip to the jail. \n\nAs we approached the jail’s loading dock, the malevolence came out again. “I bet you can’t even ‘get it up.’ Is that it? You get your jollies picking on girls because you can’t please them in the bed? That’s it, huh?” I rolled my neck in aggravation, cracking the bones in an attempt to alleviate the rage I was feeling.\n\n“I’d advise you not to act this way inside. Once we get through the doors, you’re in the deputies’ world. They won’t take kindly to your attitude in there. If you want to get out of this quick, just stay quiet. We’re not going into a country club.” I exhaled, and exited as she mockingly huffed at my advice.\n\nAs I pulled her out of the cruiser, she was still going at it. “You think I can’t handle a bunch of stupid cops? I’ll own them too. You just wait, I’m going to own this whole pla-”\n\nHer most recent soliloquy was interrupted by the electronic crackle of the intercom, asking if my prisoner was searched and my weapons had been secured. On my confirmation of both, the doors slid open, reminiscent to the gates opening for R2 and C3PO at Jabba’s palace. \n\nWe walked in to the fluorescent light of the booking area and a female deputy approached, asking what I had brought in this most recent client for. Before I could answer, the girl snarled a response. “For driving. And because he can’t get his dick hard!”\n\nI rolled my eyes and the amused look from the deputy told me I had a comrade in my agony. She smiled as she said, “You can put her over there, in the holding chairs, until you knock out your paperwork.” She nodded in the direction and gave me an obvious wink, as though her advice would possibly fix my problem. I nodded back, in confused agreement (you usually did your paperwork while waiting on the breath technician to do their thing) and ushered my burden to the holding area. \n\nNow, at that time, at that jail, all incoming and out-going inmates were held in one central seating area while the deputies sorted out the particulars and argued over who had to process who, et cetera. Cops in the area I worked had just arrested a guy for a nationally famous murder, a guy who everyone in the U.S. at the time would recognize immediately. Due to the high profile nature of his crime, it was decided he would be tried in a different part of the state to draw from an untainted jury pool (in theory). It just so happened that that morning was his transfer date and as we rounded the corner, there he sat – unguarded but handcuffed to his chair, watching Sports Center with rapt interest. \n\nMy prisoner didn’t notice at first. “That bitch touched me. I can’t wait until my dad hears about this. I feel sorry for you, man.” She shook her head in mock amusement and glanced up at the TV. “Can we at least put on something interesting?” She complained to no one in particular. \n\n“No. I’m watching this.” A cold voice answered. My prisoner turned to find the next target of her rage and noticed the murderer sitting a few seats over. She opened her mouth to reply then closed it as her eyes got wide. \n\nThe rest of the booking experience was surprisingly easy. Not a peep of disgust exited the girl’s mouth and she readily complied with the breath test and booking procedures. Shockingly, she blew over the legal limit and was charged with DUI. She was granted a very low bond and was in the process of getting bailed out before I even finished with my paperwork. As I was about to leave, I approached her to give my standard “good luck” speech.\n\nShe listened intently and when I was done called me closer. In a low, secretive tone she whispered, “Am I really in the same jail as [infamous murderer]?” \n\nI nodded yes, and added, “This is where we bring everyone who breaks the law,” before departing.\n\nAs an epilogue, court went as smoothly as the booking process. I met the defendant’s father at trial and expected to be verbally lashed by him. What actually happened was far different: he shook my hand. He actually thanked me for giving his “precious angel” a wake-up call. She pleaded no contest and took her fines like a champ. \n",

        "text": "(Brace yourselves, this one went long)\n\n_____________________\n\n\nOver the course of my career there have been a few exceptional cases where a stronger understanding of the fourth amendment would definitely have helped out the guy on the other side of the cuffs:\n\nIt was an early morning and I had just finished my lap of all the local homeless hangouts, a routine I fell into in which I made sure the regulars were still kicking and not passed out drunk, lying in wait for an unsuspecting storeowner to arrive and think they found a corpse in their dumpster area. As usual, I had found nothing out of the norm and was about to go meet with my group of day laborers when my computer indicated I was instead being dispatched. \n\nIt seemed an “exotic dancer” had called and wanted to file a report against the group of guys that had employed her the previous evening. She told the call taker she was kicked out of the apartment without being paid and wanted an officer to respond to assist her in her civil complaint. I was being sent to meet her, along with my buddy Byron. \n\nWe arrived and met the complainant in the parking lot. She was in a state of disarray to be sure: her hair was shooting out in every direction like a bleached blonde super-saiyan. She had runny mascara weeping down her face and was missing one of her six-inch stilettos, still stubbornly wearing the other although it cause her entire body to tilt to one side. She seemed to sway with the breeze as we approached her. A waft of booze and cheap perfume galloped forward to meet us like a rambunctious puppy prior to our opportunity to formally introduce ourselves.\n\n“The sons-of-bitches kicked me out!” She slurred, thrusting a clammy hand out for me to shake. “I’m Crystal. That’s not my real name. I didn’t just break the law, did I?”\n\nI shot Byron a concerned glance, raising my eyebrows to say “this is gonna be good.”\n\n“No ma’am. You’re good. Tell me what happened.” She smiled and tried to tilt her head to the other side in a coy attempt to be flirty. She failed to account for the stiletto-tilt, however, and gravity almost scored a take-down. Her bare foot shot out and caught her just before she could fall. \n\nShe giggled and apologized for her clumsiness. “These jerks called me last night and I did my job. Dancing only. No sex. That’s wrong. It’s against the law.” She seemed to be re-affirming her stripper manifesto more than assuring me she wasn’t a prostitute. \nTo speed things up, I theorized, “And they didn’t pay? How much do they owe you?” \n\n“Oh, yeah! They owe me three hundred!” She hobbled in a semi-circle, stiletto anchored into the asphalt like a peg-legged pirate stuck in a knot hole on the deck of a swaying galley and pointed to the apartment building she had been banished from. “They’re in there, number T-2.”\n\n“Ok, let’s see if we can get you paid and then call you a cab.” I made my way to T-2, leaving Byron in the parking lot with the party girl, and knocked on T-2. A moment later the door opened a crack and a bleary red eye peered at me from under the still fastened security chain.\n\n“Yes officer?” The guy croaked. His voice sounded like he had just been rescued from a week at sea with no water and his breath smelled like stale cigarettes and vodka. \n\n“Good morning!” I tried to sound chipper, like there was nothing unusual about waking a guy up at seven AM to try and get a stripped paid. “There’s a young lady out front who said you owe her three hundred dollars. Do you know what’s going on with that?”\n\n“Oh yeah, Crystal. She wasn’t supposed to stay here. I’ve got company coming over and she was supposed to leave last night. I guess she got too drunk.”\n\n“Ok. Well… are you going to pay her? I can’t force you too, this is a civil complaint, not criminal, but I am obligated to tell her how to file a civil suit if you don’t. Civil court gets messy.” I was hoping my extra ad lib solved the problem at hand and would allow me to move on to my next adventure. \n\n“Sure, I’ll pay. Sorry she called you.” He closed the door and I heard the chain slide off the door. He re-opened it only slightly wider than it had been with the chain and somehow fit his round body through, joining me in the foyer. That’s usually a bad sign.\n\nHe pulled out a rubber-banded wad of cash from the back pocket of his grey sweat pants and peeled off three Benjamins. I noticed the wad seemed to be lacking any smaller bills. “Will you give it to her? I don’t want to argue with her. If you pay her, you’re going to leave, right?”\n\nWarning bells were sounding but I took the bills and told him “Yes. That should do it. Thanks for understanding.”\n\nI turned to exit and saw the guy slide in to the slightly cracked door thanks to the reflection in the building’s glass door. I met Byron and Crystal, the two involved in a very serious conversation concerning the type of glitter dancers use and its reputation for its tenacious sticking ability on men’s clothing and skin.\n\n“All I’m saying is if you girls would get rid of that crap, a lot of relationships would be saved. Leave no evidence behind, words to live by.” Byron was dead serious, eyebrows pinched in concern but not realizing Crystal had zoned out and was contemplating her toenails on the one shoe-free foot. \n\n“Here ya’ go ma’am. The guy paid up. You want a taxi?”\n\nCrystal accepted the money with enthusiasm but looked curious. “Who gave you the money to pay me?”\n\n“The little fat guy, with the grey pants and wife beater. I didn’t get his name.” I answered. \n\n“Josue paid? Wow. He must really be scared.” She puckered her lips in concentration, forcing the hamsters in her cranium to run double time to figure out how the three bills came into her possession. \n\n“What would he be scared about?” Byron asked.\n\n“Oh. He’s got a ton of coke in there. Like, a ton. I’ve seen him with coke before but there was more last night than I’ve ever seen him with before.” She seemed content with her answer, smiling at the logic she had displayed. \n\n“Coke? Like, the drink?” Byron had missed the clues I had seen in the building so he was a step or two slow. \n\n“Nope. Like co-ca-een.” Crystal pronounced like a native Spanish speaker. “Can I get that taxi?”\n\nA few minutes later, Crystal was waving from the back seat of a yellow cab, leaving me and Byron in the parking lot to consider our next move. \n\n“Dude. We can’t call narcs, this is our case. Let’s get this guy!” He proposed enthusiastically. \n\n“We can’t just barge in there. He’s already hinked out as it is. I doubt he’ll even open the door again. Let’s tell Sarge what we got. I say we knock, if he doesn’t answer we’ll do a good report and let the narcs handle it if they want.”\n\nHe reluctantly agreed and I made the call to the station to brief our supervisor. “Sounds like a plan,” he told me. “We’ve got bare bones staffing this morning though, so be quick about it.”\n\nI told Byron we were good for the knock and we entered the building together. We walked up to the door and paused to listen for movement inside. Nothing. I nodded and indicated Byron should have the honor. He reached out and rapped on the door. A second or two later, the door cracked open again. \n\n“Does she need more? I’ll pay her more if she needs it sir.” Josue spoke through the crack.\n\n“Uh, no. She’s gone. Is there anyone else inside?” I was surprised he answered and even more so that he was still being cordial. I figured I should go ahead and show my cards. “I’m worried there might be some illegal contraband in there.” \n\nJosue’s eyes widened but he said, “No, no sir. There’s nothing illegal in here. You can come in and check. “He closed the door briefly, and then opened it again, unencumbered by the chain. \n\nByron lead the way and I followed, still confused with the ease of the scenario. I looked around his accommodations: the walls were bare, and unpainted.  A table demarked the dining room and the living room consisted of nothing but a leather Lazy Boy and a giant flat screen TV. There were several DVD’s stacked against one of the walls and a group of folding chairs against the opposite wall. A hallway led to a bedroom with a closet and bathroom branching off along the way. \n\nJosue waved us in. “Take a look. The other guys that were here left through the sliding door earlier. Can you hurry though? I have company getting here in a little while..”\n\nByron circled slowly, taking in the lack of furnishing. “Are you sure there are no narcotics in here? No weed, coke, LSD, MDMA, shrooms, Oxys, crack, heroin, hash –“\n\nJosue interrupted the soliloquy. “No, nothing. Please take a look.” He then walked over to the Lazy Boy and sat down. He pointed the remote at the TV and the dark room was illuminated by the colorful set of some news program in Telemundo. \n\n“Well,” I said quietly to Byron, “Let’s take a look I guess.” I assumed the guys that had fled out the back door had taken anything of value and our search would be brief and un-fruitful. Byron started poking around drawers in the kitchen while I kept an eye on Josue. \n\nA few minutes of overly-attractive weather reporters ticked by before Byron called me into the kitchen. He showed me some empty plastic bags, sliced in half with yellowy white powder still on the inside. “And there are a bunch of razor at the bottom with powder on them too.” He told me. \n\nI sighed. It might not be enough to charge (our courts disliked residue cases) but it was enough for me to call sarge again for an update. \n\n“Well, tell the guy what you found and see if he revokes.” Sarge’s advice was more a method to get us back on the street then it was assistance to help build a good criminal case but I did as I was told. \n\n“Josue, come over here for a second.” I called. Josue quickly joined us in the kitchen, an obvious sweat developed on his brow. Byron showed him the bags and told him about the razors. \n\n“Oh that! That’s some bags that had Maza in them. That’s how they sell it at the bodega. I don’t need the big bags. It’s for tortillas. Like my mom used to make. I make them myself. You want one?” He spoke so fast his words blurred together. Byron called his bluff.\n\n“Sure, I’m starving, thanks for the offer.” \n\nJosue’s eyes widened again. He began looking around, hoping some home-made tortillas would materialize to save him from his self-made trap. “Uhhhh… give me a few minutes, I have to make them.”\n\nByron shot me a glance. “Naw, man. That’s cool. Don’t sweat it. Are you still sure there aren’t any drugs in here?”\n\nJosue’s shoulder relaxed and he sighed as he said, “No. I’m positive. Keep looking if you want.”\n\nByron made a skeptical expression but shrugged and went back to poking through cabinets. Josue once again retreated to his recliner, a bouncing bikini-clad volleyball player trying to sell used cars waiting on the screen to greet him. \n\nByron muttered, “It’s still here. I know it. Are you going to help?”\n\nI was reluctant to do so, leaving Josue unattended, but realized Sarge wanted us to clear ASAP. “Ok, you stay in here, I’ll go check in the bedroom. Just keep an eye on big-man, don’t let him sneak upon you.” Byron dismissed me with a wave, confident he had the tactical advantage over the portly Josue. \n\nI walked to the bedroom, passing Josue on the way. He was mopping his brow, sweat now spreading from his armpits, darkening the area under his sleeveless undershirt. “I’m going to take a look in the bedroom. Are you sure there’s nothing there?”\n\n“Uh, yeah, no. Take a look. I’ve got nothing man. Please, feel free.” He punctuated his consent with a nervous laugh as I entered the room. I flipped on the light and took an inventory of my surroundings. The sliding glass door he had previously mentioned was there, dark drapes open slightly and providing a view of a parking lot on the back of the building. There were few clothes in the closet, which I searched quickly. A couple large Tupper-ware bins contained toiletries and documents, some of which indicated Byron had done some jail time in the past.\n\nI peeked out the door and down the hall, checking if Josue had moved. He was still in his chair, staring zombie-like and sweaty at the flickering screen. I continued my search. Several pairs of sweat pants and their corresponding wife-beaters were in the dresser drawers, along with a drawer each dedicated to black socks and boxer-brief underwear. I got down on my knees to shine my flashlight under the bed. I was greeted by an odd object which I pulled out for further inspection. \n\nI picked it up and flipped it around in my hands, trying to puzzle out what it was. The object consisted of a thick acrylic, five sided, rectangular box and another piece of acrylic that was cut into a square and fit perfectly into the box’s open end. A piece of wood was cut to the same size as the sixth side, and a stylized “JML” was milled into it in a loopy calligraphy. “Hey Byron,” I called, “C’mere.”\n\nByron joined me and I showed him what I had found. He was impressed. “Dude! That’s a kilo press! I saw these in my interdiction class. They use them to press kilos of coke for repackaging. I found a bunch of boxes of Baking soda in one of the cabinets too. He’s cutting stuff here. This dude doesn’t strike me as the baking type.”\n\n“I’m not sure, I hear he makes a mean tortilla.” I replied. \n\nWe walked back out to Josue and once again played show and tell. “I’ve never seen that thing. It was under my bed?!?”\n\n“Yeah. Quick question: what’s your full name?” I asked.\n\n“Josue.” He answered quickly. \n\n“No crap,” Byron chimed in. “What’s your full name, dude?”\n\nJosue’s hands gripped the leather arms of his recliner as though it was about to blast off 007 ejector seat style. “Josue Lopez.”\n\n“You have a middle name?” I asked, making sure my scrutiny of the wooden block didn’t miss his attention. \n\nJosue stuttered a bit before adding, “Manuel.” His raspy voice cracked an octave when he divulged that last piece of info, and he quickly diverted his rapt attention back to Telemundo.\n\n“Dude. Where is it?” Byron asked bluntly. “We all know you got something here. Just tell us so you can get on with your life.”\n\nJosue’s head twitched back to Byron. “There’s nothing here man. Keep looking.” He then snapped back to the TV, sweat flinging off his brow like a sprinkler in July.\n\nByron shrugged. “I guess I will.” He shook his head and walked back towards the kitchen. We had been in the apartment for about an hour. I visualized Sarge re-checking the status screen on his computer, cursing us for not being available for the calls stacking up on the busy morning. I decided he needed one more update.\n\n“Tell him you’re going to tear the place apart. If he tells you to stop, get the hell out of there. Narcs can handle it.” He yelled into the phone.\n\n“I don’t think he’s going to revoke, boss. I’ve asked him, like, five times. He basically demanded Byron keep searching just now.”\n\nThere was a pause, then an angry, “I’m coming that way,” followed by a click. \n\n I was still in the hot seat for a stupid wreck Sarge had to document a couple weeks prior. A former military man and stickler for tidiness, he was not one that liked his pending screen getting jumbled. I had been trying to keep my distance in an effort to get back in his good graces and knew he wasn’t going to be happy when he arrived.\n\nByron was bulldogging the search, adamant he was on the cusp of a large seizure. I was still unsure if there was anything to be found but all the bells and whistles were sounding, and my gut urged me to stay with it. Done searching the thread-bare bedroom, I unfolded a chair and sat in the living room with Josue. We watched half an hour of half-naked newscasters on Telemundo before a sharp knock on the door startled us both.\n\n“They’re early!” Josue uttered. He looked to me, an expression of sheer terror on his face. \n\n“It might be my boss.” I replied, the same expression on my face, I’m sure.\n\nSure enough, I was right. Sarge stormed in. He looked into the kitchen at Byron who was tapping his lip with his index finger and scanning his scene again, unable to solve the mystery at hand. “Where’s the guy?” Sarge asked and I showed him to the Lazy Boy.\n\nSarge’s expression softened slightly and he introduced himself, wiping his hand on his pants after shaking the dead fish Josue offered for shaking. “Sir, I’m sure Officer Thompson explained everything to you. They think you have narcotics in this house. They tell me they’ve found evidence supporting their theory. I’m asking you if you’re sure, 100% positive, there’s nothing in here. All we’re doing is asking your permission to search your property for contraband that could put you away in jail for a loooooong period of time. It’s totally your choice. You have a right to privacy here in your own residence and we’re not here to violate you rights. I just want to be sure you are ok with us being here. Are you?”\n\nSarge should have just saved his breath and told Josue to give us the heave-ho. He waited, blinking irritably in the silence while Josue contemplated his circumstances. \n\n“No. I’m sure. You guys can keep looking.”\n\nSarge threw his head back, breathing deeply through his nose and staring at the ceiling. Before he could say anything a laugh came from the kitchen. \n\n“Ha! I found it. Holy crap!! I found it!” Byron was giddy and we rushed, all three of us, to the kitchen to see his discovery. \n\nByron was kneeling in front of the cabinet supporting the sink. The bottom of the cabinet was pulled up and leaning against the sink drain. In the area beneath the false floor, four cubed bricks of cocaine were nestled together, the distinctive “JML” letters visible through the clear plastic wrapped around them. \n\nJosue suddenly looked ill. He seemed to shrink a few inches and muttered, “You found it.”\n\nSarge seemed torn. True, his guys had just found four kilos of cocaine due to the sheer determination of Byron, but on the other hand, we had been out of service for about two hours, a big no-no when calls were stacking up. He gave a frown of approval, if that’s possible, and made for the door, telling us he’d “call Narcs and get them out here.” \n\nI looked to Josue. “Should’ve told us to pound sand, man.” I slapped him on the back and he almost toppled while he stared blankly at the drugs. “C’mon, let’s go watch some Telemundo until Narcotics shows up.”\n\nUltimately, Josue helped with several major drug cases. The “company” he was waiting for was Mexican Mafia, if you hadn’t already figured that out, and he said he actually felt relieved he was getting out of the business. He had been worried for some time that his number was about to be pulled and a hit-man was coming to pick him off. \n\nSarge wrote us up for some award. I tried to back out, saying I was ready to leave five minutes into the search but both he and Byron insisted I take some of the credit. \n\n“Hell, if it hadn’t been for you I would’ve thought that stripper was talking about soft drinks!” Byron admitted. \n",

        "text": "(I've got to double-post today because I'll be out of town on business for a couple days. This story follows [The IA Case](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/24lpjk/the_ia_case/) chronologically and makes good my promise to /u/zukalop and /u/osiris32 to get it down in writing. - &lt;3  E-M-R) \n\n______________________________________________\n\nRoll call was usually a boring affair. Taking place at 0530 hours, most everyone in the room was half asleep and grumpy, trying to keep their eyes open just enough to avoid the ire of the sergeant reading the boards. The day in question arrived like any other: most of us limped in, fully dressed in uniforms and ready to load into our cruisers as soon as roll call broke. There was always a couple motivators there too, decked out in their Under Armor and pounding creatine or Muscle Milk, knees bouncing with a nervous energy and antsy to blast their eardrums with death metal while max-repping twice their body weight on the bench press. I was one of the former; just let me get in my car so I can get a coffee and I’d be fine. \n\nTo supplement our meager pay, some officers routinely worked secondary employment jobs: jobs where a uniform helped maintain order but you weren’t really working as a cop. It’s a tough concept to explain to someone not in Law Enforcement but it’s on the level, trust me. Anyways, there was a secondary job that butted right up against roll call and several of my co-workers took advantage of it. It wasn’t unusual for a guy to come jogging in to roll call, 10 minutes late and out of breath from the rush, to find a discreet place to sit in the back. \n\nThe sergeant was just wrapping up the boards and transitioning to area assignments when he realized we were two people short. His eyes narrowed as he checked and re-checked the crowd before asking, “Where are Stan and Ned?”\n\nWe all looked around for our tardy companions. Stan was a younger officer, known for being late and unkempt. He also was known for his inability to take criticism and as such, he was an easy target to throw under the bus. Ned was a senior officer. He wasn’t a go-getter by any regard, but he was good for bouncing scenarios off of and he was a go-to guy who knew how to fix sticky situations with the least amount of paperwork. I figured I should at least help out one of them.\n\n“I think Ned’s working secondary. No clue on Stan.” I said.\n\n“I thought I saw Stan in the locker room earlier?” My buddy Devon said. \n\nThe sarge nodded at our attempt to justify our squad-mate’s absences and a second later the door swung open. Ned came rushing in and took the first seat he came to. He was sweaty and panting slightly, having obviously just sprinted from his car to shave a few seconds off his already late arrival. “Sorry,” He said, “I passed out during my secondary spot.” \n\nThe sergeant rolled his eyes indicating his disapproval but also that would Ned would be spared any formal reprimand. He began reading off the assignments. He got to Stan and informed us he’d be on wagon if he decided he wanted to show up to work at all. \n\nWe were about to be dismissed when the door crept open a crack. Stan slid through and tried to lean against a wall, surveying the ceiling tiles in an attempt to not draw any attention to himself. It didn’t work.\n\n“Where the hell were you?” The sarge grilled him. “Roll call started twenty minutes ago.”\n\n“I was here. I had to change my shirt because it was wrinkled and I was having trouble with my collar brass.” Stan’s face attempted to convey a puppy dog-like “forgive me” expression as he made his case. \n\nIn a move not typical of his usual brusque manner, the sarge seemed to accept the story. “Next time you’re late I’m writing you up. You’ve got wagon duty today.”\n\nStan accepted his punishment as though he’d been given a death row pardon. “Thanks, thank you, sir. I won’t do it again, sorry.”\n\nWe all got up to leave and Ned opened the door to exit roll call. Immediately, he recoiled as though just bitten by a cobra. “Ah, sweet Jesus! What the hell is that smell?!?!” He collapsed back into the room and pinched his nose with the hand not bracing himself on the wall. \n\nThe stink seemed to be alive and it clawed at my nostrils even though I was a few yards in the room. My squad mates began gagging and plugging their noses with their uniforms, and a guttural “Ugh!” was muttered by more than one of us. We made a quick retreat out a back door through the report room and regrouped in the supervisor hallway to formulate a plan. \n\nSarge took up his supervision duties immediately. “Devon, Brandon – you two start opening all the windows in the detective offices. Ned, Nick – you two find some Febreze or Lysol and go to town. Pedro, you have the rookie job: go see if this is a fail to flush or something worse and get back to me. \n\nThe assigned parties dutifully acted, though Pedro shook his head in dismay and made a sucking sound through his teeth. Sarge was in his element, reveling in completing the task at hand while cursing the lack of ventilation in the locker room just outside the roll call room. \n\nThe locker room was down a hallway which leads to the back parking lot where all of our cruisers awaited us. The ladies locker room and workout room were on the same hall so it was imperative we took care of the situation as soon as possible, both to let our muscle heads process their protein shakes as well as clear the air before the station commander arrived, a female who did not take kindly to offensive “man” odors. \n\n“You think it was a midnight guy?” I asked the sergeant. \n\n“Don’t know,” He said, “but I’ll find out. This is bull. Courtesy flush, man, it just common decency.” Pedro came back, face contorted in anguish by an over-exposure to the stench. \n\n“It’s everywhere, boss.” He reported, half laughing but also looking as though he might cry. \n\n“What do you mean?” Sarge asked.\n\n“Whoever did it sprayed the entire stall. The toilet, walls, floor… it’s like an explosion.” Sarge took the news and patted Pedro on the back, thanking him for a job well done.\n\n“Well. We need to fix this quick. Commander will be in in about twenty minutes or so and I’ll be damned if this gets me into the hot seat. Where’s Matt?”\n\nMatt was another seasoned vet. He was the squad’s crime scene tech and had seen the worst of the worst when it came to gore and devastation. He stepped up, smiling, already guessing what his assignment was. \n\n“Matt, sorry bro, but I’m going to need you to take care of this. I know you’re not a janitor but they don’t deserve being subjected to this. Do whatever it takes and take notes: I want to nail the MF’er who did this. I’ll let you go home when you’re done, no leave charged.”\n\nMatt took it like a champ. “Well, I guess I’ll just need to get to my truck and get some Vicks for my face mask. You want photos?”\n\nSarge thought for second before deciding, “Yes. Yes, I do.”\n\nThe rest of us were dismissed and we chose to exit the front of the station, taking the long way around back to the secure lot to get into our cruisers. As we walked through the clouds of industrial odor eliminator, the rumors started. \n\n“Dude, that was nasty.”\n\n“Who do you think did it?”\n\n“I don’t know but Sarge was pissed.”\n\n“Yeah, glad it wasn’t me, man. That hammer is gonna fall hard!”\n\nWe carried on with our day, content with the ability to breathe fresh air.\n\nA week or so later the horrors of that morning had faded. Roll call was dragging, as usual, and we were readying ourselves for dismissal when Sarge threw us a curve ball: “On to more pressing matters. The film came back from the Stall Explosion.”\n\nHe had our attention and I noticed the guys around me straightening up. “Matt, if you would.” Sarge cleared the floor for Matt, who stood up and cleared his throat as he approached the pulpit. \n\nHe shuffled some papers and began. “Last week we had an act of criminal vandalism in the locker room. Stall number three was the victim of a heinous assault. After donning my Tyvek suit and respirator I was able to gather the following evidence which was further strengthened later via an investigation authorized by Sarge.”\n\nSarge nodded, proud his supervision was leading to results in such grievous matters. \n\nMatt continued. “Here we see the offended stall.” He clicked a wireless mouse and awoke the sleeping projector. A photo of a brown spattered bathroom stall was displayed on the pull down screen behind him. “And, you’ll notice the unusually high trajectory from which the (finger quotes) ‘material’ was expelled.”\n\nSo, the offender was tall. That eliminated Ned. His five feet six inch frame didn’t support the evidence Matt was providing. Stan, however, stood a lanky six-four. \n\n“After a long conversation with the midnight lieutenant, I determined not only does his squad not have a member over six feet tall, but they were all accounted for during the time of the offense: working a fatal accident on the highway. The first unit was arriving at the station as I was finishing the cleansing process in the crime scene.”\n\nOur gazes all started to shift to Stan, our prime suspect from the get-go and the scape-goat identified in numerous car-to-car conversations theorizing about the “incident.” Stan sank in his seat, uncomfortable with our scrutiny. \n\n“Furthermore,” added Matt, “Upon inspection of the trash in the sink area of the locker room, I located perhaps the strongest piece of evidence in my investigation.” He clicked again, changing the slide to a picture of a uniform shirt, crumpled into a ball in the waste bin. “Upon closer inspection I located this:” He clicked again, pulling up a picture of the shirt now straightened out on the tiled bathroom floor. “a poop stain on the rear tail of said uniform shirt.” Sure enough, there on the picture, was more of the offensive, brown spatter. \n\nNow Sarge got involved. “So, Stan; do you have any defense? I think the preponderance of evidence has been vaulted by the prosecution.”\n\nStan began sweating. “I… I didn’t. I mean, I couldn’t… This doesn’t prove anything.” The room erupted in laughter. He was cornered and he couldn’t even own it. \n\n“You know you did it, Stan.” Nick jabbed from across the room. “Just admit it. Be a man!”\n\nStan straightened in his seat, indignant to the accusations. “You can’t prove anything. It’s all over with anyways, guys. Get over it.”\n\nSarge raised his voice over the din of conversation discussing how to punish Stan. “I think we’ve made our case. If you want me to press it, I’ll give the whole squad a uniform audit and locker inspection. I’m sure I’ll find some issues with a few of the guy’s gear. Or, you could just take a week of wagon detail and buy Matt a lunch for his assistance with the clean-up.”\n\nStan crossed his arms and slouched again. He muttered, “I don’t care if you do an inspection.” We all exploded again. \n\n“Just admit it! Damn!” Pedro yelled, his hands thrown in the air in frustration.\n\n“Ok, ok. I’ll take the wagon. Matt, what do you want for lunch?”  Stan gave in, changing his plea from “Not Guilty” to “No Contest.” \n\n“Wendy’s. Hot and Juicy Double. Extra mayo, no pickle. And make it a meal. Large, with a Diet Coke.”\n\nI wasn’t there to see it, but I hope the wagon was too tall to go through the drive-thru. I’d like to think the cashier who rang Stan up that day knew the crime for which he was paying his penance. To this day, he’ll deny he had any role in the great “Bathroom Stall Explosion of 2008,” but all of us in the room that day know the evidence says otherwise.  \n",

        "text": "There are still moments in my career where I have to take a step back from whatever crisis I’m working through and think to myself, “What the hell is going on here?” One such incident occurred several years ago and it still comes up over beers while war stories are being thrown around. \n\nI worked in an area known for its large Central American population. The mostly illegal populace was comprised of a majority of males who came to this country seeking decent wages for back breaking work. They routinely supported several family members back in their home countries and most had an end goal of returning there one day, once they had built a nest egg after years of arduous labor. To save money, it was commonplace to share a single bedroom apartment amongst 12 or so of your closest friends (close as in “also willing to pitch in a hundred dollars a month for 12 square feet of floor space to sleep on”). They usually stayed with fellow countrymen and often grew relationships similar to frat house brothers. \n\nThere was one particular apartment complex known as being the worst of the worst in the area. It was a cause and effect scenario: they cut rent rates to attract more tenants and in return those tenants brought with them their rowdy, drunken nights, hung over, angry afternoons, and ghost town-like mornings while the populace was out searching for day labor. It was no place to raise a family but the roving troops of bachelors made the best of it. \n\nThe above mentioned apartment complex had been getting scrutinized by our Fire Marshall’s office due to a lack of working smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in the buildings. The smoke detectors were an easy explanation – vagrants frequently broke them to prevent the alarms from sounding while they smoked their crack and weed in the hallways. The extinguishers were a more perplexing quandary.\n\nI had just cleared a fire extinguisher theft call at the complex’s leasing office when a passing maintenance man flagged me down. \n\n“They took another one. I know it was there this morning but now it’s gone.” He pointed me to the building where the theft occurred and I dutifully responded, ready to duplicate my previous efforts to document the crime. Sure enough, the shattered glass on the floor confirmed the now empty extinguisher case had recently been raided. There were few other clues so I was about to depart when I heard some very faint, very scared sounding whispers. \n\nThe whispers were in Spanish, that I could tell, but I couldn’t pick up exactly what was being said. I slowly crept to where they were coming from and determined they emanated from a door in the very back of the building. I quietly crept out of the building, leaning out the front door and issuing a low whistle to the maintenance man who was still waiting outside in the shade of a large maple tree. He answered my call and came over to listen to my hasty explanation of what I heard and from where it was coming from. \n\nHe looked perplexed. “But that’s the basement. They’re all locked. I’m the only one with a key.” I told him I’d need to call another unit and that I’d want to check out the basement once my backup arrived. He gladly handed over the key but added, “Just don’t tell anyone about what’s down there, ok?” He seemed genuinely concerned but handed me the key quickly and walked away before I could ask for more information. \n\nBackup arrived (my buddy Brandon,) and I briefed him up on the current situation: I may have found the elusive extinguisher bandit and he was probably trapped in the basement, ripe for us to nab.\n\nWe crept to the door and I put in the key as quietly as possible. I whispered, “Ready?” Brandon nodded that he was, gun and flashlight drawn and ready for anything. I flung open the door and we both shined our lights down a dusty flight of stairs, seeing nothing but some dust motes and a few bent beer cans. Brandon and I nodded to each other, the universal sign that said “Yes, I’m with you - we’re going into the belly of the beast.” \n\nWe crept down the stairs which issued squeaks of protest to our weight, and made our way to the dark landing. The basement was not what I had expected. A long hallway broke off to the right, dim yellow light emanating from several rooms branching off it before finally opening up, several dozen yards away, to a dark room. It was not some place I’d like to be without my trusty gun/light combo. \n\nWe began clearing the rooms and I quickly understood the maintenance worker’s request: sewage, fresh and putrid, seeped from the derelict pipes and joints of the building’s plumbing. Cockroaches the size of my thumb scurried away from out flashlight beams and several dead rodents indicating the rustling sounds we heard in the dark corners were more of their brethren.  I tip-toed over puddles of green-grey liquid, through dried, flaky patches of what I hoped was just mud, and over ancient crusty pornographic magazines left by some unknown pervert years before. Obviously the maintenance guy was wrong about the fact no one had access to the area. \n\nThen we heard it, the same nervous whispering I had heard before. We shone our lights into the chasm at the end of the hall where it was coming from and I yelled “Policia. Venga afuera con tus manos arriba.”\n\nThe squeak of a sneaker on cement meant someone had heard us. “Policia!” I yelled, concerned we might be walking in to an ambush in this dungeon-like hell-hole. \n\nA ghostly white face slowly slid into view and I almost popped off a round due to sheer terror. That apparition was exactly what I did not want to see in a dark basement and it took all my will power not to turn tail and sprint out of the building. \n\n“Alo?” The face said, blinking in our bright flashlight beams. Another face slid into view, owl-like and just underneath the first. \n\n“Jesus.” Muttered Brandon. “What the hell, man? What’s going on?” He bobbed with a nervous energy and used that voice you only hear in situation where you’re sure the fan is about to be pummeled with excrement. \n\n“Venga aqui, policia.” I said again. The first ghost face slowly slid further from the door frame and into the hallway, illuminated now by both our flashlights and the dull amber light emanating from the single bulb in a room to his left. Brandon and I held our position just inside a room on the other end of the hallway, utilizing our door frame as cover as the man slowly walked to us. He was joined a moment later by another man, totally covered in white, and then a third, similarly powder coated. They were all clearly intoxicated and readily gave themselves over to us to cuff and pat down. \n\nWe walked them out and the story they gave us was something to behold: \n\nThe trio had not been having luck finding work at the day labor sites so one of them had decided to branch out and find new employment. One had decided to take up the sale of illicit narcotics and recruited the other two to aid him in his endeavors. They agreed but quickly met resistance from the local pot dealers not wanting someone new barging in to their business. They realized they needed to provide a different product and had settled on Psilocybin – Magic Mushrooms. Being the excellent salesmen they were, they decided they needed to field test some of their product. One of them knew how to jimmy the door knob and get entry to the basement and they decided collectively it was the best place to get out of public view and find someplace quiet to sample their wares. \n\nThe first time they used the drug, they really enjoyed it, they told me. They decided a second run would be just as good and serve as confirmation that they had the “good stuff.” Maybe it was due to the atmosphere of the creepy basement, maybe it was some deep seated fear one them harbored, but the second time was different. They all said they saw ghosts in the basement. In a panic they ran from the basement, smashing the extinguisher case and spraying the pilfered canister’s contents down the stairs at the ghoul. They told me it worked – the ghost stopped its pursuit of them and retreated back to its lair. \n\nApparently magic mushrooms are a tough sale to the Central American crowd because the group had more product than they could move. Instead of ditching it, they decided it was a good idea to take a few more trips to the basement, now armed with fire extinguishers and the knowledge that the stolen safety devices cured any offending ghosts of potential malice. They would preemptively spray the CO2 over their drug fort, drop a few mushroom buttons, and re-apply the fire retardant as necessary. That explained the powder coating they all bore as we exited into the sunlight. \n\nThe apartment complex was grateful to have the offenders identified and banned them from the property. The trio was charged with the larceny and trespass but I was loathe to determine any damage they caused to the cesspool labeled a “basement” and opted to practice discretion with the destruction charge. They had consumed the last of their product and hopefully moved on to less terrifying means of both business and pleasure upon their release from jail.\n",

        "text": "(I apologize in advance for any typos - I'm writing this on my Blackberry during a very tedious meeting.)\n\nMost officers, myself included, begin their careers naïve to the brutal, ugly truths of our modern world. In the academy, they make an attempt to prepare you for exposure to these things the average citizen will never experience. It's not until you're creeping through a dark house, knowing around the next corner you might stumble upon the decomposed corpse of a suicide victim that you really come to terms with it though. This is a story of how I came to terms with one of these dark societal \"truths.\"\n\nIt was an evening in early spring and I was working a midnight shift in a busy area full of pedestrian and vehicle traffic alike. It was one of those nights where the heat of the day stubbornly lingered into the night, using humidity as its weapon of choice to conduct battle against my cruiser's windshield defrost function. \n\nMy computer pinged at me, alerting me to an incoming dispatch, and then flashed the case's particulars for me to peruse before marking \"En Route\" via a keystroke. I was being summoned to a 7-11 for a reported larceny. There was, as usual, little to no suspect information (two Hispanic males) and I figured it would be another routine report, easily investigated, documented, and closed in a matter of minutes.\n\nI arrived a short time later and met with the clerk. As most of you know, every cop worth his mettle is on very good terms with their local 7-11 clerks and this guy was no exception. I shook his hand, he offered me coffee (\"No thanks.\"), and I asked what happened. He gave me the quick and dirty: he was mopping the floor when two men entered. They made their way to the cooler, just out of his view, and took something out. They then walked around to the rear of the store, skirting around his view again, before sprinting out the door, running in the direction of a busy shopping center. \n\nI took notes - Bad guys? Check. Suspicious activity? Check. Proof of larceny? Nope - and thanked him for his statement \n\n\"No sir. Thank you! Slurpee?\" He offered. I declined and attempted to pin down if he knew what was missing as he walked me to the cooler the offenders had visited. Nothing looked disturbed and I noted the cooler contained basic groceries as well as some adult beverages. I asked if there was an inventory of the alcohol and he told me no, there was not. \n\n\"Is there a lot of missing stock? A lot of room that should be filled by bottles?\"\n\n\"No, sir, so sorry. We just baked fresh pizza!\"\n\nI confirmed he had no access to the video, and drilled down a detailed clothing description of the two men in case I ran across then later. I then informed the clerk I couldn't report the event as a crime since we had no idea if they actually stole anything. \n\nHe apologized. \"So sorry. Big Gulp?\" I againdeclined and thanked him for calling before leaving. \n\nI walked back into the chilly yet humid night, glad to escape the case with only a quick update to the dispatched event. An hour passed uneventfully and I quickly became bored. I'm no traffic cop, so when I was bored on patrol, my go-to was business checks or foot beats. Since the area I was working in was very commercialized, I opted to perform some business checks.\n\nI slowly passed by store fronts, noting in my computer the time and location of my tour, and found nothing out of the ordinary. As I pulled to the back of the first big shopping center, my windshield began fogging over again. I fiddled with the temperature settings, adjusting it so an uncomfortable heat blasted me in the face as a side effect of my effort to clear my view.\n\nSuddenly, my headlights lit up two men ahead of me, struggling with each other under the portico of a loading dock. I hit them with my spotlight and they froze, doing their best impression of deer standing in oncoming traffic. They were fuzzy due to the still-fogged window but clearly one guy was bear hugging another who seemed to be trying to escape. \n\nI quickly exited and gave a \"Don't move!\" command. They separated and the male to the rear raised one hand while the other grasped his waistband. That was a no-no from my perspective: waistbands often conceal weapons. \n\n\"HANDS UP!\" I yelled at him while drawing my weapon. If I had just interrupted an assault and now my suspect was reaching for his waistband, I needed to up my intimidation factor to regain control.\n\nThe guy quickly raised his other hand but in doing so, his pants fell to the ground. Odd. I told the \"pants-less wonder\" to turn around and once he did, I holstered up and cuffed him. I then sat him down (pants still around his ankles) and turned my attention to the other man. \n\n\"Are you hurt?\" I asked. He sheepishly shook his head in the negative and I noticed him buttoning his pants.\n\nIt all started to come together at that point, during the awkward silence I created by switching my attention from \"assaulter\" to \"assault-ee.\" I'm sure my facial expression revealed my poor attempt to mask my disdain at what I had just stumbled into but neither party would make eye contact with me long enough to notice.\n\nI had to verify my suspicion. \"So.... You were 'with him?' Voluntarily? You're ok?\" I asked the red faced \"victim.\" \n\n\"Yes. Ees ok.\" He said to his feet, still hanging his head with an uncomfortable half-smile. \n\nI un-cuffed the \"offender\" and he quickly pulled up and fastened his pants. I then truly took a look at his pants.\n\n\"Were you two in the 7-11 about an hour ago?\"\n\nThe \"offender\" looked surprised and lied, \"No. Not us sir. Not in any 7-11. We've been here, promise.\" If we had been playing poker I'd have just taken all his chips. \n\n\"Well, you look like the guys I saw on the video. I guess I'll just have to take you in until I can sort it out then.\" The \"offender\" hung his head in shame after my counter-bluff, indicating I had the upper hand. \n\nThe \"victim\" then piped up. \"Eet was us. We took the eggs.\"\n\n\"Eggs?\" My brain caused my mouth to react faster than my bluffing mechanism could catch up. \n\n\"Si. The eggs.\" He pointed behind us, against a two story brick wall. Sure enough, there was a six pack of eggs, two missing, but the same brand as carried by 7-11.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. Eggs.\" My mind drew a blank searching for a follow-up. \"Why?\"\n\nThe \"victim\" reddened a shade darker and the sheepish smile returned. \"Eggs.\" he shrugged, with no further explanation. \n\nMy confused look and shake of the head prompted him further. \"You know. Eggs... For the...\" He mimed the cracking of an egg and the subsequent dumping of it onto a waist level plane. He then thrust his hips and bit his lip in false ecstasy. \n\nOh God: eggs as anal lube. It was too much to take in so suddenly. My gut reaction was to retreat to my vehicle but I realized I had yet to identify the offenders. From my door I gathered their vitals, confirming they were homeless, and trying not the stare at the ovum carnage strewn about the ground that seemed so obvious now. \n\nI made my way back to the 7-11 and explained what I had discovered (minus some touchier details) to see if the clerk wished to prosecute.\n\n\"No, no sir. I cannot take food from the mouth of the less fortunate. The Big Bites are fresh!\"\n\nRight. Food... I thanked him again and got back into my car. I then hastily drove to some secluded spot only us creatures of the night knew about and tried to think about something, anything, other than gay egg lube. \n\nMy buddy sent me a message asking where I was. I told him and he arrived a short time later. \n\n\"Man! I'm starving. Want to get some chow?\" He asked.\n\n\"As long as wherever we go doesn't sell omelets.\" I told him causing an inquisitive look I failed to acknowledge. There are some dark things best kept secret from the sweet naïve. \n",

        "text": "I worked patrol in an area with a strong military presence. During the last war in Afghanistan, we frequently were called by the spouses of deployed members of the armed forces to help with the type of thing that might have been taken care of by the husband (or wife, I’m not sexist) had they been home. Things like minor domestic complaints involving children who didn’t listen, suspicious vehicles in neighborhoods and unsolicited solicitors knocking on doors were very common. The call that came in one hot summer day was not that run-of-the-mill minor complaint, however.\n\nA woman contacted 911 reporting an unknown male had broken into her house and was found in her bedroom, disrobed and incoherent. She made the call from her neighbor’s house and had her three small children with her. Her husband was an officer in the Navy and was deployed. She let us know he had several weapons in the house and was worried the intruder might be after them.\n\nI arrived with my partner, Biggs, and met up with a couple other officers as well as our supervisor, “Moose” – the 6’8” beast who showed up in another story I posted earlier. We got the layout from the complainant and developed our game plan: Moose, Biggs, and I would enter via the basement along with Pedro, a former military man who had just been issued his AR-15 platform duty rifle and was itching to deploy with it. We felt the long gun was needed in case the intruder had armed himself with items from the homeowner’s stash. We’d have two trailers with us to help clear if needed and another two on rear perimeter in case the guy jumped out a window. \n\nWe announced and entered, making quick work with clearing the basement. We got the main level and Pedro covered the staircase leading up to the last spot the intruder had been seen. We had no contact on the main level and knew what we had to do.\n\nMoose yelled in his most intimidating cop voice, “Come downstairs with your empty hands raised. Otherwise we’ll send up the dog.” The bluff had worked before but we all knew K9 was a good ten minutes out. We waited but got no reply from the top floor, not even a squeaking floor board. \n\nCautiously, we made our way up the steps. We cleared the kid’s rooms and a bathroom before making our way to the master bedroom – its door closed and no sound betraying the presence of its occupant. Moose transferred his sidearm into his weak hand then counted down on his fingers, three, two, one, before tossing the door open. We made a dynamic entry and quickly located the intruder. \n\nHe was asleep on the homeowner’s bed, face down on top of the covers, and stunk of booze and body odor. He was stripped down to his tighty-whities and socks and snoring deeply, his whole body heaving with every breath. He didn’t look like the typical drunken intruder but there was no arguing he was our guy. \n\nWe whispered the next plan: Since he was clearly not armed and since Pedro was the FNG, he was elected to sling up his rifle and approach the intruder while we covered him with less lethal options. We formed up our “tactical L” to eliminate cross fire of the Taser and gave Pedro the go sign. \n\nHe crept towards the snoozing suspect. Slowly he placed the first cuff on, then he second. The intruder didn’t even react, just let his arms be raised and restrained behind his back while Pedro backed off. “What now?” He whispered loudly. \n\nWe looked to Moose who was taking in the scene. “Pat down the covers, make sure there aren’t any weapons, then we’ll wake him and get the hell out of here.”\n\nPedro did as he was told, his face indicating his displeasure at being exposed to the boozy B.O. stench rolling off the bad guy. He didn’t find anything and looked to Moose for guidance. Moose leaned a little closer and boomed, “Get up, police!!”\n\nThe intruder was startled awake and immediately became belligerent. He thrashed and cursed at us, telling us to “Get the F outta mah house!”\n\nMoose told him to calm down, that he was in custody and we would drag him out forcibly if he didn’t want to go easily. Realizing he had no options, defeated and handcuffed, the intruder rolled back onto his belly and sobbed noisily into the homeowner’s pillow. “Pedro, reach over and roll him onto his back, we’re done here.” Moose ordered. \n\nPedro gloved up and apprehensively crawled onto the bed, reaching across the still sobbing intruder’s lower back to grasp his waist. He tried gingerly at first but the girth of the drunken cry-baby was too much. He doubled down and grabbed a tighty-whitey clad hip. He heaved with all his might and the prone intruder grunted in protest. Right as his body crested the half-way mark and Pedro would be relieved by gravity’s assistance, the struggling intruder let loose the longest, loudest, most foul smelling fart anyone in the room had ever experienced. It was a thing that inspired awe, or, in the case of Pedro whose face was almost on level with the offending bodily opening, a stifled vomit reaction. He gagged and retreated, trying to cover his face with his uniform, and muttering an exasperated, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!”\n\nMoose, Biggs, and I couldn’t help but guffaw. The stench quickly filled the room and we grabbed the intruder by the shoulders, dragging his dead weight off the bed with a thud and hurrying into the hallway with him trailing behind. Pedro was still in the room, his tented uniform shirt providing no relief to the onslaught against his olfactory sense. “Go, go, go, go!” he chanted, real terror in his eyes. \n\nWe got the guy outside and into a cruiser. One of the backup officers located the guy’s pants and the wallet within. The homeowner came over, timidly trying to see the intruder’s face without him seeing her. Her expression quickly turned from apprehension to surprise. “That’s Jimmy!” She said to Biggs.\n\n“Who’s Jimmy?” He replied. \n\n“He’s my neighbor down the street. Oh God, I’m sorry Jimmy!” She went to the window but Jimmy didn’t acknowledge her. \n\nJimmy’s wallet verified her ID of him. We opened up the door to ask him what happened. He explained, slurring slightly, that he had taken a taxi from a restaurant to his home and went in to nap. I explained it wasn’t his house, but his neighbor’s and he slowly focused on the address next to the front door. \n\n“Well, shit.” He stated. \n\nIt turns out Jimmy was a semi-big time politician and had recently gone through a divorce. Prior to going to the restaurant, he had been at his lawyer’s office, begrudgingly finalizing the paperwork. Also, his father had just died unexpectedly. We called his recently divorced wife who agreed to take care of him until he sobered up and released him to her custody. \n\nPedro was beside himself, feeling the only vindication to getting a face full of flatulence was to get the felony stat for a burglary arrest. “C’mon Lt., you owe me now.” He whined. \n\nWithout missing a beat, Moose lifted his leg in the direction of Pedro and let loose a wet sounding emission of wind. “Keep the change, Pedro.” He laughed as he walked away to his cruiser.\n",

        "text": "I am not a police officer, but I went on a ride along because I am looking to do a career in law enforcement. On the ride along, we had an adventure. Here goes!\n\nI was riding with an officer not long after dinner time, in a decent sized suburb. It was a warm summer evening, and the sun was beginning to set. Not much was going on and we were just kinda shooting the bull.\n\nThen one of his buddies (We'll call him Roberts) came over the radio, reporting his location. The officer with me (I'll call him Smith) decided to drive over and see what was going on. We pull up to the house, to see what all the fuss is about. There is a small group of kids in a house with no parental supervision. They were shooting BB's from the upper floor, and hit the neighbor's glass door.\n\nThe houses are arranged so that the back yards of houses are connected, divided only by a fence (if that). Well the kids shot the back swinging door (which was glass) and the back window of the house behind them, and the lady calls the cops.\n\nSmith, Roberts, and myself walk up the driveway going alongside the kids house.  No one answered the front door and the door bell was broken, so we moved on to the back yard. We come to the back door, and Roberts knocks on the door. \"Police department, open up\" you know the drill.\n\nNo one answers, because again there are no adults. The back door leads to the kitchen which is dark, and Roberts decides to turn on his flashlight to see inside. Keep in mind, the back door had a doggy door that Roberts didn't notice. His flashlight fell upon a big ol' German Shepherd. He says \"Jesus, that's a big dog!\" The next thing I know, this German Shepherd comes bolting out of the doggy door. Somehow, Roberts was straddling the doggy door just enough for the German Shepherd to run between his legs.\n\nAs you can imagine, the dog is barking like he just smelled Beggin Strips. He comes running out, and Roberts goes into a panic. He moves to the side, yells out some choice words, and whips out his taser. He even hit the button to start zapping, because there was no cartridge loaded into the taser. It made one heck of a noise as he arced it, ready to stun the dog.  He was going to drive stun the thing, but it simply ran off and into the yards of the next door neighbors.\n\nMaybe you had to be there, but Smith and I got an ab workout from how hard we laughed. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I've never seen someone draw anything from a belt that fast. James Bond wishes he could have that kind of draw speed.\n\nWe teased him for a few, and then moved on to another call. I will never forget that experience, and it's one of the funniest things I've ever witnessed. TLDR? Beware of doggy doors with German Shepherds waiting behind them!",

        "text": "I never really had an experienced guy to teach me the ways of advanced criminal patrol – the aspect of the job that really piqued my interest and ultimately provided my current career path. As such, most of what I know was cobbled together by me and some of my like-minded coworkers. The ability to practice discretion with charges naturally progressed to managing small time informants, which lead to an ability to work well and communicate with people, which lead to the ability to think outside the box and approach seemingly unsolvable criminal trends with fresh eyes. \n\n\nSuch was the path which lead to me and a partner, let’s call him Biggs, being five stories above our prey, squatting over an A/C unit with binoculars and radios in a vacant hotel room. We were looking over a bustling shopping center which included several fast food restaurants, a gas station, and large, ethnic grocery store. The shopping center was surrounded on three sides by low income housing and we had been experiencing a rash of robberies, shootings, and stabbings that seemed to be unsolvable. It was a toxic criminal equation of plenty of easy targets who were afraid of police interaction (either due to fear of deportation or from negative experiences in their home countries) and a crime scene that had several escape routes that lead to hundreds of apartments full of persons who’d happily aid in hiding a bad guy from the cops. It was a perfect storm of factors to attract the criminal element from all over the region even before you added in the additional factor: the jurisdictional boundary separating out area from a neighboring department ran right through the middle of shopping center. \n\n\nOur commanders were becoming upset with the crime numbers and had happily agreed to our proposal to conduct surveillance for units that would be hiding just outside of eyeshot from the shopping center. We had explained the situation to the hotel management and they had happily agreed to provide us a room. The hotel itself was on the wrong side of the jurisdictional line but any crime we’d see would be happening inside our own border. We recruited some of the bike team members we were friends with to work as our chess pieces. We agreed to keep them updated on the comings and goings of the potential bad-guys and had the ability to run license plates and conduct rudimentary backgrounds on anyone we noticed that may need more attention.\n\n\nBiggs had worked the area for some time and was very good at recognizing the faces of our usual customers. He also seemed to have a sixth sense for spotting those with criminal intent. Connecting the lines from his intuition to a lawful reason to conduct a stop was sometimes difficult, but it more often than not concluded with good cases and some very bad people off the streets. \n\n\nOur units had just cleared a stop on a prostitute we had spotted and were re-positioned out of eye sight, ready for the next fish. Biggs was on “bino duty”, scanning the gas station parking lot for fresh cars and calling out any tags that sparked his interest. I was lounging on the bed, running the info for Biggs when he provided it, but also enjoying a particularly good COPS re-run on TV. He called out a tag which I ran, the foot chase on COPS holding my interest until the return came back. Sure enough, it was a hot one: the registered owner had a suspended license as well as an extensive history that included drugs and robberies. We confirmed it was our guy via a photo and tried to figure out what he was up to.\n\n\nThe car was filling up but even after it was obvious it was topped off, the owner lingered, paying particular attention to the comings and goings of the frequently robbed gas station mini-mart. We gave the heads up to our pack, providing the clothing description and history of the target. Since he had a suspended license, the stop itself wouldn’t be hard to justify. Our hesitation came with deciding if we wanted to let him get more comfortable and maybe demonstrate if his intentions included attempting to rob someone. \n\n\nWe gave word that if he didn’t move in three minutes, our guys should swoop in and see what he was up to. If nothing else, they would issue a citation to a known repeat offender for a pretty decent violation – proof to our commanders that we were doing some good on their behalf. Our request for the pause was answered by our bike patrol units informing us they’d be ditching the cruisers for their bikes. They also informed us of a special guest – the assistant commander made a surprise visit and was ready to mount up a bike as well. No problem, he’d get to see us in action. \n\n\nThree minutes passed and the guy was acting as shady as ever. He nervously smoked a cigarette (by a gas pump no less, SCOFFLAW!) while scanning the parking lot every few seconds. We gave the go command and saw our guys approaching from the back of the shopping center. Bad guy saw them almost as fast. He quickly flicked away his cancer stick and jumped into his vehicle. He had just pulled out of the fueling stall when they got up on him, motioning him to stop. Watching through the binoculars, I muttered to Biggs, “He’s not stopping. This is about to get ugly, watch.”\n\n\nLike Nostradamus on a clear day, I forecast correctly. The car lurched to one side, attempting to jump a curb but failing to get the traction needed in the slick mud of the median. It then dropped into reverse and pulled away from the bike cops, almost striking a car idling behind. The yells from our four buddies drew us from the window and we flew down the stairs to a rear exit door that lead right to the service road where the drama was taking place.\n\n\nA soon as we burst outside, we saw one of our bike buds jerk the door open, gun in one hand, door handle in the other and face red with fury as he screamed at the guy to show him his hands. The bad guy was having none of it and quickly stood up in the open door, shoving the officer before fleeing on foot. It was on. \n\n\nBiggs and I had momentum to carry us past the car and our stumbling partner as the other bike cops and assistant commander struggled to aim their bikes in the right direction. The “CLINK TING” of falling change rang back from the suspect as he frantically emptied the pockets of his cargo pants. The change turned to cash, balled up ten and twenty dollar bills tumbled into the parking lot as the perp still sprinted ahead. With the top pockets empty he moved to his cargo pockets and began bailing ship. Bud after bud of stinky marijuana littered our path as we still pursued. By that time the bikes had gained steam and had pulled ahead of Biggs and I (starting to feel the stress of the several hundred yard sprint). \n\n\nThe suspect jumped a seven foot chain link fence and was quickly followed by one of the bike cops. By the time I made it there, I was totally gassed, panting and trying to update our location on the radio as sirens heralded the arrival of several back-up units. I was just about to scale the fence when a screeching tire-on-asphalt sound drew my attention to a beautiful sight: the assistant commander had come in to the park area where I stood with too much speed. His momentum carried him into a low wooden fence used to mark the dog walking area and his bike’s front wheel failed to clear it. He went ass over tea kettle, tumbling into the dog crap littered area before jumping to his feet and brushing himself off. He bore a shell-shocked expression as he looked to me and asked, “Where’d he go?”\n\n\nI told him he went over the fence but we had a good perimeter. I then asked if he wanted to wait for K9 who was responding. \n\n\n“Hell no, let’s get this guy.” We jumped the fence and drew our weapons, methodically checking the terrace style apartments and their bush-hidden patios. After marrying up with the rest of the bike guys, we located the perpetrator with the helicopter’s assistance. He was hiding under a kiddie pool on one of the patios. We dragged him out, all sweaty and coated in a fine residue of plant material from his frantic drop of ballast. The assistant commander slapped us all on the backs then grimaced as he brushed some gravel off his road-rashed forearms, the adrenaline giving way to the pain he had been ignoring. “This is why I don’t leave my desk.” He told us as he limped back to his abandoned bike.\n\n\nI asked the suspect why he ran and he replied he was at the gas station to deliver a pound of weed to a buyer. He figured he was set up once he saw the bike cops. \n\n\n“A pound? Out of your pockets? How does that work?”\n\n\n“Dats how I roll!” He laughed back. “My customers expect the best! Straight from the source!!” I was unsure how his sweaty pocket were the source of anything but lint and grubby pennies but just rolled with it.\n\n\nWe made the long walk back to the cruisers, gathering what was left of the weed and cash we found along the way. We only recovered about five ounces and half his cash, still enough to charge a felony but missing enough to keep our homeless population happy for a few days.\n",

        "text": "I had a great squad for a few years. It was one of those one in a million scenarios where the perfect mix of maniacs came together by the grace of God and made coming to work every day a pleasurable experience. We all pretty much grew up together in a professional sense; experimenting with different tactics, using CI’s and the like. Now, years later, I look back and miss those days. Our prank wars were amazing. \n\nI’m sure it was born from frustration, but whatever the reason, the guys developed a method of scolding those squad members who took up more than their share of air time on the radio. Necessary traffic was excusable but some guys really seemed to relish their time in the lime light:\n\n“1Alpha40. Hold me out at the intersection of 7th St and Main on a no injury accident. I’ll need another unit for traffic. We’re blocking the right through lane. Traffic is passing on the left as well as on the service road but we’re going to be a while. I’m going to attempt to push the vehicle out of the roadway but you’ll need to start me the closest available wrecker, one time, for a citizen request tow. We’ll be re-located in the Sunoco parking lot, North West corner. Again, no injuries but make sure to notify schools and Metro so they can re-direct their buses as needed. I’ll be 10-4, 10-6 a while on paper.” \n\nHearing that while sitting car to car with my buddy Brandon would lead to much eye rolling and head shaking. I think he was the first to develop the logical next step: over the tactical channel (a side band we used that didn’t have a monitoring dispatcher) he’d give a long, unmistakable “Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.”\n\nAt first, we didn’t know if the shush was having any effect. After a week or so of employing it, one of the main offenders finally cracked. After a particularly long transmission and subsequent shush, the radio hog came back over the tactical channel, clearly miffed, and said “If you have something to say, just say it!” For some reason, certain loquacious members of the squad blamed innocent parties, once almost erupting into a physical altercation in roll call. Brandon and I knew we had hit gold. \n\nSoon, everyone was shushing everyone, even if they didn’t have a particularly egregious transmission. Brevity became the name of the game for those of us who were the front runners on the trend. I think my personal best was an entire pay period without a peep of radio traffic. The shushing got old quick, but one of my buddies, let’s call him Nick, was slow on the uptake. \n\nNick was a former military man, heart of gold but dumb as a bag of rocks. He was that guy who got the joke a week or so after you told it and the shush trend seemed to finally catch his attention right when we were tiring of it. The opportunity presented itself and Brandon and I couldn’t let it pass. \n\nI was sitting car to car with Nick while we knocked out some paperwork. Brandon was at Nick’s other window, reading a newspaper and a third buddy, Devon, was working on some pointless call, a civil complaint or something, up the street. Suddenly, Devon came across the radio with a particularly annoying bit of radio traffic:\n\n“1Bravo10. Everything’s 10-4 here. I’ll be 10-6 for a while with the complainant. Could you provide me a case number to include the Julian date at your convenience? I’m away from my CAD so you’ll need to voice it so I can provide it to the citizen. I’ll be 10-8 in five to ten minutes, no backup needed here and they can disregard if they were already in route. This event is going to be closed as a civil, no report necessary.  1Bravo10 over and out.”\n\nI giggled to myself, waiting for my prey to fall for the trap. Nick was scratching away at his reports, oblivious to the radio. Brandon was clearly disappointed and to try and salvage the gag, he said, “Man, that was some ridiculous traffic. I thought everyone would’ve learned to be better by now.”\n\nStill nothing from Nick so I added, “Yeah. If anyone needed to be shushed, it was Devon. That was crazy.” \n\nNick looked up, trying to catch up to our brief conversation. “What happened?”\n\n“Oh, Devon just had some stupid long radio traffic. You should shush him.” Brandon said. \n\nEver slow on the uptake, Nick had never been quick enough to be the “shusher,” though he had been on the receiving end more times than he could count. A devilish smile crept onto his face as he realized this was his chance, he was about to become one of the shushers. He pulled his mic off his shoulder, looked to both me and Brandon with twinkling eyes, and keyed up, ushering fourth a long, exaggerated “Shhhhhhhhhhh.” \n\n“Nice.” I said, the plan finally coming together. \n\nA few minutes later Nick’s phone rang. “Ugh, it’s sarge.” Nick answered and gave a few affirmative grunts, an “ok”, and an “I’ll be right there,” before hanging up. He looked crestfallen as he informed us his presence was requested back at the station, for what, the sarge hadn’t said. He dropped the cruiser into drive and drove off. \n\nBrandon and I waited a minute and followed shortly after, hoping to time our arrival to the station in such a manner as to witness the aftermath of our prank.\n\nWhat followed couldn’t have gone better. The entire scenario - Devon making the radio traffic, Nick shushing him, and the sergeant calling him in had been prearranged by yours truly. I had also hidden a camera in the supervisor’s office that Nick entered with a bit of trepidation. Sarge had him sit down and explained he had received several complaints from squad members about the shushing. He was “ordered to look into it” by the commanders as it was affecting morale and that day he had been monitoring the radio traffic and taking note of the offending radio ID. Nick was then informed he was a part of an official IA case.\n\nNick’s body language indicated his guilt as he drooped in his seat. Sarge didn’t relent. “Nick, I don’t think you are the only one doing this. Hell, I bet you were innocent up until today. What you’re going to do is tell me who else is doing this. I need names and I need them now.”\n\nThat was the point where Nick was supposed to tattle on me and Brandon. We were just outside the closed office door, stifling laughs as we listened for the bombshell Nick was going to drop on us and planning to pounce through the door once he had. What happened, though, was even better. \n\nNick said, “Ryan does it. He’s the only other one I know. Ryan does it and I’ve seen him.”\n\nBrandon and I were amazed. To this day, we’re not sure if Nick was being a loyal friend or really was that naïve to think we had nothing to do with the previous shushing. There was an awkward silence in the office. Sarge hadn’t planned on the script varying to that degree. His improv skills failed him and he began to laugh. \n\n“Damn, Nick. You dropped that dime faster than a frat boy making a booty call!”\n\nBrandon and I entered, feigning concern for Nick’s predicament. “Are you ok? You going to get written up?”\n\nHe quickly realized we had set him up, breaking into an uncomfortable forced laugh. “I knew you guys were messing with me. I knew it.” He stood up, beet red from either anger or embarrassment. Between laughs, I retrieved the camera and stopped recording.\n\n“Whatever, I knew you guys were messing with me. I don’t care if you have a video.” \n\nSarge couldn’t stop laughing either. “Call in the guys, we have some roll call training!” \n\nNeedless to say, Ryan was a little disappointed with the speed in which he was given up to the wolves. “I only did it once, Nick. Damn!”\n\nFollowing the “IA Case,” radio shushing was halted by the great Nick/Ryan treaty of 2007. There followed a time of peace among the squad. That is until the much disputed “Bathroom Stall Explosion of 2008” occurred a few months later - but that’s a different story all together. \n",

        "text": "Several years ago I was assigned to a six month temporary position on a task force to aid in the investigation of a series of murders in my jurisdiction. We were split into two teams of a dozen people and our main task was to create and track down potential leads on any suspects matching even a vague resemblance to the criminal profile offered up by the FBI.\n\nMy team divided our area into quadrants with three of us assigned as partners but flexible enough to assist any other group as needed. I was the young buck eager beaver, ready to beat any bush necessary but lacking the acumen to be of any real threat to usurp the lead detective in his role. \n\nOne of my partners was a crime scene tech. She had worked her share of nasty call outs and high profile cases so to her, the task force life was but a minor inconvenience to her normal, hectic schedule. \n\nNumber three on our team was a grizzled veteran known for having an in depth knowledge of the area we were operating in. I had heard rumors about him prior to be up, and was a little apprehensive if not down-right frightened of how he might treat me. As is true in most of those scenarios, I soon learned the rumors were mostly false and he was in fact a great guy. I say “mostly false” because everything I had heard about how he liked to operate in the grey areas seemed to be true. \n\nA good example: While on the task force, a woman called in to say her elderly mother wasn’t answering the phone or door. This was unusual as they met every day at the same time. The kicker was the elderly mom very closely resembled the victims of our investigation. The daughter didn’t have a key – mom always just opened the door for her – but was adamant we make sure she was ok. Mom was in good health and there was nothing we could see through the windows to say she had fallen or was otherwise incapacitated inside. While Pete talked to the daughter, I double checked all the doors and windows on the house, finding all secure and in-tact. I relieved Pete with the daughter while he triple checked the same doors and windows. A minute later he whistled to me, calling, “Hey, c’mere. I found a broken window.”\n\nI was 100% positive the broken window hadn’t been that way before but sure enough, an outward folding, basement window was busted. Pete carefully removed the glass and nodded to me, indicating I would have the privilege of crawling through and unlocking a door. I did and we cleared the house, finding nothing out of the norm. \n\nAs we re-approached the daughter, now shaken since we found a broken window, a car pulled up and out hopped the mom. Pete had a sudden look of concern as I made sure everything was on the up and up with the lady. She had been to a friend’s house and lost track of time. When she learned about the window, she too became concerned. Pete had it handled, though. Within minutes he left and returned with a pane of glass and window putty. He quickly fixed the window responding to the copious thanks of the woman with, “Just part of the job, ma’am.” \n\nAs we walked away, he leaned over and informed me he was upset it had taken him two kicks to bust the window. He usually did it on the first try.\n\nSometime later we were assigned a lead to follow up on. A local homeless guy Pete was familiar with was called in to the task force as a potential suspect. Reviewing his history, I agreed he was a strong candidate. The guy was routinely seen in two of the three areas where the murders had occurred and he was known to be violent. Pete knew just where to find him and we made our way to the guy’s squatting spot. \n\nThe homeless guy was living on the grounds of an old concrete plant in an industrial area. We pulled up to a half shack, half lean-to that I would never have seen had Pete not told us it was there. We got out and approached cautiously. A dog barked at us, heralding our arrival as a dirty man exited a flap serving as a door. His eyes glared at us menacingly and I couldn’t tell exactly what facial expression he had due to a wiry, grey beard. He shook his head and looked away, flexing his fingers before balling them into fists and walking up to his tied-up dog.  \n\n“Don’t come no closer,” He called, “I’ll let him loose.” He pointed to the dog, some part pit-bull mongrel that was clearly not any happier with our presence than his owner.\n\n“I don’t feel like shooting your dog today, Joe.” Pete maintained eye contact with the homeless guy in a stand-off that would be at home in the O.K. Corrall. My crime scene partner was clearly as uncomfortable with the immediacy of the aggression as I was. We thought this was just going to be a normal interview. \n\n“Get outa here Pete. I don’t have to say nuthin’ to ya, I know my rights.” The old man was now holding the dog’s lead, anger emitting from him and not making the situation any more pleasant. \n\n“Sorry Joe, but today you do have to talk to me. It’s either that or you go to jail. It’d be a shame if something were to happen to your shack while you were gone.”\n\n“Screw you Pete. I have permission to be here. The owner knows it. I’m protecting his stuff!” The guy’s anger somehow intensified.\n\n“Oh, I know. I also know I can get your ass kicked out of here in a heartbeat. You think they want a murderer living on their property?”\n\nThe man’s anger subsided slightly to make room for his confusion. “I ain’t kilt nobody Pete. You’re full of it. Y’all get outa here!” He waved me and the crime scene tech away, breaking eye contact with his superior opponent. \n\nPicking up on Pete’s prior line, I added (trying to sound intimidating), “Can’t. We need to talk.”\n\nJoe guffawed and threw his hand in the air as he spun in a circle of frustration. He stomped his feet like a toddler denied a Popsicle, and threw his head back. “Well, get it over with you assholes! Whataya want?!?!?”\n\nPete stepped up, approaching Joe’s personal space. “I think you’re a murderer, Joe. Why’d you do it?”\n\n“Do what?!?! Are you kidding me? You can’t put nothin’ on me. You don’t know nuthin’. I ain’t kilt nobody!!”\n\n“I think you did, and right now that’s all that matters. You’re going to give me a DNA sample to prove it and you’re going to do it happily. You’re a dirty scumbag murderer.”\n\n“SCREW YOU PETE! I AIN’T KILT NO ONE. YOU HEAR ME!?!?” \n\n“Give me a sample then Joe.” Pete was now face to face with the lunatic, calm as a clam, eyes squinted in determination and hands balled into fists at his sides. \n\n“I AIN’T GIVING YOU SHIT! YOU AIN’T GETTING MY DEE-AND-AY! I SAID I AIN’T KILT NOONE!”\n\nJoe spun away from Pete’s intimidating figure and stalked off, turning to his dog, “C’mon Red, let’s leave these pigs alone outside to walla’ in the mud.” He pulled the dog from its stake and dragged it inside while it still snarled and barked at us. Pete looked to us and gave a faint smile before casting his squint eyed gaze back to the hole in the metal wall that served as Joe’s window. \n\n“Wait for it…” He whispered. A few seconds later, Joe’s head popped out the window to see if we had left. \n\n“GET OUTA HERE YOU FILTHY PIECE O’ SHIT!!!” He yelled before hocking a huge wad of spit in our general direction. \n\nPete’s hand whipped out towards the crime scene tech as he yelled in his best approximation of a surgeon requesting a tool, “Swab!”\n\nShe complied and Pete stepped forward, kneeling and dipping the swab into the gleaming loogie before re-sheathing it and handing it back to the tech. \n\n“Was that so hard?” He asked Joe as he turned and walked back to his car. \n",

        "text": "I was pushing a cruiser one day, early in my career, and having a normal morning: school crossing, coffee break, and a couple of traffic stops – basically nothing to write home about. About mid-morning I was dispatched to back-up my neighboring unit, Ryan from the “Crazy Town” story I posted, to a suspicious event. We were being requested by the sheriff’s department to respond to a high rise apartment to assist with an eviction. This might seem mundane, but right off the bat I realized something was amiss. \n\nDeputies in my jurisdiction attend the same academy as the police and are granted full police powers after graduation. It becomes a bit of a point of pride among them to not need police assistance since, at least on paper, they too are police. I had been trying for weeks to get the deputies to allow me to assist in evictions, knowing they routinely ignore charges they come across while lawfully in the evictee’s residence that I would happily charge and bulk up my stats, making my supervisors lay off me about a lack of traffic citations (to this day, I refuse to write traffic). \n\nRyan and I arrive and he has the same inquisitive expression as I do. A little background on him: Ryan and I attended high school together and while there, played the same position on the football team. Ryan was a year older than me and, more importantly for clarification of our relationship, about 100 pounds of muscle heavier. To put it bluntly, Ryan knew he could push around me, a younger, smaller teammate, and prove to our coaches he was the alpha male. Fast forward 6 years and I have been on the job for 3 years, a freshly promoted first level officer on a day-work squad at one of the busiest stations in the jurisdiction. Roll call comes around and in walk the new batch of rookies. Wouldn’t you know it, in the back of the line stomps in Ryan, my former football field nemesis. He was trying to be respectful (6 months in the academy of \"holding up the wall\" for senior officers and push-ups if you didn’t use “Sir” or “Ma’am” when addressing anyone will break a guy) and not making eye contact with anyone. Clearly, the rumors of rookie hazing had gotten through to him and he was trying the “hide in my shell until it’s over” approach. Well, I was having none of that. \n\n“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Ryan. Who’s the rookie now?” The utter shock on his face was all the satisfaction I needed and I forgave him his years earlier transgressions. \n\nBack to the story: We approach the unit and meet a deputy in the hallway. He looks genuinely concerned and paints the picture for us: the deputies showed up to kick a former government contractor out of his apartment. They were warned by management the guy was a little off his rocker and may have weapons. When they approached the door, they noticed it was propped open with a metal ammo box. A sign was taped to the door that said, in crude black marker scribble, “Welcome officers. Come on in.”\n\nRyan and I approached and verified everything they had said. Being the slightly senior guy, I told Ryan the plan: we would knock, wait for any noise, knock again and announce that we were the police, wait for noise once more, then enter the unit and clear it nice and slow. He agreed and we went through the steps with no response from inside. \n\nWe slowly crept in with our guns drawn; me followed by Ryan, followed by the two deputies (who had probably not cleared a room since the academy). I motioned the deputies to cover a long hallway while Ryan and I cleared the kitchen and a dining room, and then passed them to start clearing the two bedrooms and bathroom down the hallway. There was already an eerie feeling from the door and sign but it only got stronger the more time we spent methodically searching the apartment. \n\nAfter finishing up the last room and not finding anyone, I started to look around a little more carefully. There were beer cans littered on the floor in the main living area. Pornography was strewn on the couch and a chair and an empty pill bottle lay on top of a piece of paper with the same scribbled writing as was on the door. It read “Dear Officer. You won’t find me here in the living room. Check where I spend most of my time.” Underneath was a sealed envelope that I put aside for the moment. \n\n“Spends most of his time?” I wondered aloud. I went back to the bedroom on a hunch and looked again at the unmade bed. Sure enough, under the pillow another letter: “I slept my life away because you assholes took my job. You make me want to PUKE!” I looked to Ryan as we both noticed the underlined and capitalized “puke.” We quickly made our way to the bathroom. Under the toilet seat was another letter.\n\n“You’ve taken all I had except for one last place.” Hmmm, Cryptic. I asked the deputies if they knew if the guy had another house or family. As far as they knew he didn’t. That left only one other “place” a person could own in our area: his car.\n\nAt the time we didn’t have DMV ability to look up all vehicles listed to a subject and the management office didn’t have a record of any vehicle the guy might have owned. The only option left was to check the large parking lot to the rear of the building on foot. Taking into consideration the fact we might be walking into an ambush, I asked the deputies to scan cars while Ryan and I covered our front and rear and our group slowly walked down the parking aisles of the lot. \n\nIt seemed to take forever and we got more than our fair share of puzzled looks from residents making their way into the building from their cars. Finally, at the back of the parking lot, we found a running conversion van. A hose ran from the tail pipe up and in to the driver’s window. The gap left by the hose was covered in duct tape and it was clear what we were seeing. I quickly pulled open the door and found our “prize.” He was slumped over, bright red skin mottled and lighter at the folds. An empty case of beer was on his lap and crushed cans were strewn all over the cab.\n\nHe had no pulse and I told as much to the deputies and Ryan. That’s a crappy privilege of this job, finding the poor, lonely and depressed soon after their departure from this plane. I silently wished I had found him sooner but also knew I had no control over the will of others. I contacted my supervisor, recounting the whole story, and he started our homicide and crime scene sections in our direction. \n\nRyan and I were assigned the interior security, blocking the front door of the apartment from any would-be nosey neighbors. As is common in our line of work, we quickly tried to come up with something to relieve the sorrowful scene we had just taken in. \n\n“Pepper spray’s really not that spicy, you know.” I told him.\n\n“Shut up, that stuff’s terrible. I can still feel the burn from the academy.” He replied.\n\n“No, really. Once you’re exposed to it you build up a tolerance pretty quick. Watch.” I pulled out my can of OC, put my finger just off to the side of the spray nozzle and pushed down the button for a millisecond. The small amount of OC that trickled out never touched my finger but I pretended it had. I placed my finger into my mouth and sucked the non-existent offensive liquid from it before saying, “See? No problem. It’s like tabasco. I haven’t even been sprayed since the academy.”\n\nRyan contemplated my OC, my finger, and my earnest expression for a moment. I quickly added a jab, “No balls if you don’t.” \n\nHe couldn’t let a challenge go, not without losing some of that “alpha-ness” he still grasped to from high school. He drew his OC, spayed a stream onto his finger, paused to look at me again, and then licked it off. \n\nHe gagged and sputtered, whimpering “It tastes like spicy metal!,” as his face turned bright red.\n\nI shook my head in mock disappointment. “Stupid rookies.”\n",

        "text": "My dad was a cop for 28+ years and one of the big reasons I came into this line of work. I joined the same agency he was working for when he was already a supervisor and by the time I was getting my feet under me and making my own cases he had promoted through to the command staff level. He constantly joked that “the only thing he policed anymore was the paperwork on his desk.”\n\nIt was a cool experience having him there, another confidant to bounce my frustrations off of but who had an utterly unique point of view. We’d meet for meals while our shifts overlapped and once we even had the opportunity to run lights and sirens together to an officer in trouble call – an experience not many fathers/sons can brag about. On to the story:\n\nWe were celebrating my parent’s anniversary (my wife, young son, mom, dad, sister and I) by piling into their minivan and going out to a restaurant. The place they chose was just outside my beat but within the jurisdiction I worked and I was quite familiar with the area. \n\nDinner was good but uneventful and as we left to file back in to the van I got a phone call from a confidential informant. I recognized the number and before answering the call went through the rolodex of cases I had asked this guy to assist me with. Sure enough, the informant had info on one of them; a cocaine dealer with distribution and felony assault charges out for him had been spotted in the informant’s neighborhood. \n\nAfter getting the info, I half-jokingly suggested we go conduct surveillance since it was nearby, and \"see if we can get a bad guy locked up.\" To my surprise, everyone was for it, adding it would be like a ride-along and my dad would like to see some “real police work” for a change. Though my judgment probably should have steered me to another option, I knew this guy was slippery and a danger to the community. I figured we’d be in the distance, serving as eyeballs until a couple patrol guys arrived to take care of business. It was the kind of thing I knew I’d be into if I was the cruiser-pusher getting the call: a hot case with good warrants and an undercover to help you succeed? Sweet!\n\nI called up the district where I worked and asked the desk sergeant to pass my cell number to an area unit who would be able to help out. He did and in a few minutes I was briefing a relatively new cop, eager to help and taking any suggestions I gave. First and foremost, I told him, get another couple units rolling. This guy had already been involved in many foot pursuits and got away each time. He clearly knew he was wanted. The rookie got on the radio and made the request. To my chagrin, one of the backing units was a more experienced, let’s say *jaded* patrolman. He was the type who knew everything and was going to be upset that I messed up his evening of running RADAR and harassing skaters for some actual work. Equally unfortunate was the fact he was closest to the scene, closer even than the cop I was coordinating with. \n\nKnowing we were getting near the area the bad guy was last seen, I hung up and called back my informant, asking where, exactly, he had seen the wanted person. He told me the guy was in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived, throwing a football with a couple other guys. My dad was driving and sure enough as soon as we pulled in, there was my target, laughing with his buddies and throwing wobbly spirals in a wide spread triangle. We parked and I called back the cop I had been initially talking with. It was an interesting scene, sitting in the car with my family, most of whom had never experienced a stakeout before; a palpable tension thick in the air. \n\nThe bad guy decided to move out of our line of sight and my dad figured he could easily sneak a little closer to reestablish visual contact. As we crept up the parking aisle, everyone including my two year old son with their rapt attention to the lawn area where we had last seen the target, the bad guy popped out from between two cars, chasing the football, and made eye contact with my dad, then my mom (who was in the front passenger seat) then me. I had been leaning in between the two front seats, phone to my ear and giving up to the second updates to my on-duty assistant. \n\nI give the guy credit; he definitely had some quality criminal intuition. After he broke our awkward gazes, he quickly nodded to his buddies, tossed the ball back to them, and without a second glance at us, got in an old Honda Civic. He backed out of his parking space and went deeper into the complex. We followed initially but I had my dad stop at a round-about and turn toward the entrance we had used minutes prior. I didn’t want us to get trapped by this guy deep in the neighborhood and knew there was only one way he could use if his intention was to drive out: the one we were headed to. We parked close to the ingress/egress and I prodded the cop on the phone to hurry. The bad guy came by a moment later, not noticing us backed into our spot between two work vans, and exited onto the major road just outside the complex. We filed in behind him while I gave instructions to the cop to update all the other units via radio that we were mobile. He did so and, lucky me, jaded cop voiced up and said he was right behind our van. \n\nI told the cop on the phone, “Hurry, this guy is going to screw this up.” Sure enough, a few seconds later, he passes us, hits his lights while cutting off my dad, and pulls in behind the target. I got that feeling in my gut that told me this was not going to end well as the bad guy slowed for a red light. He paused, clearly trying to decide what his best escape scenario was, and gunned it, turning left through the red signal through traffic, followed closely by the jaded cop and, much to my surprise, us in our dad-driven soccer-mom-mobile. \n\nWe turned onto a side street, still busy with traffic, and the bad guy stopped abruptly. He rifled through his passenger seat, shoved something into his pocket, and was out the driver’s door fast as lightning. The jaded cop was fumbling with his radio mic as I jumped out of the van, yelling back to my family, “Stay here!” and took up pursuit of the drug dealer. The jaded cop was right behind me and right behind him? You guessed it: my dad.\n\nBad guy hurdled an 8 foot chain link fence. I had run out of my flip-flops (not the best tactical decision for a foot pursuit, I know) and scaled it behind him. Jaded cop got hung up on it and I saw my dad trying to shove him over as bad guy and I rounded a corner, out of their line of sight. We ran onto a football field in the midst of practice. Dozens of elementary school aged kids were decked out in too-big safety pads while their dads watched on from the side lines. \n\nI was starting to feel my all-you-can eat Korean barbecue dinner and was getting gassed. I called out, “Help, stop that man, Police!” but the dad’s ignored me. Inspiration hit me as I remembered where we were (the “Barrio”) and I again yelled out for assistance, this time the first thing that came to me in the foreign tongue I knew might assist. “Ayudame! Violador!” (“help me, rapist”) as I pointed to the fleeing male. The dads all dropped what they were doing and joined me in my chase. We weren’t gaining on him by any means but were still close enough to see him dive into some thick brush in a section of woods behind the apartments where our pursuit had taken us. \n\nBy this time, I was out of gas. It had been a half mile sprint with no shoes and my feet were feeling it. I told my pursuit-mates to spread along the tree line but to be careful since I didn’t know if he had a weapon or not. By this time there were sirens and in the distance I could hear the approaching helicopter. I was eventually relieved from my sentry post by a uniformed officer and made the trek back to the van, thanking the \"dad posse\" profusely along the way. I met up with my dad back at the fence. He had gathered my shoes and was smiling. \n\n“Where’d you go?” I asked?\n\n“[Jaded cop] got stuck on the fence, ripped his crotch out pretty good.” He chuckled. “I figured I’d stay with him and help update on the radio.” He put his arm on my shoulders as we walked out the street, me still panting and sweaty from the pursuit. We got back in time to hear the update over a cruiser radio that the dealer had been caught, spotted by the helicopter and bitten by a K9 when he refused to come out of the culvert he was bedded down in. \n\nMy son was amazed. “Gampa’s Frozone!” he yelled. I can only assume he meant to refer to me as Mr. Incredible, but he was distracted by our laughter. My mom smacked my dad and scolded him for leaving everyone there in the van. My wife was slightly annoyed as well, but happy we caught the bad guy. \n\nAs my dad dropped us off at our place that night, he thanked me for the best anniversary gift he had gotten in a long time. \n",

        "text": "Working the day shift, you rarely get any DWIs. The ones you do get, however, are usually epic. \n\nMy old squad had a Sunday morning ritual where we would all meet together at a certain restaurant in lieu of roll call. We’d head to the station, change out, jump in a cruiser, and be seated by 0530, ready for some delicious bacon and pancakes. The unwritten rule was no one would mark out of service for breakfast; rather we would all monitor the radio and depending on the call, “volunteer” the rookie to go or make the guy whose area it was in take care of business.\n\nOne particular morning I had just sat down, coffee waiting for me and the waitress knowing to bring me my usual. We were hucking it up, busting balls as only good buddies can do, when the dispatcher came across the radio, calling my designator. Crap… I answered up (of course accompanied by the mandatory dumbass doing his best German shepherd impersonation in the background) and she asked if I was available for a call. I rolled my eyes and looked around, hoping someone would step up to plate and take a bullet for me. Crickets were heard playing their sweet, lonely song somewhere in the distance. \n\nReluctantly, I told her I was available and stood up, dropping some cash to cover my part of the bill and telling one of the guys to get my food packaged, I’d eat it later.  I got in my cruiser and had the dispatch message waiting for me, a DWI in the predominantly Hispanic area I worked. It was about six AM at this point and I knew there was no good to come from this case but made my way there. \n\nI was greeted by a jovial, 40-something Central American fella, immediately apologizing for hitting a parked car on the street and obviously intoxicated. I spoke enough Spanish (out of necessity for my area) to run him through field sobriety tests. He failed all in spectacular fashion and was generally apologetic about that as well. It was one of those arrests where you know you have to do it, but you kind of felt bad for the guy – not because he didn’t put the community in danger, clearly he had, but more because he was just a nice guy. \n\nI informed him of my intention to arrest him and put him in cuffs (more “Sorry, sorry” from him) and got him in my car to take to jail for the breathalyzer. I’m sure others have run into this, but at the time it was a near miracle if you could find a breath technician who worked on day shift. Most were midnight officers working over or recently transferred and still had their certification. The half hour trip to jail was filled by messages back and forth with dispatch, praying we could find someone. \n\nLuckily we did locate a tech, a rookie who had been trained during her stint on midnights and had only changed to day work that pay period. She met me at the jail and helped bring my guy in. I caught him ogling her, his drunken libido showing itself. She was in her early twenties, blond and in shape, a good looking girl, and I guess the guy had a thing for a strong female presence. He got all smiley with her, apologizing for anything he might have done to upset her in the 2 minutes or so he’d known her, and staring at her with impunity whenever her back was turned.\n\nShe walked him through some of the administrative paperwork and he gladly provided any answer he could in his broken English, dropping several “So be-yoo-tee-fol, I’m sorry” lines into the conversation. He was smitten. We finally got to the part where he had to blow into the machine and she explained in the slow, measured English you might use for a small child, elderly person, or drunk, sex-crazed Hispanic guy. He nodded along to all her instruction, smiling as he stared her in the eyes, forgetting I was even there. She passed him the tube and he took it. She said, “Ok, when I so go, blow.”\n\nHe nodded again and she pushed a button or two. “Go!”\n\nHe just smiled back. “Blow!” She urged. He seemed confused, suddenly realizing I was the only one present who could help fix his angel’s sudden predicament via translation. \n\n“Como?” He asked me. \n\n“Blow.” I said, “Sopla lo.” He was still confused. He looked back and forth between me and the breath technician and missed his window for a sample. The tech got frustrated, a deep sigh indicating such as she pushed a couple buttons on the machine again.\n\n“This will be your last try. If you mess it up you’ll get an additional charge, you understand?” She slowly and clearly asked him. He nodded in agreement and uttered another apology.\n\n“I’ll push the button again,” she said, “and you’ll have to blow.” She pantomimed holding the tube and putting her lips on it while exhaling a deep breath. “Got it?” She asked.\n\nHis eyes were big and he was smiling as he looked to me for confirmation of what he was just instructed. \n\n“Si, sopla. Aspira profundo y sopla.” I told him while mimicking her example with my hand. He seemed to accept it, but was a little more confused by my version. He nodded and readied himself, taking a deep breath or two and sitting back in his chair. \n\n“Sorry.” He said, nodding his head in a resolute manner, not wanting to upset his siren again. She pushed a few buttons and said, “Here we go. BLOW!”\n\nHe took a deep breath, looked once more to both of us like a proud puppy that had learned to sit and stay, and placed his lips over the tube. He slid his lips up and down on it. Closed his eyes and increased the speed of his bobbing head. He slowed looked up to both of us while he still had the phallic, black tube in his lips, and bobbed again enthusiastically. I was dumbstruck.\n\n“N-no. What… what are you doing?” The tech did not comprehend what was happening. I couldn’t help but stand up and walk away, laughing hard and drawing the attention of some of the booking deputies who took in the scene in all its glory. The tech was leaning away; repulsed by the act the guy was performing for her. He was now half smiling, still bobbing away, drool dripping onto his hand but apparently as enthusiastic as ever. She stood up and walked away leaving him, eyes closed, still fellating the machine. \n\n“Just charge him with refusal.” She said in disgust, and she stormed away looking slightly ill. I looked to the poor Romeo, only now realizing he had blundered and would not get to share his white picket fence or two and a half kids with this potential female companion. \n\n“Sorry!” He called out to her, eyes drooping sadly.\n",

        "text": "I apologize that my stories aren't from the point of view of a law enforcement officer, just from a ride-alongs, but since they're entertaining and the situations recognizable to all of you in the profession, I figure you'll get a kick.\n\nThis story comes from late 2007, when the Interceptor Charger was starting to get picked up by agencies everywhere.  I was riding with my local county sheriff, one of the lucky departments that was asked to test the Charger in the field.  They were awfully proud of that fact, and wasted no time in outfitting 11 of their 12 brand new toys in the white-with-green-stripes livery.  The 12th one, however, was a thing of beauty.  Hematite grey, tinted windows, nice rims, recessed lighting, all of the latest-and-greatest hi-tech gadgetry, it was every hero cop car rolled up in one awesome, unmarked law enforcement package.  And this was what I was getting to ride in.  The senior sergeant I was riding with was well known to me, as he did some part-time training with the CJ department at the college, and was a generally laid-back guy.  Except about that car, that was *his* baby, and you'd better treat it with respect, dammit.  He would brook no mistreatment of his chariot.\n\nIt was a graveyard shift, about 4am.  No one around, the radio quiet.  We'd answered a call to take a report on a residential burglary earlier, but since then all we'd done was drive around, looking for DUIIs and talking about football.  As we went down [REDACTED] road, a residential  arterial, we see a set of headlights come over the crest of a rise and heading towards us VERY fast.  The posted limit here is 30, and this guy is trying very hard to double that or better.  The sergeant slows the car down, reaching for the light controls.  His eyes off the road for just an instant.\n\n***WHACK-KTSSSHHH!!***\n\nBoth our heads whip around, to see that the left-side mirror is now gone.  The mirror with the built-in flasher unit.  The mirror on the sergeant's personal baby of a patrol car.  The mirror that probably costs about $900 to replace.\n\n\"Oh, hell no, you son of a bitch!\"\n\nThe sergeant cranks the wheel over, the banshee-wail of the back tires drowning out my well-controlled \"eeep!\" of shock and surprise.  The big V-8 then shows us that the 340 hp DO come as advertised as we roar off after the suspect, the lights on the car now shining like a Christmas Tree of justice.  We can see the taillights of the suspect in the distance as he speeds away, but in essence we have him trapped.  This section of road doesn't have any direct outlets, just cul de sacs and narrow residential roads that lead off into the labyrinth of suburbia.  He can't get out of the area without extensive local knowledge, or waiting until the road ends in the small town to the north where he can access the highway.  The sergeant gets on the radio, calling in the chase and asking for the small town PD to get units over to the end of the road to block the guy off.\n\nWhat we didn't count on was the suspect being as fast as he was.  He got to the end of the road just as the first city unit was arriving, and was able to get around him on the sidewalk, shoot down the onramp, and hit the highway.  His little red BMW opens up on the empty 2-lane divided, figuring he can outrun the notoriously slower Crown Vics.  What a surprise we must have been for him, for not only were we keeping up, we were gaining.\n\nBut now he's trodden on sacred soil, the soil of the State Police.  The radio starts crackling to life with the sound of state units coming to the pursuit.  The county is starting to mobilize as well, since this guy seems intent on turning out nice little slice of residential paradise into the Monaco Grand Prix.  I manage to pry my eyes off the road long enough to glance over at our speedometer.  Does that say 130?  Jesus.\n\nBut the suspect isn't done yet.  He takes a corner precariously, his back end stuck out like some pro drifter, even though he takes out a DO NOT ENTER sign and several small reflectors, and heads on to the Interstate.  The whole world is awake now, as State, county, and several municipals that line the interstate are getting into this.  I'm listening as roadblocks are being set up on off ramps, the big city department to the north is trying to get it's air unit up (which isn't theirs, it belongs to a news station), and state is trying to get a spike strip set out in front of the guy.  Meanwhile, we're passing big rigs left and right, blowing through the local towns so fast they seem to stitch together into one long, dark blur.  The car is feeling it's oats, a steady howl coming from under the hood as we gobbled up the asphalt.\n\nI went back later and paced it out in my car.  18 miles, from the highway to the end of the chase.  We covered that in 8 minutes.  It didn't feel like 8 minutes, it felt like an eternity and an instant at the same time.  While 130 is fast, I don't think I should have been experiencing relativistic effects, should I?\n\nBut as I alluded to, the chase ended.  State got a unit with a spike strip out in front of the chase, which he hit coming off a shallow corner and going slower.  All four tires, too.  He swerved back and forth several times, eventually spinning to a stop.  If it had been a narrower road he would have hit something.  But that wide open expanse allowed him to come to a halt without trying to occupy the same space as some other object, smoke coming out from his ruined tires and under the hood, perfectly centered in the glow of a street light.\n\nWe screeched to a halt, the car seeming to pant with the exhaustion of it's recent run.  \"STAY IN THE CAR!\" the sergeant bellowed, as he jumped out and drew his duty weapon.  Like I could move anyway, my right hand was death-gripped on the door handle and the other to the arm for the computer shelf.  Other units started to pull up as well now, representing about half a dozen different agencies.  The guy is surrounded, rifles, pistols, and shotguns trained on him, a commanding voice on a loudspeaker telling him to show them his hands.  I could see him in his seat, his hands locked on his steering wheel, head swiveling left and right as he looked at all the gun barrels pointed at him.  There was a pause, I could tell he was weighing his options.  I wondered if I was about to watch someone die, either by his own hand or suicide by cop.\n\nBut no, he took the smart option.  Surrendered peacefully, with barely a word out of his mouth.  As he was walked past the car, I got a good look at his face.  Pale, eyes wide, sweating profusely even in the epilepsy-causing flashes of the lights.  He looked like he'd just seen the faces of God and The Devil at the same time, and they both looked like him.\n\nThings had settled down, now.  The scene wass secure, suspect in custody, everyone accounted for and no injuries/accidents.  The sergeant came over and asks if I wanted to watch them do the search of the vehicle.  I say sure, but it's going to take me a moment to detach myself from the parts of the car I'd now pressure-welded myself to.  He laughs, and helped me to my now rather-shaky feet.  WOW, now THAT'S an adrenaline rush!\n\nThe search goes quickly, as there is next to nothing in the passenger compartment other than an empty McDonalds bag and some random car-related items in the glove box.  The trunk, on the other hand, held a more interesting kind of item, for there were several large freezer bags of what turned out to be black tar heroin in there.  Well, that explains why he tried to get away, at least.\n\nIt's now close to 8am, we're blocking off two of three lanes of an interstate at rush hour, and I'm supposed to be in class at 9.  But we're not done yet, not by a long shot, but the rest is boring and procedural.  There's still a HUGE report for the sergeant to write on this, plus I have to give statements to the lieutenant and someone from the state police.  I was supposed to be dropped off at home at 6am.  I wasn't released until well after 11.  At least my CJ instructors understood why I was late.\n\n**TL;DR** - We saw him rollin', we were hating, patrollin' and caught him ridin' dirty.",

None. Nada. Zip.\n\nKnow why? Because after I set the ground rules straight, they were honest with me. And I believe that teaching kids to be 100% honest and truthful with cops is more important than anything else I can think of right now.\n\nSo here's how part of it goes.\n\nI recently heard that some homeless kids were sleeping in a park in my beat on a regular basis. So tonight I decide to drive through so I can figure out who these kids are and where they belong. I drive my Explorer Interceptor (Oh yeah...I'm stylin'!) onto the sidewalk, and down the path in the park.\n\nAs I approach the first large playground structure, which resembles a large plastic tree/tree house, I hear something. I throw my spot light up into the canopy are of the play structure and see a couple of heads moving around. And then I hear Bang, Crash, Boom, Flinka, well you get the point. At first I thought for sure they were all running from me, and I start to get the pit bull on a chain reaction. Feet itching to go, go, go. But then I realize the noise I heard was a glass bottle, a large one from the sounds of it, being dropped off the structure, and hitting the metal on the way down.\n\nI saunter on up the jungle Jim, and find two young ladies and a young man sitting in the structure. I believe around this time they whisper a united \"Fuck.\"\n\n\"So, being discreet is not your forte?\" I inquire. \"Huh?\" He responds. I advise him that the bottle hitting every metal surface on the way down did not help him conceal his hiding place. I then go on to tell him that if that bottle broke, and my kid, or any other kid slit their foot open on broken glass, I would hunt him down. But, I look over, and the bottle is whole. Lucky him. There is also a Mickey's 40oz on the jungle-jim between them.\n\n\"Who threw the bottle?\" I ask. He looks around, from girl to girl...\"Well, see. We, uh, I mean, not that, well. Okay, I guess, I mean...\"\n\n\"Ok. Stop right there. Let me start off with: I'm Officer Forensicunit. I've worked here for 7 years. I love this area because of the mall, and the kids. In fact I just got done dealing with kids over there. And they all know me. And they all know I have one rule. Don't Fucking Lie To Me. Okay? Don't fuck with me, don't lie to me, don't jerk me around. That is my rule. So, I'm gonna forget what you said and start over. Who threw the bottle?\"\n\nThe boy tells me he did. The one girl then tells me she has more alcohol in her bag. I pull out three empty Smirnoff Ice bottles. The other girl allows me to search her purse, and I find a small glass pipe. She tells me she forgot it was in there.\n\nThen we start to talk. They are begging not to get tickets. I tell them that's possible, but I need honesty from them. They tell me where they got the liquor. Interestingly enough, from a store. With out fake ID's. b There is a store that sells to minors. Good to know. They tell me where they drank, how much, and with whom. They tell me anything I want to ask.\n\nSo when the parents show up, I spin it for the parents and tell them I'm not writing tickets because I believe the parent can affect more punishment, and have more influence, than I can. (I really do believe that by the way). I tell them, no ticket, handle it in house. The I spin it for the kids and say the ONLY reason you aren't getting a ticket is because you were honest. Do you understand that? That is the one and most important thing you need to take away from here. I am not in jail, because I told the truth.\n\nNow, hopefully one of two things will happen. These kids will remember the cop that gave them a break for being honest, they will never commit crimes again, and they will be upstanding members of society. Or, they will falter again, and have police contact again, possibly for something more serious, and they will tell the next cop the truth, from the beginning because last time it kept them out of trouble. Either way, win for me.\n\nBasically, I believe in building bridges, not burning them. And citing every person for every thing you can does not build good relationships. Giving people a chance, and rewarding behavior that is positive, even in negative situations, builds bridges.\n\nOh yeah, six more kids know my name. And they wont forget it. And they'll remember....you don't lie to me",

        "text": "My agency has a policy concerning at-fault accidents where if you get three within a three year period, you get a day without pay along with several other, much less financially devastating consequences.  \n\nI had, at the time of this story, gone through my first two strikes and was doing well in avoiding that dreaded third wreck. I was assigned to a midnight squad but, due to a hiring freeze, was still the FNG and as such was routinely \"volunteered\" for working over with the frequently short day-work squad. This was one of those days and I was dragging. \n\nI had just finished taking my third accident report and finally had the opportunity to purchase some artery clogging breakfast from a drive-thru. We were still hand writing all our paperwork at the point and by the time I had found a place to park and find some quiet, my cruiser looked like an accountant's desk during tax season. There were papers and food wrappers and office supplies anywhere I could find a clear square inch of work space and I was going to eat before sorting through all the paperwork (priorities). \n\nThe beautiful Spring morning beckoned as I rolled to a shady spot in an abandoned Moose Lodge parking lot. I rolled down my windows to allow a breeze in and keep me awake as I began drooling over some protein between two halved biscuits.\n\nRight before my first bite the breeze turned into a gust, passing through my car with a vengeance. It sucked all my half finished reports, notes, and completed citations as well as my breakfast rubbish right out my driver's side window, sending it tumbling all over the parking lot in every imaginable direction. \n\nAny one lost document would probably mean an embarrassing call to a driver who would most likely be angry at me for our earlier interaction and not too eager to giver me an insurance policy number again. Freaking, I jumped from my car and did my best manic shuttle run to gather the papers. I had nearly all of them but realized one last sheet of notes was tumbling a few feet away. It was lodged against a tree so I casually walked over, confident I'd diverted a disaster. \n\nFrom behind me came an odd noise: a satisfying crunch of plastic and metal that at first didn't register. I scooped up the paper and turned to walk back to my cruiser but it was not where I had left it. Down at the bottom of the small decline I had parked on I found it, resting against the only cement enclosed street light in the entire parking lot. In my fervor to save my paperwork, I had forgotten the importance of the \"P\" on my transmission shifter, instead leaving my noble steed in \"D.\" \n\nIt had rolled the 200 feet, Ghost Rider style, and rammed the column of cement at the base of the street lamp. The odds of it meeting that obstruction versus coasting into the large, grassy field in any other slightly modified vector had to have been astronomical and, I won't lie, I think I teared up a little at my perceived injustice of the situation. \n\nI reluctantly called a supervisor with a simple, \"I've had a wreck.\" It took a good amount of explaining to paint a clear picture of how, exactly, I wasn't \"operating\" the vehicle during the wreck but was still at fault. \n\nNeedless to say, I made the most of my mandatory day off that followed.",

        "text": "One of my buddies, we’ll call him Ryan, had this happen the other day and gave me permission to use it here. \n\nIn the area we work, there is a homeless shelter that’s a constant pain in the rear. There are fights, drunks, civil complaints, and petit larceny reports on a daily basis. But, worst of all, this place is a Mecca for mental patients. Usually it’s not a big deal to the staff as they’re used to dealing with these folks, but when they do call it means whatever unlucky sap gets dispatched there is in for a treat. \n\nInevitably, the call comes in and Ryan is dispatched. Staff at the shelter wants a female removed who’s being disorderly amongst the other guests. He arrives on scene, backed up by a senior guy who knows if this gets ugly, Ryan has the paper. They walk through the door and are greeted by the facility manager and points out the problem child: a 40 something, white female who looks like she took a few too many drags from a crazy straw. She’s erratically looking around, muttering insults to no one in particular, and lounging in the middle of the living area. All the other residents are giving her space, some glaring with obvious distaste but not wanting to get kicked out of the place due to fighting.  \n\nRyan knows it’s all on him now. He approaches the woman, introduces himself and asking if everything is ok. The lady turns her attention to him, looks him up and down, and says, “We going, or what?”\n\n“Where do you want to go?”\n\n“The hospital. I need more meds.” She goes on to indicate she’s a frequent customer of our local mental hospital and has decided that day would fit her busy schedule to make a appearance. \n\nRyan realizes this will solve the problems, and, as a voluntary admission, he’d just have to drive her there and drop her off. No paperwork, just a 30 minute drive and he’d be on to the next caper. “Ok, let’s go.”\n\nShe stands and exits the building. As she’s walking out she asks, “Can I get a cigarette before we go?”\n\n“You can wait until we get there, let’s just get going.” He answers. She ignores him entirely, walks over to a paraplegic in a wheel chair just under the concrete eve covering the front entrance, and grabs his half smoked Newport from his lips. He knows better than to mess with personified crazy but glares at her with unbridled rancor. \n\n“Let’s go.” Repeats Ryan, getting annoyed. She flicks the cigarette away and saunters a little closer to the cruiser. Ryan opens the door, ushering her in like a limo driver outside the Palm. She halts abruptly and kneels down, scooping up the still smoldering cigarette and taking another few drags before flicking it away again. \n\n“C’mon.” Ryan urges, sweeping his hand into the open door. She takes two more steps and another scoop of the now twice discarded cigarette. Puffing away and ignoring Ryan’s eye rolling, the lady takes in her surroundings. \n\n“I’m gonna get a beer.” She decides, and begins walking away from the cruiser, towards a seedy convenience store across the street. At first, Ryan means to protest. But a quick bolt of ingenuity stops him. If she consumes alcohol in public, that’s an arrestable offense. There will be more paperwork, but less coaxing crazy into his car. He decides to stay quiet and follow her at a distance. Just outside the store, the woman makes another abrupt stop, swaying slightly before whipping her head to one side, staring intently into a bush by the store window. She reaches in and retrieves an open tallboy of some cheap malt liquor. Ryan moves closer, knowing the opportunity to end this is at hand as the lady takes a deep swig. \n\nShe’s tipping back the can, glugging like a champion frat brother, when she stops suddenly, lowering the can from her lips but leaving her head tilted back. Her eyes narrow slightly in confusion then open wide indicating sudden clarity. “That’s piss.”\n\nRyan gags, retreating a couple steps in revulsion as she takes a couple more sniffs, and swigs the rest of the dark yellow urine before turning to Ryan, her thirst now quenched. “So, how about that ride?”\n",

        "text": "Here’s part two of my first ride-along.\n\nWhere did I leave off?  Oh… right.  Gas.\n\nLike I said before, we had JUST filled the car up with gas and dispatch came over the radio with a message of a guy with a gun who was threatening to shoot people outside an upscale restaurant.  A quick, “Jesus Christ” escaped both our lips and I suddenly realized I was NOT wearing body armor.  Bookers^^1 gave me quick instructions to hold on during the drive there and stay in the car if SHTF when we actually arrived.\n\nHe threw that tank of a Crown Victoria into D and put the pedal to the floor.  Lights were flashing, sirens were blaring, and we were tearing ass through a heavy-traffic downtown area.  Of course, we encountered several idiots who didn’t understand they needed to get out of the way.\n\nOn a side note, I now have a better understanding of the sense of frustration officers get when it comes to these oblivious idiots.\n \nAs we pulled up to the restaurant where the man was reported to be, another officer, Officer Ripple,^^1 had already placed him in handcuffs.  The man was obviously homeless and… uh… a bit out of it.  Officer Ripple then put on his gloves and started the search.  First was the man’s right jacket pocket.  Ripple dug around for just a brief second and pulled out a condom.  A tied-off, used condom.\n\nLet me elaborate just a bit more:  A tied-off, used, MOLDY condom.\n\nYeah.  This condom had been in his pocket so long, it was brown, inside and out.  This prompted a collective, “OHHHHHHHH SICK!” from all of us standing around, witnessing this spectacle.\n\n“What the FUCK, dude?!” Ripple said as he jumped back and tossed the condom to the ground.\n\n“Sorry, bro.  Should’ve said somethin’, huh?”\n\n“No shit.  Jesus.  Am I going to find any more of those?”\n\n“No way, man!” the homeless man said, a look of apology on his face.\n\nRipple dug around a bit more in the right jacket pocket and pulled out a plastic shopping bag which contained three eggs.  Okay… the guy needed to eat something, and eggs are plenty nutritious.  This makes sense.  I assume they were hard-boiled since they didn’t break during the rough handling they were receiving.\n\nRipple said, “I know I felt something else in there,” as his hand then went back inside the same pocket.\n\nNot even two seconds later, he pulled out a second condom.  A second used, tied-off, moldy condom.  Again, everyone let out groans and some laughter at the fact that poor Officer Ripple was the one having to endure this disgusting torture.\n\nRipple then went to the left pocket and fished around for a moment.  Guess what he found.  Can you guess?  You’ll never guess.  You give up?  Okay…\n\nA THIRD CONDOM.\n\nAt this point, the rest of us watching this unfold were doubled over with laughter (at Ripple’s reactions, not the homeless man), Ripple cursing and trying not to throw up in his mouth.  Unfortunately, Ripple knew there was something else inside the guy’s left jacket pocket, so his hand went back in as he cringed in pure disgust.  A moment later, his hand returned with a single .30-06 bullet.  A few eyebrows were raised and a couple more chuckles were let out.\n\nAs Ripple proceeded to search the man’s lunchbox, check for any pockets (which his shorts had none), and inspect his shoes (a pair of flip-flops), the search was basically over, other than a thorough pat-down.\n\nRipple laid out all items before the guy on the ground and asked the man, “Alright.  I need you to PLEASE tell me what the fuck you’re doing with three condoms, three eggs, and a .30-06 bullet.  Are you planning to create a human-chicken hybrid super species or something?”\n\nThe man stared at him for a moment, shook his head, and looked at the ground, almost as if he was mad that he was being questioned about his belongings.  He then replied, “I just wanted to save my unborn children for when the apocalypse comes.  Surely a woman will come along who will be worthy of my seed.  I can simply untie the containers and let her have it, y’know?”\n\nJesus.  This guy was serious.\n\n“And the .30-06 bullet?”\n\n“I like to go deer hunting back at home.  It’s my favorite thing to do.”\n\n“Where’s home?  Why are you here threatening people instead of being at home?”\n\n“I’m sorry, bro.  I can’t get a ride home anymore.”\n\n“Tell you what, buddy… we’ll take you to the station, let you call whoever you need to, and see if they’ll bail you out, okay?  You know you’re being arrested, right?”\n\n“Yeah.  I know,” the homeless man said, his head hanging low.\n\nRipple loaded him up in the back of the cruiser and took him away.  We couldn’t help but laugh, though, because Ripple was still cringing and gagging at the thought of having this guy in his cruiser.\n\n“Ho-oh-oh-OLY SHIT!” Bookers finally broke the ice.  “Did… did that just happen?”\n\n“I think so,” I said, staring at the taillights of Ripple’s cruiser.\n\n“That has to be the most insane thing I’ve seen happen since I’ve been a police officer,” Officer Braden,^^1 another officer on scene, said.\n\nAnd Officer Braden couldn’t have been more correct.  As it turns out, they still talk about that incident around the precinct.  I can’t really blame them… it’s apparently one of the more bizarre things that our local officers have encountered.\n",

        "text": "\nIf anyone doesn't know, cops have a wicked and morbid sense of humor. It's a defense mechanism. You can only deal with the scum of the earth, death, drugs, maiming, terror, fear, and abuse for so long. You either find the humor in it, or you lose your mind. Usually, a body to me, has something funny about it. Cause seriously, if you have to stand in a room, alone, with a dead guy, for a couple hours, you either crack jokes, or flip out.\nBut sometimes, after I leave, and after the smell dissipates from my clothes, and after the others are gone, and after body is taken, and after the creepiness wears off, I get sad.\n\nToday, a welfare check. Someone hasn't gone to work in 2 days. He has been depressed. He possibly has some mental conditions. He is divorced. He is losing his kids. He is on a downward spiral. And his boss is worried. I get there and talk to the boss. He tells me whats going on. He's concerned. His work truck is in the lot. I see days of newspapers at the door. I see a wallet, keys, belt, etc on the table inside. I get no answer. I am concerned. \nI wait for others, and the morbid jokes come out. I hope the A/C is on. I hope he's not on the toilet. Man, why didn't I stop at Wendy's on my way over. Im starving.\n\nI open the door, slightly. I smell the musk. The musky, dirty, dank, palpable odor of the deceased. He's in there. But he wont be answering. \n\nAfter the long and short of it, we go in. Announce. Nothing. Announce. Nothing. Stepping, ever so lightly through a strange and foreign apartment. Looking around, at things that don't belong to me. Looking. Making judgments, on how he lives, where he eats, what he watches on TV, when he does, or does not do dishes. We step, one foot at a time, into this persons life. Uninvited strangers in a home he did not plan on us seeing. \nAnd the smell is there. It's getting stronger. I can feel it in my nostrils, and on my tongue. I know. I know he's in here. Announce. Nothing. I turn and walk upstairs. Making sure to step only on carpet. Who knows. Dirty laundry could be evidence. One step. One step at a time. \n\nWorking my way upstairs. And the odor increases. It's no longer just a background. It has taken center stage. I reach the top. Glance to my left. He's here. And no, he's not answering. The details of the event are between him and me. And I pay him respect by keeping it that way. Detectives are called, and I back out of the house. I no longer have a reason to be there. I stay by the door, making sure that only those with a purpose come and go. I stand, I wait, I smell. And then I get to leave.\nThat's the bad part. Now I'm alone. Alone in my car, and alone with my thoughts.\n\nThis poor guy. Depressed, possibly unstable. Having recently lost everything. No longer seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Feeling that he has no other recourse. Sits. Sits with his means in his hands. And contemplates. Has to make a conscious decision. Has to believe that ending it will be better. For himself. For his family. Has to believe, somewhere, that he is making the right choice. And what must he think in those final moments. What must go through his mind. What makes a person reach that point, where that is the final solution. I know that everyone out there has at least one person that would do anything to talk you out of reaching that point. So, where was that person.\n\nSo he sits, and he thinks. And he is alone. And he reaches for his means. And the world goes dark. And he dies alone, which is probably the one thing that he didn't want to be.\n\nAnd I get sad.\n\n",

        "text": "First and foremost, I am NOT an officer.  Yet.  I was participating in our local department’s ride-along program and, given that it was my first one, I was more excited than a… uh… excited person.\n\nAs it turns out, I already knew the officer I was riding with, Officer Bookers^^1 from some interactions on Reddit, so it made the whole experience that much better.  He showed me where they regularly bust kids doing the dirty in the back of their cars, he showed me where people think they’re sneaky with drug deals (the places were laughable), and other fun pieces of information.\n\nOur day was pretty vanilla at first.  A call about a distressed guy seeking mental help (which got answered by another officer in the area), some radio chatter about other parts of the city… not much was going on at the time.\n\nDuring a patrol through some low-income housing, Bookers suddenly slammed on the brakes, started laughing, and said, “What was that for?!”  I looked up from my notebook (I was taking as many notes as possible instead of paying attention to my surroundings… good job, SPDSKTR) and saw a young boy, no older than 10 or 11.  I asked Bookers, “What?  What did he do?  What happened?”\n\nI didn’t expect this answer.\n\n“He just flipped us off!”\n\n“BWAHAHAHAHA!  WHAT?!”\n\nThe boy’s mother popped her head out the front door.\n\n“WHAT?!  WHAT MAH BOY DO?!  WHAT YOU DO, BOY?!”\n\nBookers wiped tears from his eyes and said, “He just flipped us off, ma’am!”\n\nThe woman kicked the door wide open, causing it to slam against the side of the building.  She stormed out of the apartment with fire in her eyes and grabbed that poor boy by the arm.  And she lit his ass up.\n\n“DON’ *[POW!]* CHOO *[POW!]* EVAH *[POW!]* DIS-*[POW!]*-RE-*[POW!]*-SPECT *[POW!]* DA *[POW!]* PO-*[POW!]*-LICE!”\n\nOh my god.  This was actually happening.\n\nWe started howling with laughter, tears pouring from our eyes as a stitch set up in our sides.  Before us was an angry mother, teaching this boy a valuable lesson in life.  We could hear him pleading with her as she kept spanking him, feeding her excuses such as, “I DI’IN’T MEAN TO, MOMMA!” and, “IT WAS A JOKE, MOMMA!”\n\nAfter sitting there for a good two minutes and regaining our composure, Bookers (still giggling, mind you) said, “Oh man.  That was perfect.  How about we go fill up the car and grab something to drink?”\n\nWe drove over to the filling station and immediately after he topped the car off, the radio comes to life.  We heard something about “a man with a gun, threatening to shoot people.”\n\nJesus.\n\nLights and sirens.  Here we go.\n\n*To be continued…*\n\n---\n\n^^1 - Names changed to protect privacy.\n\n---\n\nIf you guys would like to hear more about what happened during my time in these ride-alongs, let me know.  We had some *really* interesting things happen in the three ride-alongs I participated in.",

        "text": "It was a beautiful summer day, not a cloud graced the sky and the temperature hovered somewhere around perfect.  It was a routine afternoon shift and I was but a mere hour into enjoying the day when an assignment came over the radio.  “7Mary3* a check for well being on Apartment Dr.  7Mary3 respond to Apartment Dr reference a nine year old subject ‘Anthony’ who has not attended school this week, complainant is the principal of the school.” \n\n I acknowledged the assignment with nonchalance, it was only Tuesday and I figured a quick visit from the police would have this young man back in school.  I strolled into the building and buzzed the apartment to enter the building. The low rumble of the electronic buzzer filled the lobby and I entered the hallway.  A good start I thought to myself, they buzzed me in, should be easy enough from here.\n\t\nI made my way to the end of the hallway and knocked on the door.  A shirtless boy opened the door with enthusiasm and I looked down at him and smiled, “Are you Anthony?”  He replied with a coy “Yes.”  Anthony opened the door a crack more and a sharp odor immediately permeated the stale air.  I knew the smell, I knew what it was.  I just didn’t want to believe it; today is the kind of the day where everything is alright with the world.  My mind grasped for alternatives to the source of this smell, maybe they missed garbage day, what if someone forgot to empty the litter box.\n\nWith a slight hesitation in my voice I looked Anthony in the eye and asked “Anthony, where is your dad?”  Without any hesitation, Anthony looked me in the eye and replied, “Lying on the floor in the kitchen.”  I looked down at him with an inquisitive look and stood in the doorway of this apartment for what felt like an eternity.  This was not a normal answer and was not what I expected to hear when I asked that question.  I took a tentative step into the apartment and was engulfed by the smell of death.  I glanced over the half wall in the entryway of the apartment and discovered the source of this smell.\n\nA bloated and decomposing corpse lay on the floor in the living room, it was Anthony’s father.  I wasn’t prepared for this, what I thought was a simple check for well being took a turn that I didn’t see coming.  I asked Anthony to come into the hallway with me.  I keyed up my radio and my mind was racing, after two attempts I was able to relay my supervisor my location and told sputtered out that I had a “triple zero” subject in the residence and that I needed a boss there.  I knelt down in front of Anthony and tried to say something, to say anything, I wanted to fix this situation.  I knew I couldn’t fix this; I knew nothing could turn back the clock and bring Anthony’s dad back to life.  I looked at Anthony and told him the only thing I could think of.  I told Anthony that his dad was not going to be OK and that his dad was dead.   Anthony’s looked changed from coy to heartbroken, he began to sob and my heart shattered.  This isn’t what a child deserves.  I knelt with Anthony and asked him if he needed a hug, he tearfully shook his head no, I don’t think I asked for his sake.  I needed that, I wanted to be that hero that you see on TV.  I wanted to be the person he reached out to.  I wasn’t, I was a stranger in a cheap polyester uniform that just ruined his world and ripped apart everything he knew.  I moved Anthony to the stairway near the side door of the building.  Anthony and I spent what felt like forever sitting there, I don’t know what you say to a child who just lost their father, a child who just lost their only parent, a child whose life has just been changed forever.\n\nOut of the bright sunlight my sergeant strode in, shortly behind him was an Officer who was my field training officer when I started.  Thank god, someone who knows me, recognized the panic in my voice over the air.  We stood by for a short while longer until the arrival of the detectives.  My sergeant who was not known for his range of emotions attempted to make small talk with Anthony to no avail, we asked Anthony when the last time his dad was OK was.  Anthony told us he last talked to his dad on Friday night when he went to bed.  Friday, Friday night his father took his own life leaving Anthony to live in an apartment with his dead father for four days.\n\n  I was told by my sergeant to return to the station to do an initial report on this incident.  I looked back at Anthony on the stairs, no longer crying but an incredible sadness now filled his face.  I took one look back at Anthony, I don’t recall saying goodbye, I don’t recall saying anything, I had said enough to Anthony.\n\nI would come to find out later that Anthony’s mother lived in New York and had no contact with Anthony or his father.  Anthony and his father lived in by themselves; the closest relatives living a couple states over in Tennessee.\n\nI’ve dealt with many people and don’t give many a second thought, but every so often I think about Anthony.\n\n*Not my actual beat, I wish.\n",

        "text": "Another ride along tale.\n\nI was riding with the same agency as [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/23aidw/the_first_time_i_ever_heard_an_officer_swear_on/) but with a different officer, one whom I had known for many many years.  We're both big Star Wars nerds, and had happily spent our unoccupied time talking about Episode III and why it sucked, when we got a dead body call.\n\nThe town this agency works for has a large-ish river running along it's southern end, one that's quite popular with the rafting/kayaking crowd.  It's also glacial fed, so it's quite cold causing people die on it yearly, and occasionally they aren't found until after the spring runoff when the river drops back down.  Such was the case this time, when the body was discovered it was in a backwater area known for having the occasional corpse pop up.  When we got there water rescue, the fire department, and the medical investigator were already on scene.  Not much for us to do except watch things unfold and keep the onlookers back a bit.\n\nDue to the way the river lies, the steep embankments and such, the body couldn't just be put on a stretcher and carried out, it had to be lifted by a crane.  However, the body had been soaking in the river for several months, so it was fragile.  They got it into a body bag, strapped the bag on a backboard, and started to lift it up to the waiting ME.\n\nThen something went wrong.  I wasn't looking when it happened, but turned as I started to hear a lot of \"WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!\" being yelled, just in time to see the backboard tip over, and with a truly horrible *SSHHHHLORK* sound all of the flesh detached from the skeleton and pooled itself in one end of the bag, which was now dangling from the overturned backboard, and leaking all sorts of unmentionable fluids.\n\nWhich is when the stench hit.  Jesus H. Tap Dancing Christ and his 12 Apostle backup crew was that bad.  Everyone, the ME included, was gagging.  The crowd of onlookers started to run to escape the fumes.  My eyes watered, I coughed uncontrollably, and I wanted to throw up.  If you could bottle that shit it would be WAY more effective than OC.\n\nI turned to my officer buddy, who was having his own difficulties with this horrific odor, and put on my best Han Solo impersonation.  \"What an interesting smell you've discovered!\"  He looked at me like I'd grown a third arm, and told me to stop being a smart ass.  Ah, friends, what would we do without them?\n\nSeveral larger body bags and trash bags were then quickly grabbed, and used to contain the...effluence.  I'm very glad I wasn't asked to participate in that, it's the one time a smell has actually caused my stomach to churn, and I don't know if I could have held it together.  Once the ~~body~~ ~~remains~~ ex-human soup was finally in something that kept it from smelling like Satan's bowels after a Taco Bell binge and the scene was cleared, the officer and I both quickly retreated back to the police station locker room for long showers with borrowed scented shampoo.  But the scent lingered on me for several hours, and it still haunts my dreams to this day.\n\nTL;DR - http://i.imgur.com/3GqAIF9.jpg",

        "text": "**Let me know if i'm submitting too much and I'll slow down. I like having all this in writing finally to be able to give to my kids one day and this is better than watching Sports Center during my lunch breaks.**\n\nI was working in a fairly quiet area one winter morning, a slave to the radio and wherever the tyrannical dispatcher decided to send me. It was a day work shift and the agency I worked for had at some point decided it was a good idea to have officers cover school crossings in lieu of having crossing guards. So, due to the several officers at schools, and several more at court, I was one of maybe two units available to take calls. \n\n\nDispatch came across and started me for an animal complaint, a possible rabid raccoon in the caller’s yard. I argued briefly over the computer but was shut down when I learned all the wardens were out of service for a mandatory half day training session. Resigned to my fate and knowing I’d be alone, I marked en route to the sick critter. \nI arrived at the address and the scene was like something out of a [cheesy Thomas Kinkade painting]( http://theskunkpot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/thomas_kinkade_48.jpg). A fresh blanket of snow covered the impeccably manicured, large front yard of a little cottage style house in one of the more affluent sections of the area. I noticed the small footprints leading through the snow up to the little bandit, sitting up on his haunches, swaying as though he’s had too many Bartles and James’s. The homeowner was peering at me through the large picture window in the front of the home. He was an older guy, possible war vet by the look of him, and he points to the raccoon (as if I hadn’t already seen him) and gives me a thumbs up followed by a finger gun and a smile. \n\nI have none of the fancy animal warden equipment and at that point I’d seen them take care of this situation by trapping them with a dog pole, shoving them into a cage then injecting them with something that takes care of them pretty quickly. All I had on me was my asp, OC, and sidearm. It was clear the OC was going to be of no use as the little guy seemed to not even register my arrival and I doubted he would be affected by spray. I armed myself with my baton (weak hand) and gun, and slowly crept towards my target. \n\nThe pressure was on since I knew I had an audience but I was unsure what distance was safe from both a lunging attack as well as the possibility of blood spray from a new 9mm hole in the little guy. The home owner was watching with rapt attention, smiling and making a “go-on” gesture, flicking his wrists in unison and nodding his head in approval. I leveled my gun, apologized to the raccoon for any suffering he might have gone through and, 10 yards away, fired a round that entered his little head, dislodging his jaw on the way out the back of his neck. \n\nA spray of blood followed the bullet out and blood spurted out the entry wound briefly as he fell to the ground, legs propelling himself in a circle around his writhing upper body. 10 second and it was done. He stopped moving, no more blood flowed out of the wound. \n\nKnowing I needed to at least put the body in a trash bag or something, I crept forward very slowly, gun trained on him in case he was playing possum. The mess made by his death was startling when juxtaposed on the clean white snow; bright red spray and pools accentuated by bits of hair and rabies foam. The owner was still watching, now a look of approval with his arms crossed and a “not bad” expression accompanied by a slight nod. I kept edging closer. \n\nSlowly I reached out with my expandable baton, inch by inch getting closer. Finally, contact. I lightly prodded him and got no reaction. I breathed a sigh of relief, holstered up, and went to retract my baton by slamming it on the frozen ground. \n\nI guess it was the noise of the action, or the vibration from the slam, or maybe something else, entirely more nefarious, but the raccoon suddenly made a half hiss, half gurgle noise and “spasmed”, I swear, in my direction. I screamed that scream you make involuntarily when “that itch” turns out to be a spider, dropped my baton, drew my weapon and fired three more rounds into him while skipping backwards, away from the zombie raccoon. \n\nOnce I was a safe distance away and after my butt unclenched I caught my breath and looked up at the old man. I had assumed he’d laugh maybe, or shake his head in a “You kids these days…” fashion, finger wagging at me and a sheepish smile on his face. He wasn’t though. He was looking very concerned. He then moved his gaze over my shoulder and beyond me, pointing to something he wanted me to look at.  I turned around apprehensively, gun still un-holstered and I’d like to think smoking like in a Spaghetti Western. There was a school bus - an elementary school bus. The driver’s jaw was dropped, eyes wide in astonishment, and every window on my side of the bus filled with a curious, cherubic face. \n\nI sniffed, mimed a nose wipe, holstered my weapon like nothing had happened, and made my way nonchalantly to the front door of the house where I was greeted by the old man. He handed me a trash bag as the air brakes of the bus hissed their protest and the bus peeled away. \n\nAll he said was, “Nice shooting, kid.”\n",

        "text": "While patrolling a high crime area, I stopped on a gang member known locally as a small time dope dealer. He didn't see me approaching until I was about 5 yards away. I braced myself for the possibility for a foot chase but instead, when he realized I was upon him, he did the \"oh crap\" toss of a Doritos bag he was holding and put his hands in the air. \n\nHe was clearly high so I sat him down, called for back-up and picked up the bag, joking how I could charge him with littering. He looked away and muttered, \"That bag's not mine.\" \n\nI replied, “Dude, I just saw you drop it.” I opened it up and found a few gram bags of weed. That made sense.\n\nSeeing as backup still hadn’t arrived, I decided to apply cuffs at this point. After putting them on, I then started the pat-down. When I hit the \"condom pocket,\" I felt a crinkle. Sure enough, another gram bag. \n\n\"These aren't my pants.\" \n\n“Dude, this stuff is in the same baggies as the Dorito weed. Do you think I stupid?”\n\nI decided a more thorough search is now in order. I proceed to full-on empty his pockets, check hat liner, etc. I get to his shoes and before I finish slipping the first one off I hear, \"These aren't my shoes.\" Sure enough, more weed and a bunch of cash tucked in the toe of both.\n\nPrior to loading him in the cruiser (he had warrants, crazy, right?!?) we did the ultra-thorough, pre-jail search. Sure enough, crinkle in the region of his junk. I had to ask him, \"Is this yours?\"\n",

        "text": "I was assigned to a plain clothes detail, working surveillance in a neighborhood known for drugs and gangs. Eventually we thought we had honed in on a drug house: lots of short term foot and vehicle traffic; leasing office had multiple, unrelated people on the lease: what few people we could ID had criminal histories, etc. Long story short, we developed enough probable cause for a search warrant. Due to the aforementioned shadiness of the place, it was decided our SWAT team would execute the no-knock for us. They asked if a couple of us would mind doing to the pre-surveillance for them and, seeing as it was mine and my buddy’s case, we were given the nod. \n\nWe dressed down, guns in our paddle holsters and dirtied up to appear homeless or thug-like if we needed to, and got in our undercover car to park up the road from the target residence. We would periodically update SWAT regarding foot traffic and lights on in the unit, but all-in-all it was a quiet assignment. SWAT notified us they were making their approach and we decided we wanted a better view of the action (flash bangs are awesome!). We walked the block up the road from our UC car to a couple houses away from the target. Sure enough, up roll the trucks, out jump the SWAT operators, boom go the flash bangs and we’re being called in to execute the warrant and start the search. \n\nThe search itself was fairly uneventful. No one owned up to the coke and weed we found. We uncovered a small-time document mill and after talking with our intelligence unit, opted to lock up everyone in the house. Our boss delegated the bad guys to other squad members who were in uniform and in cage cars. We left after a couple hours, the neighborhood having lost interest in our earlier actions and getting back to its quasi-ghetto normalcy.\n\nSo, we’re walking back to our cruiser, our boss giving us props and my buddy splits off to talk to his girl on his phone, leaving me and the lieutenant in the road. He’s in uniform and is a giant, 6’8” and muscular, former SWAT member. We notice a group walking up the street, on a path perpendicular to our own but conveniently in the shadows. They miss me and my boss but see my buddy, his face illuminated by his phone. They do a quick huddle and, JV football style, break into a wide line now stalking towards my buddy. We all notice this predatory action at the same time, make eye contact, and my boss and I duck in between some cars, still concealed from the group. \n\nMy buddy hung up and pretended to text while still walking towards the group of about five, now obvious, juveniles. Boss and I are creeping from car to car, keeping pace with him before eventually over taking him and ducking behind a car to allow the now outflanked group to pass us. \n\nMy buddy recognizes one of the kids from a distance when they pass under a streetlight and says, “Hey Mr. Brown. Aren’t you supposed to be home?” I see a look of confusion in one of the kids’ faces, then clarity but it’s too late, his pals have passed my position. \n\nI notice one of the kids on the outskirts of the group pull an object from his waistband and rack it. Before I can say anything (literally milliseconds) my boss screams “GUUUUUN!!!” and puts his massive size 20 Red Wing boot into a kids face, knocking him off his feet and through the air before full on tackling two others. I lunge at the kid my buddy called out and judo throw him onto his buddy, the one  my boss knocked to the ground, driving my knee his back and screaming, I’m sure, unintelligible profanity while drawing my weapon and covering them both. My buddy is able to get the last guy tackled and in cuffs then draws and helps hold the other four at gun point while we secure all of them.\n\nWe pat them all down and find two metal airsoft guns with realistic slides, almost identical to their real-world counterparts. Between them, they also had a butterfly knife, large hunting knife and a butcher’s knife concealed on them. As we’re trying to get on the radio, following the adrenaline dump and returning to reality, an armed robbery gets toned out close by. We can’t get a word in edge wise between the dispatcher’s updates and units forgetting they can mark en route via their computer, so we are forced to wait a minute. \n\nThe kid we recognized, a constant runaway and suspect in several local robberies, is now sobbing uncontrollably, whining “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were a cop,” and “They’re just BB guns, I swear!” I told him to shut up and bore down harder, worrying he might be trying to squirm out of the dog-pile of dumbass I was kneeling on. \n\nI look over to my boss and he’s just effing majestic: standing tall with his weapon at his side, both boots standing on a cuffed, whining perp, surfer style and cursing his radio mic, waiting to get us some more units so we’re not outnumbered. My buddy’s bad guy is screaming in pain – apparently there was an ant’s nest in the vicinity where he was detained and, face down with his hands cuffed behind his back, the ants are realizing they have an easy meal. \n\nWhen it was all said and done, all five got off with next to nothing, charge wise. Each got community service for “discharging a pneumatic gun in public” (the only thing they owned up to in interviews) and the felony “mob assembly” charge we dropped on them was dropped. The DA in charge of the case said he didn’t feel a group of kids racking a gun and walking menacingly at a lone person constituted an attempted robbery and the kid’s lawyers agreed.  At least we got  to take away a good story.\n",

        "text": "This story comes not from a police car, but from inside a school closed for Spring Break.  In the wake of Thurston, Columbine, and Virginia Tech, new training regimens were put in place in order to be better prepared for an active shooter scenario.  This was run by our county sheriff, and they invited the criminal justice department of my college to come and participate as role players.  Yay, a week of free pizza and playing Big Boy Paintball!\n\nOne particular scenario involved me hiding in a small closet at the junction of a T-intersection of a hallway, waiting for the contact team to pass me, then jumping out, firing a couple sims at the team to get their attention, then running down the hallway out of sight and barricading myself in one of the classrooms with my gun to my head.  These were just simunitions, not really loud but you should still have your ears in, just in case.\n\nSo the first couple run throughs go pretty well, the team goes past, I engage them, and they find me yelling about how I'm going to kill myself if they come into the room.  Most of them back off, which is the sign for \"call in a negotiator,\" and the scenario is over.  One officer kind of dumbly entered the room and started searching for a light switch with their rifle off-line of me, so I opened fire as I had been told.  13 rounds, 10 on target, not bad for off-hand and with a mask on.\n\nBut then the mistake came.  As I ran down the hall, one of the safety proctors would fire a .357 revolver loaded with blanks as I ran past him.  My ear protection was just a set of foam ear plugs, and they'd stayed in thus far.  But apparently the running and jumping and melodramatic suicide threats had shifted my left plug, because two things happened in very quick succession as I ran past:  the ear plug fell out, and the blank went off.\n\nNow a .357 is not exactly what you would call a \"quiet round.\"  And when your hearing has been muffled for a couple hours, your adrenaline is spiking as you run, your thirsty, and that round goes off just a couple feet from your head, it does unkind things to your equilibrium.  I lost my balance, stumbled, and face planted into the floor, the sim gun skittering out of my hand and down the hall.  Before I could figure out what the hell had just happened to me, and before the safety proctor could turn around and figure out what that noise was, here comes the contact team.  Lit me the FUCK up, I don't think there was a spot on me that wasn't covered in paint.  A safety halt was quickly called, and I got checked out by the medic (I was fine, no permanent hearing loss, just a headache and bruised ego).  But I learned a very, very valuable lesson in checking your safety equipment that day.\n\nOther than that, it was a very fun week, the 30-odd CJ students got some great experience in tactical situations, the drama students from the high school we were in got to be casualties and bystanders (which really added to the realism), and our local officers got real world experience that served them well 2 years later when an actual active shooter occurred at a local mall.\n\nTL;DR - **WHAT?  SPEAK UP, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.**",

        "text": "This comes from several years ago, when I had only just started a degree in criminal justice.  At that point in time, I was still kind of naive as to what actually goes on in the day-to-day business of law enforcement, as I'd only met officers either A) as a small child when they came to our school for outreach stuff, or B) the couple times I'd been pulled over for minor traffic violations.  I had never seen the nitty gritty, the stuff that cops talk about over beers in the corner of a local bar.  I was about to have an eye opener.  I held officers on a pedestal that most of you who are in the profession would tut at.\n\nI was just a ride-along.  Bright yellow reflective vest that said \"OBSERVER\" in very official looking letters across the back.  Been told to not touch anything, not to say anything during contacts, just to watch and not interfere.  I'm okay with that, I have a notebook with me to take down observations, this was a project for one of my classes.\n\nWe got a call of a domestic in progress, in a nearby trailer park.  When we arrived on scene, it was all I could do to not break out in laughter, because it was *so cliche.*  Dilapidated single-wide, home-built garage with a Firebird up on blocks, overgrown weeds everywhere.  As the officer got out of the car the male subject stepped outside, resplendent in a hair metal t-shirt and a mullet that would make Joe Dirt proud.  The half-empty bottle of Jack in his hand just added to the atmosphere.  Did I suddenly get transported into a 1989 episode of COPS?\n\nTwo more units arrive, one a female officer, as I stay outside.  I can hear raised voices from the trailer, but nothing that suggested a fight, just arguing.  Eventually, the door opens up, and the officer I'm riding with leads the male subject outside.  Suddenly the door slams shut and a very loud commotion erupts in the trailer, with two female voices being VERY loud and the sound of thumps as something vaguely body-sized ran into objects vaguely furniture sized (only found out later that the female subject had punched the female officer and kicked the door closed).  My officer, with a hand still on the male subject, turned to look back at what was going on.\n\nWhich is when the male subject attacked.  It happened very fast, and to this day I'm uncertain as to how they got into this position, but they ended up on the ground, the officer on his back, the male subject on top of him, with the officer trying to hold him in a head lock.  I stood rooted to the spot, unsure of what to do, because it was obvious the officer needed help yet I had been told not to interfere.  The officer was yelling, not words but shouts of pain.  The male subject had bitten down on the officer's arm.  Oh shit, that's blood.\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?\"  I yelled, since at this point I knew I had to do *something,* regardless of what I'd been told.\n\n\"FUCKING KICK THIS SON OF A BITCH!\" was the reply.  I remember being shocked at hearing such language from an officer on duty.  I still had them on a too-high pedestal, remember?\n\n\"W-WHAT?\" was my articulate and well-thought-out response.\n\n\"DO IT!  KICK THIS FUCKER IN THE HEAD OR SOMETHING!  SHIT!\"\n\n\"Okay-y...\"\n\nNow, you should know that all through grade school, junior high, and high school, I played soccer.  I got into a position to bend the male subject's head like Beckham, but was genuinely concerned about killing the guy.  It was mid-April, raining as usual, and I was wearing boots.  One of my kicks with those boots on to the side of your head COULD kill you.  I didn't want to do that.  But the officer had told me to kick the guy.  So I did, I toe-pointed him right behind the left ear.  I didn't put a ton of force behind the kick, so he didn't lose consciousness, but his brain definitely went BSOD for a moment and then booted in safe mode.  The officer was able to get him rolled over and cuffed, while I stood off to the side in a bit of shock.  Blood ran down the officer's arm in pretty copious amounts.\n\nI asked the officer for the keys to his trunk, and ran to get the first aid kit.  At least this was something I felt comfortable doing, I've had a lot of first aid training in my life.  The wound was pretty bad, about and inch across and quite deep.  It wasn't just teeth marks, there was a chunk missing.  I cleaned the wound, dressed it as best I could, while the officer was on his radio calling for an ambulance and backup.\n\nAbout this time the other two officers came storming out of the house, holding the wildly thrashing female subject between them.  Blood was all over the female officer's face, a face that was screwed up in the most \"DO NOT FUCK WITH ME RIGHT NOW\" scowl I've ever seen.  They got the female subject into one of the other cars, and came over to see why I had the first aid kit out and why my officer was holding his arm very gingerly and swearing a quiet but unstopping blue streak.  Pretty soon the trailer park was filled with emergency vehicles.  My ride along was obviously over, but I still had to make several statements about what I had done, when I had done it, how I had done it, exactly WHERE I had done it, why I had done it again, and finally if I knew who had won the 1962 World Series.  Okay, maybe not that last part, but it felt like one hell of a grilling.  I was taken home, and told to expect phone calls.\n\nAnd yep, the next day my phone blew up.  Calls from the shift supervisor, the police chief (this was a smaller municipal agency, about 45 officers all told), the county DA, and a detective with the county sheriff.  Eventually there were also calls from the male subject's attorney.  Got called in to court to testify twice.  Eventually the trial ended and the male subject was found guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced to 9 years.  The officer I had been riding with was out on medical leave for almost 6 months, the bite had damaged some of the muscles in his forearm and he'd had to have surgery.\n\nNow, to wrap this back up to the beginning, the original complaint?  They had been arguing, and he'd slapped her.  No other violent or drug-related criminal charges in their past, no prior visits for domestic violence.  So the officer, the male subject, and the female officer in the hospital, the male subject looking at the better part of a decade in prison, the female subject got two years for resisting arrest and assault, and I got one HELL of a report to turn in for class, all due to a slap.\n\nTL;DR - COPS is filmed with the men and women of law enforcement.

        "text": "I was working a foot beat in a fairly bad neighborhood known for its gang violence and drug trade and was en route to meet up with a partner to do some high intensity gang intervention. While waiting on the agreed upon corner, I noticed a kid with a backpack crouched down near a window well. I tucked myself behind a tree just in time to see another male approach and greet the kid. They shook hands, looked around and then both took something from their pockets before shaking again and quickly parting ways. Clearly, it was on. \n\nThe older male left in a direction away from me but the kid began walking right towards my position. I was giddy with anticipation as one only gets before a quality stop and I couldn’t help but smile. Time ticked by slowly and I realized the kid should have passed me. I peeked around the tree and there he was, leaning against a tree not ten feet from me. Realizing my ambush scenario had dissolved, I decided I’d have to approach him to make contact.\n\nAt that very moment, my tardy partner decided to pull up in his cruiser. The timing couldn’t have been worse as, upon seeing the cruiser, the kid uprooted himself and began strolling again in my direction just as I exited cover. We locked eyes and he must have realized I knew what was up because he immediately took off, full sprint, just out of reach of my feeble attempt to grab him. \n\nI took up the pursuit, calling it in on my radio as he cut between a couple buildings. I had recognized him, when we were face to face, as a member of MS13 and remembered a recent threat that was voiced to us saying that in the neighborhood I was now running through, MS13 had planned to ambush an LEO via the use of a foot pursuit heading to t set area where other members would be lying in wait. I had to slow down and take my time because of this, but never lost sight of him for more than a second or two. \n\nBy the time we made it through the buildings and to a road, my partner must have completed two or three laps of our block. I could hear his siren bouncing off the buildings, getting stronger and fading out again. I made it known we were crossing a road and watched as my target made his way into a three story apartment building across the street from me. I waited the 20 seconds or so it took my partner and another unit to arrive, the whole time watching the second story window and taking note the suspect had clearly made his way to the third floor. \n\nWe entered and were greeted by some kids who were excited to see us. They happily told us the “bad guy ran upstairs,” confirming what I had seen. We made our way up to the third floor and waited for another couple units before we began the process of elimination, knocking first on one of the doors on the building’s front side as the other officers covered the other doors just in case. \n\nDoor #1 was answered by an elderly lady taking care of several kids. She indicated she had not seen anything and allowed us a quick sweep to confirm he wasn’t inside. The other door on the front side opened and a 20 something male allowed us to clear his apartment too. Now we were down to two. I went to the first and knocked. No answer after several attempts which would be par for the course for a hiding suspect. \n\nI then knocked on the last one. A teenager I recognized as another MS13 member answered. I asked him “Who just came in here?” and he replied “No one.” At first he denied us entry to sweep but he relented once we said we weren’t going anywhere anytime soon. We quickly cleared the living area and kitchen but as we made our way to the bathroom, the teenager told us, “Don’t go in there. My roommate just got home from an overnight shift and she’s showering.” \n\n“What’s your roommate’s name?” I asked.\n\n“Flor,” he replied with no hesitation, “She rents that room.” He pointed to an open door. The occupant was clearly female, a makeup case was open on the bed and the walls were decorated with those corny illustrations of puppies standing on two legs, bashfully holding out a bouquet of flowers. \n\n“How long has she been in there?” I asked.\n\n“Five minutes. She usually takes long showers though.” \n\nI decided to wait her out and told the teenager my plan. He nervously replied that it was ok with him and we made small talk for a few minutes, the other units still maintaining cover on the last remaining door. Ten minutes passed, then fifteen. I had decided it was worth a knock on the bathroom door and got up and approached the door. “You can’t,” the teenager said, “She’s a girl!”\n\n“I’m not going to open it, just see how much longer she’ll be.” I assured the kid. I knocked and waited, listening to the water flowing in the shower. I knocked again, only louder and said, “Police.”\n\nFrom inside I heard a muffled, high pitch falsetto reply, “Who is it?” I smiled a little inside as it came together. “Police” I repeated, “just have a question. Are you decent?” I tried the handle but it was locked.\n\n“No, go away please.” The falsetto replied. \n\n“Sir, I can’t go away until I find out why you ran.” I yelled through the door. There was a moment of silence before the reply came in the same falsetto.\n\n“I didn’t run away. I don’t know why you chased me.”\n\nIt was all over now, I knew, and I turned to the teenaged occupant with a triumphant smile. “He comes out now or I kick the door in.”\n\nThe teenager sighed and approached the door. “C’mon Josue, they know it’s you.”\n\nNo answer on the other side. The teenager got a bamboo kebab skewer and picked the lock. “Don’t break anything; just get him out of here.” He told us as we cautiously peeked into the bathroom. \n\nThere in the shower was my target, fully clothed with his backpack still on, dripping wet and looked sickly. I quickly handcuffed him and dragged him dripping into the living room where I got his vitals and confirmed a warrant for assault was outstanding. Inside his back pack I found several gram bags of marijuana, a few more in his pockets. I asked him if he ran because of the warrant, the weed, or both. \n\nHe slowly lifted his head, hung in shame from the time we extricated him from the shower, and vomited all over the living room carpet.\n\nAs we left, I informed the teenaged occupant I would be back with a summons for obstruction. He looked back at me, still astounded by what his buddy had left for him to clean up and said “Come back soon, man. If my mom gets here and sees this she’s going to kick my ass.”\n",

        "text": "**This is a long one, but this is the first time I've written it down:**\n\nSeveral years ago I was tasked with developing our agency's operational procedures for the then brand new mobile fingerprint scanners. In order to do so, I was given the device to beta test and use in a day to day manner in the field. Now, these days when you think of a mobile fingerprint device, you think of some small, portable device that syncs with other data devices such as the cruiser computer, etc. This thing, however, was a monster, similar to [this]( http://www.motorolasolutions.com/XL-EN/Business+Solutions/Industry+Solutions/Municipalities/National+Government/Biometrics/Mobile+AFIS__Loc:XL-EN). Heavy, expensive, and most pertinent to this story, dependent on cell service to operate. \n\nI was on a day work shift at the time, having a slow and uneventful day when I got a message from my sergeant to give him a call. This in and of itself wasn’t unusual but the giddiness in his voice when I got a hold of him threw me off a bit. “ARU (accident reconstruction unit) is requesting you and your fancy machine. They’ve got a fatal on the highway and need help ID-ing one of the people involved.”\n\nI dutifully accepted the assignment, wondering what could be so difficult about a routine fatal investigation that they would need a fingerprint run. I thought maybe it was an unruly driver/suspect, probably drunk and refusing to provide identification. I eventually made my way to the scene and was greeted by a blockade of fire apparatus. I parked and ducked the rescue tape they had strung, making my way to the ARU SUV parked up the road. There, I met with a detective taking notes and mapping out the scene. He pointed to the smoldering wreckage up ahead, a small sedan wedged underneath a semi, both charred to a skeletal state, and explained what happened. \n\n“The truck driver didn’t see the sedan, came over and trapped it under the trailer. No skid marks, but they both went up. Truck driver made it out. He’s back in the ambulance, all broken up. I’ll probably charge him.”\n\n“Cool.” I nodded, waiting for further instruction as he went back to his notes. “So, did you need the AFIS?”\n\n“Oh, yeah, sorry. Hold on, I’ll get it.”\n\nI was confused a bit. ‘It’?  The detective got out of the SUV, went to the rear and opened the hatch. He pulled out a crumpled brown paper bag and held it out for me to take. I tentatively received it, noticing it had some heft to it as well as some odd, oily stains along the bottom. \n\n“Your boss didn’t tell you what was up?” He asked, picking up on my confusion. \n\n“Nope.” I replied, slowly opening the bag. I braced myself for what I finally realized I was about to see. Nestled inside the bag was the severed hand of the unfortunate sedan driver. It was clearly a female’s hand, wedding ring sparkling through some soot and blood. \n\n“We couldn’t get to the tag, any ID burnt up in the fire. It’s all still too hot to tell if there’s anything else that will help. Fire guys found this across the road. Must've severed during the wreck.”\n\nI gloved up and knew what I had to do. Some firemen came over, smirking and elbowing each other as I delicately removed the hand. I put the bag down on the hood of another cruiser, the hand onto the bag, and pulled out the AFIS. It powered up and opened the fingerprint capture program. The spinning indicator told me it was attempting to get service but it was taking a while. Damn, I was going to have to find a better cell service area. I told the detective and he suggested I try up the hill, a good 200 yard walk. The whole road was shut down so there was no problem hoofing it. \n\nI made my way up the hill, bag ’o’ hand on one side, AFIS on the other, and tried for service again. Still nothing. The road where the accident took place is a major thoroughfare, three lanes across and one of the most convenient North/South highways in the area. People here, as I assume they do everywhere, get flustered when their routine is disrupted. They often don’t know how to take secondary roads to bypass inconveniences like those we were creating with this closure. The top of the hill I was walking towards was a cloverleaf, another semi-major road crossing overtop in an East/West manner. Motor units had taken up the task of shutting down the on-ramps, strutting around with their day-glow vests and angrily whistling at drivers who were trying to gawk at the wreckage down the road. I came to a street light with an electrical box at its base and tried for service again. Success, although the signal was still weak. I placed the AFIS on the box, and took the hand from the bag, gently pressing the index finger on the scanner. I’m not sure if it was some auto fluid, flame retardant, or the lady’s hand lotion but I got a very poor quality scan (not unusual for women’s hands). I figured I’d give it a shot, took a second print from the middle finger, and placed the hand back into the bag. I prayed to the Gods of cellular service that my data-packet would transmit, held up the AFIS in prayer, and waited. And waited. Crap. No dice. I knew I’d have to find a better spot.\n\nI walked a little further up and used a guard rail to set up my workspace. By now, I had grown used to working with the hand, and I was cursing the AFIS more than my strange assignment. I scanned again, held the device up to the Heavens again, and got another no-go result. A sudden thought came up. “Why don’t you print it while you have a strong signal?” Brilliant! I held the device up, took the hand out of the bag and married them up above my head. This time it looked like it might work! The spinning indicator turned into a green check mark! Success!\n\nSuddenly, from behind, I heard the squealing of brake pads. I turned and made eye contact with an elderly Asian lady, jaw slack with astonishment. I can only guess what she thought about my triumphant grin and realized I should probably make a more appropriate expression. I turned on angry cop mode and yelled, “What are you doing here?!?”\n\nShe didn’t reply. The shell shocked scan of her eyes as I hid the hand behind my back indicated she had seen it all. A motor cop came jogging over, cursing at the poor lady. “Sorry man. She must have slipped around me.” He said as he blew his whistle angrily and motioned for her to turn around. \n\nA second later, the triumphant “Ding-Dong” of a return shook me from my embarrassment. A return! I clicked on the new file, hoping for the best. “NO RETURN.”\n\nI wonder if the old lady driving away could hear my growl of anger as she drove up the road. \n",

        "text": "Well in an attempt to bring some humor to the world I will share this story with you.\n\nI was working as a Military Police officer on a relatively small base.  I was walking to work from the barracks and I notice two gentlemen at one of the BBQ Pits wearing kilts.  Now being new and also in charge of enforcing the dress code to a certain extent and I file that away as a question to ask my NCO's about. (For the record it's not authorized unless you're celebrating a Scottish ethnic event)\n\nBeing one of the newer guys I get stuck on the Main Gate. 12 hour shift on a Friday night and I get to stand outside and watch everyone leave and come back from their fun out in town.  I remember my Kilt friends and consciously start looking for them so I can tell them they need to go change.\n\nAs curfew approaches I get the usual rush of cabs as people scramble to beat curfew.  During this rush I spot one of the guys in the kilt and inform him that he needs to change.  I send him on his way knowing full well that he is going to ignore me but not having the time to care.\n\nThe rush dies down and I go back to pacing because there is so much going on.  About two hours later I realize that I had only seen one of the two kilt guys come through.  This is not a huge revelation.  There is nothing saying that the other kilt guy left base, although it's doubtful that he didn’t.  I let it leave my brain and continue my pacing.\n\n30 minutes after I have my thought about the second kilt guy a lone taxi rolls up to the main gate.  This is peculiar but not unheard of.  I don't notice anyone in the back seat and it is past time where cabs come on base for fares.  He pulls up and hands me his ID and jerks a thumb towards the backseat.  I look in the back and there he is, passed out drunk, wearing his kilt.\n\nWell now I have a few options. I can write the curfew violation or even a drunk in public.  In the spirit of community policing and knowing full well that his barracks duty is going to throw the book at him I decide to do the bare minimum and check his ID.  I shake him awake and he looks at me with unfocused eyes as I ask for his ID. (It's important to note that he has no bag with him and no apparent way to store anything.  I’m new and this didn’t process at the time). He starts tapping his waist right around the belly button.  He extends his empty hand towards me as if his hand is not open.  I tell him that there is nothing in his hand and I need his ID.  He opens up one eye looks at his empty hand and waves me off and passes back out.\n\nI am entirely too new to handle this situation so I call a road unit to come and assist me while having the taxi driver pull over into the parking lot.  The road unit arrives and we stand this guy up behind the taxi so he couldn't keep passing out.  We ask him multiple more times for his ID really not wanting to cause any more trouble than what he is already in.  He ends up getting very agitated and in a moment of clarity suggests we check the back seat in case it fell out of his kilt. We humor him and go to check the backseat.  The cab driver has detached his back seat and is holding at a military port arms in a gesture of \"There is nothing in the backseat.\"  We look anyway. There was nothing in the back seat.\n\nWe return to the Kilt and ask him one more time if he has his ID.  He gets angry and grabs the front of his kilt and rips it off screaming “LET ME CHECK!”  As he rips the kilt away and holds it straight out to his side we notice that in true Scottish fashion he is going commando.  He squats down a little looks at his business and shouts “Nope. I got nothing!”  We tell him to put his kilt back on as we are very near to a family apartment building. He keeps shouting so we grab his kilt and wrap it around him and connect the two strips of Velcro that hold the kilt tight around the waist.  This is the final straw. No more nice MPs.\n\nWe tell the Kilt to turn around and face the taxi and get him into the handcuffing position.  Orders dictate that we handcuff for any kind of transport.  He complies until we get the first cuff on at which point he tries resisting and we have to slam him on the trunk of the taxi.  He continues to resist as we get the second cuff on.  As we try escorting him to the patrol car he steps up his resistance to trying to pull away from the road MP.  I walk to the other side and grab his other bicep so he quits trying to run.  He proceeds to go limp and we have to carry him, one MP on each arm, as he kicks like a four year old throwing a temper tantrum as his parents rush him out of Wal-Mart.\n\nWe get him to the car and get him in the back.  Orders now dictate that we put on his seatbelt.  My partner pushes his head away to prevent being bitten and attempts to secure the buckle.  Kilt realizes this is really happening and goes for the final resistance.    He does the only resistance he can with his head trapped by my partner and his legs trapped by the spacious rear seat of a patrol car, he starts bucking his hips in an air humping motion.  Not being professional Kilt wearers we failed to secure his kilt correctly.  When the hip thrusting commences his kilt promptly falls off.  He is now pant less thrusting his hips towards my partner face as he is still trying to buckle the seatbelt.  I run around to the side of the car assist in the buckling.  We fight with this guy for a few minutes because his hip thrusts are engaging the seatbelt lock and we have to keep letting the seatbelt roll up to disengage it.\n\nFinally we get it secured and I throw up my hands and shout “Clear!” and my partner does the same.  Kilt now realizes this is his last chance and fills his lungs to maximum capacity and screams to the now partially awake apartment building, some of whom are rubbernecking, “RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPE!”  Now we have this guy who is pant-less and handcuffed in the backseat of the squad car yelling this.  IA, please come on down.\n\nMy partner takes him back to the station and I go back to standing my gate.  Come to find out later that he was uncooperative at the station to and got put in the drunk tank.  As our shift ends and I am giving my statement of the events to my Watch Commander, Kilt is sitting in the lobby, sober-ish, waiting for his command to come and get him. He unvelcros his kilt just a little bit and inside is a little zipper pocket that is the same color as the fabric of his kilt.  He unzips it and pulls out his ID, Credit Card, and money.  All the stuff you need for a night out on the town AND to avoid the now Drunk in Public and Resisting Arrest charges. \n\nSome kilts have zipper pouches in the front.  Laugh and Learn from my story.

        "text": "It was the end of my shift and my relief was dragging his feet at the station, typical of the evening shift at my station at the time. I was dispatched to a drunk call in a residential neighborhood - a guy was stumbling around an apartment complex (a notoriously bad one), half naked and sweaty - and I realized there was no one available to back me up.\n\nI told the dispatcher I'd go-it alone (drunk calls were very frequent and usually quickly resolved) and promptly arrived on-scene. The guy had wandered off from the area the initial complainant had reported him so I exited my cruiser and walked around looking for him. I got about a block away when I saw a lady hiding just inside her window, obviously scared and pointing towards another building. I walked towards the entrance and found the guy, still drunk but not happy-go-lucky, slurred speech and giggles drunk. No, this guy was pissed. He saw me coming through the window of the entrance and qucikly came out into the courtyard. He said something I couldn't make out and pulled out a large butcher knife from his waist band.\n\nNow, in the academy we were taught about the \"21 foot rule.\" The TL;DR version is this: if someone is within 21 feet of you with a knife, they can cover that ground and stab you before you can draw and accurately fire your weapon. This guy was 15 feet away, tops, and angry.\n\nI drew my firearm and leveled at him with one hand, whie attempting to call for back-up on my shoulder mounted radio mic. The problem was, buried so deep among those building, I had no radio reception, just the dreaded, low \"beeeeeep\" of doom. I started backing up while yelling at him to drop the knife (in both Spanish and English, thank-you-very-much) but that only seemed to further aggitate him and he started lurching towards me. I backed up and cleared the building to my rear and finally had reception enough to scream for help (hey, I was about to shoot this guy) on the radio. I was starting to pull past the slack on my gun, knowing it was totally justified but not yet wanting to kill the guy.\n\nAt that moment the scared woman in the window screamed at him in Spanish, crying and holding a child close to her chest. He turned and started arguing with her and I holstered up while rushing him, full-on Terry Tate style. I slammed him to the ground and had him cuffed before I even realized I had knocked him unconcious. My back-up arrived about 20 seconds later and the guy was cleared by an ambulance before being taken to jail. \n\nEventually we figured out his wife had caught him cheating and kicked him out. He went and got drunk, returned to the house and smacked her around. He tried to stab her with the knife but dropped it and she threw it out the window. His wife was the one who told me where he was when I first arrived. \n\nAlthough in hindsight, tackling a guy armed with a knife was probably the absolute wrong idea, I'm glad I was able to make that snap decision and solve the problem at hand. The guy was eventually deported and I didn't have to take a bunch of admin leave while being cleared for a shooting.\n",

        "text": "Back when I worked on the street I was parked car to car with a few buddies, catching up on paperwork. Over the radio, a crime scene detective asked for assistance from a patrolman nearby. This was very odd as crime scene usually brought enough guys with them to take care of anything. My friends and I quickly discussed who'd go help and I drew the short straw, although honestly, I was intrigued as to what was so important they'd need my help.\n\nFive minutes later I'm pulling up to an apartment building in a not so affluent neighborhood. I park near the crime scene vans and notice one of the detectives sitting in his truck, smoking a cigarette and looking out into the distance, obviously deep in thought. As I walk up to the other detective who's near his vehicle, he hands me elbow length nylon gloves and asks, \"Do you have a spare shirt at the station?\"\n\n\"Sure, why?\" I respond. \n\n\"You'll see.\" was his cryptic answer. \n\n\"What's with him?\" I ask, gesturing to the other detective who was still looking at something on the horizon.\n\n\"Couldn't take it.\" \n\nNow my interest is piqued. I glove up and follow the detective to the back of the building. He's awkwardly silent the whole way and I don't really understand what's going on. He points to a trail (barely a trail, more like a parting of brambles and sapplings) in some woods and says, \"Get your flashlight out for me. You're leading the way.\"\n\nI follow his directions and make the appropriate turns, penetrating about 20 yards into dense woods, thorns grabbing my clothes and grasshoppers scattering on my approach. \"Brace yourself, he's right over there, by that big tree.\" \n\nMy flashlight beam lights up some clothing piled next to an ancient oak tree. They look soaked and there are flies and beetles all over them. He open a jar of vapor rub, applies a smear to his upper lip, then passes to me, suggesting with a nod I do the same. It burns my nostrils but I figure he knows what he's doing. He then walks, halfheartedly, to the clothing and nudges the pile at the top. A half eaten face rolls back and settles to one side of a pale white, blotchy neck. The detective lifts up the dead guys arm and maggots come puring out of the long sleeve. You can clearly make out bones on the back of the hand and when he flops the arms into the guy's lap, the palms look like they had been in water for a few hours -pale and wrinkly.\n\n\"You take the legs, I'll get the heavy side. Once he's up, we're bee-lining it out, fuck the path. Watch for thorns because we're going to move quick.\"\n\nI reluctantly picked up the ankles, squishy through damp jeans, and try to do my part in lifting the guy out of his resting apot. It had rained recently and through my latex gloves the water felt ice cold. The detective grunted as he allowed the head rest on his chest but didn't re-adjust, just began walking backwards out of the woods. It was tough going, dark and root ridden. Once I almost stumbled and a flash of tripping and landing on this decomposing corpse flashed through my head. We finally exited the brush, panting and sweaty, the spicy sweet vapor rub melting into my mouth from my lip, and lay the man on the grass. The detective told me to \"Wait here\" and walked away, cursing to himself under his breath. \n\nIt's a strange thing to stand by a corpse, alone but surrounded by the sounds of kids laughing, the smells of dinners being prepared, life going on as if nothing was amiss. I used my flashlight to see the guy more clearly. His shirt had pulled up where the detective had gripped him around the torso and his flesh was mottled and pale. He was slightly bloated and his stomach was sticking out in a way that made it hard to tell if he was overweight or if it was just the gasses building up. His lips and most of his chin were missing, exposing his teeth and jawbone. Both eyes were gone (apparently they're the first to go) and his one hand was clearly chewed up by something. His other hand was fine, slightly discolored but still wearing a cheap Timex watch. \n\nThe detective returned with a body bag and opened it next to the man. He grabbed both shoulders and looked at me expectanly until I took my place again at the ankles, placing the body gently into the bag. He then checked the pockets, found a wet cell phone and wallet, and took out the guy's ID. He then removed his gloves, retrieved a camera and started snapping pictures. \n\nI learned later the guy had become despondent by the break upwith his girlfriend. His roommates saw him drinkning heavily in his room and had heard the crash when he jumped out the window of the room he rented in a nearby home. Officers found several empty pill bottles and an empty bottle of bleach in the room along with several empty bottles of alcohol. He made it several blocks away before finding the tree in the secluded woods behind the apartment. The helo couldn't find him that first night due to the foliage and search parties never looked in the right area. It was over a week before the cadaver dog followed the scent to the woods.\n\nAnd that's the day I decided crime scene wasn't for me. \n",

My two buddies roll up and start to enter the backyard when the guy sees them and takes off. They give chase, calling a foot pursuit for what they thought was a potential burglar. \n\nNow, one of my buddies was super-fit, former college athlete, triathlon competitor, etc. The other was a lanky goof ball, never having learned the proper way to deal with people in the day-to-day interactions of a road dog. \n\nIn-shape guy keeps giving updates and doesn't sound stressed on the radio but goof ball keeps updating on top of him, gassed and clearly freaking out a little. To this day, I'm not sure what thought entered his head that what he was about to do was in everyone's best interest, but mid-stride, dude takes out his pepper spray and takes aim at the back of the fleeing subject's head.\n\nIn-shape guy sees this and veers away, still in the chase but needing a better, less dangerous vantage to watch what is about to unfold. Goof ball gives a final yell of \"Stop, police!\" and lets loose an entire can of spray. In-shape guy is out of the path, but unfortunately so is the target. Instead, the spray reaches the end of its trajectory and poofs into a mist, trailing right back into the gasping yaw of goof ball. He starts gagging and goes down like a giraffe with its legs tied together, cursing and yelling at no one in particular. In-shape guy starts laughing, losing a step on the bad guy but unable to control himself. \n\nLuckily, the kid saw this all go down too and in an act of either amazed disconnect with his current status as flee-er or utter pity for the spectacle he just observed, he stopped about 20 yards ahead of the chase. He was promptly tackled and cuffed, later transported back to school with one hell of a story.\n",

        "text": "Living and working in a city with a few million inhabitants, a massivly overworked emergency system and one of the highest violent crime rates in the world life can get interesting at times.\n\nI know that overseas common practice, (and common sense) dictates that EMS only attend to violent scenes after PD has squared everything away. Down here we've been known to do things differently. This is a due to a combo of limited resources, stubborness and good ol' Saffa ~~bravery~~ idiocy.\n\nUsually we get away with it, limiting our time on scene + acting like we're in charge tend to keep most of the shit away from us but sometimes it doesn't.\n\n\nMy first experience of this was a few months after I qualified as a basic. We received a call for a maternity in one of the adjacent squatter camps. These are areas well known for violence but we get complacent when nothing happens for a while, maternity calls are very common in these places and we were rubbing the sleep from our eyes as we pulled out of the engine bay and headed into the camp.\nIt was around 3am on a Sunday and all but the hardest drinkers were in snoring in their gutters as we parked the ambulance on the small hill that serves as the de facto ambulance pick up point for that part of the squatter camp. It was eerily dark that night as the cloud cover was blocking any light from the moon so the light from our lightbar lit up the rough metal of the surrounding shacks in a harsh red flickering glare, in hindsight this level of visibility wasn't a great idea.\n\nWe noticed a few torches in the distance which seemed to point quite a bit at us, but we didn't think too much of it as they were quite far away. I musn't have been the only one feeling uneasy as my partner then turned the lights off. It was about that moment that we heard what sounded like a rifle shot and a flash went over our heads, we became one with the dirt behind the ambo and probably would've won any \"act like a little girl competitions\" Bearing in mind that the thickest thing either of us was wearing was a dept issue wooly jumper.\n\nMy partner looked me in the eyes and said \"I have a kid, I don't want to die\" which I thought set the tone nicely. A few looooong seconds later everything started turning blue and moments later 3 police vans shot past churning up dust as they headed in the direction of the shooting. I never found out what was happening that night. It could have been a drunkard mistaking us for police or some junkie taking potshots at the pretty lights but I was very, very happy to see the cops that night. \n\nWill upload more later/in the morning depending on energy levels.",

        "text": "Last year I got dispatched to a report of an abandoned suspicious vehicle. It was reported to be parked off of a canal bank that runs through an industrial area in my beat. I have to drive down the canal about a half-mile off the road to get to it. As I arrive to see a small silver SUV parked maybe 20 yards off of the canal against the back wall of one of the large warehouses. The walls probably 12 to 15 feet high. We are nearly a half-mile from any road. And there is absolutely no reason for a car to be here.\n\nI park at a distance, get out, and slowly approach on foot. All the trees and shrubs in this area are severely overgrown because nobody landscapes plants next to a canal. As I start walking up to the car my first thought is people having sex. My second thought is there will be a dead body inside. I figure the only reason somebody drives this far off the beaten path is because they want to be alone. Either alone with their partner, or alone with their misery.\n\nI get closer and can start catching glimpses of the interior of the car. Little by little, inch by inch, I get a clear view of what's inside. By the time I get up to the door I realize the vehicle is unoccupied. This bothers me almost more than if I had found someone inside.\n\nFine, this must be stolen and dumped. I run the plate and compare it to the VIN. Both match. And it's not listed as stolen. None of this is making sense. There's no reason for a car to be out here, there's nobody inside, it's not stolen, and I don't see anyone around.\n\nAnd that's when I get the feeling. That feeling at the base of your skull where your hairline meets your neck. That feeling that nothing is okay. That feeling that you need to immediately change the situation things are going to go bad.\n\nThe trees around here are shaped like canopies. Tents that grow up, and then back down to the ground, creating concealed shelters where anyone could be hiding. And they could see out far easier than I could see in. Right now I don't know if the driver of this car is trying to elude detection, intent on harming himself, or intent on harming me.\n\nI step back to my patrol car call for second unit. I wait until maybe partner shows up.\n\nMike shows up and I kind of explain to him what I've got going on. Basically this mystery car and no explanation for why it's here. I'm not even really sure what I expect to find. The dead driver? Or living one? Maybe a drug overdose. Maybe drug overdose that hasn't died yet. A kidnap, or rape. Or just some kids who can't afford a hotel and are trying to get away from their parents.\n\nWe position our patrol cars on either side of the SUV so that it can't leave while we are walking around. Then we start walking parallel to the canal trying to figure out what the hell it's doing here.\n\nAbout 200 yards away we approach of thicket of trees. I can start to see unnatural colors underneath it. Reds, purple's reflective oranges, etc. we slowed to a crawl. Advancing slowly, we take in everything that our new vantage point offers us before taking another step. Chairs, a table, bags, clothes, a bicycle...\n\nTurns out some homeless guy realized that these trees make a pretty good shelter. He has set himself up what basically amounts to a two bedroom apartment underneath the canopy of green. There is a clear kitchen area, as well as a bedroom. In fact, it appears that this guy might actually own more than I do. And his vantage point is great. From the canal, where bicyclist, joggers, and runners get their daily exercise the trees completely obscure his campsite. But if you walk around to the side between the trees and the 15 foot wall there's an opening that you can walk through to get inside. And based on the amount of growth on the tree I'm willing to bet that it offers quite a bit protection from the rain as well.\n\nBut alas, he is not home. And somehow I don't feel that this is his car.\n\nWe walk nearly a third of a mile before we hit some railroad tracks, and give up. On our return to our vehicles we chat about just how weird this is. We both worked here for around seven years. We've never encountered a vehicle along the canal. It just doesn't make any sense. What the hell are they doing here?\n\nDispatch gets back to me and lets me know that they're unable to contact the registered owner. Even the agency that went to the house listed on the registration got no answer.\n\nSeeing as how I'm not quite ready to give up yet I decide to kick around underneath the trees closest to the car. And that's when I see it.\n\nUnder one of the heavy canopies just against a raised area there's a pile of river rock. But they are not placed there arbitrarily. These rocks of been piled up, stacked neatly. The pile was about 28 inches long, 18 inches wide, and maybe 10 inches tall. And a makeshift cross had been placed at the head of it. Jesus Christ, what did we just stumble into?\n\nMike starts moving rocks. I have this quick flash of an idea that maybe we should get a camera out here and document the excavation. But Mike says we should figure out what it is before we do that, and continues moving one rock at a time. \n\nRock after rock is carefully set aside and I can start to see the blue color appear. As Mike slowly reveals what the rocks were concealing he is more deliberate in his selection of which rock to move next. Over the course of 3 minutes or so, he exposes what I recognize as a dirty, stained, light blue towel wrapped up like bunting.  \"Oh, fuck me, Mike. What the hell did we find?\"\n\nMike, from his squated position, looks up at me with sunken eyes. \n\n\"Mike, I don't think we should go any further. I think we need to call Sarge.\"\n\n\"I want to know what's inside.\"\n\n\"What? Fuck you. That's a fucking baby. That's a fucking dead baby, wrapped in a fucking towel, buried next to a fucking canal!\"\n\nMy mind is absolutely racing. Why the fuck is a baby buried out here? Did we just stumble onto a homicide? Is this one of those \"teenage girl has a baby in the bathroom at prom\" kind of situations? How long has it been here? And what the fuck does that silver SUV have to do with any of it. \n\nAnd that fucker keeps going! Mike pulls out a pair of latex gloves and snaps them over his fingers. He grabs the exposed corner of the towel and slowly starts peeling it back. You can tell it's been here a while because it's kind of crusty. It's stiff. The way a towel get when it gets wet repeatedly without properly drying in between. Dust, dirt, and bits of organic matter peel and crackle off of it as he starts to move it back. And that's when I smell it. \n\nIf you've ever smelled that, you know exactly what I'm talking about. The second it hits your nose you know exactly what you found. If you haven't I'll do my best to describe it. It's musky. It's heavy. It's slightly sweet, but not in a good way. It affects your stomach the way no other odor does. It clings to your nostrils and lays heavy on your tongue. It's death. And there's no mistaking it.  \n\nMike is visibly taken aback by the all-too-familiar smell that first responders know intimately. But he keeps going. Slowly, gingerly, and with as little disturbance as he can he moves to towel back. And as he does I can see what's behind it. \n\nSickly fragrance is heavy in the air all around us now. Like the breeze died down just so it could linger. It gets the best of me and I start to choke down today's breakfast. Maybe it was because it was a baby. Maybe it was because we were already here on a creepy call to begin with. Or maybe I just didn't want to be in this circumstance right now. But I was desperate to get out of this. I would've done anything I could just to call in sick right now. I wanted that  scent off of me. \n\nUnderneath the faded terrycloth towel was what I recognized as grocery bag. Thin, crinkly, white grocery bag. \n\nMike looked at the bag and looked up at me. He knew it had to be done. We both did. I just don't know if I was willing to admit it at the time. We had to keep going.\n\n\"Oh, jesus, Mike. What the fuck did we get in to?\" \n\nMike reaches for his pocket knife. \n\n\"Fucking shit, man. I don't want to see this.\"\n\nHe unfold the blade. \n\n\"Seriously Mike, I do not want to see this. This is fucked. This is all fucked.\"\n\nHe places the steel against the bag. I turn away. \n\n\"What's in the bag, Mike? What's in the fucking bag?\"\n\nI can hear metal cutting plastic. The rustle of noise that only grocery bags make. My eyes are clenched shut, my hands on my face. \n\n\"What the fuck is in the bag, Mike? Is it bad? What's in there?\"\n\nMike lets out a long breath. \"Fuck me.\"\n\n\n\"Its a cat.\"\n\n\"What?!?\" I turn and stare. \n\n\"It's a fucking cat, dude.\"\n\nI see gray fur everywhere. It's exploding from the bag, and catching a ride on the breeze. \n\nA fucking cat. \n\nAnd we start to laugh. Like deep guttural howling laughter. The kind of laughter you only get after you and a good friend think you found a dead baby concealed by a canal bank, but it turns out just to be a loved and lost family pet.  The best kind if laughter, if you ask me. \n\nMike wraps the little fluff ball back up in his burial shroud. And together we reassemble his grave. \n\nNever did find out what that car was doing there. Turns out that easement is owned by the gas company, so we called them and let them tow the car out of there.\n\nMike and I still work that area. We still talk about that call. We still laugh our asses off over how worked up we got over one dead cat.\n \n\n",

        "text": "Sometimes I think about where I came from, and where I would be if I wasn't a cop. First off, I would have a 5 inch blue mohawk. I would wear only dirty torn jeans, I would would bring my skateboard everywhere. I would hang out at the mall, and run from security. I would. It's who I am.\n\nPicture the quintesential cop. 25, male, white. Short buzzed hair, built, stonch republican. Listens to AM radio. Likes \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" Hates vagrants, homosexuals, and nehr do wells. That's not me.\n\nMy IPod has more punk music than anything else. I ride a skateboard. I hate sports. My 1 year old son has a mohawk that makes me jealous. I have tattoos. Quite a few in fact. I shop at Industrial Ride Shop, Anchor Blue, and Pac Sun. Really, I think I'm 17.\n\nBut. I think that's what makes me good at what I do. Because when the mall rats get complaints, other cops try to shoo them off to somewhere else. Move the problem. A band aid on a broken bone. When I see the mall rats, they call to me, by name or badge number. They come running up for handshakes and stories. I talk to them. Rationaly. I explain that if they keep acting ike jack asses, they will run out of places to hang out. If they follow the simplest of guidelines, they can learn to live in harmony with adults. I also tell them that every time I have to exit my car to yell at them, I have to write paper. If I have to write paper, I have to stay late. If I have to stay late, I can't go home and play HALO 2 on XBOX. Now they get it. Now they care.\n\nRoots. They let me empathise with the runaway, who thinks that home is the worst place in the world. They let me understand why the kids at the mall have black hair, and pink hair, and pierced lips, and baggy clothes with more buckles and zippers than a hiking backpack. It lets me understand why they cut themselves, and smoke at 14. And you know what? That's what makes it work.\n\nInstead of running them off. I hang out with them. For hours at a time. I talk music, and gossip, and other bullshit. And then, when someones a runnaway, who do they tell. You're damn right! \n\nExample. Couple weeks ago a 14 year old girl ran away. Again. And I mean AGAIN. And I'm trying to find her. I approach my minion of mall rats and get the word out. I want her found, and home, and safe. This happened on my friday. On the follwoing day, one of them sees her. He calls the station. Im not there. What does he do? He get's her into his car, and drives her to the friggin PD, walks into the lobby, and says Officer Forensicunit said that she needs to go home. He brought me a fucking runaway!\n\nOfficers are proud of their c.i.'s. As well they should be. And I have my own variety. The 13-20 year olds that hang at the mall, and piss off the adults. And when a 19 year old is sleeping with a 14 year old, they tell me. And when one of them is way too deep into drugs, they find me. And when a runaway shows up at the bus stop, they call me. Why? Cause I remember my roots. I remember being 15, and being awkward, and being socially inept. I remember hating adults, and the system, and anything I could hate. I remember having no money, no car, no where to go. But I also remember the officer who found me ditching school. The one who didn't arrest me. Didn't call my parents. Didn't lecture me. He just put me in his car, and drove me back to school. Where I belonged in the first place.\n\nBeing a cop is a powerful thing. You can destroy people's lives, in a hearbeat. Financialy, socialy, psychologicaly. With a simple decision of whether to cite or not, whether to book or not, whether to warn or not. You hold great power when you come to work each day. ",

        "text": "This is one of my old man's stories from his time on a small town police department about 30 years ago. \n\nThe night is slow, as usual in one horse southern Ga towns such as ours, with my pops and his partner sitting in the drug store parking lot waiting for nothing to happen. Some time passes and an old Chevy truck halfway blows the red light, stops in the middle of the intersection, and reverses back to wait out the light. Naturally, this arouses the suspicion of 2 bored cops watching it all happen. Dad pulls out in his box Crown Vic and hits the lights on the roof. Guy in the truck floors it. The pursuit takes them a couple miles out of town and the perp turns down a dirt road with the law right on his tail. Suddenly, the truck slams on the brakes and comes to an abrupt halt. Pops has to do the same in his patrol car and ends up having to slide it at an angle to avoid plowing into the stopped truck in front of him. Meanwhile, both the pissed driver of the truck and my dad's partner have emerged from their respective vehicles and are quickly closing the gap between each other. The suspect is highly agitated and intends to fight his way out of the situation. As the 2 parties converge, the suspect delivers a bone crushing field goal kick straight to the nuts of my dad's partner. He goes down, hard, holding his baby gravy reservoirs and is out of the fight. By this time, my old man has made it around the patrol car that was hastily slid into position and manages to catch the suspect with a running forearm to the face, albeit a second too late to save his partner's balls from crushing destruction. The momentum of the maneuver somehow puts the 2 of them into the driver floorboard of the guys truck, with his will to fight still very much there. At this point, a weapon of opportunity presents itself to my father: the clutch pedal. With the perp pinned as best he can manage, my old man starts manually smashing the clutch into this guys head and face. Eventually, the partner gathers himself from the dirt and lends a \"helpful\" hand securing the driver. After a brief trip to the hospital for some needle and thread therapy for our crazed motorist, he finally makes it to jail. \n\nOne of the entertaining stories I've heard over the years from my dad.",

        "text": "\nMost of the people I know try to teach their kids that cops are good. Cops are the people you call when you need help. If you are lost at the mall, find a police officer. Cops are to be looked up to and respected. They always do the right thing.\n\nAnd yet, sometimes the right thing is the hardest, and from a childs eyes, meanest thing you can do.\n\nTonight, some guy got in a fight with his g/f. It got ugly. He broke her garage door. She threw his son's piggie bank on the front lawn, shattering it. They slap each other around, and then he gets in his car with his 4 year old son, William, and drives away. Another officer pulls him over a mile away. We talk to him, we talk to her. They BOTH broke the law. They BOTH committed criminal damage and assault. And they BOTH did it in front of young William. Now while the other officer is interviewing dad at the side of the road, young William starts to get out of the car, on a major road. I rush over, usher him back into the car, and spend some time talking to him. \n\nWIlliam is 4. He's maybe 3 feet tall, and cant weigh more than 60 pounds. He's wearing shorts. Only shorts. It's too hot for a shirt and dad said he didnt need shoes (his words). I agree. Most little boys don't need shirts or shoes. I tell him to sit in the drivers seat, and he tells me he not old enought to drive. He's adorable.\n\nWilliam goes on to tell me, in a lispy hard to understand 4 year old tone, that dad and his g/f fight all the time. He tells me that dad burns her books, and that she broke his piggie bank. She took all of William's pennies and wont give them back. She also stole all of dad's money. I asked him why she took his money....his reply? Because she's a bitch (pronounce Bitss if you are four). This little boy has absorbed all the violence, all the hate, all the anger, and all the name calling. 4 year olds shouldn't be telling you that dad's g/f gets \"all pissed off\" all the time.\nBy this time, the other officer determins that not only did dad commit domestic violence, but he's also impaired due to alcohol, and driving. With William in the car. Dad needs to go to jail. He has to. The law is written that way. We no longer have a choice. We walk dad away from his car, behind mine, and place him in cuffs. He get's put in a car, and I make arrangements for William for the night. A baby sitter.\n\nI return to the car, where William has tears streaming down his face, and is sobbing relentlessly. I ask him whats wrong. He tells me he wants his dad. I tell him that dad needs to hang out with us for a while, but I arranged a sleep over with his baby sitter. And he cries.\nThe other officer leaves with dad. I stay with William. He is beside himself with tears. I open the door and reach to him. He climbs up my arms like a little chimp. I've never been held by a cop, but it cant be the greatest. Theres the gun, and the cold badge, and the radio, and all the other pokey things on the belt. But I try. I hold William, and tell him every thing will work out. And he cries. He cries and cries. He cries and repeats \"Daddy\".....\"Daddy\".......\"Daddy\" over and over again. He cries and calls out so loud, that when I try to ask for another unit to help me, my dispatcher cant hear me over his cries. And I pace, and I bounce, and I pet his hair. And I whisper, and I touch my forehead to his, and I rub his back. And he cries. And he wants his dad.\n\nAnd here I am, at 1 am, on the side of a road, in the red and blue strobe of a big steel cruiser, dressed in black, with more accessories than a barby play house on my belt, holding this shirtless, sobbing, tearfull 4 year old boy, who wants nothing other than his father. And I start to cry. And I feel like shit. And I want my son. And I want so desperatly for his dad not to have fucked up so badly. And while he repeats his cries for his dad, I hold his head close, and tell him \"It's going to be okay.\" And he sniffs, and says \"Okay.\" But it's not. And he knows it, and I know it. And we walk on the sidewalk, as I hold him, and we cry. And nothing is okay.\nBecause this 4 year old sponge, who knows that Dad and his g/f fight, and knows that she is a bitch, and knows that she has his pennies, now also knows that the cops took his father away from him. And he will never forget it.\n\nThe baby sitter shows up, and takes young William from me. And in a way, I really don't want to let go. I want to keep him, and tell him it will be better. I want to be there when dad get's back, so I can show him that it did get better. And the baby sitter tells me that mom left when he 6 months old.....and I choke. Dad is all this kid has. And I took him away from him. \n\nOr did I? No, dad left left. Dad fucked up. Dad made a series of horrible decisions. Dad decided to fight, to follow his g/f home, to fight, to get out of his car, to fight, and then to return to his car, where he put his life, William's life, and everyone elses life in danger, by driving drunk. And that's why he's gone now.\n\nBut try to explain that to William. Who can't even pronounce book yet, but will always remember the day those cops dressed in black came and took his dad away from him.\n\nSo, who's the asshole now? I guess it depends on how old you are.\n",

        "text": "So, I get dispatched to a domestic type call. 14 year old acting out. Which, by the way, I never understood. Anyone under the age of 18 is not having a domestic, they are having a parenting issue. Seriously, I got sent to a call once...\"7 and 9 year old fighting. Out of control. Mom requests police assistance.\" Assistance in what? Telling her kids that she is obviously an unfit mother because she can't manage to keep a 7 and 9 year old in check? So I get there, and she tells me the kids have been going at it ever since school got out. I sit Frick and Frack down, and do a hover right over them kind of stance, and ask what they are fighting about. This ladies and gentlemen, is the best part. Is it attention from mom? No. Is it a girl? No. Is it homework, clothing, friends, who has to do what chores? No! Its God Damn Pokemon Cards! Pokemon Cards! This lady just called a police officer to her house, at nine thirty at night, because she is too inept to take her 7 and 9 year old sons, slap them across the face, send them to their rooms sans dinner, and temporarily or better yet, permanently, confiscate the Pokemon cards. I lost my shit. I laid in to Frick, then I laid in to Frack, and then I laid in to mom. I basically told her that if she doesnt start disciplining, like yesterday, then her kids are going to be stealing cars by age 13. And yes, I do believe that's true. I seriously do not understand parents that let their kids run the house. But, that's probably another story all together. \n\nAnyway, as I head down to the residence, the officer who is getting on scene tells me that two boys just jumped the fence from a community to a main road. However he doesn't know if they are related, as he has not yet made contact. He ask me to check out the boys, and determine their involvement in the scuffle we were responding to. Here is where geography, or at least traffic engineering, fucked me. As I proceed southbound, I cross an overpass to a freeway. On the other side of the freeway, I see two boys in black, on the east side of the road. However, there is as huge median in the road, that my little Crown Vic will not cross. I continue south, with the intention of turning around at the next intersection. As I pass the boys, one starts into a sprint, northbound. Oh yeah, these are the guys. I haul south, flip on lights and sirens, make a U-turn, that is more like a J-turn, with ass end flying around and screaming, and gun it northbound again.....to the one kid that is walking up the road. Crap.\n\nI jump out and put the Habeas Grabbas on him. He tells me that his friend and his friend's mom got in a fight, and they left the house. When they saw me his buddy takes off like a bat out of hell, jumps down off the side of the road (since we were on the approach to an overpass) about 12 feet, into a greenbelt. And he's gone. So instantly, I get the channel, and about 5 more units at my disposal. We set up a pretty darn tight perimeter, pretty quickly. And the K9 comes in. \n\nI will spare you the next 25 minutes of sheer boredom. But, 25 minutes later, the K9 asks for a unit at a residence. I can see the K9 officer from where I am, because I am on the embankement to the overpass, and have an elevation advantage. I figure I can run to him faster than anyone can navigate the neighborhood in their vehicle. \n\nI run to him, and he makes a gesture with his hands. Now I'm not sign language certifed, nor do I usualy work with K9's or SWAT, so I'll try to translate. He gestures a straight index finger \"I think he's behind that wall.\" I return with a curved index finger making an arch \"Uhm, you want me to climb over the wall?\" He replies with an aggravated nod \"Yeah, dumbass, how else are we going to get in?\" I flare out my fingers and make a pushing away from me motion indicating \"Fine, but make sure you dog doesnt confuse me with dinner on the way over!\" \n\nSo, I hop up on the wall and over, and immediately see our little 14 year old friend cowering in the corner. \"POLICEDONTMOVEPOLICEPUTYOURHANDSUPWHEREICANSEETHEMPOLICEDONTMAKEADAMNMOVE!\" Now mind you, I'm yelling police every 3 seconds for a couple of reasons. A) If this kid's a moron, and things go south, I want to be able to say that I clearly identified myself as an officer numerous times. and B) if the happy homeowners of the residence in who's backyard I am currently standing wakes up, I want them to know that despite the fact that I am wearing black and Im lurking in their back yard, they should not shoot me! I prone him out, pin him down, and cuff him up. \n\nIt is at this point that I hear our K9 barking over the wall behind me. This, and my yelling, has gotten the attention of the canines that live in this particular residence. They too are barking. Our K9 barks, and the dogs inside bark louder. Our K9 barks, and the dogs inside get even louder. Our K9 barks, and. . . the . . . dog . . . door. . . . opens. . . . . . fuck!\n\nLet me set the mood. We have a 14 year old, lying, on his stomach, in some 1/2 inch granite, with his feet against a one wall in a corner, and the length of his body parallel to the other wall in the corner. He is wearing a pair of Smith and Wesson Handcuffs, and has an officer on his back. We have an officer, on someones back, in the corner of a yard, surrounded by a 6 foot wall, who is now in charge of the safety and security of his prisoner. And we have two of the biggest, and smartest German Shepherds I have ever seen, who have entered the back yard and taken up an L formation on me, blocking and escape route that does not involve a six foot wall. Oh yeah, and they are PISSED!\n\nSome options occur to me. First, it seems that they would most likely attack the face of my prisoner before they attack mine, since his face is much closer to theirs. This is not an ok option. So I start considering. Can I pick up homeboy, toss him over the wall (since a handcuffed 6 foot fall has to be better than being eaten alive by two Shepherds) and get over behind him, without leaving a permanent momento in this yard? \n\nI start yelling to the K9 officer on the other side of the wall \"Get the owner! Get the owner. Tell him to get his fucking dogs inside. Go!\" He runs around and rigns the door bell. And presto, their little dog ears turn like NORAD radar and they know \"Hey! If the doorbell rings, there is someone to eat outside of it!\" Chooper and Killer run back inside and start barking furiously at the front door. K9 says, no one is answering. But at this point I don't give a fuck. I reply \"Just keep ringing.\" And he does. As he distracts the doggies, my 14 year old Olympic runner and I make it around the house to a side gate, and then proceed on the 1/4 mile hike back top my car. \n\nAll in all an intersting night. One K9 made my day, and two canines almost ruined my day. \nBut like I say every Friday at midnight....Any day I come home in one piece, is a succesfull day.\n",

And I still claim to this day that only two death investigations have ever \"gotten to me.\" See my December entries for details on that mess.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the other things don't stay with me. Last night there was a motorcycle wreck, where the rider was literally torn in half, and his heart left his body, and flew down the road. Pretty crazy. I didn't go, but I heard about it. Because we talk about that kind of shit. And everyone wants to hear it. So I got to thinking about just how grotesque that must have been. And then, on my long desert road drive home, my mind began to wander again.\n\nAnd I started to think about those last seconds of life. Those last terrifying, panicked, horrible moments in a persons life. Shortly before they are ran over, sucked in, torn, ripped, squashed, cut, alone, scared, confused, and dying. And I wonder what that must be like. And then I think that hopefully there is a built in mechanism, like a surge protector, that prevents your brain from even receiving the overload of pain and emotion. And I start to think about specific cases, and how much I hope that they didn't hurt. And I think. And I think.\n\nAnd I think about child who was run over by a fork lift, and roofer who fell to the ground, and construction worker who was sucked into an auger, and girl who ran herself over, and decomposing guy on white leather couch, and old man on the toilet, and little girl in the wheel well, and suicide behind the mortuary, and mummified lady, and teenage boy in the fire-bird, and guy who was shot at the Mexican restaurant, and wife duct taped to bed, and smoke shop employee, and t-boned kid in the burning car, and suicide by shotgun at the airport, and lady in hospice, and baseball player who was dumped, and 21 day old baby, and those three Hispanic ladies, and cheerleader with asthma. And I just want them to know. I never forgot. I never forget about them. And I hope those last seconds where, in some slow motion in front of a fast background, in some overload of serotonin and adrenaline, in some coming to terms way, peaceful and painless.\n\nAs we share stories, please be mindful that everyone was someones son or daughter. Be respectful, both in the tales and the comments. Because they live on in someones memory.  As they should. ",

Several times she reached for my crotch, trying to make me let go of her, there I was hanging on for dear life to the one free handcuff, not wanting to be the brunt of all of the jokes if she broke away from me and I lost my cuffs.  Then it hit me, I took the one free cuff and slapped it on my own wrist, now she was handcuffed to me, we both paused, looked at each other and started laughing, she said wow, that was a good one. I walked her over to the patrol car, secured her properly and took her on to booking, all the way we laughed and talked about how I out smarted her this time and next time she was going to get away.

        "text": "So there I am, minding my own business, when I get dispatched to a fight call. It's a typical fight \"20-30 juvies fighting.\" Seriously people, don't you understand that it's 2 kids fighting and 28 spectators? But I digress. I'm right around the corner, and I get there pretty quick. As soon as I pull up to the park, the scatter like roaches in the light. \n\nNow, let me tell you real quick...if I get to a juvenile fight, and everyone runs, the way I see it, my job is done. I don't go chasing people for this kind of shit. It's a waste of time. I'll grab one kid, stop him, ask him what happened, and pretty much let it go at that....unless there's bleeding.\nAs I pull up, I see this white car ahead of me, and it takes off pretty quick. I decide that'll be my kid. I hit lights, and sirens (it makes the runners run faster, and makes me giggle), and the guy pulls to the right. I pull my car around his, and cut him off at a 45 degree angle, just to get my point across. I step out of my car, and turn to tell the guy to turn off his car, or whatever, when I realize the driver is getting out of the car, and running away from me. Mother Fucker. Did I already mention that I don't care to chase people for this shit? \n\nAs I'm making the decision of whether or not to give chase, I realize I see movement ot my left. I turn, still standing in the doorway of my car, and I see this shit bags car. It's moving. Toward my car. And there's no fucking driver. Awesome.\n\nI pretty much just stand there, and watch this asshole's car run right into mine. Fuck. Well, now I pretty much gotta chase him, huh? As I turn to catch the little shit, I realize that there are still 30 other punks milling about, and my car isn't exactly \"secure.\" I turn again, roll up my window (which takes forever by the way), and grab my key. Now I'm ready to run.\n\nWell by now, he's got like a 100 yard head start on me. This isn't gonna be fun at all. But he hit my car. He can't do that and get away with it. Not in front of 30 other shit heads. So I call it out, and I start to jog after him. I watch him jump one chain link fence, and then a second. He entered the campus of a catholic school. I see him running toward 3 faculty members and I yell \"Stop, Police!\" just so, you know, maybe they'd step in? Oh no. He runs right past them. \n\nI hit the first chain link fence and bound over it like a gazelle monkey. Gracefully I land on the other side and keep running. I get to the second chain link fence. This one doesn't have the same support bar along the top. It's just chain link. I move to the corner, and use the post as support. I start to climb, and put my right foot on top of the fence. I hoist with my hands, and....... Oh shit. The fence part gives, my left leg goes swinging wildly, and I grab on to that pole with all my hope, trying desperately not to give myself a vasectomy as my legs swing wildly through the air. As I regain some control, I find myslef with both hands on the pole, legs higher than my arms, and head pointed at the ground. As I swing my legs to the ground, all I can hear is \"Teeeeeeeaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr.\" Oh man! I just ripped my drawers! And by the sounds of it, a lot. \n\nI stand up and mutter a rather audible \"Mother fucker!\" I look up, and see that the staff member standing next to me is the priest. Oh yeah. Classy. I dropped the F bomb in front of the father. I look at him, and coyly smile. \"Looks like I'm getting new pants, is what I meant to say!\" :)\nI continued to chase, past school children and staff, as various faculty point me in the direction of the fleeing scallywag. After another turn or so, another officer cut him off and we arrested the little shit.\nThen I get to look at my pants. I tore them from inside the crotch, just under the left butt cheek, across to my left hip, and then down, nearly to the knee. A big ole flap that's hanging down. Not only that, but the tears also had tears in them. It seriously looked like Wolverine tried to date rape me. And I realize that all the school kids and teachers got to see half of my underpants and most of my left leg as I ran.\n\nAnd all I can think is \"Thank God, I am wearing clean, basic, black, boxer briefs.\" I have never been happier that I'm not into snake skin irridescent G-strings, or horribly dirty tighty whities.\n\nThe good news was, I caught the bad guy, I got to run home to change, and I laughed my ass off for a little while.",

        "text": "Cop here. Anyone want a story?\n\nAbout 9 years ago we get a call from a payphone: \"Theres a dead body in the abandoned building at corner 1st and Main (street names made up for this story).\" An officer responds to the area and cant fond anything that would be considered an abandoned building. The caller hung up without leaving any information. And the payphone that he called from was several miles from that area.  So the officer clears out the call having no contact.\n\nThe next day we get another phone call from another payphone. \"There's a dead body inside the abandoned building at the corner of 1st and Main.\" Again they hang up without offering any other information. This time I get dispatched the report. I head up to the area of that intersection and start looking around. Now understand that I live and work in a fairly sizable metropolitan area and this was when the economy was still good. Booming even. Abandoned buildings were hard to come by at that time. I drive through all the shopping plaza is a little industrial complexes within the vicinity of that intersection and I can't come up with anything.\n\nSo I start driving a little bit further in each direction. But I remember that there's some new construction that hasn't been finished yet. And I wonder if they think that those are considered abandoned. I get out of my car and walk through a bunch of businesses that are still in the framing stages. But I can't find anything. As I leave the area I'm now more than a mile from the original call location. As I pull out onto the major roadway I stop for traffic and look in front of me.\n\nThere it is. A gigantic electrical component factory that has been vacant for probably the last 15 years. It has a 9 foot wall around the entire perimeter and the landscaping is still maintained. So it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb right away. That added to the fact that I'm pretty far away from where the caller said it should be. But then again, it's abandoned. It's definitely abandoned and has been for a very long time. So I call for another unit to back me up and we go check it out.\n\nWe use a drainage pipe to climb up and over the 9 foot wall to get inside the perimeter. We start walking the building checking every single door. When I say this place is big I mean it's fucking huge. It's over 100,000 ft.². It's like an old abandoned Motorola, or Freescale, or Intel type building. It has gigantic coolers on the outside, pipes running all over which way, ductwork running down the sides of the buildings, loading docks, and a basement.\n\nEvery door we come across is locked and secured. We continue walking around looking for anything out of place. As I get about three quarters of the way around the building I pull on a door and it flings open. I called my backup who comes over to me. We knock, announce, and enter the building. As we step into a hallway that leads about 100 yards down with doors on either side, the door we just stepped into closes. And it's black. Pitch black. Like can't see my fucking nose on my face black.\n\nWe start moving through the building, trying to clear each room has the best of the two of us can. But this place is absolutely gigantic and each room is connected to what seems like four other rooms. We stepped into one room and the door closes behind us. It must've been some old clean room or something. It was the weirdest thing because there was no sound. Nothing. I couldn't hear the traffic outside, or the grumble of electricity or air moving. All the sounds that we heard throughout the rest of the building were gone in this one room. When I spoke to my partner our voices didn't even echo.  It must've had some kind of sound canceling insulation or something. But it freaked me the fuck out.\n\nThe floor had random 12 inch holes in it, that led down to a basement that was flooded by over 6 feet of water.  Wire, ceiling panels, and wire jacketing, were hanging from the ceiling. There was broken glass, broken pieces of metal and brick, holes in the drywall, and abandoned equipment all over. I clearly remember thinking to myself that if there ever a time that I would be attacked by skinless zombie dogs, this would be it.\n\nAnd the entire time we are trying to find a dead body. As though this shit wasn't freaky enough I'm actively looking for a dead guy.\n\nWe end up moving through the building clearing it as best we can until we get to what was definitely the industrial part of the building. Gigantic boilers, evaporative coolers, and components that run the building. Oh, and spiders. A shit ton of spiders. \n\nWe stepped into a room and find that it is a dead-end. We've reached the end of the building and we don't have any further to go. The room is about 20 x 30', and contains five very large electrical cabinets. They are about 8 feet tall, and each about 4 feet wide, sitting next to each other. And they look exactly how I would design the lab of an evil genius if I had to make a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe entire thing was covered in dials, levers, and red and green buttons. But only the panel in the middle was still illuminated. It had one study glowing red light on it. The first and only light I saw in that entire building.\n\nMy partner calls out to me \"You got anything?\"  I replied \"No. Nothing in here. Looks like this was a gigantic waste of time. Just let me take a look behind these cabinets and will be good to head back to our cars.\" The panels have about 18 to 24 inches of room on each and between them and the wall and the wall behind them. I walk over to the left side and peek my head around....\n\nAnd bam, there he is. A fucking dead guy on the ground, pinned between the wall and the cabinet. He's on his back, arms in front of his chest like a T-Rex, and he has some injuries. And I nearly shot him. Not gonna lie. He scared the living shit out of me. Even though I spent the last hour actively looking for him, I still wasn't completely ready for it. \n\nSo skip ahead to calling detectives etc... \nAt the time, stripping copper was fairly new, at least to our area. I didn't recognize what the wire jacketing meant, as I hadnt seen it before. These two knuckleheads in breaking into this abandoned factory for God knows how long and systematically stripping every piece of metal out of it. And they made it all the way to the very last room. The only room that still have power running to it.\n\nSee, the middle panel, you controlled the fire suppression system for the building. And the owners insurance policy required that it remained on active. When these guys opened up the panels they must've thought they hit the mother load. Each one contained an inch and a half copper cable. Now an inch and a half copper cable is worth quite a bit of money, but it also conducts quite a bit of electricity. They cut through the first one successfully, the leaving the sharp ends exposed inside the cabinet. But when this poor sap started cutting into the second one he got the right of his lifetime. Not only did he electrocute himself, but the current coursing through his arms pulled him into the cabinet stabbing one of the exposed ends of the previous cable into his chest. This kills the copper thief. \n",
