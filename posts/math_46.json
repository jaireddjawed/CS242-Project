The title might be unclear, so let me explain a bit:\n\nI'd like to teach myself some maths, along some of my pals –this is, we'd be learning by ourseleves, as a group, with no teacher.\n\nDo you think it's possible? I'd like to try it because it might help to stay commited and motivated, 'cause there are more people involved and such.\n\nHowever, I can't think of many ways to go; the easiest thing to do would be just reading the books and discuss about them at the end of each chapter or session (we'd schedule the topics or something), but I feel there must be another way.\n\nHave you ever done something similar? Do yoy have any advice? I'll gladly read your thoughts!  :)\n\nFor more context, my pals and I are engineers and maths aficionados. The plan is to learn discrete maths —and who knows, maybe we end up venturing into analysis or something else if we succeed!\n\nP.S.: Sorry if I'm a bit unclear. English is not my native language and I'm overall bad at writing down my thoughts.",

I’ve already graduated from college at a masters level, but my current job doesn’t require much math outside of basic arithmetic and I don’t want to lose my knowledge of math up to and including calculus at the very least.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for practice books or websites that have practice problems that I can solve at my own leisure?

Where is the barrier that separates the tendency to infinity from the non-tendency to infinity? Would an infinity of possibilities give rise to mere unpredictability or to something else?\n\nThank you very much for your opinion.

        "text": "So water has this really cool thing it does where you can measure the volume of practically anything by dipping the object in water and measuring the difference in water level. 1 mL increased gives you a volume of 1cm^(3). \n\nNow it is a bit impractical, but possible to use this concept to measure the area of something. Lets say I want to measure the area under a curve, I could (although inaccurate) cut out a piece of any airtight solid in the shape of that curve and dip it in the water. Then I would divide the volume I calculate by the thickness of that shape to find the area.\n\nNow this does only work if no water seeps into the solid and if it is just a 2d shape extended into the third dimension, but it does work. The only real margin for error is in how accurately that object represents said curve, and parallax error.\n\nObviously modern computers can easily compute the area of this curve in no time, compared to the inaccurate mess that it is to dip it into water, but that's not the point. Any 2 dimensional object's surface area could be measured with elementary math and practically any liquid (water is just convenient).\n\nAnd this works for any 2d shape, not just curves. A toddler could randomly cut paper and make the most atrocious shape you have seen and this area would be calculated with (relative) ease. Just tracing it onto a 3d shape and applying this method would work. Whereas someone doing this mathematically would have to take a different approach. From what I've seen, it too relies on approximation.\n\nNow I've only thought of a few scenarios where doing this is faster than using a computer but these scenarios are extremely idealistic. This method is only advantageous when it comes to random, haphazard shapes. I mean, the time it would take to accurately replicate a curve would be longer than a computer would take to just simulate the entire dipping in water part and it still wouldn't be nearly as accurate as maths. But in some very extreme cases, it looks to me that doing this (or some application of a similar concept) would actually be useful.\n\nNow I'm just stuck on what to do with this idea. I've tried it out on simple shapes and curves already and it works just fine if a little inaccurate. Maybe the math community has some potential for this to be used?",

I either see some pure math subjects like measure theory that go on and on with proof-theorem sequences with no break, or some engineering books who give not much heed to the beauty of the math itself and the need to prove some things. There are study materials that combine the two, but they are rarer than the most that divide between pure maths and applied. I find it very sad, as historically and I think intuitively mathematics is both a notion of the space around us and the natural ability of the human brain to perceive quantity and ideas about measurement and change, and also since antiquity a practical tool that was used to build structures, analyse things objectively and reason correctly.\n\nI think the divide is harming the intellectual pursuit, and I'd like at least myself to be able to pick and study both together!

An infinite number of steps are then performed, such that at each step 10 balls are added to the vase and 1 ball removed from it. The question is then posed: How many balls are in the vase when the task is finished?  \nTo complete an infinite number of steps, it is assumed that the vase is empty at one minute before noon, and that the following steps are performed:  \n- The first step is performed at 30 seconds before noon.  \n- The second step is performed at 15 seconds before noon.\n- Each subsequent step is performed in half the time of the previous step, i.e., step n is performed at 2^−n minutes before noon.\n\n(Assuming the balls are randomly chosen to be removed:)\n\nAt each step n, we have 9*n balls remaining so as n→infinity, the number of balls in the vase should be infinity.\n\nBut probabilistically, the probability that any particular ball remained in the vase at noon was 0 and therefore, by using Boole's inequality and taking a countable sum over the balls, that the probability the vase would be empty at noon was 1.\n\nFrom another perspective:\n\nIf as you put them in, the balls were numbered, and that at step 1 balls 1 through 10 are inserted into the vase, and ball number 1 is then removed. At step 2, balls 11 through 20 are inserted, and ball 2 is then removed.\n\nAt any step the set of balls in in the vase is {1,2,...10n} \\\\ {1,2,...n} \n\nAt noon, the set of balls in the vase is empty. \n\nHowever, if instead on set n you take out ball 10n, the set of balls in in the vase at any step is {1,2,...10n} \\\\ {10,20,...10n}\n\nAt noon, the set of balls in the vase is infinite. \n\nWhy do we get conflicting answers both ways?",
