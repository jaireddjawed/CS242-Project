        "text": "I'm currently doing research for a book, and I've been scouring Wikipedia as well as a few studies. I've come across many sources that say that the Middle Paleolithic saw the first human society ever, with the formation of bands (I call this genre \"Old Rock\").\n\nAs a bit of background, bands are defined as a loosely organized egalitarian group of almost 50 (and sometimes above that) people who are usually linked together by familial relationships. The next step up from bands in complexity is tribes, which are larger, normally incorporate more families, have a \"big man\" or at least a slightly more stratified society, and are more resistant to dissolution.\n\nApparently, in the Lower Paleolithic, before the formation of band societies, humans lived in \"hierarchical groups.\" I'm not too sure what this means - I'd assume it means something like today's wolf packs, with a family of wolves being lead by the \"alpha\" (misnomer for the father of the pack rather than just the strongest wolf, etc). However, this pre-band society would be stratified unlike bands, so wouldn't that make it more complex? Or is the distinction based on size (so did pre-band humans live in kinda patriarchal but small family units instead of egalitarian, larger societies?)?",

I know lizards/giraffes is a bit of a stretch but at least with lions and certainly smaller carnivores like cheetahs etc I can't imagine at the beginning when dogs were wolves and incredibly unfriendly that it would be that much different to handle them. So i guess what I'm asking is why we don't see domesticated versions of other animals with (arguably) advantages over dogs. Such as size, speed or natural defenses (I'm thinking about domesticated komodo dragons again)\n\nTl/dr - Domestication, what makes dogs so special? Why not komodo dragons or chimps or lions?\n\nEdit - thanks for the great replies guys. Common consensus seems to be that it was accidental and we didn't choose dogs, dogs chose us. Interesting to know.\n\nEdit 2 - I've realised I never made a pun on \"man's best friend\" at any point and I'm appropriately disappointed in myself.",

My understanding is that it'd be somewhat weird for a bunch of bridesmaids to wait for and be alone with a man at that time, on account of how limited contact between men and women was, but am I wrong?\n\nFurthermore, I've also read that the Western concept of bridesmaids is *somewhat* foreign to historical Jewish weddings. Maybe one of you guys can verify or dispute that.\n\n(x-post from /r/askhistorians)",

Suffice to say these justifications differ markedly from those used by most cultures to justify torture:\n\n1. Obtaining information;\n\n2. Vengeance and  persecution;\n\n3. Deterrence, both individual and general; and \n\n4. Ideological and religious renunciation  (as by Pol Pot regime, Spanish Inquisition)\n\nAll these justifications have military, criminal justice, or political contexts.  Seems to be little reason to involve children.  Indeed it seems fair to suspect that only the most psychopathic or demented torturer would involve a child as a co-torturer in the above circumstances.\n\n*Editorial comment:*  The intent here is not to justify a disparagement of native American culture *(pre European consolidation of the Americas).* One notes the author’s sympathetic perspective:  “Torture represented an intricate cultural exchange between rivals that went beyond the battlefield and allowed the entire community to express its mourning, its religious beliefs, as well as its collective anger.”  (p. 220)  \n\nNonetheless, it seems fair to place this phenomenon near the top of the list of reprehensible cultural practices throughout history.",

Kinda like when the Native Americans finally was able to claim kinship to the Kennewick man or how Aboriginals in Australia can claim 'kinship' to areas of land now claimed by the whites. But also the other way around, say if a hardcore white supremicist (spelling?) finds out he's part african. \n\nI hope it makes sense. ",

I realize the Tasmanians were wiped out by the mid-19th century but what sources of information are there about this? More in the realm of physical anthropology I'm also a bit curious why Tasmanian Aborigines were so dark skinned considering the climate. ",

For example, that the Titans being overthrown by the Olympians is sort of symbolic of the Indoeuropean religion of the peoples that would become the Classic Greeks replacing the gods that were worshipped before. \nAnother example is that Artemis is supposedly one of the deities that are \"older\" and were present before the Indoeuropean arrival - but I'm not even sure if \"Indoeuropeans arrive in Greece during/after the Dark Ages, replacing the previous cultures and giving rise to what we think of as Ancient Greek culture\" is even still assumed to be what happened? \n\nAnd any time I try to get deeper into the subject what I find is reliant on Arthur Evans' ideas about Minoan culture and religion, which as far as I know have been pretty much discredited - there's vague ideas about mother goddesses and chthonic deities but so much of it sounds very speculative. So, what do we know about Minoan and other Aegean deities? Did they leave their traces in later myth?",

I know there are a lot of similarities in terms of beliefs, moral codes, practices, rituals, etc across varying religions of varying time periods. But as for actual fundamental differences, I'm looking for answers relating to the different religions' conceptions of god, their attitudes towards sin, punishment, repentance, moderation, etc.\n\n.... Because in both medieval and modern societies (medieval especially), religion has been a fantastic tool in ensuring obedience by instilling a fear in people regarding the afterlife, etc. Of course it hasn't only just served this function, but I believe it to be one of the most prominent functions of religion. \n\nBut this question is probably way too broad, since pre-class societies would've also had systems of governance which they were trying to maintain and enforce... so... any answer related to some of this would be appreciated.

They also traveled through Indonesia and Asia, where their genetic legacy shows up. \n\nRegarding their genetics, it appears that they [evolved at high altitudes](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/tibetans-inherited-high-altitude-gene-ancient-human).\n\nTo the extent of my knowledge on the subject, the only hominid fossils (matching this data) that didn't neatly fit into any species were the Meganthropus remains (which are largely regarded as a splinter group of Homo erectus).\n\nBased on comparisons between the different Meganthropus fossils ([such as Meganthropus A/Sangiran 6](https://rephaim23.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/meganthropus-gigantopithecus.jpg)), Meganthropus had a [similar tooth size as the Denisovans](https://taobabe.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/denisovanhumantooth.jpg?w=640). Could they be from the same species?\n\nMore or less, I think we can assume that height somewhat scales with jaw size for hominids. It isn't a rule, but in general creatures with larger teeth have larger jaws. And with larger jaws come larger bodies to accommodate those features. Paranthropus boisei, though, provides an exception to this rule.\n\n**So how possible is it that the Denisovans are actually Meganthropus?**",
