For my final research project I have been really interested in making a digital handheld pet game, like a tamagotchi, for children aged 9-11 who suffer from ADHD. I grew up playing with tamagotchis and when I recently bought a new one it took me a while to understand how it works. Reading the overcomplicated instructions manual led me to think about how children with cognitive disabilities understand tamagotchis, which led me to focus on ADHD specifically. \n\nTamagotchi features include, feeding, discipline, health monitoring, evolution, death - So what I'm asking is do you think tamagotchis are overcomplicated?\n\nIf I was to make a tamagotchi, what features are good to include that may interest a child with ADHD?example: Less options on menu bar, or should include feeding, sleeping and a game (entertainment).\n\nLet me know! would appreciate all your help\n\nDisclaimer: I do not have ADHD myself",

        "text": "Please excuse the terrible title, I feel like I don't even know what I'm trying to do and just want to get words out of my head and onto something else.\n\nBit of background first... I (32M) went to see my GP expressing concerns about ADHD after finding a psychological report that was made when I was 7yo, followed by my own research into symptoms vs my own life experience. His stance was that while he didn't specialise in psychology, he didn't think I had ADHD but would refer me to community mental health clinic*.\n\nI had my appointment with the clinic, and brought up ADHD. I was given some questionnaires (ASRS and WURS I think?) to fill out in my own time. \n\nReturned the questionnaires at my next regularly scheduled appointment (could've done it sooner, but organising it seemed like a lot of hassle, so I didn't). The doctor at the clinic said he'd submit the questionnaires for referral to the specialist team in my region.\n\nA little over 3 months later, regularly scheduled appointment at the clinic, the doctor asked if I had received any acknowledgement, which I hadn't - I didn't really think any more of it because I wasn't aware I should expect acknowledgement and I think have been significant backlogs for ADHD assessments etc so it's probably just in the pipeline somewhere.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I had my most recent regular appointment. I asked if there was any update on the referral and was told I did not meet the criteria for ADHD, and that the report I had was more in line with ASD. I didn't ask any more related questions at the time, I think all the questions I had came to mind after I had left the clinic.\n\nNow,where I am right now, I'm just stumped as to what to do. With the system as I understand it here (in Ireland), it goes GP -&gt; community mental health -&gt; specialist team (based on your region) so I feel as though attempting to get a second opinion will wind up in the same place.\n\nI've been questioning myself this whole damn time - am I just trying to convince myself I have ADHD, do I just suck at life and need to get better, etc etc. I just want to know why I am the way I am, and ADHD has felt the most on-point (from my own research and sharing experiences with people who have been diagnosed), but self diagnosing is nothing more than a suspicion so I'm not much closer to understanding my problems üòî\n\nIt just feels like after 10ish years of being treated for depression and anxiety (with a 2 year period in the middle of that where I did well off medication), I thought I had another piece of the puzzle and that maybe ADHD may be partly responsible for the depression and anxiety, but it feels more like \"WRONG! Try again, idiot\" \n\n*I can't remember if he referred me, or if I told them I had already been attending the clinic, or both",

        "text": " \n\nHello r/ADHD community,\n\nSelf-diagnosis is a common occurrence, especially for those who may not have access to healthcare or may feel uncomfortable seeking medical attention. While it's important to stress the importance of seeking a proper diagnosis from a medical professional, it's also crucial to understand why someone may choose to self-diagnose.\n\nFirst, not everyone has access to healthcare. Many people may not have the resources or financial means to seek medical attention. In such cases, self-diagnosis may be the only option.\n\nSecond, some individuals may feel uncomfortable seeking medical attention due to stigmas surrounding mental health or a lack of trust in the healthcare system. In such cases, self-diagnosis may be a way for them to understand their symptoms and seek support.\n\nThird, self-diagnosis can be a starting point for someone to begin exploring their mental health and seeking appropriate care. Many people who self-diagnose do eventually seek professional help once they understand their symptoms.\n\nIt's important to remember that self-diagnosis is not a substitute for proper medical evaluation and treatment. However, it's also crucial to understand that many people may not have the resources or may face barriers that prevent them from seeking medical attention.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important not to be frustrated with those who self-diagnose and instead focus on promoting accurate and responsible diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. We can work together as a community to raise awareness about the importance of seeking proper medical attention and provide resources and support to those who may face barriers in accessing healthcare.",

Yeah, I struggled, but overall, I did well. So when I got back on my meds, I didn't feel a big change. They were helping, but not as much as I remembered. That was until I played God of War ragnarok. I got the game right before getting back on my meds, and while I had beat it, I struggled with the more difficult bosses in the game. Like the final ghost warrior and that end-game valkyrie. And by struggling, I mean I spent dozens of attempts hours of frustration and ended up finally giving up and only barely managed by switching to easy mode. I recently replayed the game, and when I got to these bosses, I was very anxious. I beat both in 2 attempts. First try, I memorized their attacks, and second try, I beat them. I was fucking blown away. \n\nSo I decided to go and finally try blood borne again. I never got close to beating it. This time, I beat it and never even struggled. I can't believe how fucking good I did. The hardest bosses in the game got fucking wrecked by me in 1 or 2 attempts. I couldn't beat the first boss before. Then, when I finally tried the game again, I couldn't get past the second boss. Now im gonna re-visit returnal and get the darksoul games. I feel so confident in my abilities now, like I could beat any game. I had no idea how much my adhd was holding me back. I just thought I wasn't very good at games or wasn't as good as I remembered being.",

Basically, nothing ever relates to me. For example, a teacher says what a great class we are, and I think ‚Äúaww true this is a really great class... but like the others not me‚Äù. And I don't mean that I'M NOT GREAT, but I am just not really part of the group... despite being part of it. Or eg. when a YouTuber says \"I want to thank every single one of my subscribers‚Äù... like do you feel addressed by them..., because I definitely don't. \n\nBut also other situations where I should know like basic information about myself. Eg. if I prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream. Literally, EVERY TIME I'm like.. I cant remember. Until like a year ago, where I had to sit myself consciously down and tell myself so I don't forget: YOU PREFER CHOCOLATE, now please don't forget it lol. OR even though I am literally a college student or like work in a caf√© I don't FEEL like a student or a barista... Like when people talk about like making coffee and being a barista I don't think it includes me EVEN THOUGH IT LITERALLY DOES?!\n\nI don't know if this makes any sense but since I'm currently evaluating my entire life I thought hey I would finally ask if that's ... normal?!\n\nYeah would love to hear you thoughts on this :))))",

        "text": " \n\nNo idea if this is allowed so please delete it if it isn't.  \n\nOne of my main issues with my ADHD is food. Too much, too little, can't cook, can't shop because I get overwhelmed, can't decide what to eat, blah blah blah. This is why I am overweight and I really struggle with it. \n\nI had a leaflet through the post about Hello Fresh and there was a discount code which meant that the first box was only ¬£14, so I spoke to my partner and we thought we might as well try it for that.   \n\nOh. My. God.  \n\nWhat an absolute game-changer.   \n\nHonestly, I don't think I will ever not use it now.   \n\nEvery weeknight we have a home-cooked meal because it is my newest hyperfocus, but it has been about 2 months now and it's actually becoming routine.  \n\nSo it is simple, you choose the meals you want weeks in advance on the app (which helps because I can plan weeks in advance in one sitting!). Then the box gets delivered every Friday, and everything is in it that you need, so now I don't have to spend ages shopping trying to figure out what I need and what meals we are going to have.  \n\nThen they are so easy to cook, with step-by-step instructions that come printed on a card, so I can keep it up when I am cooking because I have to check the instructions 278463278 times!   \n\nPlus it has a calorie count which means that we aren't just eating crap.   \n\nI have already lost weight, I actually enjoy the meals and cooking and there is very little cleanup and no waste.  \n\nSo I thought I would share my experience with it and say that it has honestly changed my little ADHD life!   \n\nNow I do have a referral code, so if you want to use it, it gets you money off your first box, and it does give me money off mine, so I don't know if I am allowed to post it or not but I will. You don't have to use it, but it is the same money off that I got to start us on that first box.   \n\nI honestly hate myself for not doing this earlier!   The meals are a perfect size, you can choose how many you want each week and you can pause/skip the boxes too.\n\nhttps://www.hellofresh.co.uk/pages/raf\\_lp11?c=HS-AWMUKZW8D&amp;utm\\_campaign=clipboard&amp;utm\\_couponvalue=42&amp;utm\\_invitername=Jenna&amp;utm\\_medium=referral&amp;utm\\_source=raf-share",

        "text": "**TLDR;** I've really struggled with completing my master's thesis for years (began grad program in 2017, \"graduated\" in 2019). I didn't know I had ADHD until a few years into the struggle, then things made sense. I just had a major breakthrough and I was working on it almost daily, but I recently lost progress from my recent files spontaneously corrupting, and I didn't have recent backups (I at least had a good copy, but recent progress is gone). Now I'm struggling to work on it again despite almost being done. Idk what to do.\n\n**Background:** Lots of major life stuff was happening when I \"graduated\" the master's program that led to overall burnout, but after finding out about ADHD, my lack of dedication boiled down to 1) completion wasn't required at the time I finished my classes (no deadline anxiety) 2) course load was enough to prevent me from doing my thesis before graduation 3) after classes were over, I had no structure to keep me in check, and 4) I was disheartened each time I submitted for comments because something was always wrong with it. At one point, I might've worked on it once a month, but that kind of improved after time passed and I started proper meds.\n\n**Good news:** FINALLY in October 2022...my thesis chair approved my thesis to be reviewed by the rest of my committee! I sent them my chair-approved draft and waited. One quickly gave approval, but the other didn't give me comments until the end of January. Despite critiques, this committee member said she was willing to move forward with my defense if my chair thinks I'm ready. Thing is, you can pass your defense and still be required to fix issues afterwards (at least in my program). Once I do the defense, I want it to be done, so I said, \"If it's okay, I'd rather fix these issues before I defend.\" I closed my email and didn't check again for 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n**More good news:** Since I had a real break from it, my motivation improved significantly and I worked on it almost daily. My fresh eyes noticed new mistakes, and I attended trainings for work that actually related to my thesis content...even had my thesis open to take notes. I thought I made some okay progress, but I hadn't changed anything major (thankfully).\n\n**MAJOR BAD NEWS:** I saved a new file every time I worked on my thesis just in case I deleted something important, and everything was on this thumb drive that was always reliable...until it wasn't. Dialogue box came up and said something was wrong with my drive, and it needed to be repaired to avoid data loss. It \"fixed\" it, but EVERY THESIS FILE SINCE 2019 WAS GONE. When I try to open the files, it just shows random symbols and won't even open on word. It ONLY affected certain folders, and OF COURSE it had to be my thesis stuff. BUT, there is some hope: I at least recovered the chair-approved version from emails.\n\n**Conundrum:** When checking the email to retrieve the document, the committee member had later said NOT to make changes until I asked my chair if it was okay, so I basically wasted a month of my time trying to work on it anyway, although the stuff I added/fixed would've been nice to have. Chair says to make the changes and is excited that I'm almost done, but I've lost pretty much all motivation to work on it. The grammar stuff I fixed is gone, the info I learned from trainings isn't fresh in my brain like it was, and some literature I added is gone. I feel stuck again and I can't seem to get out of it. Any advice is appreciated.",

        "text": "I (19F) finally got my ADHD diagnosis last year in july. There was sort of an introductory meeting before the real assessment where I had to answer a bunch of questions to rule out other things. I filled out a questionnaire on depression and when I handed it back to the specialist he said ‚ÄúWell, you seem depressed‚Äù. And it was never mentioned again, only in the epicrisis/final evaluation (a document that was sent to me) where it said my diagnosis and why I got it and everything. I don‚Äôt know how it works in other countries but I live in a Scandinavian country if that matters. \n\nAnyways, I had been thinking about if I had a depression but then the epicrisis said that they chose to dismiss it because I probably had symptoms of depression (and a few of anxiety) because of the complications of my ADHD. It has to be said that I ‚Äúscored‚Äù pretty high when i checked off the symptoms I experience of depression. So I was, to say the least, kind of surprised that they did not go more into that. Especially when it is a known fact that ADHD is often comorbid with other mental illnesses such as depression and/or anxiety etc. And generally girls are diagnosed later than boys so they are more prone to develop a secondary disorder because they have a hard time with for example school and friends and they don‚Äôt know why. At least that is kinda what happened to me I think. \n\nI guess I just wanted to hear if I should talk to them about it or maybe another professional and get a second opinion or if I should just take their word that there is nothing to worry about. Honestly writing this the answer almost seems obvious but I think I need reassurance that I am not wrong to think that they should have gone more into that after knowing my symptoms.

        "text": "So, went into my typical provider and she had this new medication that she was thinking about putting me on. It's this new drug from 2021 which is Azstarys. I didn't know a lot about it but I trust her wit my life. She even had a nice co-pay card that had it down to 0$ for month 1, 50$ for every other month. I started on the middle dose...meh. Fine, but not great. This month we bumped up to the highest dose and by god it is the best medicine I have ever taken for the ADHD I have.\n\nBackground. I am 5'11, 220 lbs. Big boy. Crippling adhd lol. Diagnosed since I was 14. 2004. Back then it was adderall only, but then in 2007 I started taking Vyvanse when it first came out. Great drug. Took it for a few years then I had parents that at the time didn't quite understand adhd and thought I was getting good grades in college so I was not needing to take the meds anymore. I stopped from the age of 21 to...30. Made it through undergrad, grad, and even through law school before I realized I was drowning and needed to get back on the meds. It was when I failed the Bar exam, anyways got back on it. Been great since, except my current job has terrible health insurance and Vyvanse was gonna be 400$ a month. So, we played around with stuff until I found this drug.\n\nBasically here's what I feel like on this drug. It lasts longer than anything except vyvanse. It's potent I can't lie. It keeps me super super focused. Basically this appears to have the instant release of adderall combined with the long term potential of Vyvanse in one easy package. It lasts between 12-14 hours for me. Premium drug. If you can get it, get it. That's my two cents.",

The doctor was confused by how stimulants help people with ADHD. Anyway so he continued by saying in his opinion those with \"these conditions\" won't have a long lived career in this sector. I'm going to be working offshore as a junior geologist for some context. \n\nI think he did raise a good point in a way. If anything gets in the way of you concentrating in critical high risk environment then it could be dangerous. Since I had the medical I've started my survival as I have a temporary medical. I've been thinking whether or not I need the meds. I've been getting alot better and my ADHD doesn't seem to be as much of an issue for me. Although I still think about my job history and my difficulty with it i.e. in most jobs I've only done for 5 or 6 months and I've failed two job probations. Also one other thing to consider is that I've had a physical injury which has made my mood alot lower. However as of late it's gotten alot better. \n\nI have my follow up with the ADHD specialist in April. Part of me wants them to sign me off in a way I don't need medication offshore. Acting calm in the appointment, maintaining eye contact and not being hyper haha. Another part of me wonders if it's something that could help me. I have dealt with difficulties with organisation and concentration and emotional regulation because of my ADHD and it's stopped me being responsible for myself and I've been completely helpless in jobs. However maybe that's because I just didn't have the right support in place.\n\nAny thoughts?",

I‚Äôm over the moon excited but now the fear that I‚Äôm going to be a bad father is setting in. \n\nWe talked with my psychiatrist before we even started trying and she is supportive and thinks I can handle it. I‚Äôve got a great support system, my wife is going to be a stay at home mom, and I‚Äôve had nearly two decades to develop coping skills. Still, I‚Äôm doubting myself. Since we got that positive test, I‚Äôve become hyper aware of how much my ADHD is impacting my daily life. It actually seems to have gotten worse lately, possibly due to long covid. \n\nMy wife frequently has to remind me to do things. It‚Äôs especially bad with the things that just recently became my responsibility like scooping cat litter and any cleaning that requires strong chemicals. It‚Äôs been 3 months and I still haven‚Äôt been able to get them locked down into my routine. What if my wife starts to resent me for always having to make sure I do what I need to do? What if I forget something for the baby and she‚Äôs not there to remind me? I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll be one of those parents who kills their baby by forgetting them in the car or the bath. \n\nI get easily overstimulated and loud noises are my biggest issue. Babies cry.  I‚Äôve been able to handle it when babysitting other peoples kids, but I know that‚Äôs different than all day every day. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll just shut down and not be able to take care of whatever is making the baby cry.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience with being a parent?

Long story short about a year ago my sister (38) said something along the lines of \"I've just finished a process where I've been assessed for autism and ADHD and I've been diagnosed with autism and I think you need to be assessed for both too\".  I mentioned this to my husband and child and we filed it away for consideration (mental health provision in the UK is shit and the process looks neverending, and at the time it didn't feel like a priority). \n\nNaturally I began doing some research into both and then my stupidly overly-helpful phone picked up on my research and now every single link/video etc on FB is ADHD related. A lot of it is relatable so I started researching professional diagnosis, and think I'm going to go private and pay somebody just to get a clear yes/no then I can stop obsessing. My daughter is convinced I have it, based on tiktok as far as I can tell (!).\n\nMy slight concern is that as far as I understand it the diagnosis is questionnaire-interview based. I have a stupid brain - I over-research and convince myself of everything. For example, I had a ridiculously stressful period a few years ago (horrendous) and had some physical symptoms from that and convinced myself I had both MS and rheumatoid arthritis in quick succession. Got checked out, negative for both (had very real symptoms but fortunately nothing serious and all stress-related).\n\nI'm concerned I'm going to do the same with ADHD. Pick up on the things I do that reinforce I have it and ignore everything else (confirmation bias?). Do you guys think the diagnostic process is rigorous enough that even if my over-analysing stupid brain tries to convince them I have ADHD when I don't they'll pick up on it? I obviously don't want a diagnosis of something I don't have, and it also feels like an insult to those who genuinely have it if I'm walking around with a diagnosis of it when I don't.\n\nHope this makes sense.

        "text": "Hi, I go by \"Toad\" on the internet. 27M. I feel like my symptoms and signs of ADHD went unnoticed as a child and I now just deal with it on a regular basis. I was always well behaved in class and growing up in the early 2000's the only \"ADHD\" kids where the ones bouncing off the walls or misbehaving. I spent almost 3/4 of my time in school watching other kids and being almost completely unsociable. \nI spent most days reading as many books as I could. One sign of dysfunction I never realized was daydreaming. I did an ingodly amount of it. I had an obsession with living in my own head and prefered I be left alone while doing so. I was always hyperfocused on the lives of creatures and people in my own world. \nThe books only fueled that daydreaming. I would miss half or more of what the teachers where teaching and afterwards I would re-read sections of books as fast as possible at home to catch up. But I fell behind quite a bit. My parents couldnt understand why my grades fell so harshly in the second half of K12. From 6th grade onward I was always doing the bare minimum.\nFrom my school years to graduating with the bare minimum grades to dropping out of college. My lack of being able to focus on the task at hand has caused me a lot of heartache. I failed in a lot of areas but I continued to work on myself. \nMy relationship with my wife is amazing. I do feel like i dissapoint her with inability to do basic chores. She herself is a diagnosed schizophrenic so she doesnt give me too much stress about it but it does have its breaking point.\nAmongs other things I experience things like ADHD \"paralysis\" and I also almost always need things repeated to me many times before I truly understand what was said. \nOverall I want help but Ive never went out and done it because im afraid of being medicated. I took an adderall about a year ago for the first time and I internally almost broke down from the relief. It calmed the fire inside my head that rages constantly. Im just afraid of addiction and the dependency.",

        "text": "**Content warning: emotional abuse, suicidal ideation, depression.**\n\n**Spoiler: happy ending. **\n\nThis is a story of a dark road. Maybe you aren't ready for that today. That's ok. \n\nBecause I was a very unpleasant person for a while, and I can't even say that I didn't mean it. Maybe by the end of this you won't think I deserve the happy ending I got. I am still not convinced myself.\n\nStill here? Then I will begin.\n\nWhat no one who hasn't experienced it directly doesn't realise about depression is just how rational it is. How cold and unemotional it makes you.\n\nAnd how easy to be cruel. \n\nIn some ways it's a survival mechanism. Lock down the problem and keep on fighting, to process later. But what when there isn't 'later'? \n\nWell, that's living with undiagnosed ADHD. You're always fighting. You're struggling. You're failing and you don't know why. And you can't stop - you have to keep on fighting.\n\nThat brings small pieces of depression with it, and those build up if you don't stop to process. \n\nThat's what happened to me. I've been low key depressed for a long time. 20 years or more probably. It was a bit of a seasonal 'slump' most years, and just generally feeling 'a bit down' overall. \n\nI don't know exactly what tipped the balance last year. It might have been a combination of things. COVID not least. \n\nBut it stopped being 'low key' depression, and I started being a really very toxic person indeed. I'd always had some negativity going on, but knew enough to keep that buttoned down, because I know how hurtful 'cruel truth' can be. \n\nBut something _did_ tip the balance. It pushed me to a point of suicidal ideation.\n\nAnd if you've never experienced it, let me tell you this - I was coldly rational about. It wasn't my being impulsive. It was the seemingly natural conclusion to the downward spiral of my life. Of just finally 'giving up' and letting myself rest. \n\nI wasn't in a place where friends posting 'I'm here for you' or whatever could reach me. I just couldn't believe anyone actually wanted me in their life, and behind all those smiles I saw ... well, just people kinda tolerating my existence. \n\nI didn't _want_ them to help me. I didn't want anyone to even notice, as I slowly removed myself from their lives. \n\nSo outwardly? I'm sure it'd have been unexpected. Superficially I look like I'm doing ok. I've got a job, it pays well, I've a partner and a dog, and somewhere to live. \n\n... but my heart was dead none the less, and it was only a matter of time before the rest of me followed.\n\nADHD and Depression were taking turns to kick me in the executive function, and steadily I was spiralling down. \n\nAnd this is why I became a toxic person. Probably crossing the line of being an emotional abuser. It's hit my like a brick just today, that ... well, I _knew_ I was being awful, and I've love to day I didn't mean it. \n\n... but I did mean it. I was _trying_ to push my partner away. To encourage her to leave, and not feel bad when I 'disappeared'. \n\nAnd in all honesty? Red flags everywhere. She'd have been _right_ to leave me. \n\nThat's a difficult sort of realisation. No one really believes they're the 'bad guy' in their personal narrative. But I was.\n\nADHD - and depression - were my reason. Not my excuse. I have no excuse for this. Not really. Maybe a slight offering of _trying_ to be cruel to be kind? But that's always been a bit of a feeble rationalisation, and it is here too. \n\nBut it was part of my preparing for suicide. Working through my very rational seeming list. I'd arranged life insurance, and may sure my inheritance was 'in order'. I wanted my partner to be looked after after I'd gone. So I'd made sure my 'paperwork' was in order generally, and would be easy to sort. \n\nThe last piece of the 'puzzle' though? My dog. I just couldn't figure out how she'd be able to understand and move on. Because I knew she wouldn't. She sits for me by the door waiting for me to come home from work, and I just couldn't figure out how she'd move on when I never did. \n\nSo I kept coming home, still with no hope left, but waiting and seeing if I would solve that last 'piece'. \n\nBut still being a toxic vile person, and miserable to live with.  I could even see myself doing it - it made me feel worse - but I still was trying to pretend it was all for the best. \n\nMy partner ... well, we had a blazing row. I felt emotions for the first time in ages, and they weren't the kind of good and positive emotions. I said a lot of frankly vile, spiteful and somewhat true things. You can always find the most vulnerable spots to lash out at a person you really know well. \n\nAnd she gave me an ultimatum - get it sorted.\n\nDespite all that misery I'd caused her. Despite me being an emotionally abusive asshole, she still had faith that this _wasn't me_. This wasn't the man she loved. \n\nAnd she didn't let me off the hook either - as is so easy with ADHD, things slip out of the brain. It's one of the reasons why ADHD+depression is such a filthy combo, because both resist getting diagnosed and treated for the other. \n\nBut I did. I self referred to a therapist, and started treatment. By far the hardest 'step' of doing that, was that first one - the process of therapy was actually fairly gentle and easy. \n\nIt was a last ditch attempt though - I figured I could always go through with suicide afterwards if it didn't work, so it was worth one last try. \n\nMy depression got dialled back a bit, and it made the ADHD lurking in the shadows a bit more obvious. I got referred for ADHD treatment and diagnosis too. \n\nI almost didn't follow through with that either, until I started digging deeper and figuring out just how far reaching it had been. \n\nI'd honestly been oblivious, but my whole life is ADHD 'signs' everywhere. It's one great big tapestry that says 'this guy has ADHD' - just maybe with a few holes and threadbare patches, as I'd put it together by trial and error, and that's where the depression got in. \n\nGetting diagnosed and treated for ADHD at the start of this year is one of the better life decisions I've made. I genuinely didn't expect anything much - I've been depressed too long for that. \n\nBut ... well, it's been somewhat amazing. Just _knowing_ it was ADHD helped a huge amount with unpacking my negative self worth baggage. My sense of failure, worthlessness and 'what if I am just lazy?' \n\nMedication too is part of the picture? I'm not playing on 'hard mode' any more. It's not exactly easy, but \"less hard\" is good enough for me. \n\nSo today? I'm happier than I can remember. I've been depressed a LONG time, and it feels like that's evaporated entirely. \n\nI have a good life. I have a job that I love, I have a dog, and most of all I have a partner who had faith in me  in the darkness. She's been truly amazing. \n\nI'm not sure I'm a good person yet. But I'm definitely a better person that I was. And I _want_ to be a good person now, and I believe that I _can_ tackle my failures - ADHD or not - and move forward. \n\nBecause my partner has shown me love, faith and compassion when I really didn't deserve it. I can do no less than to try and live up to that.",
