        "text": "Adoption of renewable energy has accelerated in the West in the last few years. Last year an estimated 25% of new energy generation [came from wind](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-more-than-a-quarter-of-2016-capacity-additions-were-wind/448946/), while solar capacity [nearly doubled](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-solar-market-grows-95-in-2016-smashes-records). Spain currently gets [nearly half](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/09/47-spains-electricity-made-renewables-march/) of its electricity from renewables, and a recent French government report [has claimed that](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/14/100-renewable-electricity-2050-possible-france/) France could go 100% non-nuclear renewable by 2050 without significant additional expense. Costs for power from wind and and other renewables have even become [cost-competitive with non-renewables](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/germanys-first-onshore-wind-auction-brings-low-prices-for-citizen-projects) in some European markets.\n\nHowever, plenty of concerns remain. Across much of the US, renewables are [nowhere near](https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2017/04/04/despite-claims-of-grid-parity-wind-and-solar-are-still-more-expensive-than-fossil-fuels/#7787595440e4) cost-competitive with traditional sources of power, especially with a boon in natural gas generation in recent years. Additionally, a [recent trade case](http://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/359443-if-trump-is-looking-out-for-consumers-hell-reject-solar-tariffs) may significantly damage further solar prospects in the US. Meanwhile, major nuclear projects have [stalled](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/climate/nuclear-power-project-canceled-in-south-carolina.html) in the US, questioning the future of nuclear as \"green\" renewable and natural gas prices fall. It has also been pointed out that a transition to renewables would require a [massive overhaul](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/modernizing-us-energy-grid) of the US grid, at significant short term expense. Additionally, a [range of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_wind_power) have been raised about heretofore unforeseen negative environmental effects of various renewables. Finally, there remain concerns about economic transition away from coal and oil to other energy sectors.\n\n---\n\n* How, and how quickly, should the US and other nations transition to renewable energy?\n* What about developing nations? How quickly can or should they transition?\n* What proportion of renewable power should we be aiming for, given current conditions? Is 100% renewable feasible?\n* What policies should be implemented by developed and developing governments to facilitate or ease this transition?",

        "text": "**Background**\n\nThere is presently [a controversy over alterations of reports given to the House of Commons related to Brexit by Brexit minister David Davis.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/mps-attack-david-davis-for-handing-over-redacted-brexit-reports)  That controversy has included suggestions, including contempt of Parliament.  Such allegations [would be made to the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, who would then possibly refer it to a committee for adjudication if he found evidence of contempt.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42149793)\n\nUnder other Westminster systems, a finding of contempt has been the basis of a no-confidence measure against the government.  Notable recently was the 2011 [fall of the Harper government in Canada on issues of contempt similar to those alleged in the UK.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-government-falls-in-historic-commons-showdown/article4181393/)\n\nDavis is not Prime Minister, but under principles of [collective responsibility of the Government to the Commons](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7755) his position could be attributed to the government as a whole.  It has been argued by Ian Brodie in the Canadian context that [individual impeachment has become depricated by collective responsibility and that if a single minister were found to have lost confidence, it would fell the entire government.](https://parliamentum.org/2017/01/04/on-collective-ministerial-responsibility-and-impeachment/)\n\nHowever, in 2011 the UK changed electoral laws with the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011)  This law requires that early dissolution requires either a two-thirds vote for a measure that there should be an early election, or else a simple majority must adopt a resolution \"That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.\"\n\n**Question**\n\nHow would a finding of contempt of Parliament against a government minister fit into that framework, if not accompanied by the requisite finding of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government to trigger the FTPA?",

According to the law that created and defined the CFPB, if the director position is vacant, the acting director takes over until a new permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.  Cordray's deputy thus took over as acting director ... but Trump just named a new acting director.  He claims he has authority to do this under the vacancies act, which lets the president fill vacancies with temporary people until permanent ones are nominated and confirmed.  This doesn't seem to make sense to me, because the law says who the acting director is and thus there's no vacancy there, and the permanent director is a position he can only fill either with Senate confirmation or a recess appointment.  But Trump's office of legal counsel signed off on it and says it's legal.\n\nWhat's the precedent here?  What's the law?  Is what Trump is trying to do, actually legal?\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/11/25/politics/white-house-cfpb-mulvaney/index.html",

At what income level does a family with two children begin to lose money under this plan, what about a family with four children? \n\nI've heard claims that scrapping the SALT tax deductions is a targeted way of forcing people in predominantly blue states to pay more in taxes while it doesn't affect people in republican controlled states as strongly. Is there any truth to that? Which states would be hit the hardest by this and which ones would benefit the most?\n\nIs the quick and dirty explanation of the Alternative Minimum Tax presented in this article accurate? What are the advantages and disadvantages of removing this system? Has the AMT been effective in forcing higher income households to pay their fair share of tax? Why is it that the AMT is apparently [really good](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-pays-amt) at targeting people in the $500,000-$1,000,000 income bracket but affects people above that so much less?\n\nI've been trying to understand what's going on with the republican tax plan at a deeper level than \"tax the poor to give money to the rich\" or \"simplify the tax code and make sure everyone pays less\" which seem to be the two positions that people take on either side of the political spectrum.

        "text": "##**Due to the attention this topic has been getting, the moderators of NeutralPolitics have decided to consolidate discussion of Net Neutrality into one place. Enjoy!**\n\n---\n\nAs of yesterday, 21 November 2017, Ajit Pai, the current head of the Federal Communications Commission, [announced](https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/933009189991079936?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) plans to roll back Net Neutrality regulations on internet service providers (ISPs). The proposal, which an FCC press release [has described](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1121/DOC-347868A1.pdf) as a return to a \"light touch regulatory approach\", will be voted on next month.\n\nThe FCC memo claims that [the current Net Neutrality rules](https://www.cnet.com/news/13-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-fccs-net-neutrality-regulation/), brought into place in 2015, have \"depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation\". Supporters of Net Neutrality [argue](https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now) that the repeal of the rules would allow for ISPs to control what consumers can view online and price discriminate to the detriment of both individuals and businesses, and that investment [may not actually have declined](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/in-anti-net-neutrality-push-fcc-downplays-data-that-contradicts-narrative/) as a result of the rules change.\n\nCritics of the current Net Neutrality regulatory scheme argue that the current rules, which treat ISPs as a utility subject to special rules, is [bad for consumers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/07/07/why-treating-the-internet-as-a-public-utility-is-bad-for-consumers/) and other problems, like the lack of competition, [are more important](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/we-dont-need-net-neutrality-we-need-competition/). \n\n---\n\n**Some questions to consider:**\n\n* How important is Net Neutrality? How has its implementation affected consumers, businesses and ISPs? How would the proposed rule changes affect these groups?\n* What alternative solutions besides \"keep/remove Net Neutrality\" may be worth discussing?\n* Are there any major factors that haven't received sufficient attention in this debate? Any factors that have been overblown?",

All traffic is handled equally.\n\n[Some people, including the FCC itself, claims that the problem is not with Net Neutrality, but Title II](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0427/DOC-344591A1.pdf).  The FCC and [anti-Title II arguments](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436807/net-neutrality-government-control-your-internet-service) seem to talk up Title II as the problem, rather than the concept of \"treating all traffic the same\".\n\nCan I get some neutral view of what Title II is and how it impacts local ISPs?  Is it possible to have net neutrality without Title II, or vice versa?  How would NN look without Title II?  Are there any arguments for or against Title II aside from the net neutrality aspects of it?  Is there a \"better\" approach to NN that doesn't involve Title II?",
