        "text": "Maggie O’Farrell’s “Hamnet”\n\nfinally finished “hamnet”, a book that felt like being held by the person that loves you most in this world. the themes of family, community, remembrance and love made this book feel so tender and gentle. it’s a book that’s not so much about Shakespeare himself — I’m not even sure if his name is mentioned once in the novel — but it’s more about the humanity found within a family facing tragedy. It definitely takes a prominent historical figure in literature and makes him human, both on a small scale in his mannerisms and on a larger scale, translating into his plays. I think that the writing style did get to me every once in a while — a common case of too much telling and not enough showing for me, but it didn’t take away from the strong sense of family and belonging that this book delivers to its readers. I felt like it was on the opposite extreme of the novel “Lincoln in the Bardo”, which did a lot more showing and almost too little telling. Anyone else read this one?",

The nights I did this moved ever so fast.” \n\nI just wrote 10 syllables. Is it automatically iambic pentameter if I, the author, don’t intend it to be read in a stressed, unstressed pattern?",

        "text": "Has anyone read this one? I keep seeing people on Twitter talking about how much they love it, how they with they wrote like this, etc. \n\nI finished it two days ago, and I'm really torn. On the one hand, I didn't enjoy the writing style very much - far too many similes in place of description. And overuse of short sentences. Lots of passive voice, which I find distracting. \n\nStory-wise, I keep thinking about it. Though the two main characters seem on balance pretty one dimensional, some of the other peripheral characters are more complex and start to shine as basically the very moment I stop caring about the two leads. The setting in late 19th century Montreal is unique and compelling. The ties to the French Revolution become more obvious throughout as each character fulfills their destiny. \n\nI guess my feeling right now is that I didn't like this book, but it has made me think and I keep thinking about it. And maybe that is the real point. It seems intended to be a feminist story, but the female leads end up disempowering all the women below them in the service of their own power. The class uprising dies right down again when participants are confronted by the obligations that entrapped them in the first place. The story is smutty rather than erotic, intended to shock and sensationalize rather than reveal deeper levels of the main characters.\n\nBut maybe I am being ungenerous. To the people who are raving about this book, help me see what I am missing!",

Will she be read in 50 years? 100? This friend of mine loves her, thinks she is deep, and thinks I'm too hard on people liking her. I tend to think that reading poetry in general is a good thing––and if Kaur is the stepping stone to better poetry then so be it––but feel rubbed wrong that far better poets receive far less success and readership than someone who I feel represents this kind of Oprahfied, Disneyfied, Live.Laugh.Love-type of commodity literature that is tremendously popular by dint of its being unchallenging and broad.",

When the parents ask the tutor what the son should study, the tutor tells them that he should learn how to dance.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?",

I would like it to cover all the canonical authors and texts, from the Middle Ages/Renaissance up to the present. \n\nI care most about the period from 19th century onwards, as my goal is to have reading material that's useful as comprehensible input to improve my French, and so the long narrative prose of 19th-century novels are most helpful for that purpose.\n\nNevertheless, I welcome and seek suggestions for all periods of French literature. Feel free to offer suggestions for only certain periods based on what you know best. I'm wondering especially what would be the ideal reading order for the various authors within each literary period.",

I’ve read biographies of less interesting lives that were more emotionally involving than this novel. \n\nThe main romance: the relationship with &gt;!Celia st. James!&lt; felt dry and slightly abusive. \n\nI kept reading just to understand why she picked Monique beside the obvious choice &gt;!about the article on the right to die. That part was clear from the beginning since she was doing a memoir and refusing to say when she could publish!&lt;.  \nAs soon there was that scene with her driver Nick I had figured it out why she has chosen the protagonist and kept reading until the end to see if my suspicious were confirmed. \n\nIt felt shallow and a beach read at best. \nIt had zero emotional impact on me and I couldn’t form a bond with any of the characters except maybe Harry and her second maid. \n\n\n\nThoughts?",

Also, OP got roasted by Irish people for implying that Ulysses is the national epic of Ireland when An Táin exists, which amused me.\n\nMy issue is that a lot of people are saying that Moby Dick is the national epic of the US, but shouldn’t it be that a “national epic” is derived from mythology and/or folklore and/or oral traditions and/or general cultural consciousness? I don’t see how Moby Dick does that or even falls into the same category as the Iliad or the Shahnameh.\n\nAlso, a question: Why is Beowulf being unanimously considered the national epic of England and not The Canterbury Tales? I’m not a literature student or anything, so is there an reason why The Canterbury Tales isn’t being considered, or is this a “mass oversight” kind of situation?",

They both distinctly mention not being able to think of a way to climb down AND keep the rope.\n\nThis got me thinking…. Is there a way to tie a rope around a tree/stump/rock/etc. and still recover it at after climbing down? I would have imagined Tolkien could at the very least have invented a special elf technique or something. \n\nKeep in mind, I’m asking this mid-read and figure Gollum will somehow have the rope when he catches up to the hobbits.",
