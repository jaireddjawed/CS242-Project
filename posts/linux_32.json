I'm trying to write up rules for picking out webcams. My understanding is that each webcam has 2 device nodes, so it might have /dev/video3 and /dev/video4 and one of those is the actual video data and the other is metadata.\n\nWhen I check both devices for a single webcam, I find ATTR{index}==\"0\" on one device that, so far, is always the video stream (I have several webcams I'm experimenting with), and ATTR{index}==\"1\" is always the metadata.\n\nI have a few questions about this, including the obvious: Is this always the case? Will ATTR{index}==\"0\" always be the video stream? Is this a standard way to distinguish two different instances of the same device that are both on the same physical USB port? I'm interested, first, in being sure this is consistent, and, second, in understanding what's going on with this.",

For that reason, we have the freedesktop/XDG standards these days, that offer a lot of ways for applications to integrate into desktop environments in a platform-agnostic way. If there is no standardised way to do something, you will always have to deal with inconsistencies in applications (like setting the cursor theme and size, which there is to this day no standardised way for). \n\nSome things however work surprisingly consistent among desktop Linux applications since far longer than freedesktop exists. Among these are shortcuts for copying, cutting and pasting, handling of dead keys and compose keys and other things.\n\nI wonder: Are these specified anywhere? Is there some sort of official agreement to use e. g. ctrl + c for copying, and not cmd + c for example, or did application authors just happen to stick to the X window system conventions here? What if we need a new application wide shortcut standard that the X window system didn't provide (e. g. for opening an emoji selection popover, or we want to standardise a touch gesture)?",

        "text": "So I bought a Intel Arc 770 to use it with my new 4k monitor. I'm running Manjaro stable, but with the Kernel 6.2 rc1. It runs quiet well. I had a hard time get it to run on my old hardware (i7 4790k). I had to hack into the bios and flash it afterwards for getting the rebar feature, which the gpu needs. Without, I was only able to allocate 256mb vram.\n\nSo far it runs well. Performance in CSGO is great and a lot of other games run fine as well. Games which use the unreal engine have a hard time to run. I do not really know why. I tested them with different proton versions as well as proton ge. Without -dx12 the games do not start at all when using proton and are crashing my pc when I use proton ge. With -dx12 they do not crash. In the next days I will test with Manjaro unstable and the new Kernel 6.2 rc2. Maybe I will try to compile Mesa. If you are interested, I will keep you updated. \n\nI wish you all a happy new year.\n\nGreetz",

I am trying out an external Blu ray/DVD drive I just received, and am testing.\n\nI am using MthsTec external drive with USB and played a dc animated movie as my first test. Again, I am new. So, I just followed on screen prompting, as it asked me if I wanted to \"mount and play\" new recognized DVD. I did so, and using vlc, was able to play the DVD.\n\n\nI am now trying a DVD set of Naruto Shippuden, which I've owned for a couple of years now (purchased and shipped from southeast Asia, and not typical DVD format, from what I loosely researched). I didn't exactly look at time, but when I popped the new DVD in, I was simply asked the same prompt from before, to which I made the same selection.\n\n\nI would estimate the disc has been reading for at least 10 minutes now, no new folder path that I had received for the dc animated movie, which means I'm not sure where to direct vlc player to start/play disc. Additionally, the external drive is quite louder than the 1st disc, so, I've been assuming all this time, it is simply taking longer to read, then mount (which my beginner instinct tells me mounting creates the path that I received with the first disc?).\n\n\nI'm nervous to simply eject the disc, and didn't want to interrupt a possible necessary process, but also understand the nature of the disc may make it inevitable that it won't be read properly, the drive will continue working to read it (to ultimately mount it through Linux), and thus, making it impossible for a \"safe\" time to eject said disc. \n\n\n\nAny chance someone can assist/guide here? Apologies if this was posted in the wrong group.",

        "text": "A few years ago I put together a Distro Ranking based on the number of Reddit members for the distro's group. This is an update of that ranking.\n\nMost people new to Linux rely on DistroWatch (DW) for rankings. The DW rankings are based on page views of each of the distros followed by DW. Most people don't believe that the DW rankings accurately reflect the true popularity of the listed distros. For example, in November 2022, DW listed Arch as the 58th most popular distro, behind distros such as Voyager Linux, MakuluLinux, EuroLinux, and others you may not have heard of.\n\nAs an alternative, this project ranks the distros based on the number of members of their Reddit, group. Though it certainly is not perfect, it produces results that appear to better reflect the true popularity of the distros. Based of this methodology, Arch ranked ﻿#2﻿ behind Ubuntu. Looking at the top 10, everything appears reasonable.\n\nHere is the Google Sheet with the rankings:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ng-UeqrdBbf-LilUu0fXubglXfG3gM5YdUrl6jczr68/edit#gid=973687756](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ng-UeqrdBbf-LilUu0fXubglXfG3gM5YdUrl6jczr68/edit#gid=973687756)\n\nSome distros I was unable to find a Reddit group, it you are aware of one that I missed please send me a link to it and I will use it going forward. Also I may have picked up an incorrect group for some of the other distros. This is more likely to occur with less popular distros. Again, let me know if you notice a situation like this.\n\nEnjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments!",

        "text": "Hello! I have been doing research on the steam deck and noticed that its actually not a very powerful processor, it's an AMD APU with extra GPU cores and less CPU cores. I was wondering if anyone has ever tried to build a version of linux which is for emulation or gaming only, and maybe could get some positive results with a desktop AMD APU (such as 5600G)  \n\n\nWhat is the possibility a 5600G could be converted into a sort of \"arcade\" machine with a dedicated OS that makes it look clean on the front end? Thanks for your thoughts!",

And Happy New Year!\n\ncarbonOS is a new independent atomic distribution that does away with the legacy of packages and entirely focuses on providing a good experience with Flatpak and containers while being small and fast. Basically: I want to achieve the dream of a \"GnomeBook\"; an OS just as maintainence-free as Chrome OS and yet as powerful as a real desktop-class OS all while respecting the user's freedom. This update dropped my old custom Desktop Environment, and now carbonOS uses GNOME directly.\n\nFor more info, check the full [release announcement](https://carbon.sh/blog/2022-12-31-release.html). If you're interested in following development, check out /r/carbonOS. Thanks!",

I've spent the entire afternoon trying to figure this out and I just don't know.  \n\n\nI've downloaded and installed 5 different distros through virtual box (first, in order to decide which one I want to use permanently) and I'm experiencing sound output with a noticeably high pitch in every distro. First I thought it had to do with installing Brave Browser because it didn't happen until after I installed it and restarted, but I've tried it with other distros.... not installing brave/installing brave, installing a codec pack/and not, app update pack/not, installing pulseaudio and killing it in the terminal. Basically, trial and error to see what is causing/what might fix it because it doesn't happen on a fresh install....until just now when I installed a fresh KDE Neon and it happened immediately after the first startup, checking via youtube.   \n\n\nAt this point I'm ready to ditch the entire idea of switching to Linux altogether...(Devs, you want people to use Linux but they have problems right out of the box. WTF?) but I'm wondering if the conflict is simply with being in a virtual setting rather than being installed on a HD as a dedicated OS.  I could use some help before this makes me go insane, thanks.",
