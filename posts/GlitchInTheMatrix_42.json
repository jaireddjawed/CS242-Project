The next day when I got into work and plugged my phone into the computer it was 11:11. I thought it was ironic because I had just seen the video. Later that night after work, having not used my phone in a while, I checked it. It was 11:11.\n\nThe next day. Same thing. 11:11 at work plugging my phone in, and 11:11 at night; albeit me having checked it about 3 times unlike the first night - so not as 'random' but coincidentally it was a 3rd time. \n\nThen the last night, after signing into Facebook for the first time since having gone to work that day, [I see this](http://i.imgur.com/ouYbI.jpg).

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/vvhtb/ive_never_truly_told_this_story_before_my_glitch/",
        "text": "Years ago, when I was still a teenager, I went shopping with my dad at Walmart. He had a seizure; it was scary; the end. &lt;-- that's  the story I've related to friends and family in the past. Here's what really happened:\n\nI was a fourteen-year-old young lady, and I was shopping at Walmart with my dad, a friend of mine and a few of my small siblings. We were on vacation, and this was a strange Walmart in a strange place, and thus it took a little longer than we expected to find all of our items. Dad said he wasn't feeling well.\n\nIn the checkout line, I turn around and start glancing through all those last minute, impulse items. Gum, candy, magazines. I glance at my dad, and he's staring at the ceiling. \"Dad?\" I ask. He doesn't reply. He doesn't blink. His eyes remain fixated on the ceiling above me -- but there's nothing there.\n\n*\"Dad??\"* I ask again, more insistently. Something's wrong.\n\nThis is where the break happens. One moment, I'm looking at my dad who is staring at the ceiling with his mouth slightly ajar... the next moment I'm kneeling on the floor about six feet away, my dad lying flat on his back on the floor, his head at my knees, my hands cradling the sides of his head. I'm calling out loudly, panicked: \"Dad -- dad! DAD! Dad!\" He doesn't answer and his body straingtens and strains -- every muscle in his body is tight, he's struggling with every ounce of energy he has but is not moving at all.\n\nEveryone around us simply stands and stares.\n\nHe's not breathing. I can hear someone screaming \"DAD!\" and realize it's still me.\n\nWithin a few moments of my panicked screams, off-duty firefighters who happened to be nearby in the store come over. They don gloves, they assess his vitals and ask questions. \"Did he hit his head?\" one firefighter asks me. \n\n\"I don't know, I don't know,\" I lament. I'm wringing my hands. I don't know. Dad fell, he's on the floor, he must have hit his head, right?\n\nA bystander (my young friend) chimes in: \"No, he didn't hit his head. She caught him!\"\n\nThe firefighters are able to call an ambulance. My dad grunts and a mouthful of blood comes pouring across his lips. I'm convinced he's dying; people on TV always cough up blood as they die.\n\nHe reaches the hospital. He lives. Life goes on as normal, eventually.\n\n--\n\nWhat I can't figure out, even more than a decade later, is that break in time while dad fell. One moment I was looking at my father and the next, he was lying on the floor and I was six feet away from where'd I'd been standing, cradling his head in my hands. My friend, the witness, says I caught my dad as he fell, but I don't remember an iota of that action. I don't remember contemplating, \"hey, maybe he's going to fall\" or \"I should walk over here to see if dad's okay...\" Nothing. \n\nIt's like I blinked, and reality shifted around me. I'm told I calmly walked over to my father, grabbed him at the shoulders, and guided him backwards to the floor as he fell, keeping his head from hitting the floor. I was 5'2\" and 95 pounds at the time ... my giant father should have crushed me as he fell. I don't know how I would have managed it.\n\nI've always told myself I just didn't remember because of the stress, but it's truly a glitch in my matrix, and sometimes my mind runs wild trying to fill that gap. Did time jump? Did another conciousness take over my body momentarily to do what needed to be done? Did I somehow travel to another reality? Did my dad see something above us that he shouldn't have? Did the MIB have me look at that flashy-memory-stick thing?\n\nAnd how convenient was it that paramedic-trained firefighters were standing three lines over when this happened? What are the chances of that happening?\n\nTL;DR: As an adolescent, I somehow I walked six steps and caught a full grown seizing man, all without any conscious thought on my part, all without straining a single muscle. I blinked, and I was suddenly somewhere else, and things had happened. Somehow, firefighters happened to be in the exact right place at the exact right time. That's my glitch.\n\nThanks for listening. I haven't talked about this in over ten years but it still bothers me. I hadn't lost any time before this incident, and I haven't since. I still think about it often.",

        "text": "I posted this in r/wtf and was told I should post it here:\n\nI have a friend who every time I put her phone number into my phone and try to call it it calls someone else. I always assumed this was a glitch on my phone. She assured me several times that I had the right number but it would persist to call someone else.\n\nAnyways, one day - after recently inputting it again to be sure - I text her a question from a retail shop. I send her a picture of two hats I'm looking at and ask her her opinion on pink or black (I realize how dumb this sounds) but when she responded \"black\" I knew it wasn't her. So I asked for confirmation of who this was and they said it was \"Ryan\" (names have been changed). Ryan? I don't even know a Ryan. How would his number get in my phone.\nHe told me he was surprised to hear from me. That we'd met years ago. I didn't understand. I'd only had this phone for a few months. I'd had the number for about 4 years. Then, I realized who it was and I was shocked.\n\nIt was a guy who I had met when I was 21 while working at a bar in San Francisco (I'm 29 now, so this is nearly a decade ago). He was really nerdy and all alone, but seemed really nice, so I took him to a party with me and - after having one too many (hey, I was 21, we've all made bad decisions...) I took him home with me. He told me he was a virgin then and I took his virginity.\n\nThe only other time I remember ever seeing him is one night, shortly after that, before playing a show (I'm a musician) he showed up in a car full of frat boys who - after I acknowledged knowing him - all pointed at me saying \"SHE'S REAL!\" Then got in their car and left.\n\nAfter that the next interaction we had was 8 years later through this random text.\n\nI never had his number. EVER. And he never had the number I have now. How was it possible that I accidentally texted him when trying to text my friend? We don't have ANY of the some friends. He doesn't know anyone I know so there's no way he could've gotten my number from them.\n\nI suppose it is possible he could've looked me up on facebook and contacted a friend for my number but he never knew my real name because I went by a different last name then and none of my friends are that dumb. One of my friends thinks he somehow \"hacked\" my cell phone. I don't even know how this is possible. Also, he doesn't work for any cell phone carriers. In fact, he's studying to be a cop.\n\nWTF? Reddit. Seriously. WTF?\n\nTLDR?: While trying to contact my friend I accidentally texted a guy I met once, for one night, nearly 10 years ago. I never had his number and only in recent years got the number I have now, so how the fuck was that possible?",

        "text": "I met a neighbor of mine for the first time at the peak of a mountain 6 states away while peaking on the most acid and shrooms I've ever taken. We were sitting at the peak of this mountain when he comes up with a group and naturally chit-chat gets yapping. He asks where we're from and he went to the same university as us. Pretty normal, but then he asks what highschool. My eyes widen with amazement as we realize we went to the same high school. It gets better. Same elementary school. Same STREET! Same LACROSSE TEAM! We were separated by 3 years and lived on the same street the whole time but I had never met him in my life until I was the farthest from my house I've ever been. About a year later I left my jacket at a restaurant, only to return to find him sitting in the exact seat I left it at an hour later....\n\nAnother time on acid I lost my wallet and six hours later it turned up perfectly undisturbed outside my friends door in the middle of the hallway of his apartment complex. Theres no way it would've stayed there all day and if anybody had found it, I didn't live there. No idea how that happened to this day.\n\nOne time on shrooms my gf and I were walking in the woods when it got too muddy and we had to turn back. We were talking about how my mother was a germophobe and was always like 'Don't put that in your mouth' etc when I was young and curious and how her mother was different and how that was the reason she was sticking her hands into rotting logs and I wasn't. I think theres more explanation. Anyways seconds after talking about this we encounter a young mother with a 8-10ish year old son. He runs ahead while we stop to tell her about the mud. She calls ahead to her son to come back and we hear him shout 'YIPPPEEWAHHOOOO' playing in the mud. The exact situation we just talked about manifested itself.\n\nAnother time on acid I was at a very crowded music festival 'think 1000's of people' and I was tripping one of the hardest I'd ever been. I decided to close my eyes and dance my heart and just fully embrace the trip. (Info, I was with a girl who I kinda liked who was tripping for her first time) Anyways I'm dancing when all of a sudden I hear a scream and someone jumps on me. I open my eyes and in my arms is this girl that I had been in love with for like 2 years but hadn't talked to in about a year since a messy situation occured. Anyways she clearly has put it behind her since she jumped on me, meanwhile I didn't know she was even going to be there let alone actually find me. And I still loved her. But her and the girl I was camping with were like oil and water. They hated eachother. All of this flash through my mind in literally a second (mind you while I'm experiencing major time dilation) so what did I do? I picked her up and ran. Happiest I've ever been. For about 2 minutes.",

        "text": "The comment about jumping off a swing and covering ridiculous distances jarred this back into my memory.\n\nWhen I was about 9-10 I would play on an old swingset that I had in my back garden with a few friends from the neighbourhood. We'd do the usual stuff - who can jump the: highest, furthest, fastest, \"coolest\", spin the most in mid-air... you get the idea.\n\nSo getting bored with the same old game, someone suggests doing the above with our eyes closed. Obviously we expect closing our eyes to make this balls to the wall amazing and I suppose it was alright for a while but anyway.\n\nMy turns comes around and I think I was going to try for distance so I sit on the swing, close my eyes and start rocking. All is well, I can feel the swing reaching the highest/fastest I can make it so I time myself and I jump.\n\nI feel myself going up and after that I don't really remember feeling anything. I was aware that I should have felt gravity giving me a sharp look, telling me to get back down here now but I didn't; for some reason it just never registered with me. I was suspended for what at the time, to me, seemed like at least thirty seconds. I just existed in this state of neutral buoyancy which is like nothing I have ever felt before.\n\nI didn't hear anything, I didn't feel gravity's pull or any wind resistance over my travels. I couldn't see and I couldn't, and can't, feel or imagine what position my limbs were at this time. It was as if I had truly disconnected myself from my body and existed as a pure  conciousness for those brief moments.\n\nNeedless to say gravity hadn't forgotten about me, I suspect I had merely forgotten about it so when I hit the ground, I wasn't braced or prepared for it. My feet hit the ground and I simply collapsed as my body failed to respond to the change of circumstance. I wasn't hurt by the fall but my friends couldn't understand why I hit the deck the way I did. They also couldn't understand why when they got me I was smiling and why I was asking them, 'Did you see that? Was there anything weird about that jump?'. Predictably, the answer was, 'Yeah, you hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.'\n\nTo this day, I can't explain what or how it happened. I have difficulty explaining the sensation itself but I know what it felt like. I am a skeptic; I tend not to believe things without evidence but my perspective of what happened it incontrovertible to me. I know it happened, because I experienced it. \n\nI won't lie, I have tried to replicate that feeling through meditation exercises and before I go to bed. I can in some instances make myself believe that I've shut off my body but it's never felt as natural, or as complete, as it did that day.\n\nAnyway, that's enough of my incessant rambling but that's my \"Matrix Moment\" or as close as I've come to one.",

        "text": "\nI had the misfortune of spending the night in jail in Sacramento when I was 19.  \nI wasn't (that) drunk, but had smoked some weed a few hours earlier.  I was with friends who were drinking furiously, ran a red light and got pulled over in my yellow VW Beetle and Duran Duran hair.\nThis was 1987, mind you.\nBefore being finger printed and put in the holding cell, I took the obligatory urine test.\nWhile in one of the holding cells amongst the drunk and unclean, a kid about my age, dressed all in white (as if he was working in the kitchen, say) proceeded to come up to the plexiglass, place small peice of paper up to it, and motioned for me to come over.\nHe was nondescript. Plain looking. Generic even. Just another white ass white guy.\nOn the paper he had written \"do you know (some girl's name that I didn't recognize)?\nHe didn't really express any sort of emotion, he just stared at me.  When I shrugged and motioned through the glass that I did not know the girl in question, he took the paper from the glass, put it in his pocket, turned and left.\nIt was an odd interaction, but being my first (and only) time in jail, I had more survival-type thoughts I was occupied with.\nI was released in the morning, and the following week I called downtown to retrieve my paperwork before I called a lawyer.\nThere was nothing under my name or case number. Not a damn thing.\nNow, I subscribe to /r/atheism and don't even remotely believe in the notion of guardian angels.\nBut it really tripped me out.\nStill does.",

        "text": "I was driving home one day with my parents and my brother a couple of years ago. As we were driving down a \"Main\" road (Main road, but not often traveled) in Los Angeles, there was a blue flash in the sky and some of the power went out including the streetlights. The power INSIDE the car actually dimmed a little so bit. We just kept on driving like usual, everything went on like normal. Looked in the news for anything about a flash, couldn't find anything. The power just went back on after a while\n\nTL;DR: Flash in Sky. Power Outage. Everything goes on like normal afterwards.",

        "text": "Dog died back in 2003. When we buried him I grabbed his favorite ball and wrote his name on it, and then buried it with him. Next morning I woke up and the ball was on the floor right next to my bed. It was very surreal but it was somewhat comforting at the same time.\n\nedit for one more story: My best friend tried to tell me that his house was haunted and that if he demanded an answer from the 'spirits' or whatever they would give him the answer in his head. Well needless to say I had to test him on this, and since I had just changed my AIM (oldschool, yes) password I told him to guess it. Well he gets into this weird trance-like state and says something along the lines of \"Tell me the answer mother fucker\" and then he just stops, gets this weird look on his face, looks right at me and says \"bob barker.\" He nailed it. I nearly shit myself.\n\nTL;DR: My backyard is a pet semetary and my best friend is psychic.\n",

        "text": "So basically my Great Aunt was the primary cook for a lot of our family get togethers. But she always had this thing were she'd place out extra plates. For example there would be 12 of us there and she would set out 15 plates, miraculously three people would show up who were unexpected or told us they weren't coming otherwise. This happened with 100% success on multiple occasions. \n\nPersonally I think she was really good at reading people's intentions, much like I am, and that it gets passed along every few generations or so. I for one am very good at poker, but the way I play is that I don't look at my cards at all, this also translates well into diffusing difficult situations and has saved my life a few times. The other day I'm sitting at a green light going left and decided to not try and go on the yellow and sure enough some guy ends up blowing right through and runs a red light.",

        "text": "I'm really glad you've brought this up. Me and a friend were out the other night going for a looong walk and getting high, its a thing we do quite a lot. At one point we were looking up at the stars and clouds, and we both noticed this cloud that was in the shape of, as we thought at the time, two dragons fighting each other side by side, a bit like a yin-yang circle, with a Star Destroyer off to the side. \nAnyway, we'd been walking for quite some time, 2 or 3 hours, and both look up and this exact same cloud formation was in the sky, as if it had been hanging there all night, it was fucking identical. Blame it on the weed if you want, but this formation was there exactly the same, even the fucking moon looked like it had stayed in the same place. We both got freaked out by the weirdness of it all, we cut the walk short and went home.\n\nWoke up in the morning and were both still really confused about it all. \nAside from the 'you were high' argument, has anyone got any ideas how this could have happened? My friend and I  have been texting about it for nearly 3 days now, and we are still completely freaked out\n\nedit: Also, we saw the clouds before we started smoking, and afterwards we were both around a [4]. Oh and we played the 'Yes &amp; No' game, and both kept getting the other's within 3 questions ( are u a man, are you real, are you Johnny Depp?) Which was also really weird.",

One of the people who replied claimed he had a tool that could determine if a picture is shopped or not. Does that tool actually work? How does one use it? Because if we had a way to filter which pictures are shopped it would definitely improve the quality of content here.",
