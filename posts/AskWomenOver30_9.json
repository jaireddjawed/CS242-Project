        "text": " Last year was hell. My boyfriend of 4 years ghosted me slowly. I am from Asia and he is German, we met while studying. Before I started the relationship ( this is our first), we were friends, then it became more like fwb...and then a relationship. Before I entered the relationship, I had told him that I have fear of abandonment by people who love me ( my parents had to move abroad for work as a child and I grew up with my grandparents..  was bullied in school...was lonely as fuck..was hell). I had told him all the things that I didn't like in me such as mood swings, depressive episodes .. things like I don't see myself living abroad from my family... when we started sleeping around I figured out that I didn't like penetrative sex and I didn't want to do anything about it..so I also asked him if he would be okey for long term commitment provided his sex life is going to be..not good..I asked him for months (3-4) about if he is really okey if he would leave me half way cause of sexual compatibility or other for someone else...he always assured me .he won't..that we will find a way together and figure it out.\n\n I told him I might be on the borderline spectrum, but I am on therapy and I will get better with issues that I have. But after about 6 months in to the relationship I broke up, he looked grumpy whenever he had to come via masturbation, he was too introvert and was not sharing this emotions or thoughts.. I also wasn't sure if I loved him ..plus I come from a conservative family..so I felt overwhelmed and I broke up. This was during his master thesis and he was fucked up. I didn't know it would fuck him up like that, he told me he puked blood and moved back to his parents place. I didn't love him as much as he loved me and I talked to my therapist about this ..she told me it's a gift and I should learn to accept it without having to give back the same. And I got back with him within a month of breaking up. I saw the hurt I caused, I promised myself that I will never leave him from my side and I am going to allow me to love without fear. I won't let fear of a heartbreak take away this love that life has offered. And through all of this I never told him I love him, it was only with time that I fell in love ( ~8 months after the relationship). By then I had already introduced him to my family and friends. My family was against the relationship cause he was from west and there is this stereotype ( also cause my parents lived abroad) people changing their partners too often. So my parents were against this and I stood up for us. I didn't talk to my pay for months cause they wanted me to leave him.\n\nAround one year into the relationship, my boyfriend becomes less invested.. he has told me he suffers from depressive episodes..so for six months he moves back to his parents in a different city. Comes back, gets annoyed about lack of sex life...but I can see he doesn't want to be annoyed but can't help himself. Says needs time off which is for days...I on the other hand can't sit with conflict and need to clear things and have peace as soon as possible, so this triggers anxiety in me. I am struggling with studies , part-time work and lack of friends in the place I live ( it's small German uni town with very few international) and he is supportive through all this by saying encouraging things but also distant. For example, we both lived in an all German student dorm (with 7 others), there were couple of incidents which was hurtful for me ( once the shared money was missing and 2 of them implied that might be me..or when something is dirty pointing at me or playing only German games when every night when they all knew English, but refusing to accomodate me atleast once in a while). Whenever there were problems of this sort, my boyfriend who hates conflict of any sort stayed silent. This led to alot of tension in our relationship cause it made we feel like we are not a team. He again has depressive episodes and moves back to his parents for few months,  then COVID starts... He stays with his parents and I am in the student wg alone (as everyone else moved back to their family as they are from nearby villages). We talk everyday on phone..He visits for few weeks after 7/8 months.. he is annoyed again about his boring sex life. . being an introvert he just bottles up and gives me silent treatment for days.. when he visits he is always working on his side projects...and he is taking antidepressants so he is always tired and sleeps for 8-10 hours, then plays video games and does music...we have never cooked together, play games or nothing..my therapist asked me what do we do together..my only answer was sex..also everytime I touch him or cuddle him friendly he gets an errection and then he is upset cause it's painful for him..I don't know what to do cause I feel turned off by it cause I think \" he is always thinking about only sex\".  Maybe he is not ...but it turns me off ... anyways he needs a lot of time off, he has 2 friends with whom he is not very close but also doesn't want to make new friends cause social interactions tires him out.  He starts working on his startup idea.. codes from morning until night, doesn't want to go for a walk, doesn't talk or shares how he feels...I move back to my country for six months or so.. we talk everyday.. I get burnt out , but had to return in a days notice back to Germany cause my extension gets rejected.. he is living with his parents.. working on his start-up at this time...I don't have a place to return and he knows this,  I only have two days to find a place and I don't have much money, I am really burnt out.. he knows.. he doesn't offer to let me stay at his house.. I didn't ask.. I  write to every single person offering a sublet in Germany and by chance the only place I found is in the same city as him. Before coming back cause I was burnt out I didn't want to come back..but there was a risk that in future cause of not having a visa I might not be able to come back, so I asked my boyfriend if he can marry me for visa in the future or atleast in the case that I am unable to do it on my own ( I have never brought up marriage before as I don't really believe in wedding and stuff). He says maybe. \n\nI think that might be when he.turned cold. His maybe was so weird that I decided against taking the risk of chucking my visa and came back to Germany to keep my options open for future. My family had packed for him home cooked food, he refuses it saying he might fall sick as there are stories of people from west getting food poison while traveling in Asia. I had the room in his city for one month, during that one month he says he has only hours every week to meet me cause he is working on his start-up  I can stay over with him at his parents place for one night every week. Here, I felt I didn't have any power left, everything was on his terms. I was really burnt out and was missing home, there was money stress..I didn't have any stability..I had to start applying for jobs.. I had to find a long term place to stay.. but this sudden change in my boyfriend to being so cold and me having no power or say just fucked me up. When I confronted him about this, he starts crying and complaining about how he is wasting his 20's away without an active sex life cause of me and how he feels lonely. I had stopped asking him about how his day was few months ago cause I felt whenever is asked him details he would give a one line answer and says he doesn't want to talk about it and it would make him feel grumpy.. I asked him I did tell him about the sex life like 3.5 years ago when we started the relationship and he told me that he thought I was shy and would warm up to it or that it was cause of my cultural background and would change with time and in the beginning he was madly in love with me but now he is still in love but not as madly that he can be without sex, I tell him we can find a solution and I can work towards it or if he wants to break up that's hurtful but we can do that... He says we will try for a year and if it doesn't improve we will break up.\n\nAfter that month I wasn't able to find a place and he takes me in for three weeks. His parents were very welcoming but he turns I don't know colder. First day I moved in he wanted to have sex and I felt like a prostitute in a way cause I was staying at his place now and I didn't want to have sex to be nice.. I think he realized that..but after that he wanted me to spend the whole day outside in the library where I would apply for jobs and only return in the night after dinner. His parents on the other hand would ask me why do I have to go to the library in the winter and with covid still around and not just do it from there home. So somedays I would stay back home instead of going to the library and he would become so cold. Two weeks into my stay at his place was his birthday, that was his deadline to be ready with the first prototype for his startup and he missed it. His parents put so much effort to make his birthday such a beautiful day, I have never seen someone look this depressed around beauty and love. The next day, he locks himself in his room for I don't know 5/6 days. He refuses to talk or see anyone. I am there with his parents every night for dinner and it's very awkward. When we talk next he asks me to start taking antidepressants cause he thinks I am depressed, I go to psychiatrist explain my situation and he is not sure whether I am depressed or just a shitty situation. As I start antidepressants he moves me to an Airbnb and tells me I have five days to figure out where to go next. The antidepressants starts giving me panic attacks and the events that happened made me feel sick and disoriented    I am in an Airbnb couple of kilometers away from his parents place, the guy I thought loved me is acting like a stranger... I am burnt out, I have to figure out what to do...the antidepressants made me suicidal/ sleepless..he visits me twice for an hour during those days cause I begged him as I was getting panic attacks. \n\nI moved back to my student city. My boyfriend doesn't talk much but says cause he is sick/ depressed. I am left with confusion...at this point I was in contact with only couple of my other friends all not living in the city. My boyfriend says he can only text and we can talk soon in sometime and it will be fine.  In January 1st, he breaks up for the first time cause I confronted him over something days before new year and he broke up cause he said he was scared that I will break up with him and that stopped him from having a good time on new year with his friends. He invited me for Christmas but it was more like if you really want to come, we would be happy to have you.. so didn't go but he made me a Christmas art as always. I can't handle the break up, I apologize for confronting him and begs him to take me back and he does.\n\nHe doesn't talk or text for months last year and always said he was depressed and sleeping. I restarted therapy and was forced to confront him. He then breaks up around May. There was no discussion nothing but just a decision after giving me hope for months saying it will get better. He says he can't talk about it , he doesn't give a reason.. I am having panic attack and my therapist says it will get better with time and that shows narcissistic tendency. I went crazy, I kept pleading.  ...my sense of who I was gone. The person who promised to never let me go turned in to a total stranger in days..  I messaged him for days but he would not engage... I  feel betrayed. I feel heartbroken. I am unable to function for months now or almost an year. He blamed me for him not meeting his deadline for his startup stuff. He is saying he is not in a place for relationship, which I understand but the way he dropped me affected my self esteem. \n\nMy friend who saw me recently told me I have become a shell of who I was before. I feel lost, I recently discovered his attachment style was dismissive avoidant if that makes any sense. He never gave me a closure, I had told him earlier in the relationship that I something like this would be devastating for me. I don't think his parents who how he was towards the end. In my culture it's common to involve family, I know I can't force anyone to love me but I feel he emotionally abused me. I feel broken and unable to trust anyone. I went against my family for this person so I haven't even told my family about the breakup. I pretend everything is fine otherwise they will get worried. I felt I always worked on my issues,.I regret wasting my time, attention and energy on him. But mostly I hate who I have become. I had moved out of my country for a better life and carrier.  I am unable to shake this off and recover. \n\nI want to write to his parents... ( maybe cause they also fund him) To let them know that their son ghosted me, has no backbone to deal with conflicts and is a accountable for hurting me and breaking my trust. I am fine if you break up, but not when they know I am at my worst place .. that I don't have support system to help me through it.. it could have been respectful where they problem and try to find a solution that works for both of us and not just run way. \n\nShould I write to his parents ?",

        "text": "There is this girl at my office, let’s call her Helen. Helen is about as plain jane and boring as I have ever meet in life. To give some examples of why I think this are things even though she isn’t shy (and is a self-proclaimed extrovert) is how she never thinks anything is funny and her ability to be excitable taps out to barely noticing that she even enjoys anything in life. Aside from her clear obsession with her husband’s best friend (but that is an entire other story).\n\nAnd obviously she is allowed to be that way. It’s her life, as long as she does her work and doesn’t cause drama than whatever. \n\nI try to ignore this fact that I see her as about as milk toast as humanly possible and I am always as nice to her as I can possibly be. I actually do a better than average job being nice to her. At best I question her on certain statements she makes; just to try and be thought provoking.\n\nThe problem is sometimes (aka daily) Helen is rude about people not being bored like her. She calls a lot of people weird for being more emotive and making jokes that are in no way offensive (just want to make sure that’s clear). Considering that no one in our office has ever told her anything like this I think it’s very unwarranted. \n\nAny advice? I am trying my best to hold it in, and I am no saint, although I’d love to act like a better person. Every part of me wants to just tell her “they aren’t weird you are just boring.”. Mostly likely I’ll not be able to address this at work but maybe I could do something like write letters letting out my frustration and then burning them.",

        "text": "I’m over 30 and I’ve been a software engineer for over 5 years now. The work itself is interesting, definitely frustrating a lot of the time. But I typically feel engaged throughout the day. But there are so many difficult personalities. I just changed companies a month ago and I’m having a really hard time with my manager. I’m isolated and a team of 1 right now, and there really isn’t anyone at the company I can connect with. I literally know no one else at the company because my manager doesn’t have me interacting with any teams. And it’s a WFH role. Manager doesn’t want to hear my feedback. I asked for opportunities to shadow other engineers and to virtually meet the team, but he feels that is a waste of time. Oh, and today he called out a mistake I made and said I should not have made that mistake if I was a real engineer and at my salary level. It was an honest mistake, and because I didn't have the full requirements. Nothing happened because of the mistake, and I did learn from it. All this to say, I know I cannot make it work at this company and I need to leave. I’ve at least made that decision.\n\nBut I don’t know what I want to do AFTER leaving. I don’t know if my unhappiness in my current role is just making me dramatic, and I’m overreacting. Basically, I don’t know if I’m feeling unhappy and dumb and unfulfilled because of the current company or if it’s tech in general. \n\nI’m concerned I will never feel happy or settled in a tech role because I am a very emotional person, and the typical personalities I work with aren’t like this. I’m wondering if it’s not just the job that’s not a good fit, but the entire industry.\n\nHow can I tell the difference? How do I know if an entire career is not right for me? And, if it’s not right for me, how do I figure out what to pursue next? Like, if I decide I don’t want to be a software engineer anymore, how do I decide what to pursue instead? How do I even know what will make me happy and fulfilled? I went into tech for financial security and so I could pursue my hobbies in my free time. But why isn’t that not enough? I tried making my passion a full time job, and that just made me anxious. I feel like “working to live”, not “living to work” is the right path for me at least. \n\nI feel like I was supposed to have this figured out 10 years ago. My time in tech is also feeling like a sunk cost situation and I’m feeling extremely trapped. Do fulfilling remote roles at $150k roles even exist outside of software engineering? Maybe I should just be grateful for the salary and stability.",

        "text": "Oops, this got a lot longer than I had planned. Apparently I really needed to vent. **Tl;dr: a very bitter soon to be 30y old without any friends doesn’t know how to not spend her birthday crying in bed because her life just sucks so much. Advice or personal anecdotes would be very much appreciated.** \n————————————-\n\n\nFirst of all I want to say that I know this is a first world problem and in the grand scheme of things, who cares. I‘m not even a birthday person, I haven’t celebrated since my 18th. But. I always thought 30 would be different, and I pictured this whole Pinterest fantasy with the balloons and the fancy cake and the happy friends and breakfast in bed made by my loving partner.\n\nWell, back to real life. My birthday is on Tuesday. My (ex)girlfriend left me right before I was supposed to move in with her (we were in a long distance relationship for 10 months but lived together for 2 years before). The relationship was getting more abusive over time which left me very isolated but I was already working on making new friends. Because I am a fool and a clown and an idiot and traveled to see my ex whenever I could I developed those precious new friendships in HER city. As you can tell I did not see the breakup coming at all, let’s hope I’ll be wiser in my thirties. For now I don’t have people to spend the day with it. I’ve been trying to be social in my own town again but was very busy with being depressed over my ex leaving me, and didn’t have enough time to get to know anyone well enough to admit to them that I have no one else and no plans for my birthday.  \n\nMy original plan was to go to the spa and pretend it’s self care. \nAnd it didn’t even make me feel like a loser, because life was pretty awful lately with the whole breakup/not moving/having to beg for my job back/having to unpack all my stuff that didn’t even get to leave the house after being packed for a month/ having to buy new shit after having given so much of it away already because god forbid we have to deal with owning TWO TOASTERS/trying to be friends with my ex/ realizing she was abusive/trying to stop talking to my ex/writing my dissertation/ignoring my exes mails after she’s been blocked elsewhere/downloading and deleting tinder- thing. \n\nUnfortunately due to all of the above I also got sick somehow and lost a lot of weight and a lot of hair and my skin went crazy, with some sort of rash. My derm doesn’t know what it is or how to treat it but he told me to avoid pools and heat. I also take antibiotics now because it just kept getting worse so I’m also not allowed to drink. *Side note: yes I do feel like the prettiest princess at the ball every time I look in the mirror and see the red flaky skin and dark circles. whenever someone at work asks me something lovely like wether I have Covid again or offers me food and says I look like I haven’t eaten in a month I think “wow this must be the post-breakup glow up everyone is talking about” and just feel sooo happy:)*\n\n\nANYWAY. Because of the dissertation I spend a lot of time alone at home and I do **not** enjoy my own company. I know taking yourself out on a date is the number one recommendation for people who will otherwise be alone  because I’ve been procrastinating my actual research by googling “things to do by yourself on your birthday that aren’t super sad” very excessively.  I might be able to convince myself to sit down for a cup of tea with myself, but that’s it. am over always having to be around me. I listen to podcasts when showering because I don’t want to listen to my own thoughts, and I can’t remember the last time I fell asleep without background noise. \n\nI’d love to just go to work but already took the day off months ago and can’t change it anymore.\n\nI could meet my mom for breakfast - while I appreciate the gesture I have to add that I asked her to do literally anything else, even lunch, but she works and has plans after work (…..) so it’s either breakfast at 8 or nothing. Also our relationship is not amazing, she will definitely say something about my future boyfriends and how I should bring a guy home now that my “roommate“ who she refused to ever meet seems to be gone. I came out to her as a lesbian 10 years ago. \n\n\nI am worried I will spiral on my birthday and spend the day hating myself and crying in bed and, worst case, call my ex and let her know I’m actually miserable without her. I need to find ways to prevent that. I will force myself to go on a walk and write into a stupid gratitude journal and I will bake a cake on Monday and decorate it with fancy  and glamorous edible hearts and glitter. Maybe I will cook a nice meal, even thingy I hate cooking and I don’t think it’s fair to have to do the dishes on my already not so amazing birthday. I will see about that.\n\nAfter all this there is still an entire day left though. \n\nDoes anyone know what else I can do? Preferably something that isn’t too depressing or too expensive, and doesn’t involve any sort of self reflection. I’d also very much appreciate stories about your own shitty birthdays and how you survived them and how it made you stronger and better and just turned you into a very happy and great person. Is 40 the new special birthday so that I have ten more years to prepare and hopefully get it right for that one? I also wouldn’t mind some compelling arguments for going with the easiest plan (crying and calling my ex).",

He’s gained weight, he’s grouchy and honestly he’s always kind of sucked with intimacy (in our younger years I had more of a sex drive to make up for his lack of intimacy).\n\nOn top of this, he has a poorly managed medical condition that causes a lot of GI issues and frankly, it’s kind of gross. He often doesn’t feel good and I wish he’d take better care of himself to avoid some of these issues.\n\nHe’s not a terrible person. He’s a good partner and I love him.\n\nBut what do I say to him? Do I tell him my honest feelings?\n\nHave any other women been through this sort of thing?",

Importantly, I have not yet met any of his friends.\n\nHe recently posted a photo on social media with some friends of his that immediately raised a flag for me because through this photo, I realized we had a mutual connection. He is friends with a woman I used to work in college who I am not fond of. For the sake of this, I'll refer to her as J. It turns out J is his best friend's fiancee. \n\nWhile me and J never got along, I don't really have an issue with her specifically. She was generally pretty rude and off-putting, but the bigger issue was the people she was friends with. Our workplace was staffed by a bunch of college students and there was a LOT of drama. J was part of a group of people who tended to bully others in the workplace, including myself, though I don't recall any instances of J herself being the bully. She was just often there while others were bullying. She was also close friends with the biggest bully in the group, but as far as I know, they are not friends anymore.\n\nSeeing that this guy is friends with J immediately brought me back to all of the college drama and bullying. It also made me nervous that interacting with him means eventually interacting with J, potentially regularly. The emotional part of me is writing him off. If these are the friends he keeps, what does that say about him? The logical part of my brain is telling me I'm being too sensitive. For all I know, J is a better person and isn't indicative of the friends he keeps. Is this a reason to end this early and move on? Or am I being too driven by the emotions of old memories?",

I understand that the woman who is being asked out can feel sort of \"trapped\", for lack of a better word, in either situation. It makes sense if she just wants some food and the creepy dude behind the counter is laying on the moves, or conversely she is just trying to do her job and provide friendly customer service which is often misread by male customers as \"she's into me\".\n\nBut if its someone that you see regularly, and they have thrown out some pretty strong signals (flirting, asking about his home life, going out of her way to say hi when not really necessary, etc.), is it really that weird/unprofessional?",

        "text": "I'm posting because I'm hoping someone can reassure me my boundary makes sense and deserves to be respected without having to explain it. Perhaps even offer me some insight into how to navigate this and how to communicate to my friend so that she stops taking this personally and just respects my needs. I'm trying to find ways to do this without being an asshole, but I'm definitely judging her for not just accepting the boundary exists and respecting it.  \n\n\nMy boundary is: When I'm hosting an evening in my home, I want my friend to ask me before she invites other people. It doesn't matter who it is: her brother, a mutual friend, someone she vouches for, etc. If she wants to invite another person, swing it by me first.   \n\n\nWhenever this topic comes up (twice now), a lot of tension rises between us. I try to be gentle with delivering the boundary, such as the second time it happened I said, \"gentle reminder that I'd like to be asked before you invite other people to my home\".   \n\n\nShe tells me she doesn't understand it. Both times this tense, long conversation happened. She tells me it comes off as exclusive (she values inclusivity) and she doesn't know how to navigate conversations with people where \"in the moment she wants to invite them\" (as opposed to noting her desire, checking in with me, then inviting them). She also thinks this boundary is in place because I don't trust her.  \n\n\nI have offered her reassurance the boundary is not personal to her or anyone else, and I explained it exists because I want control over my front doors. I consider it polite to ask a host to invite more guests before doing so. But she still doesn't understand and I can see this is because she is assessing my boundary through the lens of her own value system, rather than accepting it as it is. I also sense her judging the boundary and I feel inclined to justify it (but I really dont want to justify boundaries to anyone). She has a tendency to take things personally and is an anxious person, and her mind got super caught up in this word \"control\" which she said \"doesnt sit right for her\".   \n\n\nAnyway. I'd love a reflection from you ladies. Thank you.",

But I have a question for women in my attempts to understand the opposite sex. Would any of you say you feel love \"sacrificially\" like some men do? Even beyond say the normalized gender roles? Like Men being providers, fighters etc.. Just curious if any women know what I'm talking about, where you feel like you could lay down your life for a man?\n\nI hate say it, but my cynicism and jadedness has me kind of thinking of things like how bears in the wild behave. Like the momma bear will do anything for the cubs. But the males tend to just do their own thing. My personal experiences with women are unfortunately with ones looking for resources mainly. So I really want to change my perspective and get to the truth.\n\nJust curious how y'all really feel. Thank you and please don't hate me I really want to hear some honest perspectives.",

My boss is actually significantly younger than me (which is an adjustment for my ego, but I think I’m handling it OK - and he definitely knows what his field and is teaching me quite a bit!)\n\nI have enough work experience to recognize that my new boss is well on his way to burnout, and is so ambitious that he’s overreaching by quite a bit and taking on pieces of work that other teams should be working on. He’s volunteering to do a lot of project management with teams because if he doesn’t, the work doesn’t get done as quickly as he’d like. This, by default, means my assigned workload is larger than the scope the role. However, right now when he’s around (not on vacation or work travel) he makes sure that if the workload is over 40 hours that he picks up my slack. When he’s off, and I’m covering for him, my work hours are more like 8am - 6pm just to absorb the most urgent issues. \n\nHe admits he works too much and says he doesn’t expect me to follow suit. Pretty sure he works about 65-75 hours a week. Aside from wanting to protect my work/life balance, I genuinely like him and legitimately worry about him sometimes (like when I see timestamps on emails at 5:30am on a Saturday or hear that he pulled an all nighter on things that IMO really weren’t that urgent.)\n\nHave you worked with a similar boss while managing to maintain your boundaries after the honeymoon period? I’m holding on strong for now but am starting to feel guilty about how much of the work he has to pick up in order for me to maintain my WLB even though, intellectually, I can recognize that the extra work is a direct result of his actions.",

        "text": "As the title states, I'm interested in hearing the opinions of women over 30 on this. I am 30 years old, my boyfriend is also 30. We've been together for 13 years this April, living together for 11. We have no children by choice, we own a home together (both of us are liable for the mortgage), and we have a 12 year old dog and 8 year old cat. Independent finances. We have our disagreements and have been through our fair share of trials, for sure, especially in our early 20s. But overall we have a happy, stable, healthy, loving relationship. And we still have sex 🎉 lol\n\nHere's why I'm posing this question. My boyfriend doesn't believe in marriage. He told me this when we were together for about 6 years, we were about 24 years old. He said it was a choice he made as a child, seeing his own parents' marriage. At the time, I felt like I had to make a choice - if he never changed his mind, if we never got married, do I still want to be with him? And my answer was yes.\n\nFor my side, I did want to get married. Back then, it was more for the party and the dress than for the marriage itself. I admit I wasn't ready or even really worthy of being a wife back then. After letting go of the idea of marriage for awhile, I fell more in love with him. Our connection deepened and we became a very solid couple. Now that I'm 30, the desire to get married is creeping back into my heart. But I can't come up with \"reasons\" as to \"why\". Like I've had 7 years to think about why I want to get married, and aside from \"I love him so much\" and \"I want him to be my husband,\" I got nothin lol. I've talked extensively about this with my therapist and she suggested I make a pros and cons list of getting married vs keeping things the way they are.\n\nI know he would get married if I really pushed the issue. We've talked about it since, I've told him I actually do want to get married and he responded that his feelings had not changed. Also, I want to point out that he also doesn't have any \"reasons\" as to \"why\" either. He simply just made a choice as a child and never revisited the concept, even when he met me and fell in love. So it's also a little hurtful, although I know he loves and adores and needs me, it has been a bit of a mindfuck. But the conversation is open, he's receptive to my thoughts and feelings, and we will need to eventually resolve it.\n\nSo, now that I'm done ranting (this was supposed to be a quick post), what do you think?",

We were different, sure, but those differences were so complementary, it seemed, well, perfect. \n\nNow we didn't live in a fairytale fantasyland, we knew things were going to be hard, he was younger and wanted kids later than me, and I was older and less adventurous and spiritual. We just knew we would figure these things out. We had open communication and that ridiculous, unheard of emotional connection.\n\nWe moved in together and had 6 months of literal bliss. Then a new job came calling, a move to a new city, and his real maturity showed. He did not ask me what I wanted or needed. He did not see the move as an incredibly serious thing. Each day was for living in the moment, not the future, and he did not respond to my needs of more security, of more commitment. He just wanted to be happy. But happiness (in a relationship) is the product of two people's work and when one person wasn't working, it wasn't long-lasting.\n\nThe breakup was swift and he was firm in his decision. I was reeling - how could you be so decisive about ending things when it was so good this entire time? Sure, we were fighting, and sure I've been feeling really insecure lately, and sure I had a panic attack... oh.\n\nWhen I look back on my journal entries from earlier in the year, (yes, our relationship was only one year long), they were panicky scribblings about this person whom I was afraid to love. He dumped all of his romantic expectations on me very early on, telling me how incredibly compatible we were and how a connection like this doesn't come around very often. How we were going to be together for the rest of our lives, but we had only known each other for 2 months! And I fell for it, hook line and sinker. I resisted but to be honest, I wanted to fall in love, and I wanted all the magic, and it was there for a time. We truly were happy. If he were more mature and I had stronger boundaries, we probably could've been together for the long haul. If we had dedicated more time and energy to growth, a new job might not have made our house of cards crumble.\n\nBut it is still what it is. I'm picking up the pieces of my life but I have a sense of satisfaction (it wavers but it's there) that my intuition was right. I let myself fall in love but all along, there were pricklings of doubt, especially when action after action didn't fit the words. \n\nGive the guy a chance, open your heart, be kind to yourself and to others, but trust yourself too. Work on your awareness, stand up for yourself, hold your boundaries firm, and walk when it's time to walk.\n\nI'm still working on it, but it'll get easier every day (or so they tell me).",

        "text": "Last year I took a huge step towards helping my 15 years of fatigue by going on ADHD medication. I started a non-stimulant and my life long anxiety is completely gone. It’s pretty incredible. I also did acupuncture and it shortened my heavy periods from 5-7 days down to 3 days. Also amazing. \n\nThe issue I’m having is that it still seems like I have a hormonal imbalance because despite having more energy than ever, it’s still a lot lower than what feels normal. I quit my job more than a year ago so I have no stress. I’ve always been a healthy eater and cook most meals from scratch. I workout 4 times a week (this is the most my body can handle without becoming drained). I have my phone away 9pm-9am so I’m pretty good with sleep hygiene even though a few times a month I can’t sleep (which is the opposite problem from before medication times where I would sleep 8-10 hours a day and feel groggy). I’ve been in therapy for yearssss and recently cut down because I feel like I’m beating a dead horse continuing to talk about my trauma. I’m over it. I did the work and my life is great. My blood work is always completely normal. I take vitamins and supplements. I’m not a big drinker. Don’t smoke. I live a very healthy life. \n\nI’m beyond frustrated. I feel like I do all the right things but my body is so sensitive. If I spend too many hours in a row socializing, I’m drained for days. If I don’t see anyone, I feel sad and depressed. If I don’t workout, I’m lethargic. If I workout for more than 20 min, I’m also drained (20 min 4x’s a week seems to work best). It’s the worst between ovulation and getting my period. This is when I break out and my emotional regulation sucks. \n\nNo one can give me any answers. My physician is a close friend and did every test imaginable. I’m ready to pull the trigger on an integrative doctor but skeptical when I see things like Dutch test and MTHFR gene on their website. Other doctors would call them quacks and I’d have to shell out thousands of dollars too. What are people supposed to do? I want to get a job again but it feels impossible without consistent energy levels.",

        "text": "I have a friend who I've known for a couple of years. She's been going through a tough time lately -- lost her job, got divorced, got into a new situationship and then that fell apart. When she was dating the new guy after being separated from her husband for a few months (her marriage had been a roommate situation for a while, so I didn't feel like she was jumping from her marriage right into this new relationship), she learned that he's a Taurus. I'm also a Taurus. He was the kind of guy who needed a lot of space and wanted to take things slowly. She was clingy and needed a lot of reassurance and communication throughout the entire time they were talking (3 months). She took it upon herself to read up on how it is to date someone who is a Taurus to explain why he wasn't responding to her in the way she wanted. She would be like \"oh well, Tauruses just need more space,\" \"they're slower burners,\" etc, etc. Whenever she would bring this up to me, I would just casually agree because it seemed harmless at the time. I would try to be supportive and help her understand where he was coming from because I could definitely see that she was being needy really early on into knowing him. I wasn't shocked when he ended things, saying he couldn't give her the energy and attention she was asking for.\n\nAnyways, that ended about a month ago, and she's been taking it hard. She's been really leaning on me for support, and I've done my best to be there for her. Sometimes I need my space from her though because I have my own life/responsibilities/family that take up a lot of my time. I've been practicing drawing more boundaries, not being immediately available if she needs me, and just being honest with her when I need space.\n\nAny time she asks me to hang out and I don't want to, I'll tell her I just need a night to myself to decompress. She follows that up with \"oh yeah, that makes sense, I really understand Tauruses and their need for space.\" If I tell her that I am overwhelmed with my partner's family being in town, she'll say \"of course you are, you're a Taurus! Your home is a sacred space!\" These are just a couple examples, but it's become enough of a pattern that it's started to bother me. Like, I feel like whatever I tell her, she connects it to me being a Taurus.\n\nI don't know if it's something I necessarily need to bring up with her or if I just needed to vent to the internet. But if anyone has any thoughts or advice, all is welcome! Thanks!!",

As co-manager of our organization I gave a 6 week notice of my departure. I'm really struggling with being the resident \"lame duck\". In the beginning I was absolutely heartbroken that I had to leave my job, but now, with 3 weeks left to go I feel like everyday is a struggle and I'm just crawling in my skin. My co-managing partner is an older boomer with limited understanding of technical processes, but very good at being a people person, which is an imperative part of our business. We typically compliment one another quite well and have had a great working relationshiop the past few years we've been together. She's trying to understand what I do (finance, operations, and marketing) but I'm finding it extremely difficult to work with her right now. Her world is so small compared to the world of today and the fast pace of information and technology. For example, we were just charged via our company credit card for a subscription service they have just decided they no longer want to use. The subscription automatically charges out for the next 6 months of service. She is upset that the subscription was charged and wants to now have me call the company and tell them to reverse the charges because we are not going to use it any longer and also to reverse the charges for the previous 6 months because we only used it a couple times. Thats... just not how it works... My reply was that it doesn't work that way, like, for example, I have a gym membership I don't use. I cannot go to the gym and say I want a refund for the previous 6 months becuase I know I've been paying for it and agreed to the terms, but I haven't used it so I'd like a refund. I was doubled down on and told to call the credit card company and file a dispute and tell them to turn off the auto charge from this company. Thats not how any of this works!\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? I feel utterly useless, ganged up on, and that my intelligence is constantly being questioned. The subscription example above is just one of several instances lately. Yesterday was an relatively small issue that could have been easily resolved, but was elevated to the president of our board and opened a huge can of worms that absolutely did not need to be opened. I've had many moments where I just want to toss my personal belongings in my bag and peace out. I know I just need to stick it out and get through the next few weeks, but could use some words of encouragement or anecdotes to get me through this!",

I'll start by saying that I was given a verbal offer for what I'll call \"Established Company\" this week, while \"Fun Company\" is in the final interview process (but looking good). Obviously, nothing is set in stone, but I have been mulling over these two options.\n\nFun Company is a startup in an interesting space. I'd be the first team member of a specific department to be hired. The salary is good, fully remote, equity, and the other founders all have impressive backgrounds—which makes me feel like I'd learn a lot on the job. However, I've worked for startups before, and I know that the work/life balance + overall expectations can be a lot.\n\nEstablished Company is a bank, but it's MY bank and for a product that I use every day. I feel like I'd be contributing to something important. The work might be a bit less exciting/more corporate, but I got good vibes from the team and the management style. The pay is less but still competitive. However, I might need to go into the office once a week, which I don't want to do.\n\nIs there anything major that I'm forgetting to contextualize for my pros and cons list? What do you usually think about when making decisions like this?\n\nThanks!  \n \n\nedit: formatting",

And I honestly think this whole city should be aware of the kind of person he is.\n\nHe's a very \"popular\" guy in that he has a lot of casual friends and tons of social media friends. Someone recently posted him asking for information, but you can't reply anonymously and I don't want my name tied to this in any way, because I know at least one of his good friends is in the group and would definitely tell him.\n\nAnyway, advice and/or perspective is appreciated.\n\nEdited: It's a large but private group. Only women are approved to join. As far as I can tell the only way someone would figure out that I posted anything would be to recognize me as one of the members as well as one of his mutual facebook friends which seems like a lot of work, but it could happen. None of the women who are connected to him in this group know me personally or my relationship to him. ",

        "text": "Hi r/AskWomenOver30, love your whole deal. Would also love any perspective on this pickle.\n\nI have been at my current job for three years. It was my first 40hr/week job after muddling around a bit after college (tutoring, mainly). I started one week before the pandemic. My employer kindly did not fire me. I did get deemed an essential worker (in-office, not public-facing). I, an anxious person, figured my covid risk quota was full up and did not see any of my friends for a year until I was vaccinated. I was also pretty bad at my job for a bit due to being ludicrously depressed and unsupervised.\n\nI love my coworkers. I have a perfectly nice commute. I sometimes enjoy my little tasks. I do not like the deep well of resentment towards my workplace I developed during the first year of COVID, and I do not like that my company pays badly enough that it is essentially subsidized by people living with their parents in a HCOL area, and I do not like that the company is small enough that there's no room to learn anything interesting. \n\nI should look for other jobs for career growth, for new experiences, and for \\[emoji of dollar bill with wings\\]. **But!** I have the huge inconvenient emotional blocks of beliefs that: 1) *every* other full-time job will be just as miserable; 2) If I don't want to keep doing this thing I don't really like, I am definitely not qualified for anything different or more interesting to me. These are very whiny problems, but they sure get in the way of job-hunting. \n\nI will note I've tried and been not so shabby at artistic side hustles. In fact I am currently making the mildly financially stupid choice to do part time at the real job and put more time into the side hustle. Preliminary results are that I like it fine, I'm a lot less burnt out, and I about break even with full time (because the real job's pay is bad!), but it's not particularly scalable and I don't want to put the pressure of my whole life on it. Hence: different real job... maybe.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you find out what you really liked doing, and/or balance it with the material demands of the world? \n\nThanks for reading! Sorry for whining!",

I've expressed my desire for additional responsibilities, more visibility to the company and a promotion.  He agrees the work I'm doing is 1-2 levels higher than my title and comp and I should be doing more and have a different title, but has been making excuses for 5 years why he \"can't\" promote me. He tried replacing me with 5 different external candidates over 13 months, so I could move up, and none of them stuck because the job was too big, too demanding and too much work even for candidates with 20+ years of experience. He brought them all in at a higher comp than I am currently making.  Currently, I am the only person in the company who knows how to do around 40% of my responsibilities. I think this is a major factor in his decision.\n\nHe said I can't get a raise to the market level because I will be making more than my (male) counterparts. I've been in my role for 8 years. Does a lateral move for higher comp at a different company make sense? Nearly every current ad for my same title at similar size companies is paying 15-20% more than what I'm making.\n\nOr should I hold out for a different title even if it means staying at the company for 6-12+ more months? Not sure if that contradicts my desire to continue growing in my career. I'm frustrated because I've been in my position 3 years longer than I wanted and I'm not progressing as I should. I'm a Mid 30s Corporate Manager for a 2 Billion dollar company. If I stay in my role at this company any longer, I dread that I will never get out. Internal or external. I will go crazy if I'm doing this work for the next 30 years.\n\nAs a hiring Manager, I would see it as a red flag that the current company isn't promoting the employee applying. I don't know how to professionally say I'm being blocked by my Manager.\n\nHas anyone else ever experienced something similar?",

Slim but curvy, very pretty face, and I’d see mens eyes light up when I’d walk by or smile at them or whatever. People routinely described me as a 10. I’m aware that sounds REALLY arrogant, but that was just the facts of my existence aged 12-29. Due to health issues I’ve gained a LOT of weight in the past several years. I gained weight slowly at first and still got a lot of attention when I was 30-40 pounds up. Then I suddenly gained another 30+ pounds very quickly in the space of a year. So I’m now 60-70 lb up. Though only about 30 from my “still hot” weight. A lot of this weight is around my middle and on my face, drowning out my features. Meanwhile, I’ve started getting weird growths that look like keloid acne scars all over my face, even though I’ve always had very clear skin. I have no idea what they are or how to stop them coming. My skin had dried up and aged. The nature of my i health issues means it’s not at all easy lose weight. In the span of about 2 years I went from a “desirable commodity” to invisible to the world and I cannot remember the last time anyone looked at me that. I haven’t cared at all until now, actually I’ve found it all quite freeing as that stuff is shallow. But I am suddenly hit with the reality that I’m “ugly” now and I can’t help feeling repulsed by what I see in the mirror and sad that I don’t get to have those warm interactions anymore from someone who’s actually excited to talk to me.

He’s emotionally available and open. he is openly affectionate. Before him, I had a series of “unrequited” loves and situationships with emotionally unavailable, “nonchalant” men. He treats me better than anyone else has ever treated me and consistently makes me a priority through his actions. Part of me wonders if the thrill of the chase and uncertainty of the unknown that was common in my previous (non)relationships is what I’m missing. I’m not sure. \n\nHe is also more of a street-smart, blue-collar kinda guy, while my type is usually the quiet, mysterious, intellectual type. I do sometimes wish we could connect more on an intellectual level, but it’s not something that I really need in my romantic relationship, as I have plenty conversations of this kind with colleagues and friends. \n\nI’m just not sure.

I love him, and I feel loved, but I don’t have that feeling of “holy shit you’re my soulmate” kind of feeling. And it’s not like I’m not the type to feel that way. I am a hopeless romantic.

We got close fast, I supported her through her aunt's death and she supported me through some surgeries I was having.  The support was chatting and encouragement, sometimes I'd stay up late in the night to talk and she'd do the same for me.\n\nShe had some serious health issues and ended up in the hospital for a week.

Our messaging dropped down to once or twice a week while she got her strength back, which was understandable.\n\nWe continued being friends like that for another couple of months until one day she disappeared again. I assumed her health had deteriorated and assumed she was in the hospital again.\n\nI sent a message full of good wishes for her and expected she would see it when she got out of hospital. I sent another message telling her I hope she is ok and recovering well about 2 weeks later.\n\nI did not get responses. The weeks went by and turned into months.

By this point I was starting to assume that her health complications had gotten so bad that she was either extremely ill, or had in fact died.\n\nI sent her a \"happy birthday\" message in November, believing that if she had been sick, that when she recovers she would see my message and know that I had been here for her and still cared about her.\n\n6 months went by in total that I did not hear from her. At that point I assumed she had died and I began to grieve the loss of her and the friendship. I thought about her a lot and spent a lot of time crying and processing the grief. It was a difficult time for me.\n\nOn Christmas Day I sent one last message, just a simple \"merry Christmas\" more into the abyss for my own sake as i honestly thought she was gone. Well, she replied.\n\nTurns out she hadn't been sick at all like I thought, she had been travelling around Europe with her relatives. I was simultaneously elated that she was ok, stunned that she was well enough for a trip like that, and deeply hurt that she had essentially ghosted me for 6 months and that I had been through so much emotional pain.\n\nShe said she didn't have service on her phone while travelling all those months and she did apologise vaguely. I know she probably didn't mean to hurt me, but she did. \n\nNow she wants to be in my life again, she's been messaging me and saying how much I mean to her and how glad she is to be talking again. And I'm so conflicted  because I should be forgiving and let go of what happened but I'm also hurt that she treated me the way she did. To my mind, if someone cares about me they wouldn't ghost me, especially after a time in intensive care for major health issues which led me to believe she had gone back into intensive care and died.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I let it be water under the bridge and try to welcome her with warmth? Or am I being a pushover? If i end the friendship at this point is that too harsh?\n\nI've been a bit of a pushover at times, and I wonder if I'm being one now. How would you handle this situation? Any advice? I'm open to hearing any feedback!",

        "text": "I (33F) have always been super close with my family. They are the most important connections in my life next to my partner, and I've been struggling a lot lately with living away from them, especially as my parents get older (in their late 60s). If I liked my hometown I'd move to be close to them in a heartbeat, but unfortunately I'm from a remote town with little/no job prospects and not many likeminded potential friends/community. I talk to my parents several times a week on the phone and visit as often as is realistic (3-4 times a year), but it hurts a lot to be missing out on spending time with them. Every time I hear about my siblings joining them for dinner or doing stuff together I feel so sad and left out. I would kill to be able to swing by their house for a random hello or invite them over for dinner. I feel preemptively regretful, like I know that once they're not here anymore I'll regret that I didn't spend this time with them. They're at an age now where some of their friends are having health troubles and dying, and the thought of that happening without more quality time first is absolutely crushing. I also feel my connection with my siblings slipping away as we all live busy lives and don't have as much time to catch up, which hurts a lot too as we used to be super close. I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here, but I'm really struggling to combat these feelings of deep sadness and separation. It keeps me up at night. I guess maybe just wondering if anyone has been in my shoes, and how you managed to come to terms with things or find ways to feel more connected from afar?",

        "text": "I have been dating a man 33 for seven months. I’m 38 years old, I’m a single mother of four. We had been dating a month or so and he brought up the conversation about us being boyfriend and girlfriend, he kept saying it. We both deleted bumble. A few weeks later I saw a badoo notification come up on his phone. I flipped and he started crying and saying he was sorry and it was a mistake. He showed me the app and there was nobody on it. From that moment on I have been assuming he’s been cheating on me. My ex husband of 16 years cheated on me, up until I noticed the message I knew that I couldn’t think everyone was cheating on me and everyone had a clean slate. He’s always followed instagram women but I’m now overthinking that. I’m constantly checking to see when he was online if his followers have gone up or down, I’ve become obsessed. Again till that point I wasn’t bothered. I spoke to him and he deleted about 50 of them. The last few days he’s added a few more and my head has gone again. I’m even spying on his snap score which has gone up a lot the last few days. He’s finally met my kids, they love him and he seems to adore them and he’s wonderful with my kids. He’s sweet and attentive towards me. He works away and every time he’s away my head is all over the place. I also suffer with anxiety and ocd. I didn’t date anyone for over two years so I could try and heal. He stayed with us all over Christmas, my ex sent me some horrible emails that upset me and I was in a mess. I begged him to never do that to me, just tell me outright. He knows that I was in a very abusive relationship and was cheated on, he has also seen his sister been cheated on and has seen the damage that caused her and her children, could a man who has seen so much pain want to cheat? He always talks about the future and when I talk about the kids he says, “ how can we help them” or how will we deal with this when they are older” like he wants and knows we will be together for a long time. He’s even spoken about getting a mortgage( a long way off yet) but we have spoken about it. He stayed with us for five days last week and where I was overthinking one morning I blurted out “ I can’t do this anymore” he was actually awake and heard this, he started to panic and he kept asking me over and over again what I meant by that. I just said” the kids are being noisy and arguing” my head calmed down and so did my insecurities and we had a good week. \n\nAnyway, do you think I’m overthinking ? I have been cheated on, have ocd and know that I am a massive over thinker. I hate that he looks at instagram women. I know what I’m worth but it still bothers me, am I being insecure ? Was what he did a genuine one off mistake? I don’t want to loose a good thing but my intuition is screaming at me but I will ruin this if I don’t get a grip of myself.",

No reason given. We had been in an up-and-coming band together, and suddenly that was also lost to me. I had heard rumors of him immediately being with someone else, but this was never confirmed, so I've always wondered if he cheated. To say it completely wrecked me would be putting it mildly. I moved thousands of miles away for the next decade, but recently returned home and heard this dude is still here, still playing in bands, apparently very open about being in therapy and being a mental health advocate...so, I sent him a message. It was brief and asked if he's capable of providing insight or closure. \n\nNow I'm wondering if this was a dramatic move after all this time?",
