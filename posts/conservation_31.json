It's a web/mobile app to help inform what environmental/social certificates are in actuality. I think there are a lot of people who wish to buy something that is more environmentally friendly, but are sometimes disenfranchised by the flood of information involved in certificates. There are a lot of companies that get away with greenwashing, and I believe they do this through the aforementioned complexity. The project goal is to quantify, simplify, and source these certificates. \n\nI've developed a mobile app to go along with this project, which uses image recognition. The mobile app is to allow users to use their camera to scan an environmental or social certificate, and give quantified information about that certificate. \n\n\nI've also tried to develop an area for the web app to help facilitate community with this project. It allows users to submit suggestions/contributions towards this project. The contributions are to be verified, and then added to the mobile app. I haven't been sure where to share this, as I don't have a presence on the blogosphere. Any questions/suggestions are welcome :)\n\n\n\n[Web App](https://querychain.com)\n\n[Mobile App Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otOH1zLfPX8)\n\n[Facebook (for project updates)](https://www.facebook.com/querychain/)",

Apperantly \"mustang\" is a collective name for wild/feral horses in the US and not a breed itself, wich I wasn't sure of earlier. A lot of people think the goverment ([BLM] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bureau_of_Land_Management_Herd_Management_Areas)) is handeling the horses poorly, or want them extinct. And the BLM say they need to bring the population down quite a bit because they are so many and they compete over grasing lands with ranchers cattle way to much.\n\nWhat comes to mind for me is that the horses has only been a part of the americas for 500 years, wich they also mention and that really is nothing if you're looking at the grand scale of things. So they don't really have a natural role in the nature there. Set the humans interests aside. Would it really be that bad if the were extinct? Sure it would be a tremendous amount of work since the population apperantly is so strong.\n\nHow are the horses treating the ecosystem compered to the bison? I suppose they should have a similar role in nature there, since both beeing big grasers and I guess they can live in similar types of nature.\n\nI can really recomend the documentary itself if you are into nature and/or horses. The north american nature is just stunning.",
