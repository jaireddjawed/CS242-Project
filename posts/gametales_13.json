There they started a bar fight and boldly murdered two Redbrands, ruined the bar, and started a manhunt for their heads. Then started a fire to sneak to the mansion where the rogue went ahead and got magically coerced into helping Glasstaff. The rogue almost killed the whole party while apologizing profusely, as the whole town burned down and the bad guy made his escape. \n\nThe party narrowly survived and decided it was best to find an inn in another town and never speak of Phandalin again. On the bright side the entire party has a lot of great emotional baggage to take on the next adventure. ",

        "text": "This is a tale of six friends who know nothing of warhammer that tries to be an elite group of acolytes for an Inquisitor named Maris. With extremely limited knowledge and more flight instincts than brains we fumble our way through this grim dark adventure. We just arrived on Spectoris (or what our GM called \"Tutorial Island\") our rag tag squad smelled dead fish looked at beaches and got yelled at by a mob and then decided to call it a day.\n\nThe only to people to wake up during the night was Elana and Diona, from their view of their pods was fire billowing up as the block they were in was quickly becoming a roaring fire. The first of the two to wake up was Diona, growing up on a feral world had a funny way of always keeping you on your toes espically while sleeping. Immediately noticing the building next to her was nothing more than a tornado of flame she fought the urge to just break the pod and start climbing, she pushed her recall button to get slowly lowered down to the ground. Sprinting up to the robot \"Hey there's aÂ huge fire get everyone down it's an emergency!\" In a synthetic voice \"I can only enitiate evacuation protocol with proper identification.\" \"You gotta be kidding me!\"\n\nBy this time Elana had awoken due to smoke seeping into the cracks of her pod, seeing the fire Elana repeatedly presses the recall button until she is safely on the ground and rushes up to Diona. \"This stupid machine won't evacuate everyone!\" \"I can only enitiate evacuation protocol with proper identification.\" \"Yeah I heard you the first time.\" Sudden unintelligebile yelling started coming from behind them Elana grabed at her sawed off while turning around to see about three cloaked figures chucking molotoves at and into the wire frame building. As the wooden flooring starts to catch Elana turns around to plead with the machine \"Were all are going to die if -\" Diona jumps outta no where body slams the poor machine onto the floor with a battle cry \"Help me with this!\" Elana takes aim at the robot and fires... Hitting Diona straight in the back (with righteous fury mind you) \"WHAT THE HELL?\" \"OH BY THE EMPORER I'M SORRY!\" The robot still being pinned can't really do much but Diona could swear she heard a robotic wheezing that sounds a lot like laughing. \"Just get the others down and put your gun on safety would ya?!\" Tearing the robotic skull from its body Diona assumes this is enough to kill the machine since it turned off.\n\nThere was only one Rodrick in the directory and quickly brought him down and caught him up to speed while Diona sits by the robot to make sure it's not just playing dead and trying to put some bandages on the fresh bullet holes in her back. Frantically searching through the data-base Elana realizes that with three Lugs she may as well drop all three, the first two pods dropped held fisherman who immediately ran for the door only to catch on fire and become immolated making screaming the whole time. Lug practically falls out of his pod half asleep \"I was having the best dream of me life why'd you go and ruin it?\" \"Next time I'll let you fall to a fiery death then Lug!\" \"You don't gotta be li-\" \"Alright both of you enough! What are we going to do about the fire that is surrounding us?!\" \"It's about to the desk so we can't go up or through it...\" \"So we go down!\" Triumphant eyes beaming with pride as she looked at us three \"Ok good idea Diona but, how do we DO that?\" Between the fire and the squabbling it came as a surprise as Rodrick gave Diona a sledge hammer while simply saying \"Have fun.\"\n\nHolding her newly acquired sledge she raised it high into the air with only one mighty swing the already weak wood gave way suggesting there's a chance this'll work. So with a deep breath Diona took another big swing and created an opening, Rodrick not realizing how close he had been and underestimating her might fell in and was the first to check if it was safe. All they could hear was a lot of swearing and something about why it always had to be the face and decided it probably was safer than trying to run through an ever growing fire. One by one they dropped into the hole until it came to Lug who tripped on a wire from the robot forcing him to fall head first into the platform then to continue falling. He definitely cracked a rib or two on the second platform, we opted for the slower safer way with the ladder to get down to him. \n\nAfter we were able to messily patch him up we pressed on into this tunnel, it became increasingly clear that it is a maintenance area and we probably should get out as quickly as possible. Diona takes point weaving us down windy paths seeming to pick which tunnel to go down next at random. Finally after wasting more than half of Lugs batter life on his data-slate, which he wouldn't stop reminding us of, we reached something other than just more options of paths to go down. \"Why is there oil all over the pla-\" \"Shh!\" Diona signals to get low we so all listen for a time and finally hear what she's hearing, a synthesized wheezing \"Should we proceed?\" Diona shooting us a distressing look. \n\n\"He might know the way out so I say why not?\" Lug heads forward so we all follow the scribe. Pointing his handy dsta-slate towards the floor we are greeted with the sight of a torn apart tech priest. \"Woah it looks like it was done by hand? I don't even see any clean cuts or bullet holes?\" Diona the ever empathetic goes immediately for the tech priests necklace and pocketing it \"I can't see anything ahead except for more oil and blood guys.\" \"Well do we want to go back or continue on?\" \"Listen there might be whatever that did this up ahead I'm not that stupid to charge into death.\" \"Oh throne don't be such a coward Lug.\" \"That's easy to say for a guardswoman!\" \"He does have a point Diona.\" \"Weren't you an arbite? I'm surprised you're taking his side.\" \"There's just no reason to...\"\n\nEverybody stopped as we all listened in terror, a warning messaged boomed through the over head speakerphones. \"Any and all personnel evacuate for depressurization.\"\n\nTL:DR Our first combat, if you can call it that, consisted of a feral guardswoman body slamming a robot to be immediately shot in the back by a friendly with righteous fury no less and then Lug taking MORE damage falling rather than the shotgun blast. We are terrible at warhammer.l Also I can't help but feel these are too short should I make them longer?",

        "text": "For a little back ground we have a GM that is well versed at being a GM and in the warhammer 40k lore, as for the group however there is myself and five others. We have never heard of warhammer before we met our GM and we all liked the idea of a grim dark rpg. Having only played pathfinder about ten sessions in total which ended in tpk twice due to our cleric not wanting to be a cleric, but that is another tale for another time, we all created our characters for first edition. Our party consisting of Rodrick the sanctioned psyker, Sham as scum, Elana an arbite, Diona a guards woman, and two adepts by the names of Lug and Alaric. So our GM briefly went over the universe and where we were in the galaxy he turned his gaze to look at us all and said with glee \"Good luck.\"\n\nChapter 1: Tutorial Island\n              It was a dimly lit tiny room slightly packed with four people who had distrust in their eyes, Lug breaking the silence \"So ah, you all here for the inquisition as well?\" While most of the rest of us were stunned by being so open about our situation the feral guardswoman Diona unfazed by this \"Yeah that's why I'm here as well.\" Elana and Rodrick nod in agreement as the group starts to hear a faint clattering in the ventilation system over head. Everyone carefully starts to get their weapons ready, as a circular orb drops out of the vent and hits the floor. Everybody quickly realizes the door behind them is starting to close, Rodrick having seen too many claustrophobic areas and the dangers therein tried to leave before it shuts but the older guy just staggers forward bashing his nose on the metal door as it closes. Lug being himself walks up the orb and pokes it with his staff, lights start coming from the orb as it lifts off the ground and begins to show a hologram above it.  \n         \"Hello acolytes.\" In a stern voice, \"I am inquisitor Maris, right now you are on a flight to Spectoris their tithe within the past years has decreased fifteen percent. I want you to go to Spectoris find the reason behind this and rectify the situation. Understood?\" \"Do we have any starting leads to make this investigation any easier?\" Asked Elana \"Yes one person you could look into is a Moira Cullen. The Imperium elected her leader as the planet squabbled  amongst themselves.\" Lug stepping forward \"What are the rules of engagement?\" \"Engage as you see fit but do not be mistaken you have no help, if you become an enemy of the state and get locked up you still tour there.\" Rodrick finally up as he rubs his nose \"What is their tithe?\" \"Their main export is fish, this planet it ninety-five percent water with only one inhabited city.\" Everyone looking at each other waiting to see if anybody else had questions, after a bit of an awkward silence \"You are operating under me and for the inquisition I will be watching.\" \"How will we reach you when we complete our mission objective?\" \"I will contact the group Elana.\" And with that the orb stopped emitting light from it and floated back up and away into the airducks, the team staring at each other with the task set in front out them they mulled about for a time Rodrick and Lug playing cards Elana taking a nap and Diona checking her guns and cleaning her swords. \n      Finally the gravity shift shook everyone suggesting they were going to land soon so the team wandered to the docking area and took their first few steps onto Spectoris. The first thing to hit you was the smell of putrid dead fish and the Sewer exhausts, the sight was a lot more inviting however, beach as far as the eye can see and a clear sky with the sun starting to drop back down to the horizon. \"I say we let the arbite lead since the she is the only one who has done any sort of investigations I'm assuming.\" \"Fair enough Rodrick.\" So Elana led our team towards the heart of the city. There wasn't much to look at while walking, it was mostly boats the fisherman and fish. There were a few industrial buildings but not many, a growing sound was catching or attention more than anything else at the moment though.\n           The sound became clear as we rounded the last corner towards the noise as a group of people yelling indiscriminately at anyone passing by about porters and how all of it is unfair, Elana being the only one wanting to approach an angry mob decided she wanted some answers. She approached the closest man to her \"What is your name?\" \"Dirk.\" \"So what are you protesting?\" After a long glare Dirk leans forward and seethes through his teeth \"What are ya, a FUCKIN PORTER?\" At this the whole mob stopped yelling at people walking by they turned their collective attention all on Elana. Rodrick slides up to Elana putting a hand on her shoulder nudingly suggesting that we should go, Elana glared back but knew it was better to just move along. \"Maybe we should just find a place to sleep yeah?\" Diona points to a structure that has hundreds of sleeping pods so we head out to catch up on some sleep. Upon arrival we're greeted by a robot hooked to the reception desk, it points to unused pods after it takes some of our thrones of course. Lug was the first one in a pod followed by Rodrick then Elana and Diona. \n         The only two people to wake up during the night was Elana and Diona and from their view in the pod was fire billowing up as the block they were in was quickly becoming a roaring fire.\n\nEnd of part 1 \n       \n        TL:DR First post on here so I'm pretty bad at writing this, it's slow going at the start but it kicks up I promise.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6eo0pg/battletech_the_1st_vikings_beat_the_oddsagain/",
        "text": "So it has, within our group, been no secret for a few months now that our DM is trying to find ways to curb our runaway success. Due to the nature of battletech the harder he hits us the stronger it makes us if we can come out in one piece, and we've basically snowballed past the point where salvaging another assault really means anything to us.\n\nHis last plan involved throwing us into a dense jungle with an ace CQC mech, and this week's plot involved sending us on a \"recon\" mission (so we'd leave the assault lance at home) and throwing a full company at us to force a bloodied retreat. Ironically it worked out pretty well until we realized that we were in a bad spot retreat or no.\n\nSo per our plan to run a mostly pursuit force, as we were led to believe we would be hunting down an unidentified recon group, we packed light, with only two mechs over 60 tons, and both being jump capable. The exact force consisting of;\n\n* Storm, our heavily modified and frankly terrifying Longbow missile artillery mech, the biggest and most unwieldy mech we brought by far, but also the longest ranged with 4 LRM15s\n* Lasher, a heavily modified Firefly tooled for harassment and mobility with medium lasers, small pulse lasers, and double heat sinks\n* Musketeer, ironically the fastest mech we brought, Musketeer was an extremely heavily modified Rifleman sporting a massive XL engine, twin batteries of medium lasers, jump jets and enough double heat sinks to chase and fire with impunity\n* A lightly modified Grasshopper equipped with a PPC and some medium lasers\n* Heresy, a modified Grand Dragon carrying a trio of medium lasers and a rare large pulse laser\n* Wyrm, a lightly modified Scorpion that trades the SRM6 for an LRM5\n* Hundun, a modified Centurion that carries an LBX autocannon and a battery of medium lasers\n\nWe arrive and find exactly what we had been expecting, an under-strength scout lance of a Shadow Hawk, Jenner, and Wasp. We quickly close the gap and engage the Wasp and Jenner, within 30 seconds both mechs are reeling from a withering barrage of lasers coming out of Musketeer, Heresy, and Lasher. It was at that precise moment that things really fell apart for the scouts though, the Wasp decided to be a hero, leaping into the air and flinging itself towards Lasher, where it was used as a clay pigeon by Hundun, Lasher, and Heresy, meanwhile the Jenner stubbornly stood its ground, getting a slight reprieve as Storm's supportive fire shifts to fresh enemy reinforcements.\n\nPlot twist, we've seen these guys before, it's the 8th Sword of Light! We \"unofficially\" clashed with them on Alshain after they decided they wanted to make enemies of us, and now they're here to pay us back. Banter is exchanged and we all prepare for a very satisfying win as another round of fighting passes by with the Jenner's leg being swept out from under it and the pilot slipping into unconsciousness and a barrage of missiles from Storm pelting the unfortunate Griffin.\n\nIt was at this point that things started to go slightly awry for **us.** Musketeer, against Storm's protests, decides to start a firewall and create some smoke cover, while Lasher becomes increasingly bold, maneuvering well into the enemy formation, confident in the fact that nothing has actually hit it yet. Then Lasher jumps directly into the enemy formation and spends a round being kicked from all sides by enemies on the high ground, resulting in one arm flying out of its socket and the other very nearly following suit as the poor Firefly tumbles to the ground in a very bad spot.\n\nAround this time yet another lance of enemies arrives, a pair of very skilled mechwarriors and another heavy mech are now on the field, while Lasher and Heresy are becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of armor they are losing. Lasher attempts to beat a hasty retreat but is nearly cut in half by an enemy Centurion, its pilot makes a note to kill the Centurion later, meanwhile the Storm and Musketeer continue to slowly rip apart the enemy Grand Dragon and Phoenix hawk, stripping vast chunks of armor and crippling internal components with every passing second.\n\nNow from our point of view this is looking bad but could still go either way, the Jenner loses its other leg and the Phoenix Hawk's pilot blacks out, but in return Lasher's leg is seared open by a large laser and we all glance at the pilot stats of the Whitworth that just arrived with horror. Our decision is cemented when a battalion command lance wanders into the AO on the next turn, with a very angry Battlemaster at the helm, the order comes out to turn what was a slow withdrawal into a proper fighting retreat. Intense winds have turned Musketeer's firewall into massive clouds of smoke that have scattered in all directions, segmenting the battlefield horribly, but giving us the excellent opportunity to spend a turn collectively wailing on the enemy Centurion.\n\nDespite the order to retreat we are remaining pretty confident, and our rate of withdrawal is mostly being dictated by the enemy's rate of advance, rather than actually pull back Musketeer spends a turn to end the Centurion's misery while Lasher shifts along the line to engage the enemy Champion now pushing towards Wyrm and our Grasshopper, meanwhile Storm has not moved an inch for over a minute now, still spitting out barrage after barrage of missiles stripping armor and components from enemies.\n\nIt dawns on us that there's really no reason for the enemy to allows us to kite them like this, they're being recklessly aggressive, in fact their Griffin is currently grossly overextended into our lines. This being a grudge match to them their tactics seem to be a bit lacking, which is only confirmed as the fourth mech of their command lance wanders into the AO far behind its companions. A quick ammo explosion later and the Griffin has been removed from the field of battle, despite having a force twice the size and strength of ours the Sworders have been reduced to 70% effectiveness without even a single kill, and the stream of swearing and epithets that occasionally bleeds into open comms confirms that they are aware of this fact. Unfortunately (for the sworders) as their Panther falls to pieces and the still unconscious Phoenix Hawk is finally put out of its misery, we remark on how well the operation is going right before we notice some fire coming out of the Champion's side torso a split second before the whole thing erupts into a fireball, within the blink of an eye a chain reaction of ammo detonations brought on by the Sworder's reckless disregard for positioning or heat management rips the 60 ton heavy mech into so much shrapnel without us having to lift a finger.\n\nAt this point we've had our fun, and start to actually withdraw in earnest, Hundun and Wyrm are already clear, and Heresy is too far out afield to contribute to the actual fight any longer. At least we were supposed to withdraw, a sudden gyro hit sent the enemy Whitworth tumbling into the dirt. Sensing blood in the water our remaining lance of mechs quickly reversed course to descend on the stricken mech, gouging out what remains of its gyro and forcing an ejection.\n\nContent in this kill we resume our efforts to escape, paying no mind to the Battlemaster that is now moving to cut off our escape, that is until a PPC from said Battlemaster decapitates Lasher. It's fight or flight now, Storm is out of missiles, Musketeer and the Grasshopper are both running out of armor, and there are still a lot of mechs in the field with very skilled pilots, but Lasher is loaded with irreplaceable Lostech that can only be recovered if the Sworders are routed. The decision is made for us when the Battlemaster continues to barrel towards our position though, taking a turn to set a number of defensive fires the Battlemaster readily overextends, paying no mind to the steadily thickening smokescreen cutting it off from the rest of its lance. \n\nNow the Battlemaster is a very scary mech, and with an ace pilot at the helm it's easily the biggest threat on the battlefield, but even so 1 versus 3 is not good odds, and so we spend the next 30 seconds locked in a fight to the death with the Battlemaster, narrowly dodging barely coordinated supporting fire from its lance before our luck returns and a barrage of lasers melts open the Battlemaster's cockpit, triggering the autoeject and decapitating the entire enemy force.\n\nWith 66% of their original force, including the battalion commander, now lying in the dirt, the remaining enemies decide that they have no real option but to withdraw and regroup, leaving the battered Vikings to tend to Lasher and its critically injured pilot.\n\nInterestingly after they regrouped, the Sworders quickly realized that they no longer could muster the forces to assault the Vikings' base, a simple counter-recon operation had completely neutered their invasion force. Having violated the territory of a sovereign nation, and an allied nation at that, in pursuit of a personal grudge, the Sworders were forced to withdraw empty handed and with their tails between their legs.\n\nWe began to congratulate each other on our victory and pondered if any of the newly salvaged mechs were worth using. Then our DM called us a bunch of bastards, threw out the entire planetary defense arc he had planned, and informed us that after that disgraceful display the entire Sword of Light battalion we fought was temporarily disbanded and its former members dispossessed, either going on to commit ritual suicide or be seek post-trauma therapy.",

        "text": "So my last tale was the one about our barbarian who I convinced had managed to conceive a child with a dragon, and it went down beautifully! This next story is from the same group of players, albeit earlier in the campaign, before any dragons had been encountered. \n\nThe relevant characters are:\n\nLord Boopy,  the human paladin.\n\nPiggy, the bard, who was a chipmunk at this point in time (a story for another day)\n\nTorgga Frostbeard, the dwarven barbarian\n\nVollendrick, the human ranger\n\nThe tale begins when the group arrives in a town after a shipwreck. The Rouge and rangers, actually being the only ones who wanted to get back on the plot, went to gather information on a local duke and the wizard is bartering with merchants for several enchanted items. The half-orc fighter, the barbarian, and the bard head to the tavern, and the paladin goes to investigate the local church (read: cultist temple)\n\nThe chipmunk bard finds a female chipmunk in the tavern (by way of a natural 20 investigation for females), who he seduces, only for the two of them to walk in on the paladin fighting some cultists. Once the cultists are dead, the barbarian and ranger wander over, and these four (plus lady chipmunk) enter the crypts below the temple. \n\nIn these crypts there is a pitfall trap. The barbarian notices a switch, but doesn't even investigate to see what it does, just goes straight for a chest, and lo and behold - pitfall. The paladin goes to help him (he has some rope), crit fails his strength check and ends up in the pit too.\n\nEventually, the ranger hears their calls for help and the paladin throws him the rope to pull them out. This, luckily, succeeds. Once the are out of the pit they discuss how to cross the pit STILL IGNORING THE SWITCH which is practically labelled 'deactivate trap/close pit'.\n\nThe paladin is convinced there was a lumberjack in town who will sell them wood. He goes and after a few failed persuasion checks ends up paying double the price for four planks of wood that are 15ft long. They then proceed to cart these down into the crypts, construct a makeshift bridge, and cross the pit. \n\nAt this point I inform the players that they could have just hit the switch. \n\nThey facepalm, some laughs are had. The barbarian says (out of character) \"oh well, at least we got loot!\" And goes to open the chest. \n\nIt's a mimic. ",

        "text": "This is from the same Firefly-esque Alternity campaign as [The Tale of Nisei Wafu](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6949vk/the_tale_of_nisei_wafu_alternity/), and occurs relatively early in the gameâs timeline, well before that event.\n\nThe GM had asked us extensive questions prior to starting the campaign about what we wanted from the tone of the game. We basically answered by positing a halfway point between Star Wars and Firefly. We wanted to be pulpy heroes, but we werenât opposed to bad things happening or us not being paragons of virtue or winning most of the time. With this understanding the GM went on to craft the gameâs plot and background, and also had all of us roll on a d44 table to determine what relationships we had had formed with each other over the last few years of working together on a starship.\n\nThis had the immediate and hilarious effect of generating additional NPCâs and character growth for much of the party as âYou are in a relationship with another crew memberâs siblingâ was rolled up multiple times. We also got âyou have saved a crew memberâs lifeâ âyou have loaned money to a crew memberâ and âyou have helped the ship out of a significant jam.â Thankfully, nobody rolled up âyou are dating another crew member.â This left us with a fair amount of backstory and dispositions toward other crew right from the start, and worked fantastically well for building noodle incidents and other banter between characters.\n\nThe four characters who matter for the purposes of this story are as follows:\n\n* Captain Hannah - Actually male, everyone assumes from his advertising and name that the captain is female, and that he is some kind of spacehand or second mate. Anger issues. In extreme debt. Is dating Winterâs sister.\n\n* Gunnar the Spacehand - 8 foot tall musclebound mutant with a crippling fear of bodies of open or deep water. Captain saved his life, he has made significant sacrifice to keep the boat running. Only managed to roll backstory that connects him to the captain, not anyone else. Functions as the ship's loadlifter. \n\n* Winter the Weaboo Ninja-Hacker - heâs not a ninja, heâs a spoiled rich kid with a hard-on for Japanese culture and and a lot of fancy toys, but heâs useful as a computer tech and does our advertising. Secretly has really poor health. Has loaned money to the Captain.\n\n* Dirk the Big Game Hunter - Rich ârealityâ TV star, and is a bit like if you crossed Steve Irwin with Indiana Jones and added a large dollop of your typical Great White Hunter. Dirk is dating the Captainâs more successful sister who owns a shipping company.\n\nAlso in the cast, but relatively unimportant for this portion are:\n\n* Kat the Catgirl Engineer. Oversexed and not pursued by any crew members, on the run from some kind of trouble on Earth, the captain taking her on helped her out of a major jam. Is used as a model in Winter's adverts, and is thus constantly assumed to be Capt. Hannah.\n\n* Dok the Former Merc: She actually has an M.D. Also a prosthetic leg, and some sunk investment in helping keep the boat running. \n\nNow, just like Firefly, we have a few wacky but thrilling adventures, but then we hit our âReaverâ episode and the universe is revealed to not be all fun adventure. Thereâs a species out there that causes you to lock up in complete paralyzing fear if you get too close to them, and they have a penchant for showing up at remote colonies or research stations and leaving them completely empty. Their existence is not a secret, but the knowledge is not widespread or well-documented. Our crew is *terrified* of them.\n\nShortly after this, there is a very public, multi-pronged attack by these aliens, Winter's mother is threatened, and we go in to rescue her personally, while running into some friendly forces wearing the logos of a corp we're on good terms with. Unfortunately, after rescuing Winter's mother, we realize the corp squad is not standard corp security, but a black-ops heavy threat team who proceed to sanitize the area by mowing down civilians with gunfire. We don't manage to stop the attack, we don't manage to stop the massacre, and our 'heroes' walk away at the end of the day with the dubious honor of having saved a family member at the cost of a couple hundred people. \n\nOn flying out of the system, the news does not get any better.  Communications are patchy, but all indications are that Dirkâs family was in a place that got hit hard and have been killed, and the fate of the Captainâs sister is uncertain as she was in another location that has had a comm blackout and it's uncertain if they were hit. Dirk is in a deep, dark place, and Winter, the man with all the verbal finesse of your typical fumbling otaku, takes Dirk aside in private and tries to console him with repeated fortune cookie platitudes. While none work, he does keep trying for some time. The last of these that he tosses out before leaving is âAt least theyâre in a better place now.â\n\nDirkâs player had teared up a little over whatâs been going down, looks kind of shocked but then looks around the table sadly and tells us âWell shit. Thereâs really only one thing my character would do now.â\n\nThe some of the crew see Winter exit Dirkâs quarters, and then a few minutes later, a gunshot echoes in the hallways of the ship. The characters AND players all react with various amounts of shock.\n\nThe GM and most of us stare dumbfoundedly at Dirkâs player\n\nâYou donât tell profoundly depressed people that their dead loved ones are in a better place than they are,â he says as he shakes his head at Winterâs player.\n\nWinterâs player responds with a bunch of sputtering that heâs just a guy trying to help a friend out, and WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THAT?\n\nâWhat the FUCK?!â vents the GM. This is his *fucking* bugbear, because when he was setting the tone for the campaign, he went out of his way to ask us about tone. He got his answer and was of the understanding that we were all on-board to be pulp action heroes. Goddamnit, suicide is not on the action list for pulp heroes. Big damn heroes donât kill themselves unless itâs as a blaze of glory against oncoming enemies, or a noble sacrifice to save the other heroes. This also fucks with the whole 'you have connections to other characters' part of his chargen process, since you can't just replace a character and say they were on the ship the whole time.\n\nThe other players say nothing, but largely have looks on their faces that say âFuck. This is a little too real and depressing.â The fun has begun to leak out of the game. \n\nThe rest of the session is trying to deal with the aftermath of Dirkâs death, arranging his funeral, finally managing to get in contact with the Captainâs sister and giving her the bad news, and all the very unpleasant realities of dealing with the death of a friend. It is very much **not** fun, and as it drags on, the rest of the party is more and more convinced that this campaign is now over. The GM is belaboring on the party and on Dirkâs player, who is still at the table, how terrible a decision this was. The fun is not merely leaking, it has vanished entirely.\n\nIn game, Winter goes into the Captainâs quarters to talk about something related to Dirk. The conversation goes poorly, the Captain is basically moments from tearing strips off Winterâs hide, and that might not just be an expression.\n\nGunnarâs player watches all this and has an idea. A horrible, terrible, awful idea. He talks with Kat for a bit regarding how the various members of the crew are doing. Doc is holed up in sickbay, Kat's doing endless maintenance work, the passengers are down in the hold. That accounts for most of the crew. Gunnar pauses, then asks where Winter is. She tells him - heâs talking with the captain in his quarters. Gunnarâs player rolls some dice, checks his sheet and then declares that he bolts up from the current conversation and barrels down the hall screaming âCAPTAIN! NOOOOOO!!â Then he asks the GM what heâll need to break down one of the doors in the ship.\n\nThe GM looks confused, but replies that the latches are flimsy enough to be broken by someone of Gunnarâs strength, so long as the vacuum seal isnât engaged. Gunnar nods, then makes a strength check that succeeds by a silly margin, breaking the latch and slamming the captainâs door open wide. âNot the captain!â screams Gunnar as he leaps at Winter.\n\nWinter turns in time to see three-hundred kilos of dermal-armored mutant coming at him before heâs spear-tackled into a bulkhead and taken to the ground.\n\nâWhat. The. HELL!â screams the Captain. âGunnar! The fuck are you doing?!â\n\nâSaving your life capân! The last time he alone with someone, the guy killed himself!â says Gunnar as he points a shaky finger at the puddled form of the wannabe-ninja.\n\nEveryone stares for a moment. One of the other players sniggers, which sets off another, and soon the whole room is beset by a case of the giggles. The GM buries his face in his hands.  This moment of absurdity completely breaks the gloomy tension in the room. \n\nThe session broke shortly after that, and the GM came up with an idea of how to salvage things. The game continued on for months, though the GM and several players admitted after the fact that they were absolutely ready to bail after that session, had Gunnarâs player not restored some hope that the campaign could retain any of its previous tone.",

        "text": "Previously Aagos and Venetor set up a large scale drug deal with a Toydarian and were using the force during most of the bartering. Meanwhile I took a stroll with LilâYaâti whoâs a dmpc and Zarria which quickly lead to a summary public execution and rallying the populace into a full blown riot. Cornholio and Uri are in a strip club (not at the session).\n \nFound here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/60j0qe/the_least_qualified_jedi_to_ever_take_on_the_dark/\n \nCharacter Recap \n \nOllanius Pius (me): Human who believes everything is heresy. Very good with leadership and persuasion\n \nCornholio Brown: Human who wants the booty\n \nZarria: Female Zolton with illusion based force, currently following me blown away with how out of hand things got.\n \nUri Zintok: Nautolan who is excellent with a lightsaber and dull everywhere else\n \nVenetor Praedae: Our kel dor pilot who tends to act independent at times. Working with Aagos to sell 2 crates full of drugs\n \nAagos: Our mon calamari who kept us alive with medical attention and being the voice of reason. Helped barter the sale of drugs.\n \nLilâYaâti: A young Jedi in training who raps and we found while escaping the Jedi Temple during order 66. Currently getting traumatized as he gets to accompany the jedi who rescued him from order 66 for the first time. \n \nWeâll resume things with me casually walking down the street taking everything in as the events unfolded and Iâm filled with pride. Surrounding me was a horde of civilians running amok, torching and looting businesses that have even the slightest link to Kel Darenâs crime empire (The person initially interrogated and executed name dropped him and I deduced he is the prime heretic and actively working with the dark side, therefore he must be stopped). The most obvious way is to lead a wave of chaos and destruction towards his compound, which is exactly what happened. Did a few innocent shopkeepers end up worse off than before and were there some places that suffered gravely due to being falsely accused, and maybe a couple murders happened? Yes but ya know, shit happens. Thankfully a few of the mob actually had a clue where to strike, so to their counsel the mob was directed through the streets instead of just wandering aimlessly and making the area look like DC right after trump got elected and hope we stumble upon something. \n \nWhile all this went down Aagos and Venetor were pushing hover trolleys with two crates of drugs through the center of a downtown area in a planet whose reputation was built on crime. Of course they made it totally safe and sound without any incidents due to plot. Upon arrival at the warehouse they scoped the area out and used force detect lifeforms, detecting only 3 lifeforms nearby, the dealer and two bodyguards they presumed, everything looking to be in order. They headed in and loudly called out as to avoid trigger happy bodyguards open firing on the sound of footsteps. They rounded a corner and met the trio and exchanged pleasantries and the Jedi duo invited him towards the crates. The toydarian investigated the crates and took a hit of the booster blue to test it out (he didnât have the best work ethic) then satisfied with the drug he motioned the bodyguard to produce a suitcase of a couple thousand credits like they anticipated. They took the suitcase and the two guards grabbed the trolleys and briskly walked out with them before spotlights shot into the building windows and loudspeakers loudly blared out âJEDI! We know you are in there, surrender yourselves, we have this place surrounded!â Aagos and Venetor turned towards their buyer who looked over his shoulder while flying out of the building towards safety.\n \nâYou fools, wasnât lesson one at your âJedi Schoolâ that your mind tricks donât work on me?â He said bitterly.\n \nHaving their backs against the wall of the corner they turned to go towards the deal, Aagos poked his head around only to duck back inside when blaster fire lit the area up. The two bickered about what to do when another voice came on calling himself an inquisitor (Jedi hunters, kill or captured them and turned them to the dark side if captured) and he promised to let them live and treat them well if they gave themselves up, blah blah all the jazz. The two continued to throw around ideas of how to not get captured, die horribly, or both, and the conversation turned from heated to panicked when they heard boots marching towards their position. \n \nThe zealous mob turned a corner, just a mere block away from a major Kel Daren owned warehouse when a burst of machine gun fire cut down the first few eager unlucky ruffians. I peered around the corner and with force:sense life was able to see that the local police had set up a MG nest, and behind them was a warehouse with what appeared to be a standoff with people inside. Seeing only one probable solution, I turned on my lightsaber and held it high as a beacon for the mob to look to and gave a speech that would make Joseph Stalin shed a tear before ordering everyone to charge the nest, and tear down the warehouse. I was in the middle of the mob lightsaber held high while LilâYaâTi and Zarria looked in horror wondering how something could get so out of hand. The machine gun roared to life and cut down man after man but the wave still pressed forward, the people standing around behind the sandbags desperately shot wildly into the mass of bodies and started scooting back ready to run for their lives as the mob sprinted closer and closer.\n \nThe inquisitor was having his troops encircle the two cornered jedi when a thunderous battle cry broke his concentration. He looked down the street to see and mob turn a corner and sprint towards the local authorities line of defense they set up to secure his perimeter, and felt their morale break as the mobâs rush continued unhindered despite the machine gun firing into it and his comrades madly shooting. Another thing he noticed was that in the center of the mob was a lightsaber held high. âAnother jedi coming straight at me apparently, probably rallied a local militia to save his comrades, how noble and pure.â he thought to himself. He sent all of his troopers that were on overwatch to try and stem the tide and he went over there to deal with it himself, jumping to a rooftop above the barricade and waiting for a good opportunity to strike.\n \nVenetor and Aagos heard the chaos unravelling outside and that boosted their fighting spirit a bit, they found decent hiding places and decided they were going to go down swinging. They successfully ambushed and slaughtered a few of the vanguard but as the fight went on things started going for the worse, without the overwatch from the nearby rooftops they were able to inflict heavy casualties, but became pinned behind a couple boxes as a few troopers were holed up in a far corner. A flashbang went off and they thought they were done for, but when they came back to their senses there was no more shooting, and they could hear some troopers crying out as a lightsaber cut through them, and an aged human with a green lightsaber identified himself as Rahm Kota. He explained he has been going around the galaxy and trying to save Jedi from being captured by the Inquisitor they just met, had survived order 66 as he didnât have clones with him and preferred to use mercenaries, and that they had to get out of here quick as some suicidal moron was leading an assault on the warehouse and had distracted the Inquisitor. They agreed and quickly ran out a backway which was now unguarded and took alleys and backways towards the ship, and commed LilâYaâTi and Zarria telling them that they had to get to the ship as quickly as possible and gave a quick run down of the situation.\n \nâYo man I gotta say this Ollanius fellow is fucking crazy, heâs leading a huge mob of random people to their deaths and theyâve been burning shit all day, itâs messed up man.â said the young LilâYaâTi. Venetor confirmed that Ollanius was a bit unhinged, and wondered how he was still alive or even became a Jedi, but regardless heâd prefer to not leave anyone behind.\n \nZarria said she could handle it and took over the comms. âHey Ollanius, I know youâre doing youâre thing, but what are the odds you could just chill for once and head back to the ship? Apparently thereâs sort of an incredibly powerful sith who almost captured Venetor and Aagos and is probably nearby, and will undoubtedly kill or capture us too.â\n \nâZarria I am so close to the objective, do you wish for all these deaths to mean nothing? Besides I am sure me and my army can handle one Sith, quantity has a quality of itâs own you know?â I shouted over the sound of battle confidently, just as my troops reached the barricade. After making short work of the people manning the barricade and further arming themselves, the Inquisitor lept down in front of the mob and quickly stopped it in its tracks. After a few moments of uneasy silence I told Zarria I found the Sith and will make short work of him. I loudly denounced the new foe as the prime heretic and to purge him. Following this order was a burst of machine fire from the requisitioned nest which the Inquisitor smoothly deflected all the shots into my men and the last bullet to the person manning the nest, which was the first thing to phase the crowd, and people started having second thoughts. Issuing another call to arms I told everyone to charge, and cowardice would be met with death, and started scooting backwards, then after breaking the crowd, turning to a full on sprint as the Inquisitor butchered everything in his path effortlessly carving his way towards me.\n \nI managed to reach Zarria and LilâYaâTi when the Inquisitor was 75% through the mob and told them âYeah Iâm on board with leaving.â so we all heroically sprinted like hell through the city looking over our shoulder constantly. We made it back to the ship where Venetor already had the engines spooled up and started lifting off the second we got through the doors, and were able to see the Inquisitors forces blocks away as we pulled up. \n \nSorry for the pretty big delay with this one, got caught up with school, work, and a pretty big 40k army commission, but should be back with putting these out much more frequently.

        "text": "So, this story comes from some of my earliest sessions (and I haven't had many). \n\nI was DM, and my friends PCs were the following:\n\nVollendrick, a human ranger. \n\nLord Boopy, the human paladin \n\nTorgga Frostbeard, a dwarven Barbarian\n\nThokk, the half-orc fighter \n\nPiggy, the bard\n\nMerrill High-hill, Halfling Rouge\n\nAra Nialo, High elf Wizard\n\nA colourful mix of characters, who wonderfully contrasted and complemented each other RP wise. Anyway, there were several young dragons in the game, so our barbarian decided that clearly this meant the local older dragons were easy to bed. \n\nDeep in the royal dungeon where most of the dragons had been imprisoned he came upon the first possibly seducable dragon. I give him a look that says \"are you sure?\" And he looks me in the eye, rolls seduction (a type of persuasion check, but it was homebrew). Natural. Flipping. 20. \n\nI let him have his fun but I knew that I could make this joke something more. I got a dragonborn character model and wrote up a character sheet. My players weren't die hard and didn't even have PHBs, (they used mine), so they didn't know it was impossible for a human and dragon to produce a dragonborn.\n\nA session or two later, the party encountered a young dragonborn looking for his father. Convinced by my trap the barbarian takes him in but has the half orc fighter train him. Eventually I spring that actually he's not the barbarian's son, and the party is now being attacked by a dragonborn tribe looking for their lost child. ",

        "text": "The following is a story from a session of dark heresy i played a few months ago. it involves a psyker named Marcus and a chutzpah score of over 9000.\n\nMarcus was presented as a fairly straightforward sanctioned psyker who had some special bonuses to diplomacy, explosives, and shooting. These bonuses were justified by saying he was naturally glib, and had served with the Imperial Guard. He rarely almost never used his psyker powers. During the entire campaign, he only ever manifested an offensive ability once, and it was to avoid what would otherwise have been certain death (personified as an ork nob with a very big axe.)\n\nMarcus was supposedly a specialized into divination, but was quick to tell everyone that predicting the future was an imprecise art on the best of days. He occasionally offered up predictions to the party which tended to be accurate (mundane things were easier for him to predict.) He also frequently complained of interfering energy or other phenomena blocking his gift. Most of the other PCs assumed the sight was an unsubtle way for me to provide plot armor/railroading, because dark heresy is a high-casualty game and I donât like players rolling up new characters every other session (decreases player attachment and involvement on a meta level.)\n\nThis dynamic kept going until the party encountered a cult of Nurgle, disguised as a family restaurant (gross) which magiced a great unclean one into existence (grosser). Iâd given the party a bit of NPC space marine support for the encounter, so they were equipped to deal with it. What might have been an epic battle was interrupted by Marcus screaming very loudly, soiling himself, and running at full speed in the opposite direction the instant the daemon materialized. The fight proceeded without him, and after a narrow victory and heroic sacrifice by the space marines, the party began digging around for Marcus.\n\nThey eventually found him cowering under some rubble in a near catatonic state. After brief deliberation, it was decided in short order to break into his mind to check for potential daemonic corruption with the other PC Psyker. At this point, I just handed the party this:\n\nMarcus was a psyker- he just wasnât a very good one. Shortly after his graduation from the scholastica psykana, but before his actual field deployment, Marcus had gotten drunk, and attempted to scry the warp in an intoxicated attempt to impress a co-ed. Marcus did scry the warp, but instead of seeing âa void of knowledge and mysteryâ he caught a fleeting glimpse of the outermost layers of nurgleâs garden. Fleeting though this impression was, it was enough to scar Marcus for life. He became a germaphobe, convinced that even the slightest specks of dirt could attract nurgleâs attention. He  also developed an obsessive fear of using his powers. This was understandably problematic for a person whose job revolved around doing space magic.\n\nMarcus was resourceful- he requested deployment with a remote, prestige-less imperial guard regiment. He kept his head down, and ingratiated himself with both his superiors and peers. He found that making safe predictions any reasonable person could make (it will rain in the next week, the plasma gunner will die tomorrow) was a good way to gain credit and convince people he was doing his job. Whenever he was asked to make a difficult prediction or erred, he would make up an excuse about âWarp interferenceâ or string together other big words that sounded good. He kept a large supply of custom pyrotechnics (purchased from ratlings) which he used to simulate offensive powers in a pinch.\n\nDespite the obvious disadvantage of being an employed psyker who never used psyker powers, Marcus found himself rapidly rising through the ranks of the guard. His regiment had grown to like and respect him for his reputation for never causing warp phenomena, and his commissar handler approved of his hygiene, eloquence, and generally cautious approach to all things warp. Soon, Marcus found himself enjoying a comfortable existence creating asinine predictions with hot meals and showers on battalion HQ. Things could not have been going better until Marcusâ handler told him he was personally recommending him for primaris psyker training.\n\nMarcus may have been able to fool an isolated guard unit about the specifics of psyker powers, but he held no illusions about being able to deceive the best and the brightest at the scholastica. Even more frightening was the prospect of having one of his many lies uncovered. In Marcusâ experience, people caught lying to their commanders did not live long.\n\nIn desperation, Marcus used every connection at his disposal and his personal relationship with hi commissar to secure a transfer to the ordo xenos division of the inquisition. While perhaps not an ideal assignment, Marcus would be able to dodge demons (for the most part) and hopefully not be exposed as a fraud. It wasnât a great long-term option, but it was better than the impending exposal he faced otherwise.\n\nAll the players had a laugh about this once they read it. In order reflect the Marcusâ unique personality traits, I had a rule which required Marcus to save against fear whenever he confronted daemons or warpy stuff. The mere appearance of a greater daemon created significant penalties on this roll, and anything related to nurgle (the cause of Marcusâ trauma) incurred further penalties. Marcusâ just didnât have the nerves to fight a great unclean one, and a low roll coupled with significant penalties resulted in a final total well below the critical failure threshold (which is why Marcus lost control of his bowels.)\nAnd thus poop jokes were made for the next two weeks. It was shitty, but Marcus the neurotic psychic bullshitter will always have a special place in my heart.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6dz0ey/mutants_and_masterminds_maria_the_boring/",
        "text": "The guy who runs my long-running D&amp;D game over Roll20 is also a huge fan of Overwatch, Blizzard's attempt to outdo TF2. He is the kind of guy who loves to run games; at times, he seems to prefer the DMs screen to a player's seat. So, he spent weeks trying to find a tabletop RPG system that could adequately recreate the various abilities present in Overwatch, from summoning dragon constructs to blocking bullets with a sword to being a rocket-propelled robot to teleport-parkour. Eventually, he stumbled upon Mutants and Masterminds.\n\nNow, for the uninitiated, the game of Mutants and Masterminds is a game to let people create comic books, the way D&amp;D is a game to let people create Tolkien-esque fantasy stories. Most games try to do something about the spectacle creep that inevitably comes with increasing in power. Mutants (I can't call it M&amp;M because Mars, Incorporated might sue me for copyright infringement) takes the opposite approach, and openly encourages it. A character's carrying capacity increases exponentially with their Strength score, rather than linearly like in other systems. So, there is a table that lists the carrying capacities of characters with effective Strength scores up to 150. It also gives context for these numbers, with a column labeled \"Heavy Load Examples.\" For instance, with a Strength of 50, a heavy load might be a fighter jet. With a Strength of 80, a heavy load is a small bridge. With a Strength of 130, the Golden Gate Bridge represents a heavy load. With a Strength of 150, a character can carry around a small asteroid, and consider it a good workout. This is just one example of the insanity that Mutants and Masterminds is built around.\n\nKnowing the source material, and knowing the nature of the game, I decided to be contrarian. In this world of bright costumes and prominent heroes, I decided to be the most boring character ever. I don't mean forgettable; I'm not building [Solomon the Anonymous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3w1i0n/mutants_and_masterminds_how_a_street_thug_beat_a/) here. I mean that there are real-life people with more interesting backstories than Maria Raciend. In a world of costumes and heroics, this woman wears a plain business suit. The other players were all recruited to the Overwatch organization because of their exceptional skills and great achievements. Maria was recruited at a job fair her senior year of college. I describe her as \"Random Engineer number 8,\" and I mean it. \n\nApparently, however, Maria stands out by not standing out. The other players are a bow-wielding assassin (Think Hanzo from the real game, or Oliver Queen from Arrow), Judge Joseph Dredd, and a shield robot with a human handler/mad scientist. Each of them has a well-developed backstory, with significant events and motivations. Yet, the DM decided that Maria's backstory was worth building on. We were dispatched on our trial run mission, subduing riots in a nearby city (If anyone cares, the city is Dorado and the rioters are the Los Muertos gang from the [Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPRRupAM4DI) cinematic). We all used this as the opportunity to learn how the game worked, mostly through trial and error. It took approximately five times as long as it should have, but that was just as well in the end from a story perspective. \n\nWhen we got back to our headquarters at Watchpoint Gibraltar (Yes, the DM specified that it was that map), we found the base in lockdown. A little breaking-and-entering got us back in, to find that the computer system had been hacked. The hacker had apparently accessed a lot of files, with a focus on personnel information. We all got nervous at this last detail, and began working on improving base security. \n\nLess than a day later, I received a coded email from an unknown address. After running the gauntlet of antivirus systems, the email read simply \"I want to meet. Follow this radio frequency. Alan Hartford.\" One Gather Information check later, the DM informed me that I recognized this name. I had gone to school with this man. In fact, the last time I had seen him had been at the job fair. He had clearly also been trying for the job with Torbjorn Lindholm (The Overwatch hero that was the crazy inventor guy, and head of the Overwatch technology division). Alan was currently the CEO of Size Matters Industries (Yes, really), which specialized in making technology more compact and space-efficient. After a brief discussion, we all agreed to go to the meeting he had set up. After all, if he wanted us dead he could simply have left a bomb in our headquarters. \n\nSo, the radio transmission he referenced turned out to lead to an empty field. We doubted he would actually try anything, but it would be foolish not to check anyway. Sure enough, it turned up no signs of any kinds of traps. We landed, and exited the plane. As soon as my pumps hit the grass, a man's voice began speaking through my headset. I forcibly avoided reacting to the fact that it was a secure channel. \n\n\"Hello Maria,\" he said, his voice dripping with false sincerity.\n\n\"Alan, is it?\" I responded, putting everything I had into the shitty British accent I spent hours practicing with lots of youtube tutorials. The videos were helpful, but I'm no actor.\n\n\"Yes, it is. I've been thinking about that day, back at Oxford. That job fair. I just have one question: Why you?\"\n\n\"I had spent months --MONTHS!-- working on that prototype I showed Torbjorn! After the fair, I wrote him a letter a day for over a year, begging him to take me on. But, he never responded. So, I decided to get even. I built Size Matters Industries from the ground up, with the technologies I had developed. For a while, it was enough just to show him that my technology was worthwhile. But, no. I still hear about the mighty heroics of Overwatch, and still remember that I could have been part of it, if someone else had not taken the job instead. So, I ask again, Maria. Why you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I responded, stretching my acting abilities well past their breaking point, \"It's not that your engineering is inadequate. I just happened to have the blend of technical and social skills he needed at the time.\"\n\nPartially as a credit to the DM's writing, and partially as a credit to his delivery, the response sent a chill down my spine in real life.\n\"I wish that made me feel better.\"\n\n\"I wish so to.\"\n\n\"Look down, Maria.\" I mentally braced myself to see a laser dot on my chest, and prepared a sarcastic remark. Instead, I saw the shape of a man growing from invisibly small to human sized, and punching me in the jaw. With the bonuses from size-changing as part of an attack, the blow was strong enough to knock me out cold. The session ended there.\n\nWe took down Alan within the next couple of sessions, and are now working our way through his allies and support staff. I am still amazed that my incredibly boring character managed to make as much of an impression on the game as she did. I guess it's a credit to the DM, more than anything else. He told me before the game that \"You'd be amazed what I can do with a job fair.\" He was right.",

        "text": "This is a story about the free videogame Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. For those who don't know it, it's essentially a Zombie Apocalypse Roguelike. You die a lot and try to survive in a world filled with all kinds of zombies and other dangerous creatures, including the infamously deadly Moose (which is just an actual non-zombified moose), but that's a story for another time.\n\nI'd been travelling for a while, having gotten myself a car, though I tended to gravitate around and back towards a certain town, which happened to have a hospital in it. Hospitals are very dangerous, as you might imagine, filled with all kinds of dangerous undead, but they carry some very hefty rewards in the form of medical supplies, and the immensely useful Mr. Stem Cell, a static station capable of mending broken limbs in a matter of seconds that would otherwise require days of slow healing in a splint.\n\nAs I'd gotten my limbs broken quite a few times already, and was starting to become frankly a bit sick of it, I decided to go and clean out the hospital. So I grabbed my home-forged machete, strapped on my gear, and went to work. However, I immediately ran into a major issue: the place was fucking massive, and the task a chore at best. Clearing out every single room in this pitch dark (no lights in the apocalypse obviously) complex, and with zombies that might pop out of a corner at any time and mess my shit up if I didn't react in time, was neither easy nor enjoyable.\n\nStill, I went about it, for lack of a better option. I was taking enough hits from surprise zombies that I was starting to think I'd have to back off, recover, and finish the job another day. That is, until I found a certain item while looting a corpse I'd just put (back) down. To this day, I still have no idea why this guy would have been carrying that thing around in a hospital, or how it managed to remain perfectly intact during all that time, but seeing it gave me an idea, which became a plan, which I immediately put into action.\n\nAnd so it came to be that, in the grim world of the Cataclysm, in the dark and death-filled hallways of an abandoned hospital, with corpses strewn around the floor, the stench of blood and rot thick in the air, and the bodies of the formerly living shambling about, seeking a prey to kill and convert, a survivor calmly strode about, and with him came the beautiful and soulful sounds of a gleaming full-size Tenor Saxophone which he wore with a strap around his neck and played with one hand, while he used the other to kill approaching undead corpses lured to him by the sound of the music.\n\nBy the power of Jazz and Soul, I managed to clear the entire place with barely a scratch, and in record time as well. My survivor kept the Saxophone (which he cleaned and lovingly maintained afterwards), and the dreary world of the Cataclysm became just a tiny bit safer, and a hell of a lot more soulful.",

        "text": "This is gonna be long but is all about the anthology of my first dnd character that i played for about 10 years on and off again. Me and my friends all agreed when we started that all our characters would exist in the same world. So someones level 20 sorcerer from 2 years ago could come back and change world events for characters made today. This meant your actions carried weight from character to character and year to year. Your level 20 barb conquered the north well thats the character you had to negotiate with if you wanted anything done in the north and so on.\n\nSo my first character was an elven archer who eventually through wizard and fighter levels became a arcane archer. He esentually used staffs of magic and sick bow skills to do as he pleased. He was solely fueled by greed and the pursuit of ever increasingly powerful magic items.\n\nHe started at level 1 and ended at level 20. My first party with him was standard in nature and we eventually are tasked with robbing a bank of sorts. We accomplished this by putting a ring gate within the vault and using the other one to simply walk in. After this heist i was hooked. It never occured to me that DnD would have banks in it for some silly reason. \n\nMy party however did not have my same lust for gold and power. So we split up and my character was a solo act. Robbing, looting, and stealing until my wealth rivaled nations. This drew some serious attention. However every challenger fell to overwhelming magic and arrows. \n\nOne day I find a lead on the ultimate prize, the staff of the magi. A truly supreme artifact. It is held in a vault owned by a orc king named IP. Now ip was a friends first character and he was also very successful. He was also level 20 and owned his own red dragon army complete with breeding grounds. He held a nation in the north from his conquests and banned magic in all ways except his own dragons. He mostly kept to himself but was unchallenged in sheer power.\n\nI did not care i must attain my prize. With some serious expenditure of resources and gold via bribery i manage to sneak into his vault only to have the door slam shut behind me. I figure welp he may hunt me down but im out of here. I grab my prize and proceed to try and teleport. No go, i try and gaseous form out. No go. The very steel the vault is made of has been imbued with antimagic fields. \n\nI am captured and striped of all that i own and but to death by combat. A dragon makes short work of me without my bow or magic. As a contingency from forever ago a priest that had me as a generous donor to his congregation true resurects me. \n\nI gather my last remaining stashed goodies and head back north hell bent upon revenge. I have a ring of wishes and a mind for chaos. Sure i could of built my wealth back but vengeance is the best kind of treasure.\n\nI get outside the city of IP and wish for 3 things. \n\nFirst: that the tarasque never hibernates\n\nSecond: the tarasques only wish is to kill IP and all he cherishes.\n\nThird: the tarasque appear here and now.\n\nTo this day an army of red dragons and IP fight a never ending battle against an impossible foe.\n\nMy friend who owns IP has never really forgiven me.\nMy elf retired shortly after.",

        "text": "One of the people in my core group of friends has been dying to get the rest of us together for DnD, and this past Monday all our schedules finally lined up. I won't go into the whole session here (partly because I got drunker as the night went on and don't remember the details, partly because half of it was character creation), but I do want to share the highlight of the session.\n\nMy character is named Bing. He's a human male, fighter class with a focus in ranged fighting. My skills are survival and animal handling. I lived in the forest with my wife and two children, a boy and a girl, in a cabin I built myself. One afternoon, when I returned from a three day hunt, I found my family had been slaughtered by a bear. After burying them I hunted down the bear, killed it, and now live alone in that same cabin, brooding and surviving. Sad story, right?\n\nNow, our DM has our party trying to find some missing kids, and I take this personally. On our first evening out, after we've already set up camp, I roll to check my traps and see if I've gotten anything. I roll a 2, meaning I got fuck all in food for the group. I come back to the camp, feeling dejected. So, another member in our group decides to try her hand at hunting.\n\nI forget her character's name, but it's a 6'9'', 240 pound, butt-ugly elf dressed as a Hasidic Jew. Also, he's a tattoo artist and isn't on speaking terms with his family. She decides to hide up in a tree and wait for a deer. The deer comes along, and she rolls to jump out of the tree and drop the poor thing with a sword. She rolls a 15. So the elf leaps from what I assume was an incredibly sturdy branch and skewers the deer.\n\nThen, if I remember correctly, the DM says she can roll again for a melee attack (that may have been one of her skills or something), so she's like \"Why not?\", rolls again, and gets an 11.\n\nSo this tall-ass Jewish linebacker of an elf throws a haymaker into the deer's face and breaks the fuck out of its jaw.\n\nThe elf walks back into camp with the deer slung over his shoulder and we all eat rather well. And I, the hunter of the camp, continue to brood in my tent and resent how that elf was a better hunter than I was.",

        "text": "Our story begins in the dark ages of when the party was level 2(truly the dark times). After a bloody battle at night in the dwarven town square against some freshly raised undead, the party discovered that Al'ad, the elf who was posing as a counselor sent to the town on behalf of the Empress, was in fact a secret agent working for \"the Necromancer\".\n\nThe party infiltrated his house and found enough proofs to incriminate him, while also discovering the almost ridiculous level of devotion that Al'ad had for his master.\n\nThey confronted him in the City Hall, a battle ensued and they killed him.\nBut they made a fatal mistake, they didn't burn the body or blessed it!\n\nBecause you see, the deep regret for having failed his master, the burning hatred for those idiots who foiled his plans and the fact that he was working with some really screwed up magic of the necromantic variety without safety equipment, raised him again, as a revenge-hungry revenant.\n\nThe party went on on their mission. One night, almost a week later, they were riding towards the Empire's Capital on the back of stolen horses(that belonged to some orcish construction workers whom they killed because of a misunderstanding), when they heard the ungodly neigh of a Nightmare chasing them. \n\nThe Necromancer, pleased with the devotion that Al'ad demonstrated, gifted his now undead minion with the infernal mount, and he was now chasing the party.\n\n....he got obliterated. Only the young sorceress fell momentarily, but just because she decided to go directly under the Nightmare's hooves.\nDeafeat once again, Al'ad unleashed his trump card: he had rigged his own body to explode if he were to die again. The explosion caught the Cleric in full force...but he succeeded his DEX save and the fireball only slightly burnt his eyebrows.\n\nWhen Al'ad reformed once again in a new body, the Necromancer decided to change his game plan: he would raise an army of undead, move the entire mountain with it and march towards the Capital (he needed a specific girl to complete a ritual). Meanwhile the party was on Mechanus, getting their asses kicked by robots.\n\nThe army was about to collide with the Imperial Army, Al'ad was biding his time in the shadow of the now floating mountain, sitting on his shining new mount: a Shadow Dragon. But something unexpected happened\n\nThe party was Planeshifted back right in that moment, in front of the Capital's outer walls, and was now destroying dozens of undeads without a sweat.\n\nAl'ad cried, his fit of rage inaudible over the chaos of the battle, and charged into battle. \n\n\"Wait, is he that guy?\" Said the ranger.\n\n\"What guy?\" asked the barbarian.\n\n\"THAT guy! You know, the undead guy that we killed that one time...what was his name?\" replied the ranger.\n\n\"Oh...I wasn't playing yet back then, can I charge him?\" inquired the barbarian.\n\n\"Well, you do have a flying speed that is equal to your normal movement speed. I say your Charger feat applies to this!\" answered the voice of an unnamed god.\n\nAl'ad barely managed to cast one spell, before being rammed by a flying half-elf, struck by a legendary sword, and losing his grip on the reins. He was now falling fast, but maybe he could have survived the fall if he could just....\n\n\"I cast Scorching Rays on the falling undead dude\". Shouted the Sorceress.\n\nAl'ad was vaporized before he could hit the ground. His cursed soul started traveling to once again find a new host.\n\n\nNow, months later, the Necromancer is dead. Al'ad decided that maybe all this revenge thing isn't for him, bought a nice farm and is now un-living quietly,",

Precariously it was placed in a room deep within the citadel, the party found that there were a few entry points into this area. Deciding to err on the side of caution, and not realizing that the Goblins inside were pretty much civilians they barricaded two of the doors; however, when they realized there was an entry choke point into the area where the hobgoblin boss was they decided on a precarious plan.\n\n\n\nThey would rush the room and as half the party went to confront the boss the other half, mainly the lawful good Aasimar Rhea and the Elf Ranger Jazmine would throw oil at the door and shoot it with a flaming arrow respectively. Thus, the party would create even more of a choke point. This plan went very well.... to the point where they forgot they had blocked off two doors to relatively stupid creatures that wouldn't willingly go through a fire to escape. Not to mention the fact that the town was located in a extremely poorly ventilated area.\n\n\n\nEventually, once the battle with the boss had come to completion, they realized what had happened. They entered the town to find goblin women, children, 4 warriors, and elderly goblins all asphyxiated on smoke inhalation. Rhea, the Cleric went about sparing the dying... at least stabilizing them to make sure they wouldn't die. While Densharr played a ballad and was beside himself with grief (it had been his plan to create the choke points and start the fire). Tai, the Goliath Fighter went to Rhea and offered a high five saying, \"Good job, you killed them all!\" This did not go well for group dynamics, and he was shunned for quite some time afterwards... for you see... Rhea is a pacifist and only heals people, not participating in the actual combat.\n\n\n\nSo, unfortunately the party has to live with the fact that they nearly murdered non-combatants and how that may effect them for adventures to come! All except for Tai.... he is kind of a dick.",

Very chaotic, I played them as someone with multiple personality disorder who switched forms alongside a personality switch. It was a lot of fun, and a really interesting way to bring a lot more roleplay into the character.\n\nNotice how I said \"was.\"\n\nOur party was trying to make our way into a dwarf mine in order to find the MacGuffin of the week, and I shapeshifted into a generic dwarf to bluff our way in as the son of a local dwarf lord. Everything was going fine-- until a mob of gnolls started an invasion.\n\nI wasn't too worried, until they started throwing magic around. Apparently these gnolls knew Lightning Bolt. Who knew?\n\nWe fought our hardest, and while my party was chugging along, I had ended up seperated and on the brink of death. I was trying to find a clever way to get out of being cornered by two wizard-gnolls slowly approaching me.\n\nI cast a Wall of Fire around myself, surrounding me in a very tight circle and directing the radius of heat damage out towards the attackers. My DM congratulated me on a really clever tactic, then informed me that they both survived the fire-- and that it was their turn to attack.\n\nTwo Lightning Bolts. Two failed saves. One toasted Sorcerer.\n\nIt was the first death our group had via the \"negative max health\" method, where I took more damage than my remaining health plus my max. I was bummed out, but kinda excited to be the first.\n\nHowever, I suggested that, to add some drama, we could toss in one last Wild Magic Surge. Maybe even on my last breaths I could push the battle in a nice direction.\n\nRolled a d100. 92.\n\n\"If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell.\"\n\nWe all *lost it.* The table went from weepy eyes over a dead character to maniac laughter. Dead, then straight back to life.\n\nWe then took a trip down to the spell pages to roll for the race I would pop into. I was forming a plan in my head on how to explain this to the dwarves. Why did the dwarven prince just turn into a lizard, or a gnome, or worst of all an elf?\n\nRoll a d100. 20. Mountain Dwarf.\n\nDM couldn't stop laughing for a good five minutes.\n\nHe described what it was like from the view of the others: The wall of fire faded away as the lightning bolts hit me. My skin started to bubble and shift. Suddenly, my whole body exploded. And then just as suddenly, the pieces switched directions and put themselves back together, good as new. It took me a good two days (in game) to figure out if I had died at all.\n\nLater my character had his soul removed and replaced with a serial killer. I'm starting to think that this one might need to be retired...\n\n",

I have a terrible memory, but I remember enough to tell this.\n\nSo, in Space Station 13, you have different roles on the station to roleplay as. I can't remember if I wanted to be a Captain or not, but that's what I spawned in as. As Ship Captain, I started off by grabbing the Nuke Disc. The Nuke Disc is important, because if someone drops that into a bomb, it could kill the entire station in about ten seconds. This is the first important thing: I put the Nuke Disc into my backpack, but I don't put it in just like that. I conceal it in the box that comes with your backpack, which contains an Oxygen Mask, an Air Tank, and such.\n\nSo I put it in the box, do roll call, and I think it was early on that this happened, but I don't remember. But yeah, we get a call that Redsuits are breaching. Redsuits are the Antag class, or the villains of each round. In this case, Redsuits are Nuke Ops: Antags who attempt to grab the Nuke Disc to kill everyone. In the backstory, they are enemies of the Space Station's funders, Nanotrasen.\n\nSo the A.I calls up, and says something to the effect of putting the box in his quarters, which I decide to do. Then a Redsuit kills me. And this is where it gets funny. They breach the room, and cover the box in debris...let me repeat, they *cover the box*...in *debris*.\n\nSo, for about *15 minutes*, like five highly trained operatives with enough firepower to take over Ireland if they wanted to are following the pinpointer to find the Disc, only to not see the box it's in under some rubble. So they basically stay in there like lemons, looking everywhere they can, for a Disc that's in a box that they accidentally covered up.\n\nThey eventually found it, and I *think* they won? I can't remember. Point is, it was hilarious to see. I know I forgot some details, so if anyone who stumbles across this was in that round, on the Yogstation that day, fill in the blanks!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6c4sii/dd_5e_the_tale_of_how_we_killed_the/",
        "text": "So, we had previously encountered brief mentions of the Languishing God and about how it could take away your curses, so a couple members of our party were interested in it, one being a half-wendigo or turning into a wendigo, and the other being cursed to have goat legs, which being a vain elf, she hated beyond everything.\n\nAfter they got their curses removed by drinking the things blood or something, the whole church started to vibrate with it's heartbeat. We had to kill the two main lackeys of the god, an older human man with a lump on his back and his wife, who was blind and always kept her eyes shut because of it.\n\nDuring the fight with the old couple, the god, who took up a whole cellar wall at least, and as it turns out, a lot of space underneath the church as well, decides to take off and go stomping at the village that had formed around its church.\n\nDuring all this we continued to fight the couple, and the man tries charging at us but because of the ruckus he instead accidentally runs out the door, presumably to his death.\n\nThen the rest of the party focused on the woman, who had been mainly fighting the aforementioned elf instead because the elf told me to \"fuck off, don't come near me!\" when i asked if she handle herself. This was partly because of hallucinating that all the people she owed money to had shown up, and partly because she (the character, not the player) is a bit of a bitch.\n\nFinally, we managed to kill her as well, and after that the half-wendigo ranger decided to torch her eye sockets, because bugs had come out of there before and nearly eaten them alive, so he wanted to make sure they didn't get to come back out after they retreated back in there after the woman had died. This caused the bugs to eat their way out of her corpse. We joked that \"that's one way to make sure she's actually dead\".\n\nSo we decided to head to the cellar where the languishing gods face, head, something was, so we could kill it. It was at this time that the two rangers (the now-human and the not-goat-legged elf) decided they wanted nothing to do with this and jumped off. Somehow they managed to survive, if barely.\n\nSo, me (a black dragonborn monk), Zero (black dragonborn paladin) and a rogue who had recently (in the last session) joined our group decided \"It's death or glory\" and began to attack the languishing god. Though first the rogue had decided to go down the rope the human ranger used to get down, saw the havoc the god was causing and decided to take her chances at fighting it with us.\n\nWe eventually dealt enough damage to it (though not before the  rogue had a crit. fail at shooting an arrow at the god and instead shooting at me and me catching the arrow, thank you dodge missiles) to expose it's heart. I threw darts at it, the paladin used some warlock spell that did nothing (yeah, he decided to multiclass into a warlock at lv.4), and then finally the rogue shot an arrow that killed it, and we had to get out of there.\n\nSo, i jumped off using slow fall, and managed to survive with about 5 hp. Then, OOC we joked about how Zero should throw the small human female rogue and i would catch her, using deflect missiles. The DM allowed this, rolling a D20 and if i could beat what it rolled, i managed to catch her, and if not then i didn't catch her. I managed to get her, it wasn't even that hard, since the DM rolled a 5, and deflect missiles being a D10+dex.mod+monk lvl. The latter two come up to eight (4+4) for me, as i'm level four.\n\nAt first it seemed like Zero had died, at least for the characters, but moments after the church had fallen down we hear cursing in draconic. He had hidden inside the dead god, inside where the heart was. When he got out, he was covered in blood.\n\nMe and Zero (due to us graduating from the school we play at) decided that this was enough adventuring for us and we just walked away, possibly with me joining his religion.",

        "text": "So, let me tell you a tale of complete and utter madness, insane rolls, unexpected player decisions, and absolute nonsense. \n\n**TL:DR** ; My party of 5 level 6 PCs with the help of a level 20 monk killed a horde of undead and a CR 23 dracolich.\n\nTo begin, our cast of participants:\n\n**Kotri** - Androgynous Dwarf Cleric of Poseidon, wears a full plate bikini and wields a trident. Hates paladins, can't save money, and is permanently beautiful as a nymph.\n\n**Unabeth** - Generic female Human Ranger, ex-criminal attempting to atone for dead brother. Archer of extreme skill. HATES undead.\n\n**B.B. (Big Beef)** - Also known as the Dwarf Legend, the Puncher of Gods. Half-Orc Barbarian, roves the land drinking and making friends.\n\n**Aelin** - Half-Elf Druid, nature lover and friend to trees everywhere.\n\n**Corrin** - THE Halfling Bard. He is chaotic bard. Wand of Wonder using [Orrex's Table of Random Effects](http://www.traykon.com/pdf/The_Net_Libram_of_Random_Magical_Effects.pdf) that has 3 charges per day.\n\n**Roth** - 20th level half-devil halfling monk npc. More details in story.\n\n**Kizdek** - 3rd level Kobold Rogue native of the underground city they are exploring.\n\n****\n\nThe backstory begins. Our party is playing in the Pathfinder universe, and as such are Pathfinders. They're current mission is in the Houjin Tapestry exploring the area around a city of Dragonslayers. While tracking them, they ran across a long dead Kobold city. Stuff happened, they found an immortal halfling in a silver dust circle (no one rolled knowledge arcana) whom they promptly released. He released the Kobold from a stasis coffin, and then they went about exploring the city, knowing that the city was ruled by an ancient blue dragon and that there is a horde of undead near its lair. Right, stage set. \n\nNow for the fun stuff. All pictures relevant for story.\n\n****\n\nThe story begins with our party standing outside of a fence cordoning off a literal [horde of undead.](http://imgur.com/a/ezAl9) The skeletons shambled about aimlessly, ignoring the party. The dracolich on the landing 40' up was seemingly asleep. The party debated about what to do, and decided that Kotri could cast Speak with Dead, and so they needed to collect a head from one of the skeletons. So.... [Kotri stood on B.B.'s shoulders](http://imgur.com/a/863NY), and Unabeth used a grappling arrow to shoot one through it's head so that Kotri could reel it in. Then they'd \"retreat.\" This succeeded. Then Kotri realized that the undead needed to be dead again for Speak with Dead to work. So Kotri cast Sacred Flame. And rolled a 1. So she hit one of the minotaur skeletons. Then the horde became aware of the party.       \n    \nRoll for initiative. [They swarmed.](http://imgur.com/a/kvT9H)    \n    \nFight begins. Dracolich goes last. It goes on like normal, until its turn. \"Who dares enter my domain?\" --&gt; Aelin prostrated herself before it. BB introduced herself with all of her titles. Unabeth replies with \"YOUR MOM!!\"     \n     \n.... This was not well received. At this point, Roth offered to help (he had been notoriously unhelpful up to this point), but said they would owe him a price to be decided later (spoiler, it was souls). All agreed. [Roth leaped onto the dracolich.](http://imgur.com/a/qR4YJ) A clash of titans begins above the party, as they fight a swarm down below. [My party was jokingly a little mad at me at this point.](http://imgur.com/a/PPm4Y)      \n      \nAnd now for the shenanigans. Unabeth had a Tree Feather Token. (For those who don't know, when activated this one time use item creates a 60 ft tall oak tree provided there is room.) She tied it to an arrow, and shot it at Roth while shouting \"Think fast!!\" Monk reflexes kicked in, he caught the arrow, and then suddenly, there was a tree. Roth wielded this like a quarterstaff (24 strength). It hurt. [This](http://imgur.com/a/8mbj7) was the damage from his first round of flurries.    \n     \n[Update to the swarm at this point.](http://imgur.com/a/ynHj5)   \n     \nNow, the party took these shenanigans to heart, believing they were about to TPK. So, they let loose with all they had. Aelin summoned a giant eagle, Kizdek drank a potion of fly, Kotri got Poseidon to force Roth to help in exchange for her firstborn, BB used her [Brass Horn of Valhalla](http://imgur.com/a/gO1y2) (got 11 summoned spirit vikings), and Roth managed to break the tree with the dracolich. At this point, [Immigrant Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEGuHdKn0Lc) became a rallying cry.    \n     \nThen BB planted all 12 of her Beans from her Bag of Beans, knowing that with fertilizer they'd grow in one round instead of a minute. She decided (was persuaded by me) to do each one's effect differently. [She got](http://imgur.com/a/Cv2AV) 4 hungry Bulette's, 3 campfires, a geyser of now flaming oil, one fruit tree, a friendly Treant, 7 eggs, and an extremely hateful statue. At this point, I began running out of appropriate minis.    \n      \nSeeing as most of the party was under half HP or unconscious, Corrin decided he would whip out [Leomund's Tiny Hut.](http://imgur.com/a/ONwax) I had not realized exactly how OP this spell is. WTF. [Kizdek also somehow riding the dracolich.](http://imgur.com/a/cei39) So then they sat inside until Roth managed to finish off the dracolich. The party had done nearly half its HP, and [Roth did the rest.](http://imgur.com/a/M7Y9p) All for the low low price of one baby, the party is now level 9.    \n     \nCongrats assholes, my hell arc is now scrapped. \n\n",

        "text": "Now, this is from the same campaign as the [Field Surgery](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/62qimp/field_surgery/) story - we're in a war torn city fought over by multiple factions, and Doc was the character who did the titular surgery there. Doc's player was a new addition to the group, brought in because his girlfriend said he was interested, and his girlfriend was the ex of two other players in the group. I'm not *entirely* sure he ever fully grasped the way RPG's work aside from the purely mechanical.\n\nAt any rate, he came into the game, and noted that our little squad lacked a real medic.  We were entirely dependent on the psychic lizardman's biomancy for healing. So he rolled up a cyborg doctor who was relatively tough and used his cybernetics to compensate for his less than stellar shooting skills. In his first session, he was introduced to the party at a relatively safe camp in some mostly intact apartment buildings. We all gratefully went to sleep somewhere where an ambush was not imminent. Except for Doc, who was on war footing because he was playing a game, therefore stuff was happening. Doc decided to do a patrol, and walk around the building. Since Doc is a doctor and not on the patrol schedule, he doesn't know anything about the guards or their schedules. He hears a loud thumping sound on the third floor and sees a giant hulking shape in the darkness. PANIC? PANIC! Doc fires his rifle at it, then dives out the window to safety, only injuring his leg slightly in the process. Our friendly guard in powered armor is very confused when he sees the camp's doctor fire at him then leap out a window. With the psychic lizard's help, the guard forgets that happened, and we shanghai the doctor away to be part of our understrength, nearly piratical spec-ops squad.\n\nWe eventually come to regret this decision. \n\nWhat follows is a highlights reel of Doc-brand cyborg fuckups:\n\nAt one point, we get locked down by a gunship circling the building we're in and just hosing it with high velocity, armor piercing fire. We manage to get ourselves into the sewer system, but the whole area is under assault by a fairly high tech group of baddies, and we all need to be careful about being detected. We get down into the sewers, and have to split up to get there. The sewers have a few isolated enemies patrolling, but we're split up so we can't exactly dogpile them before they'd raise the alarm. We slowly creep around and are mostly in the clear. Then one of us botches a stealth roll and makes some noise. The enemies fail to hear it but Doc does, and in a moment of metagaming, radios to our squad, \"Hey Donut, is that you?\" Cue a dozen goons in powered armor all converging on us. We barely managed to get away, and healing up from that particular misadventure is what caused Field Surgery to be a story.\n\nFollow that up with the botched surgical prep and 30-realtime-minutes argument in [Field Surgery](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/62qimp/field_surgery/). \n\nLater on, we manage to get one of the nominally enemy factions to pay us back a favor, and lend us a guide and some scouts to get us back to our lines. Now we have to travel through territory currently held by... well, lets call them the Mad Max faction, since they were an unruly mob of troublemakers with slapdash armor and weaponry, but they were all crazy and there were a lot of them. Their primary barracks is a former hotel, C-shaped, and built around a giant reflecting pool that extends out from between the wings. As we were sneaking around, we have to cross by this hotel. So we're creeping from one end of the wings to the other when Doc declares \"I jump in the reflecting pool.\"\n\nThe DM just goggles at him. \"What? Are you *sure*?\" That last said in that special tone DM's use to convey that you are considering doing something supremely stupid, and you should take the out they are offering.\n\nDoc is positive that this is a good idea. He jumps in the pool - which has had no power to pumps or filters for weeks, and is a lovely shade of green from the algae. His splashing attracts attention, the alarm is raised, and an unruly mob of maniacs floods out of the hotel. We're looking at facing down a mob of enemies 50-100 strong when the best CQC guy in our squad has a brain wave and challenges their best melee fighter to a fight, to forestall a firefight that will end badly for us. He ends up having to fight a wookiee-analog in gladiatorial combat, and just barely manages to squeak by due to having a knife designed to punch through powered armor. The mob howls when he wins, and we barely escape before someone in the circle of enemies decides that using a knife was cheating. In the aftermath, the entire party glares at Doc and demands he justify this bullshit.\n\n\"What? We're all dirty from crawling through the sewers. I thought I'd wash up.\" is his reply. \n\nAt another point, we were trying to make off with a cargo ship, and kept getting weird readings on motion trackers and thermals. The area was currently being fought over by the biotech and radiation ammo factions, and we were trying something under their noses. We keep hearing noises and stuff in the hold, and go down to investigate. Doc separates himself from the rest of the group, because of course he does. Down in the hold he keeps hearing monster noises - heavy breathing, the rasp of claws on deck plating, occasional chittering. He decides he needs to be somewhere safe, so he opens a shipping container and backs into it, rifle pointing out, never checking the contents of said container. There was never a more *perfect* horror movie setup by a PC, and he was the only one surprised when horrible monster drool landed on his shoulder as he trained his rifle on the door. Turns out the ship was absolutely stuffed with mantis-like discount xenomorphs.\n\nDespite his idiocy, Doc never died. He always managed to get help in time, and played through two more campaigns with us. ",

        "text": "Edit:  Forgot to mention, this was 5e, probably homebrewed since it was the first time for 99% of us.\n\nThis occurred earlier today.  It was very early in the campaign, only the 2nd combat encounter, we were all still level 1.  It was the first time our DM was DMing and for all but one of us this was our very first campaign we ever played.  Beer and pizza was in plentiful supply, so judgementsâ and memory were a bit impaired.  Clearly things were destined to go wonderfully.\n\nCast:  \n\n* Jason the Human Barbarian (Me)\n* AndrÃ© the Dragonborn Paladin (Played in this instance as an NPC due to the player being absent)\n* Mako the Human Monk (The only one here with d&amp;amp;d experience)\n* [Name Forgotten] the Lady Dark Elf (Either a rogue or a thief, can't remember)\n* [Name Forgotten] the Tiefling Sorcerer (Who also had a crossbow for some reason)\n\nThe pentuplet platoon of passerbys find themselves in the town of Greenest, currently being sacked.  After sneaking around and getting some information from some children hiding in a house nearby, we find the ones who are sacking the place:  \n\n* The Brawn:  3 Dragonborn soliders with 45 hp apiece\n* The Brains:  a halfling with a more modest 20 hp.\n\nThe enemy stood in front of a small house south of our position, the halfling giving out orders that none of us were able to understand.  Mako snuck around the east side of the house to sneak up on the halfling with AndrÃ© and Jason trailing behind.  Meanwhile, the dark elf and the tiefling snuck around the west side of the house to sneak up on the soliders.\n\nMako, being the only character who was built properly, was able to one-shot the halfling with a powerful open palm hit to the base of the spine.  The soldiers were confused and caught off guard, but that didn't stop one of them (Who we will call â1)  from managing to get past Mako's 19 AC and get in a devastating blow, knocking Mako down from 12hp to 1hp.  AndrÃ© missed his attack, the Tiefling cast a protective spell on himself, and the dark elf managed to stab â2 in the back for a decent amount of damage.  â2 and â3 went next.  â2 missed completely, but â3 up and bit AndrÃ©, dropping him from 14hp to 8hp.\n\nWe were beginning to think that things were not going to go well for us.  That is when RNGesus began to smile.\n\nJason was last to attack in this turn, and seeing his long time friend AndrÃ© get chomped on sends him into a rage (doubling his damage).  This was then compounded by the rolling of a natural 20.  It then came to the rolling of a d8 to determine the damage his warhammer would impart.\n\nAnd the damn thing came up 8.\n\n8+4 atk bonus = 12     \n12â¢2 rage bonus = 24    \n24â¢2 critical bonus = **48 Fucking damage!**\n\nWith a primal scream and one mighty swing of his warhammer, Jason decapitated â3, launching his head into God knows where.  All in attendance were shocked.\n\nThe smile continuedâ in the next turn when â1 got a natural 1 and smacked â2 in the face with his tail for considerable damage, followed immediately by our dark elf getting a natural 20 of her own, though it would be Jason who landed the final blow.  â1's luck didn't seem to change as he repeatedlyâ failed while the lot of us pummeled him into mulch, ending with Mako landing the final blow in a bit of poetic irony (or something like that).\n\nAnd that's the story of how we all learned to say our daily prayers to RNGesus.  God bless your rolls, amen.",

Sorry it took so long to follow up, I didn't want to finish the write up until the players were done with the arc.\n\n---\n\nThe party:  \n  * Alex, an undead monk, cursed with lichdom.  \n  * Bob, a bolt ace/alchemist  \n  * Charles, a Cleric of Sarenrae, Goddess of Healing and Redemption  \n  * Daniel, a Paladin of Iomedae, Goddess of Glory and Valor  \n  * Eric, a Rogue - this player's previous character died the previous session, and their replacement was not present for the trip to the adventurer's guild\n\n---\n\nWhen we left last post, the party (minus Eric) had just signed a contract with the local Adventurer's guild, despite its overall shadiness.  Eric joins them as they leave, offering to read over those contracts of theirs.  \n\nWith Eric's skilled eyes, the party discovers that several seemingly throwaway lines in the sales pitch were unfortunately more real and more restrictive than they expected; the contract would indeed provide incredible amounts of gold in exchange for killing a giant worm; however, that would not be the end of the contract, and the contract additionally had the sort of cancellation clauses you would expect from a contract with a Devil.\n\nCleric Charles and Paladin Daniel are angry/worried now.  \"How could you forsake me?\" they cry to their Gods.  Quick note: They have not yet Fallen. They are your normal, everyday Cleric and Paladin, who just so happen to have chosen to sign a contract to kill something.\n\nWith their pleas for mercy proving unproductive, the party arranges transportation to the  worm they were hired to kill.  They take a boat to another continent and take the hike into the desert to track it down.  They know it's attacked a few cities; they go to one and search the ruins for trinkets before finding a trail of ichor leading them into the desert.\n\nIn the desert, they set a trap to lure the worm to them.  When it appears, they enact their proven strategy of \"destroy enemy by having the Monk get eaten\" (it's shocking how often this strategy worked out for them).  \n\nThe battle is long and fierce, the Cleric nearly dies; but in the end, the party kills the worm, leaving behind a 60 foot tree growing through its corpse, providing a permanent living monument to their success.\n\nI should rephrase: the party kills the worm, unfortunately without (yet) discovering the Dominate Monster that had been cast on it, and leaving a permanent living monument to the pitfalls of working with Evil.\n\nBecause unfortunately, it was at this point Sarenrae and Iomedae became irrevocably displeased with their servants.  Mistakenly signing the contract was one thing; everyone errs, it is how you respond to that error that defines your character.\n\nEven more unfortunately; killing on behalf of an Evil master is one of the few actions explicitly called out as Evil in the rules.  The next time they prayed to their Gods, the emptiness of their commune proved how far they'd Fallen.\n\nIt was several more contracts before the party uncovered the Adventurer's Guild's secret.",

        "text": "I have known my current group of players for a good while now and became very good friends with most of them (and one of them became my wife) and we all have fun. Except when one of them (let's name him Jim) is around.\n\nJim is not a bad person, but has trouble to understand that roleplay is not just about play master of none giant mutant characters who shrug off anything short of a missile and with enough firepower to raze a city block in one hit. And ESPECIALLY not about rewriting the lore with his own âinterpretationâ (read: shoving mutant creatures, movie and/or videogame rip-off creatures/characters and gore stuff everywhere) of it when the GM stays vague. Jim is also very influenced by shonen imagery and tropes and plays them straight, even if it makes no sense. Examples include martial artists able to take on whole platoons bare-handed and win, everybody explaining their plans or how their mega awesome techniques works, etc. Keep in mind Jim is pushing 40 at the time I write this.\n\nJim GMs on a forum tabletop based on the post-apocalyptic manga [*Battle Angel Alita*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Angel_Alita) (or *Gunnm* in some countries) and recently got under our skin for various reasons, so me, my SO and our usual GM decide to have a bit of fun and create a âtrollâ party on said forum for shits and giggles. We eventually settle for a ***very*** stupid and somewhat competent Waffen-SS Panzer crew. \n\nThis is the adventures of the *Schnappi*, a Panther tank on the Eastern Front of WWII, and his inept crew:\n\n- Adelyne Lindemann, the commander and token legal loli. Short, flat and perpetually angry. Loves to blame her subordinates for everything. Secretly a huge sadomasochist. Fights using a riding crop and her custom-made martial art, the Nazi Fu (which amounts to move like a breakdancer on cocaine while beating people to death).\n\n- Gunther Landers, the driver and token crazy bishonen. Cares only for three things in life: strudels, his German sheperd Blondi (the team pet and honorary radio operator) and Schnappi. Can only talk in ALL CAPS. Drives his tank the way a street racer would drive his car and really likes to crush things with it. Trades his tank for a MG 42 when he has to leave the driver's seat. Still hasnât realized he is the only male in the tank.\n\n- Resi Kruspe, the gunner and token beautiful idiot. Thick in body and in mind, she is the target of her COâs rage and âcreative punishmentsâ more often than not. Prone to forget things (like putting on some underwear) and helplessly naÃ¯ve, but is a decent shot with heavy weaponry and her MP 40. Proficient in only three things: quick reflexes, guns and boobs.\n\nAfter a short intro where we explain how we end up in the world of the manga (summary: in an alternate reality where the US-backed USSR started WWII, we were marching towards Moscow, Gunther decided to ditch the loader and the radioman so he could go faster and ended up going through a dimensional portal), Jim has us start in the middle of a giant junkyard. We drive through buildings and almost everything in our path while yelling about how this \"Soviet forward base\" wasn't on our maps, in a mix of random German words and a badly imitated German accent.\n\nAfter a short shouting match due to Gunther doing his psycho driver routine, Jim sends two bulldozers (which we assume to be secret Allied weapons) driven by cyborg-eye-brain things in order to crush and/or flip up the Panzer. A series of good rolls results in Gunther dodging the bulldozer drones by going Initial D on them, Adelyne disabling one of them by way of flying kick in the cockpit + riding crop to the eye combo and Resi shooing the other away with a few SMG shots. Jim ups his game with bipedal tanks armed with laser cannons and a squad of random cyborg soldiers, including one with a cowboy hat. Now seriously convinced we bumped into a secret testing ground for Allied weapons, we make a run for it. \n\nOne of the tanks manages to punch a hole through ours, driving Gunther crazy. While he jumps out of the tank to make a âheroicâ last stand (including tossing a strudel at the tanks), Resi manages to kill it with a cannon shot while Adelyne finds the man we identify as the coordinator of the attack against us, described as âa hobo waving flags atop a pile of junkâ. The battle gets suddenly interrupted by a rain of smoke bombs while someone orders us through radio to get out of here, which we do alongside a bunch of people dressed in Wehrmacht outfits. And Adelyne gets intercepted by a cyborg disfigured soldier and the hobo. Which Jim claims she recognizes as members of Hitlerâs personal totally-real-and-not-copied-from-Wolfenstein occult SS division.\n\nAdylyne, not really willing to trust the future magic Nazis coming out of left field, snatches the map the hobo was showing her and jumps back into the tank. Despite all of us being outside at one point or another, Jim claims only Adelyne saw a gigantic city-sized object in the sky (actually a flying city). We end up finding some abandoned warehouses where Jim informs us of the names of the giant scrapyard and the flying cityâ¦ And a lot of lore information written on the back of the map, including the fact that owning firearms carries the death penalty around here. How convenient when your party uses a tank as vehicle and two of its members are gun users. As the session ends and we find ourselves with some money (in a purse tied to the map that we, once again, only spotted right now), we plan our next move: rob some people at gunpoint to steal their clothes and blend in the local crowd. Who speaks English. Not 1940s German.\n\nAnd Resi forgot her underwear.",

        "text": "[Link to previous post](https://redd.it/5u38rq)\n\nVentus was tired and yet strangely content as he marched down the mountain path flanked by his new comrades.  It seemed an age since he had last scrubbed a deck or pulled an oar. The freedom was intoxicating! He could do anything. He could run, he could sing, he could climb a tree. \n\nA Tree! \n\nOh, it was wonderful to finally see them up close again. He had vague memories of climbing trees when he was a boy. But those memories were painful, and he did not dwell on them. \n\nHe was interrupted in this musings by unfamiliar sounds from around the bend.  It sounded for all the world like an avalanche had been given voice.  Then another, more human sounding voice joined the chorus. It was battle, and again the time to ponder was over.  \n\nHis new friends beside him, Ventus charged up the road to find a terrifying sight. A knight, clad in well-worn armor was locked in furious battle with a giant! Eighteen feet tall if it was an inch, looming over the valiant crusader wielding a club the size of a main mast.  Without thinking Ventus drew his scavenged Longbow. He was not overly familiar with its use, but had seen enough of it to know the fundamentals.  Sadly, his aim was off, and he missed the giant by at least a hands-breadth.  It was enough, however, to distract the beast though and give the knight a few moments to breathe. \n\nFrom there, combat was joined and his friends entered the fray.  Spells were cast, swords were drawn, and blood was spilled.  Little did we know that this giant was but the appetizer, the main course was coming close on its heelsâ¦\n\nJust as the giant took its final steps, we turned to see an even more unusual sight. Four hounds, led by a large black panther. Followed, it would seem, by their handlers. A dragonborn, a half-orc and others were charging towards us as if we had insulted their motherâs cooking.  Without a moment to breathe, or even a chance to ask why we were being attacked, battle was once again upon us. \n\nThe knight was the first to be attacked with several of the hounds and one of the handlers advancing quickly upon his vulnerable position, close to the edge of the cliff.  Leaping upon the corpse of the recently felled giant, Ventus felt the storm once again swell within him.  With a mighty cry, and a crash like the thunder of the roaring sea in a storm he once again loosed the fury within him.   Hounds fell, the bodies tumbling over the edge like so much refuse. Their master, bloodied but unbowed, advanced again on the beleaguered knight along with the half-orc berserker. \n\nMeanwhile behind Ventus, another segment of the battle was underway. Jaânelle, Heseth and the Friar had engaged the panther, the remaining hounds, and a warrior of some skill.  While he did not witness it himself, from accounts later he found out that the panther was actually a shapeshifted druid!  She proved a formidable foe, switching between her human and animal forms, even taking the shape of a bear.  Ventus found it hard to imagine fighting such a foe. \n\nFinally the battle was over, and the group was again victorious.  Jaânelle was able to briefly question one of the bandits, and their reason for attacking us seemed to be simple greed.  Ventus was confused by this. He had seen such things on the high seas. Certainly his former master had engaged in piracy, but he had not heard of such things on land. Clearly he still had a lot to learn about how the world worked. \n\nOut of the ashes of this conflict, Ventus was bestowed a gift. His teammates, seeing his patchwork armor and scavenged sword and shield, gave him a mighty great-axe that had formerly been wielded by the berserker half-orc.  When he held it, he could feel magical power emanating from it. It vibrated with bridled rage, ready to be released upon his foes.  Ventus could not believe that such a gift would be bestowed upon him, he felt unworthy of it, and vowed to use it in their defense. \n\n\nNext: On to Baldurâs Gate!\n",

        "text": "This is a story that happened in a Deathwatch game I joined. I basically broke the poor DMs campaign in five sessions by applied rule of cool. I was never much of a Space Marine fan, so I asked the DM if I could role up a veteran imperial guardsmen instead. Sure, he said, but your character won't be on par with the other PCs, as they are all Astrates and a mere mortal simply won't be as good as them. No problemo.\n\nSo I rolled up 5-7-Echo, imperial guardsman of the 777th Kriegan infantry regiment 'Wulfclaw'. Fiveseven was a stoic son of a bitch and the regiments resident sniper, as he had a knack for making insane long distance shots. His commissar had even pulled some strings to have an Exitus rifle delivered to the regiment, as he saw Fiveseven as lethal enough to warrant some exotic wargear.\n\nWulfclaw regiment had been stationed on the chaos infested world of Saffar III, holding off the treacherous guardsmen and occasional daemon from the ruins of the city Augustan. Ultimately the regiment was overrun and the command center destroyed - all but for one lone soldier camped in a tower with several crates of ammunition and food. Lacking any new orders and the ability to call for new ones, Fiveseven stuck to his assignment and spent six days taking shots at anyone who was stupid enough to peak out of cover. \n\nEnter Deathwatch company Virgil - lead by captain Balthazar Rex with Daimos Herakles as the resident Devastator, the tactical Marine Johann Zyffar, Apothecarius Kellen Smith and the assault marine Fennrick Soren Cassar.\n\nThe Marines had been sent to capture a powerful artifact for the Ordo Malleus to destroy and were cutting a bloody path through Augustan. They found evidence of a large battle and marched right into an ambush of the cultists who pinned them down between four autogun nests. The Marines took heavy fire but began to kill off the nests one by one when suddenly the cultists started to drop dead, their heads exploding like watermelons.\n\nThe dust settled and on top of a nearby ruin knelt an imperial soldier, clad in black carapace armour and holding a big ass gun.\n\nIntroductions were made and Fiveseven figured, as he was unable to reach anyone in HQ that the Astrates, impressed by his handywork in headshotting heretics, where as much of senior officer as he could find. So he tagged along she they requested him to aid them in their mission as a fire support and scout. They were very reasonable Marines after all...\n\nThe next few days were a grueling mix of tense firefights, brutal marching through a war torn wasteland and guard duty while the savvy Astrates did astratesly things to pin point their target - it reminded Fiveseven so much of his childhood on Krieg, he could almost taste his mothers famed rat-and-irradiated-mushroom-stew.\n\nThey found the heretic responsible for the mess, a crazy Khorne berserker who was charging the McGuffin through planet wide slaughter, and delivered the light of the emperor to his face via chainswords and bolt rounds. Then shit went south.\n\nNot only was there one chaos marine, but a whole fucking Word Bearer warband. They snatched the McGuffin, called in an artillery strike and retreated while fighting off axcrazy cultists and the occasional Chaos Marine. Fiveseven was badly wounded but the Apothecarius patched him up and he soldiered on until they got back to Augustan and walked right into a colossal meatgrinder.\n\nThe imperials had tried to take the city, but the cultists, lead by another friggin berserker, had soaked the scorched streets in their blood. Now, this fucker wasn't your regular berserker, but a chosen champion of Khorne sent ahead with a fuckload of cultists to cut of the Marines retreat. \n\nThey were forced to take cover in an abandoned fortress and quickly fortified the fucking fuckity fuck out of the thing - turned out good old Balthazar was a Tech Marine. A bolter wielding, high level Tech Marine. It came down to a stalemate. The Marines and their Kriegan sniper were pouring lead, freshly plundered from the supply depot of the fortress, into wave after wave of cultists, the imperial guard was shelling the shit out of Augustan via basilisks and Khorne was probably spouting a two-mile-hardon thanks to all the carnage.\n\nTech savvy Balthazar fixed some comms and called in an evac and it looked as if the gang of valiant imperial badasses only needed to hold out a few more hours... when the champion of Khorne walked out onto the field, laughing while he was riddled with bullets, rose into the air and transformed into a motherfucking greater daemon of Khorne. This was the first time Fiveseven stopped shooting to look at the mess and mumble 'fuck'.\n\nThe daemon began to chew away the defenses while all around the cultists where chanting blasphemy and heresy. The team met inside the fortress main bunker to discuss just how fucked they were. They reached the consensus that the fuck could be quantified as tremendously. \n\nThe daemon broke through the walls and began to walk towards the last line of defense. The Marines were almost out of ammo and most of the team were pretty beat up, so facing the daemon was out of the question. They also needed to get the enemy out of the fortress, as the thunderhawk couldn't land there as long as that big dick was rampaging around. Using the emergency exit was also a shitty idea, as they then would have to find a new landing zone and by the way, how are you supposed to outrun a daemon the size of a small skyscraper?\n\n\"Give me all your frakk grenades.\", Fiveseven said calmly.\n\n\"Lolwut?!\", replied the Space Marines\n\n\"Your frakk grenades please, I'll try to buy you time and you get the McGuffin to the inquisition. One soldiers life is not worth so much as to endanger the mission.\"\n\nSo, out of the bunker came Fiveseven-Echo, six belts of Frakk Grenades strapped to his chest, a live one in one hand, his Exitus in the other. The daemon was thrashing the last of the bolter turrets and looked at him and chuckled.\n\n\"Eat me, you coward!\", Fiveseven yelled.\n\nThe daemon was like: Nope.\n\n\"Fucking eat me you tainted motherfucker!\", the Kriegan yelled again.\n\nThe Daemon, totally not falling for this shit, decided to go for the bunker and leave the puny mortal to the cultists streaming through the breach. Frustrated that his plan didn't work, Fiveseven took a shot at the daemon with his exitus.\n\nHe just more or less aims for the head and fires. The high explosive AP round flies at a perfect angle, this one in a million trajectory, hits the daemons eye, breaks through the bone of his skull into his brain and detonates. \n\nOur rule of cool was, you get a 100 on a crit, your target dies, no questions asked.\n\nThis tower of flesh and distilled hate just stops mid-stride as the back of his head explodes in a red pulp and slowly falls over backwards. The Marines jaws drop in unison and, somewhere in the warp, Khorne leans forward on his throne and roars a 'WTF?!'.\n\nThe DM takes about twenty pages, crunches them to a ball and throws them into the trashcan before giving me the finger, the puny mortal had just oneshotted the BBEG of his campaign.\n\nA bunch of cultists are squashed by the falling daemon and the rest flees in terror as Fiveseven starts throwing his abundance of frakks at them, killing a few dozen of them until he's back at the breach and just tosses belt after belt at them. At that point the enemy force goes into all out gtfo mode and leave.\n\nAnd thus ends the tale of Fiveseven-Echo, the meanest motherfucker ever to crawl out of the irradiated catacoms of the Deathworld Krieg.\n\nThe Marines were extracted and Balthazar punched the IG lord commander when he demanded his dirty deathworlder to be returned to him. Fiveseven was formally attached to Virgil squad, mostly because nobody wanted to argue about this with five angry veteran Space Marines who had decided the guy was now an honorary battle brother.\n\nAfter the course of two campaigns he was allowed to retire as a sniper instructor for a special forces training facility on Terra and lived a happy life in his private Kriegan quater/unused closet on the holy homeworld.",

Ad we travel around we encounter a giant, even though it probably out leveled us 3 fold, we decided to take it out using tactics. We have Urgha climb a nearby tree while Eric hides behind one 5 meters away. I use light to attract the giant to the tree. \n\nThis is when it goes to shit.  \n\nWhen the giant is under the tree Urgha rolls to jump on its head and start bashing it's head, and Nat 1. GM declares she falls face first on the ground right besides the giant. Eric, who attempted to shoot his hand crossbow also rolls a Nat 1 and shoots himself in the foot and is now half health. Wizzle realizes the plan failed so I now use my light and plenty of screaming to lure the giant away from my allies. Luckily I roll 15 and manage to distract him.\n\nWhile Urgha gets up, Eric fires his crossbow a second time, and what do you know, Nat 1! At this point were all laughing cause he literally shot himself twice in a row. He's at 1 hp and is bleeding out, and I'm running blindly through the forest trying to distract the giant. I manage to hide in a fallen tree trunk, while I use more magic to set the giant off into the distance while Urgha is desperately trying to bandage Eric.\n\nFast foward we recover with no further incidents, we find the remains of a burned down orphanage, while searching we find a doll and a little elf girl (about 3-5 human years) who is unconscious in a trap door cellar. So deciding we need to get her back to town we head for lights off in the distance with her on Urgha's back. We make it their at nightfall with a bunch of clergymen standing in the square. \n\nThese douchebags (ok maybe they were right but still) got really angry with us cause they recognized the girl as an orphan. Starting to say they burned it down for a reason and blah. We were shocked and upset, and I having failed the diplomacy check, decided to get really steamy mad when we hear growling coming from the child.\n\n She was a freaking werewolf, so the clergy man panic and lock themselves in the nearby church. Leaving us stuck with a tiny werewolf on our backs. I use magic missle, while Eric tries to rip off the damn kid off the barbarian's back. But Urgha rolls a Nat 20 and throws the child thing through the church door, causing her to unhappily rip the shreds out of the church leader she landed on (GM informed us) we decide any one who burnt down an orphanage deserves to be killed and we waltz right out of town. \n\nThe GM says we basically killed the main quest giver and ruined any chance of becoming friends with the townsfolk, in the main hub. So he says the quest is over and we can restart on a different adventure later.",

        "text": "In my first pen and paper game (a modified Exodus set in the fallout universe), we got a little crazy.\n \nThe game was set in a post-apocalyptic Reno and surrounding areas.  The group consisted of three characters, Robb Gunn (played by myself), Pundi (played by Myphon69), and Zenneh (played by Zenuion).  Hereâs some background information on the world that the GM gave us:\n\nReno, known in the Wasteland as the twin towns displays a segregation of the high class and the survivors of the Wastes. The town has two districts, New reno and Outer Reno, separated by a fifteen tall wall that surrounds New reno and contains only one point of entry with a high-security checkpoint. New reno consists of high-class living and requires a citizen license or the invitation from a high councilor or Overseer of Reno in order to enter past the high-security checkpoint. No weapons of any type or heavy armor are allowed in New reno and must by forfeited upon entry at the Security Locker. Four Trans-Genetic Mutant guards are on duty at all times to enforce the laws of entry into New reno. Outer Reno is the complete opposite of New reno. Outer Reno is a scum pit of the destitute, low class, and wasteland warriors attempting to get a license to move on to a better life. Many wasteland merchants and scavengers have set up shop just outside the New reno checkpoint, creating a tenttown bazaar skirting the wall. Ramshackle housing can be found circling New reno in all directions for a least a mile. This housing is built from the remains of the buildings that once stood before the bombs.\nOne building remains in Outer Reno with faded paint on the bricks stating to those that can read it âSerpentâs Pit.â The Serpentâs Pit is Renoâs only bar, and an interesting cast of characters are normally found there no matter the hour. The Pit is run by Charlie Daniels and his posse and has the finest booze and water north of Vegas.\n\nFrom here on out, this will be written from the perspective of Robb Gunn.\n\nI was born and raised in New Reno, and a former New Reno law enforcement officer.  I was itching for an adventure out in the wasteland, the real wasteland.  I wanted to be a man. So I left New Reno, and went to the Serpentâs Pit in Outer Reno. I met Pundi and Zenneh at the Serpents Pit.  Pundi was from one of the tribes around the area, and Zenneh was this 18 year old girl who could snatch your caps out your pocket before you could tell her you wanted to take her home for the night.  We all quickly became adventuring partners.\n\nWe saw a wanted poster for a group of Raiders led by a man named âBlackbeardâ track down.  Apparently he had been harassing the Reno merchants for quite a while.  There was a bounty of 500 caps for the head of Blackbeard, and a bounty of 50 caps for the head of every other member.  Zenneh and I wanted the money, Pundi just wanted the adventure.  We took the bounty.\n\nAfter going to the wrong location, and a brief run in with a Brotherhood of Steel caravan where Zenneh met a girl who wanted to hook up with her, we finally reached the caves where the raiders were last seen.\n\nZenneh and I set out to find which cave the raiders were in while Pundi stayed behind to trap a wild coyote to use as a distraction for when we found the raiders.  I eventually found the cave. A raider walked out to take a piss.  Now, I was never interested in a woman back in New Reno, nor a man for that matter, but this raiderâ¦ this beautiful raider had a handsome member, and I couldnât keep my eyes off it.  Eventually, the raider walked back in the cave, and I slapped myself out of my amazement, and made my back to the base camp area to tell Pundi of my discovery and wait for Zenneh to come back so we could attack.  While I was gone, Pundâs trap had worked! Except that he captured a giant ant instead of a coyote.  No problem, we could make it work.\n\nApparently, giant ants are hive mind creatures, and three other giant ants soon showed up to liberate their comrade from the chains (well grass rope) that Pundi had trapped it in.  Pundi and I decided to trap two more of them, and fight the third.  We trapped the two ants, and then surprised the third ant. I misfired my gun and hit Pundi.  I thought Pundi was about to kill me, and Iâd never see the bounty or that raiderâs handsome member ever again.  Lucky for me, Pundi took his anger out on the giant ant and the son a bitch ant died after Pundi punched it one time in his rage.\n\nAt this point Zenneh came back, and we told Zenneh I had found the cave of raiders.  As we got our plan together, I remembered reading about a battle in Ancient Rome, where the king of Macedonia invaded Italy with elephants and the Romans took a beating. The Romans took pigs, greased them up, set them on fire, and sent them towards the elephants, completely destroying the Macedonian army.\n\nI thought if it worked for the Romans, itâd work for us against the raiders.\n\nI told Pundi and Zenneh of my plan to set the gaint ants on fire and send them towards the raiders.  Pundi and Zenneh approved.  In order to distract the guard from seeing us set the giant ants on fire, we planned to throw some spoiled meet at the guard and then set ants on fire and sent them in.\n\nWhen we got to the cave, I spotted the same raider who had pissed earlier guarding the cave.  Except he wasnât guarding, he was pleasuring his handsome member.  I really wanted it, but knew it would be the death of me. I stopped thinking about it, and went ahead with the plan.  We threw the spoiled meat at the beautiful raider, and it hit him in his face and chest, knocking him over.  We lit the giant ants on fire, and sent them in the cave.  The guard caught on fire and died shortly thereafter.  The giant ants bashed the barrier to their cave camp down, and continued on their rampage.\n\nWe heard screams for an hour.  We stood outside the cave in silence.  It was horrendous.  Iâll never forget those screams.\n\nWhen the screaming stopped, we walked in, and found everything dead.  All 8 raiders and the three giant ants.  We took out a whole raider camp without firing a bullet or throwing a fist.\n\nWe looked around, and the Blackbeardâs dead body was nowhere to be found.  We found a note that said âsee you later at North Chapelâ signed by someone named âSâ.  We decided to head for North Chapel...\n\n\nHey guys, thanks for reading the narrative of my character, Robb Gun.  If you want to hear more of this adventure (which although, does not include giants ants on fire, includes other shenanigans) let me know!  We play every monday, and Iâve left out the last half of this adventure so by the time I get around to typing more, Iâm sure weâll have more crazy adventures.\n\nA side note, my plan which took me 2 minutes to think of caused the GM to math for an hour figuring out the damage done.  Eventually, he said âfuck itâ and declared everything in the cave dead.\n",

        "text": "The game is Alternity, and we're playing in a tweaked Star\\*drive setting with no aliens. If you picture Firefly, but with a slightly higher biotech level and the ships going interstellar instead of all the action happening within one system, you've got a decent picture of the setting. Our group is a down-on-our-luck freighter crew that's hugely in debt and constantly taking on semi-legal jobs in an effort to stay afloat, again, rather like Firefly.\n\nThe game ends up taking us to a colony world that's moderately rich and styles itself after Japan. We get a tip from a guy we sort-of-know about '*nisei wafu*,' a kind of crazy clam that gets harvested offworld. Apparently, the locals will pay ridiculous sums for them. We're talking $20k or more per clam. And this guy offers us a the location so we can harvest some. It's a backwater planet with hardly any human presence that's kept secret to keep the supply low. We fly out there to pick some up for what we have been assured is a milk run for huge money.\n\nWe get there, and the first thing we find out is that the planet is entirely ocean, with seas that hover around 95 degrees Celcius. The cyber'd up 8ft. mutant spacehand immediately starts muttering to himself and rocking back and forth. He comes from a line of mutants initially used as park attractions and has a built in crippling fear of deep water and oceans in general. Our catgirl engineer decides that she better get to work on converting the fish tank we brought along to a hot water tank so that the clams don't die enroute.\n\nStrike one, info broker.\n\nSo we hover over a shallow part of the ocean, and send our ~~highly illegal AI-run powered armor~~ diving suit down to fetch some clams. The diver says she's pretty sure she's found them after she gets down to a depth of 70 meters or so and roots around in the mud. But they're kinda big.\n\n\"How big?\" we ask.\n\nHer response is unsure. \"Like, a car? Maybe two cars stacked on top of each other?\"\n\nStrike two.\n\nSo now we've figured out the 20k per clam thing makes perfect sense for several tons of meat and oversized shell, and we're not going to come out of this as millionaires, but with two or three clams we can still come out of this with some profit. The engineer gives up on modifying the fish tank - it's not big enough to hold even a part of a clam. We figure we'll just scoop up some water and flood the cargo bays for the trip back. Maybe rig up a heating unit. We'll be fine. We tell her to grab one and hold on, we're activating the winch to pull her up.\n\n\"Okay, guys? I think it's mad. It's biting me. Oh. The other ones might be mad too. They're all swimming after me.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nThe suit bursts from the water holding onto an ocean nightmare. It's as big as a car and it's gleaming black shell is covered with barbed hooks and spikes. It works the shell repeatedly, denting the suit's armored hand as it 'bites' it. As it flops onto the deck plates it vomits up a string of red pearls, before a muscular tentacle covered in barbed suckers uncoils from inside the shell and the whole monstrosity starts hauling it's massive bulk toward the rest of the crew. The spacehand goes catatonic at the sight of every one of his irrational fears about deep and open water being validated.\n\nSTRIKE THREE MOTHERFUCKER, WE NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUT.\n\nThe crew in the cargo hold scramble to get their frozen compatriot out the door, managing with a lot of shoving and screaming to get everyone into main body of the ship, locking the vacuum door behind them. Our cheerful ~~battle armor AI~~ dive suit operator is stuck in the cargo hold with it as we maneuver the ship to scoop up some seawater to keep this monster from dying. The Captain is kind of unhappy, but hey, even if it's some kind of nightmare monster, it had some pearls right? Giant pearls are worth money.\n\nThen we get a call from our diver. She reports that âIt's biting is somewhat playful, but you probably shouldn't come in here. It's secreting some kind of toxin blend.â\n\n*What?*\n\nâOh yes. My chem sensors are picking up at least two different neurotoxins and a Class IV necrotoxin. Also some kind of unknown nerve agent? I might need to upgrade my chemscan software to identify this.â\n\n**What?!**\n\nIs this some kind of 4 ton fugu? People can't eat this, right? We decide we better make sure that we picked up the right clam. We get on the radio and contact the one outpost of civilization on this planet, a research station halfway round the globe.\n\nOur ship's doctor leads off casual-like. \"Hey, we've got this thing onboard that we thought was some kind of delicacy, can you tell us exactly what it is?â\n\nâUhh, sure I guess. Kinda boring out here. Want to transmit an image or describe it to me?â The radio operator is surprised to be hearing from anyone, really.\n\nWe send him the feed from the suit's camera. The clam is currently clamping itself around the suit's arm, while the tentacle flails about, scratching up the armor but otherwise not doing damage.\n\nWe hear the sound of breaking ceramic over the radio. âHOLY SHIT! Did you seriously pick up a Rike's Lamprey?! Get it off of your ship! Those things are toxic as all get-out and strong as hell!â\n\n\"Oh. So nobody eats these...?\"\n\nâFuck no! You guys picked it up in the water column, right?â\n\n\"Nnnnnooo? We dug it out of the mud.\"\n\nâJesus Christ, it's got eggs then! Red pearls? Jettison the whole pod, it's the only way to be safe!â\n\nThe captain's face is ashen. The door thuds as the lamprey's tentacle hammers on it. There is no way we are getting out of this with any money at all. We can't afford to jettison the pod, as that cargo capacity is what keeps us in business, and also because a lot of our spare hydrogen fuel is in there. We come up with a plan. We'll hit orbit, jettison the water and lamprey, and then clean the whole room in vacuum suits. Maybe let the suit do it without even popping the door.\n\nWe hit orbit and open the main cargo bay door, venting the lamprey out into space and flash boiling away the water. We breathe a sigh of relief and congratulate each other on getting rid of the thing.\n\nThen the engineer pipes up from sensors. âGuys. The, uh... lamprey is maneuvering.â\n\nThe lamprey is emitting jets of compressed air from it's siphon and is madly thrashing back towards us, intent of murdering us for the grievous sin of having tried to end it's horrible existence. Hard vacuum is only an inconvenience to it, and it flails a muscular tentacle at us in rage as it puffs slowly toward the ship.\n\n**WHAT!?** DEAR LORD, *WHY?!*\n\nIt spins angrily on its axis, a fine mist of what are no doubt extremely toxic and noxious substances surrounding it as it approaches.\n\nThis is too much. The Captain gives up all pretense of hiding our highly illegal shit form the new hires, and orders the AI battlesuit to destroy it. The armor sprouts a boxy missile launcher from one shoulder, and fires it out of the open bay toward the flailing horror.\n\nThe missile detonates, and the monster is obscured by an explosion â we wait with baited breath to see if this evil is also immune to missiles.\n\nAs it turns out, it's not, and we end up pelted with toxic lamprey bits which we don't worry too hard about, a since they'll burn up in reentry. However, we have more pressing problems. The entire cargo pod has to be cleansed of toxins. Easiest way is to heat treat it, but a lot of our spare tanks of fuel are in that bay, and the temperature required to heat the room to is... well it's above the tanks safety rating and close to the tanks failure temperature. The AI kindly volunteers to hose the room down with it's flamethrower.\n\n\"Can't we decon this without the flamethrower?\" the captain pleads, seeing more money about to flush away.\n\nThe AI is unsure. âWell, I don't even know what some of these toxins are. High heat should denature them all though. It's really not safe to come in here otherwise.â\n\nWe only lose half our extra fuel in the ensuing series of explosions.\n\nThen comes the final indignity.\n\n\"Where are the pearls, AI?\" asks the captain. \"The string of red globes that it spat out when it came aboard.\"\n\nâAh.... they washed down the maintenance drains.â\n\n\"Okay. Engineer, where do those drains go?\"\n\nâInto the water recycling system. Secondary reactor coolant &amp; grey water heating...â\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" The captain pinches the bridge of his nose. \"You meant to tell us that that crime against existence, the proof God hates us, its eggs are now in BOILING WATER? THE PERFECT FUCKING ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO LIVE AND HATCH IN?!\"\n\nâWell, it also has to cool down for use as secondary coolant... so maybe they won't survive?â She looks mightily unsure.\n\nWe ended up installing gun racks and holsters in the galley and in all the toilets and showers, fearful that a tentacled horror could pop out in a vulnerable moment.\n\nEpilogue:\n\nWe end up back on the wannabee Japan planet. The FIRST thing we do is track down the contact who gave us the info for this run.\n\nHe gives us a wide grin. âHey buddies, I bet you're rolling in dough from all those clams, right?â\n\n\"No. No, we most certainly are not.\" Our captain replies flatly.\n\nâOh well, cant win them all right?â\n\n\"We're winning this one. You owe us $80k.\"\n\nâWhat? That's crazy, I'm not paying you.â\n\nThe captain leans over the table and stares our contact in the eye. \"Yes. Yes you are. You sent us to a world with boiling oceans full of monsters for a food product that doesn't exist. I have a toxic, exploded cargo bay which you will pay for.\"\n\nThe captain indicates the 8-foot mutant space hand, who has obvious dermal armor &amp; cyber muscles and functions as our ship's loadlifter. \"My spacehand here is from Alu. You know how much they hate the ocean there? And that's before taking into account that the planet you sent us to had oceans so hot as to scald skin. Or the fact that the ocean was full of literal monsters, poisonous horrors no man should ever see. If you don't cough up the cost of fuel, repairs, and suffering on the part of my crewman here, I will let him take his frustrations out on your person. Choose wisely.\"\n\nOur 'informant' locks eyes with the slab of muscle that arm wrestles power armor for fun. He reluctantly coughs up the dough.\n\nThe captain used the money left over after repairs to take the crew to a restaurant, and ordered some actual fucking *nisei wafu*, just out of curiosity.\n\nIt turned out that the locals just use the term to mean 'made in Japan.' We got frozen sushi that had been shipped to the colony from it's weeaboo motherland.",

The mods gave their okay for this ad.)*\n\n\nI want to introduce to you a new subreddit I created: /r/collabStories. The concept is simple: Collaborative Storytelling, (almost) like your typical round of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The idea is not mine. I am only trying to bring something from the corners of 4chan to the bigger audience here on reddit. The board on 4chan is /qst/, if you want to check it out.\n\n\n*If you want to see instead of reading, I started the first story on the sub already, so you can simply check that out as well)*\n\nThink of the sub as advanced âChoose your own adventureâ style stories. The storyteller (OP) sets the scene and leaves important decisions to the readers. This can be supported by rolling dice (shoutout to /r/rollme). Readers comment how they would like to advance the story by upvoting comments or making their own.\n\n\nThe concept is simple, but it is amazing what a good storyteller and the crowdsourced creativity of the readers can create. \nI would be super happy to see some people over on /r/collabStories. Especially in the beginning I will try to start a range of stories myself, but I am not the greatest storyteller. I hope some of you find the concept as exciting as I and start their own stories.\n\nIf you guys have any questions, want to help growing the sub or have suggestions, just pm me or ask here.\n\nThanks for reading and see you on /r/collabStories.\n",

        "text": "Last time, I told the story of Trith falling in love with a demon and giving my DM a new reoccurring character, along with Trith falling through a stone floor then himself becoming stone.  Today's story will cover Trith being punched by an old man, a burning building and a conspiracy to ruin a festival about bread.\n\nAfter Sven got away, the party proceeded up the stairs they had found to discover they had wandered into a massive library.  Seeing as this was a very magic and education world, this was the most books Trith had ever seen in his life in one place, and he was suitably impressed for about 5 seconds before becoming bored and wandering off.  While on his \"strategic scouting\" he found an old man who appeared to be dead, slumped in a chair.  Assuming the worst, that Sven had killed the poor old man, Trith ran to the corpse and attempted to inspect it.  However, the \"corpse\" had just been sleeping, and upon being woken up by a smelly, bloody stranger grabbing him, re responded in a very reasonable manner, and smacked Trith in the face.  He of course crit and knocked Trith out cold, then wandered off to speak with the rest of the party who were attracted by the sound of Trith getting the taste smacked out of his mouth.\n\nSome boring plot stuff happened, Trith woke up and the party finally returned to their mission of finding the governor.  Which they did, with no further adventures somehow!  What followed was a big long discussion on the nature of the Plot Coupons, large perfectly round spheres that may or may not be destroying all life on the planet, but as that is not as entertaining I will leave it at that, and might make another post later about them.\n\nHaving found the governor, the party was sent back to the big city to make sure there was nothing dire that needed fixing.  Along the way however the party set off to a small town to rest for the night, only to discover the entire town being empty except for a shitton of undead.  Rolling up his metal sleeves Trith ventured forth and met them in great battle, which was mostly him hitting things with a Halberd while the Rogue shot things and killed zombies, and the Druid cast things and killed skelingtons.  After defeating the undead horde the party advanced through the town in search for the reasoning behind all the dead things, and found a single house on fire, with what sounded like a small girl trapped inside.  Trith sprung into action (because even though he was a jerk, no one is so much a jerk as to leave a small girl to burn to death) and ran into the house while still wearing all his armor and carrying all his weapons, made mostly out of wood because Trith does not have time for your logic when there are things to do!\n\nCompletely unknown to the party, and especially Trith was that they were not the only friendly adventurer in town, and in fact a Human Cleric had arrived shortly before them.  He had also seen the burning building, and had run into it from the other direction.  By the time Trith had heroically burst through the front door and run up the stairs towards where he thought he had heard the girl, the Cleric had ran out the front door with the small girl and ran into the party who were in the midst of their own little melt-downs (neither did well with fire.)  The party was able to explain to the nice person that their dumb friend had run into the building in search of that little girl, and would you please be so kind as to go let him know he does not have to be in there?  So the Cleric sighed a sigh of disappointment (this would become a running theme for Trith and the Cleric's relationship [surprise the Cleric was a new party member]) and ran back into the burning building.\nMeanwhile, Trith was having no luck finding the little girl, and the house was quickly collapsing around him.  Deciding that it would always be his fate to be a giant fuck-up, Trith jumped out the second story window to minimize the odds of the house falling on him.  He managed to NOT land on any of his party members nor the little girl (who Trith was slightly confused to see) and had to following conversation.\nTrith:  \"Ok, good, I hope no one else is in that building.\"\nRogue: \"What about that Cleric guy?\"\nTrith: \"...What Cleric guy?\"\nDruid: \"The Cleric who ran in after you to let you know no one was in the house anymore!\"\nTrith:  \"...\"\nRogue: \"...\"\nDruid: \"...\"\nHouse: *Collapse further*\n\nSo there Trith was, once again running into a burning building to rescue someone he did not know the location of, except this time the other person would be wandering around and time was even shorter.  After a few moments the two men found each other and began to run out of the flaming building together only to find that their path had been blocked by flaming debris.  Trith however had had enough of this shit and decided that if he could not find an exit nearby, he would MAKE one damnit!  He proceeded to kick a hole in a wall, pick up and throw the Cleric through said hole, and jump through himself, just in time to miss having several tons of burning wood fall onto his head.  Trith felt good for the first time in a long time, up until the house fully collapsed from the hole in the load-bearing wall Trith had just made right on top of him.  \n\nAfter being dragged away from the rubble by his new teammate the party discovered that there were some survivors in the town who had holed-up in the tavern.  They learned from these kind folks that a mysterious man in a cloak had gone up to the local crypt a few days back, and when he had returned was when the undead had come streaming forth, slaughtering and murdering their way through town.  The party discovered that in the main chamber of the crypt there was a large indent in the wall where it looked like one of the Plot Coupon spheres would fit, which was verified when the Cleric tried to stealthily check it with his own Plot Coupon but failed miserably.  Finding that the party had a lot in common, ie they knew what the hell those things were... kinda a pact was formed to help and support each other until the mystery was solved, or they all were dead.\n\nThis was tested almost immediately when Trith was approached by some mercenaries that had assisted them earlier in the campaign, coming to recruit Trith into a sweet gig.  Said sweet gig was to disrupt a special feast that was to occur in a few days, where the local branch of a global church was to give away bread to the poor.  Said disruption entailed killing lots of poor people, so that others int he group could infiltrate the temple and find a Plot Coupon they were certain was there.  Problem was, said Plot Coupon was in the possession of the teams Cleric, as it was his church the Merc was trying to hire Trith into attacking and to top it all off, the rest of the party was currently in said church making bread for the feast, so Trith had no way to warn anyone of the upcoming attack.\nSo Trith did the only thing he could think of, and suplexed the mercenary.\n\nTune in next time to hear the story of how Trith got his ass kicked, how Trith got his ass kicked again, how Trith made a stirring speech then got his ass kicked, and then fell off a building.

        "text": "This story starts with a rag-tag party of mercenaries who were sent to rid the Avo Kingdom, the largest trader of Guacamole on the continent, of monsters coming from a nearby keep. Dixon Cider, the human druid who wants to spread the Cider brand of apple cider to ever corner of the globe. Dae'mon the Tiefling warlock who wants to figure out where he came from. And Jack \"Black Thunder\" Dynamite the human monk who needs to find new recruits for his dojo.  \n    \nAfter slaying the evil at the keep they return to find the city burning and being invaded. They go through the front gate and are imedietly ambushed by 4 demons and their hell hounds. \n    \nThe party, being tired from their previous battle, is completely taken aback by the attack. The first two demons try to go after Jack Dynamite, but are too infatuated by his godly pecs and rippling biceps to do anything. \n    \nNext, Dixon takes a chunk out of one of the demons but it appears to have very little effect.  The next attack comes at Dae'mon who being the small frail one of the group is almost killed by the onslaught. He tries  to fight back with his hellish rebuke spell but soon realizes it doesn't effect this kind of enemy.\n   \nJack Dynamite then, channeling his Ki uses a flurry of blows to bloody one of the demons and somewhat would another. \n    \nThen another demon tries to swing at Jack but again fails to his marvelous physique. \n    \nWhen it is time for Dae'mon to strike he hexes the demon who bloodied him and [while singing to himself](https://youtu.be/1P_BlUY2eF4) smashes one of the demons in the side of the head but it again has little effect. \n    \nThe two demons, who tried to tried to kill Jack previously, turn to Dixon and try to light him on fire, but it barely misses him. \n    \nDixon pays them back by using his Thunder wave to push all of them back from his allies while still damaging them somewhat. Then the two demons near Dae'mon, hearing his awful singing and wanting to get far away from it, and try the attack Jack Dynamite who has been kicking hellish ass this whole time. This really bruises him up. But he holds on and takes out 2 demons in the time it takes Dixon to turn into a bee, realize he can't fly because he isn't high enough leveled, hop over to Dae'mon, half dead on the ground, and heal him. \n    \nHowever, in this time, the demons take a chunk out of Jack's mighty afro, and light him on fire. Seeing the danger of being on fire, Jack makes the decision of taking his gi off, exposing his magnificent chest hair. Also exposing a little more than he expected. \n    \nSeeing the dire straights he's in, he uses his \"quarterstaff\" to smack a demon in the face, thus carving a peculiar shape into its face. \n    \nBeing inspired, Dae'mon summons up his power and releases an Eldritch Blast, shaped like a phallus, into the face of the other demon near Jack, decapitating it. They however forgat about the two hellhounds who were preparing for a sneak attack, the pounce on Dae'mon and Jack, taking a sizable chunk out of both. Dixon takes shelter in Dae'mon's pocket while this happens. \n    \nThe final demon, seeing that the party has been split up, goes after Jack, having been abandoned by Dixon. He slashes at him, carving a gash into his chest, sending him unconscious, then the hell hound near him bites him, sending him into critical condition. \n    \nAfter seeing their ally fall, Dixon and Dae'mon slay the hell hound and rush over to the demon. They kill him  and the hell hound with ease, but it's too late, Jack isn't breathing any longer. \n    \nDixon tries to heal him, but it has no effect. As the rains start, Dae'mon screams into the night, asking any good to help. He notices the demon next to Jack is still alive, but barely. \n\"We should question him.\" Says Dixon.\n\"Yeah, I've got a few questions.\" Dae'mon utters as he stands. \n\"You don't fuck!\" He exclames as he punts the demons head over the wall of the city. \nHe kneels down to Jack and promises, \"If the is a heaven or a hell, I'll find you, and I'll bring you back.\" \n    \nHe picks up one of the flyers Jack was handing out for his dojo, \"I'll pass on your legacy buddy.\" They both bury Jack under a Willow tree out side of town and Mourne their friend. As the night grows darker and the rain begins to fall, a blue light emerges from the city. In the cold night, it said in an almost ethereal voice. \n\"Would you like to get your friend back?\"\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "Last time, I told the story of Trith's beginnings and obsessions.  Today I will tell you about the time he made a life-long friend and an life-long nemesis with LOTS of Foe-yay.\n\nAfter waking from his nap and making sure his allies had recovered from the fight, the party decided that they would all head out to find the governor together as to avoid being ambushed by bandits again.  Making decent time and finding the trail of the convoy they were searching for, they eventually came across a bridge that had been destroyed, with only one area nearby hat was shallow enough to cross.  However, far more interesting was the orc corpse sitting there, stripped naked and weaponless. Upon further investigation, however, turned out the orc was barely alive and with Trith having nothing better to use his Lay on hands on, he brought the Orc back to consciousness.  The party discovered that the Orc, whose name was Blackaxe, had seen the Governors convoy pass by only a few days previous.  Blackaxe knew this as he had tried to ambush them, was promptly beaten, stripped of his equipment and left for dead.  Trith decided to have mercy on the poor Orc, made him promise that he would never try to rob people again, and the part went on their way.  This might have been the most plot important thing Trith ever did.\n\nA few hours later the sun was setting, and it was time to set up camp and rest for the day.  During Trith's watch during the night the ground beneath his feet collapsed because life can never be easy, and the party plummeted into a basement dungeon.  Everyone was fine, it was only a few yards down, but the only way out was to find some stairs, as they hole they plummeted though had no easy way to reach for the whole party, aka Trith,  (The druid could have ship-shifted and flown, while the rogue [who had taken a few levels of monk at this point] could have pulled some sort acrobatic tricks) so they only option was exploration. Almost immediately disaster struck.\n\nThe party found a door with all sorts of bones sitting outside so Trith, in his infinite 8 Intelligence, decided the best option was to charge forth and take out whatever the thing inside was before it tried to ambush them!  \"What could go wrong?\"  Trith thought, as he burst through the door, made eye contact with the Basilisk on the other side and was almost immediately turned to stone.  On the bright side, his now stony body blocked the Basilisks field of view so the rest of the party was able to grab Trith and drag him out of the room, while throwing some meat at the Basilisk to keep it occupied.\n\n20 minuets OoG later, a potion of Stone to Flesh was found and Trith was back baby!  The party was able to convince him that going for Round 2 with the Basilisk was a very bad idea, and the party went down the last pathway that was not explored, and Trith once again ran head first into trouble.  However, this time it was not a monster he saw, but the most beautiful man he had ever seen, and he was in love.  The man, who we shall call Sven, told the party that he had also fallen into the pit, and was certain that the way out was through the door just down the hall; however he had neither the strength nor key to get through the door.  Trith was more then happy to try to impress the man with the cute butt and broke down the door.  At this point Sven informed Trith that his party had bad intentions for both of them, and Trith should hold them off so Sven could escape, and the Trith could catch up with him later so they could adventure together!\n\nTurns out, OoC, Trith had rolled two consecutive nat 1s on Will saves against Sven, who was in fact an Incubus, and the DM and I agreed this meant that he was not simply charmed, but was suffering from a minor form of Mind Control; Trith could still make decisions and had free will, but Sven could be very VERY persuasive.  \n\nBack in character, Trith immediately attack his comrades why Sven made a run for it.  The party quickly figured out that there was mind-fuckery in play at the moment, and fought to defend themselves but to also keep Trith alive.  The druid also made their arcana check to figure out the best way to cure Trith was to hit him, as that would give him another saving throw.  \n\nThe downside was, the Druid was out of spells, the Rogue was kitted out for ambushing or long range combat, Trith had a pole-arm and Pole-arm Mastery, meaning anyone moving into melee range provoked an attack of opportunity,  and the kicker was he had Heavy Armor Mastery, meaning that he reduced all non-magical melee damage to him by 3, meaning that if he was hit there was a chance he would not take damage and thus not trigger the saving throw.  Trith was wearing plate and no one had magic weapons, and Trith had no problems getting his murder on.\n\nTrith eventually made his saving throw after taking out the Druid and almost the Rogue before a lucky crit brought him to his senses, but it was too late: Sven had escaped into the world and Trith made a vow then and there to dedicate his life to hunting Sven down and killing him so that he could not hurt another again.\n\nTune in next time where Trith gets knocked out by an old man, buys a horse and immediately loses it, finally catches up to the governor and  runs into a burning house to rescue no one!",

        "text": "Hello all, today I am going to share with you some stories about Trith, the Paladin I played in a 5e game a while back.  Trith was an Oath of Vengeance Paladin, which basically meant that he was a jerk who hunted other jerks.  There was one man in particular who he hated and wanted to murder, but that doesn't come up until later.  The only thing about his backstory you need to know is that he was the sole survivor of a light cavalry squad, who swore vengeance on the officer who sacrificed his squad for his own personal glory. (If any of you have read the Stormlight Archives, I based Trith off of Kaladin a little.)\n\nSo very first session started off with a goblin raid on a small town Trith happened to be passing through at the time.  Luckily, the town had a bit of warning before the raid would arrive, so Trith tried to rally the town's guards into some sort of battle line, only to find that the town's sheriff/mayor was off getting drunk as usual.  Field promoting the closest officer to the new Sheriff (which he had no authority to do, but few people argue with the large angry man with a halberd) and driving off the goblins, Trith then went and threw the sheriff/mayor into the jail to sleep off his drunkenness and inform him that he was no longer in charge.  It was at this point that he discovered that the person he had just promoted was, in fact, the sheriff's daughter but some quick thinking and a lucky Diplomacy roll smoothed out the wrinkles and everything worked out fine.  He then officially joined the groups party which was made up of a Halfelf Rogue who was heavily scarred resulting from a fire burning down their house, and a Gnome Druid, who had a dire fear of fire resulting from their village being burned down.  These were completely separate, unrelated incidents which I think shows quite a bit of resolve from our GM. \n\nSome plot happened, and Trith arrived in the biggest city on the continent where through a series of minor adventures ended up buying 5 pounds of soap, being inducted into the local chapter of the Church of Kord, which was more of a fight club than anything, killing a bandit and getting a REALLY NICE handaxe, and got a stalker in the form of a woman with such poor hygiene that he could not scrub the stench of her from his clothes (see: 5 pounds of soap.)  The party was then informed that the local governor, who we were seeking, had left the city to his estate and thus we needed to hunt him down.  Trith offered to go by himself to find the governor, as he knew how to ride horses and there were places to stop along the way to change out horses, and made it a whole 20 feet out of the town before his Gnome Druid friend got kidnapped!  (She had gone out of the city to pray to her god and was ambushed by bandits, just within earshot of Trith.)  Trith sprung into action, charging down the bandits, fumbling every roll until he was left pinned under his horse.  It was here that the bandits made a vital mistake: they took Trith's handaxe.\n\nLet's back up for a moment.  There are two things you need to know about Trith:  One is that he blames himself for his squad's death and seeks honorable death, preferably while killing a jerk.  The other is that Trith has somewhat severe PTSD which manifests itself in him developing intense obsession over SOMETHING; the thing changes over time.  At this moment, it was that handaxe.\nAt this point, Trith was out of the fight and the session focused on the other party member hunting down the bandits who kidnapped the druid. Whenever the focus would swing back to Trith, it was either him pushing the horse off of himself, or him sprinting through the forest in his heavy ring mail in search of his precious handaxe.  Oh, and his druid friend too, I guess.  He did eventually catch up to the bandits at the end of the fight, just in time to Smite Jerk through his dagger to completely obliterate the final bandit.  Trith then found his handaxe and laid down for a nap, as he had just sprinted through several miles of forest out of pure spite.\n\nTune in next time for the time that Trith saved an orc, got turned to stone and nearly wiped the party!",

        "text": "So my character, Theo Brightmane, is a Half-Elf Favored Soul Sorcerer with the Entertainer(Storyteller) background. Currently we've just barely begun playing OoTA and were sailing down the Dark Lake on a boat our Ranger managed to make from a giant mushroom that functions like wood in the underdark.\n\nWe came across a creepy old lady on a bigger and better boat. We hitched a ride with her instead. While travelling our Ranger fashioned a fishing rod using some of the left over mushroom-wood, stone, and some hairs the old lady graciously gave her. On our travel down river we hit a sand barge. We all disembarked and checked it out. We found an altar submerged just beneath the water on the other side of the sand.\n\nEveryone in the party except my character investigated it. The Warlock decided to touch it and had a small bout of madness that wasn't visible so none of us knew about it. My character went back to the old woman and asked her about it. She came onto the sand and looked. She more or less said, \"Oh it's an altar to a forgotten God, it's only bad if you touch it but the real danger is the altar's guardian.\" aaaaand then she turned invisible(as we discovered later) and went back on the boat. At that moment, the Water Weird guarding the altar grabbed the warlock and yanked her under.\n\nThus ensued a 2 hour (real time obvs) fight during which the wierd tried to pull our fighter under when the warlock escaped. My character had an idea, grabbed the fishing pole from the boat, and attempted to hook the fighter to help pull her onto the sand. First try was a success.\n\nAt the end though our fighter and Eldeth both decide to be heroic and tackle the thing so we can all escape. As we're about to sail away (the old woman reappeared and cast control water) my character does one final toss to try to catch the fighter. I manage to snag her with the hook. The DM then asks me to roll a strength check to keep a hold of the rod as we move away, but I have advantage since Derendil decided to help me. NAT! 20! (Yes I'm aware it doesn't matter on skill checks but shush, it's still exciting.)\nThe DM says that Eldeth manages to grab onto our fighter as we sail away and the Water Wierd stays with the altar.\nFrom this last session on Theo is now known as, \"Theo, Demi-God of Fishing Rods, Hero to All and puppies.\"",

        "text": "There's four evil cults that have sprung up in the area, all of them unwittingly serving a higher power called the Elder Elemental Eye, some kind of evil demigod that's trying to break through to our material plane.\n\nThe players found the Cult of the Black Earth first, holed up in an old monastery, posing as monks. So they go in and wipe them out.\n\nThey make some \"friends\", a group of knights who follow the teachings of a man named Sammular, who died 200 years before. They inadvertently get Sammular's brother, an archliche who lives in the monastery, to raise Sammular from the dead, transferring his soul into the body of this iron golem they've been traveling around with. Sammular hooks up with his knights, and they take off to where the Cult of the Crushing wave is to handle business.\n\nOn their way to meet up with Sammular, they're attacked by a group of cultists riding giant vultures, the Cult of the Howling Hatred. They put them in the ground and head to their base, Feathergale Spire.\n\nOne of the PCs, Creek, is playing an Aarakoca, a bird person. He flies, alone, to the top of Feathergale Spire, while the rest of the party gets ready to party. He challenges the Lord Commander of Feathergale Spire, Thurl, to a dual for leadership. Thurl accepts, and there's an epic air battle between Creek and Thurl, who's flying around on his hippogriff.\n\nCreek's a monk, so most of his attacks are unarmed attacks, kicks and punches and whatnot. He also has a spear. They're flying around this big canyon where Feathergale Spire is, and Creek loses his spear throwing it at Thurl. They seemed to be evenly matched, but Creek has this thing called Stunning Strike, which stuns the opponent for a round when successful. He uses it on the hippogriff a couple of times, sending Thurl plummeting towards the ground. Thurl casts Levitate on the hippogriff, keeping them from becoming a bloody stain on the canyon floor.\n\nCreek crits when attacking the hippogriff, severing it's spinal cord, paralyzing it from the waist down. Eventually the hippogriff is killed, and at the last minute he grabs Thurl, saving his life. He tells Thurl to yield, but he's not having it. He drank the Flavor Aide.\n\nCreek flies high into the air with Thurl, thinking he'll intimidate him into yielding, but Thurl is having a ball. He's never been this high up, and it fills him with joy. Air cultists SMH. Creek pulls an Of Mice and Men and snaps Thurl's neck while he's looking at the horizon. \n\nCreek flies back down to Feathergale Spire. When he arrives, there are four knights, all of them kneeling. Creek asks who's in charge. \"That would be me\" a sexy voice replies sexily, as a beautiful elf walks up the stairs. She has shimmering silvery bird wings.\n\nCreek roles an investigation check, sees that the wings are an illusion. The elf woman, Aerisi, is impressed with Creek and starts recruiting him. Creek ain't having it, and says, \"Why would I follow YOU when you have false wings?\" She's pissssed. She's this spoiled brat who thinks she's a princess, and does not tolerate this kind of thing. Shit's about to go down.\n\nThe rest of the party sees them start to square off and run for the Spire. The drawbridge is being raised and two of them make the jump, grabbing on to the side of the bridge as it's raised. The third PC fails her check, but grabs onto the other player's legs. They roll down the raising drawbridge and make it to the door. The Dragonborn (Vorqrin) easily breaks it down with his war hammer. \n\nInside are two knights, and they're about to attack when the Tiefling Bard, Penny, casts Charm Person to make them think they are friends. It works, and the knights lead them up the spiral staircase that leads to spire. They run into more knights along the way, and convince them that they are emissaries of Creek, who just defeated their Lord Commander. It fucking works somehow.\n\nOnce at the top, Creek continues to antagonize Aerisi. Vorqrin says something to her, provoking her, and she throws her spear at him. This spear is one of the four legendary weapons in this game, and it acts as a key to the lower levels. They don't really know that yet.\n\nCreek attacks with Stunning Strike, and it fucking lands. Aerisi is Stunned. Penny casts Polymorph on Aerisi, turning her into a big fat worm, and catches Wormerisi as she falls. She can keep her in that form for up to an hour.\n\nSo the cultists see their prophet, the great Aerisi Kalinoth, turned into a lowly worm. A GROSS WORM THAT GOES IN THE GROSS GROUND. More than a few of them lose their lunch.\n\nCreek tells them that he's their leader now, and that they need to go on the offensive. He has them all leave to attack the Cult of the Eternal Flame at Scarlet Moon Hall.\n\nThen takes Aerisi high high up into the air and drops her.\n\nSo a note about fall damage. It's 1d6 damage per 10 feet fell, up to a maximum of 20d6. I think that's kind of dumb. I think it should scale more, but that's what the book says, so I decided to go with that.\n\nShe hits the top of the spire at the feet of the other players with a splat, taking 63 damage. She reverts to her true form, and she's at about half her HP now, BUT they were readying an action for when she hits the ground so they get a surprise round before she can get up and do anything. They curb stomp her to death easily, and she dissipates into a howling wind, leaving behind her clothes and jewelry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knights of Sammular get tired of waiting for the PCs, and attack the Cult of the Crushing Wave at Rivergard Keep, killing everyone inside.",

And he might find some terrible monster to slay him along the way - unfortunately for him, dwarves are psychologically incapable of fighting to lose.\n\n**Axel Muffins, Halfling Vampire Hunter:**\nAxel was formerly part of a tight-knit group of scouts in the halfling homeland. His group was nearly destroyed by an encounter with the Arabyan necromancer Dramesh. Axel, the only survivor, joined the caravan in search of new beginnings.\n\n**Rigg D'Elvagar, Human Engineer:**\nRigg is a middle-aged man who grew up in a small village in the northern human Empire. Realizing he had reached his life's halfway point with nothing to show for it, Rigg apprenticed to an engineer by the name of Gregor Friemann, the caravan's resident technical expert.\n\n**Helden Rommstagg, Human Journeyman Wizard:**\nHelden is a wizard who channels one of the eight winds of magic. His wind of choice is Shyish, the wind of death. As the senior apprentice of the Amethyst College, he was sent to investigate the disappearance of another Amethyst Magister by the name of Ludevicus, who vanished hunting down Dramesh. Helden recently found Ludevicus, and is poised to become a Journeyman Wizard soon.\n\n**Nikkel Roklept, Human Cat Burglar:**\nBorn a peasant in the Empire, Nikkel's life was changed forever when his father abandoned the Roklept family, leaving behind a chest containing a stack of encrypted maps and a decoding tool, encoded in an unknown language. Nikkel was able to figure out that his father had headed in the direction of Araby, and joined the caravan to pursue the mystery.\n\nAnd here's the write-up. Feel free to ask any questions about the setting, the plot, or the rules, I'm happy to answer.\n\n***Interlude 2: The White Death and Seaborne Betrayal***\n\n*âGather, brother and sister dawi, and listen well / To the tale of one of our grudges, a loss not forgotten  / A rot-eaten hole in our everlasting realmâs tapestry / Karak Uloft, cradled by scarred mountain, farthest south / Set upon by disinterred dead, corpse-lights dancing in their eyes / Led by the blood-drinker, dwarf-scourger, dragon-tamer, their name lost to timeâ¦\n-First stanza of âThe Dirge of Karak Uloft,â dwarfen song, translated from Khazalid*  \n\nFollowing the Battle of Barak Varr, the members of the 2nd Kraus Expedition made ready to set out to sea. Arrangements had been made for the caravan to travel to far Araby on the boat of Ishtimann Anshaha, an Arabyan ship captain. The main members of the caravan would be setting sail soon, while the refugees who had been trailing the caravan finally trickled north, back into the Border Princes. After receiving the last of their gifts, the party and the other caravan members climbed aboard Captain Anshahaâs ship, the Maidenâs Kiss.\n\nIshtimann was a fun character, a gregarious captain who made very little effort to hide his piratical tendencies. This also marked the first appearance of my terrible âArabyanâ accent, which is basically a mangled Turkish accent.\n\nThe sailors informed the party that their journey to the Arabyan city of Copher would take a quarter-year to complete, assuming the weather didnât prove too detrimental. The party opted to make good use of their time. Nikkel trained his agility climbing in the riggings to help the sailors during the day, and spent his nights learning some of their larcenous tricks â Ishtimann and his crew seemed to have some piratical tendencies. Helden studied the Amethyst Wind with Master Ludevicus, and one cold midnight, on the swaying deck, he was formally named a Journeyman of the Brethren. Rigg learned more of the engineerâs art under the careful eye of Gregor Friemann, and finished the assembly of the rifle he had been building early in the voyage, practicing his aim by shooting at fish and whatever could be thrown overboard without angering the crew. Axel pored over several dusty tomes on the nature of necromancy and the vampyr he had acquired in Barak Varr, his paranoia that Dramesh was traveling back to his homeland and had made allies with vampires growing. Vebur grumbled about not running into any sea monsters, and drank.\n\nAnd the party all advance into their second careers! This is probably most notable for Helden, who as a Journeyman finally gained access to the full Lore of Death, whereas before he had been limited to âpetty magicâ that all apprentices could manage.\n\nOne day, not far into the second month of travel, the boat sailed into a mild storm. Ishtimann assured the travelers that the Maidenâs Kiss could withstand some rain and waves, but did warn them to be cautious â they were off the coast of the Dragonback Mountains, and they had been aptly named. Rumors spoke of a pale dragon that lived there, called Wyruzaki. Veber, surprised to hear his language come out of the mouths of the ignorant, translated: Wyruz-Zaki meant âThe White Deathâ in the dwarfen tongue. Within moments of this clarification, there was a shout from the crowâs nest, a warning â not of a dragon, but of approaching sails.\n\nIshtimann raised his spyglass and inspected the approaching ships. Through the driving rain that was steadily growing worse, the party made out three ships, two small sloops and one large galleon, even larger than the Maidenâs Kiss. Ishtimman informed them that the emblems on their sails indicated they were privateers of Lashiek, pirates sanctioned by the Sultan of All Araby himself. Ishtimann said they had nothing to worry about; he and his crew possessed their own privateerâs license from the government of Copherâ¦although it was strange to see Lashiek ships this far north.\n\nThe great galleon drew up alongside the Kiss. Peering through the spray of waves and rain, the party saw that the other crew were Arabyan, like their own, and didnât seem to be hostile. A gangplank was lowered, and a party of three walked off the galleon and onto the Kiss. The leader seemed to be an envoy or diplomat, judging from his fine robes. He approached Ishtimann and informed him that he was guilty of harboring a fugitive from the Sultanâs justice, one Markus Kraus, the leader of the partyâs caravan.\n\nThe five travelers shared nervous glances. Markus was below decks. \n\nIshtimann began to protest his innocence.\n\nRigg, eyes made keen from weeks of shooting practice, noticed the crew of the galleon begin to reach for concealed weapons.\n\nThe envoy interrupted Ishtimann, proclaiming the sentence to be death.\n\nThe two sloops circling the Maidenâs Kiss pushed out cannons from gun ports.\n\nThere was a deafening bang, louder than the distant thunder.\n\nIshtimann crumpled to the deck wordlessly.\n\nThe party and the crew leapt into action, but the other ships had been ready and moved faster. As the envoy tucked his concealed derringer back into his sleeve and rushed back over the gangplank, his men let loose with a volley of shot, scourging the deck of the Maidenâs Kiss and forcing the crew of the vessel into cover as the envoy made his escape. \n\nThe sloops followed up, firing with their cannons. At first, it seemed they had mistook their aim in haste, firing far above the deck. And then a barrage of chain shot hammered into the masts and sails, crippling the boat as the galleon and the sloops made their escape.\n\nThe now-stranded sailors fired their own guns at the retreating ships, but to no avail. Their boat was stuck in the middle of a worsening storm, and their captain was dead. But they could mourn Ishtimann later â for now, they had to act. The first mate began bellowing orders, to repair the damaged masts as hastily as possible and fetch the spare sails from below decks. The party, forgotten in the rush, hurried to get out of the way and converse with the caravan. Markus expressed his worry that either the chaos cult or Drameshâs vampiric allies had reached Araby, and sent the boats out to stop them. While the prospect was worrying, it did raise one question: why just kill the captain and cripple the ship? The galleon and the two sloops easily outmatched the Maidenâs Kiss â why were they still alive?\n\nThe party had their answer when shouts of alarm rose from the deck above. Rushing out into the sleeting rain and driving gale, the party looked to the sailors to see what was happening. They were screaming in fear and alarm, dropping to their knees in prayer, and lookingâ¦up? The party turned to see what had panicked the hardy sailors so, craning their necks to see a shadowy silhouette break out of the clouds.\n\nThere, in the sky, swooping towards them, was a dragon. \n\n",

        "text": "So we have Mako the Half-Orc Fighter, Tamari the Tabaxi Druid, Remy the Bloodhunter, Reginald the Fighter, and Davik the Ranger. Last 3 all Human. Still all lvl 1.\n \nHere it's important I mention that my 2 veteran players have never looked into CoS nor played any of the campaigns from the previous editions.\n \nLast post end with our party leaving Randall the blacksmith after getting their weapons silvered. They're now finally setting off to track down these werewolves. They do a good job of tracking. Until they get lost... But then they manage to pick up the trail again.\n \nAs the party is tracking I mention that a light fog begins to roll in. Everybody shitting themselves. All ready actions. There's no combat. This is just me getting them into Barovia. I'm laughing on the inside. I describe the fog getting thicker as they keep walking. Reginald decides to light a torch and plant it in the ground. Pretty smart Reginald...\n \n2 minutes of walking later and I tell Reginald he looks back to check the torch and it is gone. Party having panic attacks. So many readied actions. Coming up with strategies on what to do if they're attacked.\n \nFog eventually clears and they realize they're now on a road. I describe that something about this place seems different. Reginald investigates the road. Nat 20. Gives me an eat shit look. Tell him it's dirt. Whole party upset. Tell him this dirt seems to be from another plane of existance. I now know how DM's feel about nat 20's.\n \nParty walks along the road until they get to the gates of Barovia. Remy and Mako stand at the gate watching the road they just came down. Oh shit fog followed them the whole way. Rest of party stealths into the town. I tell Remy and Mako that as the others walk away the fog begins to move with them until they're standing in it. Con Saves. Mako actually passed the DC20 save.\n \nReginald hears his brother gasping and runs back towards him. No more stealth nonsense. I describe the houses they pass as pretty rundown with windows boarded up. They assume they must be empty. They get to an intersection where the fog is blocking all the paths but 1. Party chooses the clear path.\n \nRemy and Mako decide it's a good idea to check 1 of these houses, and I learned the mistake of rolling in front of everyone as a DM. Roll on chart. 20. 2 d4 Strahd Zombies. Fuuuuuuuuh. Roll d4's. 8 fuuuuuuhh. I'm pretty sloshed at this point and made it quite obvious they just fucked up opening this door. They immediately close it and continue down the road.\n \nThey see 2 children crying. Party asks what's wrong and the children tell them \"There's a monster in our basement and our baby brother is still inside with it.\"\n\"Where are your parents?\"\n\"They went to the basement to deal with the monster but haven't returned.\"\n\"Where is the baby?\"\n\"On the 3rd floor up there\" *points*\n\nParty notices balcony on 3rd floor. Tamari and Davik decide to climb the fron of the house to the balcony. Pass their climb checks. Never in all the stories I've read about Death House have I heard of somebody doing this so I'm caught off guard immediately. They ask what they can see through the window. I tell them \"You see what looks like a nursery room being dimly lit by oil lamps on the walls. In front of the crib stands a woman, her back turned to you. You can just barely hear her singing a lullaby.\"\n \nParty immediately thinks this woman is bad news. They now do another thing I haven't seen on the stories I've read. They run into the house saying they're looking for stairs. Stairs immediately to right. They run up said stairs all the way to the 3rd floor. Passing up my offerings of looking around at what they might see. This baby is super important to them.\n \nThat is, until Mako gets to the top and sees a set of black platemail armor standing in front of a wall. See, Mako is already prepared to go Eldritch Knight at level 3. He is also prepared to be the party tank. Suddenly baby saving is less important than 1500gp saving. Plus that sweet sweet AC. He tries to take the plate off the mountings it's on. And gets dropped to 0, which as a Half-Orc means 1. Roll initiative. Armor goes last. And gets dropped by 3 people coming up a flight of stairs. They identify the door toward the front of the house.\n\nAnd that readers, is the conclusion to my 1st session. We're doing these weekly so let me know if you're interested in more. Also I'd like to hear thoughts on how this party handled Death House. They don't even know the names of the 2 kids in the road. But where they left off at gave me some time to come up with some intense horror stuff. 3 party members about to bust into the nursery with 2 outside looking through the window.",

That was until the dire shark attacked and got the sub stuck requiring people to go out and get us unstuck.\n\nThis was the point where the Warforged swalloed his fear and voluntered to go out (being the only person not needing air) to be the achor point for a few Gnomes who were on the crew, and our groups Artificer (can't rembmer his race sorry) and also to help them.\nMean while the two halfings (one Rouge/Sorcerer the other Cleric/Ranger) down some water breathing potions the ships crew had, armed up with watercross bows and went out to fight back the Direshark.\n\nAt first this seemed to be a good plan that was working... that was until the  Dire Shark got close enough to hit the Cleric leaving him bloody, and becoming it's primary target.\n\nAt this point I realized I had left everything inside. My swords, sheilds, throwing weaponry, everything except the warforge compnents built into me were inside, so i disconected the three small characters from me to try and get into the fight against the shark before someone died.\nSo when the Shark (it was a Huge Dire Shark) came by for another pass I tried and failed (No surprise) to grab hold of the shark, though it did piss it off as it refocused on me.\n\nWhen it came in for a second attack I actually succeed but the shark  being 2 size catigories bigger then me (me medium, it huge) I end up going with it, and amd now riding a shark as I punch it. \nThe shark tryed to shake me, but failed. It tried jumping up out of the water, which I decided to hold on (bad idea) which angered it more. Then it went with its best idea, swim straight down. After awhile the depth began hurting me more then I was hurting it and had to abort, at which point it swam round and hit me hard enough to drop me down to the negitives making me Innert and sinking down to the bottom.\n\nSo now Dusty the Warforged Fighter is laying at the bottom of the ocean, far out of reach of anyone, though luckily enough the group was able to kill the shark so it's corpse is laying right next to my fighters so at least he's not alone.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/67xz6p/dd_5e_the_heroically_implausible_tale_of_carric/",
        "text": "**NB: I've not actually played this through with a DM. I was just reading the D&amp;D monster manual the other day, and decided to write a story about a Level 1 Elven Bard who somehow managed to slay a Tarrasque.**\n\n\nCarric grew up in troubled times - the wood elf kingdom was under considerable threat by a gigantic, hulking monstrosity known as the Tarrasque, that was being a grand nuisance, laying waste to cities and gobbling up all the pretty young elven maidens. It was because of this disruption that Carric had had a troubled upbringing - his own mother having been a tasty elevenses for the Tarrasque. By the age of 78 he was already demonstrating worringly antisocial behaviour in school, teasing the other students mercilessly. Eventually, the teachers became tired of his constant harassment, and therefore hastily expelled Carric. Without an education, Carric had no other choice but to join the military, where he learned proficiency with the longbow. In his spare time, he also took up playing the whistle, training as a bard, and came runner-up in several talent shows in his village.\n\nA few years passed, but then on one fateful Tuesday afternoon, Carric heard a sound - a terrible sound that he had not heard since childhood, yet felt intimately familiar to him. The Tarrasque had returned! Determined not to let his hometown suffer the same fate it had all those decades ago, Carric decided to take things into his own hands.  He crept stealthily into the elven military camp, but to his fortune it was already deserted - instead of throwing their lives away trying to fight the Tarrasque, the other elves had decided to round up the townspeople and evacuate. Searching the shelves in the Captain's quarters, Carric found a fine magical longbow and several quivers of arrows - or possibly a normal longbow and several quivers of magical arrows, depending on how ranged magical weapons work. By a stroke of luck, there was still one riding horse left tied up outside - it had evidently been forgotten about in the rush to get out of town. \n\nAnd so, armed with nothing but a longbow and his whistle, Carric rode the riding horse out of town, pushing through the swarming, panicking crowds that were rushing in the opposite direction. As he rode, he wondered why some adventurers chose not to ride horses literally everywhere they went, since they gave extra mobility, and a free dash, disengage or dodge action even if the rider had performed some other action on that same turn. It all seemed too good to be true - Carric hoped that he had learned how to ride a horse correctly, else his entire plan might fall apart and he would surely die. After some time, Carric made his way to a wide plain, with absolutely no difficult terrain in sight that might complicate matters. He rested for a while, conserving his energy for what would undoubtedly be a very long and drawn out battle.\n\nThe Tarrasque arrived just as Carric was halfway through a very tasty chicken and lettuce sandwich. Annoyed, Carric wrapped the sandwich up for later, and mounted his riding horse to face the gargantuan brute. To the Tarrasque, Carric and his horse seemed barely more threatening than a fly - little did it know what was about to happen on that fateful day.\n\nCarric waited until the beast was within 60 feet of him, its lumbering form eclipsing most of the sky as it towered over him.\n\n\"What are you waiting for, you oversized ginger hairbrush?\" Carric yelled. Although the Tarrasque couldn't really understand what was said, the insult seemed to infuriate the beast nonetheless. It drew itself up to its full colossal height, and gave a roar that shook the all the birds out of all the nearby trees. A few miles away, a band of menacing, burly trolls wet themselves with fright, and a grumpy gnome on a distant continent woke up in the middle of his morning nap with a splitting headache. And so, the battle was on.\n\nCarric immediately retreated to a spot exactly 121 feet away from the terrible monster. In response, the Tarrasque moved up to half its movement, and then used its own action to dash at Carric. Its movement was 40 ft, so in total it traveled 20 + 40 + 40 = 100ft, arriving just out of range of Carric - even if it had not used its action to Dash during that turn, it could not quite reach Carric. Even its tail would have fallen one foot short. It could have tried to use its frightening presence, but for some reason that also required an action to use - Carric was completely fine with seeing a gigantic physical representation of his certain gory death standing about 7 yards from himself, and would have only possibly been frightened if the monster had taken its time to focus on pulling a really scary face at him.\n\nAfter the Tarrasque stopped moving, Carric once again retreated, using all his lifetime's experience of being a big bully, taunting the poor Tarrasque as he fled on the riding horse, until there was once again 121 feet of lush, meadowy grassland between his horse and the monster. This time however, the Tarrasque had learned - it used its reaction to move 20 feet nearer, and then used its turn to give Carric the sourest, most despicably evil-eyed stare it could muster. It was all Carric could do not to fall off his horse in fright at this hideously impolite gesture, and for half a minute or so, it looked as if the Tarrasque had gained a cheeky upper hand on Carric. Thankfully, after a few moments Carric composed himself, using what little wisdom he had to reason with himself that, while it was at first a VERY scary face, the magnitude of the fright was rather diminished after the initial shock factor had subsided. In response, the Tarrasque scrunched up his face into an even less affable scowl, but to no avail - it just wasn't doing it for Carric anymore. Had the battle lasted more than twenty-four hours, Carric might have lost his courage after precisely one day had passed, and once again started to quake in his little elven boots at the Tarrasque's grotesque gurning display, but due to the battle lasting not notably longer than the expected amount of time, this did not happen.\n\nOn and on the battle raged - Carric Viciously Mocking the Tarrasque, his insults piercing through the creature's legendarily Reflective Carapace because although they were spells made against a single target, they were not 'line' spells, and used a Spell Save instead of requiring Carric to aim and make a Ranged Spell Attack. The Tarrasque had a high Wisdom Saving Throw (confusingly, since his actual Wisdom Modifier was zero) and his Magic Resistance gave him an Advantage against the barrage of filth spewing from Carric's mouth, but as the minutes turned to hours, the never-ending torrent of hurtful words really started to take their toll on the pitiable scourge of the material plane. \n\nIf it could just catch Carric, the Tarrasque would easily have been able to obliterate his smug face in a single swipe, but always the smarmy little elf was just out of reach of its tree-sized claws. Sometimes, the Tarrasque would seem to give up the chase, standing still - which might have posed a problem for Carric, had he not been carrying the magical longbow (or the magical arrows, depending on how magical ranged weapons work). His horse could move 60 feet in a turn, 120 feet by using its Dash - but since mocking the Tarrasque from more than 60ft away seemed to have no effect (the Tarrasque had probably damaged its own hearing by roaring too loudly), he would have had to dash 61 feet towards the Tarrasque before yelling his insult. His horse would then only have had 59 feet of movement left, coming to a stop only 119ft away from the beast. This would still have forced the beast to use its Dash action in order to close the gap, but Carric did not know whether or not being within 20 feet of the Tarrasque at the start of his turn might provoke an opportunity attack from the beast's tail, or whether the Tarrasque still only had the standard 5 foot reach for the purposes of determining attacks of opportunity despite having an attack with a 20ft reach. \n\nCarric had decided to play it safe, choosing to be born as a Wood Elf so that he had proficiency with the longbow and could therefore still take potshots at the Tarrasque in the moments when it refused to move into taunting range. Otherwise, he might have wished that he had been born as a more charismatic race so that he would have had even more capacity for generating uncouth slurs than he already did.\n\n(Mathsy bit) Carric had 14 Charisma, giving him a Spell Save DC of 8 + 2 + 2 = 14. The Tarrasque not only had +9 to his Wisdom Saving Throw, but also had advantage on any Saving Throws against magic. Therefore, the Tarrasque only had to roll a 1, 2, 3 or 4 on either die to resist the effects of Carric's foul language, and so only succumbed to one in every 25 verbal assaults against its fine, upstanding character (20% ^2 = 4%). Even on the times that Carric DID pierce through the Tarrasque's metaphorical (and physical) thick skin, he only did 1d4 damage to the Tarrasque's psyche - 2.5 damage on average.\n\nAs for the times when the Tarrasque refused to budge - Carric was naturally very dextrous as an elf, and was born into a particularly nimble family. All in all, this gave him 16 Dexterity, and so, with his proficiency in Longbows he had an attack bonus of 3 + 2 = 5 and a damage bonus of +3. The Tarrasque had an armour class of 25, which made it very tough to get a good shot off into the monster's fleshy bits, but it wasn't completely impenetrable at least. Carric needed to roll a nat 20 just to match the beast's AC, but fortunately ties seemed to be good enough - and besides, natural 20's hit automatically. After thinking about this, Carric realised that since proficiency bonus didn't count towards the damage roll, he needn't have been born as a Wood Elf to begin with - if natural 20's really were an automatic hit, he needn't have had the longbow proficiency in the first place. But Carric had already been born a Wood Elf by this point, and although he cared enough to save his kingdom from the Tarrasque in the first place, he really wasn't about to go back and change everything just for a slightly higher Charisma Bonus.\n\nHere, the history books diverge on the topic of how much of the battle Carric spent using his Longbow, and how much of the battle was spent mocking the Tarrasque. The tomes that prefer to paint Carric as one of the finest Elven archers generally tell of a much shorter battle than the ones that portray him as the master of slander. If you are of the belief that Carric mainly preferred to use his bow, then you will agree that with a hit chance of 5% and a damage of 2d8 + 3 (4.5x2 + 3 = 12 damage on average), Carric took approximately 676 / (12/20) = 1,127 rounds or just under two hours to slay the beast. Otherwise, if you believe that Carric preferred to use nothing but his own filthy tongue, then you will hopefully agree that Carric took roughly 676 / (2.5/25) = 6760 rounds or a gruelling eleven hours and sixteen minutes before he finally convinced the beast to give up. Roughly.\n\n(Had he been a more charismatic race, it would still have taken him 676 / (2.5/20) = 5,408 rounds or 9 hours and 48 seconds to talk the beast down.)\n\nDisclaimer: The textbooks may be innaccurate, as although the authors tried to double check their working, there might still have been errors in their methodology, given the poor education of those ancient times.\n\nGiven that most sane witnesses had long since fled the scene, only a handful of Carric's legendary insults have survived to this day. Here are a selection of the most oft-quoted:\n\n\"Can't catch me, you giant lardy lizard - looks like you might've eaten one too many kingdoms!\"\n\n\"You think you're so special? I could take on a whole army of you guys, were it not for the rules concerning exhaustion, your legendary action that allows you to move half of your speed, thereby inexplicably letting you move slightly faster each turn if there were more creatures involved in the combat, up to a maximum of three creatures other than yourself (thank goodness your roar scared away all of the local wildlife), and the fact that only one of you can exist in the world at any given time... so yes, I suppose you are sort of unique in that aspect.\"\n\n\"You know, I thought you might pose a slightly more difficult challenge against me - aren't you supposed to be the most destructive monster ever to exist? If that's really the case, I've gotta say you're not doing a great job of it today.\"\n\n\"Awh, is itty-bitty destroyer of worlds crying? Do you want your mummy-wummy? Aw, diddums.\"\n\n\"I've seen vegetables that look more formidable than you, you big, hairy carrot!\"\n\nAnd thus it was so - after hours of torment and little annoying arrows pricking his skin, the Tarrasque could stand it no more. With one final exasperated roar, the titanic reptile collapsed to the ground, feeling utterly humiliated. Having lost all its will to continue in its pointless and shameful existence, it heaved one last sigh of bother, and expired. After countless armies had thrown all they had against it with no avail, one solitary elf succeeded in mocking the beast to death, henceforth disproving once and for all the phrase \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me\".\n\nUpon realising that the beast was finally dead, Carric suddenly felt a surge of energy wash through him, as he suddenly gained fourteen Bard levels all at once. After the exhausting fight, this abrupt rushing sensation took all the remaining air from Carric's lungs, and he promptly fell off his horse, failing the Dex save and landing prone in a patch of damp grass.\n\nCarric returned to his town victorious and full of pride, holding aloft a goblet of the Tarrasque's saliva (as he did not possess enough strength to cut or carry any more meaningful trophy). Unfortunately, the town was still evacuated, and it took several days for word to reach the fleeing townspeople. Carric spent the next few days looting the shops and throwing eggs at his old teachers' houses, but eventually the townsfolk returned and a feast was thrown in Carric's honour - and what a feast it was!\n\nDespite being level 15 and one of the most legendary bards ever to have lived, Carric gave up the life of adventuring then and there, choosing instead to be an Insufferably Smarmy Git who just Wouldn't Shut Up, boasting of his feats to everyone in earshot all hours of the day. He lived a comfortable life that was tragically cut short at the young age of four hundred and forty six, dying from an acute case of Suspicious Circumstances the day after he had insulted a band of traveling mercenary assassins.\n\nMuch of his story has been lost now to the winds of time, but his story is still told in the halls of every bard's college - Carric, the elf who teased the Tarrasque to death.",

        "text": "So we have Mako the Half-Orc Fighter, Tamari the Tabaxi Druid, Remy the Bloodhunter, Reginald the Fighter, and Davik the Ranger. Last 3 all Human. Still all lvl 1.\n \nLast post I left off with Mako and Davik spotting a werewolf sprinting towards them after tumbling with a weaker werewolf. The last 1 was nerfed for reasons but was still supposed to bring Mako down to 0hp. So this new werewolf charges Mako. Why fix what aint broke? Werewolf immediately grappled. Davik taking shots but doing no damage. Werewolf gets control of the grapple.....and then loses control. This happened so many times I actually moved the characters both over a space and told them at this point they were just rolling around the floor. Mako fails to regain control on his turn after a while so the werewolf finally gets an attack in. Mako at 3hp. Mako's player looks at me and asks if his character thinks there's anything he can do to convince the wolf not to kill him.\n \nWell maybe if you apologize to it. Actually apologizes to werewolf. Roll persuasion. 5. Werewolf knocks him down to 1hp and runs off. Has other matters to attend to.\n \nDavik picks up Mako and helps him get to the town of Crum to recover. On their way they come across a hut just outside the town with a Tabaxi outside watering her plants. Davik recognizes the plants as medicinal herbs. This'll work. Tabaxi seems displeased with random guests but hears about the Werewolf Wrangler. Tamari hates werewolves so offers to help. Davik has some squirrels he killed before running into Mako so decides to walk into town to see what he can get for them. Gets to the local tavern and thats where our story changes to 2 new faces.\n\nEnter Sir Reginald and Remy Lacroix. Brothers. Both members of the Order of the Spectral Blade.  Both complete dicks. Seriously I was caught off guard by how well my 2 friends could roleplay such an arrogant duo. They were sent to Crum to investigate a reported werewolf attack from a few days ago and are now learning that another 1 just happened before they got to Crum. They go to the Tavern to ask around.\n \nR1 \"Brother what manner of hut is this establishment?\"\nR2 \"Brother I believe this hut may actually be the local tavern\"\nR1 \"Dear heavens brother this place is filthy! And the people!\"\nR2 \"Yes brother I've never seen such a group of disgusting faces in all my years!\"\nR1 \"Well no matter, we have business to attend to\"\n(I can't remember the exact words used but it was something like this. I know they refered to all the buildings as huts.)\n \nThey insultingly ask the bartender about the werewolf attacks. Davik is just down the bar finishing up selling his squirrels to the owner. Davik hears the brothers and mentions how he just met a guy who wrestled with 2 werewolves. Brothers claim this is bullshit but ask to meet this man so he may take them to where he last spotted the werewolves. \n \nThey get to Tamari's hut (as they described as the smallest hut in all the land). Meet Mako. Mako tells them about his wrastling of the wolves. Agrees to take the 2 where he last saw them. Tamari volunteers to help track for them. Ranger too. Remy decides to seek payment from the mayor 1st. Yeah all the payment was already sent to their order. Mayor tells party the town blacksmith's son was taken in the 1st attack. Maybe the blacksmith will silver the party's weapons.\n \nParty meets Randall the blacksmith. Thick red beard and mullet. Party tells him they are after the werewolves that took his son but requore silver weaponry. Randall does it for the free under 1 condition. They bring back his boy. Party agrees and now have newfound determination to slaughter these werewolves.\n \n6 hours later Randall and his team of apprentices finish the weapons. A silver spear for Tamaria. Silver halberd for Mako. Silver rapier for Reginald. I let Davik choose to either take 20 arrows or roll 2 d20's to see how many arrows he got. Rolled and got 20 anyway. Remy started with a silver weapon already.\n\nParty heads off to track these werewolves down and i will finish the tale of this session tomorrow.",

        "text": "1st time DM here running Curse of Strahd for 3 newbies and 2 veterans. Don't like the adventure hooks, so I twist the werewolves 1. Create a hook that has the party meet each other in various ways instead of just assuming they're all friends off the bat.\n \nWe have a Half-Orc Fighter, Tabaxi Druid, and Human Ranger as our 3 novice players. And we have a Human Blood Hunter and Human Fighter as our veterans.\n \n Veterans agreed to have their characters know eachother already to make my job easier. Went with making them brothers. Both serve the Order of the Spectral Blade. Witch hunter type stuff. Sent to town of Crum to investigate a Werewolf attack where 3 children were taken.\n\nStory really begins with Half-Orc. He is a hitman working for a contract killer in a city a few miles away from Crum. Handles all his boss's light weight contracts. Assigned to kill an old man on his way to Crum soon. I let the player get a day ahead of the old man's departure to set up an ambush. Decides on the old \"I hide in a tree over the road\" trick. Ok lets go.\n\nOld man comes riding along in a cart pulled by 2 horses. Have Half-Orc roll stealth at disadvantage because armor. Rolls shit. Old man asks what he's doing up in a tree. \"I'm picking apples.\" Ok roll deception. Shit. You're not even in an apple tree bro. Old man decides to try and book it. Whips the reigns and have him roll animal handling. Falls off cart. Half- Orc jumps out of tree and kills him instantly.\n\nNow this player wants to go Eldritch Knight, so I use this opportunity to give him a focus. Old man actually low level wizard. Finds ring on his hand that calls to him in unrecognizable whispers. Puts it on. Now we introduce the werewolves. Hears howling and 3 approach. 2 are carrying kids and just keep going. 3rd looking to eat.\n\nPlayers all lvl 1 so I handicap this werewolf hard. Still should manage to kill the player in 2 rounds of combat or less (which is the goal of this intro). 1st round and he decides to use investigation to see what he knows about werewolves. Knows he needs silver to even hurt the thing. To make the fight not feel pointless to him from the beginning I tell him his ring seems to be silver, so punching might work. Decides to grapple instead.\n\nPlanned for 2 rounds of combat max. This grapple took the fight over 10. Ranger shows up to what appears to be an old man and his Half-Orc bro getting attacked by a werewolf and decides to help. No silver though so arrows being shot for nothing. Half-Orc bro wants to try to rip the things jaw off. Nat 20. Jaw gone. Sees teeth starting to come out the wound over the next couple seconds because wasn't cut off with silver. Half-Orc wants to punch him in what I'm now referring to as the werewolf's \"little mouth.\" Nat 20. Hit's so hard the werewolf flees back to it's friends.\n\nHalf-Orc now boasting to new Ranger friend about how he can fight a werewolf. I explain to the player that I really dumbed down that fight to make him able to get a hit off on the thing. Still boasting. Now sees one of the other werewolves sprinting towards him. This one's stats straight from the book.\n\nAaaaand that's where I'll end this tale for the night guys.",

        "text": "(This is my first time making a post like this, please go easy on me haha!)\n\nBefore the story itself begins, I would like to fill you all in on our PC's.\n\nJonathan Meseeks - Our handsome rogue trader, and my character. He started off as a joke character for a one shot we did, but when that became a full-fledged campaign he stuck. He is remarkably lucky and throws himself in harms way without a second thought, as he always believes he'll make it out fine. He also has a crippling fear of death, which he copes with by slowly replacing all human features of himself with robotic ones. At the time of this story, he has replaced all of his limbs.\n\nChandler Bing - Our resident tech priest, robot voice and all. This is the other character that came over from that one shot I mentioned before. He's handy with tools, never without at least one robot companion, smart, a heretek, and \"was a rotary phone in the 50's\" and \"has seen empires rise and fall, this one will be no different\", and he loves making sure everyone he meets. Needless to say, he's crazy and not very good with people, but we love him all the same.\n\nSteel Viper, or Lambda - A false man we found leading a small crime ring on a desert world. He's ruthless and well-informed, and helped us steal a ship to get off the planet, and has been our Seneschal ever since. He's loyal to the captain, but also scares the shit out of Meseeks, and even though he isn't our official First Officer, he holds remarkable, uh, 'influence' over the captain.\n\nMarcus Aurelius - Our navigator. He's a member of a well-known House, and can be a small celebrity when in the right crowd. Much like Crombopulous Michael, he just loves killing. He adores his Kroot rifle, and uses it at any chance he gets. Also, he hates having it taken away and might react violently if that happens.\n\nDrolis - Our missionary of Drusis. He loves burning xenos, and is never without some way to set things on fire (you can never be too prepared). When we met him, he was labeled as a terrorist on a xenos world, and now he helps us cut down any hostile aliens we might encounter.\n\nMost of us have secondary characters, but since they're newer they are naturally less fleshed out compared to the above characters. The two that might come into play in our story are \"the astropath\" and \"the pilot\", both of which are exactly what they sound like.\n\nNow, on with the story! Our adventure begins with us recovering Meseek's writ from inside the belly of a hydra, and while while we were inside the hydra we found a strange crystal. Flesh that touched it would grow strange growths, while metal would remain unchanged. We were unsure of what it did, or what it was, but it seemed valuable so we took it. To make sure we would be safe to enter the warp with it, our astropath decided to use his powers to glimpse the future. He told us one word: deception.\n\nA bit unnerved, we decided to continue with the crystal and sell it as soon as possible. Until then, we had a job to do. A mining colony needed a transport shipped about 30 days away, and had asked us to deliver it. A basic job, but the job wasn't what was interesting.\n\nDuring the trip, crew members began disappearing. About four in total vanished in a week, and then the disappearances stopped happening altogether. We dismissed it until about a week later, when a mutant appeared in our mess hall, claiming to have been taken by a scientist and begging for water. A hungover Meseeks (who either didn't know or care as to why this was significant) shot at, and missed, the mutant before giving up and going to bed to nurse his killer headache. Viper and Marcus questioned the poor creature until its organs gave out, and then disposed of the body. Nothing important was learned from this.\n\nWhile the mutant was being questioned, our captain was falling asleep in his quarters. He was almost asleep when he heard a creak, almost as if something was approaching him in the dark. He slowly opened his eyes, and his vision went black. A few hours later, he was awake and feeling fine. Meseeks dismissed the odd event as a dream and went along on his normal business.\n\nThe rest of the trip passed uneventfully. We arrived without issue and went planetside to negotiate the price of our shipment. As we were sitting down and getting ready to start, our DM informed me that Meseeks was feeling ill. He stood, and had barely reached the door before bright green vomit began spewing from his mouth. This went on for several minutes, and by the time someone came to help him he was sobbing in his puddle of vomit, with a dribble of the strange goo coming out of his mouth. As soon as his crew went to move him, the vomiting began again. He was dragged back to the ship and was immediately brought to the medbay, where he was stabilized. At this point, my DM had rolled a d5, and Meseeks took 4 toughness damage. He was dying.\n\n(At this point, I'm so tired. Typing all of this took a lot of energy out of me, but I promise I'll finish it soon!)",

        "text": "Hope I'm posting this to the right sub. And please forgive my English, not a native speaker.\n\nThis is a tale from a homebrew campaign I narrated, for 2 players, using a heavily modified D10 system (by us).\n\nThe main modification you need to know, to understand this tale, is the possibility to create any skill. Even if it overlaps with others. Let me give you an example\n\nIn the D10 system, you have the \"security\" skill, that is used for lockpiking but also for other related stuff. In our system, you are allowed to create a new skill called lock pick, and start buying that, even at the same time as the security skill. \n\nThis is mainly for 2 reasons. \n\n1) I tend to give too much XP and this is a simple way to make players happy to dump XP into many things.\n\n2) The systems allows the player to buy specializations of said skills. The more specific, the more cheap or more powerful, so an specialization for lock picking, would be more powerful (as it only pertains to that) than a specialization for Security (that affects more rolls ) \n\nWhen we sat the first day, we talked about this modifications and had the conversation about \"please don't totally minmax this and break my world\". They agreed, but I had my reservations.\n\nThe campaign was a low fantasy, high science, futuristic tale of space exploration. Magic replaced by technology, with players regularly traveling between civilized planets, newly colonized planets, and unknown solar systems \n\nMy players had chosen characters with heavy military inclination, and they where part of a team of specialty operatives, highly trained soldiers with sense of pride, honor, and childlike lust for fighting powerful enemies.\n\nBut they also delved in other things, to give the feeling of real people with real dreams and hobbys.\nFor example, one had a profound love for the \"wonders of exploration\". \n\nAt some point, one asked if he could buy a new skill, for cooking. His character was interested in being able to cook for banquets and galas. the other liked the idea so much, that he also took on leveling up cooking, but focused on quick child centered meals\n\nI loved the idea, as it was a good way to develop characters, that was not directly \"murderhobo related\", so i let them, and allowed them the opportunities to used the skill. (On one particularly long space trip, they booked flight by taking the job of the ship's cooks)\n\nThe event that prompted me to write this, starts 3/4 into the main overarching plot, with the players racing to find the MacGuffin lost in human history.\n\nThey traced back the path that the human race took, from Earth, trough the stars, into the main hub for my history (13 main planets in the alliance + 2 dozen independent planets + hundreds of colonies or science stations)\n\nThey where on a recon mission, undercover, infiltrating a branch of humanity living in a planet where the sun's electromagnetic field made technology impossible, but that constant exposure to a harsh environment, made them physically resilient.\n\nThis event was planned from the start. I like to write down as much as possible about my worlds, including complex historical backgrounds for my planets, cultures, NPCs, etc .\n\nThey where meant to arrive in a small town, where a martial arts tournament was being held. In my planning, created a proud warrior archetipe NPC, that trough the powers of the Master, was going to face them in the finals or semifinals.\n\nI meant for them to befriend this guy, as it was relevant for the plot down the road. He was the guy working for \"The Guys\" that kept the secret (paper) records that the players needed. And this first approach was intended to make this proud warrior to apear, albeit rough, likable and relatable.\n\nThe description of the town was \"small town with little infrastructure. The tournament was held here to increase income from tourism and help develop local business\" \n\nWhat did my players do? They searched and found the town tavern, and went full master chef on me. \n\nSince their team was a mixture of SWAT, james bond types, and Navy Seals (think the A-Team), they had in between them, the economic's knowledge and expertise, the charisma and, you guess it, the cooking experience.\n\nThe players manned the kitchen, while the charismatic actor/spy member went full showman, and the rest served the tables.\n\nThey planned games, quiz, etc. so people would not notice the establishment incapability to serve all customers at once, while engaging people to stay for longer, drinking and eating more. The games helped space the orders, and made the queue manageable. \n\nCompletely ignoring the week long martial arts tournament, spending that time dealing with providers to make sure the tavern was stocked (while securing deals for lower costs).\nPre making foods, planing the shows and drinking games for that particular night...\n\nForced me to move the finals to Saturday noon, so the players could attend (tavern had low attendance), and even then they did not care.\n\nHad to make the organizers of the tournament, with the final contenders, have a \"victory\" dinner by booking the tavern, and just THEN, the players were interested in cooking for the NPC I created for them to like trough fists.\n\nAnd THEN, had to work really HARD for them to sit down and have a friendly beer with the guy.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. Players really role playing, developing interesting and believable characters, solving situations in an unconventional way.\n\nThat session, and campaign, going into the group history as \"that time the players ignored battle in favor of Tavern tycoon\"\n\nEdit: small typos",

The elemental goes fire mode and hops up on the roof, seeing some oni, just as he does that, Kalden runs between the cars and gets ready to climb the ladder to the roof as well. BAMB something stings kalden and the paladin, Paladin passes his fort save, Kalden fails, gasp poison! HE! one of the evil immortals- who is actually female (cue an entire combat of where's he? no I meant her, him whatever who's on 1st?)  and LAN! the other evil immortal! He is between the train cars with Kalden and another oni, Lan is in with the paladin and skelonies and a bunch of other small onis, a few are on the roof.\n\nso the Skelonies focus mainly on wiping out the little oni's giving the Paladin an opening to fight Lan, who blasts everyone with some kind of dust effect. the Paladin starts attacking Lan doing minimal damage but slowly zeroing in on his AC (its below 29 above24, above 26...so on)\n\nHe whips kalden with a steel whip causing another poison to take root, and lastly a poison clawed oni gets him (flat footed hanging off a ladder....) he now has 3 poisons in his system things begin looking dire... salad winds up for a spell.... and casts magic missile, because otherwise I mostly have big AOE's that would kill Kalden, my Skeletons and Skelonies do some damage, nothing can touch the paladins absurd ac.\n\nthe valk makes a wall of ice between He and Kalden, with us on the side with Kalden! Salad uses this opportunity to bravely hide inside a closet type thing and cast project shadow! I am a shadow now! yayy! He jumps over to the front of the train, pulls a bead off her necklace and throws it at the people she can see (valk and 2 minions) reflex saves all around, especially skeleton 2 (rolled a 20) who is super dodgey (damn rights he's dodgey- sketchy too says the paladin) but people still take some damage,  Lan is getting kinda desperate, the skelonies have just polished off the onis and are advancing on him, its right about now the fire elemental throws a fireball right in the middle of the mess, doing big damage to a lot of people, except the paladin, and one skeloni, Finally the Paladin Smites Lan so hard its absurd (3 crits in 5 attacks) and knocks him down dead, where his body begins to smoke.....\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhile they were faffing about in the passenger car I was zooming around in the engine compartment as a shadow, He had dropped at the front of the compartment and threw that fireball, thing, then I, under the effects of haste and battlecry manage to land 2 attacks dealing meh damage but draining 7 strength from her, the valkyrie heals Kalden somewhat and drags him in the compartment.\nHe jumps off the engine compartment, suffering an AOO and another point of str damage from me and runs to the area between the compartments, seeing Lan fall she pulls her whole necklace off and KABOOM! the train cars are rocked and seperated, some minions crushed, kalden covered in crispy He bits....\nWe regroup all load onto the front train and advance! (its at this point I decide Kalden needs to learn how to fly and lend him my reindeer cloak of minor flight, that I kinda forgot I had)  \n\nso we enter in this big room, we see various ritual points but specifically a congregation in the center,with one guy strung up on some kind of rack thing. we be-line there and the Paladin Dimension door-s the Valkyrie and the elemental right in there and begin hacking people apart. the priests succeed in partially completing the ritual then we kill them quickly, as we begin to celebrate a dragon of immense size (think colossal+) breaks from the ground and eats the guy on the rack and slowly coils itself around the room, its scaled a shimmering Sea-foam colour, this is the dragon of the East. it casually eats one of my skelonis and regards us cooly\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Paladin tries to talk to it in Chinese but that doesnt work, Salad and the Valkyrie address it formally in draconic, it communicates back not so much with words but with thoughts and feelings, it is a dragon of falling leaves of a small cool of the air, of salty sea-breezes we feel sadness as we explain current event, we feel anger at the rituals and the binding of the black dragon and we feel uncertainty of what it will do.... it cracks its way out of the room through the roof and disapears, we decide to try and stop the other 2 rituals. when we reach the train station we find they have collapsed the remaining tunnels- thats no issue for EARTH ELEMENTALS! that dig us through, the first ritual we were too late to stop, just seeing the white tail of the dragon of the west leaving the top of the cavern finally we breach the chamber and stop the ritual to awake the red dragon entirely, we now debate what to do next.... \n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSalad has figured out how to finish the ritual, either just to awake it, or also to bind it to us... but he focuses on wanting to awake it to try and break the hold on the other two...\nKalden zooms out to see whats going on, The two mind controlled dragons are fighting the Lion turtle in the bay (the bay is significantly larger than we remember it being....) and is actively eating the severed leg of the black dragon, the blue-green dragon is looking desperate and trying to communicate with his mind controlled brothers, Yama and the void yai are bloody but Yama is in the better condition in this fight, everywhere there is death and destruction...\n\n a heated discussion ensues, ultimately it was the elemental's genius that took what Salad knew- the food worked as a \"mind worm\" and took control of the dragons body- if bad food could do that could we fix it with cleansing food? cue the highest stakes Iron chef ever- the whole party helps, Valk summons a celestial eel to provide the basis for it, Salad provides great magical power (a level 5 spell slot) Kalden provides a powerful (level 4) healing spell, The Paladin provides lay on hands as a blessing/mercy and the elemental cooks it using his own fire...... we make 2 plates worth for the 2 controlled dragons. we discuss many options and decide that waking the last dragon to see if it will assist us is a good idea (and Salad REALLY wanted to wake that dragon)preparing the ritual, Salad changes into his formal robes (black satin with red embroidery and some strange old military type wizard cabal symbols, you dont wake a dragon without looking good. Salad begins the ritual, it works and the Red dragon shakes itself free of the ground, coiling around the room until it is looking at us, having it full encircled... as we address it,we feel the coldness of winter, the feeling of soft snow, the wind whipping by, we explain what happened and it understands and it gives us a feeling of it will help... but in its own way. \n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nit breaks free and speeds to the palace where it begins tearing it apart, the elemental takes one plate of food and brings it over to where the white and blue-green dragons are now fighting, I follow and explain the plan, the blue green dragon attacks the white ferociously pinning it to the ground (as the mind worm controlling the white is less used to its body) the elemental shoves the food down the white's throat, we feel the feelings of spring freshness of clean are, of renewal and a feeling of thanks as the cleansing food works... then we approach the black, the elemental has to sit out because he's still reforming from pushing the food into the white dragon and nearly getting eaten so we use a Skeloni to take the food over and similarly repeat the process, with the white holding off the lion turtle while the blue green pins it, unfortunately I loose a skeloni with the food but it works! Im down to my last skeloni  \n\nThe dragons working together flip the dragon turtle and drag him out to sea where they release him in a food rich area. where he can relax and feed. we see Yama roar and best the void yai, and we approach the palace seeing the red dragon staring at 3 figures.... we descend to meet them, its Lee, Lou and the emperor (who despite having his palace destroyed looks very regal)  Lee is insisting on smashing the emperor's head in, Lou wants him to stand trial and to learn all they can about running the country from him (apparently he was a decent emperor till the whole becoming a dragon god thing)\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n anyways we want to talk to the emperor, we begin to ask about the cult draining magic from the world via machines, so only they have magic. He doesnt want to tell us, welll its the Salad and Kalden show! as I use interrogate and he uses detect lies we begin to ask questions (interrogate gets me 5 at my level) so he answers them- the people an old woman and a impossibly large man, the old woman was wizened, she spoke fluent but slightly western influenced chinese, the man spoke in \"the grinding of metal\" they appeared via portals and gave him the machines and wanted an army in return, he accepted as he was chasing power (its at this point Im going SHIIIIIIIEEEETTT we are gonna have to deal with Baba Yaga.....) I ask him what they wanted with the army, he (and the dm) think ohhhh interrogation is over he can be all glib again... so he says \"i am done with questions\" I use Howling agony and he sinks to his knees (Impressively no screaming though) Salad says we are done when I say we are done... He manages to choke out that he didnt know what or where, just that they'd be in touch, The immortals take him and we now have as much down time as we want... in a ruined city... filled with bodies... UNSUPERVISED DOWNTIME! Salad immediately springs into action over the next two weeks he is doing EVERYTHING he can to improve the image of undead, undead rescue crews moving rubble, rebuilding homes, a sarah mclachlan song plays in the background as a slow sad shot of an orphan cradled gentle in the arms of a skeleton holding a bottle for it, Skeletons running soup kitchens, and policing areas from looters and quietly building a special project! \n\nso thats the end of China! which was a big part of the campaign, I hope everyone has enjoyed reading about it as much as I enjoyed doing it",
