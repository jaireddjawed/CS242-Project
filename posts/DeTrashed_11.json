We still managed to get 4 trash bags full in roughly 3 hours.\n\nEnded up leaving a majority of the microplastic due to the tedious nature of cleaning it up.  I was thinking of getting a sifter of some sorts so when I got home I took to the internet.  The best one that I found was the [RASCO rake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi9eSFbxgOs) but its doesnt link to a website to buy the rake.  The company mostly deals with larger cleanup machining like tractors and large-scale sifters. \n\nSo then I took off to Amazon and found [Shake'n Rake](http://www.shakenrake.com/Rake%20full%20of%20rocks%20OZ.jpg) that helps expedite the process shown [here](https://youtu.be/SSztlaswqws). The price tag on this one is $100 and that seems a bit steep so I'm coming to you /r/DeTrashed to see if you've had better luck with picking up micro plastics. ",

        "text": "Hello my friends if you are reading this you are probably pretty new to detrashing and may have some questions. so i figured I would answer some of the FAQ (frequently asked questions\n\nQ1)where to do it?\nA1)Anywhere! haha but actually you can do this about anywhere. you don't need to go out of your way and pick up hundreds of pounds of trash. the difference starts by just picking up the trash you walk past throughout your day! see a wrapper on you way to work, well thats a great way to start. if you want to be more involved maybe go for a walk around your street or a bike ride around your area and just stop wherever you see trash. if yu still want to get more into it, well there are community clean ups and coastal clean ups all over the place. I would recommend posting on your area(country, state or maybe even town) subreddit or facebook and ask for areas that could use some detrashing love.\n\nQ2) what to carry the trash in?\nA2) there are multiple answers to this, it really depends on preference. I personally like to use an old backpack. it can hold a good amount and it is reusable. other users like to brig garbage or shopping bags to fill up so they can just throw those away, this is of course a viable option as well(although not reusable). the last common  method that many of us use is a old 5 gallon bucket. these can be purchased at a walmart or another superstore or online. you can line these with bags if you want to keep it clean, but these are nice because they have a nice handle, are reusable, are durable ad can have many other uses. \n\nQ3) what to pick up with?\nA3) once again like everything else tis depends on p[reference and what you pick up. I personally pick up mostly recyclables such as metal cans and plastic bottles. due to this I don't use any kind of protection as it is not necessary. others like to use gloves to keep some of the gross shit off their hands. if you are picking up some tough stuff like old rusty metal, then work glove might be appropriate for you. one last suggestion would be to use a grabber. now this pairs well with the 5 gallon bucket from the previous answer. this will give you some space between you and the trash which may be nice for you, additionally using a grabber instead of a poker is idea as you can pick up fragile things (like glass) without having to worry.\n\nQ4) what do I do about dangerous materials (needles, pee bottles human waste etc)\nA4) FUCKING LEAVE THAT SHIT ALONE! seriously don't touch anything that can cause harm to you. tips, don't pick up large piles pf trash these can hide things like needles, instead do piece by piece. Also if you don't feel safe in an area you are detrashing for any reason(getting dark out, sketchy dude watching yo etc) just leave there is plenty of other spots for you to clean up never put yourself into a risky position. \n\nQ5) common hazards\n\nA5) Poisson ivy loves edge habitat which is where you will find most of the trash you will pick up, keep and eye out for this 3 leafed bastard. a shower after detrashing can help remove this (coldwater and soap) \n\n  needles- these can be hidden, if you see one just avoid it the best you can, if you see a lot of them call your local police and let them know about this hazard. there is a good chance they have a contact or info about people who do take care of this stuff.\n\n  Cars(if your on the side of the road) try to wear bright reflective colors. it can be hard to see someone on the side of the road sometimes so always try to make yourself as visible as possible. \n\n  Insects- the most common insect I find are ants in soda cans and such but there are others you need to watch out for. WASPS- if you see one in a can or somewhere near, just move along. they normally don't want to bother you and will leave you alone the majority of the time. a lot of the time they just want top get the residue sugar from a can or food. if you leave the trash you can grab it another day.  TICKS- always do a tick check after detrashing, you would be surprised at the areas they can hide both on you and in the environment!. \n\nIf anyone has any other suggestions for  post them below and I will add them in, its just i am at work and don't have a huge amount of time to make this as elaborate as i would like. later  i will add some picture to help as well.\n\n",

        "text": "I live by the beach and I constantly see bags of dog poop left behind. This is dumbest thing I've ever seen. First off and most importantly, dog poop is biodegradable. Putting it into a plastic bag just traps it in a non biodegradable vessel...its really really stupid when you think about it. There are thousands of plastic bags full of dog shit lying in our landfills when that shit would have disappeared in the first place. We have made a huge problem when there wasn't one in the first place. Everyone is so afraid of some poop. Secondly, and this is specific to the beach, we have tides. The ocean will just come and take it away. \n\nWhatever the case, putting biodegradable waste in plastic bags is one of the most backwards, dumb things in my opinion. Try to find biodegradable, compostable bags to put it in. Most people just use regular plastic bags...and leave them on the beach. The logic of this situation is frustratingly idiotic. \n\nEdit: lots of info here that I wasn't aware of. I think the biggest take away is concentration, ie amount. My area you see it, but there isn't a lot, so I feel that the amount that is around does not justify all of the plastic being used which in turn just prevents it from biodegrading quickly in the elements.  Some of the comments make it sound like there are mountains of dog poop on the beach turning the ocean into a toxic dump. That just isn't the case. What I do see is lots of pieces of plastic and trash on the beach. Much more so than dog poop. I also felt that this sub is dedicated more to preventing the build up of trash through ideas and awareness. But it's always good to hear the other side of the story.",

We invested in a couple of Nalgene water bottles and a brita filter and haven’t bought a single plastic water bottle since. We don’t mind room temperature water and it’s the perfect solution for us.\n\nI ALWAYS used a straw when we went out to eat. I hated the idea of putting my mouth on a cup thousands of other people gave and it probably wasn’t cleaned thoroughly. Metal reusable straws. A pack of them on amazon for around $10 and they are a game changer. It may seem weird to bring your own straw to a restaurant but I can just keep mine in my bag and just not use the straw the waiter/waitress leaves! \n\nPlastic grocery bags! Everyone uses them. I bought some of the reusable bags Aldi has and I started leaving them in my trunk so now, every time I go grocery shopping I bring them in with me and I just let the cashier put my items in the shopping cart and I will transfer them into the bags before putting them into my trunk. I also crochet and have found several great pattern for reusable market bags and I am in the process of making some at the moment! \n\nI found this sub and it encouraged me to share my changes and want to do even better! I am going to start volunteering at my local city for trash clean up this week! \nThank you all for your environmental clean up and care for your planet! We got this💪🏻",

This is a pre requisite for the democratization of science and without it, research into plastic pollution will be slow and largely unresponsive. ",

Rather than use this data as a justification to do nothing while living in these places, I want to highlight the possibility of giving directly to campaigns that help developing countries establish effective waste management and recycling infrastructure.\n\nThanks to everyone who participated in this past week's fundraising and trash collection.
