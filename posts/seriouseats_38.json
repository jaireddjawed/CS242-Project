Anyways, how is that any better than Trump? You think you should post political stuff, I disagree, you block. Sounds like you want to keep your \"alternate facts\" just like he does. I used to be a big fan of serious eats, but this left a real sour taste in my mouth. Thought other people should know whats going on. I'm sure this will be deleted by Kenji as soon as he sees it.

        "text": "Alright, so just got the book a few days ago, and finally got up to the first recipes last night.  Been needing some hard boiled eggs in the house anyway.  \n\nFollowed directions as closely as I could, and they turned out a bit overcooked still, and trying to figure out why.  Given all of that extra effort, it didn't seem worth it to me over the simple \"set it and forget it\" method I had been doing before, which of course always overcooked them too.  \n\nI used an All-Clad 3 qt saucepan, and the step of cooling from boiling down to a sub-simmer at about 190° took over 5 minutes off the heat completely.  With a very low flame on, I was able to keep it stable at about 193° or so, but when exactly does that 11 minute timer start?  When it reaches that re-boil?  When it crosses below 195°?  Or when I turn the burner back on?  \n\nI'll experiment again soon, but just curious what you folks have tried...",

I did substitute country ham for the bacon because I'm trying to use up a whole ham I got as a gift.  Flavor was excellent and I'm a big fan of 1-pot dishes.\n\nHowever, the chicken wasn't quite as fall-apart tender as I would expect from a braised dish.  Definitely needed a knife to get some meat off the bone.  \n\nFollowed the directions on temps and time pretty closely.  Went into the oven @ 350 deg. for 45 minutes after simmering on the stove top for 2-3 minutes.\n\nI think it could have used a bit more time in the oven as the stock was not hugely reduced but I was hungry!  The chicken, though, was definitely cooked through.  Maybe next time lower the temp a bit and braise for a longer period of time?",
