        "text": "This is a repost of mine. Figured that it was still topical though, since the same badhistory still gets floated around every year.\n\nSince Thanksgiving is tomorrow, I thought I'd discuss all the bad history that gets thrown about when talking about the history of the Thanksgiving holiday as practiced in the United States.\n\n[This](http://www.manataka.org/page269.html) site has a pretty typical explanation of the supposed *real* history of Thanksgiving, linking it to the [Pequot War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot_War#The_Mystic_massacre) and the Mystic massacre.\n\nDuring the Pequot War of 1637 and 1638 there were numerous atrocities committed against the the native peoples. Perhaps the most egregious of these was the Mystic massacre on May 26, 1637, when colonists attacked the village of Misistuck. Most of the warriors of the village were involved in raiding English settlements, so the place was inhabited by mostly women and children. As many as six or seven hundred non-combatants were killed in this attack. \n\nAt the conclusion of the war William Bradford (the governor of Plymouth colony) called for a day of thanksgiving in recognition of the victory.\n\nThis is often cited as the first Thanksgiving and the source of the modern holiday.\n\nHowever, there are several problems with this. The first major issue is the time of the holiday. If we held Thanksgiving holiday in the spring, rather than the fall of each year, then perhaps this could be the original source of the holiday. However, Thanksgiving *isn't* celebrated in the spring, but in November. \n\nNor was this \"day of thanksgiving\" formalized as a holiday. It was a one time event to celebrate a military victory, and such one time \"days of thanksgiving\" were fairly common. \n\nBut beyond all that, this wasn't even the first \"day of thanksgiving\" held in the colonies.\n\nIn Plymouth there *was* a fall feast held in 1621, and we have records of it from participants. \n\nIn 1623 Plymouth held *another* fall feast after a particularly good harvest had come despite an earlier drought. \n\nAccording to the proprietor's directions for the Berkeley Hundred colony, the day the ship landed was to be [\". . . yearly and perpetually kept as a day of thanksgiving\"](http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/jamestown-and-plymouth-compare-and-contrast.htm). The ship arrived on December 4, 1619, which is still closer to the date at which the modern Thanksgiving than is a May celebration. \n\nThere were even more days of thanksgiving held. According to David Hackett Fischer in *Albion's Seed*, there were 22 days of thanksgiving held in the first half century of the Bay colony's existence. To quote him further:\n\n&gt;“If daily and weekly movements were unusually strong in New England, other common rhythms were exceptionally weak or even absent altogether. The Puritans made a point of abolishing the calendar of Christian feasts and saints' days. The celebration of Christmas was forbidden in Massachusetts on pain of a five-shilling fine. In England, the Puritan Parliament prohibited the observance of Christmas, Easter, Whitsunday, saints' days and holy days.” \n\n&gt;“A fourth Puritan festival was Thanksgiving, which by 1676 had became an annual event, held on a Thursday in November or December. In earlier years, days of Thanksgiving were appointed ad hoc for special occasions by civil authorities. The first Thanksgiving in the Bay Colony happened on 22 February 1630/31, after provision ships arrived just in time to prevent starvation. \n\n&gt;Approximately twenty-two special days of Thanksgiving were held in the first half-century of the Bay Colony. After New England survived King Philip's War, Thanksgivings began to occur regularly in November. The appointed day was Thursday, which had been lecture day in the churches of Boston and Ipswich. Special days of Thanksgiving continued, but by the late 1670s this event had become an autumn ritual, in which a fast was followed by a family dinner and another fast. The main event was a sermon which reminded New Englanders of their founding purposes.” \n\nThen in 1863 Abraham Lincoln called for another day of Thanksgiving in a document written by Seward, part of which states:\n\n&gt;It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the **last Thursday of November next**, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union.\n\n*This* is the origin of the modern day of Thanksgiving, and the traditions of fall celebration and feasting go back well before the Pequot War.

        "text": "A few weeks back, FAIR ran [a piece opposed to intervention in Syria.](http://fair.org/home/media-roll-out-welcome-mat-for-humanitarian-war-in-syria/) Now, most of it I'm going to ignore because it's not stuff I know enough to comment on, and R2 would block most of it anyway. But buried in there are a few bits about Bosnia, and I couldn't resist.\n\nChances are that when your chief source is this:\n\n&gt; In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review (10/07), “The Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in Inhumanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse),” Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the West’s business in Bosnia had nothing to do with saving lives—and much to do with the contrary.\n\nyour perception of Bosnia isn't going to be great. I've tackled [Herman](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3chqxh/ed_hermans_srebrenica_denial_a_refutation/) and Peterson's [nonsense](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/498bjm/rwanda_deniers_circlejerk_each_other/) at length before, including [this very piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3zt23h/more_yugoslavia_badhistory_ed_herman_and_david/), though admittedly that time I just addressed the most glaring falsehoods rather than the generally misleading narrative of the article.\n\nBut let's see what FAIR opt to quote:\n\n&gt; The Bill Clinton administration, they note, actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date, while “helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.” \n\nDoing this article has revealed a long string of people giving unhelpful citations. First, FAIR simply cite Herman and Peterson's (H-P hereafter) entire multi-part article, with no additional direction besides one quote. H-P themselves often give annoyingly general and vague references. For example, one place from the article where FAIR seem to have gotten the idea of Clinton's \"sabotage\" is this passage:\n\n&gt;  To serve these ends the Clinton administration sabotaged a series of peace efforts between 1993 and the Dayton accords of 1995;17\n\nThe citation simply gives its only source *Balkan Odyssey*, David Owen's memoirs from the war. No pages or even chapters are specified, let alone any consideration of whether Owen is an entirely reliable source on the topic (Answer: he isn't - the vast majority of historians of the Bosnian War regard Owen as unwarrantedly sympathetic to the Serb nationalists, and too keen to blame the Americans for his own failures). But even more interesting are H-P's similar words from the very same sentence FAIR quote, immediately before:\n\n&gt; Falk appears unaware of the diplomatic responses of the Clinton administration in sabotaging the Lisbon accord and its successors, and its military responses in *helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.*\n\n[FAIR's quoted section italicised]\n\nSo the Clinton administration is supposedly responsible for prolonging the war in Bosnia because it sabotaged the Lisbon Accord. Just one problem with this - the signing and then renunciation of the Lisbon accords took place in March 1992, 10 months before Clinton took office. The US government at the time was the Bush Sr. administration. \n\nFAIR also don't bother to correct H-P's reference to the \"Bosnian Muslims\", when they should be saying \"Bosnian government\". FAIR are evidently aware of this, as they refer to Muhamed Sacirbey as \"Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first ambassador to the UN\", not \"the Bosnian Muslims' first ambassador to the UN\".\n\nThe charge that Clinton armed and brought *Mujahedin* into Bosnia is very stretched. In H-P's relevant section on it in the third part of their article, they claim the following:\n\n&gt; But the Clinton administration overlooked the regressive ideology of its “assets,” and supported and participated in the importation of vast quantities of arms and up to 4,000 Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia\n\nThis they cite to Cees Wiebes, *Intelligence and the War in Bosnia*. Annoyingly, they're citing his book, which I don't own a copy of, rather than his virtually identical [Appendix to the Dutch Srebrenica Report](http://niod.nl/sites/niod.nl/files/C.%20Wiebes%20-%20Intelligence%20en%20de%20oorlog%20in%20Bosni%C3%AB%201992-1995.%20De%20rol%20van%20de%20inlichtingen-%20en%20veiligheidsdiensten%20-%20Engels.pdf), which is available online, which makes checking page numbers a pain, but having identified the relevant section (pp. 182-183) of the Appendix, a couple of things become apparent about their misleading use of it:\n\n* The 4,000 figure is not Wiebes' figure, but merely the highest estimate he reports. It is clear from the other estimates that this estimate is an outlier of low credibility - the next highest estimate given is just 1,500, and several are below 1,000. Wiebes notes that even the Serb nationalists only claimed there were about 1,300. H-P have said \"up to 4,000\" for no other reason than it was the highest number they could cite.\n* Nothing in Wiebes' section on the mujahideen remotely suggests that the US were arming them or helping them enter the country. Indeed, he suggests that their presence was a source of (albeit minor) tension between Washington and the Bosnian government.\n\nGetting back to FAIR's piece now:\n\n&gt; America’s support in this case for jihadists—a secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali (Guardian, 9/9/06)—further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem.\n\n\"Discussed\" here meaning \"briefly mentioned in a book review\".\n\n&gt; In predictable fashion, US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention (Extra!, 10-11/92), dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors, parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment.\n\nIf so, it \"led the charge\" so ineffectively that the US didn't actually intervene for years after the war started, and didn't do much [until a few months before the end.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Deliberate_Force) Indeed the most influential media story about the war - the ITN visits to the concentration camps at Omarska and Trnopolje in August 1992 - were actually just revealing to the population things the Bush administration had known about for a couple of months and not revealed. Far from preparing popular will for a government keen to intervene, ITN's revelation undermined Bush's desire to brush the issue under the carpet and try to avoid getting involved. Later in the war, the heavy media focus on the Ahmici massacre by Croat nationalists against Bosniaks actually heavily weakened the case for intervention\n(for more on this, see James Gow, Richard Paterson and Alison Preston, *Bosnia by Television*, pp. 88-89).\n\nAnd then it moves onto Kosovo, which I can't go into because R2.",

Implying that the musketeer is somehow a 17th century \"evolution\" of the knight.\n\nFirst off, by the end of the 16th century, musketeers and calivermen on foot wearing any armor aside from perhaps a helmet had become extremely rare ([early 17th century musketeer](http://www.re-enactmentsupplies.co.uk/image/cache/data/Musket-500x500.png)). A matchlock musket alone could weigh up to 20 lbs or more, not counting all the ammo and other equipment. So pretty much no one wanted to haul around a breastplate in addition to all that, and military theorists at the time did not recommend it. Second, even for footsoldiers during this period the armored pikeman still tended to be seen as the more honorable/gentlemanly position. It would have been pretty unlikely to put it mildly for a member of the nobility to actually choose to be a musketeer.\n\nIt might be that the image is trying to depict a mounted harquebusier, who did often wear just a helmet and simple breastplate/backplate. However the harquebus and carbine were relatively short, lightweight weapons which did not require a forked rest like the one depicted in the picture, and a mounted harquebusier would be carrying one or two firelock pistols with him, which aren't depicted at all. Also it still doesn't really fit socially or tactically. It would be a bit like saying that the [M26 Pershing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M26_Pershing) evolved into the [HMMWV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee).\n\nIf you wanted to pick an \"evolution\" of the knight in the early 17th century, why not pick an [actual lancer, or even a cuirassier](https://imgur.com/a/sqED0) (essentially an armored lancer without the lance)? As Bert Hall pointed out if anything it was probably the armored reiter/cuirassier that brought an end to the traditional knight, not musketeers and pikemen. Essentially upper class cavalry just started trading in their lances for neat, expensive wheelock pistols.\n\n*Pike and Shot Tactics 1590-1660*, Keith Roberts\n\n*Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe*, Bert S.

Not unlike the fossil fuel industry or even the recording industry.\n\nI'm not really interested in saying who was more racists in their hearts - Northerners or Southerners - because my racism-o-meter is being repaired and the discussion inevitably downplays history in the service of finger pointing. \n\nNow, to the claim that \"slavery wasn't about racism\", the slave owners would be surprised to hear that. \n\nHere is noted slave owner [Thomas Jefferson](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch15s28.html) proclaim black people to be inferior:\n\n&gt;The blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. It is not against experience to suppose, that different species of the same genus, or varieties of the same species, may possess different qualifications.\n\nOr let's move to [John C. Calhoun](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun), one of the most powerful American politicians to ever hold office. He's famously threatened secession for the slightest perceived injustice.  One time, when his morning toast was a little too burnt, Calhoun demanded an apology from all Northern governors. Also, he was unabashed white supremacist:\n\n&gt;I hold that in the present state of civilization, where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other pnysical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good — a positive good.\n\nThen there is [Thomas R.R. Cobb](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ASZrEQZ0Pp8C&amp;pg=PR204&amp;lpg=PR204&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CIt+may+be+truly+said+that+the+southern+climate+is+more+favorable+to+the+health+and+longevity+of+the+negro.+But+making+due+allowances+in+both+cases+for+these+causes,+it+is+still+true,+that+the+negroes+are+less+addicted+to+crime,+and+are+more+healthy+and+long-lived,+in+a+state+of+slavery+than+of+freedom.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_kJGfSyJSf&amp;sig=3Mq7GzeD6k9xOXqz2jm-J7qsmUI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLvcm45anQAhVGurwKHbRdAbkQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CIt%20may%20be%20truly%20said%20that%20the%20southern%20climate%20is%20more%20favorable%20to%20the%20health%20and%20longevity%20of%20the%20negro.%20But%20making%20due%20allowances%20in%20both%20cases%20for%20these%20causes%2C%20it%20is%20still%20true%2C%20that%20the%20negroes%20are%20less%20addicted%20to%20crime%2C%20and%20are%20more%20healthy%20and%20long-lived%2C%20in%20a%20state%20of%20slavery%20than%20of%20freedom.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false), a key figure in the creation of the Southern Constitution:\n\n&gt;“It may be truly said that the southern climate is more favorable to the health and longevity of the negro. But making due allowances in both cases for these causes, it is still true, that the negroes are less addicted to crime, and are more healthy and long-lived, in a state of slavery than of freedom.”\n\n\nTl;dr - American slavery was a racially based caste system whose core principal was white supremacy. To say otherwise, shows a deep misunderstanding of history and disregard for easily verified truth. \n",

It has been a while since my last review, and I have at least several days off before I go back to Perth, so I figured it would be a good time to finish my review of Judgement Day at Marathon:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EYEeITctjg&amp;list=TL9IUtklmz66uJbkxHq-QK60_Mv3Xxc7bp\n\n19.29: Inaccurate depiction of Persian army. DRINK!\n\n19.40: Athenians with the Spartan lambada symbol on their shields. DRINK!\n\n19.59: Yet another depiction of Persian army. DRINK!\n\n20.06: Still more Athenians with the Spartan lambada symbol on their shields. DRINK!\n\n20.16: The narrator states it was the Persians who attacked first by launching volleys of arrow, but Herodotus makes it clear it was the Greeks who took the offensive by charging the Persian lines. DRINK!\n\n20.27: \"Under a tidal wave of missiles, there is nowhere for the Athenians to hide\". Except under their shields in a close-order formation which was effective at resisting Persian archery. \n\n22.46: Gah! Not only does it show the Persians not utilizing the tactics of which we have ample evidence (the first rank consists of spearmen behind a wall of wicker spara shields, whilst the following ranks are made up of archers):\n\nhttp://www.ancientbattles.com/Persians/Spara.jpg\n\nThe documentary also asserts the Persians launched a wild light infantry charge after the failed archery attack. NO! GAH! NO! The Persians did not attack first. Herodotus makes this abundantly clear. And the Persians were disciplined warriors. They would have advanced at a steady order behind their shield wall. And last of all, the front rank of the Persian army would have been wearing metal scale armour, hardly making them \"light\". DRINK!\n\n23.03: \"Hey guys, we aren't going to use our weapons. We'll just run into your shields and push. That okay with you?\". \"All chill bro, we'll just push back.  We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt\".\n\n23.22: The academic calls the greek aspis an innovation in warfare. Because obviously large shields were completely unprecedented, and not used for by the Assyrians:\n\nhttp://l7.alamy.com/zooms/f3b179968f72425bbbc0ec3fc07b2290/assyrian-soldiers-in-battle-archers-protected-by-large-reed-mate-shields-bp28yy.jpg\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a5/c5/db/a5c5db30393d4098350ec40ef18c6b72.jpg\n\nOr thousands of years earlier, by the Sumerians:\n\nhttp://www.historyonthenet.com/sites/default/files/styles/adaptive/public/field/image/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01.jpg?itok=F1YqqohF\n\nDRINK!\n\n24.03: This is less a battle and more a group of English theatre-goers waiting patiently in line.\n\n24.1: Hollywood fight scene with dual wielding! Two drinks! DRINK! DRINK!\n\n24.22: Dory does not have a butt spike. DRINK! Also, butt spike. Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n24.66: Okay, I will admit this scene is at least choreographed well.\n\n24.44: An armour made of bonded strips of leather and linen is not lamellar, which is a completely different design. DRINK!\n\n25.23: GAH! Again perpetuating the myth of a Persian \"light\" army. DRINK!\n\n25.25: The narrator says the Persians had sickle-swords. Sickle-swords. SICKLE-SWORDS! The sickle-sword had not been used for over 1000 years or so  by this point. The Persians would have used either a spear, ot a curved sword quite common to the Middle-East called the makhaira:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Greek-Persian-2.jpg\n\nOr an axe called the sagaris:\n\nhttp://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/schools/primaryhistory/images/ancient_greeks/sparta/g_persian_archer.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n23.51: Inaccurate Persian army! DRINK!\n\n25.51: Again, the documentary asserts it was the Persians taking the offensive against the Greeks, when it was the other way round. DRINK!\n\n27.33: Okay, is it me or did it look like those two soldiers decide to just start making out on the field of battle?\n\n30.00: The academic states the Greeks then faced the Immortals. The problem is Herodotus never mentioned the Immortals were at Marathon, so this is mere speculation at this point. DRINK!\n\n30.09: The narrator calls the Immortals faceless. Except for all the artwork showing their faces. DRINK!\n\n31.53: Seriously the description of the battle is completely messed up compared to how Herodotus relates it. Herodotus makes no mention of valleys, nor late redeployment of the phalanx formation. The Greeks instead organized the formation with a weakened centre straight away to match the Persian lines, and then marched forward. There was no defensive action in a valley! DRINK!\n\n32.15: Faceless Immortals in a completely open formation. DRINK!\n\n\n32.18: Also, the shields of the Immortals like like thin wicker. In actually their shields were most likely wood with a metal boss:\n\nhttp://media.gettyimages.com/photos/basrelief-depicting-mede-and-persian-guards-apadana-persepolis-iran-picture-id475595321?k=6&amp;m=475595321&amp;s=594x594&amp;w=0&amp;h=Z_Tq1rDIna7aqEUaSt92ad6pzSAsAlzmm3FDvWIbBv8=\n\nDRINK!\n\n32.27: Miltiades was such a great general he magically transformed the Greeks into Macedonian pikemen. DRINK!\n\n33.32: Historians should not have a New Jersey accent. They need to be British and have bow ties.\n\n33.33: Faceless Immortals with no shields charging out of formation. DRINK!\n\n33.47: And yet more pushing. DRINK!\n\n35.34: And again the loving legacy of 300 can only benefit us in historical documentaries. ಠ_ಠ\n\n35.55: TOO MUCH USE OF THE WORD LITERALLY!\n\nThere is ten minutes left to his documentary but since I want to go play Mount and Blade: Viking Conquest Reforged, and the rest of the documentary is really just repeating all the inaccuracies I have already addressed, I shall end my review now.  Spoiler: The Greeks win. Hope you enjoyed it!\n\nEdit: Love Viking Conquest Reforged but it kept on crashing.

I want to start by being clear: his broad point was absolutely correct, Spanish speakers have been in the area of the US for a very long time. St. Augustine, the oldest European-American city, is a good half century older than Jamestown. In Arizona in particular it isn't even a contest, as while it was always a pretty distant outpost of New Spain it had still been under the control of New Spain since the sixteenth century (albeit very marginally).\n\nBut what about the actual, literal accuracy of his claim: was there a European language spoken in the current territory of the United States? In which case, with apologies to Governor Kaine, I must say, *si*, but with the Portuguese pronunciation. The [1502 Cantino planisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantino_planisphere) was made in Portugal and depicts the southeastern coast of the US, thus beating Ponce de Leon by a decade. We don;t actually know anything about the expeditions, but at the very least we can say that the sailors must have gotten within twelve nautical miles of the United States coastline, thus within US territory. Also quite likely they landed, and and spoke Portugese to one another, to take on supplies. *Si* in the Italian pronunciation is also possible, as John Cabot ie Giovanno Caboto, a Genoese merchant hired by Henry VII in 1497, may have reached Maine and even lower.\n\nThere is also a possibility of a *já*, depending on how one views the Norse settlements in the Americas. The two settlements discovered, at L'anse aux Meadows and Point Rosee, are both in Newfoundland, technically not with in the US borders. But it doesn't necessarily follow that either of these represent Vinland, the southern most land Leif Eriksson reached (someone who knows more about the distribution of grapes can comment). But even if Vinland is in Newfoundland, it is entirely possible that exploration went lower, reaching the United States.\n\nThere is also a very tenuous *agian*, as there has been a persistent arguement (since the seventeenth century) that the first Europeans in the New World were actually Basque fisherman and whalers. It is an unusually plausible pre-Columbian suggestion, but it has no direct evidence one way or the other.\n\nSo there you have it, Spanish is either the second, third, fourth or fifth European language spoken within US territory.",

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Bombing_Survey#Atomic_bombing)\n\n&gt;specefically, \"Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.\"\n\nOur friend here uses [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Bombing_Survey#Atomic_bombing) which is about [this survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20080528051903/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/USSBS/USSBS.pdf).  The quote used does come directly from the survey (p. 107) but is stripped of important context.  The last sentence of the directly preceding paragraph states:\n\n&gt;Nevertheless, it seems clear that, even without atomic bombing attacks, air supremacy over Japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion.\n\nTaken together with the linked quote it is clear that the survey is not saying there was no reason for the atomic bombings but rather is saying conventional bombings could have accomplished the same goal (forcing unconditional surrender) eventually.  Considering that the larger of the two bombings caused damage equivalent to roughly 2100 tons of conventional bombs (p. 102) and the total bombings in July totaled 42700 tons and was ramping up to a planned 115000 tons per month (p. 86) it is safe to say that three to four more months of conventional bombing is unlikely to have cause less damage than the atomic bombs.\n\nEDIT: u/killswitch247 [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5becks/the_us_government_concluded_there_was_no_reason/d9ofggg/) that the 2100 tons representing the atomic bomb does not necessarily equate 2100 tons from a standard bombing raid.\n\nWith regards to the effect of the atomic bombs the survey has the following to say:\n\n&gt;As might be expected, the primary reaction of the populace to the bomb was fear, uncontrolled terror, strengthened by the sheer horror of the destruction and suffering witnessed and experienced by the survivors. Prior to the dropping of the atomic bombs, the people of the two cities had fewer misgivings about the war than people in other cities and their morale held up after it better than might have been expected. Twenty-nine percent of the survivors interrogated indicated that after the atomic bomb was dropped they were convinced that victory for Japan was impossible. Twenty-four percent stated that because of the bomb they felt personally unable to carry on with the war. Some 40 percent testified to various degrees of defeatism. A greater number (24 percent) expressed themselves as being impressed with the power and scientific skill which underlay the discovery and production of the atomic bomb than expressed anger at its use (20 percent). In many instances, the reaction was one of resignation. (p. 103)\n\n&gt;In the succeeding meetings of the Supreme War Direction Council, the differences of opinion previously existing as to the Potsdam terms persisted exactly as before. **By using the urgency brought about through fear of further atomic bombing attacks**, the Prime Minister found it possible to bring the Emperor directly in to the discussions of the Potsdam terms. Hirohito, acting as arbiter, resolved the conflict in favor of unconditional surrender. (p. 106)\n\nSo it is clear the authors of the paper believed that the atomic bombings had at least had some effect on the decision of the Japanese to agree to the offered terms.",

        "title": "In which Alexander would've won at Waterloo",
        "author": "TheGuineaPig21",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5bahu5/in_which_alexander_wouldve_won_at_waterloo/",
        "text": "So someone posted [this article](https://thoughtexperiments.net/alexander-at-waterloo/) the other day on /r/history. It gave me a good laugh before it got deleted. This is why: it's a “thought experiment” that proposes that if you took Alexander the Great and placed him on the battlefield of Waterloo on June 18th, 1815, he would have defeated the Duke of Wellington.\n\nNo, not with the Grande Armée. With his Macedonian phalanx.\n\nNow, this is at the surface a ridiculous suggestion. And that's because if you give it any further thought, it's still equally ridiculous. The author of the article is essentially paraphrasing the argument of historian Arther Ferrill; although he may be being misquoted here, given the length of the direct quotations taken from him it seems unlikely. Ferrill is, according to his wiki page, an expert on Ancient Rome and military history. I'm not so sure about the latter.\n\nFerrill argues that military strategy essentially went unchanged between Alexander and Napoleon, and because of Alexander's sheer genius he would easily compensate for any difference in technology in that span. He makes just one condition: to ignore the psychological effect of gunpowder weapons. This is a pretty large one, and it raises some questions. How do you separate the physical and psychological impacts? Could you make a separation in the case of, say, Alexander's heavy cavalry? But nevertheless I'll still take it in good faith.\n\nFerrill's first argument is this:\n\n&gt;Napoleon’s first mistake was in delaying the initial attack against Wellington for so long, a mistake compounded by the fact that Prussians were coming to relieve the British. Everything we know about Alexander suggests that he would not have been so sluggish and indecisive. At the Granicus and at Issus [the two first major battles the Macedonians fought against the Persians] Alexander moved from line of column into line of battle and attacked his enemy without delay. In his other battles he always moved vigorously, once he was in tactical range, to close with the enemy.  Furthermore Alexander would not have mounted an attack either with cavalry or with infantry unsupported by the other arm,\n\nThis is something that Ferrill does repeatedly: ignores the context of decisions by pretending the development of new weapons systems doesn't change strategy or tactics. Napoleon didn't delay the start of battle because of a lack of some Hellenistic killer instinct. The battlefield was wet, which affected deployment of cavalry and cannons, and greatly limited the effectiveness of solid shot. Nor did he know of the Prussian threat to his flank, otherwise he would've presumably changed his deployment plans. Besides, rushing into battle isn't necessarily a virtue: would Ferrill criticize Scipio at Ilipa?\n\n&gt;“Alexander would not have stayed behind his line the way Napoleon did. Wellington and Ney exposed themselves to risks all day long. Ney went through five horses on the afternoon of the battle, but Napoleon was so far behind his line that he could not intervene in tactical operations. He is reported to have been angry when Ney organized the French cavalry for the initial charge, but the Emperor was too far away to prevent it. Although Napoleon’s presence on the field, according to Wellington, ‘was worth 40,000 men’ (a statement that could be made equally well of Alexander), at Waterloo he dissipated this effect by remaining too far to the rear. That is a mistake that Alexander could not conceivably have made.”\n\nPresumably he would've wanted Napoleon to charge Wellesley himself and engage him in single combat. Napoleon's performance at Waterloo doesn't deserve to escape criticism, but there are realities of commanding a large nineteenth century army that Ferrill is simply ignoring. Not the least of which was one of the great strengths of Napoleon as a commander was the independence of action he trusted to his (mostly) excellent subordinates.\n\n&gt;“Since the British troops were able to protect themselves behind the ridge selected by Wellington, French guns did little damage. On the whole artillery was not an important factor in the battle of Waterloo.\n\nYes, this is his grand way to completely ignore the element of artillery. Because Wellington deliberately designed his entire formation and battle plan around Napoleon's supreme artillery firepower, that therefore means cannons are not an important factor. Presumably Ferrill thinks that Wellington would've deployed in an identical manner facing hoplites?\n\n&gt;Gunpowder would have been new to him [Alexander], but he had some experience in using catapults as field artillery, at somewhat less range and destructive power.\n\nUnderstatement of the fucking century right here.\n\n&gt;...it is doubtful that Alexander’s army would otherwise have been decisively affected by British firepower. Although Napoleon’s forces attacked in even deeper formation than the Macedonian phalanx, and were therefore a more inviting object of attack for British artillerymen, artillery did not prevent the French from getting within twenty yards of the British line in the fateful final assault. Presumably Alexander’s troops might have done that also.\n\nFerrill seems to be mixing up the first infantry attack with the last strike by the Imperial Guard. Regardless, Ferrill again ignores the point of the tactic of letting the French draw close before opening fire: it was meant to protect the soldiers from French artillery. There would be no obligation to do this against spearmen. Further than that, Wellington would essentially have free reign to deploy in any manner he saw fit given that a Greek army would have no way to pin or hold his units in place. Smaller, less-deep units of musketeers could easily maneuver and flank a phalanx to deliver devastating enfillade. Phalanxes were notoriously vulnerable to flanking movements in general; why Ferrill believes that Wellington and his subordinates wouldn't exploit this weakness is left completely unremarked upon.\n\n&gt;Likewise the infantry musket was not an especially formidable weapon. Useless at 100 yards, it had some effect at fifty, but the injunction to ‘wait until you see the whites of their eyes’ was widely applied in Napoleonic warfare, and the Guard had approached to within twenty yards before Wellington turned his own forces against it. At a distance of twenty yards the Macedonian phalanx with its thirteen-foot lances would have been a greater threat to Wellington than Napoleon’s Guards. It is of course possible that British firepower might have broken their ranks just as it did, in conjunction with a bayonet charge, against Napoleon’s Guard. But a bayonet charge against the Macedonians would have been futile. Since it took several seconds to reload a musket, and the British had only two lines of musketeers, Macedonians within a range of fifty yards or less, trained as they were to charge at the double when necessary, could have closed with devastating effect against the British infantry. Assuming that they could have withstood the initial barrage of fire in which, admittedly, they would have taken heavy losses\n\nThis is some eye-rolling stuff. I half-expected Ferrill to suggest equipping the army with longbows instead. No, muskets were not “useless” at 100 yards; while hitting individual targets at that range could be difficult, firing into a massed phalanx muskets would have devastating impact. Not to mention what effect grapeshot would have. The notion that the sarissa would be a better weapon on the field of battle is absolutely ludicrous; does Ferrill not realize that Europe just emerged from several centuries of warfare with pike-and-shot? By the mid-17th century the scales had tipped decisively in favour of firearms (that were even less effective and easy to use than those deployed by the Anglo-Dutch forces). There seems to be a stunning ignorance of the development of military tactics, as well as a seeming refusal to credit any improvement to those after Alexander.\n\n&gt;Macedonian phalangites would have been vastly superior to British infantrymen in hand-to-hand combat. Alexander’s skirmishers would have been more effective at Waterloo than they were in antiquity. Bows and slings had a longer effective range than muskets, and, since warriors of the early nineteenth century wore little armour, arrows and slingstones would have done relatively more damage. The likely performance of Macedonian cavalry against British stirrups is perhaps more debatable, but the quality of Macedonian horsemanship was high, and the Macedonian cavalry lance was a fearsome weapon, French lancers caused the British so much trouble on the field at Waterloo that in the following year the British organised their own lancer units.\n\nI'm not sure Ferrill realizes that European militaries had dedicated skirmishers as well, that were armed with rifles. All of this is so silly... does he think that the only development in cavalry warfare between 330 BCE and 1815 was the stirrup (which harkens to another historiographical debate...)?\n\nI'd love to hear other “thought experiments” like this, to be honest. Once you throw all context and history out the window, any military force can conquer another one, no matter how advanced. Subutai would've won at Stalingrad. Yi Sun-Shin would've destroyed the Royal Navy at Jutland. Hannibal's elephants would've broken out at Sedan. We can all enter a brave new world of terrible historical fiction. ",

Din't he just literally say that the Maya were influenced by the Aztec? Isin't that a trait from both?\n\n\nSo now that the entire movie to Mr. Buff is based on an assumption that its the classical era when the movie goes out of its way to show that its actually the post-classical era, lets see what else he cooked up.\n\nAssumption #2 - How can smallpox be existent if its the classical era and Spain isn't even a country!!! \n\nYes, this videos first freak out is over the idea that smallpox existed in the classical era and that would be ridiculous.... if this film wasn't actually set in the post classical era... By the time the film is set Columbus is on his fourth voyage. Now the actual historical inaccuracy is the first recorded outbreak of smallpox on mainland america actually happened in 1429, around 20 years after this films setting. Its unfortunate that this is not brought up :(.\n\n\nAssumption #3 - Mr. Buff - still working under the assumption that this film is based on the classical era literally yells about how this movie does not make sense because Conquistadors are arriving.... well in the post-classical era or 1409 when this film takes place, Columbus was actually on his FOURTH VOYAGE. \n\n\nTL:DR Mr. Buffs makes a silly assumption that this movie is about the classical Mayan period, literally spends a lot of time in the video talking about how it recreates a post-classical Mayan civilization very well and somehow still concludes that this movie is based on classical Maya. I can only assume that he made this decision because without the assumption the video's only sin is that the studio added pig noises to a tapir and Mr. Buffs needed a way to attack Mel Gibson.\n\nVery embarrassing. \n\nApologies for bad English, I'm french. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5aparb/lets_read_a_soviet_history_textbook_together_and/",
        "text": "Hey /r/badhistory.\n\nMy family has a massive library above this room I'm sitting in where my father - a weird man, I'll give him that - collected and gathered a LOT of Soviet era literature in the first decade after the fall of the USSR. We have basically everything you need for a written Soviet era experience - the entire *Great Soviet Encyclopedia*, dozens of books about state atheism, CPSU leaders and history, Russian literature, and a whole batch of history textbooks from the Soviet period. The Brezhnev period, to be more exact.\n\nToday, I've got one of these books on the surgery table to be ripped apart and analyzed to the bone. *\"Contemporary History (1939-1972)\"*, a history textbook for 10th grade students, published in 1973 in Kaunas, Lithuanian SSR. A second part of two textbooks for contemporary history. If you are wondering, over here the term \"contemporary history\" represents the time period from 1917 or 1918 onward. It's easy to see why.\n\nThis is a 250 page book, where 40 pages are dedicated to World War II, 60 pages are dedicated to praising the Warsaw Pact, 50 pages are dedicated to shit-talking about NATO, 40 pages are dedicated to decolonialization and the rest is just propaganda. I'm serious, that is how the book is structured.\n\nSince World War II is a very popular topic on this subreddit, I figured I'll showcase what's written in the first 40 pages, in a section titled simply **World War II**. The rest of the book is uninteresting anyway.\n\nNu, piriot. And as always, I will be trying to translate what's written for you.\n\n###THE FORMATION OF TWO WAR SOURCES. THE FIGHT OF THE SOVIET UNION FOR PEACE AND COLLECTIVE SECURITY\n\nSo this brief section is about the set up for war.\n\n####The rise of disagreements between imperialist countries\n\nI'm actually not making any of the titles up. They are all real.\n\n&gt;One of the most important results of the world economic crisis was the rise of disagreements between the imperialist countries. After World War I, holes appeared in the post-war reorganization of the world. Loser countries wanted to obtain revenge and defeat their competitors. In the capitalist world, relations were, like always, based in imperialist principles - the strong oppressed the weak, lawlessness and dictate reigned supreme. The reason for the rise of tensions was the increased unequal development of imperialist nations both in economic and political influence areas.\n\nThis is the first paragraph of this textbook. This is probably the most communist description of the causes of World War II. The Great Depression fucked everyone over, countries began to develop at different speeds, so revanchism appeared out of nowhere and started increasing tensions.\n\nYea. No irredentism, or need for resources, or alien space bats, nothing. Just that.\n\nOh, and a country can't be lawless and dictatorial at the same time, Soviets. Unless you are talking about yourselves during 1991.\n\n&gt;The fascist countries were the most aggressive.\n\n👌\n\n&gt;They wanted to destroy the first socialist country - the Soviet Union - and, by crushing their imperialist opponents, divide the world between themselves.\n\nI understand that Germany indeed planned to destroy the USSR and put it through a nice case of ethnic cleansing, but neither Japan nor Italy, which were mentioned earlier as fascist (just that I cut that part off, it's uninteresting), were interested in it. Japan maybe, but Khalkin Gol put an end to that, but definitely not Italy.\n\nOh, and Germany wasn't hugely interested in actually \"crushing\" the Allies, same with Japan. Germany invaded France, sure, but they wanted to keep the US neutral and didn't really have a serious plan for attacking the UK. Japan for the most part wanted domination in East Asia, and wiping out the Allies was definitely not on their mind.\n\n&gt;The ruling classes of France, the UK and the US encouraged the aggressors to attack the Soviet Union, hoping that both countries will weaken in the war and they will be able to strengthen their position in the post-war world.\n\nHow did they encourage Germany and Japan to invade the Soviet Union, exactly? By declaring war on Germany and then losing in France? You know, that would actually encourage Hitler to do so by making him overconfident...\n\n&gt;The disagreements between the imperialists, however, did nothing to remove the tendency of an anti-Soviet coalition.\n\nOdd, considering that France and the UK tried to offer an anti-German coalition to the Soviets, but it was the Soviets who declined on the basis of being buddy-buddy with the imperialists themselves.\n\n####The creation of a war source in the Far East\n\n&gt;In September of 1931, the Japanese army started war actions and in three months occupied Manchuria. The Kuomintang clique led by Chiang Kai-Shek did not put up resistance to the aggressor.\n\nActually, it took them five months. And no, the Republic of China did try to resist the Japanese occupation. [Like here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_at_Nenjiang_Bridge)\n\n&gt;The League of Nations discussed the question on Japanese aggression for over a year, but did not take action.\n\nThis is actually true.\n\n&gt;Since a source of war tension appeared in the Far East, the Soviet Union did action for strengthening it's defense and brotherly help for the Chinese people.\n\nKhalkhin Gol, right?\n\nFuck no. It's not even mentioned in the book once. I don't even know why. Maybe because the Soviets signed a non-aggression pact with the Japanese and that wouldn't look like a communist enough move.\n\n####Nazi Germany - the most important source of war\n\n&gt;The goals of German fascists were supported by the reactionary American, English and French bourgeois, who wanted to use Germany like a weapon against the Soviet Union and the democratic movement in Europe.\n\nNever mind that most of the democrats in Europe were in the Allies.\n\nOh right. In the Soviet Union, only the communists are democratic. Truly.\n\n&gt;In June of 1935, Germany and the UK made a naval agreement. It allowed Germany to increase it's military navy tonnage by over five times and begin to build a submarine navy.\n\nI thought this was bullshit, but [apparently not.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement)\n\nActually, it still is bullshit. It only allowed Germany to build up a navy of about 35% of that of the Royal Navy, and Germany was unable to reach this tonnage anyway.\n\nBut now we know that the Soviets do their research.\n\n####The fight of the Soviet Union for peace and collective security\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union put a lot of emphasis on the problem of disarmament. Participating in the international conference for disarmament, the Soviet Union offered a principle of *complete international disarmament*. But the imperialist nations declined this proposal.\n\nOkay, this one is actually bullshit. They might be talking about Maxim Litvinov and his stance on disarmament, but he wasn't the one to propose it. \n\n&gt;From the tribune of the League of Nations, the Soviet diplomacy, led by M. Litvinov, declared the principle of \"an indivisible world\", saying against the plans of imperialists to divide the world.\n\nNever heard of this.\n\nIn general, this entire section is taking Litvinov's thoughts and putting them as the official stance of the Soviet Union, even though that was far from the case. Hell, Litvinov was removed in 1939 in favor of Molotov, who promptly signed a non-aggression pact with Germany - this textbook was sure to never mention that. I mean, the M-R Pact is there, but...\n\n###FASCIST AGGRESSION IN SPAIN AND ETHIOPIA\n\nSadly, this page is missing from my book, so I can't present it to you. All you need to know is this: Western allies are bad and purposefully tried to kill the Spanish republic, the Axis, supported by the Allies, sent 200 000 troops into Spain, while the USSR, the good guy in this entire story, tried to help the poor Spaniards, but failed.\n\n###THE FORMATION OF AN AGGRESSIVE BERLIN-ROME-TOKYO AXIS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF FASCIST AGGRESSION\n\n####The creation of a fascist country bloc\n\n&gt;In October of 1936, a deal between Italy and Germany on united action on main questions of foreign policy and dividing Central and Southeast Europe by spheres of influence.\n\nActually, there only were some preparations for a future Rome-Berlin Axis in that month. I also haven't heard of dividing Southeast Europe by spheres of influence, but it could be true.\n\n-insert Anti-Comintern Pact here-\n\n&gt;In July of 1937, Japan attacked North China and invaded the country on a wide front. Japanese actions made a threat to British and American interests in the region, but they did not take any actions.\n\nKek.\n\nThe US and UK provided loan assistance to China and sent volunteers (when the Soviets withdrew, by the way). I'm pretty sure the US oil embargo on Japan also played a big role.\n\n&gt;Washington and London hoped that Japan will soon attack the Soviet Union.\n\nAs I said, Khalkhin Gol don't real.\n\n####Fascist Germany annexes Austria\n\n&gt;The ruling classes of England saw Germany as the \"Western fortress against Bolshevism\" and gave it freedom of action in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nMmkay. \n\n&gt;The UK, France and the US accepted the Anschluss.\n\nThey were pretty passive-aggressive about it though.\n\n&gt;The Soviet Union strictly denounced the aggressive actions of Germany and offered to create an international conference for the collective defense of countries that were in danger of aggression. But the Western countries, standing in favor of deals with Hitler, once again declined the proposal.\n\nnope. Didn't happen.\n\n####The Munchen Plot. Nazi Germany annexes Czechoslovakia\n\nI'll summarize:\n\nNazis are dicks\n\nThe Sudetenland had a tiny minority of Germans ([yeah, no](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Sudetendeutsche.png))\n\nThe USSR offered help to Czechoslovakia, and even though everyone in Prague was singing The Internationale, they declined because they are bourgeois, and thus dicks\n\nThe Munchen Plot was an anti-Soviet meeting disguised as a peace conference\n\nThe Czechoslovak Army was almost as big as the entire German one and was better armed, but they gave up because bourgeois plot!\n\nThe US didn't participate, but they supported this action like the bourgeois that they are\n\nFrance and the UK hoped that by giving Hitler Czechoslovakia, they'll appease him enough to finally attack the Soviet Union, but they failed\n\nMmkay.\n\n####English-French-Soviet negotiations\n\n&gt;Reactionary historians say that the Soviet Union did not out enough effort to create a military agreement with the Western Allies.\n\nAs in, not at all. They were more focused on negotiating with Germany at the time.\n\n&gt;Facts show something else. The governments of Chamberlain and Daladier did not want to make a treaty, rooted in the principles of equality and common understanding. They wanted to use this treaty as a pretext to force the Soviet Union to enter a war with Germany. The Soviets did not have good English and French guarantees.\n\nok.\n\nThis is sort of true, I guess.\n\n####German-Soviet non-aggression pact\n\n&gt;The Soviet government knew that Hitler did not cancel his plans of invading the Soviet Union, and his offer was just a standard maneuver by the fascist leadership.\n\nSo then why did the Soviet Union send thousands of tons of resources to the Germans every year in exchange for some tank technology that they found to be useless? And why did Operation Barbarossa turn out as such a big surprise to them?\n\nOh, and you're damn right there is zero mention of the agreement to divide Eastern Europe into two spheres of influence. Why would there be, come on? The Soviet Union is the good guy in this war! They wouldn't hurt a fly!\n\nShit, we're not even at the actual war yet and this post is already long...\n\n###THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR II\n\n####The causes of World War II\n\n&gt;World War II was started by imperialism. Seeking the highest revenues, imperialists constantly participated in aggressive wars. The great imperialist countries sought to conquer foreign territories, enslave other nations and rule the world. The fight of imperialist murderers was especially tense due to the inequalities between capitalist nations.\n\nI feel like we've been here before. Have we been here before?\n\n&gt;German and Japanese imperialists wanted to destroy the Soviet Union and turn the Soviet people into slaves.\n\nNow all we need is ethnic cleansing and we'll get the whole Generalplan Ost package.\n\nOf course, Gulags where the Soviet people were already slaves are left out of the story. We're the good guys, come on!\n\n&gt;The biggest disagreement in the development of the world was still the disagreement between socialism and capitalism. Reactionary forces planned an invasion of all imperialist nations against the Soviet Union. But there were disagreements between the two blocs of imperialist countries, which put an obstacle to a united attack against the Soviet nation.\n\n*Russian Civil War flashbacks infensifies*\n\nYeah. You heard it. Everyone wanted to conquer the USSR in those days.\n\n####Nazi Germany attacks Poland. \"Phoney war\" in Western Europe\n\n&gt;In September 1st, the fascist German army invaded Poland.\n\nFinally, we get to the actual war!\n\n&gt;115 French and British divisions did nothing, having only 23 German divisions in front of them. The ruling classes of France and Britain hoped that Germany will attack the Soviet Union after Poland.\n\nThey pulled the division count from the Nuremberg Trials, were one German officer explained that Germany would've been fucked if the French decided to attack in 1939. But that doesn't mean that they wanted the Germans to attack East instead - there were other resins. Like WW1 flashbacks. \n\n...\n\nAnd being pussies, I guess.\n\n&gt;Immediately after the Nazi attack, the Polish government shamefully fled and escaped, leaving the nation on their own.\n\nLol wut\n\n&gt;Workers, organized around the Communists, were in the first line of defense\n\nWhat\n\n&gt;The Nazi invasion into the East was a threat not only to the Soviet Union, but also to the peaceful inhabitants of Western Ukraine and Belarus. Seeing this threat and knowing that those territories were unjustly incorporated into Poland by force, the Soviet Union set out to protect the Belarusians and Ukrainians and their wealth.\n\nYes, and the fact that it was a military invasion where thousands of Soviet and Polish troops died is bourgeois propaganda, comrade.\n\n&gt;The Western Allies provoked Finnish reactionaries into an anti-Soviet avanture. But the defeat of the Finnish army in 1940 and a peace treaty between the USSR and Finland put an end to the plans of a worldwide imperialist organized coalition war against the Soviet Union.\n\nThis has been the Winter War through the eyes of the Soviets. Seriously. That's it.\n\nDo I really need to say anything? Especially when the annexation of the Baltic countries is not even mentioned?\n\n####Fascist German attack in the West. France capitulates\n\n-insert Denmark and Norway here-\n\n&gt;The push of Nazi aggression into the West meant a complete crash of the Munchen policy. The anger of the people forced Neville Chamberlain to resign.\n\nOh, yes, the unwillingness of the Labour party to participate in a Chamberlain government is really some public outrage. Right? Nah.\n\n&gt;The \"miracle\" of Dunkirk can be explained by Hitler not allowing his generals to crush the English, hoping to make a peace treaty with England and obtain her help in attacking the Soviet Union.\n\nOkay, USSR, we get it.

And everyone thinks you're sooo important and always plans how to crush you or destroy you in every single moment.\n\nSeriously, according to the Soviets, the Soviet Union is a fucking Mary Sue.\n\n&gt;The French people and army were full of vigor to fight with the enemy. The communists demanded to form volunteer units and start the right of the whole nation for independence. But the government of industrialists and bankers betrayed France's national interests.\n\nOk\n\n&gt;The new government was led by one of the leaders of French Fascists - Marshal Petain.\n\nPetain was not a fascist.

        "text": "There was expressed interest in an earlier thread, so I here give this subreddit my first submission in over 2 years. I broke open an old book I was given in high school. \n\n\n-----------------\n\n\nHave you ever wondered if Big History’s interpretation of the Second World War is wrong? Are experts really morons? Do you want a Very Smart uncle to give you the real facts? Look no further!\n\nThe book *World War II: The Rest of the Story and How It Affects You Today* is a grand little book. Part of a series of history and economics books by “Uncle Eric” (the persona assumed by Richard Maybury for them), this book takes the form of a series of letters between a niece/nephew, and their Very Smart uncle, Eric. They are essentially directed at children, but aren’t marketed as just books for school-aged children. \n\nI would note that some badhistory is simply a matter of missing or misstated facts, such as confusing dates. Some of it is downright insane, such as Hawaiian dreadnoughts and volcano worship. The best (or worst) badhistory, to me, has always been that which is written to assist those with an ideological axe to grind. As an old friend of ours once remarked, “All history is politics anyway”. Maybury is a very good example of the last category, as his anti-war/conservative/libertarian/’Juris Naturalist’ politics is probably a bigger influence on the book than any research he may have ever done. \n\nSince the contents Maybury’s book (7 parts, 61 chapters) are presented in categories and not chronologically, I will discuss opening chapters, and then chapters of parts 2, 3 and 5 of the book here to specifically focus on his writings about the USG (United States Government, his preferred term for the Roosevelt administration) and its role in WW2. There is a lot of other material in this book that could be covered. Sane appreciations of history are lacking everywhere. There is everything from Genocide Olympics (and a land alternative, where evil is measured by how many square miles you conquered over another guy) and false equivalence to second opinion bias, ‘Never invade Russia’ because winter will kill you, Stalin throwing bodies at the Nazis, history is written by the victors, and what I can only think to call ‘New World supremacism’. But I will restrain myself. \n\nNow, to be fair to Maybury, it is not like he hides his intentions. He is upfront about not being objective. And if the history he wrote wasn’t so nuts and insulting to the very nature of truth, I might not bother to care much about how he frames things. He is not pro-Nazi, he condemns them, but his insistence on them being no worse than anyone else could be called piecemeal Nazi apologia. Maybury is broadly critical of everything to do with the American government, not surprisingly, given his domestic leanings of very small government and conspiratorial outlook. And naturally, he cannot write about the Second World War without the US gov’t being a party of substantial blame, and every action taken not subject to scrutiny of a paranoid style. And Roosevelt. Wow, does he not like Roosevelt. \n\n##**Big History, False Equivalence and Background to War**\n\nMaybury’s narrative of the war can be illustrated fairly well by the following from chapter 3, wherein Maybury opens by criticizing the prevailing understanding of the history of the war, and proceeds to dispute the notion that the sides of the war can be sorted into “white hats against black hats”. \n\n&gt;&gt;Neither side was the good guys, unless we define ‘good’ as the side that murders the fewest millions. In that case, the Axis would have been the good guys, which would mean America was on the wrong side…the only ethical choice in either world war was to stay out of them.\n\nHe will continually reiterate this point: There were no good and bad guys. The Nazis were no worse than anyone else. How does Maybury come to this conclusion? Because Hitler didn’t kill that many compared to Stalin and the British. That’s not the first part of the argument, to be clear. That is everything. There is very extensive genocide Olympics framing the notion of who was most evil. He isn’t that concerned with a ranking, though, as much as he just wants to dismiss the differences and declare everyone as bad as everyone else in the Old World. Genocide Olympics is, of course, very lazy. \n\n&gt;&gt;We are led to believe that Americans were fighting for good and against evil but this was simply not the case. Americans thought they were fighting for good against evil because their government told them so, and they trusted their government… I think on both sides it was about the joy of power, the fun of beating people into submission\n\nNote: It is the Roosevelt administration’s propaganda that led the American people to thinking they were on the good side. \n\nSo, with that, our Very Smart uncle must now inform us of what really happened. For starters, he will explain why Roosevelt really allied with the Soviet Union.\n\n&gt;&gt;Yet President Franklin Delano Roosevelt backed Stalin. Why? We cannot read FDR’s mind. My guess is that it was because Stalin was socialist.\n\nWhat? The entirety of American-Soviet cooperation is explained because FDR really liked his socialist comrade Josef? That is not only ignoring that FDR wasn’t thrilled with partnering with the Soviet Union, it’s just downright insulting to any real history of the war. And it’s not like Maybury goes on. No, that’s it. The US sided with the Soviet Union because the Soviets and the Democrats are socialists and thus like each other. He will say this more than once. \n\nIn our much more boring reality, the US and Soviet Union found themselves on the same side of the war with reluctance and tension. Roosevelt made necessary overtures after Nazi expansion, and Lend-Lease would come into effect by 1941, and aid would flow after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. This was not fiery passion between two socialist lovers, but a slow process of necessity since the US recognized the unique threat of Nazi Germany. For reasons that Maybury cannot grasp given that his entire analysis of the Old World is everyone is a mass-murdering empire with a large total of war dead, the Americans actually thought the Nazis were worse than the Soviets in terms of threats to peace. \n\nBut in Maybury’s world?\n\n&gt;&gt;World War II was mostly a battle between two forms of tyranny – fascism and socialism – and the USG sided with the worst of the two, Stalin’s Soviet Socialists. \n\nAll right, then. Industrialized genocide doesn’t count for what it used to, I guess. \n\nLet us check on the Pacific theater though. Maybe there, Maybury isn’t as forgiving to the Axis and critical of the other side.\n\n&gt;&gt;Tojo was doing the world a favor by attacking Chiang Kai-Shek\n\nYeah, never a chance of that. \n\nBut why is this good? Because, you guessed it, the Chinese had been killing more than the Japanese. They needed to be put done by the Japanese. This guy writes history books, keep in mind. \n\nBut Maybury’s numbers aren’t even right. He writes that the Japanese are responsible for less than six million casualties, total. I am fairly sure he gets this number from Rudolph Rummel. This number, however, is specifically to refer to those killed in Japanese war crimes, not every death associated with the Japanese invasion. Which would be fine, I suppose, if Maybury was consistent. However, he is content at times to go with a low number when it is an Axis power, but when it comes to Chiang Kai-Shek, for instance, the number of dead assigned to him is very high. Why? Because apparently all of the dead of the entire Chinese civil war are blamed on him, specifically. I have no idea how Maybury manages to justify this in his head. My only guess is that it is because Hitler was an anti-Socialist.\n\nMost of the rest of the first part of the book is dedicated to dealing with the Allied powers one by one and discrediting any sort of moral high ground they supposedly had. \n\nNow why are all these death tolls important? Because Maybury’s argument of the morally equivalent nature of the war rests on the USG joining a side just as, if not more, brutal than the other. And the false equivalence argument is essential to his entire view of the war. And from here we will really start to come to the bulk of his issue with good old Red Roosevelt. \n\n##**How the War Got Started**\n\nParts two and three of the book handle how the war got started, the second dealing with background of the rest of the great powers, and the third with the US. \n\nConventionally, I believe WW2 is generally said to have started in 1939. Maybury says 1931. I have no problem with this. It is a valid disagreement, and I am sure many would prefer that date since they would find the first Eurocentric. But Maybury’s conception of the nature of WW2’s beginning doesn’t stay in such pleasant realms of reasonable disagreement. \n\nFirstly, it is worth noting that Maybury assumes an understanding of the Treaty of Versailles that would make a member of the leftist ‘self-declared anti-imperialist’ crowd stand up and applaud. Yes, our Very Smart uncle blames the United States for the Treaty of Versailles and that treaty for the WW2 in Europe. \n\n&gt;&gt; Backed by this awesome U.S. firepower, the Allies were then able to impoverish and humiliate the Germans with the Treaty of Versailles. The German hunger for revenge became World War II. Nice work. The USG’s ability to turn small wars into bigger ones borders on the miraculous.\n\nAmerica, of course, receives outstanding blame for the whole thing. I would recommend Samuel_Gompers’ post about Versailles and Hitler, [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1mdpbn/the_usa_had_the_biggest_influence_of_power_which/cc8aksv/), since it is very informative. There is a lot wrong with Maybury’s quick little assertion, but most obviously there is its denial of agency to the German people. \n\nNow is where things get fun. In part three, Maybury will discuss how the US got into the war. But first, two diversions along the way that he finds relevant, and I have to relate.\n\nFirst, I just want to give you all this beautiful line:\n\n&gt;&gt;Even today, the word Dunkirk sends shivers down the spines of the English\n\nAny English reading this get a good Halloween shiver? \n\nNow, let’s get to talking about Europe and who liked really the Nazis. \n\n&gt;&gt;…the Hollywood version of history points out that Italy and Germany were fascist, and then allows us to assume the rest of Europe was anti-fascist and desirous of liberation. Not so. If you visit Europe you will see fasces in the art and architecture of Vienna, Paris and many other cities and towns outside Germany and Italy. Fascism was the European political philosophy for thousands of years and was popular all over Europe.\n\n????????? \n\nDid you guys know the French Republic was fascist?\n\nOr look at [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/French_fasces_00.jpg). Clearly it is just dying to fly off and away and just go decorate Hitler’s house. \n\nOh, and [this guy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Lincoln_Memorial.jpg). Obviously fascist. \n\nMaybury is not, to be clear, merely saying that fasces would be common in WW2 and this meant you had fascists there at the time. He means fasces anywhere in Europe, today or before WW2. In an earlier book of this, about Rome, Maybury asserted that the history of the West since the fall of Rome has more or less been empires trying to reclaim its glory. Fasces are truly invariably going to thus be a symbol of fascism. In addition to telling us of how fascist Western Europe was, Maybury spends time discussing how socialist Eastern Europe was. And to be clear, he is still upset the USG helped the latter win. \n\nOkay, diversions over. \n\nAccording to Maybury, the USG “had every opportunity to avoid war”. The Germans were dying in Russia. The Japanese having fun in Asia. The US could have done its own thing, content to nod solemnly about just how terrible the Old World is. Why didn’t this reality transpire? Our old friend, Red Roosevelt. \n\n##**The *Panay* Incident** \n\n&gt;&gt;In 1937, a group of U.S. Navy ships led by the gunboat *Panay* was escorting merchant ships…in China…On December 12, 1937, Japanese planes attacked the group, sinking the *Panay* and three oil supply vessels.\n\n&gt;&gt;The *Panay* incident…happened two years after the Neutrality Acts in which Congress that forbidden the President to use the U.S. armed forces to protect people who had taken the risk of entering a war zone. \n\nThe attack itself isn’t described inaccurately, but Maybury’s earlier bizarre notion that the ships were there as part of a global policeman-style interference campaign is nonsensical. The gunboat was there protecting Americans and their property, and doing so legally. As far as the Neutrality Acts are concerned, Roosevelt did not legally violate them. China and Japan were not formally at war, so they were not covered under the Neutrality Acts, though I am unclear as to even if the law did apply (at this time in 1937), it would have prohibited the gunboat from being there doing what it was doing. The lesson from this incident is that Roosevelt wanted to bring the US into war, and he was willing to act the part of a dictator over Congress (by violating the neutrality law) to get it. Not that the supposed provocation against Japan worked. \n\n##**Pearl Harbor**\n\nBut *Panay* is a small matter. Maybury dedicates plenty of time to Pearl Harbor, starting in chapter 21:\n\n&gt;&gt;In the final paragraph of his December 8th speech asking for a declaration of war, President Roosevelt said this attack was unprovoked. Was it? In this and my next few letters we will look at the evidence.\n\nIn chapter 22, Maybury prefaces his explanation of why Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. His statistics of America’s industrial capacity compared to Japan is correct. America had vastly superior industry that, once at war, outpaced Japan’s war production quickly and strongly. He is not wrong that the Japanese’s intentions at Pearl Harbor were to conduct a highly successful attack and make immense progress as fast as possible so as to avoid the negative consequences that would come one the US was truly up and running to fight the war. However, all of this, to him, is to make out Japan as “the rabbit” that “will fight if cornered”.  The provocations against Japan had been growing for four years according to Maybury and Japan was not going to sit by. The exact list of provocations that Roosevelt used, you ask? Well...\n\nIn chapter 23, Maybury writes:\n\n&gt;&gt; [Lt. Commander] McCollum believed the U.S. should get into the war to help Britain defeat Germany…McCollum, a navy officer, believed something should be done to change the minds of the American people, and the away to do this was to goad the Japanese into attacking U.S. Navy ships. We have no way of knowing how much McCollum talked with Roosevelt or how early they began planning to provoke a Japanese attack. We do know that in 1940, McCollum circulated a memo containing this eight-point.\n\nNow, this plan did exist. McCollum did write an eight-point plan that outlined eight steps that could be taken to bring the US into greater involvement in the Pacific, even writing that “if by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.\" The problem for Maybury’s case comes in that there is absolutely zero evidence that this memo ever reached Roosevelt. Maybury, rather unconvincingly, even tries to list the eight steps alongside an actual timeline of events, to know Roosevelt’s conniving hand. Maybury actually does write that \n\n&gt;&gt;The steps were not taken in the same order as listed in the plan, and some were taken before the memo was circulated.\n\nAlmost as if maybe the memo wasn’t the driving force of the entire US policy towards the Pacific, and McCollum was drawing on widely considered and natural options that were going to unfold in the real world, and indeed already were. \n\nAs far as the attack on Pearl Harbor itself is concerned…\n\n&gt;&gt;Few are willing to face the possibility that the President…planned it all. \n\nYeah, I wonder why so few think about that. Must be the popular nationalist narrative overriding sound judgment. Maybury discusses the attack on Pearl Harbor at length, across many subsequent chapters. An entire post could easily have more than enough material to knock at, since it has everything from the US having already broke the codes to Roosevelt siphoning off planes to further hurt the base’s defense. \n\n##**Roosevelt**\n\nBut we start to get to the true crux of the evil behavior of the USG now. Why did Roosevelt provoke Japan? What was his motivation behind leading the US ever more into a war that was between equally terrible great powers? \n\n&gt;&gt;There was no reason to single out the Japanese except for the fact that in 1931 they happened to be the bullies most easy to provoke. They were highly dependent on oil, and Roosevelt had the ability to cut off their oil…Why did Roosevelt do it? We will never know for sure…But my guess is that he knew the Germans were in trouble and he wanted into the war before it ended. Afterall, what is the point of spending your life trying to acquire power if, once you have it, you cannot use it on someone?\n\nSo Red Roosevelt cut off Japan’s oil, not because they were using it to slaughter the Chinese or aggressively expand across Asia, but because he wanted to feel powerful. Glad we cleared that up with Maybury’s ‘guess’. But why did Roosevelt want to bring the US into the war overall? This is addressed in part five, wherein Maybury offers a “suggestion” as to the motivations of Roosevelt. Now, from when I read this thing for the first time some years ago, I remembered most of it, at least in the broad strokes. One thing I forgot was his nickname for Roosevelt. I will give the most relevant section below, in all its magnificent glory: \n\n&gt;&gt;…Roosevelt made the war much longer and much more bloody. Why did he do it? We will never know, we cannot read his mind, but I can offer one suggestion. Remember Churchill’s remark to Roosevelt that I mentioned in an earlier letter: “I am half American and the natural person to work with you. It is evident that we see eye to eye. Were I to become Prime Minister of Britain we could control the world.”\n\n&gt;&gt;America was protected by the two giant moats called the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. There was no serious threat to American industry, while whole industries in all other major nations were being bombed, shelled and burned. My guess: Roosevelt realized that if he could keep the war going long enough, all the other major nations would pulverize each other, and he would end up emperor of the world. \n\nAll hail Emperor of the Americans, Europe and Asia, Lord Regent of the Whole World, Protector of the Globe, Warmonger of the Great Pacific Ocean, Breaker of Congress, Father of the Flying Tigers. \n\nFor anyone who isn’t clear: No, Roosevelt did not enter the war and then prolong it in order to have the rest of the great powers thrash themselves so he could rule over the ruins of the planet. Yes, when it was over the US was truly in a far, far stronger position than the rest of the world’s nations, and the US channeled its capacity into rebuilding the international order, with everything from the IMF to the Marshall Plan to the United Nations being crafted, and other institutions such as NATO. It’s always been my understanding that many American libertarian sorts really hate the role the US has been playing in the postwar era, but nowhere else have I heard that the US deliberately prolonged the war so as it could assume such a role as global policeman, as opposed to, you know, the actual reality of the US realizing what was needed/possible and acting accordingly after the fact. Being critical of the US’ international role is one thing. Butchering history to suit your ideological agenda is another. And when you deviate into “the Nazis were bad, but no worse than anyone else in recent history or contemporarily” territory to do so, you rouse my scorn. \n\n\n-----------------\n\n\nThere are many, many other posts that could be made about this book. Maybe I will choose one of it's minor themes at some point, or someone more knowledgeable than me could attempt to handle the economics or logistics arenas. Regardless, I will content myself to finish with a few notes about the last, sixth, part of the book. It is not so much history, as (R5-forbidden) modern politics, but that is precisely why I want to briefly comment on it. If Maybury just wanted to be a guy with fringe political views, he could have contented himself to expand this final section into a manifesto and make that the book. You can of course gather he hates US interventions and American exceptionalism, and warns against them. The worldview presented there is, naturally, the result if you learn the lessons Maybury wants you to from his odd recounting of history. And this is the merely the last book in a series of eleven that illustrate the history and economics of the West. I am categorically not buying the rest. \n\n",

Remember that Spain ultimately expelled the Moors, was a European superpower for much of the 17th century, and conquered most population centers of what is now Latin America - a tough feat to pull off, clearly, if Spaniards are lazy and self-indulgent. Spain has also historically been a major center of culture, from Don Quixote to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia to Picasso. How is the country lazy and self-indulgent again?\n\n&gt; being so obsessed with the superiority of their own culture, the Incas did not pay any attention at all to developing and spreading it.\n\nThis is also ridiculous. The Incas were a *new* empire, for one thing, having emerged only in the 15th century. They absolutely had to be determined to develop and spread their culture and empire because, being a *new empire*, they wouldn't have become an empire otherwise. The Incas were also great adapters of foreign influences. There is influence in pottery styles from Chimu and other pre-Inca peoples, for instance. The sapa inca, Atahualpa, planned on making a Spaniard-influenced army, while the Inca government-in-exile in Vilcabamba made iron weapons. \n\nThis also raises the question, even if the Incas were \"obsessed with the superiority of their own culture\" how did Spain ever conquer them since Spaniards are so lazy and self-indulgent?\n\nThese parts were removed in 2007 when the Spanish embassy in South Korea discovered them and informed the Seoul of its... annoyance at the characterization. \n\nBTW this textbook had a masterful knowledge of science as well: \n\n&gt; Spinach used to grow in harsh terrain. But now they are grown in greenhouses with plenty of fertilizers, making them taste bad since the spinach no longer make an effort to overcome their difficulties. Similarly, modern teenagers are weak because they grow up in greenhouses. \n\nOn the necessity of working hard instead of being lazy:\n\n&gt; If you want to sleep, you can do that once you are in your grave",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/59s2y1/in_which_jas_townsend_and_son_incs_special_guest/",
        "text": "[Source: Why Are Hops Used In Beers? - Q&amp;A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW8y4pbYTkI)\n\nThis is a very short video (2:50 with intro) but the guest (Brian Nagel, brewmaster at Genessee Country Village &amp; Museum) still manages to screw up pretty badly.\n\nThe first howler is when he states that hops aren't used in brewing until the 1400's - the first known reference to hops in connection with brewing is in an 822 manuscript, and another, more definite source dates from 1150. (Kinda ironically, this last one indicates that they were brewing *with* hops by talking about a beer brewed *without* hops). A bit later but still earlier than the 15th C, the cities of the Hanseatic League were exporting hopped beer by the 13th C at the latest, and there are tax records for imported hopped beer in England by the mid 14th C. \n\n[Sauce for the previous.](https://zythophile.wordpress.com/2009/11/20/a-short-history-of-hops/)\n\nNext up is an odd one - he says \"normally you don't see hops used in ales, only in beers.\" This one is confusing as hell to someone who doesn't already know wtf he's talking about because in current use, ales are a subset of beers, specifically a top-fermented beer, as opposed to a bottom-fermented lager. The thing is, until relatively recently, \"ale\" and \"beer\" referred to two different things, the first flavored with gruit (a mix of herbs and spices) and the second with hops. As time passed and hops became ubiquitous in brewing, the words changed meaning and \"ale\" meant a less-hoppy drink compared to the hoppy \"beer,\" then somehow became associated with pale brews, and these days you'll ironically find non-beer people saying they can't drink ales because they're too bitter - probably a result of the current fashion for both top fermenting and generous hopping in enthusiast beer. So while the statement might be correct or at least not incorrect in some technical sense (and I honestly don't know what he was getting at in that statement anyway) it will be very confusing for someone who isn't aware of these changes and cause someone who does to question why they're watching a couple of ~~cosplayers~~ *reenactors* talk about this stuff in the first place.\n\nNot bad history? I beg to differ. Any history that obscures instead of illuminating is bad.\n\n[Sauce for the previous.](https://zythophile.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/look-will-you-all-stop-misusing-the-word-ale-thank-you/)\n\n\n",

        "text": "As Lithuanian pseudohistory seems to garner some interest here, I thought to expand a bit on Gedgaudas, especially because I find /u/Augenis post to be… questionable at few points.\n\n\n**/u/Augenis errata (of sorts)**\n\n&gt;I just wanted to get it out there that popular history doesn't really exist in Lithuania.\n\nDepends on your definition of \"popular history\" I guess, but I find this statement to be nonsense.\n\n&gt;This thing I'm doing - **writing blogs about pseudohistorians** [...] are unheard of in Lithuania. I don't want to call myself a pioneer, buuut... \n\nAnd you should’t, because you are not.\n\n&gt;Anyway, back to Gedgaudas. A little bit of historical background about this person - a diplomat, politician, translator, polyglote,\n\nHe was neither of above. The closest thing to diplomatic service was the time, then he was employed by Foreign Ministry as interpreter for few years. \nAs for *polyglot*, well... his book shows that he knew Lithuanian, English, French and Russian. Albeit, extent of his mastery of these languages can be questioned- for example he seems to do not differentiate plural and singular of шпора (Russian for spur). Given, that he lived in Lithuania, France and USA his linguistic skills does not seem to be exceptional or noteworthy. \n\n&gt;Upon being released in Lithuania in 1994, the book garnered a solid fanbase, and \"gedgaudistai\" (\"Gedgaudists\") survive among **Lithuanian professional historians** as a polity to this day \n\nI dare you to name at least one. No, seriously, if you going around accusing  professional historians of supporting Gedgaudas writings, you should bring some proof (also, meaning of *polity* is *any kind of political entity*. Just thought you should know).\n\n&gt;Gedgaudas, for one, had noble intentions - he believed that the history of Lithuania is purposefully being tugged into Slavic territory and that the current historiography in Lithuania focuses too much on history after the coronation of Mindaugas and thus the creation of the Lithuanian state, both of which were absolutely correct during his time. \n\nDo you even read what you write?\n\n**More on Gedgaudas** \n\nOne of the core ideas of Gedgaudas (introduced, appropriately, in the middle of the book) is the denial of proper nouns in the past. Essentially, he was introduced to etymology at some point of his life, but didn't understood it very well:\n\n&gt;In ancient times surnames, nation and tribe names did not existed as abstractly as we understand them today.[…] Then in 9th century chronicle we find Šventivaldas, we must understand that it is not his „name“ in modern meaning, but simply his „occupation“- to rule saintly. In same way Liaudų- vykas (Liudvig, Lius) is „professional defender of people“.\n\nThe same goes for tribes/nations: Vandals were simple river boaters, for example.\n\nNeedless to say,  proper nouns did existed even in most ancient times and it should constitute a problem for Gedgaudas, as under his conception it seems that boaters, tar makers, slave catchers and so on not only lived separately, but also had separate rulers and waged wars separately. Gedgaudas amends this problem by ignoring it entirely.\nHence, Roman empire was pushed out from Africa by bunch of boaters. \n\nIn addition, differences between tribe, nation, linguistic group and archaeological culture are incomprehensible to Gedgaudas, hence distribution of Balts in Bronze age (as proposed by Gimbutiene) equals to ancient Lithuanian empire.\n\n/u/Augenis mentionded re-Lithuanization, that is main tool in Gedgaugas tool-box. Essentially, Gedgaudas started with **a priori** conclusion that everything was Lithuanian, hence if something does not look or sound as such, it just corruption due time passage or evildoers (that is Polish). Majority of the book is based on  re-Lithuanization of two Renaissance authors: Jean Bouchet (*Anciennes et modernes généalogies des rois de France*) and Johannes Trithemius (Gedgaudas uses compilation of his works *Opera historica* published in 1966): bout of whom he considers to be different versions of the same ancient Lithuanian chronicle.\n\nWell, Lithuanian is probably not the best word because Lithuanians are merely a fragment of whose ancient people, but Gedgaudas himself was unsure how to call them, so he mostly just went by with „our ancestors“.\nTo understand Gedgaudas view of history is nearly impossible- even to Gedgaudas himself apparently, as his book contains unholy amount of distortions, contradictions and plain WTF. \nFew years ago I tried to make chapter-by-chapter rebuttal of this book. I gave up. \n\nInstead, I just give you what I consider to be *the best of Gedgaudas*:\n\n* 1975 AD was 3462 in Tauroja (Troy) years\n* Names deriving from word Lithuania, includes, but are not limited to: Laetorum,  Letes, \nLites, Letovici, Leudes, Lodeve, Llydaw, Luttich, Lothroc. \n*  Lithuania itself derives from Liaudai (word coined by Gedgaudas from liaudis (folk, people) and supposed to mean something like hirdsmen)\n* Roland, Olivier and the gang were Liaudai.\n* Vladimir the Great conquered Riga. Anna Porphyrogenita was in fact Rikneda, daughter of the ruler of Riga.\n* Pizza was brought to Italy by Ostrogoths.\n* Ostrogoths, Avarians, Bulgarians, Khoresmians and Medes are, in fact, the same folk.\n*  Ostrogoths were Slavic.\n*  Ostrogoths were Lithuanians.\n* Caligula, Vespasian, Titus and Augustulus are all distorted Lithuanian names.\n* Romans were difenetly **not** Lithuanians. In fact, they were arch-enemies of *Amber Road Empire*.\n* Some of the Argonauts were Lithuanians.\n* Tacitus visited Baltic coast.\n* Aedui were also not a tribe, but a profession. They were panhandlers.\n* Linguistic legacy of Lithuanian Vandals include: admiral and mate (naval offices), mast, segel (German for sail) and catamaran (unsurprisingly, as ancient Polynesians were Lithuanians).\n* Golgotha is a Lithuanian word.\n* Gothic style was invented by Lithuanians in what-is-now Ukraine somewhere around 600 BC.\n* Every single depiction of a man on the horse is Lithuanian legacy. **EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.**\n* Same goes for heraldic eagles.\n* Fleur-de-lis is an ancient Lithuanian symbol. It depicts eagle.\n* Can you guess who was Carthaginians?\n* Hawaii and Easter island are ancient Lithuanian lost colonies.\n* Pharaoh Sesostris plundered Ukraine (I think Gedgaudas uses Vesosis and Tanausis story as a basis).\n* Catharism, Arianism, Mithraism and Slavic paganism are the same ancient Lithuanian religion. It was monotheistic faith.\n* Christianity is Bolshevism-like uprising against that ancient and noble religion.\n* John 1:1 is stolen from the said  ancient and noble religion.\n* Most importantly of all: German scholars are **EVIL**. Not as much as Polish, though.",

It wasn't about killing people, it was simply a contest of strength.

People absolutely never killed eachother with their bare hands, it was all about competition guise.\n\n&gt;But now, people kill one another left to right with knives and what have you. Wasn't always like that. Even if we did have tribal warfare. Although even then people were killed far less often than they are now. \n\nOnce again, it \"wasnt always like that\". User continues to forget current population differences and population density as compared to when we were living in caves.\n\n&gt;I mean, even in the \"Wild West\", the worst towns like Dodge city had about four shootings every year. \n\nhttps://cjrc.osu.edu/research/interdisciplinary/hvd/homicide-rates-american-west\n\nFor instance, the adult residents of Dodge City faced a homicide rate of at least 165 per 100,000 adults per year, meaning that 0.165 percent of the population was murdered each year—between a fifth and a tenth of a percent. That may sound small, but it is large to a criminologist or epidemiologist, because it means that an adult who lived in Dodge City from 1876 to 1885 faced at least a 1 in 61 chance of being murdered—1.65 percent of the population was murdered in those 10 years.\n\n\n&gt;In WW2, only 2% of soldiers actually shot to kill people.

My last post here kinda blew up, at least by my standards - who could've thought that talking about badhistory about Lithuania not actually being Slavic is a subject that interests you? Sure, the everyday post about Rome or American badhistory still seems to get more karma, but hey, it's not a competition.\n\nIt's also not a competition on which one of our subjects is filled with crazy badhistory, crazy enough to make you wet your pants.\n\nToday, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, people and Slavs of all ages, I present to you - \"Mūsų praeities beieškant\" (\"Searching For Our Past\") by Česlovas Gedgaudas!\n\nSome of you may be thinking: *Whaat? Another work by an actual historian? Why don't you pick on popular history from time to time, /u/Augenis?*\n\nOkay, you are probably not thinking that. I just wanted to get it out there that popular history doesn't really exist in Lithuania. We don't have many of our own history journals nor a lot of history television (and when we do, it's made by actual historians). Hell, history is considered to be a very, whatsthename, *elitist* science. This thing I'm doing - writing blogs about pseudohistorians, or writing alternate history in my free time - are unheard of in Lithuania. I don't want to call myself a pioneer, buuut...\n\nAnyway, back to Gedgaudas. A little bit of historical background about this person - a diplomat, politician, translator, polyglote, as well as writer of a few history books that left people cringing. Born in 1909. Lived in Interwar Lithuania. Father was an artillery officer who later died in a Soviet prison. He was a diplomat, worked in the foreign ministry, had to watch as Poles and Russians tried to delete Lithuanian history in Vilnius and the rest of Europe. Managed to flee Soviet occupation, settled down in Chicago, and then California, where he died. \"Mūsų praeities beieškant\" was released in Mexico City in 1975, not long after the works of Marija Gimbutienė, whom he cites a lot in his works. Of course, upon realizing what kind of shit she has been invited into, Gimbutienė declined the offer to collaborate on the book (plus, her views were not Baltophilic enough), so Gedgaudas wrote it alone.\n\nUpon being released in Lithuania in 1994, the book garnered a solid fanbase, and \"gedgaudistai\" (\"Gedgaudists\") survive among Lithuanian professional historians as a polity to this day, though most of them merged into the so-called \"Sarmatians\" (Lithuanian history researchers who believe that the Sarmatians, and sometimes the Scythians, were Balts).\n\nGedgaudas, for one, had noble intentions - he believed that the history of Lithuania is purposefully being tugged into Slavic territory and that the current historiography in Lithuania focuses too much on history after the coronation of Mindaugas and thus the creation of the Lithuanian state, both of which were absolutely correct during his time. The problem is that he went too far.\n\nWhat does he propose in \"Mūsų praeities beieškant\"? Well, strap yourself in for a ride:\n\n* According to Gedgaudas, all written and archaeological evidence points to a massive, continent-spanning Baltic nation that existed in some shape and form from about 1000 BC to 1200 AD, and which was the main force in shaping European history since this day.\n\n* Lithuanians are the Aryans, who formed in the Middle East around 1500 BC. The first Baltic nations were Urartu and the Hittites.\n\n* During my time reading the book, I held a slight suspicion that Gedgaudas does not believe in the Proto-Indo-European language, and in the end, he revealed this belief to be absolutely correct. Paraphrasing: \"Some wretched linguists try to cover up this mass of Lithuanian influence by saying that they are just \"coincidences\", rising from a \"proto \"Indo-European\" language\". Idiocy at it's finest\"\n\n* You know why? Most, if not almost all of the arguments presented in this book are created using the well-tested method of \"ear linguistics\". Basically, you take a word from any language, be it English, German or Chinese, find (or make up) a word in Lithuanian that sounds similar, then proudly declare that the word originates from Lithuanian. Crazy, right? Here, I'll give you a demonstration, using an excerpt from the book:\n\n&gt;Linguistics clearly tell us that we were the first to invent horseback riding and the equipment that comes with it, because our ancient name for saddle - SĖDYLA (which, by the way, is not a real word, I checked) - was given to Eastern and Western Europe - Slavic *sedilo*, German *sattel*, English *saddle* show a clear direct connection, but the later Latin distorted word *sella* is shortened and gave way to Spanish *silla*, French *selle*.\n\n* Crazy, right? Of course, since Lithuanian is *obviously* the oldest language in the non-existent Indo-European branch, that means every single word in all of these languages comes from Lithuanian and never, and I mean *never*, the other way around.\n\n* Gedgaudas, however, takes this one more step and outright \"relithuanizes\" supposedly distorted ancient names to fit his agenda, and he does it with a fiery passion. Who could have known that Genčiarikis is Genseric, Vada Rikis is Odoacer and Varumanių Rikis is Ermanaric? Sometimes, even when the owner of the name itself calls himself by the \"distorted\" name in his texts, like, say Jordanus, he relithuanizes them anyway - in this case to Girdonis.\n\n* And apparently, in the old days there was no such thing like \"tribe names\", only professions. Burgundians are slave catchers, Vandals are seafarers and Aesti are traders. All Balts.\n\n* Okay, back to what is actually written there. Gedgaudas constructs an entire history of the Baltic people and presents it in this book, and I will try to write it down for you as cohesively as possible:\n\n* Persia was actually inhabited by Prussians, and Persepolis is a distorted name for Paršpilis (Pig-Castle).\n\n* Troy (Tauroja) was a Lithuanian city, and it's inhabitants fled across the world. Some settled in Europe, some crossed the god damn Atlantic and gave civilization to Native Americans, most notably the Maya. Also, Lithuanians were in Hawaii and Easter Islands, too.\n\n* Thracians and Phrygians were Balts, as copied from Basanavičius and explained in the first part of this series\n\n* A list of other ancient cultures who are confirmed to be Lithuanian (or Baltic): Phoenicians, Carthage, Goths (Guds), Scythians (also Guds), Sarmatians (Šermačiai), Cimmerians (Gemariai). Baltic forces participated in the Pelopponese Wars and allied with the Greeks against the Persians. Who, as said before, were also Balts, just Prussians.\n\n* Alexander the Great was half-Gud and half-Thracian, so 100% Baltic. He conquered Persia and settled Gemariai by the Indus River, who would go on to found the Gupta Dynasty. So India is also at least partially Baltic.\n\n* While all of this was going on, the Baltic tribes of Visigoths (Vyčiai-gudai), Ostrogoths (Ostro-gotai, later Slavs), Heruli (Gerulai), Cimbri (Gemariai), Ruthenians (Rasai), Dacians (Dakai), Lithuanians, Jotvingiai and Franks (Liaudai) formed a tribal union, which later coalesced into the first Baltic nation in Europe - the Empire of Varumanių Rikis. [Here is a handy map](http://www.sarmatas.lt/wp-content/uploads/zmlpstr.jpg).\n\n* The \"Migration Period\" is a hoax. In fact, it was actually an active and successful Baltic conquest of the Western Roman Empire. After settling in these newly conquered territories, the Balts started all major European cultures, nations and dynasties - Spain, France, Italy, Germany and North Africa, to name a few. Vada Rikis (Odoacer) was the ruler of this short-lived \"Lithuanian Empire\" between the Atlantic and the Volga. The teachings of Islam (Moslemas) were rooted in the beliefs of the Baltic Aryan religion, too, brought to Arabia through North Africa, a Baltic controlled region.\n\n* After Vada Rikis's great Lithuanian Empire collapsed, the territories of Eastern Europe were disunited for a few centuries, until reunified by Varių Rikis (Rurik), who founded the Second Empire - Empire of Gardarikė (Gardariki), also known as the Supreme Kievan Crown, or the Kievan Rasa (Kievan Rus'). The Rasai were centered around Kaunagardis (Kiev), and founded Gardarikė to unite all of Eastern Europe for a few centuries, until the traitorous Vladimir, of the Slavs, persuaded the Kievan Crown to accept that evil Christianity and their beliefs.\n\n* Instant civil war. Kievan Rasa began to Slavicize, while the Aryan North, centered around Lithuania, fought against it. It was a brutal civil war until in 1253, Mindaugas of the Lithuanians was elected Emperor of Kievan Rasa, briefly reunited while facing both Western crusaders and Mongol hordes, and that's where the \"history taught in schools\" starts...\n\n* Oh, and the Vykingiai (Vikings) were Balts, too. Suck it, Sweden.\n\nSo...\n\nUh...\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nI guess... you can already tell that this is one hell of a ride...\n\nI will leave the mass for you, while I pick on some smaller problems to fulfill that R5:\n\n* Gedgaudas believes that Arianism (a Christian heresy) and Aryanism (a religion he made up as supposedly being the religion of the Balts) are the same thing. They were not.\n\n* Gedgaudas contradicts himself by saying that Odoacer was just a general of the Baltic Army who went overboard and settled in Italia, while at the same time saying that he was the emperor of the entirety of Europe.\n\n* Gedgaudas says that there is no evidence of any Germanic influence in Spanish or French surnames and place names, thus proving that the Visigoths and Franks are not Germanic tribes. Take that as you will, but would he really be able to tell that the German Ludwig, and French Louis are actually the Frankish Chlodowig (also the first Frankish king)? Not when he's trying to prove their Baltic origins, of course...\n\n* Relithuanization. Relithuanization makes no sense. Seriously. I will give you some examples from this book:\n\nVespasian - Viešpačionis (why would a Roman Emperor be Baltic?)\n\n[Swietopelk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swietopelk_II,_Duke_of_Pomerania) - Šventupuolis (doesn't make sense in his story - according to him, by that time Poland was deeply contaminated with Slavs)\n\nCentaurs - Kintavyriai (seriously, he thinks that Lithuanians were the Centaurs. I'm not joking)\n\nLaetorum, Lettes, Lothroc, Llydaw, etc. - Liaudai (the only thing they all have in common is that they start with the letter L)\n\nBorussi (from the Song of Roland) - Prussians (Gedgaudas uses this to prove that the Prussians fought alongside the Franks. Too bad that in the Song of Roland, the Borussi fought *on the Muslim side*.)\n\nIs that enough?\n\n* According to Gedgaudas, the Ostrogoths were the ancestors to the Slavs, trying to explain their absence from any historical work until the 6th century or something. There are problems arising from this bold claim - Slavs were mentioned earlier than that, just not under the name \"Slavs\". Jordanes accurately mentions that the Venedi, Antes and Sclavini (Slavs) are ethnonyms of the same tribe, and the first two names can be seen in Tacitus's work and earlier. Of course, when you don't believe in the Migration Period and thus don't accept that the Slavs only arrived to written record range (i.e. the Balkans) in the 6th century, you need an another explanation...\n\n* Gedgaudas also states that the Balts and Slavs were once one and the same. Okay, this one is actually correct. What is going on?..\n\n* Gedgaudas says that Sweden was an inhospitable land and couldn't possibly support enough population for the Viking invasions, thus Gardarikė was the one to send them. Okay, and we're back. You do know that it wasn't just Sweden who organized Viking raids, right? Also, the population for Sweden in the 9th century that he gives - 400 000, - doesn't sound too correct.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI made a map of Gedgaudas's Earth: [Color coded for your pleasure](http://i.imgur.com/EUGUApC.png)\n\nThank you for reading.",

The first professional army (which he probably meant) was arguably instituted by Philip II of Macedon with soldiers and cavalrymen paid for their service year-round, rather than a militia of men who mostly farmed the land for subsistence and occasionally mustered for campaigns.\n\n\"...and created the greatest empire the world has ever seen.\" - ...[Very debatable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires)\n\nWhat he followed up is even worse:\n\n&gt;The Roman Empire is seen by many historians as the first TRUE superpower, latter it would be Great Britain, then the U.S.S.R and the United States. Rome lasted for 600 years, Britain lasted 200-300 years (depending one when you think Britain became an empire), and the Mongols are a little more complex. They did conquer a lot of land, but the hordes split up the conquests, so it was never under the control of one centralized government.\n\nI mean besides being too vague to define \"true superpower\", it sounds like he's saying there was a huge between gap between the Roman Empire and the British Empire. Why is he ignoring outside of Europe? Various dynasties of China was certainly influential to that stage. Why he's ignoring empires that came before like the Achaemenid Empire?",

        "text": "Edit: Material that's a tad more badhistory than that in the example image. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/6Jlnu) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/KtLow). \n\n---\n\n\n\nIn an discussion about the ethnic diversity in Game of Thrones, we somehow turned to the sacking of Rome, and someone was quick to point out that [\"nearly all of the Islamic world was won by war and conquest\"](http://imgur.com/a/dlB46). \n\nWhere to begin.\n\nAn acknowledgement that there is no knowledge divorced from it's seeker is a good place to start, meaning if you're looking to be right about something, enough to put some degree of blinders on, you're going to find enough evidence to convince at least one other person you're right about something. It could be something as small as unintentionally lumping certain groups together -- Persia and the Hijaz have a very different history with respect to Islam and conquering, but putting them under the umbrella of \"the Islamic world\" allows you to ignore that -- to simply ignoring evidence that contradicts your beliefs, even when presented to you. And it's easy to think that everyone else is dumb and you're informed, but that's how we get bad history. So in putting this post up I acknowledge that i'm as susceptible to bad history as the next person, and we're just here trying to make sure that everything makes sense. \n\nAnyway, onwards.\n\nThe obvious issues are the conflation of Islamic Empires like the numerous Caliphates with some monolithic-capital-I-Islam, in addition to implying by omission that the \"Western world\" (how I hate that term) was apparently not won by war and conquest? It's also just disingenuous to suggest that any majority religion in the world today has not, at some point in time, committed violence against \"outsiders\", be it forced conversion or forced relocation etc. \n\n\nFollowing is a list of wars borrowed from a top of all time post written by /u/ColeYote \"not 'started by a Muslim nation being the aggressor'\", to my knowledge (with the possible exception of the wars in the Pacific Islands, my knowledge of the region is sorely lacking) there was a redrawing of boundaries and borders, indicating taking-land-by-war-and-conquest. \n\n* World War 1\n\n* World War 2\n\n* The Korean War\n\n* The Vietnam War\n\n* The 100 Years' War\n\n* The 80 Years' War\n\n* The 30 Years' War\n\n* The 9 Years' War\n\n* The other 9 Years' War\n\n* The 8 Years' War\n\n* The 7 Years' War\n\n* The other 7 Years' War\n\n* The Crusades\n\n* The Mongol Conquests\n\n* The Napoleonic Wars\n\n* All wars fought prior to 610 CE, that being the approximate date Islam was founded. This of course includes the not-exactly-insignificant number of wars fought by the Greek and Roman empires\n\n* All wars fought in the Americas\n\n* All wars (that I know of) fought in the Pacific islands\n\nThere are other examples of religions/empires/religious empires that \"spread using violence\". \n\nTheodosius is a good example of religion, in the Pre-Islamic Era, so no one can argue they were simply \"adopting the means by which Islam spread\". The doctrine of Nicean Christianity was proclaimed orthodox (iirc prior to the Nestorian/Monophysite schism) and all pagan religions were banned, and heresy was punishable by death. Non-Niceans were removed from office and the government allowed the destruction of Temples, Holy sites, and objects of worship. [Wiki/Personal Knowledge]\n\n\nKartir of the Sassanid empire is another great example. He was unbelievably harsh on non Zoroastrians, and began to expel the Manacheists and Mazadakists who were chilling fairly peacefully in there. He wasn't as harsh on the Jewish Christians, and we definitely see an explosion of Jewish culture at the time (cf. the expansion of Rabbinical Judaism and the dual revelation model). [Daniel Brown's \"A New Introduction to Islam\" Ch. 3/4]\n\nA source I like to suggest as a counterpoint to the \"Islam is the most dangerous/violent/crazy etc\" is Karen Armstrong's \"Fields of Blood\". Unlike most of her other works, this one is less narrative and a lot more historical review, with other cultures and empires taking the forefront. \n",

        "author": "Commustar",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/58if2g/bbc_africa_made_a_short_video_about_queen_njinga/",
        "text": "[Here is a link to the video in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPyy9gsu86Y). It was made as part of BBC Africa's ongoing series of short films about *African Women You Need to Know*, implying the films are meant to be of some educational value.\n\nUnfortunately, this video contains lots of oversimplifications or misleading statements that leaves the viewer with some very mistaken impressions. \n\nSince the video relies on title cards, quoting the misleading statements and explaining them is actually quite easy, so here goes...\n\n&gt;0m 15s- She was the monarch of the Mbundu people....\n\nThe Ambundu (Northern Mbundu) and Ovimbundu (Southern Mbundu) were not organized into a single unified  nation-state. She grew up in Ndongo, which was a Ambundu kingdom, and went on to rule Matamba which was another Ambundu kingdom. But there were several Ambundu and Ovimbundu states which retained their own monarchs while she was alive, so she should not be called \"THE monarch of THE Mbundu people\". \n\nShe was A monarch of A Mbundu kingdom.\n\nI feel the distinction is very important, because there is a widespread perception that African societies were divided into tribes. When the video refers to \"the Mbundu people\", it allows the viewer to skate on that perception, and think of them as \"the Mbundu tribe\". [Africanist scholars don't view tribe to be a meaningful concept](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/31o2nt/monday_methods_definitions_of_tribe/cq3hm52), and so some effort by the video to depict the true political complexity of Mbundu societies could have informed lots of people.\n\n&gt; 0m 43s- Year: 1622 | The Portuguese established a settlement at Luanda, encroaching on Mbundu land\n\nAgain, this reinforces the narrative of Mbundu as a tribe. The conflict narrated in this vignette was between Portugal and Ndongo, which was the most powerful of the several Ambundu kingdoms at the time.\n\nAlso, Luanda was founded in 1576, and so would be ~45 years old at the time of Nzinga's negotiation. The negotiation she had with the Portuguese resulted in their promise to withdraw from an inland fort.\n\n&gt; 0m 48s - King Ngola Mbandi sent his sister to negotiate a peace treaty. \n\nThat statement gives the impression that her brother's name was Ngola Mbandi. In fact, that is a title. I'll quote Joseph C. Miller^1\n\n\"[Nzinga] first appears in the historical record in 1621 or 1622, when she arrived at Luanda claiming to be the emissary of her brother, the Ngola of the time, a noble known by his title of the *mbande a ngola*...\"\n\nIn this sense, the word Ngola denotes leadership, so calling him \"King Ngola\" is a bit like saying \"Emperor Shah Reza Pahlavi\" or \"King Pharaoh Thutmoses III\" or \"Emperor Mansa Musa\" (Mansa was a Malinke title for a military leader) or \"Emperor Qin Shi huangdi\" (Huangdi is a leadership title) which is to say, needlessly redundant.\n\nAlso, a note about her being \"his sister\". In English her relationship would be better described as half-sister. She and the reigning Ngola were both children of the previous Ngola, through different mothers. In Mbundu reckoning, Nzinga would not be considered kin to her half-brother, though she appears to have called herself the sister of the Ngola in order to play up her claim to power on his death.\n\n&gt; 1m 19s - four years later she became Queen of the Mbundu.\n\nWe've already covered why \"queen of the Mbundu\" is a dumb statement.\n\nBut, notice how sparse the details are in that statement? What happened to her brother? Was she the next in line to inherit the throne? Was she swept to power because of her excellent diplomacy? Quoting Joseph C. Miller again.^2\n\n\"Within two years of her portentous visit, the *mbande a ngola* had died under mysterious circumstances, Nzinga had claimed his title as ruler of the kingdom....But the brilliance of her meteoric rise should not obscure the subtle indications that she received little loyalty from the Mbundu farmers of the state and she probably seized the royal title in the face of opposition from the dominant internal political factions in the kingdom.\"\n\nMiller goes on to explain a schema of succession in Ndongo where kinship lineages would accumulate loyalty from farmers and village leaders, and on the death of the monarch, these lineages would mobilize this network of loyalists to demonstrate the manpower and prestige of their chosen candidate, and the candidate which could mobilize the largest number of supporters was recognized as the next ruler.\n\nA byproduct/feature of this system is the expectation that the loss of a leadership struggle was only a temporary setback for a lineage, and an expectation that kingship would alternate between lineages.\n\nThere is a lot of intricacies to unpack here, but Miller proposes that Nzinga was seen as a usurper who took power in a palace coup.\n\nIn order to strengthen her position, she seems to have sought recognition and support by turns from the Portuguese in Luanda as well as the lineage-less Imbangala who dwelt to the south of Ndongo.\n\nShe did rule Ndongo from about 1624-1629, but she was forced out of power by those other lineages which felt shut out of power by her unusual rise to power.\n\nIn an act of political survival, she then took what supporters she had and trekked to the Matamba kingdom to the east of Ndongo in 1629. In the prior century Matamba had established a precedent of having female rulers, and Nzinga was able to draw on that earlier precedent to legitimize her effort to become queen of Matamba. She would succeed in her efforts, and would rule Matamba until 1663, turning the  kingdom which had formerly been a vassal state to Ndongo into a powerful realm in its own right.\n\n&gt; 1m 26s - Through her life, Queen Njinga led her army against the Portuguese and refused to allow them to control her nation\n\nI've already pointed out how she sought Portuguese support in 1624-25 to maintain her hold on power in Ndongo. Inconveniently for her, a change in the Portuguese governor resulted in a change in Portuguese policy towards Ndongo and an abrogation of the treaty she negotiated in 1622, as well as Portuguese support for a rival candidate for Ngola of Ndongo.\n\nLater, as queen of Matamba, she got some amount of payback against the Portuguese for their failure to support her, when she colluded with Dutch efforts in the 1630s to capture Luanda in exchange for expanding her control over portions of the Ndongo kingdom.\n\nThis was only temporarily successful, and when the Portuguese returned she quickly realigned her policy to seek a rapprochement with the Portuguese in the 1650s. She was quite successful in this effort, and she was able to secure promises that the Portuguese would support her designated heir as the queen of Matambe against any Imbangala (another former ally turned enemy) efforts to put their claimant on the throne.\n\nWith all that context, let's jump back to a claim early in the video...\n\n&gt; 0m 31s - She fought against the Portuguese and the expanding slave trade in central Africa.\n\nLike her shifting attitudes towards the Portuguese, she had different policies towards slavery and the slave trade depending on the political situation that she was in.\n\nIn the period where she ruled Ndongo, it is true that she harbored slaves that had escaped from Portuguese plantations. Miller proposes that this was part of a strategy of propping up her unpopular rule by accepting outsiders that had no connection to the Ndongo lineage system, turning them into her power base.\n\nLater on, the expansion of the slave trade into the Matamba kingdom functioned as a source for luxury goods which allowed her to build up a powerful army, and made Matamba a powerful state. Again, the selling of slaves was circumscribed by political considerations, and while she was soured on the Portuguese in the 1630s and 1640s she seems to have steered slave exports through the Kongo Kingdom to Dutch traders.\n\n&gt; 1m 37s - In Africa, Njinga's struggle has been an inspiration in the struggle for independence\n\nThis part is true. Both MPLA and UNITA forces in the Angolan civil war cast her as a proto-nationalist heroine.^3 \n\nBut, we should be aware that the implicit motivations of the independence movement to draw on historical precedent for their anti-colonial struggle. Viewing her story through that anti-colonial lens encouraged a one-sided perspective of her as a \"defender of the nation\" committed to consistently anti-Portuguese, anti-slave trade agenda, rather than seeing her as a political actor who followed a changing set of policies in to protect her legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n1. \"Nzinga of Matamba in a New Perspective\" by Joseph C. Miller in *Journal of African History* Vol. 16 no 2 (1975) pp 203.\n\n2. Ibid pp 203-204\n\n3. \"Legitimacy and Political Power: Queen Njinga, 1624-1663\" by John K Thornton, in *Journal of African History* 32 (1991) pp 25.\n\nA note about sources- I rely heavily on Joseph Miller's interpretations for this post. His article was from 1977, and represents the first revisionist attempt to look at Njinga/Nzinga from a Mbundu perspective of political legitimacy. There has been much discussion since 1977 regarding whether his framing of her as an illegitimate is justified. John Thornton argues in his article that changing political circumstances (portuguese political interference, growing power of court slaves) undermined the traditional system, and make efforts at determining \"legitimacy\" or \"illegitimacy\" unrealistic in a changing system.\n\nAll of that is to say, though there have been arguments about perspective, historians don't really argue *against the idea* that she alternated between alliance and hostility towards Portugal and Imbangala, or that Matamba engaged in the slave trade under her rule.\n\nEdit- changed \"historians dont really argue that she alternated\" to \"historians dont really argue *against the idea that* she alternated\" in last sentence",

        "title": "Was medieval Lithuania actually \"the Grand Principality of Litva\"? Today, we rip apart Belarusian national pride (sorry)!",
        "author": "Augenis",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/589cgx/was_medieval_lithuania_actually_the_grand/",
        "text": "Sup /r/badhistory. \n\nA bit less than a month ago, I [presented to you the crazy ideas of a Lithuanian historian](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5446b8/the_story_of_rimantas_matulis_the_lithuanian/) and ripped them apart as absolute rubbish. Today, I decided to take on a bigger fruit - the absolute biggest fruit in the entirety of Lithuanian badhistory.\n\nToday, I am presenting you the \"Slavic Lithuania\" theory. Or, in this case, Slavic Litva.\n\nIf anything, this is the most *dangerous* set of badhistory I've heard of, at least in Eastern Europe. You know why? Because it is considered to be the actual history in the whole nation of Belarus. Poor guys... The idea that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a Slavic, particularly a proto-Belarusian, state was first popularized by [Mikola Yermalovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikola_Yermalovich) in the last decade of the Soviet Union, as well as the early post-Soviet period. Yermalovich is considered to have been a capable historian that revealed the truth behind \"Litva\" in Belarus, but he is seen as a fringe historian whose works rely on cherrypicking evidence and sometimes completely alternate history here, in Lithuania.\n\n[Here](http://mynativebelarus.blogspot.lt/2012/06/why-belarus-is-lithuania.html) is the Slavic Lithuania theory condensed into a single short article for any of those who are not following, with all their arguments presented there. To refute them, I will rely on my own knowledge as well as the article [\"Shadow of a Fictional Lithuania\"](http://www.voruta.lt/pramanytos-lietuvos-smekla/), in Lithuanian.\n\nOh, and by the way - I do not condone any harsh feelings towards any of you Belarusians. In fact, it's great to see that you uphold the history of the Medieval Lithuania period as much as we do, it was important to both of us! And I will concede from the start that it was as much of a Belarusian (well, proto-Belarusian, anyway) state as it was a Lithuanian one - we are guilty of stealing your noble families and considering them ours, etc.\n\nBut we have to learn to share...\n\n###Argument 1 - \"The state language of Litva was Ruthenian, so Litva was a Slavic state! Their inhabitants were Litvins!\"\n\nThis is less badhistory and more bad history interpretation. Indeed, the **chancellery** language of medieval Lithuania was Old Church Slavonic. Nobody argues with that, even the annals of Lithuania were written in it. The problem is that it is applying a 19th century interpretation of nationality to the Middle Ages. In the Medieval Era, your nationality was not determined by which language you use, but rather by which country you live under. As such, all inhabitants of Lithuania at the time - whether Baltic, Slavic or whatever - were called \"Lithuanians\". This \"Litvin\" (Slavic inhabitant of GDL) identity didn't stick, by the way - by the time nationalism arrived, everyone was quick to separate to Lithuanians, Belarusians and Ukrainians.\n\nOh, and about Old Church Slavonic. It is painful for me to say this, but at the time - huegh - the Balts were on a lower civilization level than the Slavs. As in, the Slavs were already Christianized and with it brought things like, a written language, a more organized government, more developed trade, etc. Slavs composed the majority of Lithuania's population, so it's obvious that even a Baltic Lithuania would use a Slavic language for their literary matters.\n\n###Argument 2 - \"\"Lithuania\" is actually Zhmud, which only joined Litva in 1413!\"\n\nThis. This is actual badhistory.\n\nIn 1411, not even the correct date, Samogitia (which is what they are referring to) was *reincorporated* in Lithuania. Vytautas the Great (whose cult of personality in Lithuania will be left for another time) gave Samogitia to the Teutonic Order in the Treaty of Lyck and later in 1404 to gain their support against his cousin Jogaila in his struggle to obtain the throne of Lithuania. Of course, to give something to the Teutons you have to own it...\n\nSamogitians were in medieval Lithuania [since the times of Mindaugas.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Lithuanian_state_in_1251-1263.PNG) (for those unaware, it's the territory with Medvėgalis), and participated in numerous Lithuanian campaigns against the Teutonic Order, so yeah.\n\nNot buying that. Oh, and we are not Samogitians. Samogitians are bad enough. Too much redneck.\n\n###Argument 3 - \"The nucleus of Litva was in Slonim and Minsk regions!\"\n\n[Handy map of what they are claiming.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Litva_%28Yermalovich%29.svg)\n\nThere are numerous ways I can refute that. I could point to, for the sake of it, unbiased foreign researchers who deny this. I could refute this with Teutonic sources that state Lithuania is between Livonia and Prussia. I could point to Russian chronicles which say that Lithuania *conquered* these regions.\n\nBut here's how I do it. I will point to the *first mention of the name of Lithuania in history*. And how even from the very start of Lithuania historiography it is false.\n\nAnnals of Quedlinburg, 1009.\n\n\"[In 1009] St. Bruno, an archbishop and monk, who was called Boniface, was slain by Pagans during the 11th year of this conversion at the border of *Russe* and *Lituae*, and along with 18 of his followers, entered heaven on March 9th.\"\n\n*Lituae* is very clearly Lithuania. *Russe* can be two things - either Kievan Rus', or a distorted name for Prussia.  Let's test both of these theories.\n\nIf Russe is Rus', then Lithuania cannot be in Slonim-Minsk, because, well, it would be *in Rus'*. In addition, if Lithuania was in the Kievan Rus', then there would be no reason for Saint Bruno to head there to baptize pagans, because the Eastern Slavs were already baptized!\n\nIf Russe is Prussia, then Lithuania still cannot be in Slonim-Minsk, because there is no way Prussia would extend as far as to reach modern day Eastern Lithuania.\n\n###Argument 4 - \"Wilno only became the capital of \"Lithuania\" in 1939, when Stalin gifted it\"\n\nFalse.\n\nVilnius became the capital of modern Lithuania in 1918, upon the Act of Establishment of the Republic of Lithuania. That's where the seat of the Council of Lithuania was, as well as the first Government right before the Wars of Independence. Only after the Bolshevik invasion, when Poles got to Vilnius first, did we lose the city.\n\nWe regained it for a little while during the Polish-Soviet War, too. So no. \n\nOh, and by the way, what was the capital of the Bolshevik-created Soviet Lithuania in 1918? Also Vilnius. So that also counts.\n\n###Argument 5 - \"Litva was a Grand Principality!\"\n\nYou ever noticed how I use the term \"medieval Lithuania\" instead of \"Grand Duchy of Lithuania\"? No, not because I am a patriot.\n\nIt's because using the term \"Grand Duchy of Lithuania\" to refer to Lithuania before the Union of Krewo is not correct and mostly a product of Soviet historiography. Sure, while it is a Grand Duchy, the rank of it's title is far higher than that of a Grand Prince.\n\nFor the most part, the pagan Grand Dukes - Gediminas, Algirdas - referred to themselves in letters to foreign countries as \"kings\". Gediminas, when writing a letter to the Pope, called himself \"king of Lithuanians and most Rus'ians\" (*Gedeminne Dei gratia Letwinorum et multorum Ruthenorum rex*). Pope John XXII first called him \"the one who calls himself king\", but later started calling him \"king\", too. When writing to the Patriarch of Constantinople, Algirdas called himself \"basileus\", though this was likely because of religious matters (from the point of view of Algirdas, the Patriarch in Constantinople is overseen by the Emperor of Constantinople, so the \"Patriarch\" in Kiev is overseen by the \"Emperor\" of Kiev, so the Grand Duke of Lithuania).\n\nPhew...\n\n---\n\nPhew...\n\nDoes this make sense to you? I was going to make this a post about common Lithuanian badhistory in general, with this one as the top one, but it turned out so long...",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/57y2qi/the_holy_war_of_1066_how_william_the_conqueror/",
        "text": "Being as it's the 950th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, there's no shortage of hackery hacking away at the battle from all sections of the media, but while skimming an otherwise [totally innocuous article](https://www.howitworksdaily.com/the-battle-of-hastings-950-years-since-1066/) (apart from the bit about the \"Dark Ages\"), I was bamboozled by the reference to the religious affiliations of the key players (that grid thing at the top of page 77). \n\nHow did William managed to be Roman Catholic and Harold managed to be Orthodox?. The Schism was literally 12 years earlier so I guess it *could* be possible, that Anglo-Saxon England was a weird hold-out despite being so far from the direct influence of Constantinople ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIt turns out that there’s a revisionist Orthodox wiki and a ton of revisionist blogs that seems to count any pre-Schism Christians or anti-Rome Christians as being Orthodox on the basis that it was the Satanic Pope of Heresy Town that pulled the church away from the true faith. This is from [Harold II: The Last Orthodox King of England](http://pemptousia.com/2016/10/harold-ii-the-last-orthodox-king-of-england/) on http://pemptousia.com/, which has a pompous mission statement so long as to be utterly unreadable:\n\n&gt;\"The result of the Norman Conquest was that the English Church and people were integrated into the heretical “Church” of Western, Papist Christendom, which had just, in 1054, fallen away from communion with the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, represented by the Eastern Patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem.” \n\n(There’s a ton of seemingly academic essays to this effect on .ru sites, so you don’t have to look hard for ‘verification’ if this is a viewpoint you want to subscribe to)\n\nThe central conceit is obviously nonsense. If there's any corner of 11th Century Christendom that owned its loyalty firmly to Rome, it's the Anglo-Saxon church. I give you *The Medieval Church: A Brief History* by Joseph C Lynch and Phili C Adamo:\n\n&gt;The fledgling Anglo-Saxon church was proud of its ties to St Peter and the papacy. It was the first regional church outside Italy to acknowledge in continuing, concrete ways the religious pre-eminence of the bishop of Rome. In the seventh and eight centuries, a modest traffic in letters and pilgrims moved from England to Rome and back. Anglo-Saxon bishops and kings asked the popes for guidance on difficult questions of liturgy, morality and organisation [...] In short, Pope Gregory's mission had created a church loyal to the papacy at the western fringe of the Christian world.\n\nBut the background for this seemingly arbitrary fringe belief is that the Archbishop of Canterbury - who was particularly close to Harold and is referred to as his chaplain - Stigand, was excommunicated in 1052 for being both Archbishop of Canterbury *and* Bishop of Winchester at the same time. This happened just as Pope Leo IX had turned his eye to the English church and had embarked upon a mission of reform, specifically the buying and selling of diocese.\n\nHarold didn’t exactly clamp down on his transgressions, so William, Duke of Normandy, used that lapse in judgement in his petition to the Pope to recognise him as the rightful heir and Harold as the usurper. William also drew attention to his copious religious endowments in Normandy.\n\nFor Orthodox Pepe, this takes on a more sinister dimension and Strigand and Harold are referred to as martyrs for their faith. Strigand was even excommunicated the same year as the Patriarch of Constantinople!!!! = PROOF!!!\n\nThis is obviously nonsense, as (and I've simplified this considerably for the sake of clarity/sanity):\n\n1. Harold would have ONLY known the Latin rite, not the Greek rite. \n\n2. The idea of “Roman Catholicism” and “Greek Orthodox” wouldn’t appear until much later. The Schism was decades - centuries perhaps - in the making, so when we say it took place in 1054 we’re oversimplifying it. \n\n3. Harold had been on a pilgrimage to Rome as a young man to visit the relics of the Apostles. He brought back a piece of the True Cross (of course he did) for his abbey at Waltham. Harold refused to allow Stigand to consecrate the abbey because he was too controversial, and many English bishops went to Rome to be consecrated. \n\n4. Harold didn’t let Stigand crown him because his claim was fragile and he knew having Stigand do it would be used as a stick to beat him with. The Normans however seized on Stigand in their propaganda and the Bayeux Tapestry shows Harold being crowned by Stigand. So the part of the premise for Harold's Orthodoxy isn't entirely real. \n\n6. Post-Conquest, William didn’t actually do anything about Stigand until 1070. The Archbishop may even have assisted in William’s coronation (but the Archbishop of York performed it, see 4.) and he definitely consecrated William's first appointment, the Bishop of Dorchester. Alone of Stigand's appointments, Dorchester kept his appointment after 1070, while the rest were dismissed by a Papal envoy - thanks to William's protection. Political patronage, not dogma, was the name of the same.\n\n7. Similarly, William did enact reform, yes, but he also took greater control of the appointment of bishops away from Rome and redistributed church land and wealth to his loyal retainers. So, again this \"integration\" Pemptousia talks about wasn't exactly seamless and was driven by patronage.\n\n**In conclusion Harold Godwinson and Stigand were firmly part of the Roman church, as was William of Normandy. There's absolutely no cause to depict Harold or William as belonging to separate denominations because those definitions didn't yet exist, but if we had to they'd be Roman Catholics. Also, William wasn't on a mission to advance Rome's agenda but a smooth political operator who gained a blessing for political expedience and seized control of the English church for his own ends.** \n\n**Sources:** *Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church: From Bede to Stigand* edited by Alexander R.

In 1866, Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey reported that disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses, and attacked and killed black people, leaving their bodies on the roads.\n\n&gt;\"Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites.\" Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/55qjpe/in_which_we_unpack_salons_review_of_peter/",
        "text": "Disclaimer: I have not, and will not, read the book. This R5 is based exclusively on the review. If one of you guys wants to read the actual book and start a thread, you are braver than I, for this looks like a flaming dumpster full of adult diapers.\n\nFor those not in the know, Peter Turchin is the father of Cliodynamics, \"a transdisciplinary area of research integrating cultural evolution, economic history/cliometrics, macrosociology\" (Wikipedia), that seeks to reduce history into mathematical models.\n\n[(Salon) Breaking point: America approaching a period of disintegration, argues anthropologist Peter Turchin](http://www.salon.com/2016/10/01/breaking-point-america-approaching-a-period-of-disintegration-argues-anthropologist-peter-turchin/)\n\nLet's start from the top: The book claims (or, the review claims that the book claims?) that history runs in a cycle of \"social integration followed by disintegration, discord and violence.\"\n\nOn one level, this is a banal observation: Some times there's more unrest than other times. But the claim here is that you can actually quantify this stuff and make predictions based on it. \n\n[Yes, there is a chart.](http://media.salon.com/2016/09/China-Cycles-e1473885371139.png)\n\nHey, I'm going to be super charitable and assume the book actually explains what an \"Index of Political Instability\" means and how he got the data but it doesn't matter: It's dumb and reductive and completely ridiculous and there's just no way in hell he got any kind of valid data for the vast majority of that timeline at all. This chart is arguably better made but not better history than [The Chart](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/darkages.gif).\n\nThe review goes on to quote:\n\n&gt;“The American polity today has a lot in common with the Antebellum America of the 1850s; with Ancien Régime France on the eve of the French Revolution; with Stuart England during the 1630s; and innumerable other historical societies,” Turchin writes. \n\nOkay, yeah: the American polity today has a lot in common with those examples. For instance, it is populated by carbon-based life forms. On the other hand, it is extremely *unlike* them in other ways: for instance, it is not a monarchy, her institutions are more or less designed to respond quickly to public crises and a few dry years in a row means a bunch of loan defaults rather than mass starvation.\n\nOf course, we're all aware than Malthus is pretty much completely discredited by now, to the point where his ideas are used as an Awful Warning about the dangers of plausible theorizing in the absence of data. So it's kind of funny that he should be mentioned in this context; some kind of Freudian slip?\n\n&gt;The ideas of Thomas Malthus — that population growth will exceed growth in agricultural production, leading to mass immiseration — provide one sort of starting point. But civilizations are more than a big, undifferentiated mass of people. Elites can and do prosper while average citizens’ welfare declines, as happened in Victorian England, in our own Gilded Age and again since the 1970s. Elites have their own population dynamics, and can suffer their own equivalence of immiseration when they outstrip their resource base.\n\nAnd further:\n\n&gt;“Structural‐demographic theory represents complex (state‐level) human societies as systems with three main compartments (the general population, the elites, and the state) interacting with each other and with sociopolitical instability via a web of nonlinear feedbacks,” Turchin writes. \n\nFollowed by another stupid chart.\n\nFor Victorian England, I *think* they're talking about the Industrial Revolution or possibly British Imperialism, but what happened in the period was the emergence of *new* wealthy classes of industrialists, financiers and merchant princes rather than the prosperity of a homogeneous \"elite.\" Old money is notoriously uneasy about new money, which they sometimes express by being snooty in Church, sometimes by rewriting the rules to limit their profiteering ways and sometimes by straight-up dragging those uppity motherfuckers into the street and hanging them off the nearest convenient tree branch.\n\nI'm going to skip over a description of what sounds like yet another awful goddamn chart with suspicious data because we've had enough of that. Let's talk about the 50's, that golden age:\n\n&gt;The halcyon days of the 1950s did not reflect a lengthy lost golden age, Turchin argues. Rather, they were a cyclic echo of the “Era of Good Feelings” around 1820, when social discord was at a low ebb, and there was only one national political party — a period that also quickly gave way to new forms of intense social conflict.\n\nSee, here's the thing: The 50's weren't that great. In fact, if you weren't white, male and Republican, they were pretty shitty. And they weren't that great for Republicans either, what with Communists taking over the world and subverting the American government from within, not to mention Russkis with their nukes aimed right at you. It probably looked good compared to having a Great Depression or a World War but that's a hell of a low bar to set.\n\n&gt;The core of the theory in pre-industrial form is that population growth in excess of agricultural productivity gains leads to falling living standards (“popular immiseration”), urban migration, and unrest. It also results in “elite overproduction” — less money for ordinary workers means more for elites, whose numbers grow, producing their own set of problems in the form of intra‐elite competition, rivalry, fragmentation and loss of cohesion. Population growth also leads to growth of the army, state bureaucracy and taxes, pushing it toward fiscal crisis, state bankruptcy and loss of military control, opening the way for elite fragments to rebel and/or mobilize popular resentments to overthrow central authority.\n\nOkay. That sounds vaguely plausible, and also very much like a restatement of Malthusianism, which has as much validity as, say, phrenology. But let's see how it applies in our industrialized world:\n\n&gt;Social integration and disintegration alternate in cycles lasting two or three centuries, overlaid with a shorter 50-year cycle roughly corresponding with two generations, reflecting the fact that social unrest tends to spread, burn itself out, and then rekindle during disintegrative phases: 1870, 1920 and 1970 all approximated such peaks in our own history. America’s long cycle has been more rapid than most, probably due to faster population growth — there was a full cycle from 1780 to 1930, and an incomplete cycle since, each dealt with in separate sections of the book. But there’s surprisingly little difference from the workings of the pre-industrial model.\n\nSee, this is the very *heart* of why this is so wrong (I mean aside from the whole bit with homogeneous \"elites\" and \"masses\" and so on): Get enough random data and you'll find a pattern anywhere you like. Now make up a bunch of data to support your theory (as you demonstrably did in the first chart) and discard the stuff that doesn't fit your model, as follows:\n\n&gt;While the New Deal is considered a turning point by many historians and social scientists, Turchin notes, “When we look at major structural‐demographic variables, however, the decade of the 1930s does not appear to be a turning point. Structural‐demographic trends that were established during the Progressive Era continued through the 1930s, although some of them accelerated.”\n\nSee? All you have to do is say that ($event) didn't really happen in ($decade) because the seeds were planted before. And you'll always be right, because every event always has prequels.\n\nExercise for the reader: Push \"the 60's\" as far back as you can in history. I got it to the 1840's in like a minute and a half.\n\nThere's a ton more stuff but I'm honestly kind of tired of this vapid bullshit.The short version is that it's transparently wrong, reductive nonsense that shoehorns events into this structural cyclical narrative while ignoring all external pressures and events. This is a line of thinking that leads to ignoring actual events in favor of vapid little charts full of made-up data. This sort of stuff belongs to a Transhumanist or Alt-Right blog, and illustrates why Cliodynamics should be treated with all the credibility of Astrology.\n\n",
