        "text": "I realize this topic has been discussed several times already but I couldn't readily find a post covering this relatively recent(2020) study: \"Does ‚Äòactivating‚Äô nuts affect nutrient bioavailability?\" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814620303915](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814620303915)\n\nI unfortunately have no access to the full PDF but the abstract seems to be pretty unambiguous:\n\n    \n- Activating nuts does not result in meaningful reductions in phytate concentrations.\n    - Mineral concentrations were lower in activated nuts.\n    - Activating nuts does not improve phytate to mineral ratios.\n    \n\nWhich I think is interesting and (to me) a bit surprising. Although I have seen claims that soaking could help with issues other than those mentioned in the abstract (e.g. oxalates, traces of mold or mycotoxins) this would seem a pretty strong case against soaking.  \n\n\nWhat do you think?  \nAnd, most importantly, do you soak?",

In this video, Gil clears up a lot of the misinformation and exaggerated claims being made. \n\n\\[Link to the video.\\]([https://youtu.be/4SCaRG3jqS0](https://youtu.be/4SCaRG3jqS0))\n\nIt's unfortunate that news articles misrepresent studies (intentionally or unintentionally) and create a lot of unnecessary fear about the food we're eating. It's made even worse by people with social media followings blindly repeating these articles without reading the actual scientific paper or having the expertise to interpret them correctly.\n\nI think these sort of sensationalised articles contribute to a lack of understanding and trust in science. It's not unlikely that there'll be another study that shows a benefit to erythritol (Gil even mentions a couple in his video), and news articles will be reporting on how great it is. This gives the impression that science 'can't make up it's mind' and is constantly swinging back and forth between what foods are healthy and unhealthy, which is simply not the case.\n\nLayne Norton has also made a video about it \\[here\\]([https://youtu.be/Ad8\\_scQtHFM](https://youtu.be/Ad8_scQtHFM)).",
