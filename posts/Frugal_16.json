I've considered using my local union bank but they are not as \"modern\" as I would like (no Zelle so I can't virtually transfer money to people), and it's a local union bank so it's only in my city. I just need a bank with no fees, accessible atm's in different cities of California, and has Zelle. Also, isn't TOO shitty of a bank (I know most major banks are shitty like BofA and stuff).

Put in a order last month and had a $1.99 restocking fee, and now it's $3.99 just to try a piece on and hope it fits. This is particularly annoying since thredup is Wildly inaccurate about their sizes on items, and items are not flat measured consistently or accurately at all. For $2, I could try on a hopefully lovely jacket and see if it fits well or not.. but $4 to just.. put it on? \n\nI have been recommending thredup a lot lately because between the sales, the ability to sort by material, etc. with the low restocking fees it was worth it for trying on some higher-quality clothing and finding a piece that fits well. Now, to return 3 items you're basically Paying for one of those items outright. The size being inaccurate will not waive the fees either unless the item's listing is inaccurate (i.e. saying it's a small when it's a medium on the tag.. but if it says medium and it's really meant for a size 1 that's not their problem). \n\nI figured if anyone else was using them, it's worth noting this huge change.",

The kitchen is the one who puts it together usually and I know they never see those tips. \n\nI’ve noticed lately that anytime I order anything online or pay by card in some places, even for things like cream or acai bowls, it wants me to tip 20% and won’t leave me an option for anything else. \n\nFor instance, we have an açaí bowl place that I will go to sometimes for my breakfast quick after I go to the gym. They pay their employees 20$ an hour for this because they were able to find employees last year. Now they are requiring 20% tip on order to basically scoop my stuff in a bowl and give it to me. I don’t understand why places can’t just up the price by a couple dollars instead. This person is already getting paid for their job and it’s not a difficult one as I have a family member who works there. \n\nAm I just being cheap and need to shift my thinking? Or is tipping culture in America getting out of control?\n\n-just a note I absolutely pay the 20%+ for actually sitting in a restaurant or delivery. This is just take out orders.",

        "text": "  \n\n**Updates and Changes to “Frugal Finds Friday”**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThe moderation team has been discussing the recent community feedback regarding our beta test of Frugal Finds Friday. The past few weeks have demonstrated that this one-day “bonanza” of haul/find posts can create meaningful conversation and quantifiably causes a positive impact on engagement throughout the subreddit. That being said, many individuals have expressed concerns regarding the quality of these postings and their relevancy/overall contribution to the community. \n\n**So what’s changing?**\n\n**Post Titles**\n\nStarting this week, all hauls or finds which involve savings, prices, or something purchased should include the relative location in the title. Post titles should follow this format:\n\n* \\[Location\\] Rest of Title\n\nThis does not impact salvage finds, roadside finds, or other “unique” situational hauls.\n\nWe don’t want anybody doxing themselves and we want everybody to be comfortable when posting, so you are welcome to keep the location relatively ambiguous. However, it should be identifiable enough that it allows for users in a similar area/lifestyle to compare prices. Examples of titles include:\n\n* \\[Rural New York\\] Rest of Title\n* \\[Auckland, New Zealand\\] Rest of Title\n* \\[Eastern Suburban France\\] Rest of Title\n\nPlease remember, not every post you see on r/Frugal will be directly applicable to you and your specific circumstances. **This is okay!** However, please be respectful of other users and “keep on scrolling” if you feel a post irrelevant to you.\n\n**Contributory Top-Level Comments**\n\nIn conjunction with the post titles requirement, all haul and find posts should include a substantial top-level comment which expands upon your image contribution. This comment should be designed to promote discussion with other users. While this has always been an expectation as part of Rule 6, haul posts will be held to a stricter standard. While this process will be initially enforced manually, it will eventually be automated and all image posts will require a top-level comment within a specific period of time before going live in the main feed. Below are some suggestions for items which can be included/discussed in a top-level comment:\n\n* For grocery hauls, the top-level comment can be a breakdown of the receipt/item prices, discuss the justification/reasoning behind specific purchases, or include tips/suggestions you used be more frugal with your grocery purchase.\n* For roadside finds or salvage hauls, the top-level comment can include a breakdown of how you found your haul, how you intend to use your find, etc.\n\nThese recommendations aren't a hard and fast restriction, they're simply intended to serve as inspiration for your post.\n\n**As always, you're welcome to ask questions or provide feedback below!**",

        "text": "I discovered these a few months ago and now eat tons of them. If you're craving a salty, crunchy snack or salad topping but want something better for you than chips (and half the price of tree nuts), roasted soybeans, fava beans, chickpeas, and peas are fantastic! Like nuts, they are high in protein, fiber, iron, and unsaturated fats. \n\nYou can buy them pre-made online or in some specialty markets. I'm partial to the Sriracha peas I get at the local Korean grocery. Roasted chickpeas can also be made at home quite easily if you have an air fryer. I've used this recipe: [https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/crispy-air-fryer-chickpeas/](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/crispy-air-fryer-chickpeas/). The spice blend can be subbed out for almost anything. A generous scoop of finely-ground za'atar was killer.",

For the price of the Best Western in Palm Springs, you can stay at a *much nicer* independently run hotel or resort in DHS and relax in mineral water hot tubs.  There are both adults only &amp; family-friendly hotels.\n\nAlso, the tapwater in DHS is amazing (and a revelation if you come in from Las Vegas or LA).  No need to pay for bottled water.  \n\n**Eats** \\--  DHS doesn't have much in the way of fancy dining, but they have an excellent Thai restaurant and several choices for good Mexican food \n\nIf you search for \"\\[type of food\\] Palm Springs\", restaurants off of the Palm Canyon/Indian Canyon Drive strip are much more reasonably priced.  (And if you're vegan or vegetarian, there are several excellent restaurants.)\n\n**Things to do that are reasonably priced (or free) &amp; will improve your body and soul :**\n\n* Tahquitz Canyon\n* Angel Cove trail\n* Cabot's Pueblo Museum\n* Palm Springs Air Museum\n* Moorten Botanical Garden\n* Sunnylands Center and Gardens\n* Living Desert Zoo and Gardens\n* Thousand Palms Oasis\n* Whitewater Preserve\n* Cable Car\n* Palm Springs Art Museum\n* Visit one of the many local date farms (which can be expensive if you're not careful because good dates are like crack.)",
