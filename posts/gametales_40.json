For those that don't know, GW2 has large scale world events, often set on timers with specific objectives that need to be completed by different, often distant, teams of people.\n\nSo, this particular event was fighting a giant ~100m marionette suspended from an airship. To defeat her there were 5 platforms around her that were entered one by one by any number of players each, 10-20, for a total of ~50-100 people. Each platform had a different type of mob boss that required different tactics to defeat (i.e. avoid mines, can only hit them from behind, etc). All the while the marionette is also executing different attacks on each platform (stomping, slashing with giant knives, firing a beam). In addition, once your team was kicked from the platform you were on, you suffered a debuf that made you unable to enter another platform for 5 mins so you couldn't run around to each platform.\n\nBasically, it required a lot of team work form a lot of people. I spend hours trying to defeat the marionette unsuccessfully, because if even one team failed, the stages were reset, and you only had so many tries (on a timer) before she killed everyone. There was a lot of failures, alot of rage quits and swearing.\n\nAfter many failed attempts and learning tactics for each platform I got to one of these events early. Started talking with about the dozen or so people there who were waiting, and we decided to take charge, with about 2 people per platform . When new players would arrive at a platform entrance waiting for the event to start, we would actively ask them if they knew what to do, and explained the strategy, just in case someone wasn't aware what was going on. Sure, some people didn't listen or laughed at us for taking it too seriously, but all it takes is like a couple of paragraphs to cover the basics.\n\nIn probably the most intense 15 minutes of my gaming, we rushed on each platform and executed the plans perfectly, only failing once on one platform. It was a near perfect win, and it was the first time I got to defeat the bloody marionette. Helluva fun and rewarding standing around in the victory area and talking with everyone. The first and only time I've ever been part of a 100+ person even in any game that was so challenging and rewarding.\n\n____\n\n/u/iamnotoriginal - [post link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2p2jhr/best_random_teamwork_moment_in_your_multiplayer/cmsw398)\n\nI drove around GTA V in a semi-truck honking and asking people to join my convoy.

It's not necessarily funny but it was the greatest fun I'd had online to date. Me and my cousin were wandering online in Free-Roam, with a lot of other random players. I can't remember our initial plan for what to do, but we were in Mexico, near one of the abandoned forts in the hills (not the huge one with cannons, the one that was derelict on a single path in) when two guys showed up on the map with a bounty on their heads. Me and my cousin decided to sneak up the path to the abandoned fort, and we sniped them from a distance (they didn't realise we were there, musta been on hardcore), then we ran in and claimed the fort for ourselves. At this point a vicious 2v2 battle started for the fort. They called reinforcements though; other random players were joining their posse and spawning nearby. I quickly invited every other player in the game, and many decided to join my posse instead, backing us up as we held the fort. When you died, you'd spawn at the base of the hill path and have to run up, so those attacking the fort would have the dead defenders come up behind them. Over the mic-chat I could hear them shouting that I was behind them, murdering them, and that I was the leader and stuff. To make it even better, another posse joined the battle, making it a full scale 3-way war. Every single player in the session was involved in this tiny patch of land, fighting over a fort - and no one even knew why. Just because me and my cousin wanted to get a bounty off another player hidden there. It was beautiful.\n\n",

        "text": "This is a continuation of the Belin series, as I'm now calling it. \n\nPart 1:http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ti2rf/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_kinslayer/\n\nPart 2:http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2tpbkw/dd_355e_mix_the_tail_of_belin_the_brawler/\n\nLast we left our hero he was feeding the people of our starting village. After a while of doing the hero of the people bit he's ready to get back out and adventure more. However before leaving he decides to teach the people to defend themself and learns to make armor and weapons to give the farmers and such of this village. I'll admit they were terribly crude weapons and not well made armor but he was learning. He spent a while here teaching them so he wouldn't feel bad for leaving. The cleric spent the time at her small temple of pelor (that she built with the help of the paladin.) The monk just trained the whole time. \n\nNow we were ready to head back out in search of adventure. Somehow, against my will, I'd become the leader or something similar at this time. As we gathered our gear, rations, and said our good byes a man showed up. A fighter in spiked armor showed up. (This was Elric's player's new character. He cheated to make this one but no one knew. This became the reason DM had to check sheets first.) \n\nNow for an important piece of info. The player had asked the DM about dual wielding shields. Thinking that he meant wooden shields or bucklers the DM said yea. The DM thought the idea was cool, kinda like a super captain america or something. Little did we know there were ulterior motives here. Now back to our heroes. \n\nSo the new guy showed up in search of Elric. Apparently the same lord sent him. The part had no idea who Elric was (He died before anyone but me met him and I didn't learn his name.) So he describes him. Then the cleric blurts out \"That sounds just like the guy you killed in the kobold house\" Damn... So of course he challenges Belin to a fight to the death. (Turns out Elric's player was still mad about his character dying and made this one specifically to kill me.)\nBelin never backs down from a challenge and accepts. As I get my sword out and get ready the fighter pulls out a necklace and says a prayer to Kord. Belin asks who Kord is and the fighter says \"I'm not surprised you don't know him. He only favors the strong.\" Then he talks some smack about how I must have gotten the jump on Elric cause he was stronger than me. Anyway Initiative time. I go first. I go to hit him with my greatsword. I roll and 16 before my bonuses. Awesome I've hit him... or so I think. He says I miss. This is where the DM says \"Good lord what is your AC?\" He say's it's 21. Turns out he bought spiked plate armor and 2 spiked heavy steel sheilds. DM realizes that he shouldn't have that much money to buy everything and that he cheated out this character. DM goes to call off fight but I say keep it going. Anyway so the fighter hits Belin pretty hard and this time Belin hits back. We trade a few blows and I'm forced to use my rage. Finally I'm at 2hp and he's doing a little better than that. He tells me that if I surrender and admit he's stronger and should be our leader, that he'll spare me. Now by this point even you should know that's not about to happen. Belin say's \"Hey Kord watch this!\" Then I rolled a crit. Everyone's jaw dropped. Not gonna lie... mine did too. I killed him right then and there. Our DM looked at me and goes \"Kord has now taken notice of you. Continue to please him and things could get very interesting.\" Belin ripped the Kord necklace off and put it on.\n\nElric's player was pulled aside and scolded harshly. We all discussed and decided to let him continue to play with us on a legit character. He decided that fighting me wasn't working so his new character's goal would be to befriend me. \n\nA halfling that was in the crowd decided he wanted to join us because he knew a strong orc would make a good ally on his journey. (Elric's player's 3rd character) So now we were once again 5. We hear stories of a nearby cave that is rumored to have treasure in it. The party convinces Belin that we should get it to bankroll our travels. Off we go to the cave. We get to the cave and the entrance is blocked off by a rockslide. As we are walking away from the entrance trying to find another way in our monk finds a crack in the wall. I entered first and they followed. This path ended up leading to the nest of giant ants. After a bloody fight there were ant corpses everywhere. Finally the path came out into a bigger room with a huge lake in the middle. There was a crack in the top of the cave and we could see something sparkling at the bottom of the lake. Of course people start jumping in to dive and get it. Dumb as hell idea. What's also in the lake you ask? A Aboleth. After a gruesome fight we finally kill it. However myself and our paladin are now membrane jellyfish type things that have to stay in the water. Belin and him swim to the bottom and bring out all the treasure for the party. This is where the DM took pitty on us. He said the lake opened up into a river that we were able to swim up back towards a larger village. The party walked next to the river carrying the loot. When we got to the new village we were able to pay a priest to smack us both with remove disease. Now we are in a larger village with loot (less now that we paid the priest.) We hit up the taven looking for lodging and leads on more adventures. Belin buys a greataxe in the town. Now he's got a greatsword on his back going right shoulder to left side and a greataxe going left shoulder to right side.\n\nEnd of day 3. One more PC killed. Belin's ally total kills is at 3 now. More to come.",

        "text": "This is a continuation to http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ti2rf/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_kinslayer/\n\nSo last we left off a house of Kobolds just felt Belin's wrath. It's at this time the party (or what's left of it) decides to refortify the house and stay the night in it. The remaining members are worried that we've messed up by placing ourselves in the war. Belin simply say's \"If a side wins then the war is over.\" The next day we all wake up and decide to go talk to the goblins with a new plan. We're gonna offer our help to win the war, as long as they agree to leave the town alone. As we exit the house we are met by a tiefling paladin (Half Orc Sorcerer's player) who sees the carnage and asks about it. We explain the whole story and he decides to join us. Now we are 4 again. (Elric's player couldn't make it to day 2.)\n\nSo we are traveling to the goblin's strong hold and it's so far away we have to rest. We decide to take turns sleeping to guard. While everyone is resting our cleric is the only one awake keeping guard. After a natural 1 a few goblins get the jump on her and knock her out. We all wake up in cages without our weapons or packs. We come face to face with the goblin chief (a barbarian.) They are curious why we are so close to they're stronghold and convinced we were sent by the Kobolds as spies or worse. The party keeps trying to talk their way out of it but the goblins don't care. It's at this point that Belin steps up and challenges the goblin chief to unarmed combat. Even strips off his armor to make up for the size difference. The chief refuses to look bad in front of his men and accepts. During the fight I finally use rage and beat the crap out of him. He gets some good hits but at the end I spare him. I tell him that if I really worked for the Kobolds that I'd kill him but instead I'm willing to put my muscles to work for him. Now all the goblins are calling me \"Belin the Brawler.\" At this point he agrees that our help is needed and lets my party go. He tells us about the Kobold strong hold and where it's located. Turns out it's in a big cave that used to house a dragon. He tells us it's trapped and contains a maze. He tells us that every goblin that's gone hasn't returned. I agree to slaughter them all and we depart after collecting our belongings. \n\nOur journey is pretty much what you'd expect. We get there and in front of the cave is a guard tower made out of logs with two Kobold archers at the top. The party stops in the tree line and is discussing the best way to take out the archers. The cleric says she can use her cross bow and the the paladin say's he has a short bow. Of course getting impatient with all the chatter Belin pulls out his greatsword. At this time our monk says \"oh god... here we go again.\" Belin runs out and hits one of the support logs as hard as he can. I roll and unbelievable I hit a nat 20 again. Belin cuts right thru the log and the tower falls down, killing both Kobolds in the process. Two more kobolds run out of the cave entrance hearing the collapse. They are quickly dealt with and we make our way into the cave. Inside all we see is stairs that go down and a giant gong. We assume that the gong is for warning the others. About that time the monk say's he hears footsteps coming up the stairs. A patrol party. Everyone goes to hide. For some dumb reason I get a terrible idea. Belin tries to hide behind the gong. My luck quickly turned and thanks to a 2, the tip of my sword hits the gong and now there is a small party running up the stairs. As they run into the room looking around I decide to push the gong over on them. Some how I managed to kill all but one and he was pinned. I snapped his neck. Now the DM is telling everyone that they need to step up their game because I've gotten almost every kill of our campaign and that he's tempted to just give me all the xp. \n\nNow we decide to go down to the bottom and kill the kobold leader. We slay everything that gets in our way the whole way down. Even stopping to look in barracks and such for loot. We find an armory of small weapons but I take nothing. We find a few spiders in a closed of section but nothing spectacular. We finally reach the bottom and we find out that the kobolds are being led by a drow. He starts trying to explain why he started the fight and is talking about how uncivilized goblins are and how we should help him wipe them out. He offers us treasure and the goblin stronghold to help him. He explains how having our own base would be good. The party starts to ponder on the idea. Before anyone can even reach a decision Belin yells out \"Belin made a promise. Honor is everything.\" He cuts that drow in half. (Did enough damage to 1 hit him lol) The party is in shock that I did it before they could decide. Out of character I ask them what they expected out of him after all they've seen. \n\nThey take all the loot that he's been having the kobolds get for him. Belin say's that he doesn't want it. He grabs all the grain and such that he can carry to take back to the town. We leave for the goblin camp and inform them what's happened. The chief keeps his word and gains respect for the party for not betraying him. Belin is now a friend to him for some reason. He tells Belin when he gets tired of the party he has a home there. We return to the village and I give out the goods that I've returned and I feed the hungry. Now I'm a hero. The greedy party sells off what little they can but the village is too poor to buy much. \n\nDay 2 ended. No party members dead and one joined. More to come. \n\nEdit: I feel like I should add just a little more background info. I'm the newest and youngest in my group. I'm 23 and have been playing since 2007. However, I've played every edition of D&amp;D, all of Whitewolf's World of Darkness books, Shadowrun, and every edition of Munchkin lol. The rest are in their 30's and 40's and some have been playing longer than I'm alive. I've been the only DM and haven't played since 2009.  That's why I like this game so much. Don't get me wrong I love making up the adventure and seeing my players have fun but sometimes I wanna take a break and play. Sadly no one in my regular group likes to DM and so it's always on me lol. Thankfully this DM is part of my regular group.\n\nAlso this DM let us roll stats. My character is a chaotic good half orc barbarian with a strength of 19 and a int of 9. That plus his back story is why he acts the way he acts. I try to always play my character like they should be. Not me playing them and making choices I would make but making choices they would make. A rough and tough brawler isn't gonna sit and think about stuff, he's gonna act.",

I will hopefully make this a weekly thing, with an updating map drawn by the two players.\n\nAnyway...\n\n*In a wicked age...*\n\nA raving prophet, advocating self-mortification and deprivation of the appetites...\n\nA young girl, inexperienced but astute and a canny judge of character...\n\nA priestess of a merciful temple of healers, on pilgrimage to the birthplace of her order...\n\nA wandering spirit, visible at will, an inflamer of human passions...\n\nIn a wicked age, along a well-traveled road only a few days from the Mouth of the World, at a popular stop for those wandering these unknown places named Patchstones, a young priest of the healing god Bolbe aids those who need it. Pellonia is confronted by her followers, angry that a woman has led them. She hears a whisper in her ear and manages to sooth her companions with her voice. Shaken by what she believes is an encounter with a spirit, she begins with her attempts to convert the populace through kindness after noticing a priest of a rival faith moving about the camp.\n\nMeanwhile Callias, that dour-faced priest of Draxor, is moving through the streets when he senses he's being followed. Before he can react, he is pulled behind a tent, knocked unconscious, and tied up. He wakes up and sees that a young man is guarding him for some reason. Callias stands up and starts to preach guilt and shame at the young man, who eventually tires of having his space invaded, and pushes him away. Callias, unwilling to actually attack this young man, sticks his foot out and trips him. Unfortunately he misjudges it and the guy just jumps over his outstretched limb. He overpowers the priest, who tired of rolling straight 2s long ago, and ties his feet up as well.\n\nEventually a young girl enters, and Callias recognizes her as the daughter of a family he'd once preached to. She tells him that he was responsible for her family's pain after they converted, and she's come to get her vengeance. She draws him to his feet and starts to lead him towards the camp torch boundary, outside of which she intends to murder him. Callias isn't taking it, so he starts loudly preaching about how this woman is needlessly assaulting a religious man.\n\nShamed, the woman and her guard leave as the crowd turns hostile towards her. Meanwhile, a minor trickster spirit known as Shu-Tanabar tries to whip the crowd into a frenzy but fails hilariously as Callias turns the crowd's anger into curiosity about Draxor's message.\n\nArmed with their respective followers, the two priests converge on the center of camp. The rival crowds are already near-violent, and Shu-Tanabar is doing his best to incite them further (but failing terribly). Pellonia is struck with a vision and reveals the spirit's true form to the crowd before banishing it from her sight.\n\nCallias, twisting the interaction to his own means, wins the crowd's devotion and almost sets them against Pellonia before the female priest brings the crowd to their senses by telling them they were being manipulated by a spirit. The tension defused, Callias and Pellonia share warning glances across the square before retiring for the night, relieved that the night hadn't erupted into violence after all...\n\nSo that was our first session. It was a little rocky because the tone wasn't set properly beforehand, and some of the Best Interests were too vague or ill-defined (like \"Prevent the camp from falling to hedonism\" and \"Convert people\"). Over the course of the game there were three additions to the We Owed list, but they were all crossed off, so we'll see where things go next week when we follow up.\n\n**The Players**\n\n**Callias:** A dour-faced priest of Draxor. \n\n**Best Interests:** \"Preventing any falling to hedonism\" and \"Change the minds, convert the priestess retinue to follow Draxor.\"\n\n**Particular Strength:** Incendiary Preacher; Broad (With Love, For Others)\n\n**Pellonia:** Young, pretty priestess of Bolbe, a healer god.\n\n**Best Interests:** \"Successfully reach the end of my pilgrimage\" and ~~\"Honor the mother goddess Bolbe by bringing lambs to the flock\"~~ \"Convert people.\"\n\n**Particular Strength:** Visions, Far-Reaching (Directly)\n\n**Non-Player Characters:**\n\nMara: Young girl, believes she was wronged. Wants to murder Callias and shame Pellonia.\n\nKril: Young man, dragged along by love. Wants to protect Mara and steal holy items.\n\nShu-Tanabar: A wandering spirit of mischief. Wants to increase hedonism, and turn Pellonia's friends against her. Fails literally every single roll, making him the worst spirit ever.\n\n\"The Crowd\": A conglomeration of random passers-by. Fickle and dumb, they existed to be converted by the priests. We ran into some trouble here, as the oracles seemed to imply a lot of talking, which isn't necessarily what the system is for.\n\nOverall I think it went pretty well for our first time with such a weird system.\n\n**[The Map](http://imgur.com/yR8XZWF)**\n\n**We Owed...**\n\n~~Pellonia~~\n\n~~Callias~~\n\n~~Callias~~",

        "text": "OK my group are participating in an athletic competition, which they are doing tremendously in. We have Navii a female rogue Dragonborn with an attitude, Weslin male Half-Elf rogue, Deus the male minotaur fighter, and Seeker an Eladrin ranger. They were staying inside the Silver Unicorn and having a party after the event. Lots of mead was purchased and they had a great night. That morning they had a hearty breakfast and headed out the door to get ready for their event.\n\nAs they headed out they noticed a short human male (Standing at 4'7) in elegant robes dragging a halfling woman by a chain leash. He cuts in front of merchant pulling a donkey along carrying the items he has for sale. The donkey reared and kicked the Halfling in face. The human male, started to yell at the halfing to get up and started dragging her. This is when Seeker runs over and confronts the man and calmly tells him to stop what he's doing. This of course upsets the man who then tells Seeker that the halfling is his slave and what he does to her is his business.\n\nThis upsets Seeker and he throws a punch at the man however Navii steps in and grabs his fist. The man attempts to bribe them to get them to leave him alone What does she do? She straight up uses her breath weapon and shoots lighting out at his feet.  The man jumps back and reveals that he is Hiel Fortun a decedent of a wealthly family who \"Knows many people in many positions of power\" as he puts it.\n\nthe entire group roll intimidate checks and all get high rolls and scar the shit out of him. Hiel throws them a coin purse and is inching away while everyone is yelling at him. In the midst of all this Weslin buys a sack from the merchant with the donkey, vomits inside the bag and ties it up. He tells me he wants to throw it at him, so I tell him to roll for it, gets a 23... \nWeslin yells  out \"Hey We'll trade ya!\" and  hurls the bag at him, Hiel didn't even have enough time to reac andt gets pelted in the chest with the sack which just spills out all the vomit all over his robes. Laughter erupted and we had to stop for like 5 minutes to just ask what the hell he was thinking making Weslin do that\n\n\"I didn't think the bag of vomit would've exploded! I never roll that high, I thought he'd catch it look at it and toss it aside!\"\n\nThis of course majorly pisses Hiel off and he swears that he'll get them, because they have messed with the Fortun family. He turns tail and runs with his slave dragging her along the way... Straight to the guard post. Without hesitation the gang runs back into the Silver Unicorn and asks everyone in the inn to vouch for them and since they've all been good to the residents they all agree to help them out. \n\nHiel comes back to the inn and accuses them of assaulting him and robbing him.  With some amazing diplomacy rolls Navii (with the help of the inn residents) proved that Hiel had no proof and the guards let them off. Hiel even more angry stormed out and went about his business. \n\nOf course it doesn't end there, Navii and Seeker followed him stealthily blending with the crowds until Hiel stopped into a treasury where he had the Halfling slave locked to a hitch. (Like how you wrap a dog leash around a pole). After conversing with her the learned they needed the key to get her collar off, because their lock picking attempts proved fruitless. So Seeker set in to pickpocket Hiel. \n\nThen Navii gets the idea AFTER Seeker is in the building blending in with crowds to just use her other breath weapon (acid) and corrode the chains. She corrodes the chains and takes her to a campsite they have with allies not far from that town. \n\nSeeker with some amazing rolls blends in perfectly and gets right behind Hiel and rushes him from behind tosses his robe over his head, grabs his keys, steals a jeweled cutlass he had and teleported out of the building and walked to the campsite blending in with the crowd again.\n\nTurns out the cutlass belonged to the halfing so he returned it to her, and unlocked the collar from her neck. Of course he collected all the evidence and had Navii destroy the rest with her acid breath. I swear this group never ceases to amaze me \n\n",

        "text": "Our party was just finishing our quest to perform selective immolation of bridges along the border provinces (it’s a long story), when we were attacked by a trio of huge orc warriors wielding odd bows. They managed to shoot two of our three horses out from under us in a single round (we ate well that night), so the Ranger and the Wizard decided to take up defensive positions behind their equestrian corpses. Meanwhile, the Paladin decided it would be a great idea to charge all three gigantic orcs on the last surviving horse. Needless to say, he ended up pinned in the dirt. \n\n\tThankfully, the Ranger and Wizard managed to provide some decent covering fire (literally, in the latter’s case), and the Paladin avoided being skewered. This was also the first session our wizard got to try out his new Flaming Sphere spell, and he took great pleasure in sending it careening into the orcs over and over again.\n\n\tThings were still touch and go when the Ranger rolled a critical failure with his longbow. We wish it had ended there, but unfortunately, our group has a homebrew confirmation mechanic. And he rolled another one. The DM ruled that his longbow had cleanly snapped in two.\n\n\tThere was a general sense of terror in the group at losing a third of our damage output, especially since one of the orcs had managed to disengage from the Paladin and was now looking at the squishy ranged fighters with an air of considerable malice. But then the wizard, without missing a beat, said “ugh. Here, borrow mine.”\n\tThe wizard had been holding onto a crossbow since level one (old habits die hard). In retrospect, that was probably the only reason we all got out alive. With the ranger properly chastened on the merits of forward thinking, the party went on to do what parties do: loot. It was at this point that things really started to go downhill.\n\n\tWe found two things on the orcs: a journal and several gold medallions. A good knowledge check and a lucky language proficiency later, we discovered that these wayward bandits were actually the personal escort of the heir to the closest thing the orc tribes had to a king, off doing the orc equivalent of adventuring (read: pillaging). The heir whom we had just brutally murdered. To put it into perspective, this was rather like discovering that one has just killed Genghis the Impaling Hun’s favorite goldfish. So naturally, the wizard decided to do the sensible thing, and burn everything.\n\n\tTheir bodies were incinerated, their journal destroyed, their bones buried, their horses stolen, and their medallions hammered into unrecognizability and sold to a certain C.M.O.T. Dibbler, a trader who understands such… sensitive matters. We ran like the cowards we were, back to the king who had originally requested the aforementioned bout of bridge destruction, and swore never to speak of what transpired that day. We pray that nobody else does, either.   \t  \n",

        "text": "Yesterday, some of my friends and I played Rogue Trader for the first time. While out in space searching for treasure, our party came across a small ship calling for aid. Upon arriving, we were ambushed by two pirate ships.\n\nOne of the ships fired at us and did some damage, though we decided to go after them. For the most part, combat was pretty dull. They fired, we fired, few hits were taken on both sides. The most interesting thing to happen is that we manage to land a critical hit on one of the ships and disable its thrusters, making it unable to turn. It drives off into space and manages to escape for us.\n\nHowever, the interesting part comes shortly afterwards. We manage to land a critical hit on it, ripping the side of the other pirate ship up. As the ship heads off into space, we give chase and fire on it again, eventually landing *another* critical hit on it and causing the already damaged ship to catch on fire. As massive fires burn the ship, we keep firing, and all of a sudden, I roll a natural 1. In this case, it was the best possible roll.\n\nI get a whole bunch of bonus rolls and we manage to do enough damage for the ship to be destroyed, but since we did so much damage, we get another critical hit, this time causing the ship to explode with such force that asteroids are thrown all over the place, though thankfully our own ship manages to not get hit. An epic ending for our first session. Maybe not as epic as other tales, but I still considered it worth sharing.\n\n**TL;DR: Spaceship survives having its side ripped open and massive fires before finally going down in a blaze of glory.**",

        "text": "I and my friends have been working on our own tabletop system for a few years, and this is the result of a session we'd just had last night.\n\nI'd made a character for our already running party- a large, aquatic, bipedal rat that was extremely proficient in stealing things and nothing else. He had a name, but he abandoned it when his lifelong friend, Captain SkyWhale, left him for a prince.\nOur party was given an important task: gather some sand from the lair of a Moldoros (frog-dragon thing) and bring it back to the artificer so that he could build us amazing things.\nSo we found its lair.\nI, the thief, snuck into the underwater lair to grab the sand without disturbing the beast. Unfortunately, the resident paladin decided to piss it off.\nClinging to the wall, I hid as the frog dragon flew past me and into the paladin. I quickly made my way into the lair and started shoveling golden sand into my pouch. Amongst the treasure I'd found, there was a longsword. Knowing full well that I had nothing else to attack with, I grabbed it and swam as hard as I could to the surface. Turns out, I could swim at 14 meters per five seconds (so roughly nine feet per second), and rocketed out of the cave in an attempt to deal what little damage I could to the beast.\nWhat followed was hilarious.\n\nI need to interrupt the story to explain how attacks are rolled in our system. Don't worry, it's short.\nBasically, you roll three ten-sided dice and add your modifier to the final score. If you roll two or more tens, you add one to the damage modifier for every ten. You then roll again to see if you crit again, adding any more sets of ten to the mix. Keep going till you stop rolling tens.\n\nI came up from behind the beast, initiating a sneak attack (which, due to my high dexterity, gave me a x6 modifier). I then proceeded to crit with four tens, giving me a x4 modifier on top of that. Then the beast fumbled on its defense, doubling damage again.\nSo this dinky little sword I found underwater used to do 1d10 + 10 damage. Max 20.\nNow it was 1d10 + 10, times 48.\nI dealt 624 damage to the dragon-frog.\nTurns out I left it with 14 HP, but the shock of the blow paralyzed him while the paladin performed a coup de grace.\n\nSo yeah.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to run the statistics of rolling 3d10 twice and getting two tens each time, then rolling 3d10 and rolling two ones, I would appreciate seeing how lucky I got.",

        "text": "Hey there guys! I really loved this campaign and really wanted to share it for others to enjoy. It was full of craziness, shenanigans, and death lol. So here is a little background info. I started out as a player in love with the game but lately can't seem to find another DM so I'm always the DM. Here is the story of me finally playing for a change as Belin. \n\nOur group is now made up of the following\n\n\"Our hero\" Belin the Half-Orc Barbarian\nBelin grew up like many half-orcs do in a orc village. He was tormented and tortured by the orcs that looked at him as lesser. He had to fight everyday to keep them off of him and eventually became fierce and dangerous himself. He grew to a larger and intimidating size. Even growing up in a place like this he still had good in his heart and knew there had to be a better life out there for him. He left to the town in search of a purpose. \n\nKanter the half-orc sorcerer\nA completely off the wall creation by a friend and to be honest I don't know his back story. I know he was raised by humans instead of orcs and that's seriously it. Either he didn't make one or didn't share it. I'll get to why I don't know much about this one. \n\nCamillion the half-elf cleric of Pelor\nThis one loves Belin to death for all the help he's given her and all the hits he's taken in her place. Her goal is to spread the word of Pelor and restore his fallen temples. She's a funny one with no strength. More on that later. \n\nRando the elf monk\nThis one was constantly was out to prove himself. He was quiet almost always until it was time for a plan. He would suggest one and then be mad if no one listened. Did good damage and was decent in a pinch. \n\nElric the elf ranged ranger\nHe was sent by a lord to investigate the war and put an end to it. Not much was known about him. \n\nOur story starts out in a typical small village. Sadly I can't remember the name for the life of me. It was like Bogdon or something. Regardless, the village has a pub, a small market place, and a Inn. That's pretty much it. Small right? Anyway there just happens to be several small farms and such around. When a war breaks out between goblins and kobolds it starts to have a negative impact on everyone. Farms are getting ransacked, people are being run out of their homes, and all trade is being blocked off. \n\nHere is where the mayor gathers all the locals and tries to put together some kind of group to talk to the sides and see what can be done. Of course our adventurers are a part of this group. We all bravely step up to defend the town. At this point our group is almost completely formed (we were missing Elric but he didn't want to be from the village so he came in later.)\n\nSo naturally we group up and discuss the best plan. My character didn't talk much, ever. He was an actions kinda guy. They asked what Belin thought. Belin simply shrugged and said \"Goblins closer\" No we start making our way to the goblins. On our way we came across a two story house that had all the windows boarded up and kobolds were firing arrows out of small cracks. They were shooting at anything that went by. Our group tried to decided the best course of action. At this time Belin saw them shooting at innocents. I asked our DM what do I see around? He said there were several barricades made by them that were small logs strung together in a crisscross pattern. Making an x. He said they were about 4 foot tall do to how little kobolds are. Here is where things got interesting. \n\nI look at the group and they are still talking. Time for fun I think. I roll a strength check to pick up the barricade and throw it thru a window on the first floor that had two arrows sticking out of it. Natural 20. Our DM was in shock as I threw it right thru the window and actually killed both of them. I then charged into the house and killed one when I got inside. The entire party was confused and rushed after me thinking they needed to save me. We all roll initiative. Lucky me, I go first. I then kill the last kobold on the first floor. Our cleric and sorcerer try to shoot thru the windows upstairs with crossbows and both miss. The monk tries to get inside but falls just short of the entrance. Person who goes last is Elric the ranger. He decides to come in thru the back door. He figures this will be his first party interaction and wants to make an impression on me. He trains his bow on me and tells me to drop my weapon. Now it's my turn. My DM asks what I'm gonna do. I do my best not to meta so I tell him \"all I know is that I saw arrows being shot out of windows. I'm killing everything with a bow.\" I go to hit him and who would guess... I crit and when I roll damage on my great sword I roll max damage. Well he's dead on the ground now. At this point all of my party members are dying with laughter. \n\nNext set of turns the Sorcerer takes a ton of arrows and is down. Well I kill everything else in the house. I posted up in the stairs and made them come to me. Made the monk mad cause he couldn't get past my huge body tho lol. I come outside and Sorcerer say's he wants a good death and asks me as a fellow half orc to do the deed (player realized Half-Orc Sorcerer might not be a good idea and wants to reroll). Without thinking Belin snaps his neck. Thus they deemed him the Kinslayer. \n\nEnd of Day 1 and already two PC deaths. I'll add some more of the story later in a new post after I get off work. ",

        "text": "[A brief tale from my campaign!](http://redd.it/2t3u1o)\n\nThe party in my campaign is employed by a group called \"Asshole patrol\", which despite the cringeworthy name, has proven to be an organization made up of really capable individuals. The party is their newest team, but they had several others, as well as some support staff. Throughout their various down-times, the party got acquainted with some of the other teams.\n\nFirst up was the guy that got them into the mess in the first place, a cyclops ranger who weilded a mace so large that it doubled as a minivan. He didn't talk much, but he was apparently playing the \"lone ranger\" business to the hilt, much to the annoyance of pretty much anybody who ever met him. He once saved the party from a bugbear paladin by beating it with a mace until the party killstole it with a piddling 2-damage acid flask barrage (which left a rather positive, if confused, impression. I mean, really? You took it down with an *acid flask*?).\n\nNext was the support staff- a tall, quiet, dour man with rivets under his skin called Iv, and a short, surly ball of dwarf hair named Boulderstorm. They were the architects of the place and made sure all of the upgrades got done in a timely manner, and sweet holy bejeezus did they work fast. See, Iv was of the race of Titans, who are spectacularly famous for their godlike craftsmanship. Boulderstorm, on the other hand, was probably a prodigious metal-and-stone worker, but the fact of the matter was that he was being compared to a Titan. Boulderstorm swore a lot, and practically ran on frustration and insecurity.\n\nThere was also an old, defunct team that had been annihilated as part of one player's backstory. They went by the name Unicorn Tamers, and were killed in a tragic unicorn rampage. The only surviving member, Barrel, is understandably paranoid around horses and in general anything with horns.\n\nAnother one-man team took the form of Hurtle, another cyclops. He was a bit odd, because his base speed was through several similar but distinct roofs. He never stopped moving, ran in excess of 40mph, and specialized in doing hit-and-run assasinations. Or, more appropriately, hit-on-run. The party only knows him in passing, because he never freaking holds still.\n\nFinally, there's a second four-man group who were away on a mission for an absurd amount of time. Called \"Scout Armada\", the group is loosely led by a brackish nautical-themed shapeshifter with a cruel sense of humor. Other members include a Fey Corgi paladin obsessed with armor, a half-elf barbarian who tended to have 'episodes', and an upright british man who refuses to wear a shirt. A mottley bunch, they're just as- if not more- dysfunctional than the party (They're acting as reserve characters and emergency backup).\n\nThis merry bunch is all led by the mission coordinator, a naga bard named Valera who speaks in a prim british accent and has terrible organizational skills. She's learning, though, and she seems to be doing a reasonably good job with the tools at hand, and the party seems to have taken a shine to her- despite the fact that she's clearly hiding *something* in her trapdoor basement.",

The group knew that the kobolds were expecting trouble so the Drow Rogue stealths in farther to the cavern and the rest wait at the entrance but still within range of the main room.\n\nThe rogue discovers that all the pillars are rigged to collapse in case of attack so he stealths over to disable the trap.

After killing the kobolds they move to the door and here mysterious scratching noises approaching the door, then the doors open in front of them and a White Dragon Wyrmling walks through the door. The PCs have no idea if they could defeat this foe so decide to hide behind the dead bodies of the kobolds and pretend to be them, their bluff failed horribly and they ended up signing a contract and agreeing to work for the dragon to pillage the dwarven stronghold they are in. The Dragon sends them into a room with some Kobolds to hunt down the elderly and young, the PCs don't like the sound of this and wait for the dragon to leave before killing the Kobolds and leading the elderly and children to safety in the village where they were imprisoned. They reported there findings to the chieftain of the village who sent a group of warriors to help the dwarves, after healing the party decided to return to the Stronghold to help. When they arrive they happen to bump into the dragon who has come to suspect their betrayal and is attempting to flee the stronghold, he launches an attack on the party along with his kobolds, the party of 7 brutally destroys their attackers leaving the dragon unconscious on the floor, this fight also marked the return of the paladin throwing his longsword, critical hit again killing the last kobold. with the Dragon lying on the ground bleeding out they come up with the brilliant idea of trying to lobotomise the dragon to make it their pet, first they removed the skull cap with a critical surgery roll and then have a 20% chance of successfully lobotomising the dragon, they succeed and end up with a pet dragon, that lacks a breath weapon due to their lobotomy attempt, they then attempt to put the skull cap back on and roll a 3, so they failed in that regard, leaving them with a white dragon wyrmling with no skull cap and no breath weapon that will follow draconic and telepathic commands, the party loves their new pet and seems determined to find a blacksmith to build it armour and a skullcap. But first they have to convince the Dwarfs who drove off the other kobold and the dragons siblings to let them stay in their stronghold with their new dragon who killed at least 10 of their dwarves directly. Fingers crossed for high diplomacy rolls.\n\ntl;dr my party lobotomised a white dragon wyrmling in order to make it their pet ",

        "text": "[A brief tale from my campaign!](http://redd.it/2t3u1o)\n\nThe party has dispatched with a deadly dungeon packed with dangers (sorry) and retrieved their rewards: weird-ass magical artifacts!\n\nThese weren't the normal type, no- I had randomly rolled them up from an [artifact name generator](http://www.seventhsanctum.com/generate.php?Genname=magicitem) and just filled in what I thought was appropriate. Their treasures were a gauntlet, an amulet, a rope, a sack, a bit of armor, and a scythe.\n\nFishnaut, the party sorcerer, immediately used his magic detection skills to scrutinize the loot and get a general idea of what it all did. He was rolling with Knowledge: Arcana, though, so he couldn't get a handle on the exact spells, only the general nature of them. He concluded that the gauntlet was packing some really hostile and violent magic, the scythe had a fire enchantment, the sack had some conjuration magic on it, the armor was pretty obviously ethereal, the rope had a faint transmutation-ish aura, and the amulet was... magnetic?\n\nRose (who was a dullahan, and entirely made of metal) immediately decided that the amulet should stay the HELL away from her, as she had some bad experiences with magnets about five minutes ago (heh heh). She did want that bitchin' scythe, though- so what if she couldn't actually use it?\n\nNobody wanted to try on the gauntlet (damn!). Fishnaut immediately claimed the armor, as it boosted his will save without giving him any armor check penalty or spell failure chance. Nobody was sure what to make of the rope, and everyone was tense about opening the mystery bag. It had to be done, though- adventurers were brave! They did things that nobody else did!\n\nSo, carefully aiming it away from their faces, averting their eyes and raising their weapons, they carefully pulled the drawstring, to reveal...\n\nA wolf.\n\nA wolf giving them the cutest puppy dog eyes of all time, whining and struggling around the bag.\n\nThe party immediately decided that the wold should be released, and the wolf bounded off into the sunset, prancing with joy.\n\nWhat else was in the bag? Nothing! In fact, as far as they could tell, it was a completely ordinary bag. Despite the fact that it held a wolf that was clearly far too large to fit inside of it. Hm.\n\nLater, after they had all gone to sleep, the sack became suddenly heavier. The party once again opened it to find... the same damn wolf.\n\nThey also later discovered that the bag functioned much the same as a bag of holding, but only while the wolf was inside of it. They decided that despite its oddities, this bag was freaking AWESOME and they immediately gave it the nickname of \"The Infinite Wolf Bag\", and set about thinking how they could exploit it, as adventurers are wont to do.\n\nThat wasn't all, though- those were just the artifacts on DISPLAY. There was still the rest of the trap-filled dungeon to sift through! And while others might see a horrible grisly death, the party saw loot waiting to be liberated!\n\nWhere? In the traps!\n\nThey set about dismantling everything they could get their hands on- sawblades, gallon-jugs of alchemist's fire, blade-pendulums, even a mysterious balloon-orb that made the surrounding air unbreathable, they grabbed it all and made a beeline to the nearest town-o'-mad-inventors. They managed to sell their junk for an excess of 2000 gp, all considered. Good times.",

        "text": "So, I'm a new DM, running the prebuilt campaign from the 5e starter set (Lost Mine of Phandelver). The party had cleared out the rest of the goblin's hideout, and only had to face Klarg the Bugbear himself. Previously, the wizard had tamed the three wolves in the first area, and they now fought alongside the party. The rogue hid in the shadows while the non-stealthy characters (the cleric, the two fighters, the wizard, the wolves, and Sildar the NPC fighter) walked in the front entrance. However, they don't attack just yet.\n\nThe Wizard decided to cast Sleep on the two pet wolves. He rolled just high enough to put one to sleep. Klarg, despite being an absolute idiot, somehow managed to figure out that this sleep was unnatural, and knew that he was under attack. At this point, the Wizart decided to try to hit Klarg with Guiding Bolt before the party engaged fully. This would then allow the Rogue to do extra damage with his subsequent sneak attack. However, the wizard rolled a Natural 1. \n\nNow, I tend to be a benevolent Lord and Master of the D&amp;D Universe. In a previous campaign, I had played a DMPC cleric. I decided that this cleric was such a sanctimonious, self-righteous asshole, that everything in the world wanted to attack him, unless another party member was an easier target. That said, for the sake of entertainment, I briefly considered having the Guiding Bolt hit the Rogue hidden in the shadows. However, the prebuilt Rogue has next to no HP. Guiding Bolt does an inordinate amount of damage. It would probably have instantly killed the rogue. Moreover, even if the rogue somehow managed to survive, Klarg would be alerted to his presence, and go step on him. So, I decided to be nice. The Guiding Bolt hit the sleeping wolf instead, instantly killing the least-threatening enemy in the room.\n\nThe Rogue was really looking forward to his sneak attack on Klarg. After much deliberation and planning, he decided that he would try to disarm Klarg. I suppose I described the morningstar a little too vividly... However, he rolled the lowest of the party on initiative. So, OOC the player was literally fidgeting slightly, eager to finally get to disarm this bugbear. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be.\n\nOne of the tamed wolves charged forward and attacked Klarg's one remaining wolf. Klarg, failing an intelligence check,decided to ignore this opportunity and charged at the party instead. He struck, and the party struck back. The Wizard cast Ray of Frost at Klarg, and rolled a Nat 20. I decided that this meant that the spell hit Klarg in the left shoulder, so he could no longer raise his shield. Thus, his Armor Class was reduced by 2.\n\nThe wolf battle was raging a few feet behind Klarg. The wizard decided to help out his pet, and cast Ray of Frost at Klarg's wolf. He dealt more than enough damage to kill it. As one player remarked, \"One wolf got incinerated, and the other got frozen to death.\" \n\nThen, the second of the wolves attacked Klarg, and rolled a Nat 20. I decided that this resulted in the wolf grabbing Klarg by the ankle and tripping him. He fell. Forward. I made the party roll dexterity checks to get out of the way of the falling Bugbear. Everyone but Sildar managed to move out of the way in time. \n\nKlarg literally lay at the party's feet. One of the Fighters swung his battleaxe down into Klarg's head, cleaving his skull cleanly in twain. The Rogue hadn't even had a turn yet. We saw him standing right behind Klarg's body, looking ready and extremely disappointed.\n\nThe Cleric asked to eat Klarg's flesh. He rolled a survival check, and failed. So, he found out that Bugbear flesh tastes like crap. At this point, however, he remembered that one of the possible effects for the Wizard's Prestidigitation cantrip is to change the color, texture, or taste of up to 1 cubic foot of matter. So, he decided to attempt to make the Bugbear flesh edible. And he rolled a Nat 20.\n\n\"The Cleric butchers the bugbear body, harvesting meat until he has 1 cubic foot of it. As the Wizard's magic takes hold, the meat begins to change. It becomes the most tender, succulent, juicy, and perfectly-seasoned Filet Mignon Steak.\" The Cleric cooked it up, and the party feasted, borrowing some mead from one of the barrels of looted provisions in the back of the room.",

        "text": "My D&amp;D group and I are playing a homebrew campaign set in a 1920's low fantasy world. My previous character recently died due to boss fight incompatibilities despite badassery (another story,) so I rolled a tank for the party. And when I mean tank, I *mean* a tank. Working off of the Clockwork Knight custom class, I make a walking suit of armor who can shrug off anything, like [this.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YW8w6qyeNj8/U3GRKv3LIxI/AAAAAAAAHxE/I6aWB9TqCQs/s1600/a0014916_12053198.jpg) He's a suit of armor that acts like an infantry tank. Specifically designed for WWI style trench warfare. A lot of affix bayonet and charge jokes in there. That's a little background for ya, now onto the story.\n\nOh, what's his name? Krieg. \n\nSo we're in Abbysai (the homebrew's not-India-Arabia-Himalayan Countries expy), fresh out of an annoying as hell gauntlet dungeon, when we get attacked by the Emperor's army. Our warpriest (Krieg's brother, played by my brother) casts blessing of flight on us, so we plan fly over them. They fire off a volley of arrows before we do, most of us trying to make reflex saves to dodge. Krieg just stands there, silently, as they plink off his armor. After the blessing is cast, the party flies up, Krieg carrying three party members in his arms (we try to conserve blessings,) and we head anywhere that isn't surrounded by angry soldiers sent to kill us. Luckily that just so happens to be a huge forest we can fly over to avoid them. As we fly over, our DM informs us that we begin to feel very heavy, and that we are falling. We crash into the forest: luckily, the trees are surprisingly soft and cushy, and we only take minimal damage, which is to say none for Krieg. Krieg gets out of the crater he made and begins digging a trench around the squirming bodies of his friends.\n\nWhen everyone else gets up, we begin to look for a way out. While the others stand around and argue, I roll a d8, pick a cardinal direction (east), and charge into the forest. Krieg sees a skunk urinating on something shiny and decides to charge it. The others hear a large bang and investigate.\n\nThe clearing is covered in blood, and so is Krieg. He stares silently at the others, smelling slightly of skunk. As they investigate the shiny piece on the ground, which turns out to be a finely carved stone ear, Krieg goes to the nearby stream he heard to wash off. Upon stepping out into the water, he looks across to see a strange man fishing on the opposite side, mouth agape. Krieg and the fisherman stare at each other in silence for some time. Eventually the man makes a sandwich and hands it to Krieg. Krieg takes it and looks at the man, his visor a impenetrable metal expression. The man moves his hand towards his mouth, mimicking eating. Krieg smushes the sandwich up against his visor. This is when the others come out to the stream.\n\nThat's the story of the Robot and the Fisherman. There's more I can share if you want, about Krieg or my other character, a Cajun half-elf bootlegger.",

        "text": "\n\nHi, it’s Boris_of_Latvia with OP’s delivery service! Thirty minutes or less, or it’s free!\n\n I heard that some of you guys wanted more from my particular group of Russian ~~murderhoboes~~ mobsters and their two ~~civilian pets~~  hostages, so here I am.\n\nOh, and have some pixel art while you’re at it. Will edit this post later to add even more of these. imgur.com/a/It2FK\n\nWhen we last left off, our group of intrepid heroes was… duct taped into their van by a fat man and his squadron of polo-shirt wearing goons. In their possession is the following:\n\nOne (1) Winchester rifle and assorted ammunition\n\nOne (1) 1975 Makarov pistol and assorted ammunition\n\nOne (1) composite bow and arrows (broken)\n\nThree (3) cell phones\n\nOne (1) Afroed head of a zombie prostitute (de-jawed)\n\nOne (1) gold tooth from said zombie prostitute\n\nOne (1) stained meat cleaver\n\nOne (1) set of lockpicks\n\nOne (1) grappling hook\n\nThree (3) survival knives\n\nand\n\nOne (1) book of initiation for a local secret society.\n\n(There were probably other things but I don’t have the character sheets to look at)\n\nThe group was huddled in two different corners of the van (one for David and Carol, the other for everyone else pointing their weapons at them) and felt a jolt as their van was attached to another car. They drove for what seemed like an hour, and suddenly stopped. \n\nA knock came at the door. “Who is it?” asked Steve snarkily. The portly man in the polo shirt tore the duct tape off of the driver’s side window, revealing a large, modernist house in a walled compound. He made a show of choosing who he wanted to come with him first, and sprayed air freshener into burlap sacks to put over the party’s heads…\n\nI was totally expecting the party to turn this into a combat encounter, but they actually were very well behaved.\n\nAll five members of the party had similar experiences: They were all ushered into a spare-looking room with a painting, two potted bonsai, and a young woman with a foreign accent who introduced herself as Dominica. They were asked three questions: Who they got the car from, whether they had come to collect on her debts and who they were working for.\n\nIt was Steve’s turn first, then Ivan's. Both of them answered her questions the same way: I don’t remember, no, and wouldn’t you like to know.\n\nCarol’s turn came next, and she spilled everything: that the group was with some sort of criminal organization, that there were weird things in the woods, and that she and David were in danger. Dominica was visibly relieved at this, but told him to sit tight, not panic, and stay in the area.\n\nWhen it was Gerry’s turn to be interrogated, I asked him to roll notice. He was the only one of the group to realize that the painting on the wall was a Manet, and one of his rarer early works at that. If he were only here in a different capacity, he could make an easy several million off of it, seeing as it didn’t seem to have any alarm system (he didn’t roll very high on the notice roll).\n\nDavid came last. He rolled notice on her accent, revealing her to be a native of Peru. He also tried his best to convince this woman that he wasn’t really in this group, that he was in danger. The two hit it off during the “interrogation”, talking about bonsai, Evo Morales, and fishing. He even got to leave without the bag on his head, after being warned, again, to stay out of trouble and keep calm.\n\nThe group was put back into the sweaty van for a while. They came up with a number of escape plans, most of which included dozens of casualties, far more guns than were available, and varying degrees of “a blaze of glory”. Then, Fat Polo knocked on the door, holding up the lavender-scented bags again.\nThe group came to their senses in a room full of various sensory equipment. Wall-mounted monitors showed all of the various rooms of the (evidently massive) house and surrounding property. However, the NPCs were all clustered around a drably painted wooden box with a slit in it. Lying next to was a cheap camcorder, connected to one of the monitors. Ms. Dominica motioned to one of the guards to rewind the tape to approximately 9 pm.\n\nA bearded man in a baseball cap appeared on screen. Behind him, the woods were darkening.\n \n“Tonight’s the night. Day number fourteen. I’m spreading out the cameras a little bit more today, figure that I might be able to work the land, catch a glimpse tonight. Hope that we got a glimpse tonight.” The man picks up a bag from the ground and goes offscreen. The rumbling of a motor is heard in the distance.\n\nDominica turned around and paused the video. “That was Adam Hoefler. He’s an employee at the cranberry farm to the south of here, repairing the mechanized harvesters and sorting machines. He’s been missing from work and from his house for about two weeks.” She jerked her thumb at the camcorder. “We found this on  the outskirts of my property—apparently, he’s been looking for something or other for the past two weeks.” She then motioned for the video to fast forward.\n\nThe next time the video stopped was when a strange, black-robed figure appeared on screen, followed by a number of others.\n\n“I remember these guys. They’re part of… some group or another.” Said Gerry. \n\n“Compact of Lords.” Dominica nodded. “They’re a local social society. They’ve had a big influx of new members ever since they allowed women into the organization. I talked to the members of the local lodge, they already agreed to hold their initiation ceremonies elsewhere.”\n\n“Initiation ceremony?”\n\n“Just watch.”\n\nThe group of black-robed men and women formed a circle around a teenager. A middle-aged woman stepped forward with a plastic torso—a CPR dummy. The teenager was very excited, fumbling over his Swedish. When he reaches the final word of the chant, the middle-aged woman makes a motion under her cloak. And….\n\nThe teenager falls over in fright as the chest of the CPR dummy explodes into fireworks.\n\n“See? They’re harmless. I only stopped to show you some contrast.”\n\nThe video fast forwards past a bear ambling by, a couple of deer in the background, and a hiker.\n Dominica orders the guard to stop around midnight.\n\n“I know it’s only here for a couple of frames at a time, so you’re going to have to look closely. These next few minutes are the reason I brought you up here.”  The party leaned in close to see the shape she outlined. A figure, maybe two, walks deliberately across the very far edge of the camera’s vision. Strange noises come out of the speaker, which I described as a mix of the grinding of gears and a live Sunn O))) concert. Several minutes later, something knocks the camera off of its perch and cuts the sound.\n\nThen…\n\nFeet. Hundreds of them. The legs of several dozen people shuffle, lurching forwards across the camera’s tilted view. Their skin looks diseased even in the monochromatic pallor of night vision. \n\n“This goes on for about thirty minutes.” Says Dominica. “They all mill around in this area and then wander off early in the morning. To think that they might still be in the area is… troubling, to say the least.” She unplugs the camcorder from the socket and the television flickers and turns off. She turned to Carol. “When you told me that you had fought and beaten these… things… I knew that you folks could help. Anything you know about them would help.”\n\nIvan stepped forward. “You have known the George Romero? The Dawn of Living Dead and such? Is like that.”\n\nSteve nodded. “You have to shoot them in the head—only way to be absolutely sure.”\n\n“Also, bows and arrows are surprisingly ineffective” added Carol.\n\n“Ma’am, we may have a situation.” One of the guards pointed at a monitor on the wall. The image was grainy, but everyone could clearly see that small groups of sickly-looking people have congregated on either side of the compound. A taller man, described as having “well conditioned hair even in un-death”, marched (as much as a zombie could march) confidently in front of his “troops”, grunting and groaning.\nMost of the party began throwing around expletives at this point.\n\n“Here, take these.” Dominica produced a number of cheap pistols from a desk drawer. “I’ll want them back, of course.” She then walked out of the room, coming back with an automatic rifle. “You take the Northern wall. Security will be watching all of the other walls.”\n\n“Lady, how many secret gun-compartments do you even *have*?” asked Gerry.\n\n“More than enough.”\n\n(I got really tired at this point in writing so I’m going to stop doing quotes and dialogue for now)\n\nThe group sets up their gear on a rampart of the compound wall, above the zombies’ reach but not out of climbing height. The zombie forces are shambling slowly towards the wall, led by the one with the well-washed hair.  The group draws relatively badly, and the zombies get within walking distance of the wall within three turns. David takes badly aimed potshots at the closest zombie, and takes him out after three turns. Carol, Ivan and Steve go full out on the main leader, trying to grind down his ability to move fast. Ivan, who succeeded on a notice check, whips around to see Gerry inside the house, with a zombie stuck in a bush attempting to get up and follow him. Ivan dispatches him. Steve and Carol continue to wound the boss until Carol carefully places a nice headshot.  The zombie swoons and falls over, dead again. The remaining zombies stop their march, and begin to disperse. The group continues to take potshots at the fleeing zombies until they hear an alarm from within the compound…\n\nGerry cursed his luck as he lifted the painting off of the wall. Of course there had to be a stupid alarm system! His only chance now was to hijack a car and get out of the woods as fast as he could. He ran, the priceless painting tucked under his arm, right into the pudge and Kevlar of one of the security guards.  They form a circle around him, roughing him up (and giving him a -1 exhaustion malus). The party witnesses this, then walks on by to Mrs. Dominica to arrange their release.\n\nMrs. Dominica Arai thanks them for their help. She then asks them to stay in the state, and to help her and her team find Hoefler (who should be in the local area). In return, she will give the priceless Manet to the group as a down payment, with promise of future payment down the road. The group, realizing how absolutely loaded their new boss is, heartily agrees.\n\nThis is about where it all goes bad.\n\nThe group is in the garage of the complex. Their van is having its wheel clamps removed. The group is milling around when they remember that David attempted to hold them hostage last session by threatening to call the cops on them. David does not roll to resist.\n\nCarol hides in a corner of the garage as the three other party members attempt to, and succeed in, cutting off David’s dominant hand and threatening worse if anything funny happens. The guards, pretending not to notice the rapidly spreading pool of blood on the pristine garage floor, tell the group that their van awaits.\n\nThe group is driving down the road, and I make them draw random encounter. Clubs- an obstacle. I smile the smile all DMs smile when everything goes according to plan. This is a perfect time for me to introduce the party's NPC healer.\n\nThe van makes worrying noises on the road. Gerry, who has been consigned to driving for the time being, pulls over to take a look, since he and Ivan are the only ones with the Repair skill, and Ivan is busy making sure his hostage isn’t bleeding out. Gerry and Steve walk out of the car to take a look at the engine, which is frothy and smells like English cooking. David takes this chance to run out of the van, grabbing Carol with his one remaining hand, and take a sprint to the forest. Steve picks his Winchester off of the hood and is about to take a shot when…\n\nI switch the soundtrack from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Andean panpipe music.\n\nObviously, everyone is mighty confused by this development.\n\nA transparent figure walks casually out of the woods and becomes material. A black man, in black tie, carrying a black leather satchel full of fresh herbs and berries. The group has met local legend James Still, AKA the Ghost of the Black Doctor. \n\nStill casts a healing spell to regrow David’s hand. When Steve protests, Still explains that he can only repair fresh wounds. He then repairs Gerry’s wounds and the van.  Steve asks where Still was during Iraq, to which Still replies “studying”.\n\nI roll persuasion for Still, and it crits. \n\nJames Still makes several complicated motions with his hands, claiming he has “cast a hex” on the players that would “bring all damage done to each other back on them a thousandtimesfold”. David and Carol take this as an opening and run deeper into the woods…\n\nDavid and Carrol find a safe in the middle of the woods. It has been recently opened, but the contents are still inside—a revolver and enough bullets to supply a small army. The two of them walk to the nearest pay phone and call Chojiro Arai, David’s one friend (Pick up anything similar here? The group didn’t!).\n\nGerry, Steve, and Ivan are driving down the interstate to get to Gerry’s apartment in Morristown when they receive a call on David’s phone. It’s from David at the payphone. Soon, it is picked up by Chojiro, who tells the group that they have incurred the wrath of the Yakuza, and hangs up.\n\nThe group gets to the apartment and begins to pore over the Compact of Lords initiation book that none of them know how to read. Ivan helpfully suggests that they try putting it into Google Translate. I tell them that most everything in the book is in Swedish, but is in the form of nonsense, nursery rhymes, pop song lyrics, and machine assembly instructions. Most of the “instructions” are for archaic machines that don’t work that have strange powers, such as “mass suggestion”, “personality implantation” and “electromagnetic manipulation”. The book is old, too, and much of it is in an undecipherable handwriting. \n\nThe session ends with the group getting a knock on their door by two suited people, a tall man and a red-haired woman, asking if they’d seen a certain white-haired chain smoker doing dastardly things or infiltrating the government recently. Ivan shuts the door in their face and orders a pizza.\n",

        "text": "So, for those who don’t know, I’ve been chronicling my groups foray into 5e. [Here’s a link to the previous story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2srgdp/the_wizards_challenge/) Also, sorry about the delay. I had this whole thing typed up on Sunday-ish, but Reddit fumbled the post. Soooooo, I had to re-type the whole thing. 11k Characters gone in a few seconds :(\n\nThe party finished resting overnight and met up at the center of town to resume their search for the exit to floor one, in order to ascend to floor two. Vanir did some poking around in the tavern and discovered that there were rumors of groups of Kobolds and Wild Wolves working together to the east.\n\nFor clarification: Vanir is a Half-Elf Bard, Honner is a Dwarven Cleric, and Lavena is a Tiefling Rogue.\n\n----\nHeading East, the party stumbles across an abandoned campground. Sure enough, Perception and Investigation checks abound, with our Rogue first entering stealth as a precaution. They eventually determine that the campsite is truly abandoned. They investigate the cart beside the campsite and tent and find out that it’s a merchant’s cart. With some shitty tracking checks from Vanir, they find a faint set of tracks and blood splatters. Following the blood, they head down the path and cross the bridge heading further east. \n\nSuddenly, the DM asks for Perception checks. Vanir scores a 19, and detects some splashing downriver (To the north). Vanir and Honner decide to head downriver to investigate. As we finish crossing the bridge, Lavena makes a perception check and detects a scaly limb poking out from the tower to the south-west. She opts to keep this info to herself, so Vanir and Honner continue to head downstream. (The DM would later inform us that the sound of splashing was due to a missed arrow salvo from the tower, but we needed a 20 to detect the actual shot)\n\nVanir is walking along the riverbank when the DM asks for a reflex save. He passes, and deftly jumps back as a Kobold bursts from a hole underneath of him. He takes a quick parting shot and lands a glancing blow on the Kobold. \n\nROLL FOR INITIATIVE. Honner once again rolls terribly, with Lavena and Vanir rolling a solid 17 each. Kobolds beat us though, and combat begins. \n\nThe Kobold in front of Vanir dashes forward and manages to cut him with a dagger, taking him down to half health. The two bowman in the tower take their shots but miss. Lavena rushes forward and throws a flask of oil into the tower. \nVanir takes his turn and downs the kobold in front of him with his rapier, and then moves to cover behind a pillar. Honner takes his turn and then casts his Sacred Flame cantrip. The Kobolds fail their Dex saves and he lights the whole tower on fire. DM awards inspiration for the cross class combo.\n\nWith the foes seeming defeated, we all roll perception checks. Not finding anything, we spread out and check around the area. Lavena checks the burnt tower, with Vanir asking if she will check and see if the poor merchant was stuck in there. She finds four dead Kobold bodies and some loot. I’m guessing she took what she wanted, as she left saying that there was 2 crossbows left in there if we wanted them. \n\nHonner walks on the path and makes a perception check, detecting vibrations in the ground. He jumps back and slams his hammer into the ground, killing a Kobold and collapsing the tunnel system. 4 more Kobolds jump out of the ground, 2 to the north-eastern side of the bridge (Basically right in front of Vanir), and 2 more to the south-west. \n\nLavena sees the new targets and heads over to a scarecrow to get some cover. She gets within 5 feet and then is asked to make a Will Save. She halfway passes, taking no damage, but the Scarecrow gets an AoO on her, awakening with an unearthly wail. He misses, and Lavena manages to slip a bell around its neck with a Sleight of hand check. \n\nVanir is low on health and facing a 2v1, so he opts to retreat to the bridge. He gains a height advantage, and asks the DM if he can make a left handed throwing knife throw, asking for a -2 penalty. We talk a bit about why I wouldn’t take -4, and I cite that Vanir is somewhat used to throwing knives with his left hand, but not the point of -0 or -1. DM agrees, and I make my two rolls for attack advantage. The second crits, and Vanir skillfully tosses his knife across the river and takes the Kobold through the eye, killing it. \n\nHonner then casts Sacred Flame again, killing the other kobold on the North-Eastern side. The scarecrow takes its turn and attacks Lavena, missing twice. Lavena pulls out her own knives and returns the favor, landing a single glancing blow with a dagger. Vanir and Honner chat on the bridge, joking about her fighting a scarecrow and gaining little ground. We also find out OOC that 2-weapon fighting changed in 5e, with the second attack taking no attack penalty, but instead uses no modifiers at all, just base attack and damage. \n\nVanir makes an INT check to see if a scarecrow would even be able to hear his spells. After failing, he goes with it anyways, and casts Dissonant Whispers on the Scarecrow. The Scarecrow barely passes his will save, but still manages to take half damage.  The DM tells Lavena that she can notice the threads holding the scarecrow together are starting to unravel. Honner once again casts his amazing cantrip, and lights the scarecrow ablaze, killing it with an ear-shattering wail.\n\nThe two Kobolds to the south-west decide to charge the bridge. Vanir takes an AoO on one of them, killing it. Lavena moves away from the scarecrow and draws bow, threatening the Kobold on the bridge. The DM notes that the Kobold is shaken at the deaths of the others, but passes its will save. The DM says the Kobold holds its ground being “More stupid than brave”. He is quickly killed by Vanir on his next turn, and combat ends.  \nThe party makes a few more checks, and take 20 on a medicine check to heal Vanir. They heads down the path toward the forest to the East. They keep finding small splats of blood. We had determined at the campsite that the poor person was probably bashed over the head, which is why there is so little blood to track, and the intermittent occurrences along the path. \n\nAt this point, the DM informs us that he hadn’t created the map for the next area, but asked if we wanted to go forward anyways. We go through with it, and (To our DM’s credit) have a blast even working with only the DM’s descriptions. \n\nThe party heads down the path, into the forest. The woods get darker and dimmer, but our party is fine due to all of the party having some form of darkvision. We walk down the path, making periodic perception checks, when Lavena suddenly makes a reflex save and jumps out of the way. Honner and Vanir follow suit, and manage to dodge a wolf barreling down the path. ROLL INITIATIVE.\n\nVanir and Lavena kill it again, and Honner rolls a 10. The wolf takes a swipe at Honner, but fails his attack. Vanir thinks that it’s a Dire Wolf (The one with the bounty), and casts Dissonant Whispers on it. The wolf fails its save and takes 14 damage, killing it outright. He then walks over to Honner and takes up a defensive position behind him. \n\nLavena opts to climb a tree and makes some perception checks to find more targets. She sees some wolves in the underbrush, and launches an arrow at it, killing one of the two. Two more erupt from the brush, and Honner takes a swipe as it passes by, killing another. He then dashes forward on his next turn and kills another. The woods go quiet, as our adventurers quiver in anticipation. \n\nOur perception checks leave much to be desired, and Kobolds manage to surprise the party (Obviously used the wolves to track us down and ambush us). They rush forward toward Honner and Vanir, attacking the pair. Thanks to them working back to back in defensive postures, they manage to avoid all the blows, and kill two more in defense. Honner casts his OP Cantrip and roasts two more. The last Kobold just saw 4 of its brethren cut down in a few heartbeats, and the DM makes a will save for him. He is shaken, and Vanir pushes him over the edge with an intimidation check. He panics, and breaks for the treeline, invoking AoO as he leaves. \n\nVanir passes his attack, and the DM says that he swishes a “V” into the Kobolds back before taking him through the back of the check. Obvious Zorro reference is obvious, and the party gets a short laugh out of the ordeal. \nThe party continues down the path, once again making periodic checks. We notice a light in the distance, and slowly advance toward the location. We come across a large pit, lit with torches and containing some cages. Vanir makes a perception check and sees the Merchant in a cage. There is a group of Kobolds in the pit, with a Dire wolf in a large cage with a very large Kobold. Dire Wolf pups are separated from their mother in other cages. The large Kobold is unafraid of the Dire Wolf, and seems to be attempting to tame the Dire Wolf.\n\nLavens slinks off to do rogueish stuff, while Honner and Vanir come up with a quick plan. Vanir uses Minor Illusion to replicate the sound of the Scarecrow from earlier. An unearthly wail erupts from the eastern side of the pit, causing the kobolds in the pit to feel uneased. Using this opportunity, Honner casts a spell to panic the Dire Wolf, who then goes berserk on the Large Kobold. It fails its handle animal check and is tackled to the ground. Shortly after, the Dire wolf rips out his throat and begins to try and knock the door of its cage down. \n\nBetween the wail, the panicked dire wolf, the death of their leader, and Lavena now using the poor sops for target practice, the DM says that the Kobolds are now in complete disarray. Honner and Vanir try to stifle their laughs as the Dire Wolf breaks down its cage and lets out its pups. In a short bit, all the Kobolds are killed, and the wolf tends to her young. \n\nNow, we are in a sticky situation. Vanir and Honner can’t leave the merchant to die, and they start to make their way down the pit, attempting to try and ignore the Dire Wolf, banking on it wanting to protect its young rather than attack while wounded. However, a swift arrow from Lavena ends this plan. She hits the wolf, and Vanir acts quickly. I ask the DM to let me use an inspiration die to cast one more level 1 spell. He agrees, and he casts Sleep on the group. All but two of the pups and the mother (She was weakened) fall asleep. We quickly eliminate the other two, and then focus on saving the Merchant. \n\nHonner walks up to the cage, and inspects the man. He determines him to be unconscious, but alive. He brings his Warhammer back to break down the door, but is stopped by Vanir. Vanir says “Let’s be smart about this” and he proceeds to check the body of the dead lead Kobold. Finding a key (and a very curious coin, which turned out to be a “Coin of Fate”), he heads over and releases the man. Honner tends to him, while Vanir and Lavena decide that now is the best time to try and claim the bounty on the wolf. \n\nVanir walks up and attacks the Dire wolf, critically hitting it. This fails to kill it, and it wakes right up. The wolf doesn’t stand up (I wanted to invoke AoO as it did), but rather lets out a loud yelp, waking up its pups. Lavena shoots an arrow and kills the mother, but we still have 3 pups to deal with. \n\nSure enough, they all attack Vanir. 3 grapple checks later, Vanir is on the ground and being ravaged by the pups. Vanir cries out as he falls, screaming “SOME HELP WOULD BE NICE”! Honner jumps up and casts Sacred Flame, lighting two ablaze and killing them. The dead pups fall on Vanir, giving him half cover. \nVanir takes his turn, and decides to cast his Vicious Mockery cantrip on the final pup, hoping to make it have disadvantage on its next attack. DM decides to have fun with me, asking what the spell does. I describe it, and he says “Lets hear this string of insults”. \n\nThe best I come up with on the fly was “Get of me you mangy cur! Your mother was thrice the wolf you’ll ever be, and she’s over there lying dead on the ground!”. I deal a meagre 5 damage, but somehow manage to kill it. DM says “The pup lets out a sigh, and collapses dead on top of you, having lost the will to live.” I felt slightly bad about that…..\n\nAnyways, Vanir picks himself back up and Honner goes to check on the merchant. We forgot about Lavena again, and she sprints over and takes the head of the Dire Wolf. Honner and Vanir both get up and say “You know we’re sharing that right?”\n\nLavena laughs at us. Persuasion and deception checks all around. Honner and Vanir manage to talk Lavena down, and they split the bounty. The party makes a few more checks, and also spends some time to skin a few of the wolves. We use some skin for profit, and a bit for personal uses. Vanir uses fur from the Dire Wolf to line his cloak (So he doesn’t get chilly later). The Merchant promises to repay us somehow, and is eternally grateful to all of us. \n\nHeading back to town, we go our separate ways for the night, with the Rogue going god-knows-where. Honner heads to the chapel and Vanir heads to the local tavern again. Vanir decides to gamble, using his deception check this time around (We did a few checks in the Core manual, and gambling runs off of deception somehow). He rolls a sick 26 deception, and walks away with 40 GP, a steak, a belt and pair of shoes, and someones dog. \n\nNaturally, I inquire about the dog. It’s a plain dog that knows basic tricks. Vanir gives it a steak, and names it Fenris. We have gained a new companion. With this, Vanir falls on his bed and rests. \n\n----\n\nOnce again, feel free to point out any mistakes we make. We are new to 5e, and working our way through it. \n\nProps to our amazing DM as well. I gave him a paper I found online about DM’ing and making combat encounters, which was written by the “Angry DM”. His encounters are already shaping up a lot better, with more surprises, tactics, and enemies custom made for the group. The scarecrow was thrown in to negate my Sleep spell on it, and I’m sure he will throw in some mobs next time that will resist Sacred Flame as well. He likes to keep us on our toes :D\n\nWe play on Friday and Saturday at 11pm PST, so I will always be a bit in writing these up. If you’re waiting on them, make sure you annoy me on Reddit, as I will probably put it off over the weekend, studying and shit (DAMN YOU ORGANIC CHEM)\n",

        "text": "[Yet another silly story from my silly campaign!](http://redd.it/2sj261) This time, [the party (consisting of Rose the dullahan ranger, Pratena the voracious cyclops muderchild, Fishnaut the starry-eyed gillman sorcerer, and Barrel the halfling rogue)](http://imgur.com/a/kBl11) decided that they would like to get their hands on some neat magical gear. To that end, they headed off to a nearby dungeon that their boss just happened to know about.\n\nThey arrived at a long, straight, hallway-looking place loaded with what were very obviously traps. Not twenty feet from the entrance was a pressure plate that swung a giant spinning sawblade through the air. But the party wasn’t having with any of “getting eviscerated” business, they had come prepared.\n\nEnter Buster v2! The party had been lugging around a small goblin corpse for about two weeks, and he was the party’s point man. It was him that valiantly took every blast of flames, every spinning sawblade, every blade pendulum, and every hail of darts. What a champ. What a team player.\n\nThere was a problem, though- their cautious journey through the trap-infested hallways was a slow one, and the loot at the end of the corridor was quite visible- it was on a conveyor belt feeding into a large, faintly glowing pit.\n\nThe party accelerated, relying less and less on their pal Buster. They ran into some particular troubles with the less conventional traps- at one point, Rose was pulled violently into the wall by a powerful magnet. Fishnaut handled that with the pinpoint application of one Hydraulic Push, and the now-rather-soggy party was up against their most devious foe yet- foliage.\n\nYes, foliage. A section of the hallway had apparently given way to a patch of dense grass, moss, flowering plants, and odd bushes. It was suspicious as hell, especially after Fishnaut barely managed a will save against falling asleep from spores. So Rose powered up her new ranger trick- a spell called Defoliate.\n\nThe shrubbery immediately withered and died, leaving only wilted husks and two four-armed monstrosities, looking a bit sheepish after their hiding places had been thoroughly blasted away. Roll for initiative!\n\nBarrel decided there wasn’t time for this, and leapt ahead of the horrible creatures, nimbly dodging opportunistic attacks and a hail of arrow traps. He was to grab the loot off of the conveyor belt before it all went away, while the rest of the party took care of business.\n\nIt was a slapfest. These hideous creatures were STRONG, and they had a seriously unfair number of attacks in a single round. Rose was furiously tanking, and Pratena just couldn’t lay on the hurt as much as her opponent. Fishnaut provided support by way of heat-beams and lightning bolts, which eventually toppled the godawful thing attacking Pratena about a round before she would have dropped.\n\nThe second abomination was a lot easier, as Rose had jammed her shield down its throat and then proceeded to get an absolutely astounding number of critical hits in a row. Seriously, out of six attacks, four were criticals! Once both monstrosities were down, the party immediately set about jabbing pointy things into every vaguely important-looking internal organ in the bastards, just to make sure they would stay down.\n\nBarrel, meanwhile, had secured the loot and only marginally contributed to the battle. He spent the next few rounds disabling traps (and imitating a pole dancer on a swinging pendulum). The party slogged through the rest of it, and claimed their prizes- a trio of magical artifacts and two chests filled with gold (who put those there!?). The only downside was that three other artifacts had been thrown into the pit, which was quite obviously filled with fire.\n\nAfter a bit more searching, they found a side-passage that led straight back to the entrance of the hallway. It also contained maintenance hatches for each of the traps, and a back room filled with the artifacts that had been dropped down the pit- wait, what?\n\nThe party did some sleuthing. It turned out that the whole “dungeon” was under magical surveillance from a little observation room, and its resident was likely the one resetting the traps and replacing the artifacts after each group of adventurers got eviscerated by the traps and the resident monsters. When the party had made it through the worst of it, whoever it was had bolted- all that was left was a collection of “greatest hits” and a mountain of popcorn.\n\nWith that, the party headed home, loot in tow. The group was happy with all the money they had raised, and Pratena was happy because the four-armed abominations were HUGE and would feed her for DAYS. Priorities!\n\n[NEXT TIME ON “The joys of interior redecorating”, MISSING PERSONS AND A REAL CLUSTER FUCK!](http://redd.it/2uczwo)",

        "text": "A month ago, I started a game of Vampire: The Masquerade with a few friends and relatives of mine, the majority of whom were inexperienced at roleplay. Which is fair, because I'm new as a baby's balls at storytelling, so it's a learning experience for all. That said, my inexperience has allowed a pair of the particularly inexperienced players to run a little wild with their characters, as I shall demonstrate.\n\nSet in the streets of New York, the party is gathered by the Prince and forced into a coterie for his convenience, seeing as he has larger threats to deal with compared to some fresh meat. The cast is varied, no one having the same clan as another, creating some interesting tension between the players:\n\n* **Valentine,** a Ventrue noble from pre-fascist Italy who is the childe of the Prince of Florence. A 10th generation vampire, he's pretty reputable, but burned most of his points in backgrounds and social skills, so he needs someone to watch his back. He's played by my friend Mitch, who is new to roleplay but understands the concepts very well.\n\n* **Patrick,** the Nosferatu, a bruiser with intellect that wants to set himself up as an information broker. Another 10th generation, he is the childe of a Nosferatu primogen from Chicago, and has a serious moral code that stems from his player, Mark, being very good-oriented and ethical in how he plays. Skilled roleplayer, he is, otherwise.\n\n* **Aaron,** a Malkavian former drug dealer of the 13th generation. His insanity stems from his OCD, namely that he smokes a ton of cigarettes regularly, which is hilarious because I make him roll a courage check to ensure he doesn't run in terror at the flames. He's played by my brother Troy. Completely inexperienced, but he's getting a hang of it.\n\n* And, lastly, there's **Phillod,** a Tremere who is delusional in his love for the occult, and thinks HP Lovecraft to have been some sort of seer. 13th generation and played by someone who knows the game but has never played any sort of roleplay. Played by my cousin DK.\n\nSo after a night on the town, the party gathers themselves in a quiet apartment that they'll be using for the night, where they collect themselves after the night's events. Quickly Patrick and Valentine break off to talk strategy, while Phillod and the Aaron respectively go off to prep their rooms for the night.\n\nMoments later, the Malkavian decides that he needs to consult the Tremere's occult knowledge on some information he learned that night. He knocks on the door, and spying on him through the peephole, Phillod demands knowledge of who is on the other side. What resulted was a perfectly stupid dialogue fitting the insane characters that were involved.\n\n&gt; Aaron: \"It's me.\"\n\n&gt; Phillod: \"Me who?\"\n\n&gt; Aaron: \"...The Malkavian?\"\n\n&gt; Phillod: \"Which one!?\"\n\nAaron's player Troy looked to me with confusion, and I rolled my hands signalling for him to respond in character.\n\n&gt; Aaron: \"Uh... Aaron?\"\n\nAnd then comes the most dreadful line of dialogue I've yet to hear in all my single-digit days as a storyteller.\n\n&gt; Phillod: \"Prove it.\"\n\nBoth the players look to me for guidance. I'm a bit dumbfounded, because I was trying to pay equal attention to their ramblings as I was to the serious conversation between Valentine and Patrick, which touched on serious plot points I was leading them towards. But that stole my attention.\n\nObviously there was only one way I could take that, though.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Uh... Troy, roll charisma to convince him that you're the you you say you are. Difficulty... Six?\"\n\nNow, if you're unfamiliar with VTM's rolling mechanic, a player can use up to ten dice to try and succeed at a roll, combining a trait, like charisma, with an ability, like, say, streetwise. Unfortunately, I didn't see anything that Troy had to possibly convince someone of his being, so I kept it straight charisma.\n\nHe rolled. Two successes, one botch, leaving a single success.\n\n&gt; Me: \"You are convincing in your defense of your person, but you leave the distinct possibility open that you might be a clone, shapeshifter or illusion.\"\n\nPhillod allowed Aaron in, and proceeded to quiz him on key facts of his life to ensure he wasn't going to accidentally spill clan or coterie secrets to a Sabbat spy.",

        "text": "Verlanndrian Zothrax was the tallest, so he saw the dead body first. It was laying on its back in the town green, its broken limbs mangled into the letter \"R.\" Someone had pushed up the dewy dust around it into guides so that the blood pooling beneath it would fill into the shape of a bright red cape. Verlanndrian bared his sharp teeth, clenching his thick claws. He recognized the corpse's face.\n\n\"Arvius,\" said a voice behind Verlanndrian. It sounded cold, noble, and poisonous. Verlanndrian turned to face the owner of that voice, knowing it could be only one person. Althaea Dragonblood was tall and barely there like most high elves Verlanndrian had met, but her scent tasted like a magic forest and her eyes were cloaked in faint dragon scales. Since the first time he'd seen her anger flare--seen her scales deepen into an emerald domino mask--he had felt like her pet dragon. \n\nVerlanndrian didn't think there was much honor in being someone else's pet.\n\nAlthaea locked eyes with Verlanndrian. Was he ensorcelled? It felt like it because he couldn't look away. His heart quickened, his muscles slackened. He wanted the moment to end. He wanted it to last forever. \n\nA wet, sandy thump by Verlanndrian's clawed feet broke the spell. It was Godfrey, squirming face down in the dewy dust. Althaea's beauty had made Verlanndrian forget he was carrying Godfrey under his arm. He carried Godfrey most mornings. It gave his brother time to work off the drink.\n\nGodfrey spluttered through a mouthful of dirt and sand. \"By the silver bolt of Heironeous, Zozo!\" \n\nVerlanndrian took no offense at Godfrey's name for him. As the only other member of the Verlanndrian clan, use of that name was Godfrey's privilege. There was nothing to be done about his brother's grumpiness, either. \"Forgive me, brother,\" Verlanndrian said, truly concerned. \"I have dishonored you.\" Verlanndrian propped up Godfrey against his thick, blue leg, pulling him off the ground with one hand as if he and his armor weighed no more than a halfling. Verlanndrian pulled a poorly rolled cigarette from his pouch and put it in Godfrey's mouth, helping Godfrey find his gnomish trinket. Each night, Verlanndrian had Godfrey roll a few cigarettes for the morning. It gave Verlanndrian time to find Godfrey more tobacco.\n\nGodfrey pushed the trinket into the cigarette's tip, shielding the connection with his free hand. After a moment, he returned the trinket to his pocket, pulling hard and long on the cigarette. He exhaled smoke in a low cloud, rubbing his temples. Verlanndrian smiled. When Godfrey smoked, Verlanndrian always thought it made him look like a smoldering silver dragon. \n\nGodfrey squinted in the morning sunlight at the corpse ahead of him, seeing but not seeing. Then he widened his eyes, pointing. \"The monk!\"\n\nAlthaea drifted to Verlanndrian's side, filling his thin, forked tongue with her magic forest scent. \"I just said that,\" she said, crossing her arms.\n\n\"It's the Redbrands,\" Godfrey said. \"This is vengeance for last night.\"\n\nDurzhof the thief materialized from nowhere, his cloak's hood pulled over his face. To Verlanndrian, the human rogue was like a black dragon, a cunning lover of ambushes. There was no denying his intelligence, though. Pik'Chut was there, too. Verlanndrian didn't know what to make of him, but the dragonborn knew the bard was smart. It took the human and the tiefling only a moment to inspect the corpse and the town green before knowing what to do next.\n\n\"Footprints, leading off this way,\" Durzhof said from underneath his hood. \"They're fresh.\"\n\t\n*Scene break*\n\nThe footprints led to a farm on the eastern edge of town. A halfling woman named Qelline Alderleaf pointed Verlanndrian and his party to Tresendar Manor. \"That's the Redbrand base,\" she said. \"I'm sure of it.\" \n\nHer boy Carp led Verlanndrian to a secret forest entrance beneath the manor, bubbling over about becoming an adventurer himself one day. Verlanndrian thought the boy had honorable dreams. The path Carp showed Verlanndrian led into a vast cavern supported by two natural pillars. A ravine cut through the middle of it, filled with strange, gray vapor. It was too dark for Verlanndrian to see much else, so Althaea loosed a bright light into the cavern's ceiling. It was shaped like a green flower.\n\nIn the green light, Verlanndrian could see a monster crouching behind one of the pillars. It had leathery skin, knife-like claws, and a single, disgusting eyeball. Pik'Chut stepped into the cavern, pushing back the brim of his black hat. \"A nothic,\" he said. \"Fascinating creature, you know. Nothics are wizards who pushed too far into the realm of dark magic. An interesting but terrible fate, don't you think?\"\n\nThe nothic tore at its stomach with its long claws. \"I'm so hungry,\" it said, whispering.\n\nHad it said anything, though? Verlanndrian couldn't be sure.\n\n\"Eeeeeeeeeeat,\" it said again, a little louder.\n\nNo, Verlanndrian was sure now. The nothic's lips weren't moving.\n\n\"Hungry!\" the nothic said, yelling. Then it cackled. Pain shot through Verlanndrian's forehead, running down his spine. The dragonborn turned away from the nothic, clutching his skull.\n\n\"Telepathy,\" Pik'Chut said, wincing. He took another step into the cavern. \"Fascinating. I wonder if I can--\"\n\nThe end of Pik'Chut's words were drowned out by more cackling inside Verlanndrian's mind. The nothic's psychic screech filled Verlanndrian with the pain of hunger in his belly. Against his will, his items flashed before him in rapid succession as clearly as if he were holding each one in his claws. His mind landed on an image of the horse jerky he had pulled off Sildar's mount. \n\n\"Hungry!\" the nothic said, excited.\n\nAlmost without thought, Verlanndrian pulled the jerky out of his sack and tossed it toward the monster. The nothic seized the beast's flank and tore at it, filling Verlanndrian's mind with a sense of delight. It was revolting.\n\nDurzhof was barely visible in the shadows of the cave entrance. \"Let's get past it while we can,\" he said.\n\nThe party hustled to a bridge that spanned the misty ravine, but Godfrey would let no one cross. \"It looks weak,\" he said. \"We need another way around.\"\n\nVerlanndrian glanced at the nothic. It was halfway through the chunk of horse jerky already. That same amount would have lasted Verlanndrian at least a day. \"We have no time, brother,\" he said.\n\nVerlanndrian bent down near the edge of the ravine, clasping his fingered claws together into a step. To help Godfrey and his new friends would be an honor, he thought. The chance to earn that honor drove pure adrenaline into the cords of his muscles. \"I'll boost you,\" he said. \n\nGodfrey frowned, hesitating. To Godfrey's surprise, Durzhof slipped past him without a noise. He was into Verlanndrian's hands and over the misty ravine in a moment. Pik'Chut went next, his heavy, black, floor-length coat flapping in the wind. Pleased with himself, Verlanndrian turned toward Althaea and flexed his arms, feeling the strength of a blue dragon flowing into him. His eyes were wide with pride.\n\nVerlanndrian's eyes narrowed back to slits a moment later. He saw that Althaea hadn't paid any attention to his incredible display of strength. In fact, she was flitting across the bridge Godfrey had determined to be unfit for any weight. She reached the other side with ease, then smirked. Verlanndrian couldn't tell if she was mocking him, Godfrey, or both him and Godfrey.\n\nEven still, Verlanndrian felt the strength of his ancestral dragons coursing through his body. He threw Godfrey with ease, then cleared the ravine of his own accord, producing a single, mighty jump from the power of his haunches. He caught up with his party as they ran to the back of the cavern and found a secret door into the basement of Tresendar Manor.",

        "text": "**Warning wall of text** \n\nWe open up with me being the game master, my friend cody the ice mage, Kitty; a druid who in human form is a vampire who can only talk in meows and in cat form can only talk like a human, and finally we have Kyle the monkey wielding a staff \n\nThe walk through the forest with kitty riding cody's head. Its getting late by the time they reach town, Kyle and Kitty check into a hotel and Cody goes find place to make a nice ice shelter. He finds the perfect crevice! Theres even a blanket inside! He makes a door of ice and goes to sleep. Around one in the morning, kitty tries suffocating kyle with cat fur but falls off his face and then cody hears a knock on his ice door. He opens it and see a very fancy homeless man, saying that is his spot. Cody lets him in and they spend the night on opposite sides of the crevice, the hobo man is very nice, classy, and also thinks he is a yeti (he's human). In the morning at the hotel kitty and kyle go to the all you can eat breakfest place and has stacks of pancakes, kitty is now in human/vampire form by the way. Cody tries to lose the homeless man in the crowd at the market and finds a nice yeti hunting business. Also I forgot to mention, the town surrounded by mountains. Cody signs up and the lady there says they are just waiting for fred. Oh there he is! Cody turns around and sees the hobo in a clown mask (he dosnt want the people to know he's a yeti). They head to the hotel to grab Cody's friends before they go into the mountain. Cody goes into the breakfest area and the townsfolk are in awe at how much pancakes they both ate. You hear in the kitchen the buff chef panicking \"WHERE ARE THE PANCAKES. WHERE ARE THE WAFFLES.\" Kyle has one waffle left on his plate. He sees cody wants it cause hes hungry. The chef  and cody are both charging, kitty throws it up in the air. The chef makes it first but cody tackles him. They both punch eachother but cody uses ice powers to keep him down and they all walk out.  The whole group head up the mountains. Kyle suggests they should all have nametags and fred thinks its a good idea and tells samantha the secretary to take a note. They reach a led and fred whose leading everyone stops at a ledge. \"Ok I assume everyone knows the standard yeti huntin procedure, this is the yeti hunting ledge. Please get your traps ready. Samantha  takes out a bear trap and swings it in the air like a mace. They are all are hunting in the misty snowy yeti hunting ledge. Cody and Kyle lag beind the group and disguise Kyle as a yeti because he is a monkey after all. Cody goes back up to the group and suggests they use a yeti hunting call. Fred says he will but cody stops him and does his own. Fred the hobo who thinks hes a yeti sees a yeti in the distance and you can almost see hearts in his eyes. He tells the others theres a yeti over there but points in a different direction and the group goes that way. Kyle sees all this. Yep that yeti was real not the monkey disguised as one. Fred takes off his mask to show the yeti he's a real one   (not really hes just crazy). Fast forward a bit, the yeti is 10 feet under snow because of cody, and fred sees his love get crushed. He yells to the group, angry at cody and wants them to attack, tells them he sabotaged the yeti hunt! Quickly before they get over, kitty bites him and turns him to a vampire slave. She makes him assure the villagers everythings alright but he lost his mask. 2 villagers go down the mountain, and three others (including semantha) dig in the snow. They find the dead yeti and fred sees this. With a broken heart and a fit of pure rage he breaks out of the vampire spell and charges after cody. Fast forward more because of a lightning bolt (kyles also a lightning mage) an avalanche is going down. So just picture this, an avalanche, cody and a cat with a dead yeti inside a boat of ice surfing the avalanche, a fancy hobo vampire dead in the avalanche, two angry villagers chasing a monkey whose holding a bear trap holding his staff, with two non angry villagers running in front of him. Kitty is singing let it go and Kyle singing he's king of the mountain. Fast forward after avalanche, the whole town is buried besides gram gram whose in a rocking chair, and our three adventurers now have a dead hobo in a wooden/ice cart. \n\nSorry if it was poorly written, I'm in a rush and dont feel like writing a whole novel with every detail. Also imagine the yeti as [a white version of this](http://i.imgur.com/9Xlv66l.jpg?1)\n\n**TLDR: A monkey, cat, and an ice mage walk into a town, go up a mountain, turn a fancy hobo who thinks hes a yeti into a vampire, kill him and a real yeti, run down the mountain singing frozen music, and end up burying the whole town and saving gram gram.**\n\n",

        "text": "Good morning peoples! I'm Hidd- and I have a tale of something silly that happened to me last night.\n\nI'm The DM for my group of warmachine playing friends, My wife is playing our elven wizard, my best friend is playing a intelligently challenged human fighter, and we have a couple playing his and hers cleric and rogue (both humans.\n\nI warn you- should you be wanting to play through the starter campaign there will be spoilers, But it isn't exact, because hat campaign is.\n\nOur intrepid group has slogged its way through the cragmaw cave and had elected to elevate the minor bugbear above his station by beheading the current clan leader and trading said head for the human bodyguard of their employer sildar.\n\nThe group then cleaned out the redbrand alehouse and hideout slaying glassstaff before even talking to him much. The wiz is now in possession of the glass staff and the Fgtr has the +1 longsword they took from the nothic. Pretty basic level 1-2 stuff.\n\n-We're maybe 3-4 sessions in and this is mostly a learning campaign. I have 2 binders full of hooks and plots I'm able to throw at them at any time. So I'm a little wary about slaughtering them in one fell swoop. I've fudged a couple rolls and only left them unconscious. It happens.\n\nThus begins last nights session.  \nOur Stalwart group has just seen Sildar leave for Waterdeep to confer with the council about glasstaff's ally the spider- who we now is a drow something or other. The party looks a bit ragged from slugging through the hideout, and approaches the shrine in town for healing. (I think I made it Tymora's- having recently re-read erevis cale's books) The priestess heals them for donations and also identifies their new loot! Shiny! but seems distressed.  The party is clued into this by my many sighs and woe is me tone of voice and ask what the problem is.  \n\nI lay the plot hooks for Agatha the banshee lady and mention needing the shiny bauble since this banshee is rather vain. They agree to accept this quest, but require food and drink at the inn before heading off. The party rests up acquires spell slots and some food/rations and then immediately heads off to find said banshee-since it is on the way to their current plot hook idea. they want the potions of healing, but are also on the way to Thundertree- (There's a loner druid up there that'll escort them to the Cragmaw keep. Courtesy of some random  ex-adventurer halfling farmer and all...)\n\nI read the description of the banshee hut appearing in the middle of the path before them as the branches close in around them. A shimmering shining ghostly elven banshee appears before them and asks what they are there for. The Fgrt tenses up in real life  as the rogue remembers they don't have the bauble and screams this at the table\n\"WE ARE SENT HERE FROM THE PRIESTESS GULLYMUG FROM THE TEMPLE OF TYMORA TO ASK YOU WHERE THE SPELLBOOK SHE HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR IS DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS??!!?!\" all caps irl for srs business.\n\nNow I know they didn't go back for the bauble, but would have given them the answer if they had asked nicely or at least rp'd a bit not just screamed at the banshee.  She screamed at them blacking them out and they wake up 10 minutes later on the empty trail.\n\nThey decide to go back to the town and get the bauble. The priestess is rather upset since they did say to her they'd stop by before they headed out.  Apparently the banshee only appears once to each group, and tagging along a random bystander to ask the banshee doesn't work either. They were sad- but hey there's a druid to find and they figure they're low level so they could do without the three pot's o' healin'.\n\nWe travel for a couple days forward without any interference to Thunder tree. I have them arrive at nightfall at the western edge. They look for some shelter and choose the abandoned tavern. \n\n\"We walk in\" \n\"Roll for initiative\" heh.  They kill the 4 ash zombies. The fighter kills one zombie with another zombie throwing it as a nonliving missile. It was heroic.\n\nThe party is awakened in the night by noises of shuffling and moaning outside- but had barricaded the door so they were ok for the moment.\n\nAfter waking up the first order was to find aid druid. They ask which house looks most defensible, and the druid's house is rather near where they are so I describe it and they head that direction. \n\nThe druid is kind of standoffish and will gladly lead them to the cragmaw keep in exchange for running off the dragon. He has not the time nor resources to deal with him- but to stay away from the other side of town there's some creepy cultists making noise. the party asks if the druid will help, and he says no- I'm taxed as it is here\" They reluctantly agree.\n\nEnter the dragin. /sigh.\n\nSo the group heads off to the cottage. Creepy domed cottage with a tower attached. They walk up to the front door and kick it in unsuccessfully (alerting the dragon) A 2 will not kick down a door. I figure the back door only needed a 10 or so dc, and they do kick that one down successfully.\n\nNothing of value in the cottage but cobwebs and broken furniture. That and a door to the tower. \n\nme:\"Marching order please\"\n\n\"Rogue, fighter, cleric,mage\" \n\nme:\"alright. door doesn't seem to be locked. What do you want to do?\"\n\nRogue:\" I open the door and walk in\"\n\nme:\" As you open the door you are hit with a blast of acrid smoke that burns your nostrils. You see two large green orbs staring at you from the darkness- you hear a growling and a deep voice asks:\"Why do you come unbidden into my home adventurers' he apparently was aware of your presence. It was probably the pounding on the doors\" All the s's are super elongated. That's how my dragons talk.\n\nThe rogue apologizes for barging in uninvited and is trying to fast talk to the dragon explaining \"they're there on a mission from the druid who lives in the town, and wants nothing to do with the dragon, but they were sent to ask if there was some way an accord could be reached that the dragon and druid could co-habitate.\" \n\nDragon:\"Why is it you are helping this druid, what is he to you?\"\n\nRogue: \"Well, we are in need of the druid's assistance. you see our friend is kidnapped and held by goblins in a castle- we need his help to rescue our friend and this is a favor to him.\"\n\n-Now whilst I was reading the description of the dragon in the book looking for a description or layout of the tower there's a sentence at the end of the listing saying \"Dragons are lawful evil and delight in nothing more than corrupting the good of heart which lead to the next part-\n\nDragon:\" I know of this castle infested with goblinkin. I have no love for the smaller races. I offer you this option. I will assist you in the rescue of your friend and kill the goblins for you. You only need do me one thing. Bring me the head of the druid and it will be done\"\n\nFighter: \"Fuck this I charge the dragon\"\n\nRogue: \"WHAT? NO!\"\n\nCleric\"oh nooo.\"\n\nMage:\"Fuck my life\" \n\nMe: \"Roll for initiative\"\n-look at the map they're all lined up in a row. Breath weapon time. Give the fgtr a charge attack and breath weapon. Look at the stats. Shit. A successful save by everyone will still TPK the party. Whatever. Breath weapon anyways. The rogue is doing meta math on hit points of a dragon and guessing like 130-120 hp.\n\nThe fgtr hits for like 14 damage. \n\n12 points done to the entire party because I'm nice and everyone is at 2-12 hp somewhere.\n\nRogue goes first in initiative order after the surprise round.\n\nRogue:\" I run away \"\n\ncleric:\"fuck no stay (this is his irl gf)\n\nmage:\" Fuck my life so much (my eloquent wife)\n\n\nRogue\"I run and dont stop\n\nme:\" to where?\"\n\nRogue:\" I don't care- the town- my shop in waterdeep\"\n\nnext round the dragon takes like 12 damage from the mage's burning hands, and the cleric rolls a 1 to his guiding bolt. the fighter is summarily smacked to the ground and the dragon misses his other attacks. \n\nThe mage then decides to run away and takes a freestrike and dies.\n\nThe cleric heals the fighter and pops a potion o healing for some restored hp.\n\n\nFighter pops back up and the dragon starts chuckling\n\ndragon:\"You can still take my offer and walk out of here. Kill this meddlesome druid and I will assist you.\n\nFighter:\" I look at him and say fuck you and swing\"\n\nme:\"ok\"\nhe hits for another like 8 damage.\n\nEven using second wind I obliterate him and leave the whole party other than the rogue unconscious.\nme to rogue:\" You make it to the bottom of the road leading to the tower and hear a growling coming from the direction of the exit of the town.\n\nrogue:\"I keep running\"\n\nme:\" as you continue on you see an enormous muscled grizzly bear charging headlong towards you it is easily three times the size of a normal bear.\n\nrogue:\"damnit I throw rations at it and duck off the road\"\n\nme:\"it charges by you heading towards the tower\"\n\nrog:\"oh, maybe it's the druid- I sit and watch\"\n\nme:\" everyone in the tower: roll a d20 see who is conscious and who is not.\n\nthe cleric and fgtr make it.\n\nme:\"you hear an crash and the tower shakes. The east wall implodes and a massive furry shape charges in and latches on to the dragon. The dragon immediately sprays acid all over the bear's pelt and the flash on the shoulder starts to bubble and ooze. The Bear-thing tosses the dragon and the wall and lumbers over to it stomping down on it and raking it with it's claws. The dragon manages to get it's hind legs under itself and push the bear away and take off towards the sky to escape. 'rogue, you see the tower shaking and debris flying everywhere. The green dragon then comes flying out the hole in the roof and the place goes quiet.\n\n\"The bear shrinks down to human size and slumps on the ground while wiggling his hands and chanting a song. You are all healed to 2 hp.\"\n\nAll three hurt party members take the axe, gold and goblets from the horde and walk sullenly back with the druid. the druid ignores  the rogue and tells them to meet him back at his house.  Yelling ensues. The fghtr punches the rogue down to 2hp. \n\nMy rogue is angry that his character isn't dumb enough to be in this party. The cleric is made because the rogue left, and the fighter charged. the mage was expecting me to kill everyone to allow them to reroll. The fighter thought it was awesome.\n\nAs they argue I'm rolling a percentile dice to see if anything can hear them. They see me doing this and think it best to mosey on to the hut.\n\nThe druid is hurt and mixing some poultices. And his house is ransacked.  We end there. 2 people had to work that night and get on to work. Pretty sure the rogue wants to reroll to a paladin now or something. I may make him hold off. Not too sure where to go from here. Probably have them retrieve the druids stuff from the cultist's hideout to level them up again before they hit up cragmaw keep.\n\nI'm still chuckling about it. The rogue really wanted the dragon's help.\n\n ",

        "text": "Okay, so I finished my ever D&amp;D campaign and started a new one called \"The Wizards Challenge\". We also transitioned into 5e for this campaign. I had lots of fun playing a monk, and REALLY wanted to roll another, but I decided to go with a Bard instead. I had thoroughly enjoyed my previous campaign, and decided to chronicle the next adventure, after our hi-jinks had left me speechless throughout most of the campaign. \n\nAnways, meet Vanir von Richter, the half-elf bard. I had also lucked out on finding the token picture for Roll20, because a quick google search brought an almost [picture perfect version of him](http://thecage.wdfiles.com/local--files/pc:quintus/Quintus01.jpg) that I had envisioned (Minus the cape). Begin campaign. \n\n----\n\nThe party starts out in front of a very large wizards tower. They are told that the wizard has designed countless floors that can contain almost anything within, from separate biomes and so on (Each floor is basically a separate plane. One floor could be a pristine valley, the next a volcanic ruin. I asked him OOC if he got inspiration from SAO, which he begrudgingly admitted). There are lots of adventurer groups around the wizard tower, all for the same goal, reaching the top to get some benefit that I have already forgotten. \n\nWe take a short bit of time to talk to each other. Party is currently three, but will be four once someone gets some computer problems fixed. I go and start chatting with the Dwarven priest in front of me. I have no idea about dwarven religions (Vanir roamed mostly in human lands), so ask about the symbol on his chest. He tells me its the symbol of Moridan, yada yada yada, I have no fucking clue. Roll religion. DM says I know enough to be lightly familiar with it. Roll CHA and say that Vanir loudly exclaims \"Ooooh, Moridan!\" and launches into a conversation, making it seem like he knows all about the dwarven God. DM just comments, \"Typical Bard\"\n\nTeifling rogue is number three, and is quickly determined to be antisocial. We get nowhere. I take a bit more time and chat with the group of Halfling adventurers that he told us about earlier. I ask about the group, and he tells me that they are drinking happily and that I notice that they are particularly ill-equipped as adventurers. Vanir is Chaotic Good, so I don't let that slide. I tell him that I politely inform them that they are ill-equipped and offer advice. I get a decent roll, but the effect is mitigated by the fact that they are all pretty drunk. I am told that they listen, but don't take it too seriously. I decide not to press the matter, and walk away with some drink myself (It's pretty weak though)\n\nHead back, form up with group. Offer beer to Honnor (The dwarf), and am told to \"Get that weak shit out of my face\". I am quickly informed OOC of dwarves and how they are with beer. DM mentions that dwarves are \"The IPA guys of beers. Mine is better than yours\". Anyways, the Tower opens, I down the rest and we head in. Wordlessly, the Wizard hands each person there a crystal. Honnor tries to ask what it does, but he is ignored. Once everyone has a crystal, the wizard throws something on the ground and teleports. \n\nNaturally, we all start rolling to figure out what this is. Honnor figures it out, looks at us all, tells us briefly what it does (In a very dwavish fashion) and then promptly throws his crystal down and teleports. \n\nEnter floor one, the idyllic plane. Its green, warm and happy, with trees and some old ruins around. Rogue goes north to investigate something. She thought that the tree icon was a pile of something, and starts rolling investigations. DM has bit of fun informing her that it is a tree, and that she can climb it. \n\nMe and Moridan march forward, with me playing my banjo for a marching tune. Rogue climbs the tree and finds the village to the north, so we start to head that way. Suddenly, Kobolds spring out of the ground. Roll Initiative. Before actions, I notice that one of them sprung up right in front of me, with his back facing me. \"Do I get an attack of opportunity?\" DM says yes, but notes that nobody has drawn a weapon yet. We all just realized that nobody actually had a weapon drawn, so we were going to waste an action to ready ourselves. \n\nVanir, however, is holding his banjo. I tell the DM, I'm going to hit him with my banjo. Silence. DM chuckles a bit and goes, \"Okay, but that's an improvised weapon\". Dwarf player drops a bombshell and mentions that I'm proficient with banjo's (Which I am).Everyone laughs out loud and we take a bit to iron out the details. He lets me use it as a proficient weapon, and we decide that it deals 1d2 damage. I ask for weight class, and he determines it to be a light weapon. I use finesse. I roll +5 with my banjo, hit him and deal 4 damage, killing the kobold. And this encounter gets crazier from here. \n\nRogue attempts to bow shot from the tree, crit fails, but keeps her balance. Since she had to draw, she also has no more actions. Kobolds killed us on Initiative, and move in to attack us. Banjo Attack of Opportunity downs another. Honnor takes his turn and smashes a kobold to death with his warhammer, and then intimidates the other so badly he attempts to go back into the hole he came from (The kobold mind you). Vanir uses his turn to cast sleep on a group of 'bolds in front of him, getting another AoO as it drops. Banjo 3 - Kobold 0\n\nWe quickly mop up the rest, with a spell from the Cleric doing most of the work. Rogue is pissed that she didn't get to do much. We suddenly get pelted by stones by a flying Kobold. We all pass our reflex checks, Honnor crits and throws the stone back at him. Arrow fails, and Vanir is up again. Kobold is almost gone, about 90 ft away. I move into range and cast sleep on him in midair. DM goans a bit, because sleep has no save. I roll 5d8 to see how much HP I affect. At low levels, sleep is almost OP. The Kobold falls asleep in midair, drops to the ground, takes fall damage and dies. DM mentions if we have read the bounty board he posted for the campaign. We all realize that the Flying Kobold is worth 150 GP in the next town. \n\nRogue and I are both trying to get the loot first (I'm fairly certain that Rogue is CN. Did nothing to hurt him, but wanted to claim the body for herself). Thankfully, LG Dwarf is next on initiative, and sprints and grabs it, saying that we will split it. Before we leave, we check out the ruins a bit more. Rogue finds a GP in one of the holes, and the Dwarf tries to examine the ruins. He learns that they are magically made walls and exclaims \"Fucking magic\". Talks with the DM and they both determine that the ruins would be sacrilege to the dwarf. I mention that I imagined him kicking the wall as he said \"Fucking magic\" and he decides to try and knock the wall down with a hammer. He rolls a 16, but I give him bardic inspiration to roll a 1d6 to help. He ends up with a 21, and knocks off a large portion of the wall. Both he and I get inspiration for the encounter. \n\nWe all head to town, and redeem the bounty. I head over to the tavern to try and gain some gold gambling (I have a charlatan background, so I claim that I would be better than most at playing cards, even without cheating). I make no money, but do manage to score free drinks. I head off to find the Dwarf, asking the DM if I would be able to assume that he would be at the chapel. \n\nFLAW TIME. Vanir has a humorous flaw. The man has a HORRIFYING sense of direction. Not only that, but he is always convinced he is heading the right way, which will probably lead to disaster later in the campaign. He will be convinced he is right, and will no doubt try to persuade the others to let him lead since \"He knows the way\". I hope they figure out my flaw before this happens. DM mentions that it takes me an hour and a half to find the chapel, and also mentions that it was only three blocks away. I walk in on the dwarf treating the halfling group of adventurers. The got roughed up BAD by the kobolds, even one having to be revived. As he treats them, I talk to the ones who made it out more or less unscathed. I empathize with them and tell the DM that I'm going to repeat my advice from last time, with a few more tips and advice for buying equipment in town. They take me more seriously, but the DM notes that they leave with the heads slightly downcast. I ask if I can use bardic inspiration to encourage them. He agrees, and the leave with a new sense of purpose.\n\nWe are told that night is rapidly approaching. Rogue goes and sleeps on a roof, and Honnor gets a free night at the chapel. I head to a hotel/motel/tavern whatever and spend the night, getting a free breakfast in the deal and using my social skills to find out a bit more about the next floor. \n\n----\n\nThus ends the first session. Personally, I really hope we run into those halflings again (Knowing our DM, they'll pop up later and help us somehow, being more experienced and better prepared). \n\nSince I'm still new to D&amp;D, please feel free to mention if we did anything wrong in our playthrough. I'm still curious is proficiency with a banjo works that way LOL\n\n",

        "text": "H1Z1 is an upcoming zombie MMO from Sony. It's just gone on paid early release and will eventually be free to play. It's come in for a storm of criticism for introducing pay to win airdrops, after repeatedly announcing micro-transactions would be for cosmetic items only. Anyway, ignoring all that, here's a pretty cool story from launch day.\n\n____\n\nSource: http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2spuls/the_most_amazing_thing_just_happened/\n\n____\n\nI have been playing games for 2 decades. By far, the coolest thing that I have ever experienced in any game happened here.\n\nThis game has so much potential and will be the best zombie game ever.\n\nThis happened in a span of 3 minutes but felt like eternity - and I was truly scared:\n\nSo I'm in a yellow mansion with my friend; I've been playing for 4 hours straight - looting homes, scavenging, discovering recipes, etc. I'm on a server that doesn't save anything, and if you die, you start from scratch. So I began to have an emotional connection to my items; using stuff sparingly, and not taking risks like approaching people I don't know - staying hidden. It felt truly surreal.\n\nAnyway, In this yellow mansion with a buddy of mine, and the next thing we know we hear footsteps nearby. We're scared, because we don't know if they're zombies or people, and we have so much loot on us. Losing it all would be disastrous. So my friend and I ensure all the doors are closed, and inspect the front yard leading to a bunch of woods from a window in the living room. My friend calls out through voice chat, \"Hello!? Go Away, We're Armed!\"\n\nAfter a moment of silence, we're still staring out the window into the woods. Now we hear more foot steps. This is where my heart starts beating. I'm telling my friend, \"Oh shit man, there's more. Fuck dude, what are we going to do?\"\n\nHe looks at me and says, \"Get ba-\" and mid sentence, what I can only describe to you as a Hail Storm of bullets from the leaves and the woods, start piercing the glass and into the home. \"Fuck!! Cover!\", he yells.\n\n\"Out back! Out Back!\" he stammers as bullets are literally ripping through the window where we once stood. We get out back and he's now firing from the backyard of the house to the front yard into the trees, with each crack of bullets stinging the air and sending me into a panic. From the side of the house, I felt helpless watching my friend exchange fire with these guys - I just froze. Peaking, I spot 4 guys emerge from the trees with AR-15's and 1 shotgun just ripping into my buddy as he's still trying to protect me. He hits the ground, and I run back into the house - Scared. As. Fuck.\n\nI had developed a strong attachment to this guy, we ran in to each other in passing, and he offered me a bottled water, taught me how to craft things - a sense of loss came over me. But I couldn't think about him anymore, the only thing on my mind was survival. \"No, please! Don't shoot!\" I desperately yell through my mic for mercy. But there was no response. I heard the foot steps getting closer, and then later I hear them searching Room. to. Room. Like cold, dark assassins. I'm upstairs crouched behind a door at the far end of the hall, my heart pounding out of my chest. I hear footsteps finally stop at the door for 5 seconds without a sound, just the light pattering of rain that surrounded us. And it opens. The guy looks right at me with his shotgun in hand.\n\nWas fucking insane - I shit you not, my hands are up with the F2 key, \"Don't Shoot!\"; I can hear his friends calling from outside, \"IS HE IN THERE?!\" He's still looking at me. And I'm frozen just staring. Quiet. He turns around closes the door behind him, \"Nah, he ran away.\"\n\nBEST FUCKING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.\n\ntl;dr Meet stranger. Develop strong attachment. Stranger becomes best friend. Find home to settle in. Coordinated home invasion that leads to sadness and cries for mercy.\n",

        "text": "Yesterday, my brother and I played LittleBigPlanet 2 diving into other people's pods (home base, basically) and whatnot, when we found what looked like a five year old girl in her pod. We were looking around all happy-like and another guy decided to join. This guy came in wiggling around his arms, hugging people, and all that nice stuff. My brother was talking to him because why not. Then the little girl made a little tiny wafer house.\n\nThe wafer house was not elaborate at all. 3 walls made of wafers. That was it. We basically played house for two hours. The little girl didn't seem to know how to text chat, so we sorta had to guess what she wanted us to do. We picked up on little things like her knocking on the door, then I had to let her in and show her around. She'd drag someone out, quickly run in, then the person dragged out had to knock on the door. Eventually, she switched it up. She placed green slime all over the floor, so this time when we answered the door for her, she would come in all disgusted at the floor. She went outside and changed into a maid outfit. I had already made a sackboy with a broomstick, so we cleaned up disgusted at the floor. When we finished we all did a little victory dance. We were happy together.\n\nEverything went downhill after that. She didn't smile as much and was beginning to look sad every now and again. Eventually, she changed into other clothes and waved goodbye with a sad face. My sackboy was defeated. After all I had done for you, this is how you repay me? He was looking at the floor, crying. He went outside with the teenager guy and started hugging him. I went out and saw them together, then proceeded to run quickly into my house and cry some more. It was at that point our internet disconnected. It was the most abrupt and sad way to end our little sackboy adventures together. MR_MADDNESS, if your out there, you can keep that girl. I don't need her anymore. She's a skank and will leave you for another man as soon as she gets bored of you. I regret spending so much time with her. I hope she rots in hell.\n\n(jk i dont yall guys coo.)",

        "text": "[More tales from that decidedly weird time that I DM'ed a game!](http://redd.it/2rxzcc) For those of you who weren't here last time, [the party (consisting of Rose the Dullahan ranger and her stolen cat, Pratena the voracious cyclops murderchild, and Fishnaut the wannabe-astronaut sorcerer)](http://imgur.com/a/kBl11) had just finished a mission that went south when their fourth member, Sleazeball, turned out to be so much of an asshole that the party had to kill him. Technically, it was their job to do so- the organization they work for, called Asshole Patrol, has very specific rules about what to do with such people.\n\nThe party honored their lost comrade's memory by taking his share of the cash from the job.\n\nThings were a bit busier back at the base on their return, though. The place had been outfitted with tons of ambient light, apparently installed by the two architects that were hanging around- a surly dwarf and a large man with rivets under his skin. A titan.\n\nRose went ballistic, and peppered them both with questions about metalwork and gizmos. Pratena made soulful eyes at the huge man who could move houses without apparent effort, and Fishnaut collapsed into a corner to dream about space.\n\nThe next day, there was a new task for the party- and a new member! The naga-woman acting as mission coordinator introduced the party to Barrel, their new fourth member. He was a halfling rogue who wore nothing but a tricked-out barrel, and was understandably paranoid after his previous team had been stabbed to death by a group of unicorns. The team, short on subtlety and ranged firepower, welcomed him with open arms.\n\nTheir next mission, the party decided, was to investigate a town that was acting decidedly weird. They didn't have a lot of information on what was happening, but the general consensus was that if the town was weird then something sinister was going on and there was probably an asshole around to stick a sword in. With that, the party loaded up and set off for adventure!\n\nThe town they arrived in was a mostly elf village. Elves in my world have a tendency towards melancholy and very polite xenophobia, but this was a different beast. The townspeople all seemed to be in the throes of manic depression or substance abuse, or both. The bar was absolutely full, everyone they tried to ask questions to was prone to collapsing on the spot or bursting into tears, and there was very definitely something that nobody was telling the party.\n\nPratena and Rose put on their INVESTIGATOR HATS while Barrel went incognito, taking advantage of the town's lack of observational skills to plant himself in the town square, disguised as nothing more than an ordinary barrel. Nobody questioned this. Fishnaut, meanwhile, dropped by the local alchemist's shop to pawn a few items, identify a few items, and purchase a few minor magical artifacts.\n\nSuspicious things cropped up everywhere. The alchemist was drunk on pure alcohol and rambling something about how he sold a lot of alchemist's fire while not-subtly suggesting that Fishnaut should run screaming while he still could. Rose and Pratena tried to squeeze information out of the townsfolk, but all they got were vague warnings and a distinct feeling of unease. Barrel noticed that whatever was making all the townspeople so down, it apparently wasn't affecting the town guard...\n\nRose and Fishnaut confronted the town mayor in her longhouse. She was cheerful and a bit clueless, but seemed nice enough. She was genuinely concerned for her town, and was convinced that the recent melancholy was a result of some freak fires that had claimed a few houses. She blamed it on the dry season.\n\nPratena, meanwhile, had met the captian of the town guard- a cheerful, sociable man with a keen eye. He welcomed the visitng party with open arms, pointed out several good stores, and a place to stay the night. When Rose joined to ask him about the weird state of the townsfolk, he went off about how all the rainy weather had been getting everyone down.\n\nHm. Didn't the mayor say that they were having a dry season?\n\nSuspicions were mounting. The party knew that SOMETHING was up, but not quite what. They decided that they would spend the night camped out on a side-street, watching for SUSPICIOUS ACTS. The party was exceedingly bad at this, except for Barrel, who hadn't moved since they arrived.\n\nBarrel caught sight of a couple of town guard marching purposefully towards the alchemist's shop, taking some back roads. He carefully followed, watched as they entered the building, and listened as they started pouring some sort of liquid everywhere. This could not be good. He fetched the rest of the party just as the alchemist's shop started to smoke.\n\nThe two guards were at the building doors, very specifically holding it closed while someone else tried to hammer their way out. Pratena decided she would not stand for this, vaulted off of Barrel, crashed through a convenient window, and forced the door open by way of being absurdly strong. The alchemist, who had been trapped inside, immediately fled into the night while the rest of the party geared up for combat.\n\nLong story short, Fishnaut ran over things with a runaway horse cart (again), Rose smashed a few people with her sheild, Pratena ate a few dudes, and Barrel went mission impossible on a guy and decapitated him with a spinning corkscrew dive and an outstretched kukri. With that, they tossed the bodies into the still-burning alchemist's shop and called it a night.\n\nOr they would have, except they ran into two more guards approaching a house and meaningfully holding a torch.\n\nThese guys were lucky- they were so heavily outclassed that the party just beat them into unconsciousness instead of flat-out killing them. Then the party started asking \"pointed\" questions (the points being Barrel's knife, Rose's spear, and Pratena's piercing, hungry gaze) about what the hell was going on in this town. The guards started babbling about how it wasn't their idea, they were victims too, and please don't kill me oh god keep that girl away from me.\n\nWhen they eventually stopped pissing themselves in fear, they told the brief but damning tale of the captain of the guard, and how he'd been keeping the townsfolk in check with pinpoint arsonry while having his way with the nicer-looking women. That explained pretty much everything- the depression, the substance abuse, and how nobody wanted to talk about it. The party had found their asshole, and now they just needed to kill him.\n\nThe captive guards voiced very strong objections to just storming the guardhouse, as the captain was apparently a very paranoid man and would definitely be ready for trouble. So instead, the party backed off for a while, leaving Barrel in the town square again so that he could keep an eye on things. In the morning, the townsfolk were incredibly surprised to find more than half the guard were missing or dead, and the remainder had an increasingly shaky grip on the town.\n\nThings didn't get to the point of revolution, though- the first guy to speak out was taken down by a well-placed arrow from the guardhouse. The mayor demanded to know what was happening, and one of the remaining guards put the blame on \"that damned group of adventurers that's been snooping around\". So, when nobody was looking, Barrel shot that guard in the neck with an arrow.\n\nThe rest of the party decided that if they were going to move, they should do it soon. Fishnaut decided that a good course of action was to march DIRECTLY INTO TOWN SQUARE, UNDISGUISED, AND VISIT THE MAYOR. (this is the part where I start scrabbling through my notes and cursing)\n\nFishnaut's chat went exceedingly poorly due to a botched diplomacy roll, but he was a resiliant bugger and decided that the next course of action was obvious- climb inside Rose, and TRY AGAIN. He once again marched DIRECTLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN SQUARE, and started making a rousing speech about how the captain of the guard was a massive jackass and everyone knew it.\n\nBarrel, who was the only one with eyes on the situation, noticed a figure skulking in a nearby bush and pointed Pratena to it. She leapt, grabbing someone. She dragged them out.\n\nIt was the captain.\n\nThe entire town rushed over and promptly kicked him into a coma, releasing months of frustration in the form of a rain of boots to the groin. The captain had a lot of tricks up his sleeve, but nothing that could save him from this. He went down, was promptly cocooned in about a mile of sturdy chain, and was hung from a nearby tree to slowly starve.\n\nWith that, the party went through the usual series of events- they got thanked by the rather shellshocked mayor, chased away the remaining guards, and called dibs on the bad guy's stuff. Then they marched home, heads held high and loot-bags held low, content that they had done good in the world.\n\nOh, and Pratena got bored on the way home and got into a fistfight with a dozen wolves at once. She ate well that night.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Mob Justice\", SPRUCING UP THE OLD HOMESTEAD AND OOH, SHINY!](http://redd.it/2t3u1o)",

While in the mayor's office we were given the quest to look into some strange goings on in the city,which we gidily accepted. We start a patrol at night time and come upon a street fight between an orc and a halfling,i was the only one to think to not use deadly force and hadn't had the foresight enough to tell our tank not to swing her warhammer with enough force to squash the  halfling in one swoop,while it was night the streets were far from empty,causing a bit of a scene with multiple gaurd and civilian casualties when the tank refused to calm the fuck down and stop wildly swinging at people until the noise stopped.Though when we had finally stopped her rampage there were people to be saved so i jumped in as the healer and helped those i could survive and not remember exactly what happened.  More gaurds came to this scene,rightfully suspicious of the half giant with brain chunks still on her hammer. I remembered we had a party member who was with us despite not actually playing.  We decided he was just sleepy that day and carried him around with us. I had to give him a story to come back to so i just started babbling about how a mad man with the same description as our unconscious fellow had come in and started blowing people away with magic. I criticaled on my charisma check and ended up throwing him under the bus for the piles of dead bodies around us. Sadly we had to end our sessions due to distance issues.",

This story, along with the Tale of Old Man Henderson and some others figured prominently in my recent acquisition of the CoC rulebook, definitely for all the wrong reasons. \n\nI'll try to remember it in full. It's a worst experience, so it fits in here.\n\nA friend of mine, one of my regular players, borrowed my Call of Cthulhu material and decided he was going to run a game at the gaming society we both attend. This was a bad idea for a couple of reasons, the first being that it's hard to do evocative horror when you have a busy, happy background going on around you (unless you're specifically playing up the social alienation angle). The second, and more important, reason it was a bad idea was because he invited Donnie to play.\n\nDonnie is a good guy. I ran a Blue Rose campaign, he played in it, and it was great fun for all involved. However, Donnie is not a subtle guy, and he's not the sort of guy who can experience horror or exercise fearful judgement when it's required. As evidence toward this, when the group was rolling up reasonable, urbane, ordinary Call of Cthulhu characters, he decided to make a doctor.\n\nWith maximum ranks in the \"headbutt\" skill. More points in \"headbutt\" than he had in \"medicine\", and his character was a doctor. My friend convinced him to at least make his \"medicine\" skill equal to \"headbutt\", and the game proceeded on track.\n\nYou know the old saying, \"Give a man a hammer, and everything looks like a nail?\" Well, when you turn a man into a hammer, the same thing is true. Donnie tried to headbutt everything even vaguely problematic. It started with a door that wouldn't open, escalated to an ATM (which he scored a critical success against, and landed some free cash) and climaxed with him headbutting a skeleton after stumbling out-\n\nLet's wind it back a bit. During the course of the adventure, when they started encountering horrific skeletons that stalked their every move during the night, the party decided to tool up on weaponry. They visited a mall, broke in, and decided to ransack some of the shops to acquire weapons. Someone got a fire axe from a hardware store. Most got guns from a gun store. Donnie, since he liked fireworks, decided to drive to the local mining supply depot while this was happening, and after headbutting his way into a badly locked supply shack he made off with a backpack full of dynamite.\n\nEventually they tracked the skeletons down to an old well in the back garden of a manor house, and after a bit of research discovered that it had a cursed stone in at the bottom. Being pro-active, Donnie suggested they lower him into the well with a flashlight and his dynamite, and he'd rig it to blow. It sounded plausible, so they lowered him down with the flashlight and a pistol, and waited until he was in place.\n\nMessing around in the thick mud at the bottom, his flashlight soon failed. Not alarmed, Donnie started feeling around to find the cursed stone, and was in the process of feeling its edges when the cursed blood he was sloshing around in began to form into yet more skeletons, as it was so dark down there it might as well be night. A skeleton grabbed the rope and pulled it down, and then began wrestling with him, dragging him into the mud.\n\nDonnie let out a shout. Up at the top of the well, the rest of the party thought he was asking for the dynamite, and tossed it down. Desperately, Donnie began to headbutt the dynamite, hoping to set it off before the skeleton flayed him alive. Cue the following exchange:\n\n\"He's taking a long time down there.\"\n\"Can you see what's going on?\"\n\"No, my flashlight isn't working.\"\n\"Give me those matches.\"\n\nThe player fumbled and dropped the match, and Donnie simultaneously landed a critical hit with his headbutt.\n\nA massive explosion blew the well to smithereens. Rolling on the resistance table, Donnie survived the initial explosion, was thrown several blocks away, and crashed into some lady's house, breaking his legs. Understandably panicked, the lady called an ambulance, and five minutes later it turned up. At this point Donnie regained consciousness, and rather than be taken to hospital, he held the ambulance crew up with his pistol and stole the ambulance.\n\nMeanwhile, a horrible, rapidly decaying, muddy skeleton made from blood and charred, broken stone clawed its way out of the well in the shadow of the (now wrecked) house and began to advance on the party. Cue a massive combat that grew rapidly more tense, until it was interrupted by the sound of...\n\nSirens? The ambulance crashed through the fence, ran over the skeleton and screeched to a halt. Donnie, his legs broken, staggered out of the ambulance and fell to the ground, right beside the pinned monster. It proceeded to try and grab him, and he responded the only way he knew how.\n\nWith a headbutt.\n\nEdit: and remember, it's Doctor McHeadbutt. He worked long and hard for that PhD in Aggressive Phrenology.",

        "text": "As Rob lay bleeding, his arm freshly torn away by the great black Wyrm's mighty talon, he spoke softly to the dead Wyrm, whose Acidic blood ate at the very earth itself.\n\n\"Farewell, old foe, until we meet again at days end.\"\n\nThe slow crackle and sizzle of the melting danced across his ears like strange, ethereal music. Looking to the bleeding stump that was once his arm, Rob laughed softly.\n\n\"I may join you yet, old foe.\" he said softly. He was cold, very cold, but the dawning sun warmed his face and exposed chest. He slipped quietly into sleep, the warmth faltered and Rob awoke unto a battlefield.\n\nHe stood at the center, surrounded by shadow-men clad in silver armor, they were glorious and terrifying in their figure, stout, and menacing. They marched forward singing a battle hymn, Rob knew the tune, but it had soured in death.\n\n\"On we march t'ward night's embrace,\nforth we march t'ward darkness' gates,\nthe wheel upon the golden field,\nwill drive them back, WE DO NOT YIELD.\"\n\nThe voices were of the men, but not of them, a ghostly chorus that filled his ears and burned his eyes with grief.\n\n\"I hear you.\" he yelled, screamed, begged, \"I see you!\"\n\nA roar, all too familiar echoed from the sky above, black wings across the red sky and ash, glimmering gold eyes stabbed at Rob. The Beast swept to and fro, diving, biting, thrashing and burning all in his path. The shadow men clashed with the Beast.\n\nIt was then that Rob saw the beast's men, scaled and tall, monstrous things with human form and dragon figure. They tore into the shadows, biting, slashing and reaving through the lines. But the shadows marched on, their song filled the air and for a moment Rob felt a glimmer of hope. But only just.\n\nRob looked to the beast again, it dove again and the song faltered.\n\nRob knew he must act. Calling upon the old words, he took up the Starlance. \"Brish da vom brouk\" and appeared above and ahead of the beast. The two golden eyes fixed in surprise upon the diminutive man. As he fell, Rob brought forth the lance, diving for the neck of the beast.\n\nGiganth had time only to roar in anger and surprise before the lance drove through his neck. He swatted vainly, his death decided, at his killer. A talon, long as Rob himself took Rob at the shoulder. Reaching out with his left, Rob grabbed onto the lance and then all became darkness.\n\nRob awoke with a fright. Looking around, he found himself in his bed. It had all been a dre... Looking to his arm, he saw the truth. He called out to his friends, shocked and in pain. Alex burst into the room, her Red hair dancing with every loping, graceful step.\n\n\"Calm yourself. I will fetch you medicine for the pain.\"\n\n\"My dream!\" he yelled to her.\n\n\"You are a hero, Robert, a stupid, irresponsible, reckless hero.\" she said.\n\nRobert did not respond, he could feel his arm, feel himself moving it, feel warmth on his fingers, feel the wind push against his skin, but it was gone, a phantom arm, a ghost.\n\nHe thought on that as he slipped again into restless sleep, and on the song, and the shadow men who marched, ever on, fighting a battle they could never win.",

        "text": "I recently reconnected with my old gaming group, whose outrageous level of inspired lunacy I remember fondly. I agreed to DM a campaign for them over video chat, as I live about a hundred miles from the rest of them. The subsequent descent into the rabbit hole hit me as soon as I heard the character concepts. All three of them are playing dwarves (this was agreed on beforehand), and the party roster is as follows:\n\n* Glorin Thunderbeard, ranger. Suffers from dragon-induced PTSD and plans on acquiring a hippogriff mount as soon as dwarvenly possible. Has a belt full of throwing hammers. \n* Jozen Firebeard, Skald and apprentice bagpipe maker. Plays the bagpipes he makes so poorly that his teammates are driven into a killing frenzy. Carries a barrel of ale strapped to his back. \n* Barazûn, son of Barazinbar, cleric of Hanseath (dwarven god of revelry and berserking). Carries a “holy tankard” with him at all times, his holy symbol/improvised weapon of choice. Also wears a Dwarven boulder helmet at all times.\n\nThese three are all, apparently, constantly drunk. With my best poker face I made the mental adjustments necessary to run a campaign as ridiculous as I believe this will be, and we opened on our first session.\n\nSession One: Alcoholics make terrible miners\n\nThe setting: Urnak, a continent that greatly resembles the less desirable real estate from a Mad Max film. Think Fantasy New Mexico, rolling badlands for thousands of miles, punctuated sharply by stone plateaus that jut out of the wastes every so often. These plateaus are home to the cities of Dwarves and hobgoblins, and the wastes between are filled with scavenger hordes of orcs. Our drunken protagonists live in one of the smaller dwarven towns, Azamek. \n\nThe day begins with the mining shifts every dwarf is required to fulfill, expanding the tunnels for more living space. Moram Halfspear, foreman of the mining crew, informs his charges that the surveyors have discovered a natural cavern close to the current tunnel. If they can reach it, the shift will finish early and everyone can fuck off to the tavern. Jozen the skald decides to liven up the work crew a bit, and begins his raging song. This affects everyone in earshot, and the mining operation kicks into overdrive, dozens of raging dwarves swinging picks with all their might in some medieval adaptation of [the Legend of John Henry's Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI0D44zYP-Q). \n\nThe singing is so loud, the work crew so enthusiastic, that no one notices the rumbling beneath their feet until it's too late. A split second before disaster strikes,  Barazûn the cleric snaps out of his work zone, realizes what's coming, and whispers a prayer as the floor gives out under the guys in front. \n\nJozen wakes up first, finding himself in what he assumes is that natural cavern the foreman was talking about. He sees his drinking buddies, along with another dwarf whose name he thinks is Durgen, half buried under fallen stone. The roof of the cavern is about thirty feet above them, the collapsed tunnel section plainly visible, and obviously blocked. It might take help a long time to come. The cavern stretches out in front of them, past the range of their darkvision. Our heroes do the sensible thing, and immediately start bickering.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Barazun thinks he hears voices approaching out in the darkness, and shouts a hearty \"Who goes there? We need help over here!\" At which point the voices abruptly stop.\n\nThe dwarves take stock. The four of them are largely unarmed, and uniformly unarmored, having understandably not expected to find themselves in battle on a work crew. They have their picks, Barazun has his helmet and Holy Tankard, and Glorin has a pair of his throwing hammers tucked in his belt. Not ideal conditions. But these are dwarves, and they'll be damned if they'll just sit there. Hoisting their picks, they get ready for whatever might be coming, straining their eyes to survey the cavern.\n\nThey'd have been better off listening. A dwarf appears out of thin air, warhammer in hand, and only narrowly misses the startled Glorin. Durgen isn't so lucky, as another previously invisible dwarf materializes and scores a direct hit on his back. The fight is on.\n\nBarazun running tackles the dwarf that's just struck Durgen, Glorin smashes his pick into his attacker's face, and Jozen begins belting out the ancestral Dwarven battle hymn describing how they intend to \"Rock You,\" inspiring murderous rage in his comrades.\n\nThe fight is fast, brutal, and ugly. Jozen, while he's standing in the middle of the skirmish singing, recalls the stories he's heard of Duergar, the dark cousins of Dwarf kind. As he's about to pause in his song to explain this to Barazun and Glorin, a third dark dwarf appears from the dark, points at Glorin, and Commands him to \"Drop.\"\n\nGlorin does, and his opponent brings his Warhammer down on his suddenly prone foe, luckily only grazing the ranger. The second duergar gets a lucky hit on Barazun, but Durgen manages to catch him with his pick and he drops. Barazun, still enraged, charges the spellcaster headfirst, smashing into him and carrying him backwards. Glorin tries to fend off his attacker, but prone as he is he can't make his blow connect. Jozen charges to his aid, but also can't manage to hit the duergar before it delivers a blow with the warhammer that renders Glorin unconscious.\n\nThe spellcaster, visibly wounded, steps back and throws a Burning Hands spell at Barazun, the fire leaving the cleric staggered. With a last surge of rage, Barazun headbutts the duergar, and they both pass out.\n\nThe last duergar is still dancing around Glorin and Jozen, until Durgen in desperation throws his pick thirty feet, managing to bury it the duergar's face. The fight is over, for the moment, but half the party, most notably the cleric, is wounded and out of commission.\n\nWorking over the duergar in search of valuables, Jozen comes across a scroll of healing, which he uses to restore some of the cleric's vigor. Revitalized, Barazun channels all of his available healing energy into getting his companions back to fighting shape, and they take up the duergars' armor and weapons.\nThey now have warhammers, chain shirts, and poorly built crossbows. Better than nothing. Emboldened by their newly acquired armory, the dwarves set off deeper into the cavern (after a brief discussion on how long it is acceptable to be trapped in a cave before eating fallen Duergar to survive - the consensus is \"longer than ten minutes Jozen, come on.\")\n\nProceeding onward, the dwarves find that the natural cavern narrows into a worked stone tunnel. The walls are adorned with obscene Duergar graffiti, and several broken picks litter the passageway. Barazun makes some passing remarks about poorly disciplined miners, which elicits a round of silent staring from his companions.\n\nAfter a half hour of walking, the tunnel opens out again into a vast chamber, massive stone columns supporting a roof that lies beyond the reach of their darkvision. Between two of the columns stretches a barricade of moldering junk, from behind which can be heard an awful, droning chant in a language they don't quite understand. Our heroes attempt to sneak closer.\n\nThe ensuing clatter as Jozen and Barazun, unused to their new armor, collide loudly and begin angrily blaming one another for the misstep, is answered by a chorus of angry shouts from behind the barricade. Glorin and Durgen get their crossbows out, and put two bolts in the first Duergar to pop his head over the wall of rubbish. Barazun casts his last spell and doubles in size as Jozen once again starts to sing loudly. \n\nThe now ten foot Barazun charges directly into the barricade, hammer swinging. He hits with enough force to obliterate a wide stretch of the rubbish wall, sending junk and scrap flying in all directions, and revealing another four Duergar...who have also enlarged themselves. He remembers too late that this is the Duergar's other favorite party trick, as the giant dark dwarves all rush him at once. \n\nBarazun goes down, Glorin and Durgen open fire on the Duergar, and Jozen keeps singing. The farthest dark dwarf from the party summons a large balck and red rat that smells of sulfur, and ducks out of the line of crossbow fire. The massive duergar take up positions behind the cover of the barricade, and return fire with their own crossbows, effectively turning the cavern into the OK Corral. Crossbow bolts are flying everywhere, and Jozen runs through the war zone to smash the fiendish rat that's getting ready to finish off Barazun. \n\nThe Duergar cleric appears on the far end of the barricade, drops a Doom curse on Jozen, and gets winged by one of Durgen's bolts. He puts Jozen between himself and the other dwarves, and Glorin gets a lucky hit on one of the duergar shooters, putting a bolt through his eye and dropping him cold. Jozen hits the cleric with his warhammer, but the cleric retaliates with a negative energy burst that nearly takes the skald out of the fight. Durgen manages to drop another one of the shooters, and Glorin takes out the last one. \n\nNow it's just the duergar cleric facing off against three pissed of dwarves: that doesn't last long. Between crossbow bolts and hammer blows, the priest drops, and the dwarves breath a sigh of relief. Jozen finds a scrap of parchment written in an unknown language in the cleric's tent, Glorin manages to bring Barazun around, and together they trek back to the original cave in site to get some rest before exploring any further. \n\nThe dwarves catch some sleep, and awake to a light shining down from above. Help has arrived, in the form of Moram Halfspear, the verbally abusive foreman. \n\nA few minutes later, in Moram's office, they tell the surly foreman their story. He's understandably impressed that four practically unarmed idiots managed to kill seven fully geared up duergar soldiers, and deciphers the note Jozen found, which turns out to be tunneling directions toward their town from deep in the Underdark. \n\nAnd then he offers them jobs, as recruit Deepwardens; the front line defenders that keep dwarven society safe from the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the world. The four of them are disinclined...until Moram tells them that they'd be pulled from mining duty for Deepwarden training. Suddenly they can't enlist fast enough. \n\nAnd so our heroes join the army to get out of doing work. Next session, they'll meet the rest of the new recruits, and find out just how far in over their heads they really are. ",

        "text": "To start off i'll talk abit about our campaign in general and the character og Butch. (also english is not my primary language, so my punctuation is horrible)\n\nSo were playing a campaign with switching gm, Butch has s far survived 3 sessions, withou taking too much damage (also kicking a trolls ass single handedly while enlarged). The part consist of Butch a chaotic neutral brawler, a neutral evil sorcorer whose greatest desire is to be a king. A lawful good dwarf with a knack for armor. And a chaotic good elf ranger, who only rolls well when the rest of the party is about to die.\n\nButch is a level 4 brawler, he is a former street fighter, and grew up on the streets. he is a 6.7 f. monster of a human with a score of 20 strength and otherwise fairly average stats. He allways want to prove he is the beast, and gets angry quite easily.\n\nAnyway so we're sent to this ghost town to investigate what is happening. The town is more or less abandoned, and were just casually riding in. Nothing happens for some time, making Buth a little bit restless. We reach a house with smoke coming out the chinmey. We ride closer to chack what is going on, this is where it starts going downhill for Butch.\n\nThe house is covered in some sort of runes, our sorcerer rolls a knowledge arcana to see what the runes mean, and rolls a 1. Critical fail here then leads to misinformation. So he tells the party the runes are used to summon undead. Butch gets off his horse, and goes to kick in the door, rolls really well and the door basicly explodes as his boot hits it. he yells \"I am Butch the Magnificent, and i challenge you all to combat, come out and fight like real men and let me show you how it's done\" an old man comes stumbling out scared shitless, surprised something living has shown up, and starts explaining the situation, that the runes outside is for protection against undead (i dont remember this conversation to well, so its just the overall idea here) he leads us towards the church in the center of the town, and were off. After Butch tried to fix the pieces of the door with a tanglefoot bag.\n\nWe ride towards the church and all do a perception roll, butch rolls one, misinformation time! he thinks he sees movement in an alley, and he just bolts there since he i getting quite eager for a fight.\n\nThe rest of the party notices the skeletons comming at them. as butch keeps failing perception checks to hear his party mates, he misses out on the fighting. This of course makes him quite displeased to say the least.\n\nWe get to the church where he destroys another door, and calls out his enemies. Again nothing happens. He hurls a church bench in frustration, and still nothing happens. The party tells him there is a door and then simply moves out of the way of this hulking beast of a man.\n\nThe door ceases to exist and he walks down the hallway, this time failing a reflex sav, and falling down a traphole. taking 2d6  damage. Our gm let me roll it myself. the results 6 and 5. So im down to 24 hp and getting angrier by the second. (off game were all laughing quite a bit at his misfortune) so now he is stuck in a dark corridor alone and starts exploring with his torch while the party climbs down (no butch is not a smart man).\n\n2 different traps later (me rolling the highest number on the damage every time) im down to about 18-21 health. The party now right behind me as we are opening a door, we encounter 3 ghouls, and the corridor is only wide enough for one. The ghouls get infront of the door since they won innitiative, and butch is forced to try and bullrush them. He only moves it 5 feet, so he is now surrounded by 3 ghouls, 8 damage later we have dispatched the ghouls, the ret of the party only suffering minor injuries.\n\nSo we continue since Butch is too proud to retreat they go through next door, we kill an ooze of somekind and Butch is at 8 now. someone tosses him a cure potion with heal 2d6. i roll 1 and 1. (off game this is getting funnier by the second) So our dwarf charges through the next door, and since butch needs to prove he is the best, he follows close after, not wanting to be outdone by a sissy dwarf. Queue the skeleton mage and archers. Butch gets hit by a spell, drops to 4, i off game think i get the brilliant idea of having the sorcorer enlarge me, then charging the mage. I miss my attack, and he instantly incinerates my, dropping me to minus a lot.\n\nSo a lot of bad rolls (and decisions) from butch killed him horribly. He was insanely fun to play untill the end. Now i shall play a half-orc warpriest of gorum indtead. I figured we needed a healer ;)",

They started in Jail and each had to describe why they were there , we had illegal immigration, accidental public indecency (It is hard to keep a loincloth in place apparently), Tax evasion, and accidental incest... a goldmine for future plot lines to say the least. Fast forward and they've been sent as a suicide squad to investigate what's happening with the dwarves nearby. Queue combat which opens with the paladin throwing a longsword across the room and rolling a 20 to hit, so the blade lodged in the kobold's shoulder, The wizard decided he would try to play tank and ran in with a staff (wasn't happy with the lack of damage he could do, then was reminded about being a wizard with spells) Later the cleric decides he should throw his mace, rolls a 1, throwing his mace backwards into the wizard who had decided to stop playing a tank and start throwing magic missiles everywhere. Then someone decided the easiest way to the sling wielding kobold was to run along the wall, he rolled a 2 so that didn't pan out, their eyes now open to the possibilities of tabletop everybody decided parkor was cool and tried to do it themselves, they were all clad in Armour except the wizard and all had pretty horrible acrobatics modifiers so everybody except the warlock ended up prone on the ground. I think they enjoyed the ability to try anything they could think of.  \n\nEdit: I forgot to Mention that the session ended with throwing the gnome cleric into the next room to see draw whatever's hiding in there out.",

        "text": "There is a a reason I'm not allowed to play a certain character anymore. A few years back I created a mage with one particular set of skills. He could light things on fire. And he was damned good at it. I was a pyromage, around level eight or so, and my adventuring companions and I had already had a few mishaps because of my characters overwhelming desire to burn everything he saw. Be it a farm house we intended to sleep in, the ship we were still voyaging on, or the tavern where we started a brawl, nothing survived me.\n\nI was journeying with a motley group. A shifty half-orc that seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with the dead, an idiot dwarf who fancied himself a problem solver, a disgraced paladin who slaughter an innocent family because he was sure they were in line with some bandits... and me the pyromage.\n\nWe had just spent a few month aboard a ship, (before I accidentally burned it down to kill some pirates) and I spent the voyage crafting as many exploding runes as my spells per day could handle. I had somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred packed away by the end. I didn't have any plan for them, but anything that explodes on sight seemed like a grand idea at the time.\n\nWe arrived in port around mid day, and much to my parties displeasure, we found ourselves on the receiving end of an orc with a magical battleaxe that cut through armor like dry leaves. Our dwarf companion learned that the hard way when he took a blow to his face.\n\nBut Mr. Battleaxe had never met me. Unfortunately I destroyed most of the shipyard as well.  As for my dwarven friend the town had a cleric up to snuff and we pulled back his immortal soul into the still bleeding husk of his body, and we were able to continue our adventure. At this point the town was a tad miffed, though I couldn't imagine why. So I burned down a few ships, I killed the pirates! They were better off for it. They didn't see it that way.\n\nSo they gave us a choice. Pay for the ships, the labor, and all the other fees that went into construction, or go kill the litch that had been plaguing their town. Wo Ho! Well what would a band of adventures be without some baddie to kill and loot. We set off immediately for his lair.\n\nIt wasn't hard to find the litch, nor his undead minions. We easily dispatched most of his lesser flock, and eventually came to the undead bastard himself. Now on the day of the fight, our dwarven companion was bogged down with his real life affairs, and his character was under the control of the DM. He was a straight forward enough guy, so it wasn't hard to guess how he would react. Run forward, swing weapon, repeat.\n\nAnd that's what he did. All three of my friends ran at the litch and his two summons and proceded to hit it with sharp blades until one of them broke. I on the other hand, was at a loss. I had all manner of pyrotechnic spells ready and burning in my chest for release, but my damned cohorts kept getting in the way. I was so busy dodging them and the litch's bitches that I could not find a clean shot.\n\nWell I still had a pocket full of explosive ruins, and a cantrip I memorized in hopes of annoying the dwarf. So when it came for my turn I pulled them out and mage handed them to where i thought they would do the most good. Now reading is a free action, so once I mage handed them over my elven eyes did the work. I jabbed my finger onto the grid square I knew would be the most beneficial and declared my intent.\n\nThe DM got a strange look on his face, more out of annoyance for my having solved the riddle than anything else. Or so I thought, and he asked me if I was sure. I quoted the rules just to make sure, and his grin got a little wider. Oh yeah, I'm sure.\n\nTurns out explosive runes are a lot stronger than I thought. All of my party failed their saving throws, and one by one the dice fell, and the damage tacked on. The paladin fell, unconcious in the dirt. Our only healer. The half-orc next. Dead. Then the dwarf. Dead as dead could be. My friends stared at me with murder in their eyes, and my DM laughed so hard he fell over.\n\n\"But wait!\" I cried, \"What about devine intervention?\" The dwarf was a pious sort, always talking to his forge god and whatnot. Sure, it's a long shot, but he wasn't there to ask.\n\nThe dice came up 99. That bastard did it, he survived on a roll he had no part in, Well I couldn't let that be in vein.\n\nWe had been using house rules, so Haste was still overpowered and dumb, letting me cast two spells per turn. I somehow survived the first swing by the litch, my magic keeping me standing. I had my chance. I used a mist spell to get out of range, a flight spell to ride the winds, and I let loose with every fire spell I could think of. Brimstone and death rained down on the litch as if I were a volcano turned man.\n\nHe burned like a pretty little torch.\n\nOut of spells, out of enemies, I dropped back to the earth and looked over the carnage. One friend lay dead, another two bleeding out. I loaded their limp forms into the cart and dragged them back to town.\n\nIf you can beleive it, they were furious! But I defeated the litch! I told them, I got us all this loot. But they couldn't see the forest for the trees. Or rather, the forestfire. Reckless, they called me. Thoughtless. In the real world they threw emptied coke cans and told me I was an idiot.\n\nNext week I couldn't make it to the game. They used my character as a battering ram against a fortress. Or rather, they covered the door with the remaining explosive ruins and had him stand just a little too close. Even with my fire resistance 90 some odd explosions was too much.\n\nThey handed my a blank character sheet next session.  RIP Scorchy, who will sleep in the camp fires now? ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2s9k6i/xpost_from_rrpg_against_all_odds_a_story_about/",
        "text": "I’m the DM/GM of a group of players who meet online, usually weekly, who have an uncanny knack of absolutely crushing the scenarios I put them against all odds. I’m not looking for advice on how to murder them, I just want to give you a glimpse into how they play and through meticulous planning, thinking outside of the box, and a little bit of luck have been put to the test time and time again by being placed in absolutely unfair and scenarios and still winning.\n\nLet’s first set up by talking a bit about my GM philosophy. The most important thing is that everyone has fun, and I try to design scenarios where everyone can take part and potential solutions could involve everyone. I always want everyone to feel like they are on the same level as the other players, yet I want players to make the characters they want to play with few restrictions within reason. For example, inn our Shadowrun game I have a character that comes from the Earthdawn setting (who was crystalized and then awoken by Aztechnology), and while this makes him vastly different from his compatriots he still had to make the same choices stat wise at character creations (which made him a pure Adept) and he had to take negative qualities in some of the hardest hitting ways in a cyberpunk game, the uneducated and incompetent ones dealing with using any technology. This gives him a unique character with a specific role and interesting story hooks, but keeps him balanced with the party. The goal is to make interesting characters to create interesting stories, not to make mathematically more proficient characters.\nIf you enjoy this story I’ll share a few from our Shadowrun games, but tonight’s story is about a D&amp;D 3.5/Pathfinder game set in a Forgotten Realms we’ve kind of tweaked. Names will be left out because some of them use them online. Our party includes a human Inquisitor, A drow Wizard (specialized in Conjuration), a Bard/Gunslinger (going for the Pirate specialization), an Orc fighter that they will come across with amnesia and very little equipment during the game, and a Fairy Psudodragon with a level in Druid and Sorcerer (who took all of the necessary level restrictions with picking the unique race). At character creation players roll the traditional 4d6 drop the lowest with a little extra thing to make everyone feel more unique where you pick one lower level wondrous item or magic item like a +1 weapon at the start. The players started these characters at level 3 and have worked their way to level 5 or its equivalent before the start of this game.\n\nNow like I said this group of players routinely beats any encounter set before them, which isn’t a bad thing. As we’ve played games over time I’ve stepped up the difficulty even across games to make them harder and harder and they do this through great planning and execution, and I take pride in the fact that this planning continues out of game for days at of time. I’ve caught the group scheming and talking about the game between games, planning for contingencies and building tools and backup plans anytime they can get together which makes me feel great as a GM because that means the games I send their way are engaging enough to talk about and plan for beyond just the day at the virtual table.\n\nWith our Pathfinder game I reached a point after a long break for the holidays to finally bite the bullet and send them something akin to a no-win scenario. Have them face a veritable army headed by an enemy that was many times outside of their power reach in a scenario where they would have overwhelming power and see if like a puzzle they could unlock a solution that grants them victory.\n\nSo to start off with we had several characters from Fearun and one from Kara-Tur (Shou Lung to be specific). Wanting to give my players freedom and a taste of something different I set the game in Zakhara, the Middle Eastern equivalent in the setting. Zakhara is also a pirate heavy setting with a lot of trade an shipping out of the silk road hubs which gave the players the ability to get a ship and go where they wanted to adventure on the world map and then I craft a scenario out of that region they traveled to. After a few adventures they chose to move to Harab, a larger island south of Zakhara proper where a continuous pirate war is being waged where various nations in Forgotten Realms sponsor pirate armies over control of this important port of call.\n\nTheir goal was a bit of piracy of their own, wanting a bigger better ship and eventually something they could turn into a Spelljammer. A bit about our tweaked setting before we move forward. To sidestep issues with continuity and allowing players to make big splashes in the world and to deal with the way IP owners have moved licensed worlds in directions we don’t like we have a tendency to move the timeline forward in any game world we play a bit and use the time in between to make the changes to the world we want in our game. In Forgotten Realms the development level is less Middle Ages and more Age of Exploration and they have “solved” the spellplague and fixed the continent shifting in the intervening years, at the cost of many of the primary movers and shakers ether to solving those events or simply old age. Their legacy remains however.\n\nOne of the consequences of this is that Spelljammers now have a tendency to show up in the Realms, and thus it’s becoming less Forgotten. This isn’t without consequence, as there are regions and magical anomalies still in effect that often run them aground and cause them to get stranded.\nThey wanted a bigger ship so I decided to give them a chance for exactly what they asked for. After a taste of piracy the party spots smoke signals in the distance from a wrecked vessel. Upon inspection they find a loan orc who’s lost his memory and most of his equipment, and as they come to him the desperately boarded up belly of the ship bursts open with hordes of undead. The entire crew had been turned and there are more than a dozen of them closing fast. The party beats a hasty retreat while they signal the Pirate to have their crew man the cannons and hit them with artillery at range, which deals with the problem at hand. Upon inspection of the wreck they find a bounty notice from the new Republic of Luskan to the Bregan D'aerth to hunt down and capture the Dread Ship and end its days turning the pirates around Harab and interfering with their own state sponsored privateering in the region to the tune of 50,000 GP. A hefty sum, but these were seasoned veterans and they just saw their fate so they needed to come up with a real plan, and to do that they needed to gather intelligence.\n\nSo they took to the local port and while they outfitted their new Orc compatriot the Pirate and the Fairy Dragon set out to see if they could find any info. They came across a group of three pirate captains, one from each major region, attempting to hammer out a hasty truce to deal with the Dread Ship. In a bold move the Pirate approaches them and tells them of the bounty, but bluffs and says it’s from Neverwinter. The ruse is to get these guys to do the work for them by softening up the ship before they swoop in seeing as they have but a small frigate and a light crew while these guys have full complements of galleons and multiple ships at which to throw at a greater enemy. One of the captains critically fails their check against the bluff and immediately buys it, pulling his pistol against the other captains and starting a firefight. The Pirate slipped away in the chaos and then followed the survivor to his ship where they prepared to hunt down and take the Dread Ship on their own.\n\nStaying out of their sights the party manages to find the other pirates locked in mortal combat with the Dread Ship, but it isn’t what they expected. The pirates are fielding to fully armed galleons with 20 guns each but are losing to the undead hoard in what may be the largest ship on the planet. The Dread Ship is over 225 ft wide and roughly 500ft long! But that’s not the worst of it. The entire massive multi-level ship fielded with massive siege weapons that require multiple groups of undead to arm is floating 50ft in the air! In comparison the galleons are only 50ft wide and 200ft long, and our party’s ship is half the size of them.\n\nThis leads into another problem. As the other pirates lose they simply feed the enemy with more undead, compounding their problems. They can’t win a toe to toe fight with ether of their two ships and they don’t stand a chance against the mighty Dread Ship, so they needed a plan and fast. I gave them a bit to think, muted the mic and handled some things while they pondered, and when I came back they had one, the riskiest most daring plan they’ve ever put to action.\n\nThe Conjurer and the Fairy Dragon cast Improved Invisibility on themselves and Levitate to not make a sound as they attempted to pass through the lower levels of the massive floating ship from the back. After finding a narrow passage they made their way through the hordes of hundreds of undead undetected, too occupied and not intelligent enough to spot them. They were looking for what was powering the ship but they had no luck, and eventually ventured topside to discover an ever crueler truth. The ship’s power was at the helm surrounded by an incorporeal ghost captain and a man with robes bending the wheel with his mind. Upon further inspection it turned out he was a Lich and in place of this massive Spelljammer’s power supply he put his own phylactery in there and was steering the ship with the power of his very soul!\n\nThe forces they faced besides this daunting duo were no slouch ether as most of the skeletons had four arms to bear the weight of the massive siege engines used for weaponry on the ship, some wielding pistols in each of their four hands. Now the moment of truth came, do they stick to the plan or do they run away. In spite all of the odds against them they stuck to the plan.\nThe Conjurer had chosen as his magical items at creation two immovable rods. He took them and gave them to the Fairy Dragon after narrowly succeeding a stealth check against the Lich with Life Sight. The Fairy Dragon had a high engineering check to find the weak points in the helm. Rolling exceptionally high he found them, stuck them in these weak points and clicked the button. All of the ships locked in combat were moving at combat speed which was bad for the Dread Ship as the rods ripped the helm from the stern removing the ships power source and causing the massive multi-ton ship crashing 50ft into the water. Hundreds of undead in the lower decks were crushed under the weight of collapsing tender and the waves nearly capsized the southern pirate ship though the northern one made an amazing save to keep the ship unharmed forcing the party’s ship to give chase and attempt to take it down themselves.\n\nThe fall damage did nothing to the ghost captain but the Lich sustained serious wounds as did most everything else on deck. It was at this point the Conjurer took close observation of the ghost pirate’s actions who was barking out orders in a non-common language. Having found the instructions of how Spelljammers work from the descendant of a Greyhawk stranded captain he rolled an excellent linguistics check to find that he was telling his undead crew to “resist.” Resist? Who the other pirates? They are killing them pretty swiftly so that can’t be it. That must mean that the crew is attempting to resist the Lich! The undead aren’t the enemy, just the Lich is!\nNow they face an even more impossible task. To emancipate the undead crew under the Lich’s control they have to go toe to toe with a Lich, something far out of reach for a normal level 5 party. But they prepared for this and this is not a normal level 5 party. While in port and at sea they crafted potions of entanglement with a water based primary component using the Inquisitor to create holy water and replacing this component. Thus they created holy grenade weapons that stuck enemies where they were and continued to burn them with holy blight until they could break free, and filled the cannons with projectiles with the same stuff to cover the decks with.\nNow the deck of the Dread Ship is far too large to cover, but upon realizing that the Lich is the true enemy the Conjurer instructs a bombing crew aboard a flying carpet to target him. The Inquisitor and the Orc Fighter strike true and do massive damage to the Lich and the Conjurer broke his phylactery, but he isn’t dead yet. Knowing that if the Lich acts the party will surely die the Fairy Dragon, tiny and weak as he is, desperately makes a shot with his sling that hits for nearly maximum damage, a paltry amount but it just enough so that in his next action he Lich succumbs to a round holy damage from the entanglement rolling exactly what they need to kill him. This set free the pirate ghost and his crew who aid in running through the enemy pirates on deck. The party’s Pirate closed with the northern galleon and scores a massive hit across the enemy deck covering it with goop and freezing the enemy in place long enough to negotiate their surrender.\n\nHaving set his crew free the ghost captain will now be allowed to pass to the other side after fulfilling one last request of the party who saved them by helping them pilot this massive vessel to Luskan for the reward. It turns out this used to be a Spelljammer for a group of giants who died in the crash leaving only the normal size crew who were enslaved by the Lich after succumbing to their wounds.The undead cannot pass on their own, but of their free will 20 of the four armed skeleton crew join the party under their command. The party earned enough experience to gain two levels and enough loot to buy nearly anything they will need for the next crazy adventure I come up with.\n\nThe party almost died several times, and had they rolled any lower they would have most certainly perished, but again they persevered against all odds.\n",

        "text": "Greetings! Long time lurker, first time poster\n\nalways been wanting to be in a long term group, but after a few years of many one session groups, i decided to make my own and make it run for as long as i could. heres how our first two sessions went...\n\nInvestigators: we have Rick Jameson, a texas cattle rancher out visiting to expand his ranch business, played by my friend 'Carl'\n\nBudley Matheson, AKA Bud, a photojournalist and information broker looking for the next big thing, also played by Carl... oops, spoilers :)\n\nJack Malone, an asian man raised by whites, he joined the Yakuza because of his smarts in books and money, also a martial artist, played by 'Jarod'\n\nSavvy Professor, a-well, professor, looking to expand her knowledge base to become more popular, also has a bit of a kelpto and drinking side, played by 'Amy'\n\nMarcus Mayhew, and ex navy marine who, after WW2, is looking to set the world right with his guns, played by 'Daniel'\n\nOK, heres the story...\n\nWe being in Salt Lake city, Utah, where thee of our group, Rick, Savvy and Marcus hear a scream in their motel room. after getting up and investigating the yell, they find a \nman dead with blood everywhere in his room. after a quick call to the cops, they are met by a man from the Secret Service, who asks them to help in his investigation since he \nhasnt found anything in his two weeks of investigating. they agree, if they receive monetary compensation (of course).\nSo they travel to the morgue to examine the other body, where they learn the two deaths are connected, by either blood or marriage (they didn't roll high enough to determine \nhow) so this beings to look like a revenge killing. they relax a bit thinking this isnt a cult behind the killings (how naive they were) and decide more information is \nneeded.\n\nupon returning to the original crime scene to compare notes, the lead investigator has disappeared, but his partner is there to talk to and gather their information. he says \nthat the first victim was murdered in a shady motel on the north side of town, and that might be a good place to look. so after a small trip there using a 'borrowed' cop \ncruiser they find that they have been followed by the alleged partner. claiming they know too much, he begins combat with our group, alone. hes able to kill the rancher, and is \nthen shortly after then killed by the ex marine. no tears were shed for the rancher, even tho he was the one who had the best investigating rolls and led the group.\nthe klepto searches the dead imposter, and finds his gun and a dagger, and takes them for herself. the marine decided that, despite the self defence, it is a crime scene and \nmust be contained. the kepto is able to put the gun back, but keep the knife without the other part members knowledge. (gotta love them thieves). at this time the police arrive \nand do their thing, and then the marine notices the van the man was driving in is shaking. when investigated, it is revealed there are two men inside. enter our full party, \nnow consisting of Bud, jack, savvy and marcus (yay! now we can have real fun!)\n\nafter meeting the asian instantly hates the marine due to racial tensions following WW2 and always disagree on everything (yay plausible party conflicts!). but theyre able to \nlead our group to the local library where they intend to learn more about whats been going on, because these killings have happened before, based on the journalists previous \nfindings and reason he came to the city in the first place. after another small trip using the dead mans van and their 'borrowed' police cruiser, they find that it is indeed a \ncult involved with their killings (now they start to freak out) and decide what to do next.\n\nafter a good nights rest, they find that a building in town has been abandoned and linked to some disappearances and think this is their only lead (no amount of DM handouts \nwould convince them this wasn't the place to go, so i adjusted accordingly for the sake of things). they arrive and the asian breaks through the back like a ninja while the \nmarine walks through the front door. they both dont know where the other is and both prepare for a fight with a cultist (yay team killings!) but luckily they call out their \nlocations and get organized. after many failed sanity checks and lucky rolls, they find an altar thats hiding a stair case to the basement (yay for evil underground lairs!).\n\nafter one member briefly goes insane due to listening to a cursed radio and another kicking an metal sliding door quite unsuccessfully, they alert the three cultists inside \n(yay more combat!). after a hard fought battle with terrible rolls from everyone (the dice know) they all manage to kill the cultists and end the murders.they find several cult \nicons such as rings, daggers and pendants which they plan to hold onto until they can find a specialist in that particular field. and they return to their hotel for a good \nnights rest, well except for the journalist who went briefly insane looking at the developed pictures of the cultists and their pentagrams, but they burned themselves up and \nhe got better.\n\ndeciding to part ways and live life better, they receive a message from the family of their former dead party member, Rick Jameson. apparently his house and ranch has been \nexperiencing odd sounds and their might be some sort of grave robber taking bodies... this does not interest the group at all and still decide to end things (I'm making damned \nsure they stay together and do what is needed to accomplish that) and then bring back the librarian whom they had previously met. she tells them that one of their rare books, \nthe necronomicon, has been stolen. and she says the thieves accidentally left behind a letter, one that says of this book is brought to an interested party, they will be \nrewarded with whatever they can dream of. after closer examination of said letter, the buyer lives very close to the city which the former party member lived in(Had to be \ndone...)\n\nthe marine is facepalming so hard he cant speak and the other party members look on with intrigue. after a few moments, the marine looks up and says \"who wants to kill an \nelder god?\" having made a successful role in occult and lore based on the necronomicon.\n\n\nHopefully i'll be up to writing our third session next month when we all meet to see what happens next :)",

        "text": "I had been prompted to DM for the first time by my friend in the group I usually play with, who said I should try it. Out of courtesy, I decided to wait until his campaign was over. I didn’t realize that it was a multi-chapter overly complex deep intrigue thriller until the next session, so I decided I’d find my own group to DM for. I asked an old friend from my hometown, the guy who first introduced me to RPGs, and he said that he wasn’t currently playing any games. He said that he had some friends at the school he went to who lived in the area that he could invite. The next week, he said that his siblings both wanted to play too. From a guy who’s never played in a Tabletop group bigger than 4, I was really excited find out that we’d have 5 players for the first session, and maybe up to 7 by the third or fourth session.\n\nI bounced a couple of setting ideas off of my cousin (who declined to play), and the one he said stuck with him was the idea I had about South Jersey. The campaign would be set in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, a mystical and dangerous land of quicksand, rattlesnakes, ghosts and pork roll sandwiches. It already had a rich and varied mythology I could draw from, I wouldn’t need a map, and I could play up the survival aspect or the intrigue aspect depending on what my players wanted. I was set.\n\nMy players arrived at my table with their dice and their character ideas. I told them that they’d be meeting at a campsite in Wharton State Forest. What I meant to say is that they’d be playing campers and civilians at a campsite in Wharton State Forest, which lead to a number of things happening that were 10 times more entertaining than I had originally planned.\n\nThe characters, in no particular order, were\n\n* IVAN SMIRNOV, [real name Ludvic Volichnakov] (/spoiler) Russian immigrant and butcher. [Worked for a long time for the KGB as an enforcer and torturer.] (/spoiler) Skilled at anatomy, scaring party members, and chopping things into itty bitty pieces. Morbidly obese, scruffy, and meat-stained.\n\n* CAROL CHEN, Chinese-American park ranger in Wharton State Forest. Had a personal code of honor and very hotheaded. Talented with a gun, less so with a bow. Her player was new to the genre, and was very quiet.\n\n* STEVEN TOTEMAN, German-born Army brat, Iraq war veteran and amputee. Constantly seen with his three companions: A hip flask, his Winchester rifle, [and the head of a zombie prostitute.] (/spoiler)\n\n* GERRY WALTER, a slight midwesterner [ and an international art thief on the down-low after some shit went down after a botched heist in Munich.] (/spoiler) All-around good at anything involving stealth or finesse, except for situations involving social grace.\n\n* DAVID CANSECO, hermit, Bonsai enthusiast, linguist, armchair detective, Colombian-American, Bodega-owner, and [medicated schizophrenic] (/spoiler). Dumped all of his attribute points into smarts.\n\nOne thing that you will notice about these characters is that only two of them might pass as remotely “civilian”. I decided to accept them all as characters, because why not? I’d have to make up two different meeting points, though, so that I could introduce like to like before I got the entire party in the same room.\n\nDavid Canseco was walking through the forest as he always did this time of year, carrying his 1d6 recently caught trout on a stick, when he happened upon a late-night patrol by Carol. Carol, suspicious of any late-night activities in her woods, decided to roll a knowledge check as to whether fish actually did come out at night. I secretly rolled her a natural 1 on both dice, and told her some jokingly pseudoscientific reason as to why fish don’t come out at night. The two of them got into a very heated argument about whether or not trout jumped at dawn or if it was racist of Carol to ask for a fishing license. They only barely noticed a black van pull into a vacant campsite nearby…\n\n\nIvan knew that his superior, Trogdolykov, had asked him to come to this stupid jazz bar because he needed his “particular skills”. He also knew that Trogdolykov always had it out for him since he made fun of Caucasians that one time over drinks with Boris Ilyin.\n\nGerry needed the Russians’ protection, and their money. He knew that all of his contacts back in Philly were dead, or worse, and that he was willing to do anything to get back to his old standard of living. Even work for this Trogdolykov freak…\n\nSteve was having the time of his life at the bar. He knew that he’d said a funny joke to that weird guy in the corner… was he Greek? He’d seen him around at some of the seedier bars in Jersey City. All he knew was that this was the best whiskey he’d had in a while.\n\n“So, gentlemen, I require your assistance on this matter, so long as you don’t ask any questions.” Said Trogdolykov. He pulled the curtain on the private room back to reveal the corpse of a prostitute, not a few minutes dead. “I’ll deal with the sheets, you deal with the body. There’s a black truck with another set of plates around back. Here are the keys. Get down to the Barrens and get rid of it. Grab the big guy over there, he told me earlier that he had connections with certain… less reputable groups. Call me when you’re done.” Gerry protested weakly. Ivan rubbed his hands together menacingly. Steve volunteered to drive.\n\n[In all honesty, I completely improvised that whole bit, it was the only thing I could think of to get all three of them together in the same place] (/spoiler)\n\nAs soon as they got to the campsite designated by their map as a \"secluded spot\", the three of them began to bicker about how they wanted to deal with the dead body in the trunk. Ivan offered to cut it up into tiny little bits and bury it in the ground. Steve said that it was quicker to wrap her in plastic and throw her in the nearby lake. Gerry recommended just leaving her body in the middle of the woods. That was about when I started asking them to make notice checks.\n\n\"The tall one in there's in his mid thirties, carries himself like a soldier. He's carrying a weapon and a weighted object probably a hip flask on his side...\" dictated David to noone in particular. David rolled really high on all of his notice rolls for the characters, so he got to be Sherlock Holmes for a little bit. \"Enough of this...\" sighed Carol as she strolled confidently towards the unmarked van.\n\nThe three stooges in the car all scrambled to come up with a good excuse for what they were doing in an unmarked van at midnight in a vacant campsite.\n\n\"Hello, can I ask you what you folks are doing in the park this late? It's officially closed after 10.\"\n\nIvan, seeing no one else coming up with any suggestions, blurted out the first thing he could think of, in a comically heavy Russian accent.\n\n\"Marijuanas. We are smoking the marijuanas and want you to leave us be.\"\n\nAfter the group stopped laughing, Carol's player shrugged and said \"I roll perception check for marijuana.\"\n\nAnother natural 1.\n\n\"You smell a strange, oily odor coming from the back of the truck, and its something you've never smelled before.\"\n\n\"Do you have a license for that?\"\n\nIvan shrugged. \"Probably.\"\n\nCarol tugged on the door. \"I'm going to ask you to step out of the car while I call the police.\" \n\nSteve quickly sobered up, and after Gerry's attempts to convince Carol not to call the cops failed, Steve pulled out his winchester and aimed right for her face. David took this as an opportunity to make his leave, and he ran as fast as he could down the path in the opposite direction. Scrambling for ways to keep him with the party, I ask him to draw for a random encounter. He draws hearts, NPCs. I quickly say that two youngsters in flowy black robes and basketball shoes walk up the path holding a knapsack. They do not notice him, because they are not walking on the path. They drop something and David picks it up: an ancient looking text titled \"Initiation Rites of the Compact of Lords\". This prompts him to follow the two kids to find out what they're up to.\n\n\"Oh, cool! The otherth are here too!\" says the tall kid in the robes upon seeing a veritable mexican standoff in the middle of a campground. \"Are you guyth here for the theremony? Do you guyth have the \"thacrifithe\" for the \"ritual\"?\".\n\nSteve is quick to affirm that yes, they are members of the Compact of Lords here to initiate them, that yes, they just forgot their robes at home, and that yes, that is a very very realistic CPR dummy we will be using for the \"ceremony\". David emerges from the woods speaking in Spanish, motioning by his possession of the initiation book that he is the leader of the local chapter of the Compact of Lords. \n\n[I was flying by the seat of my pants at this point, I had no idea where the hell the story was going to go from here] (/spoiler)\n\nHe gives the book to the two kids, who read off a number of passages from the book above the dead body (David detected them as being mostly Swedish metal lyrics). Then, one of the boys reads something in a strange language that nobody recognizes and both boys collapse to the ground, quivering.\n\nThen, the prostitute gets up. Followed by the other two boys.\n\nCombat is quick-- Steve puts out most of the group's damage and single-handedly kills two of the zombies, Carol misses all of her shots with the bow, Ivan finishes off the third zombie with a decapitation, Gerry hides up a tree, and David spends the entire combat encounter trying to find Gerry.\n\nThen, at the end of combat, Gerry and Steve force Carol and David to dig a grave while Ivan chops up the bodies. Steve saves the afroed head of the prostitute in his backpack. The \"prostitute slurry\" as it is is sitting in a pile next to the gravesite, and Steve knocks out David and Carol and stuffs them in the back of the van.\n\n As they are about to fill the grave and cover it up, they notice a presence watching them from the woods. They leave the mangled bodies where they are, jump in the van, and split, barely noticing a massive wolf watching them from their rear view mirror...\n\nDavid wakes up, and quickly sends a message to his friend Mr. Arai. If he doesn't text Mr. Arai every 10 minutes, Mr. Arai is to call the police and assume the worst. David announces this to the rest of the group as they drive down a secluded road in the forest, and they all pull over and pull their guns on David. Carol sits quietly in the corner as Steve apologizes profusely to her. Gerry rolls well enough to hack David's phone, to see that an x mark has been sent to Mr. Arai, who replied with a smiley emoticon. Steve breaks Carol's bow, Gerry takes all of David's stuff (all at gunpoint), and Ivan calls his Mob contact, Boris Ilyan, to get the police off his tail. I completely improvised Boris, doing my best impression of Russian Brian Blessed. Ivan rolled very well, getting Boris to call his local police contacts and tell them to ignore any dispatches into the Pine Barrens.\n\nThe group then sees something they didn't expect: a portly man in a kevlar vest and a polo shirt duct taping their windows. He explains that they are on private property, and that they are being towed. Steve swings his gun at him, but ten more polo shirted mooks jump out of the woods with guns drawn. The polo shirts then tape up their car, and tow it to an undisclosed location, with the group still inside...\n\n[I had no idea where the hell the session was going the entire time. I also had the most fun I've ever had in an RPG. The party had fun for sure, because they came back for another session. There are more stories, if anyone's interested...] (/spoiler)",

        "text": "So I'm playing a LN Elven Necromancer.  This is a journal entry written after our first session.  Zelbringen's family was for some reason targeted by a lich that I have named Xalibar the Black, and all but him were killed by the creature.  My GM and I haven't worked out all the details just yet, but he became a Wizard for the express purpose of hunting down and destroying Xalibar.\n\nI have met with a group of inferior intellects, to go on this journey to the Spine of the World, and accomplish this mission I have been set upon by my master.\n\nWe traveled by horse accompanying a few wagons on the road leading to the North out of Waterdeep.  The smelly, and quite disagreeable, caravan leader harangued us for not setting a proper watch on the third night, and discussed with us regarding the proper delegation of camp tasks.  Boring drivel, if you ask me.  He also mentioned that he had spoken with a local farmer who had mentioned that his daughter had gone missing...\n\nWe immediately set out to rescue said maiden, and after a short ride were set upon by a group of goblin-kin, shooting from ambush.  A few of the party were struck by the crudely wrought arrows, but none of the creatures dared to attack myself.  I dismounted, and began to engage them with my bow, but realized that there were sufficient numbers to overwhelm us if I didn't make judicious use of my magic.  Predictably, the barbarian, who calls himself Charlemagne, mindlessly charged into battle with no thought for tactics.\n\nFortunately, the fight was swiftly resolved due to the use of the magical abilities of myself and the other spell casters present.  A few minor wounds were suffered, and much whining about the limited availability of healing magic was heard.\n\nSome few of the goblins were still alive, due to the influence of the magical sleep cast by the bard, Orchalon.  This allowed me to question a few of the surviving attackers.  I only had to cut off a couple fingers and the throat of one of the goblins, before another spoke of a \"Dark Man\" who had hired them to hinder any rescue attempts.  Perhaps this \"Dark man\" has a store of useful magic I can make use of in my quest to destroy Xalibar the Black?  I promised the squealing runt that he would go free if he would lead us this \"Dark Man\".  He did try to finagle an earlier release by teasing me with some notion of a tale, but I was able to suppress the curiosity that was stirred by the offer.\n\nAfter the fight, I was also able to unravel a few more spells, that my master had placed within my spellbook prior to my leaving his tower.  Witnessing the bard's casting of his sleep spell unlocked my understanding of the same writings within my spellbook.  I have also deciphered the means to ritually summon a magical familiar to assist me.  Much thought will be required before I cast this, as the choice of familiar is critical to my rise to power.  Regardless, I will begin, once the necessary components have been gathered, with a mundane creature before I attempt the binding of an imp from the lower planes.\n\nThe group took a short rest to recover from the stresses of combat and we then continued on in our search for the missing farmer's daughter......",

        "text": "So some people were interested in how my first game went with Xcom changed in to a table-top RPG format. I'm using the d20 Modern system, combined with aspects of the game such as the AIM and firing format (0 (Base) + (Elevation (20)) + (Attackers AIM) - (Defenders DEF) - (Cover (20/40)) +/- (Ability) = % to hit.) All other skills and feats are done through d20 Modern. I knew that out of the gate this would make the game super unbalanced on the alien side, so my plan was to make things as hard as possible for the players. They're not just normal Xcom grunts, they are *heroic* Xcom grunts. In future games it will get much harder (can't say how, some of my players will be reading this).\n\nFirst off I took /u/rgnmal 's storyline idea (parts of it anyway) from my [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/2ru3hu/lw_i_run_xcom_table_top_role_playing_games/). My wife (the 'civilian' scientist) is atually from Xcom, and has been sent to get samples of the green glowing stuff after it had covered a civilian from the [weird green glowing pods](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0-iDkXsIrLI/UJPwYoTiCWI/AAAAAAAAAbo/WJnfgjV-IQs/s1600/XComGame+2012-11-02+15-38-17-73.jpg) that you find in abduction missions. You know, the ones that are **never explained in game**. Since this *should* be a simple in-and-out mission to an abduction area cleared by an Xcom squad, Bradford decided this would be a great audition mission as well for some new squaddies. The new soldiers would be completely unaware of Xcom, and the world at large unaware of the alien threat. Only the scientist is aware of anything going on, as well as how this mission will go should things go south (i.e.: They carpetbomb the area.) Game would start very early on in the war, but the kicker is that Xcom itself is doing *very badly* and needs new soldiers.\n\nFrom here on out, play will proceed in bullet fashion to organize things better.\n\n* Recruited grunts are as follows: \n * \"Wraith\". Navy Seal trained stealth loner operative. Made as an 'assassin', the player decided to take \"Scout\" and \"Fast Hero\" as his classes. Made CO of the op, his job would be to guard the civilian. Took a lot of extra gear such as night vision goggles, chem sticks, stun guns, ect. Decides not to take any assault weapons, instead opting for just a pistol, a knife, and a few grenades.\n * \"Eyes\". Army trained sniper. Started with \"Sniper\" and \"Fast Hero.\" His job would be to cover extraction and be standard overwatch. Didn't really take much extra gear, but he had the 'extraction' panic button. He was *told* this was supposed to bring back the helicopter that dropped them off. In reality it would call in a hellfire missile strike to the area. Xcom is taking no chances. Also had his 'Squadsight' headset which would give him a view of the other team member's helmet cams, and do the calculations where to shoot.\n * \"Dozer\". Ex-Army trained demolitions expert. \"Engineer\" and \"Tough Hero\". Liked to blow things up just a *little* too much. Sort of the anti-stealth, which was hilarious in conjunction with the stealthy Scout and Sniper. Took a grenade launcher, lots of extra grenades, and was also given enough semtex to level the building. His job was to get in to the basement floor of the building and set up enough det-cord to level the building once the team was out.\n * \"Gage\". \"Civilian\" scientist, in reality on her first field mission for the Xcom research division. Took \"Smart Hero\" but not an Xcom class, since she wasn't supposed to be a field officer. Actually in charge of the team, and the only one with a private line to Xcom HQ. Her secondary objective was to evaluate the new recruits for Xcom. She knew the risks going in full well, and that if *any* opposition was found, she wasn't expected to make it back alive.\n\nWow that was a lot of typing. Okay, I'll make the rest of this quicker.\n\n* Team is flown to Fort Lewis, WA. Given gear, objectives, and blueprints, they are sent to an area in Tacoma, WA that was recently cleared of 'terrorist activity'.\n* AO is an old office building, 10 stories tall. They are to enter via helicopter, then find the 'blast' area of a bomb they set off. The scientist will collect samples of explosive residue, then they leave.\n* Team lands in a parking garage attached to the office building. Parking garage is 2 stories tall, attached to the 10 story tall building. The 7th, 8th, and 9th floors are caved inwards, but no one recognizes the blast pattern. Rubble is everywhere, and the area is cleared of civilian life for blocks around.\n* Team quickly sets up in their locations. Wraith scouts ahead, Dozer covers Gage, Eyes takes up position on a semi tractor trailer.\n* Wraith moves forwards, and is the first to hear the sounds of [movement coming out of the bottom floor of the parking garage](http://i.imgur.com/VDslj0N.jpg). They prepare for contact.\n\n**Combat 1**\n* One sectoid pops it's head over the ramp leading up from the 1st floor. Wraith is ready, keeps his cool (fantastic Will save), and pops it in the shoulder. After it tumbles down, he tosses a Flashbang down after it.\n* Gage, excited once she sees one of the abduction pods on the parking garage, rushes forward away from Dozer to see if any genetic material is left so that she can complete her objective without having to infiltrate the building.\n* Gage is the first to see a pod of 5 Sectoids that have just been hit by a Flashbang *right* in the center, and are all disoriented. Thankfully she has high ground and is covered by the abduction pod. One fires from Overwatch (the only one to not be stunned) and misses.\n* Wraith, after seeing the shots from down below, rolls a fragmentation (AP) down after his Flashbang, and liquefies all but two of the poor stunned Sectoids.\n* Dozer moves up, Eyes enters overwatch.\n* Sectoids move up in to the 2nd floor. One moves behind Gage's abduction pod, the other doesn't make it far as Eyes takes him out. Gage moves around the pod and kills the last one with her Assault Carbine that she didn't want to take in the first place.\n* Team, excluding Eyes still on the trailer, moves down to the second floor and in to the building.\n* Team keeps questioning Gage on what the hell just happened, but she is neglecting to give any answers, instead radioing back to base that there *are* still mo-fuggin aliens in the AO.\n* Xcom HQ says they will send backup if anymore opposition is found.\n\n**Combat 2**\n* Dozer moves in to the basement alone. Encounters 3 Sectoids and something else that gets away and jumps *up* the elevator shaft before he can see it. His grenade launcher makes short work of them, but lights the basement on fire. He completes his objective to set up the semtex and gets out before the fire can reach him.\n* While taking out the Sectoids, Dozen somehow manages to get close enough to one to us the stun baton he got off the body of a security guard in the parking garage and gets Xcom's *first live capture*. He drags it away to rejoin the rest of the squad.\n\n\n* Meanwhile Wraith and Gage have made it up to the 4th floor, where they see a civilian running around some cubicles. They were told this area was supposed to be cleared of any civilians. They approach with caution. \n* She radios Xcom about Dozer's aliens in the basement, and they say they'll send exfil if things get any more hairy.\n* Eyes is watching the building, when he notices off in the distance an approaching UFO. He has no idea what it is, but keeps an eye on it.\n* He radios back to base about the UFO, and is told that the area is in \"Xcom jurisdiction now\". When he asks what the hell *that* means, he gets no answer.\n\n**Combat 3**\n* Using Squadsight, Eyes spots where the civilian is hiding, and checks it out with his zoom scope. Spots that the 'civilian' in fact has a plasma pistol in his hand, and looks *weird*. He also spots the other Thinman hiding around a corner of the cubicle row waiting for someone to poke their head out.\n* Wraith is sneaking around the corner to find this 'civilian', when Eyes takes out the one hiding. Gage, who is following him, comes under fire from 2 Sectoids that were hiding under desks.\n* Gage runs back in to the stairwell. Wraith attempts to find the other Thinman who ran, and instead somehow has the genius idea to look *up*, where the Thinman decided to cling to the ceiling to clean up on him. He uses his stun gun, darts it, and holds down the button for a couple rounds, before acquiring their *second* live capture, and his own plasma pistol.\n* The rest of the Sectoids are taken out very quickly by Wraith slitting one's throat, and Eye's *brilliantly* shooting out some ceiling tiles above one, causing the roof to cave in and crack open it's skull (it was seriously an awesome roll).\n\n* While Eyes is outside watching the UFO, an Interceptor comes in, hits it once, then is shot down, sending the Interceptor hurtling in to some buildings with explosive force that everyone hears. He estimates that the UFO will arrive in about 20 minutes, and radios this to Gage since Fort Lewis is no longer answering.\n* Gage radios back to Xcom HQ about the UFO. She receives word that, \"Skyranger is on it's way for exfil. Finish your objectives, then get to extraction point.\" This causes her to have an, \"Oh shit they're sending the Skyranger itself!\" moment.\n* In the combat, Gage has ran up the next 3 floors. She reaches the 7th floor before finding the stairway has collapsed from the explosion on the 8th floor, and moves to the elevator shaft ladder.\n* Wraith moves to the elevator shaft and decides to take the 'express elevator' up. He grabs on to the cable and, using the plasma pistol, burns through it. The counterweight releases and starts to SLING him upwards. The elevator crashes down to the now on fire basement.\n* Suddenly Wraith's dice fail him *horribly*, and even though he uses Action Points like Skittles, ends up almost falling to his death. Barely propels himself to *fly* past Gage in to the 7th floor, where he hits hard enough to fall unconscious for a bit (0 HP).\n* Gage climbs to the 8th floor where she stealthily peaks around and [finds not only her objective, but that someone else got their first](http://i.imgur.com/vyPj2Ic.jpg). She decides to wait for backup, even though they are on limited time.\n\n**Almost Combat 3**\n* Dozer, on his way up, leaves his Sectoid captive with Eyes, then also grabs and drags out the Thinman captive that Wraith ziptied and lowered to the 2nd floor.\n* Gage waits as Dozer climbs the rest of the elevator ladder, now full of smoke, to reach her. She takes the time to attach climbing gear to the elevator shaft.\n* Dozer looks at the situation, then whispers to her about the 2 captives they have.\n* Gage radios back to Xcom HQ about the live captives. Excited, Xcom HQ decides the captives are more important than their lives, and tell them to get to the extraction point right away.\n* Wraith, in the mean time, has gotten himself upright enough to attach climbing gear to the 7th floor, and is getting ready to get himself down to the extraction point in his horrible broken state.\n* Gage starts lowering herself down the elevator shaft, when Dozer decides the last few aliens on the top need to die. He botches (rolls a 1) on his Grenade throw, and the explosion flies IN to the elevator shaft, shearing Gage's climbing cable they are both attached to.\n* Gage manages to latch herself to the ladder, then rolls fantastically (with the use of some Action Points) to grab on to Dozer enough to swing him in to the 7th floor (much the same as Wraith did).\n* Dozer (who took far less plasma damage than Wraith did) is barely injured by the fall, and notices Wraith's horrible broken body attempting to repel itself down to the parking garage.\n* Eyes, out of no where, hears *something* pop the sound barrier *five times in a row* speeding towards them, the *opposite* way of the UFO that is almost on top of them.\n* The Skyranger comes in and lands, scaring the living hell out of Eyes. An Xcom squad introduces themselves (their Sniper actually used a grapple suit to leap on to the trailer from the Skyranger's hatch in mid-air), then helps him drag in the unconscious ET's for extraction.\n* Dozer attaches a now unconscious Wraith to himself and repels them down 5 floors. Gage follows.\n* Everyone gets in the Skyranger and heads home.\n* They watch as an Interceptor comes in and blasts the hell out of the UFO, then another comes in with Hellfire missiles and takes out the building they had just left. Dozer hits the button for his semtex, since, \"You don't want to waste explosives.\"\n\n* Once back in NORAD base, Colorado, Bradford explains Xcom to the new recruits, and invites them to join.\n* He also explains that this was their first *real* win of the war, before chastising their extraction squad. He explains that Fort Lewis was leveled almost right after they left by aliens, and that the war is *not* going well.\n\nOkay, that was *waaaaay* more typing than I expected. All in all I'm realizing that I have to really re-do how we've done things. I gave the team *way* too much Defense, and the aliens are *way* too weak (about 17 aliens and the team was barely scratched). There's a lot of rules between the two games that just don't work, and grenades are way more powerful than they should be. Since the squad didn't have to worry about bringing bodies back (not that they knew or cared) they just blew up everything they saw. The squad had some great ideas with extra gear, and some very clever uses of the environment. In the future I am going to make things much, much more difficult (yes Wraith, I know you're reading this.)",

        "text": "[Another tale of that ~~magical realm~~ mysterious world of mine!](http://redd.it/2pa5p0) For those of you who weren't here last time, [the party (consisting of Rose the dullahan ranger and her stolen cat, Pratena the voracious cyclops murderchild, Sleazeball the summoner and his distinctly female eidolon, and Fishnaut the astrophilic sorcerer)](http://imgur.com/a/7dUG1) was currently encamped in a town of gnomes, trying desperately to get some sleep among the sounds of machinery, loud bickering, explosions, and the whine of buzzsaws. Fishnaut, unfortunately, had gotten on the bad side of their tavern's surly european proprietor (who went by the name of Tarlov) by way of trying to steal a crate of ice cream. This went exceedingly poorly.\n\nThings looked up for him in the morning, though- three gnomes had heard his heartfelt plea for a space program, and constructed a device that would launch him high into the air. Incredibly enthusiastic, Fishnaut cheerfully perched himself on the \"seat\" as the three gnomes cast a quick Grease spell on him (as a Vertical Velocity Negation Measure) and pulled the lever that fired the catapult.\n\nFishnaut got an exceedingly lovely view of the countryside, and then a rather sheer cliff, and then a patch of shrubbery, and then lots and lots of gravel. One thing was certain- the Grease certianly got rid of his vertical speed, it's just that it didn't exactly... go away. About a minute later,  Fishnaut skidded back into the gnome village on the tattered remainders of his ass, traveling at about 30 miles per hour. He careened off a workshop, lapsed into a nauseating spin, crashed into a pedestrian, filled his helmet with vomit, and was escorted to the local \"hospital\" where he was stuffed into a full-body cast and given a very large bill. The three gnomes who had launched him came by to visit, checked he was alive, informed him that it was a bad idea to steal from gnomes, and then walked out laughing.\n\nThe rest of the party was not particularly amused, but they thankfully had a cart at hand. They set out of the town, heading toward a set of coordinates on a few business cards they had recieved a few days ago from a cyclops that had apparently been part of some sort of mercenary troupe- \"Asshole Patrol\". Despite the absolutely cringeworthy name, the party had little else to do and some violence sounded really fun right about now, so off they went, hallucinating Fishnaut in tow.\n\nThe journey was long, but relatively uneventful. Pratena and her incredible appetite had to make a few stops to do a few \"foraging\" expeditions (from which she usually returned caked in blood and dragging the mangled, chewed carcass of some unfortunate animal), but on the whole things went suprisingly smoothly.\n\nWell, except for the part where they had to climb a mountain and stopped to rest halfway up. They stumbled into a cave containing a mountain lion, and despite Rose's protests, Sleazeball commanded his eidolon to slit its throat. This did not work. The entire cave was sprayed in blood, the poor beast lurched around trying to defend itself, and it was eventually decapitated directly into Rose's lap.\n\n*FATAL ERROR: ROSE.exe has encountered a problem and has stopped responding.*\n\nRose promptly removed her own helmet and collapsed backwards onto the floor. Everyone else was fairly happy with the result, though- now there was food and something resembling a warm blanket. It just might have been nice if someone had taken the time to remove the severed head from Rose's lap before she put her helmet back on.\n\nWith that, the party arrived at the massive, imposing gates of some sort of structure built into the mountain peak. No doubt about it, this was where the business cards had directed them- this was very likely the headquarters of Asshole Patrol.  \nThey didn't expect it to be so big.  \nOr dark.  \nOr empty.\n\nThe place was absolutely huge, which is why it was decidedly odd that there was only one occupant. A naga (that is, a woman with the lower body of a snake) was perched at a messy desk far in the back of the enormous hall, cursing under her breath and shuffling things around in the light of a few dim bonfires. She wasn't particularly surprised when the party approached, and she introduced herself as the coordinator of the Asshole Patrol eastern division. She was also not surprised (but a little impressed) to find that they had been recommended by one of her top field agents, and were looking for a job.\n\nThat was clearly what she wanted to hear. After some brief introductions and a lecture on the tenants of the Asshole Patrol (which consisted of \"1: Kill Assholes, 2: Make Money, 3: Help People, in that order, any questions?\") the team was pretty much immediately given a selection of assignments that needed doing. The party debated between investigating a weird, vaguely xenophobic town and murdering the shit ouf a much more blatantly xenophobic band of reptillian-killing assholes. Eventually they decided to go after the racist murder-troupe.\n\n\n--\n\n\nThe party arrived in some dense scrublands, on the way to the last known location of the murder-troupe, when they spied what was pretty clearly the troupe, perched on a large cart sitting in the middle of some particularly dense foliage, clearly in the middle of an argument. While most of them debated avenues of attack, Sleazeball immediately stripped his eidolon naked and sent her running through the bushes towards the murder-troupe.\n\nShe was quickly taken up by the concerned troupe, who confirmed that yes, they were indeed the vigilantes protecting the world from the reptillian menace. But what exactly were you doing running through this neck of the woods, miss?\n\nA few barely-failed bluff checks later, the troupe was getting suspicious. Stories of a Kobold attack were quickly debunked, and the old crone of the troupe (who happened to be holding her massive, gross eye in her hands) decided that their \"rescue\" was acting damn suspicious. Sleazeball decided that the jig was up and dropped the horses hitched to the troupe's cart into a magical pit. Next was the troupe's centaur, who had an abysmal reflex save and an even worse climb skill. With that, the troupe's rogue (a tengu) spotted to party and shrieked that they were being attacked, and combat begun.\n\nWell, I say that, but what followed was less like a battle and more like kicking a rabid dog in the ribs over and over until you started to feel bad. Sleazeball's eidolon, taking advantage of the distraction, pushed one of the murder-troupe (a satyr) into the same pit as the centaur with a truly impressive slam attack.  The more melee-oriented members of the party were struggling to get into range through all the godsdamned foliage (except for Rose, who acted a bit like a steamroller in a bubble wrap factory) so everyone was nice and close when the Satyr started playing a lullaby on his pipes. Unfortunately for him, he was interrupted mid-song by Sleazeball's eidolon, who had impaled him with a claw and drenched his centaur buddy with blood. Ultimately, the satyr had only actually put two people to sleep- both of them part of the muder-troupe.\n\nThe Gnoll member of the murder-troupe attempted a daring leap to meet the party head on, botched his acrobatics check, and broke several bones on the way into the pit with his centaur comrade. The tengu rogue got flanked by Rose and Pratena while Sleazeball summoned a dire rat on top of the sleeping hag-woman, and had it tear out her throat. It took two tries. The only other member of the troupe, a catfolk woman dual-wielding rapiers, had been knocked out by the satyr's music, and was promptly thrown into the centaur-pit.\n\nAnd just like that, the battle was over. All of the troupe was either dead, stuck in the pit, or, in the case of the tengu, fleeing as fast as their legs could take them. The only conscious member of the troupe was the centaur, who was crying and cursing the party from inside the pit as he tried not to step on the crumpled forms of his dying friends. Sleazeball had his eidolon slash at the poor man's face, neatly dodging several retaliatory punches until the poor bastard finally lost consciousness.\n\nIt was at this point that shit actually hit the fan. Sleazeball congratulated himself on a job well done, but the rest of the party had some reservations. Rose had been in favor of at least talking to the troupe before they charged in like the murderhobos they were, and Fishnaut had some very salient points about Sleazeball's streak of completely unnecessary cruelty (Pratena had no opinion, and was deciding which dying enemy looked the tastiest).\n\nBarbed words led to harsh words, which led to shouting and insults and a very heated argument that ended when Sleazeball had his eidolon grip Fishnaut by the neck and start squeezing. Fishnaut retaliated with a hasty scorching ray aimed at Sleazeball, which also managed to graze a nearby dry scrub. Rose and Pratena tried to call off Sleazeball, but by this point he was absolutely furious, screaming at everyone about how they all thought they were better than him and always took issue with his \"hardcore\" strategy. Rose drew her weapons and Pratena drew in closer.\n\nSleazeball casted some minor magic at them, too, before he started to sidle away to let his eidolon handle things. Trouble was, he wasn't quite far enough- Pratena leapt.\n\nCritical hit.\n\nSleazeball gasped: \"My only regret... was not killing the Jews.\" Then he collapsed, blood spurting from the collosal bite that had been taken out of his sternum. His eidolon, fading, apologized to the party for her compliance with all of Sleazeball's bullshit. The party bade her farewell, with no hard feelings... and then they realized that, oh yeah, they had started a brush fire just a minute before.\n\nTIME TO GO.\n\nPratena and Rose hurled the unconscious/dead bodies of most of the troupe onto the back of the troupe's cart (for loot purposes) while Fishnaut hastily tried to re-tie the panicking horses to their snapped reigns. With no room to turn, they spurred the horses forward, making agonizingly slow progress while the fire spread like... well, wildfire. They escaped, barely managing to pat out some lingering flames that had caught on the rear of the cart. \n\nWith that, they were away. They had two stable prisoners and one dead hag full of magical paraphenalia, and they had lost their most abrasive and amoral party member. Hell of a first mission.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Blood money\", SERVING UNDER DURESS AND WAS THAT BARREL ALWAYS THERE?](http://redd.it/2sj261)",

        "text": "[Link to the Beginning](http://redd.it/2qsz9c)\n\n[Link to Previous Part](http://redd.it/2ricpd)\n\nThe swarm of monsters beat on the wall downstairs.  The innkeeper had stopped groaning threats out at them, and the trapdoor stairs hadn’t moved since the Rogue had used his knife as a wedge to drive the pull rope through.\n\nMatt stared at the Halfling in stunned silence for several seconds.  “Really?  That’s what you’re upset about right now?  Losing your knife?”\n\n“Uh,” Mark said, “yeah.  That knife was sharp enough to cut a god!”\n\n“But not sharp enough to cut a knot of rope,” John, the Cleric of Ra, pointed out.  “Which god were you planning on cutting with that knife?”\n\n“None in particular,” the Halfling grumbled softly, “though a Cleric of the Sun God is started to look like a good place to start.”\n\n“What was that?” John asked.\n\nMark lifted himself off of the floor and glanced at the window at the end of the hall.  “Nothing,” the Halfling said as he patted John on the shoulder.  He yawned and started walking toward their room.  “Well, my watch is over.  Your turn, Holy Man.”\n\n“What?” John said at the same time Matt mumbled, “Is this half-pint serious?”\n\nThe Rogue walked into their room, collapsed on the bed.  Both of the Humans thudded down the hall and looked through the door.  Mark had already fallen asleep and was snoring softly.  The two shared a look, and Matt nodded toward the innkeeper’s room.  The Cleric was about to grab the doorknob when Matt caught his hand.\n\n“There’s a small hole,” the Fighter explained, pointing at the knob.  “It may be trapped.”\n\n“Man,” John called, “it sure would be nice if we had someone who has experience with locks and traps and stuff.”  \n\nHe was answered by a snorted snore from the other room.  Matt laughed softly and lifted the maul from where it had been discarded.  \n\n“You going to go wake him up with that?” John asked.\n\nMatt laughed again.  “No, but this may wake him up.  Move over some.”  Seeing what the Fighter had identified as his skeleton key/trap disarming technique, John dove backwards as Matt swung the maul at the potentially trapped knob.\n\nThe powerful downward strike did its job as the doorknob broke free of the door and went spiraling through the air.  The sound of wood splintering had the Halfling standing in the doorway holding a knife in his hand, cocked back and ready to throw, in less than two seconds.  \n\n“What the Hell was that?” Mark shouted.\n\n“Oh,” Matt said with a smirk, “did I wake you up?”\n\nThe sleep-deprived Halfling glared at him and shuffled over to the doorknobs.  The entire assembly had broken free of the door, and Mark held it up to inspect it.  Other than a fairly noticeable dent on one side, it was in remarkably good shape.  “Why?” he asked in bewilderment.\n\n“We were worried it was trapped,” John answered.\n\nMark flipped the device over a few times and shook his head.  “The hole is for a key to unlock it from the other side.  Likely some kind of lock the innkeeper devised.”  The Rogue gave the knob and experimental twist, and the bolt retracted.  “It wasn’t even locked.”  Mark carried the device back into their room and emerged a moment later with a circular bulge on the side of his pack.\n\n“Why are you stealing the doorknob?” John asked.\n\n“Um, it’s not stealing; it’s looting, especially when your innkeeper turns out to be a possessed psychopath.  And it stood up to a blow from that maul, this thing’s well made.  I could get *some* money from it.”  \n\nThe Cleric and the Guardsman/Fighter gave the Halfling a disapproving look.  \n\n“He’s not going to use it!” Mark said, pointing down through the floor where the innkeeper had died.\n\n“Fine.”  Matt swung open the door and glanced around the innkeeper’s room.  When he deemed it safe, he stepped into the room.  Mark and John followed but froze when Matt pulled open the blinds to let the moonlight in.  Some kind of black ichors coated the bed sheets, and it seemed to eat up the meager light in the room.\n\n“What is that?” Mark asked.\n\nJohn walked over and reached a hand toward the mass.  Light enveloped his fingers, and the ichors tried to slowly ooze away.  “Cover your eyes,” the Cleric commanded, and the other two slapped their hands over their faces.  A dazzling brilliance filled the room as a powerful blast of sunlight burned away the ichors.  The smell of burning hair and flesh filled their nostrils, and a hiss-like scream came from the monsters arrayed outside.\n\n“You’re… good now,” John said, down on one knee and panting heavily.\n\nMatt helped the Cleric to his feet.  “You know, if this whole Cleric of Ra thing doesn’t work out for you, then you could always get a job as a lighthouse.”\n\nJohn managed a weak laugh.  “That’s not… how it works.”\n\n“I know.”  Matt patted him on the shoulder.  “Go lay down.  Half-pint and I will look around.”\n\nThe Cleric nodded and stumbled out of the room and back down the hall.\n\n“You know,” Mark said.  “I really don’t appreciate the short jokes.”\n\nMatt struck flint and tinder a few times to ignite a candle before answering.  “I know.  Take it as a sign that I’ve come to trust you.”  His dark green eyes met the Halfling’s brown ones.  “Just a little bit.”\n\n“I’ll take it!” the Halfling said with a grin that encompassed most of his face.\n\n“Stop stealing things!” John shouted from down the hall.\n\n“Steal everything!  Got it!” Mark shouted back.\n\nMatt laughed as he walked across the room and threw open the dresser.  His joviality was short-lived when he saw what was inside.  Several light brown button sized discs were all arrayed in a very neat row.  Each one was slightly different from the last, but they all had a small bump in the center.  \n\nMark walked over and picked one up, squeezing it softly.  He saw there were no holes in the buttons were thread would go, and the button gave a bit when squeezed.  “These are no kind of button I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“That’s because they’re nipples,” Matt explained.\n\nThe Fighter could pretty much watch the gears in the Halfling’s head grind to a halt.  “What?”\n\n“They are nipples,” he repeated.  “Desiccated nipples that this sick fuck had probably cut from peoples’ bodies.”\n\nThe Halfling carefully replaced the nipple where it had been and took a step back, wiping his fingers on his pants.  He turned and vomited noisily onto the bed.\n\n“We’ll bury them in the morning, when the sun is up.”  Mark nodded his agreement, and they searched the room for several more minutes without finding anything.  The pair retired back to their room where the Cleric was fast asleep, rebarricaded the door, and Matt let the Halfling sleep while he took the rest of the watch.\n\n---\n\nJohn again rose before the sun and relieved Matt of the watch.  He stood before the window and welcomed his God back into the world.  He felt his divine energy slowly replenish, and he waited a few hours before rousing the others.\n\nMatt told John what they had found, and the Cleric said they should leave the remains to the local priest so Last Rites could be administered by someone they were.\n\n“I think that’s what’s best,” John said.\n\nMatt and Mark nodded, but the Fighter added, “We don’t really know what’s going on in this town.  We should feel out this priest before we tell him what happened to Bruce.”\n\n“Who?” Mark asked.\n\nMatt stared at him like he was touched in the head.  “The innkeeper.  His name was Bruce.”\n\n“Oh,” the Halfling said, “I’m sorry.  Bad with names.”\n\n“And I need to speak with the girl he’s taken in.  See if I can determine the nature of these things in the night,” John said.\n\nTheir plan decided, the three went down the stairs and found that the innkeeper’s body was missing, as were any remains of their horse.  “Shit and shit again,” Matt said.\n\nJohn gave him a frown, but the holy man said nothing of his foul language.\n\n“At least the cart’s still here,” Mark said.  His mood had improved since the discovery of the remains, and he seemed to be grinning all of the time.\n\nMatt gave the Halfling a glance and said, “Why are you in such a good mood?”\n\nMark grinned.  “I was just thinking about something you said last night.”\n\n“What’s that?” the Fighter asked as he rummaged through their supplies in the back of the cart.\n\n“It’s just been a long time, since someone has said they trusted me, or anything nice at all really.  It just made me think that maybe I…”\n\n“Maybe you can what?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Mark muttered.\n\nMatt lifted a small buckler from the cart and strapped it onto his arm.  He also put a scabbard on his back and slid a two-handed great sword into it.  The Fighter strapped a brace of knives onto his arm opposite the shield and put a short sword on his hip on the far side of his longsword.\n\nJohn looked the man from head to toe.  “You look like a walking armory.  Do you have enough weapons?”\n\nThe Fighter ignored the question and pulled back the tarp a bit more.  A flanged mace went into a back belt loop, and he nodded.  “Now I do.”\n\nMark looked at the imposing sight, then down at his brace of now four functional knives.  The one he had used as a wedge had bent at a thirty-degree angle and had been discarded.  “You make me feel a little under dressed.”\n\nMatt handed the Halfling a dagger.  “There you go, Half-pint.  Though it’s more like a short sword for you.”\n\nThe Rogue held the dagger awkwardly and looked at his waist.  “I don’t have anywhere to…”\n\nHanding him a scabbard to loop his belt through, Matt said, “And now you do.”\n\n“What about you?” Mark asked, looking at the Cleric.\n\n“I usually don’t have need of a weapon,” John explained.  He pulled back the side of his robe and revealed a block-headed mace with the Eye of Ra emblazoned on the side.  “But it pays to be prepared.”\n\nMatt nodded.  “Well, let’s go meet this priest.”",

        "text": "**The System:** Savage Worlds.\n\n**The Setting:** Dodushkun, unofficial capital city of the Volbruggar Provinces, ten years since last we left our heroes. The decade has been rough on the hardy Volbruggar people under the Gerneschmenk Empire. Raids and burned fields due to a personal dispute between Lord-Governors has festered into almost open warfare. Dodushkun thus far has remained neutral, but whispers abound that Lord-Governor Gadelbrecht plans to intervene in some manner, should the fighting spill over onto his land.\n\n**The Player Characters**\n\nSaldo: A curious, reckless young man well-trained in the martial art Sanhar. He spent the previous ten years in Borderpost at the school there, and quickly rose as a student until he earned his wraps and left to take the odd job or Contract. He is just outside the Volbruggar border when he receives a letter from Alvra, calling him back to take care of the orphanage in her absence.\n\nGorvis: A confident scoundrel, Gorvis spent the last decade working under Jormind, a locksmith who is also a member of a thieve's guild specializing in selling lock specs to interested parties. He was a Lifter, one of the people the ring sent out to make sure there were feet on the ground. He is in Dodushkun when he receives his letter and goes across the city to the orphanage the next day.\n\nIngevla: Ingevla stayed in the city until she was old enough to legally stand on her own, and started taking Contracts. She spent the next ten years tramping about the land with the intent to make her Citizenry and family Name worth something again. She has been moderately successful, with a number of successful and impressive Contracts under her belt, but she answers the letter immediately once she receives it.\n\nChaya: After demonstrating her alchemical brilliance to Alvra, Chaya's guardian managed to get word to the Order of Philosophers, and the girl left soon after. Hailed as a talent, Chaya worked her way through the ranks towards mastering the Third Art of Alchemy. After a school friend leaps from a clocktower after allegedly consorting with the Forbidden Arts she dives into her schoolwork. When her letter arrives she takes a break from her education to attend.\n\nFelix: Mysteriously absent, though rumor is he was simply delayed on the road. Jokes are made at his expense about drinking water from ditches.\n\nTen years or so after our last session our heroes receive letters from Mother Alvra stating that her recent duties require her absence from the area and she requests they return to take care of the orphanage during her absence, and that if they have any questions to go to the Sunken Stone and ask for Karek. They all arrive at roughly the same time and talk about their adventures before attempting to enter the orphanage.\n\nFinding the door locked, Gorvis picks it handily. They enter the orphanage and pause...\n\nThe place is absolutely trashed. Broken pieces of furniture litter the floor, the beds are ripped apart, the chests are stomped in. They cautiously explore the building and find it empty, though Mother Alvra's room is still locked. Gorvis picks this lock and they find Alvra's room empty, though her mattress is askew. Saldo searches her desk and finds three empty imprints in the dust: an outline that looks like a dagger, and two indistinguishable square ones. Gorvis looks under the mattress and finds the outline of a door and a strange, triple-keyhole.\n\nGorvis replaces the lock on the front door with one from his master's shop, and hands out keys. The apprentice working there mentions that Jormind said he will be absent for a few days. The group puts together a group fund of their money, fixes the place up, and goes to sleep.\n\nThe next morning Gorvis goes to his normal morning bar, Chaya and Inge go supply-shopping at the Wall Market, where they end up indignantly bartering with a carpenter to make them some cheap chairs. After berating him on his obvious over-charging, he drops the price and promises delivery within the next one-and-a-half weeks.\n\nThey all meet up at the Sunken Stone  and quiz the bartender, Gill, about this man, Karek. The bartender says he has a room on retainer, but only visits every so often. Inge bribes him with 5% of his yearly wage, so he lets them into the man's room. They find nothing unusual, but Inge leaves a note saying, \"Wayward Souls\" and leave.\n\nThe next morning there's a knock at the door. They answer and it's Karek's wife. She asks why they're asking about her husband, and they don't answer. She says that he's dead and they need to leave her be. They show her the last two lines of the letter that instruct them to look for him, and she calms down. She apologizes and says that they can pay their respects at a graveyard overlooking where the river enters the lake.\n\nThey make their way through the Sprawl and towards the graveyard. It's a fair walk, but they make it in good speed. Once there they inspect the graveyard and find the right stone. While discussing what to do about it, Gorvis bends down real low, takes a whiff of that dirt, realizes something isn't right, reaches in, and feels a key. He tries to palm it, but Saldo sees through his shit and calls him out on it. After a speech from Chaya about family, they leave.\n\nThey head back to the orphanage, making it just inside the gate before they closed it for dusk.They open up the bed-door first, and find an extensive stash of alchemy ingredients, enough to stump even Chaya. At the bottom in a locked chest are four ingots of [Talmium](http://www.reddit.com/r/Iumendros/comments/2kzh5m/talmium/), an incredibly dangerous magical stone that can be programmed to perform magic. Unfortunately, too much exposure can cause Talmium Sickness, which kills pretty much all the time. They put that back.\n\nSaldo goes and tries the key in the fountain keyhole. It makes a lot of deep mechanical noises and a set of stairs descends into the ground. The group, led by Saldo, descends, follows a long tunnel, and find a ladder that descends deep into darkness. Undeterred, Saldo marches onward.\n\nAt the bottom of the ladder they find...a [room](http://imgur.com/uy3rbmX). It has a few chests, filled with tinderboxes, rope, changes of clothing, all manner of things used to survive. There are two beds, well-made, and a table with a sword on it. On the floor in the center of the room is a bloodied sword lying in a drying pool of the stuff. There's a cabinet containing some nice chain shirts and two swords that match the two already out.\n\nOn the wall is a huge map of the city, including the isles. Pinned in maybe a dozen places are little flags, unmarked except by individual colors. They puzzle over this before seeing the half-open door. Once opened fully, it reveals a passage, long and low, that slopes slightly downward in the direction of the lake...\n\nAnd that's where we faded to black, as our reunited ragamuffins venture into unknown depths...dun, dun, duuuun...",

        "text": "Hawaii Bois in Seattle\n\n(A three session story summed up in one entry, which almost goes over the letters cap.)\n\nPART 1\n\nAs with all things in the Camarilla, it began with an inconsequential request: \"Those humans that disappeared near your place; could you keep an eye out for them?\". It should've been simple. After all, the three missing university students probably got drunk at some party and woke up on the wrong train. Then again, they had been missing for a week. Sooo, really drunk? Either way, the party wasn't going to just disobey a \"request\" from their mentor so they might as well find them quick so they could get back to their favorite pastimes of drift racing, papaya collecting, drug trafficking, and seduction. \n\nThey all piled into their shitty, old sedan: Lukans, a Gangrel who informally led the coterie (or at least drove them everywhere which is close enough), J, a Toreador in shotgun who was more concerned with that night's meal than the missing humans, Joseph, a Malkavian with a broad sense of what was 'funny', and crammed in the trunk, London, a papaya-wielding Nosferatu.\n\nFinding the University was easy, finding a party - any party - was easy, finding someone who actually knew any of the vics was hard. Luckily, one of the girl at the party had last seen one of the missing people, Jessica Parker, the night she disappeared. Of course, she was just as unhelpful, but gave the coterie the idea to figure out the last location of Jessica's phone. A few hours of hacking later, the crew had their target: a warehouse in downtown Seattle. Back in the shitty-mobile.\n\nPARTE DOS\n\nThey arrived an hour later and parked in the shadows of a warehouse a block away. Getting out they noticed two unusual things. First, their friend, Joseph 2, was there. The last they'd heard from him that week was him quickly muttering about some 'rocker chick' somewhere. Small world. Secondly, standing next to him was Joseph's Malkavian mentor, Kurt King, staring off into the distance. \n\n\"Hey Joseph 2, how'd you know we'd be here?\", said Lukans.\n\"Didn't. I was following these guys for my girl. Apparently, her band mate went missing.\"\n\"Okay...\".\nJoseph piped up, \"Hey Mister King, whatchoo doin' here?\"\n\nHe didn't turn to look at them, continuing to stare into the darkness. \n\n\"You all don't remember much about that night, do you?\", he asked, dazedly.\n\"Uhhh, no...\", Joseph replied.\n\nBefore he could inquire into what his mentor meant, down the street they saw two vehicles drive up to the last warehouse. The first, a moving van, backed into the warehouse, while the second, a non-descript car pulled up outside and four men got out and entered the gun-metal grey building. \n\n\"Hey, Mister King, do you know them?\", Joseph asked.\n\nThe elder Malkavian was gone, having disappeared into the infinite curtains of shadow and city.\n\n\"Well, isn't that super spooky and mysterious\", J said in a very stupid and un-vampirically characteristic way because he doesn't appreciate dramatic moments or mood. \n\nRegardless, the group decided to investigate, and after entering what looked like an empty loading garage, they hopped into the bed of the moving van. Inside they found two black garbage bags. After tearing a gash in one of them, they were struck by the pungent smell of old blood and dead hitchhiker. Or at least, it was certainly dirty enough to have been a hitchhiker. Regardless, it wasn't Jessica Parker. Maybe she was in the inner warehouse, perfectly alive and unharmed.\n\nWhile Joseph 2, Lukans, and J had been examining, Joseph and London decided to go make friends. Walking into the warehouse, he caught one of the thugs supervising two lackeys dragging black bags toward a large hole in the side of the warehouse by surprise.\n\n\"Hello, comrade!\", Joseph cheerily exclaimed just before having a small hole form in his chest cavity as the guard put a slug into his chest, knocking him back on his ass. \n\nThe guard shouted to his companions who began opening fire. The rest of the coterie dashed over and began returning shots as London began trying to throw the closest thug into the ceiling and Joseph contemplated this breach of friendship. After a few exchanges between the two groups, three things became abundantly clear. First: Joseph had left and was calling an Uber to go home. Second: London's parkour skills had landed him straight through the glass pane of the warehouse's small office room, straight into one of two very panicked vampires. Third: Lukans's animalistic vision had seen something lurking in the depths of the giant hole, something that decided to reach out with a rope like tentacle and drag one of the remaining thugs screaming into the abyss. \n\nInto the lighting of the warehouse's overhead lights, attached to some surprisingly sturdy and walk able beams that could easily be traversed by someone wishing for a stealthy approach, say, by climbing up the ladder in the loading garage, stepped the creature. It looked crudely like an alligator or a crocodile, except made by a toddler with PlayDoh, and by PlayDoh, I mean human corpses fused, folded, and melded together by the world's most fucked up pre-schooler. It's arms, all six of them, looked like human arms and legs had been bundled together and twisted like a braid. It's body seemed to have been cobbled together from the torsos of many strangers, with a skin that seemed stretched to tightly over the spines and ribs underneath. It's mouth was filled not with teeth, but rows of jagged, broken bones, as well as several tentacles that flicked out, made from row after row of spine. Joseph 2 immediately ran to catch that Uber with Joseph.\n\nAs London beat the two vampires in the office into dust, J and Lukans began laying clip after clips into the Crocobomination, which is a very clever name that some people spent a lot of time thinking of. As J backed towards the doorway, the creature advanced, using it's spinal tentacles to pull him down and drag him into its gaping maw. Seeing this, a very wounded London rushed over and grappled the beast's jaw, allowing J to escape, and with Lukans, empty every piece of ammo they had on them into the Crocobomination's face. With a palpable sigh of relief, the three watched as the creature slumped into the floor and began melting into red and black ooze, which began dissolving into ash.\n\nGrabbing one of the computer's from the office room, J, Lukans, and London made their way back to the car where Joseph 2 and Joseph were patiently waiting. After cancelling the Uber, the coterie called Elijah Mandrell, Seattle deputy, Gangrel, and mentor to Lukans. \n\n\"I'm an hour across town. I'll be there in 15 minutes\", Mandrell said, hanging up. \n\"Well, that was rude\", said Lukans.\n\"Didn't you get it? Taylor was making a Pulp Fiction reference\", pointed out J.\n\"You mean, Elijah Mandrell made the reference\", said an omnipotent whisper of wind.\n\nAs promised, fifteen minutes expired and Mandrell stepped out from the shadows of a warehouse and walked over. After being briefed on everything that had occurred, by the coterie saying 'we brief him on everything we did', and taking possession of the computer, Mandrell thanked them for their hard work and told them to get fed, get some rest, and await a call from him in a week. As Mandrell left, Lukans was all, \"Kawaii senpai des~\".\n\nThe Third Part\n\nA week and a half later, on October 31st actually, because subtlety is overrated, the party - by which I mean Lukans, London, and Joseph - awoke to a voice mail from Elijah Mandrell requesting them to meet at the Seattle Space Needle because somebody wanted to have a dramatic fight scene on the top and then decided not to come because he has his head stuck up his own ass. One hour drive later - because everything in this city is exactly one hour away - the three arrived at the Space Needle. Standing next to several black SUV's were the five mentors of the coterie: Elijah Mandrel, the Gangrel deputy, Audrey Rousseau, the Toreador harpy, Angelina Strangelove, the Tremere regent, Kurt King, the Malkavian business magnate, and Michael Terry, the Nosferatu former-gangster. \n\n\"No need for introductions since all eight of us already know each other and have no need to reestablish our characters to each other\", Audrey intoned with a lilt.\n\"I suppose I can get you caught up on what has happened since the incident a week and a half ago. Thanks to the recovery of the computer from the warehouse, we were able to find the location of the Sabbat's main base of experimentation in Seattle and send in a far more competent taskforce to eliminate their 'pets', but unfortunately, the leader of Seattle's Sabbat, a one, 'Lord' Mikael Romanovski\n was able to escape to, you guessed it, the Space Needle! And now you need to go up there and kill him.\"\n\"So, if we're so incompetent, why haven't you done it\", Joseph asked prudently.\n\"Because you've already dealt with one of their creatures, silly\", Audrey soothed diplomatically.\n\"Because you're all expendable\", Michael Terry cackled.\n\"Also, because your other two friend already went up there and we haven't heard back from them\", Angelina Strangelove reminded.\n\"Don't worry though. We're not sending you in with just your peashooters\", Elijah Mandrell said, pointing at the back of the SUV Kurt King was leaning against.\n\nThe party went through the equipment: body armor, automatic weapons, and grenades, grabbing what they needed as Kurt King stared at them pointedly. \n\n\"Well, guys, let's head up\", Lukans said with a sigh.\n\nLoaded with enough firepower to take down an increasingly extravagant and elaborately designed creature, the party walked up the arbitrary number of steps to the observation deck of the building. The crew hadn't been to the Space Needle often during their stay in Seattle, but it definitely didn't look like this the last time they were there. Most of the floor, walls, and ceiling was either covered in blood or a weird, red and black thread that resembled spider webs. Nearby were web sacks made with the same thread dangling from the ceiling. Lukans cut one down and peeled away the web, revealing the face of a vampire, drained of blood and nutrients. Above them, they heard a soft scuttle. Lukans fired his AK-47 into the ceiling, pausing to listen for anything. \n\nDropping down from the ceiling behind them was the unsurprisingly obvious Spider Creature. None of the three seemed to care that it was anything besides a giant tarantula, despite how visually horrifying it was, like how it's carapace was made from dried blood coating the fused flesh of unfortunate Kindred or how it's eyes were actually dozens of screaming mouths filled with crimson eyes. The party's reaction was to try to soothe the beast with the gentle tunes of a rendition of Braddah Iz (no fucking joke). For their troubles, the Spider lunged. London dodged to the side out of the way, but Joseph got instantly enveloped by the creature's mandibles and turned into a chew toy for the rest of the fight. While bravely distracting the beast by being eaten alive, Joesph used his obscure skill of fortunetelling to see the immediate future of the creature which happened to be a fiery explosion, and was in no way a piece of foreshadowing.\n \nMeanwhile, London and Lukans had devised an outlandish scheme of pushing the Spider off the edge of the building.  Tying one end of rope around his waist, and the other end around the two of the Spider's legs, London flung himself off the balcony of observation deck. Unfortunately, neither London or Lukans had taken into account the physics of pulling a object four times your own weight by acting as a vampiric counter-weight. And after consulting a mechanical engineer which reinforced the infallibility of basic physics, the fight continued. \n\nLukans began pushing the beast towards the railing, while London swung himself towards the main pillars and Joseph tried to wear the beast down from the inside by dying aggressively. As Joseph felt his lower body get severed from his torso and suffer Final Death, he cursed the Masquerade and the establishment that had brought him here. Enraged by their friend's death, London pulled on the rope from above using the building's pillars as support while Lukans pushed from above. The Beast felt itself get dragged into the abyss below.\n\nAs it fell past him, London leapt after it. Locked in a mid-air grapple, the two hideous monsters battled to the last, mauling each other as they hit the ground. By the luck of god, or some might say, the roll of the dice, the Spider's squishy organs managed to cushion London's fall. Clinging to unlife, he sighed in relief as the Beast began to dissolve into bloody goo, which itself dissolved into dust, revealing a ticking black box. A black box with a hastily scrawled '&lt;3, from Zak', as the countdown hit 00:00. \n\nThe explosion nearly reached the waiting SUV's, instantly vaporizing London. Lukans looked on from above; helpless. With anger in his heart, Lukans renewed his search for his target, Lord Mikael, and his two remaining friends. Systematically, searching the web sacks on the observation deck, he discovered the ashy remains of Joseph 2, and the corpse of J, his spine snapped back and his head violently jammed into his own anus, right before he burst into ash. Finally, Lukans uncovered the face of Lord Mikael, barely conscious.\n\n\"Who did this to you?\", Lukans demanded.\n\"The real leader of the Seattle Sabbat. Z-\", he gasped, disintegrating into dust. \n\nDissatisfied with everything he'd learned, Lukans headed down the stairs to where the mentors were waiting. Most were surprised to see him alive, while Mandrell had a hint of pride in his stoic features. \n\n\"So, what happened?\", Audrey inquired.\n\"I found Mikael. He'd been attacked by that... thing. He said it'd been done by the real Seattle Sabbat leader. \n\nThe mentors conferred amongst themselves briefly before Elijah broke away to talk to his tutor privately. \n\n\"Now Lukans, it's very important that from here on out, you say that Mikael was the head of the Sabbat, and with his death, the Seattle Sabbat have been extinguished.\"\n\"But, what about my friends?! The real leader is out there and he needs to pay for their deaths!\"\n\"I know what you're feeling but it's important that we act from the shadows and give the Camarilla a well-needed victory. Lukans, I promise you, we'll find whoever did this to your gang and avenge them, but it's best for now that we don't let on that we're actively searching for whoever this leader is.\"\n\"Z. That's all Mikael managed to say.\"\n\"Z. Well, get home and rest. You'll need it in the coming months.\"\n\nFIN\n",

        "text": "I've been playing a new campaign since my last series of horrible stories (Ork Trader) ended. Same group, but now we're playing Shadowrun. The GM wanted to do something a little different, [so we did this](http://imgur.com/9P75QgN).\n\nAlso, this story is really lingo heavy, so I'll include a glossary at the bottom.\n___\n\n**The Crew**\n\n**Patches**: A former doctor, run out of business after failing to safe the life of an Ares higher up. He tries to keep our party in line, but tends to fail. Our cook.\n\n**Glib**: A streetsmart conman and card shark. Handles meetings for large shipments, and keeps the sec corps off our back. It doesn't always work. Very greedy, and addicted to gambling.\n\n**Shiv**: A jumped up street punk. History of heavy Kamikaze use. Our street man. Extremely violent.\n\n**C0D3 M0NK33**: Idiot savant decker. Has an unhealthy obsession with Urban Brawl, to the point of shooting someone who disagreed with his choice of team. Lacks any sort of impulse control. Oversees the manufacture of BTLs.\n\n**Wheels**: Greasy, smelly, uncouth, dwarf rigger. Runs the security at our safehouses. Generally unliked, but brings the heavy support.\n\n**Astra**: A hippy moon-child elf addicted to deepweed. Powerful mage, assuming you can hold her attention for long enough. Also runs our legitimate business, much to our horror.\n\n___\n\nOur GM throws us into Sydney, Australia. Our characters are all Shadowrunners that have worked together before (with the exception of Patches). Following a run that went bad, we were all cut loose by our fixers. Now we have no choice but to make it on our own. To that end, we recruited Patches, relying on his chemical knowledge to help us in the manufacture of drugs.\n\nOur first action is to acquire a legitimate storefront. We briefly debated putting it in Glib's name, but he \"lives the high life man. I can't be seen running a drekkin' Stuffer Shack.\" No one would sell to C0D3 M0NK33, Wheels, or Shiv, and Patches was trying to keep his hands as clean as possible, which only left Astra.\n\nNext, we looked into manufacturing. We knew we'd have to work our way up to kingpinning it for maximum profits, but until then, we had to focus on manufacturing to deliver to an intermediary distributor... or that's what Shiv said. He seems to know his stuff when it comes to drugs.\n\nBetween Patches' chemical knowledge, and C0D3 M0NK33's Google-Fu, they settled on manufacturing two types of drugs. Nitro, and BTL chips. Most of the stuff we needed to make Nitro was easy to get, but BTL's were going to be hard to manufacture, but very profitable if we can create exceptional experiences.\n___\n\nFirst, we decided to set up a laboratory for our Nitro manufacturing. Our GM described to us that Nitro manufacturing was a lot like the depiction of the drug manufacturing in Breaking Bad (which is where our group logo came from). Lots of fumes, big glass containers, and hazardous materials. We got our hands on the glass pretty easy, and even some of the chemicals, but we hit a snag. We required large quantities of Jazz and Cram.\n\nThe Jazz was easy to get, kinda. We ended up knocking over a Bush Ranger armory. Drove an armoured van through the side of the building, C0D3 M0NK33 hacked the door open and loaded the bags, while Shiv, Wheels and Glib fought off the arriving Bush Ranger forces. Astra was in the van. On the way over she decided to take some deepweed on the way over, and was now unconscious in the van, enjoying the pretty colours.\n\nThe Cram, we had to work out some shipment deals. Cram sells for 10 nuyen a dose, while Nitro sells for 50. We need one dose of Cram to make one dose of Nitro. Unfortunately, you can't just go to a street dealer and buy enough Cram to start a cartel, so we had to find a distributor. The street dealers weren't all to happy with us, but once Shiv showed them his \"friendly side\", they spilled the beans. Then it was just Glib actually being friendly, and we got ourselves a partnership. The first step to building our ~~MIGHTY DRUG EMPIRE~~, small time street business.\n\nWe had a few problems with the manufacturing process. Shiv, being a complete moron, went into the lab without a rebreather on, and almost died. Astra healed him, luckily. C0D3 M0NK33 invited a bunch of \"his buddies\" over to watch Urban Brawl, while Patches was cooking. Patches ruined a patch by adding Kamikaze instead of Cram. Glib still insisted we try to sell it, but Patches refused, saying it was a much more addictive and dangerous substance. This is why Patches doesn't handle our street deals.\n\n___\n\nAfter a couple days of cooking, dicking around, and generally making a nuisance of ourselves, Patches managed to get us about 800 doses of Nitro, for a total of 40,000 Nuyen worth of drugs. After subtracting the cost of the glassware, chemicals, and Cram costs, we came up to about 25,000 Nuyen. The only problem was distribution. The only person who understood the drug trade was Shiv, and he couldn't single handedly sling 800 units. We needed a distributor. Then the Gm ended the game.\n\n___\n\n**GLOSSARY**\n\n**Kamikaze**: A dangerous mix of pheromones and chemicals. When taken the user becomes incredibly strong, at the cost of a dangerous crash, severe addiction, and constant belief of true invulnerability and continuous hallucinations. Shiv has a severe addiction.\n\n**Urban Brawl**: A ~~Non~~-Lethal sport where the players are tasked to carry a ball into the enemy base. Cyberware, non-heavy weapons, and armour is permitted.\n\n**BTLs**: Stands for Better Than Life. A chip that can be implanted directly into the brain to create powerful emotions, hallucinations, or the belief that the user is another person, usually a celebrity. Extremely difficult to manufacture, and highly technical. The price increases based on the quality of the hallucination, with celebrities, pornography, and illegal actions being extremely valuable.\n\n**Deepweed**: Weed that forces viewers to see the astral plane.\n\n**Stuffer Shack**: 7-11.\n\n**Drek**: A curse/swear. Usually \"fuck\", but can be anything.\n\n**Nitro**: A mixture of kind of random chemicals and other drugs. Powerful stimulant, strong enough to kill a feeble user. Both physically and mentally addictive.\n\n**Jazz**: A stimulant used mostly by law enforcement to even the playing field against the generally more skilled shadowrunners.\n\n**Cram**: Stimulant that makes the user twitchy and paranoid.\n\n**Bush Rangers**: Our GM's homebrew all Australian security corporation.\n\n**Nuyen**: Universally accepted digital cryptocurrency.",

        "text": "**anyone currently playing a Doctor Who RPG campaign should check my username and then stop reading if I'm their GM**\n\nSo, I'm running a Doctor Who RPG campaign, and the Doctor and his companion are stuck on Earth and working for UNIT (again). The team that the Doctor and his companion were assigned to is made up of the four player's characters, The Doctor, his companion, and two ex-intelligence agents. However, to fill in a gap, I also added a pair of specialists – a biochem expert and a tech expert, named Benedict Simms (he goes by Simms) and Rielle (a name she picked for herself, as she preferred the Netrunner character's name to her own). Both characters are, in the words of a player, 'utterly adorkable'.\n\nAnyway, in the last story arc of the campaign, the PCs defeated the Black Guardian, a personification of chaos and entropy, and prevented the universe from being destroyed. In the same arc, one of the side adventures they went on involved the creation of a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence called the 'Overmind Living Intelligence', or 'OLI', for short, using a piece of lost Ancient Gallifreyan technology (A Gallifreyan Matrix Seed, designed to create any machine to a given purpose and modify it as-needed). The Black Guardian enlisted an anti-AI activist to release a nanorobot swarm within the facility while it was airgapped from the outside, so that he could prevent the AI from being given access to external systems and simultaneously discredit the AI. The players grew fond of the AI, but it ended up activating the EMP failsafe in order to save them, presumably destroying itself. However, the players failed to remember to retrieve the Matrix seed itself and check whether they AI had fled, and so the Black Guardian took the Gallifreyan Matrix Seed, complete with one Artificial Intelligence, for his own purposes.\n\nBack to the pairing of Rielle and Simms. Rielle is a computer and culture geek and hacker who found work for UNIT after gaining their attention by managing to hack alien technology. She's very intelligent, but can be unintentionally insulting and tactless and/or arrogant, and can sometimes seem aloof, though she's actually a caring person underneath and has been trying, with success, to change the aloofness ever since her best friend Simms called her out on it in the first adventure that the players had with UNIT. Simms is a biochem expert who hero-worships the Doctor, though he does his best to hide it, and is very kind and caring at surface as well as deep down. He became geek-culture savvy thanks to Rielle, who's dragged him through marathon after marathon of shows like Buffy and Star Trek, in addition to incessantly sending him TV Tropes links. He's fallen quite hard for Rielle, despite the fact that she doesn't really take that good care of herself, having near-constantly greasy hair due to lack of frequent showers with the reasoning that 'If I'm going to spend most of my time in the VR Lab anyway, what's the point?' However, while he wants to be in a relationship with her, she doesn't despite feeling some attraction to him, partly due to the fact that Rielle is quite insecure about herself and hasn't ever been in a relationship before, so she's worried she might screw everything up and would rather just stay best friends with Simms than risk that.\n\nIn a more recent encounter, the team (sans Rielle, who was attending DEFCON) went on vacation and were invited to a party at a wealthy philanthropist's beach home in the Bahamas. They attended, and a few drinks later, the host called all the guests together to give a speech – a speech that was promptly cut short by a simple shot through his heart. The party quickly morphed into a murder mystery, and one time shift, two team members becoming convinced they were characters from Sherlock Holmes (with other character's memories of their identities being suppressed, though they still thought them familiar), and an appearance of Sherlock Holmes later, the team realised that they were caught in a work of fiction. They managed to escape the fictional world by derailing the plot beyond repair (at which point all memories were restored), and became caught in a plane of static called the Netherscape, which would deposit them into a new fictional world if they walked far enough in another direction. A few heists later, and they gave Q (from Star Trek) the Infinity Gauntlet (from Marvel), resulting in all of the plots being derailed and the exit being revealed.\n\nThe team went through the exit, and were confronted by the Black Guardian, who thanked them for the most illuminating data that they'd given him through the simulation, which should be more than sufficient for his purposes. He revealed the true exit from the simulation to them, but told them that to sustain the simulation well enough for the team to exit, one would have to stay behind. Simms stayed behind, lying that he could see another exit, and the players exited the simulation.\n\nThey woke up to find themselves, drugged, wet, and groggy, in a quickly-draining tank. A pane of glass slid open, allowing them to exit, and they climbed out of the devices they'd been in, noting electrodes that'd been touching their heads while they lay in the tank. However, one of the tanks (the one with Simms) wasn't open. The Doctor checked the monitor and was relieved to see life signs, but noticed two things – the monitor read '**Simulation Link: ACTIVE** and was displaying a scrolling progress bar across the bottom, which said **COPYING NEURAL NETWORK**, then **MODIFYING PERSONALITY MATRIX WITH EXPERIENTIAL DATA AND OBJECTIVES**, then **COMPILING PERSONALITY MATRIX**, then  **TRANSFERRING MODIFIED PERSONALITY MATRIX TO GALLIFREYAN MATRIX SEED**, and finally **TRANSFER COMPLETE. CONNECTION TERMINATED**. The monitor went dark, and the tank containing Simms opened. He didn't open his eyes, but after a bit of poking, he woke up and sputtered, asking what happened and saying it felt like someone was hoovering up his brain. The players left the room they were in to try to find where they were, but to their surprise found themselves in the main room of the house, where the bullet-free host asked if they'd been enjoying themselves. They looked back for the door they came through, but it was gone.\n\n\nNow, a while later, long enough for both Rielle and Simms to become very important to the players, Director of Global Operations Alexander Goodwin was paying a visit to the state-of-the-art airborne base that the team were assigned to. Suddenly, while Rielle was demonstrating the new transmat function (currently set to transmat targets into the stasis holding cells on board the base) of the directed energy weapon-based pistol she was working on, which circumvented energy concerns by having a self-contained miniature neural-link based zero-point energy reactor that she'd only that day successfully reverse-engineered, the cloaked base came under attack by bogeys, which were quickly identified as military-grade drones of an unknown model or origin. The drones managed to penetrate the exterior of the base, and crashed themselves into the hole. The players went to investigate, only to find a swarm of small metal robots tearing their way down the hall toward the reactor core. By the time the team had destroyed them (with the assistance of badass grandpa Director Goodwin), the robots had managed to deal critical damage to it, triggering a failsafe measure that spent the energy reserves of the ship to use the ship's scavenged Quantum Overlay Drive to jump the ship to an abandoned underground UNIT facility. The team, sans Rielle, who'd put her lab in lockdown, and the pilot, who was missing, left the powerless ship, which'd used the last of its power reserves to jump-start the reactor core's self-repair routine. No sooner had they walked down the ramp than they came under attack by mobile robotic sentries. Half the team doubled back into the base to secure it and protect the Director. \n\nThe half of the team inside the base were unable to access the lab or find the pilot, and just as they were about to head out to rendezvous with the remaining half of the group, they were attacked by a person (presumably) in a sophisticated exosuit. Concentrating their fire on the lower chest of the figure, they managed to breach the exosuit, but when the concentrated laser rounds came in contact with the exposed skin, the skin began to glow orange with heat, and when it finally cooled down, it was left with a decidedly metallic tone. The suited figure looked down at its exposed lower chest and tilted its head curiously, then, almost in the blink of an eye, drew the experimental directed energy pistol from earlier and fired off three rounds, causing two of the players, along with the Director, to disappear in a flash of light. It happened so quickly that the players were told that they didn't feel anything until they suddenly didn't feel *anything*.\n\nMeanwhile, the team outside managed to fight their way through the robots, destroying them, and going down the one hallway that wasn't caved in. They made their way down and found an access terminal and an active reactor that was keeping the lights on. On examining the terminal, the Doctor found the plans for both the robots and the drones they'd faced. However, when he shut it down, he noticed something – the user was named 'OLI'. A look of panic crossed the Doctor's face and he said 'We have to get back to the ship. I just realised what's going on here, and we've got to warn the others!' Suddenly, the lights flickered, and Simms immediately hid inside an empty crate. When the lights came back on, the Doctor and his companion saw two figures coming from the hallway. Then they heard a slow clap. One of the figures stepped into the room, revealing themselves to be the Black Guardian.\n\n\nContinued in comments.",

        "text": "This story takes place very early on in Horde of the Dragon Queen and contains very minor spoilers therein. We have Brecknir, a dwarven thief and star of the story who may be the protagonist or antagonist depending on how you choose to look at it. We also have Wicket, a gnomish druid. Unrelated to the action at hand are Amber, a dwarven paladin, and Dumuzid, a tiefling warlock. Erol, the human cleric, stayed back at town.\n\nWe attempted to sneak into the camp of the Cult of the Dragon in disguise. As a charlatan, I used my disguise kit to make Brecknir look like a gnome, as he had pre-game dealings with the cult and was in danger of being recognized. Amber and Wicket put on Cult of the Dragon robes in an attempt to diguise themselves. I used my Mask of Many Faces invocation to magically alter my appearance. The three of us leashed Brecknir under the guise of having found him skulking around outside the camp and captured him, hoping to take him to the location of the other prisoners, which was our goal.\n\nThe plan failed miserably. The guards recognized Brecknir from the fight in Greenest the previous night. They seized him and Amber. Dumuzid, with his 19 Charisma, was able to bullshit his way out of detection. Wicket turned into a rat and scampered off. Half of the party was effectively captured.\n\nAs they're apprehending Brecknir, he attempts to keister a lockpick and manages to roll a natural 20. The DM rules that he was able to lodge the pick so far up his ass that the cult would require a proctologist to find it.\n\nBrecknir and Amber end up chained up with their wrists shackled, thus there was no way to remove the pick. Cue Wicket, still in rat form, who manages to shimmy up Brecknir's pantleg and go full Lemmiwinks, crawling into his ass to retrieve the pick. Wicket managed his checks not to vomit, Brecknir managed his checks not to scream out. The pick was acquired.\n\nThe problem was that Brecknir's wrists were shackled in place and Wicket had no lock picking skills. Brecknir had to hold the lock in his teeth in order to free himself. It took two attempts because he initially failed a constitution save and vomited due to the taste of his own ass.\n\nBrecknir was able to free himself and the other prisoners, then they high tailed it to the side of the camp where Dumuzid had lowered a rope for them to escape, having set a fire on the other side of the camp to distract the guards.\n\nMany long journeys later, Brecknir still has to make will saves any time he encounters rats or else he rolls at disadvantage.",

        "text": "Rising from bed, I check the time; about 10pm local. I'm still in a daze from the past week. Arriving in Kyrat to fulfil my mother's dying wish to return to Lakshmana - wherever *that* is - hasn't been easy. Without even crossing the border in country, our bus was accosted by the Royal Guard, who murdered at least 5 people in front of me, and almost killed Darpan and myself as well! \n\nUntil Pagan Min arrived...\n\nIt was obvious Min was unhappy about this. Shit, he stabbed one of the guards to death with what looked like *a damn gold 50. Cal bullet!* His eyes lit up as he saw me though; it appears he knew of me, *and* my mother. Even called me by name. Then Darpan and I were cuffed and blinded with a bag over our head, and whisked away to De Pleur's stronghold. \n\nI witnessed Darpan being exposed as a 'terrorist' from the 'Golden Path', and also witnessed him being tortured for information about the same group that saved my ass from Pagan's men and brought me back here to Banapur. Turns out my old man Mohan started the Golden Path, and they regard me - Ajay, son of Mohan Ghale - as a low-key Second Coming. Great. A scant few weeks ago, my biggest concern was if my bus was late to University, whilst wondering if I had time for Subway and Starbucks before class.\n\nAmita and Sabal from the GP have promised to help me lay my mothers ashes to rest as long as I help along the way. Apparently this 'Lakshmana' is believed to be *way* up north, deep in Pagan Min controlled territory. So I help the GP expand their influence, they help me get up north. Simple. \n\nAdmittedly, I'm doing things now I would never have dreamt of doing back in the states. It scares me how natural it feels now to hunt animals armed with little more than a bow and arrow. Never wasting them either; skinning them for the pelts, keeping the meat to distract tigers and bears if they get too close. A month ago I would have cleaned my hands thoroughly after handling raw steak for dinner. I don't think I've cleaned them properly once since I got here, aside from a a few times in a stale pool of water when the blood became too thick.\n\nAlso lost count of how many Royal Guard I've killed, yet I feel no remorse in doing so. I've seen what they have done to the Kyrati people. *My* people. In the short time here, it's become immediately apparent that Min is not the Light and Saviour of Kyrat as the propaganda broadcasts - and his own boasting - claim to be. Great delight is now taken in cleaning them from their 'Outposts', some poor village they have taken over, re-appropriating them as supply stops, repair stations and ad-hoc torture chambers. \n\nMy regular Merc Byron and I had just taken over an outpost nearby for the GP to claim, hence why I've been asleep for a solid 12 hours at least. This particular outpost had a mistreated elephant locked up behind what looked like an incredibly flimsy gate. It was obvious - to me, at least - that this magnificent, yet enraged pachyderm wanted to harm the RG, but just couldn't get out. \n\nAfter counting how many guards were present, and noting two off on patrol, a plan was formed. \n\nByron slinked through the low scrub to a cliff hidden in shadow that overlooked the Outpost. He brought his Recursive Bow, complete with marksman sights. That's all he needed. Myself, I kept to the shadows. Pressed up against a wall, I ducked my head around the corner. Here come the two patrolling RG, oblivious to my presence. \n\nA quick check in the other direction; no line of sight from the other 5 guards ambling about, so I scrambled across the wall. Stalking silently towards the sound of the Patrol, wall between us, I hear one grumbling about not seeing his family. *'Too late for that.'*, I thought.\n\nListening intently, judging that they had  walked past my position, I hop up onto the wall and follow them, now below me and to the left. 5 second window. I hold my breath, and drop down behind them. No reaction: they hadn't heard me yet. I take two quick steps forward. \n\nKukkri flashes out and bites home, driven down into his chest just under the larynx. Holding his thrashing body as a shield, I turn slightly to his slowly responding patrol partner. Like lightning, I've drawn my now limp victim's knife from his hip and thrown it, impacting the other guard directly in the eye. His head rocks back, and he drops without so much as a gurgle a second later. I *was* aiming for his chest, but no matter. They are both dead, and that's all that matters for now. \n\nI whistle, once. Byron aims his bow, draws the arrow, and fires. Perfect hit on the chain holding the gate closed. \n\nThe Elephant bursts out with a trumpeting bellow. Ducking it's head low, it stampedes straight into a RG truck, rolling it effortlessly across the street and into a ramshackle hut, collecting 2 guards in its path, one of whom was the driver. The other three open up with their AK's on the beast, but that just seems to piss it off. One tries to run, but the elephant snagged his leg and swung him mercilessly into the ground with a resounding splat. Clutching a club that was essentially a bag of meat barely contained in skin, the next guard fares no better from the animal. He sailed for a good 5 metres into the side of a building and crumpled to the ground. \n\nThe last guard runs for his life, throwing his weapon down and swearing all the way. I draw my own bow, line him up, and drop him from at least 30 metres, easy. \n\nByron comes sliding down the rocky incline. \n\n\"Well, that went well.\" \n\nI grunted in response, looking at the Elephant. He was standing still, head moving left and right as if surveying his work. It must have been satisfactory to him, for he quickly strode off the road and into the heavy thicket, not even sparing us a glance. I shake my head slightly, grin at Byron. \n\n\"That it did, that it did. Let's head in and have a look what we can find.\" \n\nA message came over the radio, congratulating us on liberating another Outpost, and that reinforcements will arrive soon to set it up as a GP supply stop. After rummaging around and finding quite a bit of hard currency - stolen from the locals, I wagered - I came across the gun that the coward had dropped in his flight. An old grenade launcher, rusty but workable. Making the trek back to Banapur, I thought to myself it will come in handy soon. Surveying the vista with appreciation of its natural beauty, I spy an ugly blemish off in the distance; one of the many Strongholds I expect I'll be storming in the future. \n\nYes. Very handy indeed.",

Mark was kneeling next to his head and had a knife in his hand.  The Halfling took his hand from the fighter’s mouth and tapped his ear.  Matt strained to hear what it was that Mark had awoken him for but didn’t detect anything.\n\n“Footsteps,” Mark whispered.  “In the hall.”\n\nA floorboard started to creak outside the room, but its pitch suddenly went back up as the foot was lifted off of it.  Matt pointed for Mark to awaken the sleeping cleric as he slowly rose to his feet.  The fighter silently drew his sword from his scabbard and stood between the other two and the door.  The doorknob shook gently as a hand grasped the other side.\n\nThe door clunked against the chair, and the innkeeper called out to them.  His tone carried a painful dissonance as if several voices were speaking through him.  \n\n“We know who you are.”  \n\nThe door slammed against the chair.  \n\n“We know what you’ve come for.”  \n\n*Slam.* Matt heard the chair start to splinter.\n\n“We know that you’ll die here.”\n\n*Slam.*  One of the legs gave way, and Matt drove his shoulder against the door, keeping it closed.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  The door shuddered as if struck by a heavy blow.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  The door began to break in the top hinge-side corner.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  John threw his own shoulder against the door, and the combined abuse proved to be too much for the wooden slab.  The fighter and cleric spilled into the hallway atop the door, pinning the innkeeper beneath their weight.  The possessed man’s hands snaked around the door, pawing at both of the two men.  \n\nMatt flinched as a throwing knife thudded into the wood just inches from his face.  “What the Hell are you doing?” he shouted at the Halfling.\n\n“Sorry!” Mark yelled back.  “I was trying to pin his hand against the door.”\n\n“Don’t throw knives! Just stab him,” John yelled.\n\n“He’s like three times my size!  I’m not getting that close!”\n\nThe innkeeper drew his hands back under the door and bellowed as he threw the door off of him.  Matt and John tumbled over one another and scrambled to their feet.  The innkeeper scooped the massive smithy maul from the ground and held the tremendous weapon in one hand.  He took a step backwards to ensure that Mark couldn’t flank him from the door and readied himself for their charge.\n\nMatt and John exchanged a look, and Matt just shook his head with wide eyes.  *No way in Hell am I going to trade blows with that guy,* the look read.  John nodded and lifted the amulet emblazoned with the symbol of his god high above his head.\n\n“Creature of the dark, by the power of Ra, I exorcise thee!” the cleric roared.  A beam of light short forth from the amulet and struck the innkeeper in the head.  \n\nThe innkeeper coughed up black ichor and shuddered, but the giant man kept his feet, although dazed.  Mark darted around the corner and hurled another knife at the man.  This throw struck true and nicked an artery in the innkeeper’s neck.  Dark blood sprayed the wall, and the he clamped a hand over the wound to stem the loss of blood.\n\nMatt sprinted down the hall and crashed into the innkeeper.  He bowled the off balance man over and tumbled downstairs as the retractable staircase opened beneath them.  \n\nJohn ran over to the staircase and saw black hands reaching around the stairs toward the heap.  The cleric lifted his amulet again, and a beam of warm sunlight bathed the stairs.  Smoke hissed from the monstrous arms and a shriek rose from the monsters as they retracted their hellish appendages.  \n\nMatt disentangled himself from the innkeeper.  His longsword had become embedded in the big man’s chest all the way to the hilt.  The fighter planted a foot on the man’s chest and yanked his sword free.  He scrambled back up the stairs, but they didn’t swing closed behind him.\n\n“Weeee knoooowww,” the innkeeper moaned.  He seemed to be barely clinging onto consciousness, but he had an arm firmly planted on the stairs, keeping them from closing.  “Sstill a loong night ahead.  Can you brave the night?”\n\nDrops of sweat had begun to bead on John’s forehead, and the strain of maintaining the beam of sunlight was beginning to strain him.  “Can’t keep this up much longer,” he muttered.\n\n“We are commming for you,” the innkeeper groaned.  More reaching hands appeared in the shadows around the beam of light.\n\nMatt nodded.  He scrambled back down the stairs, and with two sure swings, severed the man’s arm at the shoulder.  The stairs closed behind him as soon as he stood on the floor in the second story hallway.  Mark darted past the two humans and began to claw at the stairs.\n\nThe stairs began to swing downward and Matt shouted at the Halfling.  “Are you trying to let them in?  Get off the damn stairs!”\n\nThe Halfling pulled a knife and began digging at his feet with it.  The stairs began to swing down faster.  “I need to cut the rope!” Mark screamed.\n\n“Shit,” Matt and John said simultaneously.  Both the men ran to the small ledge on either side of the stairs and lifted with all their might.\n\n“Hurry,” John groaned.  The muscles in Matt’s shoulders and neck stood out like cords as he fought the losing tug-of-war.\n\n“I’m not taking my sweet fucking time!”  Mark glanced around for something he could use that may help and his eyes fell on the innkeeper/baker/artificer/blacksmith’s maul.  He slammed his knife into the top of the knot and strained to lift the maul from the ground.  The Halfling slung the giant hammer onto his shoulder, narrowly missing the clerics face in the process.  With a shout, he slammed the hilt of the knife into the knot with the maul, driving it clean through the knot and the floor.\n\nThe retractable stairs banged back into place, and the three adventurers panted in exhaustion.  They all stood ready for the stairs to start swinging down again.  Several minutes passed, and they slumped down to the floor.  \n\n“Damn it,” Mark snapped.\n\n“What?” Matt said, tightening the grip on his sword.\n\nThe Halfling looked at the fighter.  “That was my favorite knife!”\n\n[Link to the Next Part](http://redd.it/2ruc66)",

His tone carried a painful dissonance as if several voices were speaking through him.  \n\n“We know who you are.”  \n\nThe door slammed against the chair.  \n\n“We know what you’ve come for.”  \n\n*Slam.* Matt heard the chair start to splinter.\n\n“We know that you’ll die here.”\n\n*Slam.*  One of the legs gave way, and Matt drove his shoulder against the door, keeping it closed.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  The door shuddered as if struck by a heavy blow.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  The door began to break in the top hinge-side corner.\n\n“We know.”\n\n*Slam.*  John threw his own shoulder against the door, and the combined abuse proved to be too much for the wooden slab.  The fighter and cleric spilled into the hallway atop the door, pinning the innkeeper beneath their weight.  The possessed man’s hands snaked around the door, pawing at both of the two men.  \n\nMatt flinched as a throwing knife thudded into the wood just inches from his face.  “What the Hell are you doing?” he shouted at the Halfling.\n\n“Sorry!” Mark yelled back.  “I was trying to pin his hand against the door.”\n\n“Don’t throw knives! Just stab him,” John yelled.\n\n“He’s like three times my size!  I’m not getting that close!”\n\nThe innkeeper drew his hands back under the door and bellowed as he threw the door off of him.  Matt and John tumbled over one another and scrambled to their feet.  The innkeeper scooped the massive smithy maul from the ground and held the tremendous weapon in one hand.  He took a step backwards to ensure that Mark couldn’t flank him from the door and readied himself for their charge.\n\nMatt and John exchanged a look, and Matt just shook his head with wide eyes.  *No way in Hell am I going to trade blows with that guy,* the look read.  John nodded and lifted the amulet emblazoned with the symbol of his god high above his head.\n\n“Creature of the dark, by the power of Ra, I exorcise thee!” the cleric roared.  A beam of light short forth from the amulet and struck the innkeeper in the head.  \n\nThe innkeeper coughed up black ichor and shuddered, but the giant man kept his feet, although dazed.  Mark darted around the corner and hurled another knife at the man.  This throw struck true and nicked an artery in the innkeeper’s neck.  Dark blood sprayed the wall, and the he clamped a hand over the wound to stem the loss of blood.\n\nMatt sprinted down the hall and crashed into the innkeeper.  He bowled the off balance man over and tumbled downstairs as the retractable staircase opened beneath them.  \n\nJohn ran over to the staircase and saw black hands reaching around the stairs toward the heap.  The cleric lifted his amulet again, and a beam of warm sunlight bathed the stairs.  Smoke hissed from the monstrous arms and a shriek rose from the monsters as they retracted their hellish appendages.  \n\nMatt disentangled himself from the innkeeper.  His longsword had become embedded in the big man’s chest all the way to the hilt.  The fighter planted a foot on the man’s chest and yanked his sword free.  He scrambled back up the stairs, but they didn’t swing closed behind him.\n\n“Weeee knoooowww,” the innkeeper moaned.  He seemed to be barely clinging onto consciousness, but he had an arm firmly planted on the stairs, keeping them from closing.  “Sstill a loong night ahead.  Can you brave the night?”\n\nDrops of sweat had begun to bead on John’s forehead, and the strain of maintaining the beam of sunlight was beginning to strain him.  “Can’t keep this up much longer,” he muttered.\n\n“We are commming for you,” the innkeeper groaned.  More reaching hands appeared in the shadows around the beam of light.\n\nMatt nodded.  He scrambled back down the stairs, and with two sure swings, severed the man’s arm at the shoulder.  The stairs closed behind him as soon as he stood on the floor in the second story hallway.  Mark darted past the two humans and began to claw at the stairs.\n\nThe stairs began to swing downward and Matt shouted at the Halfling.  “Are you trying to let them in?  Get off the damn stairs!”\n\nThe Halfling pulled a knife and began digging at his feet with it.  The stairs began to swing down faster.  “I need to cut the rope!” Mark screamed.\n\n“Shit,” Matt and John said simultaneously.  Both the men ran to the small ledge on either side of the stairs and lifted with all their might.\n\n“Hurry,” John groaned.  The muscles in Matt’s shoulders and neck stood out like cords as he fought the losing tug-of-war.\n\n“I’m not taking my sweet fucking time!”  Mark glanced around for something he could use that may help and his eyes fell on the innkeeper/baker/artificer/blacksmith’s maul.  He slammed his knife into the top of the knot and strained to lift the maul from the ground.  The Halfling slung the giant hammer onto his shoulder, narrowly missing the clerics face in the process.  With a shout, he slammed the hilt of the knife into the knot with the maul, driving it clean through the knot and the floor.\n\nThe retractable stairs banged back into place, and the three adventurers panted in exhaustion.  They all stood ready for the stairs to start swinging down again.  Several minutes passed, and they slumped down to the floor.  \n\n“Damn it,” Mark snapped.\n\n“What?” Matt said, tightening the grip on his sword.\n\nThe Halfling looked at the fighter.  “That was my favorite knife!”",

        "text": "I'm DMing a Forgotten Realms campaign based around the story that a drow house from Undrek'Thoz falls hardcore, and its survivors and surviving retainers flee into the Underdark.  Those survivors are, obviously, the PCs.  We had a series of ridiculous mishaps during a single encounter last session, so I figured I would share.  The cast is as follows:\n\n* **Kokoth**, a drow cleric of Selvetarm, last actual surviving noble member of the fallen house, who has just revealed that he doesn't worship Lolth and caused significant clash with the group's wizard.\n* **Jarvyll**, a drow conjurer and proper worshiper of Lolth, who is more or less a battle captive to Kokoth's family and is along for the ride via guilt by association with the house that adopted him.  He really just would like to go home to *his* house.\n* **Reopro**, a drow arcane trickster from Menzoberranzan who, houseless, was absorbed into the drow house in Undrek'Thoz and promptly nicknamed \"Bait.\"\n* **Khaegar**, a mountain dwarf battle raging mercenary hired by Jarvyll as a bodyguard.  Khaegar is not actually very good at bodyguarding.\n* **Gunthur**, a svirfneblin thief who was pressganged into the party when they happened across him in the Underdark, because he had some pretty useful skills and wasn't given the option to say \"no thanks.\"\n* **Jandar**, a human hunter who has made his living in the Underdark by hunting down beasties for spell components, on hire as a retainer to the drow house that fell and unfortunate enough to be present during the attack and therefore obliged to run away.\n\nThe party has spent several weeks in the Underdark now, somehow surviving and even managing to thrive (sort of) in the sense that they haven't had trouble finding sources of food and water, magical or otherwise.  They decide to return to one of the segments of Undrek'Thoz to try to set up a mercenary band, because Reopro met Jarlaxle once and is now a massive, unapologetic fanboy and they all figure Reopro's idea is more attractive than spending the rest of their lives out in the dismal reaches of the Underdark.  While traveling north they come across a dead end tunnel that runs perpendicular to a wide, slow-moving subterranean river deep enough that the bottom can't be seen about four feet away from the shore.  They can see a distant cavern shore downriver, but no land between where they stand and where they want to go.  Fortunately for them a very large tangle of debris has collected in a pile near the river bed, half-submerged, where things have washed up on shore and gotten trapped against the stone wall where the cavern cuts north.  Underneath and amidst this debris they find a boat with a hole in the hull but enough relatively-intact petrified mushroom boards that they figure they can fix it.\n\nThey set a watch and spend a couple of hours attempting to make this boat seaworthy and eventually decide they've got it \"good enough\" for the distance they have to go, which they figure to be about an hour's worth of travel.  Jarvyll casts *phantom steed* and summons a manatee, which is promptly harnessed to the boat.  All of this is all well and good and they set out from shore, heading against the current northwards towards their destination.  Everything seems to be *finally* working out for them, but about forty minutes into the otherwise pleasant boat ride, Reopro gets the unfortunate experience of being grabbed from below by the bloated, hideous corpse of a drow elf lurking beneath the waters of the river.  While he grapples with the thing everyone else becomes aware that the boat has stopped, because there are about a dozen more zombies now grabbing onto it and arresting its movement while two at the front are mangling their poor summoned manatee, which they fail to protect and which is unsummoned once it takes damage.\n\nFortunately, these zombies don't turn out to be too difficult to dispatch and Reopro is slippery enough to get himself disentangled from the one trying to drag him into the water.  *Un*fortunately, the zombies are swarming up from under the water about as quickly as the party can kill them.  Kokoth starts channeling divinity like a boss and zombies are exploding everywhere around the group, which just makes room for *more* zombies, and Jarvyll takes a couple of heavy hits which pleases him about as much as the earlier theological discussion he had with aforementioned cleric.  To make things worse, when stabbing (and indeed slaying) one of the zombies that has managed to climb aboard the boat and attack the group up close, Jandar manages to rupture a cystic mass on the thing and splatters everyone standing nearby with rancid zombie pus.  Considering this is a small boat, *everybody is nearby*.  Jarvyll is having a very bad day.\n\nIn an effort to be helpful Gunthur stabs at one of the zombies still in the water off the back of the boat, since he's been manning the tiller.  He grossly overshoots his assault and ends up tumbling overboard to make some new zombie friends and gets hit in the head a couple of times by the now-drifting boat.  Fortunately for him, Khaegar succeeds at bodily lifting the errant gnome out of the water and tossing him back aboard the boat.  Kokoth blasts another turn undead and, finally, they manage to dispatch the rest of the zombies.  The party unhappily starts to reorient itself, covered in zombie gore, one of them soaked, and Jandar and Khaegar both try to get things underway again.\n\nAt this point, Khaegar rolls a 1 to try to pilot the boat properly.  As a DM, I believe in critical failures as much as critical successes.  The rest of the party looks on in horror.  Khaegar rolls another 1.  The boat capsizes.\n\nKokoth is wearing plate mail armor.\n\nWhile the rest of the group is panicking in the water and Kokoth is sinking, Jarvyll reacts quickly and makes use of his house symbol, *levitating* himself straight up and out of the water.  Kokoth catches on and manages to save himself by doing the same, denying me the opportunity to outright drown a PC.  Everyone else manages to succeed at the task of at least treading enough water not to be swept downriver or drown, but now the two noble drow are just kind of hovering above the river while the rest of the party and their vessel is being pulled away from them by the current, and they're still twenty minutes away from the shore by boat.  Kokoth has no hope of managing to swim that distance in plate mail and Jarvyll is no Michael Phelps, so they're obligated to try to save the *iblith*.\n\nAfter some tense and brisk arguments during which the boat gets significantly further away from the spot the two drow are *levitating*, the rest of the party manages to kick against the current well enough to get the boat back underneath the party leaders, and they have Kokoth just drop down onto one side of it while the folks in the water shove hard against the other side from beneath to get it upright again, catching Kokoth and dragging him in before he can fall into the water again.  Jarvyll descends into the boat and begins the ritual to summon back his manatee, by which point the boat is the equivalent of twenty minutes downriver again since they've lost their makeshift oars.  They crankily proceed, this time without incident.\n\nBy time they make landfall again they have, to a man, decided that Khaegar isn't allowed to touch anything anymore.",

        "text": "I was running a (slightly silly) mini-campaign in ORE:Reign in a setting of my own creation with a few friends of mine. Despite being only 3 sessions, somehow the last session ended up with only two players \"turning up\" (we did it by Skype). But I digress...\n\nThe plot was simple. The players were approached by a mysterious foreigner and offered a considerable reward for stealing an ancient tome from some monks. They're pretty sure the guy's evil as hell but he's rich. The book proved more heavily guarded than expected but they stole it and got paid handsomely. Then they did a few more tasks for the man (including intimidating a pirate captain) before he could do the ritual with the book.\n\nSo the guy made himself the God of Life, allowing him to control all living things, including the PCs. However, one of the PCs was a mage in service to a god and this god didn't want the new god to get far so he interfered with the ritual to make both of the PCs gods too. So they become the gods of War and Change and end up in a confrontation in the spiritual plain.\n\nExcept the God of Life is immortal. He can't be destroyed, only subdued. So Change opens up a bottomless pit, manifests testicles on the god of Life and War kicks him in them and pushes him into the pit, saving the world from oppression by a new tyrannical deity.\n\nThe players then return to the physical plane and go to the pub, ignoring any kind of cosmological matters.",

It is my duty to welcome my Lord back into the world with the birth of every day.”\n\n“I see,” the Halfling said as he looked at the slowly lightening horizon.  \n\nJohn closed his eyes and began to focus his mind in preparation for the sunrise.  \n\n“I’m Mark.”\n\nThe Cleric cracked open an eye and looked at Mark.  “I’m John,” he said and returned to the beginning of his meditation.  \n\n“I just wanted to say I’m sorry for sneaking into the back of the cart.”\n\nJohn took a deep breath and sighed.  “It’s all right,” he said, turning to look at the Halfling.  “I’m sure you had your reasons.”  The Cleric centered himself for the third time and began concentrating.\n\n“I-” Mark started.\n\n“He’s trying to meditate.  Stop distracting him,” Matt said from behind them.\n\n*Thank you,* John thought.  \n\n“Oh, crap, sorry.”  \n\nThe next several minutes passed in silence as the sun slowly crested the horizon, and John felt the warmth of his God’s power flow into him.  *Thank you Great Ra for this day you have given us…*\n\nMatt took the reins from Mark and let the Halfling rest in the back while he drove them the rest of the way to the small village.  The three traveled in relative silence through the rest of the day and arrived in the town of Sarl an hour before sunset.  They watched as several places shuttered windows, and Mark noted that there were small gouges in the walls and windowsills of many of the homes.\n\n“It’s amazing where traveling through the night will get you,” Mark said as he hopped down from the bed of the cart.\n\n“Yeah,” Matt said.  “We should find a place to rest and begin our investigation in the morning.  There should be an inn just ahead.”  They went a few hundred more yards and pulled to a stop in front of a two-story building.  Heavy shutters blocked out any light from making it outside, and it took several loud knocks before someone came to the door.\n\n“Who’s there?” a gruff voice called from beyond the threshold.\n\n“I am from the Church of Ra in Holden,” John answered.  “We’ve come to help with the strange occurrences that have been happening.”\n\n“How many of you are there?”\n\n“Two.  And a half,” Matt answered with a smirk.\n\n“Hey!” Mark squeaked.  \n\n“Very well.”  The sound of bolts being thrown back and chains being removed came from inside the inn.  After several very long moments, the door swung outward, catching all three men off guard.  Mark nimbly jumped back, dodging the door, but John would have been struck in the face were it not for Matt catching the heavy wooden slab.\n\n“Oh, my apologies,” the innkeeper, a beast of a man with thick muscles and dark hair in stark contrast to the pink apron he wore, said.  “We had to reverse the doors and reinforce the frames or else *they* would be able to get inside.”\n\n“And who are they?” John asked as they walked inside.\n\nThe innkeeper was silent as he shut the door and began throwing all the bolts and latching chains.  He lowered several cross beams into place.  “I’m Bruce Smith,” he said, offering his hand out to John, “town artificer, blacksmith, baker, and inn keep.”\n\n“That’s quite a few hats you wear,” Matt said.\n\n“More like quite a few aprons,” Bruce said.  He then started to laugh so hard he nearly reduced himself to tears.  The Fighter and the Rogue shared a curious look as the man’s laughter seemed to go on and on.  \n\nBruce let out a wheeze and caught his breath.  “Sorry about that.  There’s not much call for laughter anymore, not since the Carters and the Fletchers went missing.”\n\n“Now, you mentioned that *they* would be able to get inside.  Who are they?” Matt asked, echoing John’s earlier question.\n\n“Don’t know,” Bruce said, looking down at the Halfling.  “We just know that they come in the night and are gone in the morning.”\n\n“And do they cause those scratches on the outsides of the houses?” Mark asked.\n\nBruce nodded.  He opened his mouth to speak, but his face paled and he turned his head to the side.\n\n“Are you-” John started to say before Bruce interrupted him.\n\n“Shh!  They’re coming,” he whispered.  “Be here any minute.  Have to stay quiet, or they’ll beat the doors and windows in to get at us.”\n\nAt that moment, the sound of ghostly whispers began to bleed through the walls, and all three men had to shake themselves out of the primal fear it dredged up from the dark recesses of their minds.  \n\n“What about our cart?” Mark asked.\n\n“And our horse?” Matt added.\n\nThe big man, jovial before, began to wring his hands nervously as he failed to suppress a shudder.  “They cart’ll be fine.  They don’t take things.  But the horse…”\n\nA panicked whiney came from outside, and Matt rushed to the door.  He had lifted only one of the four crossbeams when a heavy slam made the door shudder in its frame.  The horse’s shriek was clipped short, and there came a wet slap from outside, like someone had dropped something heavy and wet on the ground.  The door shuddered again, and Bruce helped Matt put the crossbeam back in place.\n\n“Too late now,” Mark whispered.\n\nMatt nodded, and Bruce led them to the end of a hallway where a rope hung down from the ceiling.  He pushed the three against the wall and pulled down on the rope.  A wooden panel swung down, and stairs were mounted to the other side.  Springs supported the entire contraption, making it easier to raise and lower.\n\nBruce beckoned the three up the stairs and followed behind.  He lifted the stairs back up and pulled the rope up from their side.  Matt surmised that it would make getting up to the second floor nearly impossible.\n\n“We can talk up here,” Bruce said, his voice soft.\n\n“What’s going on?” John asked.  “Why do you have a trapdoor staircase?”\n\n“Well, that’s the thing,” Bruce explained.  “When the things first came, the only one who survived from the houses that were attacked was a little girl who had been lifted up to the rafters by her father.  She’s the only one who’s seen ‘em.”\n\nThere was a crash from downstairs, and the innkeeper sighed.  Mark noted the change in his demeanor as odd, but the Halfling noticed that the whispers were nearly inaudible from the middle of the second story.  “Sounds like one of the windows gave way.”\n\n“Are we safe up here?” Matt asked, lowering his hand to his sword in preparation for a fight.\n\n“We’re fine.  They get in from time to time, but they’re always gone by morning.  I’ll just have to clean up after their gone.  You three may use any of the rooms up here except that one,” Bruce said, pointing a huge thumb over his shoulder.  “That room is mine.”\n\nMatt handed the innkeeper a few coins from his pouch.  “Thank you.  Is there any way we could meet with the girl in the morning?”\n\nBruce nodded.  “She stays with the priest at his home,” the innkeeper said.  “But I don’t know if you’ll be able to get anything out of her.  She doesn’t talk anymore.”\n\n“I need to meet with the priest,” the Cleric said.  “I’ll see if there’s anything I can do for the girl while we’re there.”\n\n“As you will,” Bruce said as he turned around and opened the door to his room.  “There’s nothing to be done now that they’re inside.  I’ll see you gentlemen in the morning.”\n\n“Uh, all right,” Matt said to the man’s back.\n\nAs soon as the door to the innkeeper’s room closed, Mark opened his mouth to speak, but Matt placed his hand over it and shook his head.  He pointed at the room diagonally across the hall from the innkeeper’s and drew his sword silently.  The Fighter slowly opened the door and surveyed the room before entering.  He confirmed there were no visible threats and sheathed his sword, motioning the others to come inside.\n\nAs soon as the Rogue and Cleric entered, he closed and braced a chair against the door.  “Something strange is going on,” Matt said.  “How long did the church say this has been going on for these people?”\n\n“Only a few days,” John answered.\n\nMark raised his hand, and the two Humans looked at him.  “I don’t remember seeing any signs that there had once been a stairway, and there were no drill holes on the interior side of the doorframe from when a door had swung inward.”\n\nMatt gave the Halfling a surprised look.  “That’s some impressive attention to detail you’ve got there half-pint.”\n\nMark crossed his arms and frowned at the man.  “You know, I’ve heard *all* of the short jokes.”\n\nJohn just rolled his eyes.  “The way I see it, we have to stay in here until daybreak.  It seems to me that the town is most likely overrun with some kind of monsters that only come out at night.  To me, that screams undead.  The innkeeper’s behavior is… odd, but maybe he’s just not holding up well under the pressure.”\n\n“That could be,” Matt said.  “Still, I think we should take shifts to make sure nothing screwy goes on tonight.”  John and Mark immediately agreed.  \n\nWatch schedule agreed upon, the three settled in for the night.\n\n[Link to Next Part](http://redd.it/2ricpd)",

        "text": "Suffice to say it was a Homebrew called Irregulars, based on Sherlock Holmes. The players were Baker Street Irregulars (the street kids Holmes used to get to do little errands to help him with his investigations) only it's been 15 years since those days, Holmes is gone from the scene (he went missing in '91) and we've all grown up. I played John Jones (probably an alias), a man trying and failing to distance himself from his criminal past (it was mostly his family that did the crime but whatever)\n\nAt the ripe age of 24, John Jones now owns a pub in Greenwich (totally through hard work and diligence, not through blackmail) and now runs it completely legitimately, never doing any smuggling ventures or helping British spies sabotage foreign anarchist bombers. Not at all. He employs Jack, one of the weedier Irregulars from the old days (someone's gotta keep him alive).\n\nNovember, 1894, Nelson Williams enters the pub asking for help on what sounds like it could be a mystery from the old days. Frenchmen turning up dead every day on the streets of Camden. No one knows who they are, why they're being killed or who's doing it (but this is all only tangentially linked to the fate of my pub). John clues in Jack, who promptly provokes one french patron and his friend into attempting to beat him bloody. Being a PC, Jack flattens them both. The frog takes a bottle to his face and collapses, the friend flees the scene. John attempts to help the man along but is only able to get the name of his friend - \"Arkwright\" - before the man becomes the latest murder (poison dart to the face).\n\nHonesty Williams (brother of Nelson and famously and ironically known for his lies) is tasked with infiltrating the Club Autonomie to find the anarchist angle on the murders. He bumps into Arkwright and accidentally (or so he says) becomes part of a plan to instigate a coup d'état on John's pub (because some anarchists are just nutters who don't know that you're meant to destroy governments, not replace them). The date of the coup is planned (none of the players are sure why everyone goes along with it. It barely relates to the investigation) and the police and John's pub regulars and both tipped off.\n\nJohn, Nelson and everyone but Jack and Honesty were indisposed at the time of the great pub brawl and Honesty left as soon as it started so Jack is the only real witness to events. Suffice to say, the \"anarchists\" were defeated but **someone** (probably Jack) thought it would be a good idea to set fire to some spirits on the bar and before long the roof went up.\n\nJohn came back from his adventures with a valuable (as in he was gonna sell it) list of conspirators and in receipt of a decent insurance payment on the pub, so he was well set, but he was a dick to Jack about it anyway.",

        "text": "So no shit, there we were, a session of d&amp;d \n\nI played the xenophobic homebrew paladin that was all about humanity. And nothing else. (Chaotic neutral paladin)\n\nOne of us was a female half-elf ranger.\n\nAnd the last was a halfling bard.\n\nAnd this is how we wrecked a campaign in one session:\n\nWe started out as a team that had been hired to track down a paladin of the same brotherhood as my character, now turned evil and raising undead and doing other nefarious things.\n\n\nThe first incident in the cathedral undercroft involved us all failing to disarm a trap. However the trap would teleport two random enemies in front of us.\n\nSo soon after, our level 1-2 characters are faced with four orks and a warboss.\n\nWhile my paladin is rarin to kill some filthy xenos, the bard steps in.\n\nAnd by some miracle manages to make the orks think that he is an aspect of their god.\n\nThen just to mess with me, the DM adds them to the party.\n\nThe bard then uses the orks to smash his way into an ancient crypt, and accidentally awakens a 200 year old lich.\n\nOne of the orks manages to remove an arm from the lich, but gets obliterated and we leave.\n\nWe rest and the next day the dm tells us that now, in addition to the undead besieging the city, the lich and his minions are now rampaging through.\n\nSo we decide it's best to leave.\n\nOn our way to the last supposed sighting of the BBEG we run into three cultists. \n\nThe paladin breaks heads and intimidates the surviving cultist into spilling the beans.\n\nWhile he does that we get jumped by a group of zombies.\n\n\nThe bard promptly climbs a tree, and pulls out an urn he stole from the undercroft and drops it on the zombies.\n\nTurns out this urn is basically full of a magical version of alchemists fire.\n\nTl:dr everything is  now on fire. Including the cultist about to tell us everything.\n\nPaladin wades in like a badass and starts killing,\n\nThe ranger crit fails a dagger throw and manages to get it stuck in the paladins helmet.\n\nThe bard crit fails his escape from the burning tree and lands in the center of the pack of zombies, on fire.\n\nThe orks in the meantime are occupied fighting an undead ogre according to the DM\n\nThe paladin manages to save the bard, hauling him out at 1 hp. And throwing him at the ranger. \n\nWith the undead handled, now the entire forest is on fire, the paladin is pissed off, the bard is nearly dead and the ranger literally didn't roll a non crit fail the entire fight.\n\nSo we leave and talk our way into the next town. ( kinda difficult with four huge orks in tow)\n\nWe rest and relax while the bard tries to keep his orks from doing ork things.\n\nWe go to the local chapel to try and piece together some clues. Get attacked by cultists and the dm reveals that  the ornate daggers we kept finding on them are a suicide method in case of capture.\n\nSo the paladin throws one of the daggers   At a cultist.\n\nThe cultist FUCKING EXPLODES,\n\nNow suddenly the other cultists are like WTF\n\nThe local priest is like, WHY IS THERE HUMAN ALL OVER MY CHURCH\n\nthe ensuing fight results in the church on fire, the bard claiming a cat, then convincing the orks it IS their god. The ranger accidentally killing a priest and a goat and the paladin making squishy piles out of the cultists with his warhammer. And the orks smashing cultists with church pews.\n\n\nThe dm has us go back to the inn and wait for a contact to approach us, because instead of finding our next lead, we destroyed half the town by accident.\n\nSo in walks two elves.\n\nDid I mention my paladin was a xenophobe?\n\nSo I promptly smash the first elf in the face with my barstool.\n\nNAT FUCKING 20\n\nThe elf is now twitching on the ground with a barstool leg in his neck, and the other elf gets beat to death with a tankard. \n\nDuring this the bard went and fetched some guards.\n\nA few intimidate checks later (easier with four huge orks to back you up) and we are running out of town.\n\nThe dm, in one last attempt has us meet a traveling merchant.\n\nWho happens to be a dwarf.\n\nThe bard tries to use a song to convince him to tell us about the BBEG.\n\nBut of course\n\nNAT FUCKING 1\n\nThe dm states: \"your song is so terrible and the magic you weave into your voice is too powerful, the dwarf promptly jams a dagger into his ear, killing him instantly\"\n\nRanger tries to loot his cart, fumbles the roll and manages to drop a jar of alchemists fire on the cart. \n\nAfter we put the ranger out, the fire burnt into some poison causing a great toxic cloud to form.\n\nWe moved on, and met a traveling elf wizard.\n \n\nScant minutes later the elf is a pile of gore with a wizards hat on.\n\nThe dm holds his head in his hands, gets up, and goes outside for a smoke.\n\n\nAfter that the session ended.",

        "author": "dysanic",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2qybdp/pathfinder_rotrl_my_best_and_worst_gaming_session/",
        "text": "I want to preface this by saying that we've just barely made it past the glassworks in Rise of the Runelords (Burnt Offerings), so there will be spoilers associated with the first several sessions of that particular adventure path.\n\nSome background: my group consists of my fiance (GM), her brother (half-orc barbarian), her sister (gnome or halfling rogue), myself (human ranger), and my sister (human druid with super stealthy eagle animal companion). I'm pretty new to Pathfinder (only been playing about half a year off and on), and it's my sister's first time playing, but my fiance and her siblings have played with their dad for years. \n\nAll was going well, and I had been developing my Chaotic Neutral ranger a bit. When it came to the part where the characters meet Tsuto and fight him, nobody could get past my sister (the druid) who was fighting him, so the barbarian and the rogue kept going way down the hallway, while I went and sat on some crates to snack on trail rations. Eventually my character hears the druid's eagle screeching down the hall and goes to investigate. He sees that the druid got knocked unconscious and Tsuto escaped. What follows next was a bit of a douche move, but understandable for my CN character: I looted my sister of her gold, freed Ameiko from the adjacent room, and then escorted both the injured to the town's hospital or whatever they have in Sandpoint. Meanwhile, the rogue and the barbarian kept wandering down the hall.\n\nThe druid healed up at the hospital and then we went and joined the others down the hallway. Now, I have to mention that EVERYONE in our group distrusted my character even though their characters only knew that I had taken the druid to the hospital (nobody was around/conscious except for me when the druid's gold disappeared). Anyway, that brings us to the session that we had recently: my best and worst one rolled into one.\n\nWe proceeded to investigate the dungeon we found past the glassworks (not sure what it's called), and the whole time my ranger was tagging along way behind everyone else because any time I would venture close to any of them they'd shoo me away, almost as if I wasn't part of the team anymore. At one point the party split up, the barbarian and the rogue investigating one passage and me and the druid investigating another. We stumbled upon the weird invisible flying sorcerer batlady thing, and everybody ran for it. The druid, barbarian, and rogue went adventuring on the other path while I kept running in circles through the halls firing shots with my longbow behind me, occasionally hitting the invisible lady for extremely minor damage. I accidentally went down a dead end back into its lair, at which point I realized that I was a dead man because the rest of my party had left me to die against this invisible boss chick. Here's how it went:\n\nMe: I close the door behind me, turn to face the entry for when it opens the door, I pull out my sickle and soak it in drow poison, and resign myself to fight to the death. \n\n&gt;roll percentage to see if I accidentally get drow poison on myself\n&gt;i dont\n\nGM: ok she opens the door. You get an attack of opportunity.\n\n&gt; natural 20\n\nMe: cheering irl\n\n&gt;threat for crit\n\n&gt;roll 19 \n\n(I knew from shooting it in the hallway that this chick had super high AC, so I was cheering even harder when I rolled this)\n\n&gt; 1d6+3 (x2)\n\n&gt; roll a 5 and a 6, for a total of 17 dmg\n\n(practically jizzing my pants at this point)\n\nGM: the creature lets out a scream and clutches at a giant gash in its side, but it's still up\n\nMe: isn't it unconscious? (drow poison)\n\nGM: its immune to poison\n\nMe: ...\n\nSo that was the attack of opportunity, so then its my turn and I miss it. The barbarian comes lumbering over from wherever it was, tries to steal my epic kill but he misses. My turn again, perception check to find out where this invisible chick is. Found its general area, make the attack roll (18), but have 50% chance of missing, roll 51% so I barely hit it. Do the final 4 damage to bring her down.\n\nBarbarian's turn\n\nBarb: I search her for loot\n\nAt this point I am seething mad. My party distrusted my character through metagaming, left him to die on his own, then I made a legendary move and brought down a FREAKING INVISIBLE CHICK even though she was immune to poison, and now this mother fucker is going to loot her when he did absolutely nothing other than leaving me to die?\n\nMe: I roll stealth to see if Grakkenthokkk (the barb) notices me creep up behind him\n\nBarb's perception doesn't beat my stealth check\n\nMe: I attack him with my drow-soaked sickle (to knock him unconscious so I can take back what I fucking earned), catching him flat-footed\n\nEveryone: wat\n\n|roll 14\n\n[MFW](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/439/825/7f8.gif) his flat-footed AC is 15\n\nBarb: you're dead\n\n|rolls attack/dmg, kills me with 1 hit...like not unconscious, straight-up dead.\n\nSo there you have it!\n\nBest session: because I had the most epic gaming moment I've had so far in the several months I've been playing...\n\nWorst session: party hated my character, left me to die, then I did all the work and got killed when I tried to stand up for myself.\n\nWhat I've learned:\nthe definition of roleplaying changes depending on the group. Also not to make dick moves (even if my CN character would make them) in this group even if none of their characters would have known about it.\n\n",
