Weird how that happens!\n\nDoes anyone else have a default or reoccurring dream setting?",

My friend, Sarah, was murdered.\n\nI remember the day like it was yesterday. I was sitting in class, waiting for the bell to ring. Suddenly, there was an announcement over the intercom. The principal's voice was shaky as she said that Sarah had been found dead in her apartment. I felt like the ground had been ripped out from under me. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThe days that followed were a blur. We all tried to make sense of what had happened, but there was no answer. The police were investigating, but they didn't have any leads. I felt so lost and confused. How could someone do this to Sarah? She was one of the kindest and most gentle people I had ever known.\n\nAs time passed, the truth slowly came out. It turned out that Sarah had been dating a guy who had a history of violence. He had become jealous and angry when he thought she was seeing someone else, and he had killed her in a fit of rage.\n\nKnowing the truth didn't make it any easier. I still think about Sarah all the time. I wonder what she would be doing now if she were still alive. I wonder if she would have fulfilled her dreams. I wonder if she would have married and had kids. I wonder if she would still be one of my closest friends.\n\nBut all those questions will remain unanswered. Sarah was taken from us too soon, and there is nothing we can do to bring her back. All we can do is remember her and cherish the memories we have of her. Rest in peace, Sarah. You will always be missed.",

        "text": "I've been reflecting on a lot of life things lately, as you do as you grow older, and one of my biggest regrets is not really being true to who I am. I was a very insecure kid growing up, so I developed the bad habit of people pleasing and manipulation (i.e. being fake and wearing a lot of masks) in an attempt to appeal to the people around me so that I could garner the validation of others to make myself feel like I'm worth something. This lead to me being the loud, energetic class clown; to always compliment people without ever throwing in any fair criticisms; and never voicing my own dislikes for how people behave around me and treat me, among many others.\n\nAll of this and more prevented me from discovering myself as an adolescent (who I am, what I want for myself, being confident in the choices I make for myself, etc.), so now I'm just some man-child who doesn't even know how to think for himself. But I want all of that to change, so I've decided to at least start somewhere to enact the change I feel I need and take baby steps forward from there, starting by accepting the fact that I've always been a person who prefers to be quiet and quiet environments. I've always hated being the loud, energetic, positive one in the group. It's very tiring, and it's exhausting to have people constantly look to you to brighten the mood, but being that positive guy meant that people had some level of emotional reliance on me. I've already started to see people feeling disappointed or bitter now that I'm not catering to that side of their wants, and it honestly hurts.\n\nPerhaps I'm exaggerating here, but I feel like I was nothing more than a tool to make these people happy, even if it was at the expense of my own happiness, and now that I'm prioritizing my own happiness and comfort, I can already see some people straying away from me, and for some of those who are still around, I can see them changing their tone and body language with me. The friend group who I used to play games, watch movies, and eat at restaurants with don't even invite me anymore. They text each other privately amongst each other now (I found out because two friends in the group who are kind enough to still accept me told me) to invite each other to get-togethers. Other friends have confronted me, saying things like, \"Hey, why are you so quiet all of a sudden? It's kinda throwing me off.\" or \"Was your voice always this quiet?\".\n\nI'm shocked at how differently people see me just for not putting on the clown mask and now I'm afraid of the things that'll happen when I stop complimenting them all the time, stop lending them money when they ask for it, stop being the shoulder they can lean on when I'm having problems myself, etc. (is the last one selfish?). I'm at a loss. I go to sleep at night these days, imagining so many eyes staring at me - the eyes that used to belong to friends now judging me as some sort of strange anomaly.",

Their only interests are *devices* \n\nI, as a father try to be as productive and encouraging as possible, but I do feel im losing against *technology* and i feel like it's making my kids become a lazy version of themselves.

Im bringing my first child into this world and I plan to go to cosmetology school while also still doing hair on the side to fund my tuition. I am nervous. I tell myself that whatever I pursue will become my new normal so I’ll find a way to make it work. Im just overwhelmed with the thought of thinking I’m biting off more than I can chew. My plan is to go to school in the fall my baby will be around 6 months old and that’ll give me some time to save as much as possible as well. My fiancé plans to work morning shifts that way I can pursue night classes and he can watch baby while I’m in class. I do hair from home right now so I’m able to keep most of my earnings, I’m a legal braider but I want to expand my craft. I’m just so nervous because I can’t seem to find anyone who is doing what I’m doing and can just tell me “hey, you’ll make it through calm down”a part of me is mad at myself for not finding my niche sooner. I genuinely like doing hair, makeup and really all things beauty down to even making clothing. However due to my upbringing (poor) I never had much time to afford or focus on these interest. I feel behind, I feel overwhelmed, I feel like I’m taking on a heavy responsibility. I’m scared to fail… any words of advice, encouragement or similar stories would help so much right now. Reddit has been my save haven to battle my anxiety.",

        "author": "BattleStag17",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1126yke/i_spent_way_too_long_writing_down_my_thoughts_of/",
        "text": "So, overly long thoughts on Velma season 1 from someone with a deep childhood love for Scooby but isn't a racist nitwit. I'll keep any spoilers after the break, but overall:\n\nI wanted to love Velma, and by the end of the season I very nearly liked it. There were some good ideas and I actually laughed a few times, but overall it was too negative and the improvements came too late. When you choose to start in the sewer, even after you climb out you're still going to smell so why start there?\n\nWhat I liked: The setup of being how The Gang came to be is actually a solid idea, even if the main good boy isn't present (yet), and \"Daria in the Scream franchise with a focus on character growth\" is a great elevator pitch. I liked the overall ideas behind each character's core concept and family makeup changes -- yes, even the racial changes. And the art and animation are wonderful, A+ on just about everything visual.\n\nWhat I didn't like: Hoo boy, the execution of just nearly all the writing did not land, at all. The overall mood of the show is just so negative that it sucks nearly all the enjoyment out and I found myself not actually cheering for anyone because everyone straight up sucks. The character growth was great, but every character started so low that by the end of the season everyone was still below baseline decent human standards. Plenty of examples, all of which have spoilers\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe setting: Velma is a show that tries to both have a realistic and permanent world with goofy cartoon action, both of which are at odds with each other. When the wall is torn off someone's house in SpongeBob, it's funny because the wall is repaired as soon as the camera looks away. When the wall is torn off someone's house in Velma, it stays that way and the characters have to just move on like it's no big deal instead of the financial ruin it would actually mean. There's an early scene where a student's leg is sliced off and he shows that injury for the rest of the season, but he cares more about the ongoing popularity contest because the gag is over and the writing is not allowed to linger on a gag.\n\nThe humor: Yikes, the humor did not work. Daria + Scream is a good idea that took both concepts way too far, since most of the humor comes from either pointing out how bad a character is or how much meta movie genre knowledge they have. A character saying something bad and then being shown why they are wrong can make for great humor, but it doesn't work if why they are wrong is because everyone is equally bad. The infamous example of Velma making a MeToo joke is supposed to be a setup to show how she does not, in fact, spit truth, but the disgusted reactions she gets does not work as a punchline because that's how everyone acts regardless of what she does... plus you can have the same setup without insulting SA survivors, like why would you do that.\n\nFor the Scream comparison, there are only so many times before a character can say their situation is just like a horror or romance movie cliché and then do it anyway before it stops being a joke, and that limit was reached by the second episode. Heck, the very first thing we see is a monologue about teens being oversexualized while teens are having a \"sexy\" shower fight, just several minutes of them explaining the joke to you. There are not enough lampshades to hang!\n\nThe characters: Gods, everyone just sucks so, so much. Every single teenager is a vapid twit, every adult is maliciously incompetent, and everyone is bigoted. It works in Family Guy because all sins are forgotten by the end of the episode, but again when everything is permanent you're just left wondering how any of these people manage to exist without being consumed by their own hatred. Especially the main cast!\n\nFred: A rich white boy with rich white boy problems, Fred is actually the least offensive because his character makes a little bit of sense. He's desperate for his dad's approval but too coddled to do anything on his own, so he's a pretentious jerk. It works, more or less. And he has the most character growth, even if he just goes from objectifying women for their bodies to objectifying women for their brains because he read a single book on feminism, but hey. Bar is not high here.\n\nDaphne: Went from Velma's best friend to exceedingly vindictive bully for... reasons. I think because she was jealous of Velma's trauma? It doesn't make sense and their relationship swung from good to bad so often and so quickly that it gave me whiplash.\n\nNorville: The only two genuinely good and caring people in this entire show are Norville and his father, but this is a BAD quality. They are weak, spineless men that roll over for everyone, Norville is desperately in love with Velma for whatever ungodly reason and it results in her taking advantage of him in every single scene he's in. The joke here is that he's a beta soyboy loser, you see. Even when objectively better women are throwing themselves at him, Norville will always come back to Velma's abuse and it's more sad than funny.\n\nVelma: The protagonist holds herself as above all the petty teenage squabbles and incompetent adults, but she's the biggest bully of them all. Every word she speaks is dripping with sarcasm, she constantly berates everyone for having problems that aren't about her missing mom, and for someone supposedly tuned in to problems with white privilege and the patriarchy she sure does spend a lot of time making fun of non-white races and women as well. I don't know if they were trying to go for an angle of making fun of everyone a la South Park or what, but those jokes usually at least point out the better option as part of the punchline. Not Velma, conservatives and the woke suck equally to her.\n\nThe last episodes: Much of the growth comes all at once at the end, meaning everything feels too late and too rushed at the same time. There's a big reveal that Velma was hypnotized as a child to be extra traumatized and off-putting, which would actually be a great moment for character growth as she overcomes the hypnosis if it happened in the middle of the season! But it doesn't, and instead Velma's \"big character growth\" was sitting down and listening to all the voicemails that Norville had been leaving her. Hundreds of voicemails over two years that she had been utterly ignoring because Velma couldn't be arsed to care about her most loyal friend unless she was calling on him for favors. It takes effort to neglect someone to that extent, and we're supposed to cheer that she did the absolute bare minimum?\n\nThen there's the final reveal that the killer is Fred's mom, who is looking to swap his brain with a girl's because girls know how to work hard and it'll make him a better heir to the family empire or something. Norville accidentally impales her in an act of self-defense, and Norville's therapist father blithely suggests that he starts smoking weed to deal with the PTSD that anyone would get from manslaughter. Cool. And Fred and Norville are supposed to be best friends after this?\n\nIt sucks because there is the foundation of a great show here, but every facet is just so negative when it doesn't need to be. People need redeeming qualities, there needs to be small wins, friends need to support each other, or it just becomes a wankfest of nihilism without any self-awareness and that's what we got. Even if this upward trend continues for several seasons, it'll always taste a tad bitter because the start was so gross.\n\nWhat I would do to change the show: First, the obvious of not have every character be a caricature of selfishness and give everyone some kind of redeeming quality. Just make everyone 10% better people across the board.\n\nSecond, the hypnosis reveal happens in the middle of the season and Velma goes on an actual apology tour as she comes to terms with her actions. Show her actually be humbled and struggle with the negative attitude that was imposed on her, and while everything isn't resolved at the end we can actually believe that the others would want to be around her. In fact, the hypnosis now becomes a major plot point to explain everyone else's attitudes as well. Turns out the cops are incompetent because the villain keeps hypnotizing them to get away with crimes, what a concept!\n\nFinally, the villain becomes a partner of Fred's parents, so that the overall story doesn't change but it still doesn't end with Norville freaking bisecting Fred's mom. I honestly believe those few changes would've made a world of difference without changing it to something else entirely.\n\nAnd the Scoob! sequel got cancelled instead of this, just a damn shame.",

        "text": "These lava themed nightmares have been ongoing a once or twice a week for two or three months now:\n\nI remember one last week where I was in a corporate building, and then someone announced over the intercom that there was lava headed for us. This caused a lot of confusion and panic; we had to escape on planes parked outside, but the planes were all far away at the time. Lava entered the building as everyone was scrambling around. A recurring theme in these dreams is that my legs barely work at all, and I have to ask someone else to boost me up and lend me an arm so I can escape with everyone else. My legs feel like lead, and it's honestly terrifying. I feel so helpless and the kindness of others is the only way I \"survive\" these dreams. In this one, I believe they found a wheelchair for me at a certain point.\n\nI am an able-bodied 27yo who has never had to ride in a wheelchair except for legal reasons when leaving the psych ward under certain conditions. (I have bipolar disorder type 1 with psychotic features and take medication for it).\n\nI never seem to outright die during these dreams -- I just get very close, then escape to relative safety. It almost feels like there's an off-switch in my brain for whenever things get too bizarre, and then I turn off the sleep and shake myself awake for a moment.\n\nHere is one from last night:\n\nThe lava pours into this concrete room from ornately tiled rectangular drains near the ceiling. The room begins to fill. I startle myself awake to realize I'm safe in bed. I roll over a few times, taking several minutes to go back to sleep. I never see how I escape the room, but there's the lava again, except this time we're in a jeep-like vehicle trying to outmaneuver it. Someone else is driving, and I am in the back seat. After turning first this way, then up the other mountain for a little while, another closer volcano explodes, and we find every exit is blocked by more lava. I look across the cityscape to see the old volcano against the darkened sky in the distance, still smoking but done for now. We travel back down the mountain into the city, narrowly avoiding the river behind us until the red liquid rock begins to slow down and cool to black. Once the lava is cool enough to walk on but still warm to the touch, I am sent on a side mission to find someone important, and I am walking around over the freshly-made stone through the streets, wondering why such a large city was built under these volcanoes, thinking that the eruptions must have been sudden . . . Just then, the volcano erupts again, and I am running out of time to catch the bus, assuming the buses are still running . . . No, that doesn't make any sense. I wake up again. Fall back asleep. I'm on the bus, and the driver is going a good job avoiding the lava, which flows around us in thick rivers.\n\nThat's the last I remember. This is terrifying me, everyone.",

It's like a repetitive cycle I'm cycling to make a word called \"career\", aren't careers post WW2 inventions anyway? \n\nI just feel so good at times and also terribly lonely, often I go to a nearby park and see people having fun. I just at this point, don't know perhaps, given up but also I feel it'll get better by time, this might be the hope that keeps on going. Hope is both good and bad thing according to me, it keeps you going also it breaks your heart with expectations.",

Current estimates say that HST currently has enough speed and altitude to stay in orbit for another 10 years plus or minus 2 years. I recently saw it depends a lot on how active the sun is and how many solar particles are thrown HST's way. \n\nBut the longevity of this space craft, and the demand from scientists using it is so great still that NASA is highly compelled to keep HST running longer. There are currently no immediate replacements for the Hubble Space Telescope. The replacement in development is likely not going to be ready until the late 2030s and an even more ambitious design is probably not going to be ready until the late 2040s. Basically HST is still needed to fill that niche in the light spectrum of observation of visible light. \n\nThis chance to save Hubble to continue doing science for another decade or more safely just fills me with joy. The little kid inside of me that saw all the pictures that Hubble was responsible for in Nat Geo and astronomy books just squees!!\n\nI still think NASA should preserve HST as a museum one day, but this is a far more attainable goal.",

The only reason I want to go to college is to satisfy my parents but I have no real goals or ambitions of my own. Why even bother? In all honesty the only reason I’m even looking forward to college is meeting new people and getting drunk, but even that might be a challenge since I don’t even have a sense of self. I don’t know who I am. I feel like I’ve lived my whole life trying to please other people that I don’t know what my passions or interests are. I don’t have many friends either, only a couple I’ve had since middle school. I also have a girlfriend who is currently in college but I feel like that is about to fall apart at any second as well.

        "text": "(I am not a physicist or cosmologist. The following rant may not be entirely correct, and may even be entirely incorrect, but it's based on my understanding of standard model physics/cosmology and I need to write it down because I can't stop thinking about it. PLEASE correct me if you know I'm wrong.)\n\nSpace and time are more or less the same thing. They are fundamentally bound together. (Up+Down), (Left+Right) and (Forward+Back), aka the x, y, and z axes, are the 3 spatial dimensions while (Forward in time+Back in time) is the temporal dimension, t. Don’t let that semantic distinction fool you though. They’re all dimensions in essentially the same way. The only reason we separate them like that is because our conscious mind interprets and experiences them very differently.\n\nYour body and mind exist in time the same way they exist in space; as objects with substance. As space expands the parts of space that already exist and that which they contain don't just go away. We of course wouldn’t be here were that the case. Space just keeps growing larger and all of the objects that already exist continue to exist regardless of this expansion. Time, as a dimension, expands just as space does and the older parts of time, along with all of the objects that already exist therein, also still exist just like those in space. In fact it's entirely possible that the whole future \"already\" exists too. We just aren't capable of looking over there. (The words \"over there\" apply in exactly the same way as pointing to an object and saying it's over there. The past is just *over there* while the future is in the opposite direction.)\n\nWe are only able to experience the fourth dimension in one direction because that's just how our consciousness manifests and imparts a sensible order on things. Time doesn’t move. Our consciousness \"moves\" through time just as our bodies move through space, only it's restricted to one direction. This makes it seem like we are always racing toward a permanent end but that's not quite how it works. Each moment of our lives is simply a piece of an object that will exist suspended in time after our deaths unless, somehow, the fabric of the universe and spacetime itself is destroyed. Your birth and your death are simply your boundaries in time in the same way that the top of you head and the tip of your toes are your boundaries on the z axis. Just because you don't extend any taller doesn't mean you're \"dead\" above your head or below your feet. Your body just doesn't extend to that particular location.\n\nI find it helps to understand this idea if you think of memory as a sensory experience akin to sight. Your eyes allow you to sense objects in the spatial dimensions. The closer you are to the object the easier it is to see. As the object gets further away it becomes harder to recognize and can become distorted in various ways. Sight is imperfect. You're only able to focus in detail on one small point at any given moment and your brain fills in the rest to form a complete, if imperfect, picture. Sometimes we see things that aren't really there but could swear are real. Memory is *exactly like this* except it's used to sense the temporal dimension and only in one direction: back. The things you see in your memories are literal, physical objects that exist *over there*. We can't see the future in the same way that we can't see what's behind us. We can only look forward in space and we can only look backwards in time. That's just the nature of our consciousness. (This is an imperfect analogy since you can turn your head to see what's back there. We can't turn our memory in another direction like we can with our sight, but you get the idea)\n\nThis logic makes me much more comfortable with the idea of death. You don't stop existing when you die any more than you stop existing when you stop growing taller. The totality of every moment of your life from birth to death is a single 4 dimensional object that theoretically, if viewed from a 5th dimensional perspective, would appear as solid and substantial as a cake sitting on a table in front of you appears in 3 dimensions. Think of each moment of your life as a little slice of that cake because that’s more or less what it is. Our consciousness lives within the boundaries of the cake. It's hard to tell that it's a whole cake when you can only taste one slice at a time in a very specific sequence but the whole thing would clearly exist all at once if only it could be viewed from the outside. The \"when\" of our existence in time is akin to the \"where\" of the location of the cake.\n\nI suspect that all things seem to move at the same speed and in the same direction through time because there is some kind of temporal inertia that was imparted equally upon everything when the big bang happened. If this were the case and nothing exists in the temporal dimension that could slow or stop this inertia they would just keep going at the same speed like objects with inertia in space. Just a thought.\n\nIf you want to know more about this line of thought, look up the “Block Universe” theory. It essentially states that everything that is, was, or ever will be already exists. It's not necessarily a widely accepted or definitively confirmed theory but it is taken seriously as a possibility by some very smart people.\n\nI’ll admit that I’m not a scientist or anything, I just like learning about theoretical physics and cosmology. Frankly, my interpretation might be dead wrong and I accept that. This rant just represents the culmination of a casual fascination and a penchant for writing way too much.",

        "text": "The festival is Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) and it takes place in Las Vegas in May. It's one of the largest electronic music festivals in the world. I've always been into electronic music and concerts and going to this festival has been on my bucket list since 2015. Unlike most other festivals, this is an \"all-night\" festivals taking place from dusk to dawn. I didn't get to go until las year because I didn't have a nice job until 2019 and then the pandemic hit. After saving up some money, I was finally able to go to the festival and it was awesome. I bought tickets back in 2020 but the 2021 festival got called off because of the pandemic that was still happening. Last year, my wish finally came true.\n\nI flew into Las Vegas, got a rental car and checked into my hotel. Shuttles were sold out so I had to spend extra on a rental car. However I needed some method to get from the Las Vegas city center to the Motor Speedway where EDC takes place. On the first day, I leave early to beat the traffic and reach the Motor Speedway. The venue was massive and filled with artsy installations and massive stages. An hour later and the sky was getting dark and the crowds already started packing the place. I spend the first night exploring the venue and enjoying the rides. On the second night, I stay almost the entire night enjoying the artists this time. Same on the third and last night to I could watch the closing ceremony. After the festival, I flew back to my home city and I was exhausted! I'm glad I took an extra day of work off.\n\nI have Autism and I'm neurodivergent. I'm very high functioning and I can do regular things like any neurotypical person. However there's always something off about my social and communication skills that can make me stand out in an negative way. I don't ever see myself as superior to lower functioning or less privileged Autistic people, but I'm thankful I can safely live and travel by myself. Autistic and neurodivergent people are generalized for being very introverted. Hance being very introverted and hating crowds and \"nice\" weather. It's a stereotype that Autistic people like to stay indoors and are anti-social. I'm an exception and I enjoy the sheer positive energy at these festivals. I cannot be the only one. I enjoy festivals because of the massive, sheer amounts of positive energy in them.\n\nI really wished I could go to EDC again this year, but I was unfortunately laid off from my last job and I'm currently looking for another job. If I don't have a job, I don't have an income. If I don't have an income, then I can't enjoy going to these festivals and having a wonderful time. I don't really want to go again because it's VERY expensive if you're going alone. I spend around $2,000 and that was mostly on transportation and hotels. Also safety can be a major issue since you're doing A LOT of night walking.",
