It seems like redditors have an almost universal penchant for conspiratorial type tone or conjecture, such as George Carlin.

A long comment is worth more than a factual one, and a video for laypeople that is incorrect or dramatically misrepresents issues is taken more seriously than one that matches the real world.\n\nThese two patterns of bias really seem to be some of the most influential parts of the reddit experience.  People attribute all sorts of things in the world to psychological/sociological/economical concepts, even if it is inaccuate.  For example, redditors link and talk about regulatory capture, Dunning Kruger, and the rest, even if it isn't accurate or is flat out wrong in the context.\n\nIn closing, it seems like reddit is really warped by these things.  These are just my personal observations.  What is your opinion?  \n\nThis isn't the most eloquent thing, but I just though I would try and put them all together here, since I've seen these two things discussed in passing on this sub.",

This confused me, as reddit supposedly has a very slim or nonexistent profit margin, and the image previews are hosted by reddit itself through a website called \"imgix.com\" (which reddit presumably pays for hosting). Why would they voluntarily incur more expenses? \n\nOne thing I notice is that the previews are only for direct links, which give imgur no ad revenue (as opposed to gallery images, which do give ad revenue). This is in tandem with imgur adding ads to direct links for mobile viewers. It could be an agreement between imgur and reddit to reduce  bandwith on imgur that does not provide ad revenue. \n\nDo they think the anticipated rise in user satisfaction will lead to more pageviews and more revenue? Or is reddit trying to distance itself from imgur by sending less traffic their way? I would be interested to hear your thoughts. ",

The US parties' presidential nominations are a great example [graph](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=trump.bernie&amp;start=20141105&amp;end=20150831&amp;smoothing=13). [imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/ji2Ga65.png). \n\n\nAs we can see, last spring, Bernie jumped out the gate on reddit, with /r/Sandersforpresident posts regularly reaching the front page and politics swamped by pro-Bernie (and anti-Hillary) content. \n\n\nHowever, by the summer, an altogether new phenomenon began to appear: that of Donald Trump's popularity. From almost nowhere (compared to Bernie) in June, by August, Trump had emerged as reddit's favourite candidate in terms of mentions, a position he has held ever since. That summer we saw the creation of the lively subreddit /r/The_Donald. Since, Trump's lead has, in fact, increased. \n\n\nHow to explain this? Is it because of brigading/infiltration from 4chan's notorious /pol/ board, as some have alleged? Impossible to say. Of course, there is never simply one hivemind on a website with millions of users from around the world, there are always strong crosscurrents intersecting. However, a great number of redditors appear to feel the political system is broken and an \"outsider\" needs to be elected to the Presidency to shake it up, otherwise, the country is doomed. Reddit has decided that Sanders and Trump are two outsiders who can do just this. Hence the easy jumping ship between Bernie and Trump and the sentiment \"if not Bernie, Donald.\" Hillary and the other Republican nominees are seen as insiders, tainted by Washington and corporate money. This view is ironic, as both Sanders and Trump are both themselves part of the establishment. Sanders joined the democratic party last year and supported foreign wars. He also said he would campaign for Hillary if she wins the nomination. Trump is a multibillionare businessman who inherited his wealth and has close links to Wall Street and the Clintons. He is virtually the face of neoliberalism. Yet many of [his supporters believe he will immediately \"clean up\" Wall Street.](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4eyc5j/rshitredditsays_is_putting_up_direct_links_to_our/d24pfl8)\n\n\nOutside of the reddit world, [real world bookmakers believe Hillary is a virtual shoo-in](http://i.imgur.com/Ik9iWRs.png) to be the next president, meaning both sides of reddit will be disillusioned and angry. Reddit will have to deal with a winter of discontent.\n",

        "text": "At least in terms of popular ones that most people have heard of. \n\nI'd say one of the best is /r/AskHistorians. People complain about comment graveyards, but it's very rare to find a subreddit more focused on, and successfully dedicated to, delivering reliable and informative answers and discussion about a given subject. The moderators are not afraid to delete low-quality comments, and the quality of the subreddit is higher because of it. Obviously not every subreddit benefits from this heavy-handed approach, but in the case of history it's good to have high and uncompromising standards for submissions and comments.\n\nThe worst, I think, is /r/politics. I would use this subreddit as a lesson in learning to take criticism and not being afraid to enforce your own rules as a moderator. The subreddit's stated purpose (\"Currently and Explicitly Political U.S. News\") is wildly out of step with its actual content (24/7 Sanders rally) because the moderators A. Refuse to remove repetitive and biased content (To the point where [the filter](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4aez6q/hard_ignore_makes_rpolitics_readable/) I made for the subreddit filters out **21 posts** from the front page) and B. Refuse to acknowledge when they're doing a bad job and [instead blame it on their subscribers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4dwhub/april_meta_discussion_bias_behavior_and_anything/) ",

I run the subreddit /r/SubsToRequest ~~and a very-lightly-edited version of that screenshot'ed write-up is [here in the sub's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubsToRequest/wiki/index#wiki_why_should_you_request_subreddits.3F).~~ edit: I've taken it down; I'm going to post it as a discussion topic at some point inside the sub.\n\nI'm slowly changing my mind... as I've seen a few instances of users requesting subs for (what I perceive to be) shitty reasons. I'm thinking about deleting my write-up in favor of writing something else: a Sub Requester's Etiquette that's \"officially\" condoned by /r/SubsToRequest: Do's and Don't's about what motivations are decent when you're requesting a sub and what motivations are less than savory.\n\nI'd love to have a discussion here about what concrete things you think are acceptable or unacceptable to do when it comes to requesting and becoming the mod of an abandoned or banned subreddit. \n\nThanks in advance for any/all feedback! I'm really looking forward to super interesting civil comments and discussion about this to help me and all other future sub requesters get an idea for what qualifies as decent and indecent behavior when it comes to requesting (&amp; becoming the new mod of) a subreddit.\n\nPS - yes, this is an alt - I'm /u/stophauntingme.  Anything/everything regarding /r/SubsToRequest and Meta things on Reddit I've relegated to this username. It's not a secret: my first post under this username confirms who I am :)\n\nEdit: I've expanded /r/SubsToRequest's purpose as being a super friendly &amp; welcoming environment to talk about anything/everything regarding reddit request. As such, submissions are now totally open to the public :)",

Aside from occasional blips like the Ron Paul mania from four years ago, and the half-serious, half-ironic Trump supporters that pop up here and there to piss people off, most of Reddit users have rallied behind the Democratic candidate in the presidential election.\n\nBut for the past six months at least, it seems that at least 90% of the posts in /r/politics have been either positive posts about Bernie Sanders, or negative posts about Hillary Clinton. While the Democratic primaries are far from over, the chances are high that Hillary will be given the nomination. How will militantly anti-Hillary, pro-Bernie subs respond to that situation? Will they backpedal and act like they always supported Hillary? Will they respond with cynicism and hopeless hand-wringing? Or will there be a 'silent majority' of Clinton supporters that will rise from the woodwork and downvote any anti-Hillary posts?\n\nThe political discourse on Reddit can seem like a circlejerk if you only look at the titles of posts on /r/politics and such, but if you look at the comments on most subreddits, it's clear that a large number of users are irritated with the Bernie Sanders circlejerk. These people who comment on posts seem to be different from the people who upvote on posts. Basically, what I'm wondering about is...if Hillary were to win the Democratic nomination, how would the front page of /r/politics change, if at all?",

        "text": "I feel as though hateful sentiments have grown very, very quickly on reddit over the past year or so. Obviously there have always been small subreddits filled with derogatory, hateful content. But those types of subreddits hitting the front page was pretty much unheard of. These days it's not only unrare that these types of subreddits make it to the front page, they occasionally manage to dominate it.\n\nIn my memory, it started with /r/fatpeoplehate. I'm not sure what triggered it, but suddenly, I started seeing several posts on /r/all from the subreddit. At first it seemed to be somewhat reasonable: backlash against the people who preach \"healthy at all sizes\" and take body acceptance to an extreme. Fair enough, I think. But it didn't take long for it turn into blatantly hateful, uncalled for attacks against *anyone* who was overweight. Simple pictures of fat people doing nothing besides being fat would be upvoted and laughed at. Anyone who tried to tell /r/fatpeoplehate that they were taking it way overboard would be called fat themselves. For me, hatred for the sake of hatred on the front page of reddit.com was entirely new and surprising. Then Ellen Pao happened. Throughout all of this, it seemed as though racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamaphobic, anti-police, anti-social justice, etc. undertones were forming. Hateful sentiments were no longer just appearing in certain subreddits. They could be in the comments of any post on any topic. Sometimes they were subtle, sometimes they only had 20-30 upvotes, and sometimes they'd be blatant with thousands of upvotes and gold. Looking back now, I think the development of these undertones was the beginning of a backlash against too much political correctness, but that's just a theory. Today we have /r/The_Donald. It's... well, you've seen the front page. I'm a cuck, you're a cuck, everyone's a cuckcuck. The posts are downright mean. Everyone who posts there can be described as nothing more than an asshole. And it's all validated by a *very successful United States presidential candidate*. That's a whole lotta validation.\n\nWhy? Why is this happening, and why is it happening so quickly? There is just so much acceptance and encouragement for being an hateful dick towards others, often for no reason at all (or with reactionary, emotionally charged reasoning). There is very clearly backlash against this hatefulness. Go mention /r/fatpeoplehate or /r/The_Donald in a random thread and you'll get several people responding about how shitty those subreddits are. But the fact that posts from such subreddits can garner more than enough upvotes to regularly hit the front page, they're clearly not that much of a minority, right? \n\nIt's hard for me accept this rapid change as a natural progression simply because of how rapid it has been. It's hard for me to accept that this exact point in history is unique and breeds more inflammatory responses than in the past. Perhaps it's a combination of the two?\n\nBut one theory I have is related to 4chan. For the longest time, 4chan (particularly /b/) was seen as the hub of hateful and undesirable behavior on the Internet. There were no rules. Anything and everything was posted. There were actual radical racists, actual radical sexists, actual pedophiles, actual murderers, actual rapists... and plenty more people who would pretend to be all of those things to be funny and get a rise out of others. All that pretending inevitably attracted (and perhaps bred) more people who weren't pretending, and lines between trolling and not became blurred. Throughout the years, 4chan has had a multitude of \"wars\" and \"splits\" for various reasons. In late 2014, 4chan \"split\" as a result of some GamerGate drama. Some \"censorship\" happened and \"rules\" were put in place on 4chan, causing many users to look for a new home to freely express their hatred (specifically, at the time, for SJWs). In Jan 2015, moot (the owner of 4chan) retired, and in September sold 4chan to the owner of 2chan. This new owner was accused of previously selling user data, causing many users to again, flee from 4chan. Disclaimer: I have spent maybe a total of three hours on 4chan over the course of 12+ years. I have been aware of its existence and the type of community (specifically /b/ and /r9k/) it has through occasional visits, screenshots of posts, and friends who frequented the site. Therefore, my understanding of the 4chan community as a whole is limited.\n\nSo I wonder if, perhaps, some of these 4chan \"splits\" caused some of its users to move to reddit. Further, I wonder if 4chan moving from the \"say whatever the fuck you want, especially if it's hateful\" attitude left those who wanted that type of community without a true home. In other words, maybe the specific users of 4chan did not migrate to reddit, but the part of the attitude of 4chan did.\n\nTL;DR: There are always going to be hateful people who jump to conclusions and make harsh judgements about people different form them. Why is that type of attitude so much more prominent on reddit now than it was in previous years, though? Do you guys think this is just the result of the natural progression of an Internet community (i.e. the bigger an Internet community becomes, the more undesirable people it attracts), a massive community's reaction to unique current events (e.g. rising obesity, frequent terrorist attacks, radical feminism, backlash against political correctness, etc.), or has reddit absorbed some of the 4chanesque Internet community? \n\nEDIT: Fixed a few typos.",

        "text": "Like the title says, I wrote a history for the Reddit Clans of the mobile game Clash of Clans and the subreddit /r/ClashOfClans that I thought there might be a small chance someone here might enjoy. \n\nTo give a brief summary:\n\n\nThe game \"Clash of Clans\" is a mobile game in which players build bases, raid other players for resources, and form clans of up to 50 people to socialize and mutually benefit each other in the game. \n\n/r/ClashOfClans was created over 3 years ago by a redditor when the game was new. There was an interest in clans for redditors so he created a series of clans that became a group called the Reddit Clan System (RCS) which had more organization and enforced a quality that made these clans superior to most in the game.   \n\nThe RCS took in those from the sub wanting to join the Reddit Clans until there were 100 official clans ~5,000 people.) This was one of the largest if not the largest clan systems in the game and the clans found ways to cooperatively enjoy the game. Because of this origin, the moderaters of this sub also had the position of leadership and decision making authority over the RCS clans.\n\nOver time, the game changed, particularly with the addition of a new element called Clan Wars that made individual players performance more strongly impact the rest of the clan. \n\nIssues arose when the moderators of the sub were split between their subreddit duties and managing the clans in a game they no longer had as much time to play at the new level of competition that was becoming popular. There was also a conflict of interest perceived by many subreddit users in that, as time went by, there were over 80,000 subscribers to the subreddit and a majority of them were not members of official \"Reddit Clans\" even though RCS clans were still seen as being given privilege on the sub. \n\nIn this environment,  the RCS had several internal issues that spilled dramatically onto the subreddit as moderators reacted against other moderators and caused factions of the RCS to split off.\n\nUltimately both the RCS and the subreddit were reorganized with the clans being more self-led and the subreddit taking on moderators who represented the larger community and were less tied to the RCS.\n\nThis history is a detailed study of how a subreddit was  used to provide a good deal of structure to an outside system (clans in Clash of Clans) which was mutually beneficial when both were growing, but the problems that occurred when they stayed tightly linked as both grew large and their interests diverged.\n\nThe history was performed using artifacts and posts from Reddit and interviews with the people involved on all sides of the conflicts.\n\nI thought /r/TheoryofReddit might enjoy. \n\nHere it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditClansHistory/wiki/the_history_of_the_reddit_clans\n\nTl;dr: a lot happened in 3+ years with a large group of humans playing a mobile game and connecting through reddit.",

        "text": "EDIT: wrote on my phone. Sorry for typos\n\nI think age change is a primary, but not the only, factor. I remember what it was like as a child on the internet. We didnt really empathize well because we didnt have the experience to. This isnt a criticism though, and perhaps childhood innocence does empathize more than ruthless ambitious adults. But on average, I dont think this is so. This is why many middle schoolers seem to value capital punishment or say \"evolution\" when there is a video of someone getting hurt. They dont understand big mistakes yet. \n\nSo on the internet, it manifests as trolls who think \"its just a joke, if you are offended, then you are weak. If you get hurt from the internet then its your fault.\" Children are somewhat more resilient to insults since its common in their schools (not that they are impervious). Also, remembering from when I was a kid, many middle schoolers bragged when they shoplifted or hacked someone online or scammed something. They didnt care about the lives.\n\nI'm not sure how to address this, but I think having people put their age would be good. However, maybe people will lie (like I did as a child). Thoughts?\n\nI assume I will get downvoted since Reddit is mainly kids now. Kids have this idea that \"only ideas matter. My age is irrelevant. Only judge me by my ideas.\" But thats naive. First, many things in life cannot be settled by reason or evidence. There are **incommunicable truths.** Things you believe simply because you experienced them. This goes both ways, including truths kids know but adults have long forgotten. But ime, adults are more likely to believe incommunicable truths exist. Second, experience is a credibility. Its like needing a medical degree. Sure, it is possible for someone to be smarter than a doctor without going to med school, and kids who are insightful without experience. But I will still only go to a trained doctor. But every kid thinks they are a genius.\n\nOne of the reasons I think this is based on subreddit. \"Adult subs\" have nicer people. No one trolls. No one insults you. People are serious. Places like alcohol subs, or cooking, academic niches, etc. then more mainstream subs where kids frequent are shit. Places like politics, atheism, gaming, videoes, etc.\n\nThoughts? Is requiring age a good idea?\nEdit: sorry for title typo",

However if you compare the subscribers numbers of the top 8 subreddits relative to each other, it becomes clear that something unnatural was happening during that time period:\n\n[Subscriber numbers of the top 8 subreddits relative to each other](http://i.imgur.com/6Xnikll.png) (The x axis represents average growth on any given day)\n\nAll of a sudden from Mar 30 2015 onwards /r/announcements attracted way fewer new subscribers than all other big subreddits. The sub's ranking continued to fall until it arrived at #8 position. Shortly after that time - on Jan 30th 2016 - the demise abruptly stopped and the growth trend continued as it used to be before the slide to #8 position.\n\n# The likely cause\n\nNow we do not need to speculate what the cause for this lack of new subscribers was. When reddit introduced geodefaults, /u/ChallengeResponse created [a list of defaults by country](https://np.reddit.com/r/defaults/comments/3hu24f/list_of_default_subreddits_20150821_multiple/). From this list, it's clear that both /r/announcements and /r/blog have been geo-nondefaults in France, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Singapore at least.\n\nSince I am from one of these countries I can confirm that creating a new account now subscribes you to /r/announcements again. I'm almost certain this is the case in all other listed countries as well.\n\n# The possible reason\n\nKnowing the technical cause still doesn't explain what the reason for this move on behalf of the admins was. It could of course be coincidence but it strikes me as odd that the shrinking was stopped shortly after reaching #8 spot. \n\nIf you look at http://redditmetrics.com/top you'll notice that there's 500,000 subscribers between #1 and #8 but another 400,000 between #8 und #9, so at this rate it would have taken almost another year to let /r/announcements sink to #9.\n\nHence my theory: /r/announcements was undefaulted in a couple of countries in order to have only active and user-run subs in any listing of the biggest 7 subreddits. Similar applies to /r/blog that fell out of the top 10 in that timeframe.",

        "text": "If you're not aware, there are several databases out there that have created tags for  a massive amount of users. These tags are assigned according to the most controversial subreddits you visit. Anybody who has RES can copy those databases so they can see the user tags as they browse reddit.\n\nSo for example, when I see a post by Spez, there is a tag next to him telling me that he is a 'gamerghazi' user. Not because he uses that subreddit the most, but because he uses that subreddit the most out of any of the \"controversial\" subreddits he views. \n\nSo, getting on with it, I recently copied over these tags, and it's affected my user experience is both positive and negative ways:\n\nThe positive:\n\n* I get into way less pointless arguments. By looking at the tag, I can tell when somebody has a fundamental disagreement with me that we're not going to get past. \n\n* I tend to minimize more threads that I feel will descend into pointless circlejerking. When you see a lot of people posting who share similar controversial subreddits, it saves a lot of time just ignoring it from the outright.\n\n* Brigading tends to be easier to spot. You can tell when a lot of people from the same subreddit all reply or comment to a post.\n\nThe negative:\n\n* It's easier to outright dismiss people who post in say, coontown, even though they may be contributing the conversation. This is true even if the conversation is completely unrelated to that controversial topic.\n\n* Continuing along with the previous point, I subconsciously tend to downvote certain people more than others, because of their tags.\n\nThe neutral:\n\n* It allows me to interpret the conversation in ways that may make more sense. This is really the crux of it all, and what all the other points were leading up to. When somebody posts something, looking at their tagged subreddit helps me interpret what they are trying to convey. But, this is both good and bad, because I am, in some sense, using external context to assign more meaning than the poster may have meant or wanted to show. I am adding more words than there are.  \n\n\n* Take for example, someone posting a joke about race. It may be funny, and they may have meant no harm. Of course, you're not sure. Some people do actually post jokes about race in order to spread racism, or because they are racist. Although, the vast majority of people tell jokes about race because they think it's funny and just controversial enough; they are not racist.   \nNow, you see that the commenter has 'the_donald' as their tagged subreddit. Well, when I look at that, I can't help but thinking that the commenter is, in fact, racist, and did mean harm by posting the joke. Sure, not everybody on the_donald is racist, but it's hard not making the mental jump when you see the user's tag. Also, it really does help mentally sort out what people are trying to say on the thread.\n\n* As a side note, the inverse is also true, where if I see a user say something slightly off about, say women, then I'm more likely to give them the benefit of the doubt if they are a poster in 'feminism'.\n\nI know that a lot of that was my personal experiences, but I thought they were interesting enough to share. From what I experienced, the mass tagging made my experience of reddit better overall. I know some of you will disagree - I'm interested in hearing what other people who have the mass user tags think about this. \n\nAlso, as something to think about, would reddit be better overall if mass tagging was implemented for everybody? I know people would for sure get in fewer arguments. But the same positives and negatives I said in my post apply, but in a much larger scale.\n\n",

It means, at the least, that a single user was the subject of a classified warrant. \n\nReally, what good is a warrant canary in this regard? \n\nSo I have a followup: If it's *skirting the line* to even have a warrant canary (however legal that might be), as /u/spez has said, then would it be outright illegal to put a canary on literally every user's profile, specific to them, and visible only to the user? Or is the fact that the information is 'public' what allows it to remain legal? If so, why not a public canary on every user? \n\nShit, it doesn't even need to be text. It could be a little doodle of a live bird in a cage or a dead one. You wouldn't need to even explain what that meant explicitly: Just add it. We'd all figure out what that image means within hours, all of reddit would know.\n\nThis would obviously be a big change, but I don't think it'd be all that difficult to implement, and it would absolutely show that reddit is truly supporting the fight against the NSA, and not just paying lip-service by a cheap, one-line-per-year update. Further, it would allow reddit to inform its users on a case-by-case basis rather than causing panic throughout their entire user-base. \n\nJust spitballing an idea here.

In other words, the smalll (if not miniature) /r/museum community manages to appreciate a more diverse array of artistic styles than the general Reddit community, the latter being composed of thousands if not hundreds of thousands active participants. \n\nFor a while now I've tended to attribute this preference for photorealistic fantastic or celebrity inspired art to Reddit's obsession with STEM and the celebrity culture they appear to both despise and love. Most of the photorealistic art upvoted on the site seems, at least to me, to be devoid of any emotion or even style. It's an exhibition of skill - an extended calculated dedication that produces a fairly sterile but an impressive piece of work that's easy to interpret and appreciate. \n\nThe fantasy theme is probably due to the large majority of Redditors being video game/fantasy fans, and the celebrity theme is self explanatory - as long as it's someone we love - it's fine. However a portrait of a celebrity can also be very unique in style, but instead, we see people upvoting portraits made by copying an existing picture, which essentially make these portraits replicas. And maybe, and obviously I am speculating, it's due to Reddit's trend to hold STEM science above social science. Sciences which leave little place for individual interpretation and emotions are championed, and these preferences might be reflected in the art Reddit so adores. \n\n",

This phenomenon can be observed in the comment sections of iFunny, YouTube and Digg. As the system grows, the quality tends to decrease. New users, ignorant of the real purpose of the system, aim solely for self-validation, by mutual agreement* or by the number system. Notice how the aforementioned sites allow content to be liked or disliked. This becomes worse on reddit, because there is an overall tally of karma, so no widely disliked comment or post exists in isolation.\n\n&gt;What is the overall purpose of meta subreddits? Do they help anyone by noticing the flaws? They allow people to complain about the system while being dependant on this system, fatally unaware of the irony. While admitting every system will have flaws, clearly /r/circlebroke has not fixed much on reddit. Look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3es348/an_update_rpedosexual_has_been_banned_we_did_it/?). Why would you complain to another subreddit about the existence of illegal content when messaging an admin could do the same thing better? Obviously, it's for the aforementioned self-validation, as the need to remove that subreddit was uncontested.\n\n*Mutual agreement is what defines a circlejerk? If there is no dissent, whether through moderator action or by popular opinion, there is no valuable discussion, only repetition of the established viewpoint, ergo a circlejerk is created.\n",
