        "text": "Banks will give you a free replacement card if you just say it was lost. In the inevitable event your card details are stolen or leaked it will be useless data. \n\nThe more practical upside of this is any \"forgotten\" subscriptions you may have will bounce. Gym membership you never use? Fuck them. Audible mega fuck them! Companies that make it a massive pain in the ass to cancel? Domain renewal fees for a domain you registered 2 years ago, forgot about and haven't used in 1.5 years? Not any more! All these companies will inevitably send you an email saying \"we are suspending your account\" at that point you can send them to spam, or log back in and update your details.\n\nKeeping your balance at $0 will force you to transfer the amount needed from your savings into your transaction account. Make the transfer while standing in line, a minute before paying a bill etc. It will force you to confront your balance before each purchase and makes you occasionally rethink spending habits. It also accives every thing replacing your card does. \n\nThese habits have saved me atleast $900 in unused forgotten subscriptions over the past few years, 3 times my card numbers were stolen, one of which they tried to change a $2,500 purchase. I would have gotten it back. . . . In like 90 days. \n\nThings to note:\n1. Ensure your bank doesn't allow overdrafts or change a \"dishonor\" fee. If they do, they will usually waive them if you call up. When you call up you can have them disable the overdraft allowance. If they refuse/can't, find a new fucking bank! \n\n2. Don't do all your cards at once or you'll be stuck with no way to pay for anything till the mail comes. You do have more than one bank account right? \n\n3. This only works for card payments, direct debits will still go through.\n\n4. Check if your bank offers a single use virtual credit card number. This allows you to generate a new number for each subscription/website you use, then cancel the number if you no longer use them. Some banks offer it, but it's very rare in my country.\n\n5. Americans, don't fuck around with delaying updating payment info for the companies that report to credit agencies. You're probably fine unless you ignore that first email from your Telco. Nextflix and the like can't do shit.",

You’re alone. You’re homeless. You’re exhausted.\n\nThere is minimal prospects for getting into a room-for-rent, and you’re ready to give up.\n\nPeople say “move somewhere cheaper”, but your jobs and opportunities are here. Moving means starting over from scratch.\n\nYou’re essentially a nobody, and would earn less than you do now. I guess this could be considered a ‘reset’. But how does it make sense for someone who is struggling to walk away from income and opportunities?\n\n\nIf someone is at the edge of life, how do they know to keep going or to give up?",
