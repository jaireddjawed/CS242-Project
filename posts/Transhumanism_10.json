        "text": "Living digitally is coming. Immortality is very near. If we believe those who promote living in a digital world that it is something that can truly become a reality, how would people procreate? Or is it something that is no longer considered so as not to add more to the population? But I am thinking that people would still want to die sooner or later when they have that option. Get tired of it all sort of thing. So people have to be replaced. What if everyone chooses to live virtually? What of procreation?",

Moments later, we talked about dying and I sorta started talking about mind uploading. One of them said that although it would be an interesting idea, it wouldn't feel like the person (before the transfer). It will be like talking to Siri; it knows the person's entire life and memories but it wouldn't have a soul. It will be like talking to a robot. Do you think this is what it's going to be like when mind uploading is done or that living in the virtual world is going to be? 'Coz that sounds a little creepy to me, tbh. I guess, what I'm trying to say is, regardless of what \"soul\" means to you, do you think that if and when mind uploading became successful, will that person still be who he is before the uploading or will he become your typical robot/clone who looks and talks like the copied person but isn't exactly like that person?",

        "text": "I don't know if anyone has ever addressed this but it's something that bothers me. Let me explain. All my life, well at least since my teen years, I've been thinking about what it means to be truly free. I love individual freedom and I don't really think there is much that is more important. I realized early on that society puts a BIG damper on this. (apologies to any collectivists out there, you probably aren't going to like this post) So when I started fantasizing about being free from the tyranny of age and death it was always as a loner. Of course this is also due to the fact that most movies present it that way. See immortality sounds great when it's just you and a couple of friends watching the ages pass like in highlander or interview with a vampire. You have the ultimate freedom, freedom from the world! You no longer need money or a job. Society and government mean nothing to you! You can go anywhere you want, BE anyone you want. No one can touch you. You can start your life over at the drop of a hat and the best part is no one knows! You are truly set apart, and no matter how lonely you may get you'll always have that. You are special. That kind of immortality sounds amazing to me. That's what I wish I had. Now let me paint another picture for you.\n\nIf everyone became immortal I don't think it'd be nearly as fun. We are all familiar with the concept of generations. X, millenials, Z. Groups of people all born around the same time that sort of have the same experiences, thoughts and ideas. Well I already hate mine. It's become a giant dumpster fire and I'm not proud of it anymore like I was 12 years ago. Now just imagine that the same people you are stuck with in society now are there... forever. You've heard the phrase \"hell is other people\"? It can be true, and now you and your generation are immortal. You will forever be a slave to their judgement and opinions, their laws and decrees. I'd imagine the more time went on the more they'd try to control everything. Rules would be established. Everyone who becomes immortal has to register. No one can change their identity or just leave. Those mistakes you made 300 years ago, yeah those are going to stay with you for all time. Maybe they want to form a type of government you aren't okay with, well doesn't matter what you think. You are at the whims of society now just as you were when you were mortal, only now it will never end. The fickle attitude of the masses will control you for all time. You'll always be forced to pay your taxes and your \"fair share\", whatever people deem necessary from someone they \"let\" become immortal. They might force you to think it's a privilege they bestowed upon you so now you owe them somehow.\n\nOn top of that we have to be a little realistic about this. I don't think being immortal like highlander or some kind of vampire is actually possible. I don't think physics would allow it. Even if you could make it so that the cells of our body continuously reproduce perfect copies of themselves and never degrade, the energy and material for those new cells has to come from somewhere. This means eating and drinking would likely always be necessary. Plus immortality, assuming it actually happens, may come in the form of some kind of drug that you keep needing (though I suppose some kind of permanent genetic alteration could be plausible). This means you still need a job so you can buy the stuff, which means you are forever a wage slave.\n\nNow I'm not saying it'd be all bad. I can see other plausible scenarios. We could achieve amazing things together. I'd probably stick to the outer \"frontier\" planets personally. Explore new worlds and populate the universe, reach post scarcity, live to see all the amazing tech of star trek become reality. It could be wondrous, but that would take a lot of time with a lot of growing pains in between. Plus I think eventually suicide might become a problem. I don't know if people could handle immortality. No one really knows obviously, but it's a theme in a lot of fiction. Time doesn't just take it's toll on the body, but also the mind and the soul. ",

The philosopher and scientist direct their will to power into a will to truth. Artists channel it into a will to create. Businessmen satisfy it through becoming rich. \n\nIt causes a lot of pain because it's insatiable. The best thing one can do to reduce one’s suffering is to find ways to calm it, which is the function of art.\n\nIf achieving worldly power (riches, political standing, various sexual opportunities) was no longer even applicable in a virtual, eternal world which could exist until the death of the universe, such as Virternity proposes, this would essentially make art the only thing left that is worth pursuing.\n\nHow would our \"will to power\" express itself if we could no longer reap the physical rewards of what we sow?

The first is funding, pricing, and distribution and collection of resources. The second is the presence, creation, or threat of an opposition. Lastly, there is the ensuring that as younger generations are growing and becoming members of society able to help with the research and development as well as financial backing, how do we ensure that we can grow exponentially in numbers with this rather than plateau or worse lose ground with a shifting social mindset.\n\nAs a 26 year old with debt and an income not nearly high enough above minimum wage to even feel comfortable in the present let alone looking to the future these all seem daunting and makes the thought of any hope of my mind and consciousness being anything more than simply erased in a matter of years to decades feel implausible at best. I'd like to think this can change but I also look at myself and those around me and feel a great disconnect. I seem to be the only one who not only doesn't want to die today but ever if I can avoid it and that both confuses and scares me. It's why I've decided to reach out here and seek like-minded individuals who are hopefully able to help me either rest easy knowing these things are being addressed, or even just come together and use our collective minds and the technology already at our disposal to change that and address these things. I fear that just living my life and hoping that others smarter and better than I will get it sorted before it's too late for me will ultimately end up fruitless so I guess if anyone feels as I do - how are we going to solve this?",

Like, tendrils growing into the brain, and over the course of months or years, the brain is replaced with an entirely plant-based substitute capable of living for a much longer life span. \n\nIn this hypothetical situation, you would still be you, and your new body would be capable of living for much longer, and it could even be possible for the new plant brain to grow in such a way the memory limitation problem would be overcome.\n\nThis is something that is highly unlikely from what I've heard, but I guess I'm curious to hear what other trains of thought people may have about plant-based solutions to transhumanism.",
