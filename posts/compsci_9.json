You can say, \"I have two sets of search results; I want to use the first from the second set, then fill up with the first set, but if the total is less than six, use results from the second set,\" and it will give working code.\nThe next step of the course is not showing the resulting code to the end user. Have the user just describe what they want and return a black box that takes the specified input and creates the desired results. AI would become a sort of compiler.\nThe major problem with this is that you have to define the inputs and expected results very carefully and unambiguously. So it is best to structure your specifications in a certain way and use words that have a clearly defined meaning.\nThis would end up being a programming language. Current computer languages also use English words that are specifically defined for the context of the language and have a specific grammar so they can be processed\nI would think a new language would be more akin to natural language but still be more, uh, stiff. I would imagine a language similar to legal documents, which have more or less the same requirements when it comes to ambiguity. What do you think?",

But how do you go in reducing others problems to see if it's actually a halting problem? Idk if that can be generalized and I may be irrelevant, I am just curious.

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm a CS grad from India and would be doing my grad thesis this year. My research interests are in cybersecurity and I have already explored some of the areas and have gone through some research papers. My supervisor has suggested the below ideas. So,  I would be grateful if you could look at the below ideas and let me know how I should start implementing them as my goal is to publish a paper at the end of the thesis work.   \n\n\nIdea 1 : \n\nThere are a lot of methods for password generation and cracking. Example, we have hashcat, john the ripper, markov models, adversarial/GAN based models and grammar based models which are used to compare the hashes of a desired password against a dataset/wordlist. And we have standard datatsets like rockyou, ashley-madison datatset, linkedin leaked datasets, etc. But, there is no concrete paper on evaluating all the above models on a standard password dataset and benchmarking these. So, we would like to propose the results of evaluating all existing models on a standard dataset  \n\n\nIdea 2 : \n\nMethods like dictionary attacks use a wordlist that consists of most probable passwords. By comparing this wordlist against the input password, one can crack the password. However, the wordlist size is limited and contains passwords of the entire world. We could customise this wordlist based on regions. Ex: we could create a new wordlist for Indian region, and another one for Chinese region, etc so that the passwords can be cracked much more efficiently (for this we assume that we have the region from where the password hash was collected). And, we could build this dataset and evaluate the results of running hashcat or dictionary attacks on this dataset and prove that this dataset helps in increasing the number of password hashes cracked.   \n\n\nPlease feel free to suggest any other ideas as well in the domain of \"password cracking\". The only concern is that the work should be novel and I'm really looking forward to publish at the end of my thesis.   \n\n\nI would be very grateful for your help !",

        "text": "I am trying to understand how likely a Cyclic Redundancy Check is to fail, given a particular divisor P(x). I am specifically interested if there are an odd number of bit flips in my message, an example to follow.\n\nSome prerequisite info:  \nCRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.  \nP(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).  \nP(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.  \nE(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T'(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.  \nR(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).  \nT(x) is our sent data, (x\\^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).  \nT'(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.  \nWhen T'(x) is received, if T'(x)modP(x)=0 then it is said to be error-free. It may not actually be error-free.  \n\n\nExample:  \nSay my P(x)=x\\^7 +1=10000001  \nLet G(x)=x\\^7+x\\^6+x\\^3+x+1=11001011  \nSo, T(x)=110010111001010  \nWhen E(x)=011111011111111  \nT'(x)=E(x)XORT(x)=101101100110101  \nT'(x)modP(x)=0, a failure.  \nI simulated the results on a particular message(T(x)), namely 11001011, and found CRC to fail 42 of the 16384 possible odd parity bit flips that I attempted. Failure means that T'(x)modP(x)=0. \\\\\n\nThis is a surprising result since I initially believed that all odd parity bit errors would be caught since (x\\^7 +1)mod(x+1)=0.  \nProof:  \nAssume an odd number of errors has x + 1 as a factor.  \nThen E(x) = (x + 1)T(x).  \nEvaluate E(x) for x = 1 ‚Üí E(x) = E(1) = 1 since there are odd number of terms.  \nBut (x + 1)T(x) = (1 + 1)T(1) = 0.  \nTherefore, E(x) cannot have x + 1 as a factor.\\\\\n\nIs the proof wrong, or am I doing my example calculation wrong?\n\n  \nWhat I really want to know is, given P(x)=x\\^7 +1, what are the offs that any general message with an odd number of bit flips will be erroneous but not be caught as being erroneous?  \n\n\nSorry, this is so long-winded but I just want to make sure everything is super clear.",
