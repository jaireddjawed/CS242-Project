We are truly best friends. I haven\u2019t allowed myself to commit anything to him because I struggle with the fact he cannot take care of himself. \n\nHe is financially irresponsible, not someone who seems to invest much into his own life? Like, he has these friends who treat him so shitty and doesn\u2019t know how to cook\/clean and other just basic things. It all gives off the vibe that he just doesn\u2019t think of himself very highly, but just has a heart of gold. Such a kind genuine person. \n\nI\u2019ve cared for him for so long that I don\u2019t think I see things clearly anymore. I feel like we are PERFECT for each other connection-wise, but he doesn\u2019t know how to be independent. I don\u2019t know how to make sense of that. \n\nCould we be happy together like this? I really hate that he seems to find it so difficult to progress in the areas where he\u2019s lacking after so much time. I could easily envision a life together where we made a very happy family together, but I just don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s okay for him to be unable for him to bring to the table.

It\u2019s tough because I have acquaintances and people I hangout with but don\u2019t have an inner circle of friendships to support me and somewhat of a complicated relationship with family.

For instance, I invited a friend out one time who Sam had never met before, and my best friend told me Sam could not stop talking crap about the friend I brought.

Similarly, a lot of us have also been raised to hide emotions from our women and portray a Stoicism and appear as though everything is ok and if we need emotional counsel we should seek it elsewhere. Often in our experience we hear that men are just emotionless robots and should express more emotion but also hear that emotional men are a turn-off and that we should be their \"rock\" and support them emotionally.\n\nOf course, many of these things fall apart in real relationships because we are human too, and even with our best attempts, we struggle a lot emotionally. Especially if you've been with your SO for a while and they can tell when something is eating at you, so ultimately this issue of never showing your emotions to your SO isn't sustainable.\n\nSo I am asking, how is one supposed to navigate this? I understand that there is such a thing as \"tooooo emotional\" and nobody wants to be around someone that falling apart every other day. But often it gets really difficult for us who really do want the support and compassion of our SO, especially when we feel particularly vulnerable, but then are afraid of all the issues mentioned in the first paragraph; losing that Stoic frame, not being the \"rock\", being perceived as \"too emotional\" (which is also subjective and dependent on the feelings of the women at that particular moment). Similarly if relationship problems cannot be fixed due to inability to express emotional vulnerability, well then things just get more emotional more frequently. In which case, why should we even go to our SO for anything to do with our emotions at all? We might as well go to our mothers in front of whom we can cry if it gets deep enough. What kind of emotional support should one expect from their SO when there seem to be so many boundaries and parameters around how emotional we can be?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and experiences because I really am confused and would like to understand better what the expectations are and how to find a common ground.\n\nThanks.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678694530.0},{"title":"What do i do about very thick facial hair?

Unfortunately, my incident happened shortly after a high-profile sexual assault incident at my college that made national news. I mostly kept a low profile and didn't talk to people much ever since I returned to school. It's been almost 3 years, and when I met a group of classmates for the first time, a girl in the group told me that everyone has been speculating that I left because I committed sexual assault or did something to a woman (when in fact my incident had to do with something I wrote on the Internet, so there were no victims involved). I explained to her the truth and she seemed satisfied, but she didn't seem like the kind who would help me spread the truth around. I study at a very small college (1,000 students in total), so probably everyone has heard some version of these rumors.\n\nIs there anything I can do to clear my name in the college community?

Stupid, I know. There were definitely some huge red flags from the start, but I had never dated before and I didn\u2019t really know what was acceptable and what wasn\u2019t. We never officially dated, but we were seeing each other for a little over 4 months. \nI\u2019ll admit that my attachment style (with him at least) was more on the anxious side of things, but I can fairly say I was never toxic about things. I really value open communication and I have no problem expressing my needs. He was very closed off and never wanted to talk about how he felt, or his personal life. \nUltimately, things boiled down to us having different expectations from the other, and different communication needs. I am not the type of person who can go 2\/3 days no contact with a partner and not feel sad about it, especially if there is no heads up or warning. I communicated this to him a few times, and it only made things worse. The problem I\u2019m having is that since this is my first \u201crelationship\u201d, I don\u2019t know if I was being too demanding. \nThings \u201cended\u201d 3 days ago, or at least I think they did. He had never been a huge texter, but in the first 3 months a good morning or good night text was normal, we wouldn\u2019t go a whole 24hrs with no communication, we didn\u2019t text a lot, but a normal amount. Once it happened a few days in a row where I would have my texts ignored for 8+ hours with no explanation, a few times being ignored for a day an a half etc. We talked about it and I said it makes me sad. Big mistake apparently. It made everything worse. So after 2 weeks of this, and 2 conversations about a lack of communication and reassurance, I knew I was done. \nThe issue is, I never sent a \u201cbreak up\u201d text. I told him how I felt and the only response was \u201cWhat?\u201d, so I explained further, to which he never replied. The whole \u201cexchange\u201d began 4 days ago, and I still haven\u2019t heard from him. I know it\u2019s over, I wouldn\u2019t consider being with him, but I\u2019m still sad about the situation. I guess I just don\u2019t know how to deal with the getting ghosted part of things. I\u2019ve not texted him since, and I don\u2019t know if I should, but 0 acknowledgment is making this so hard to not feel sad about. \nSorry if this is incoherent, it feels silly to be so upset about someone who wasn\u2019t a good person to me, but I\u2019ve never dealt with these feelings before.

She has been threatening to divorce several times now, but has not taken any real action (file papers, hire lawyers, sell our assets or take her things). She is not willing to try, go to therapy or do anything to save the relationship.\n\nI've read through many topics in reddit where divorce happened in less than a year and most of those stories had some sort of critical event - infidelity, abuse or addiction.

I was diagnosed with autism when I was 12 and I\u2019ve been bullied for it nearly all my life leading to me just having 3 friends throughout my entire life. Last year I got diagnosed with severe depression and nearly killed myself. So I was happy when I finally made a friend.\n\nI met him playing a game online in September of last year. We kept playing together and eventually we started talking and texting on discord. At first, everything was good but then it slowly started going downhill.\n\nHe started talking about him being depressed and not wanting to live anymore. I told him that it was a too hard topic for me to talk about. He said, \u201csorry won't happen again\u201d. But it did happen again. And now every night he messages me with some version of \u201cI'm sad\u201d which causes the conversation to spiral into him being depressed.\n\nWhen this started I listened to him but the same conversation kept happening over and over again. It doesn\u2019t matter what I say or do because he doesn\u2019t listen. I\u2019m tired of listening to him talk about his depression. I told him to get a therapist but due to him not wanting his family to know about his depression, he can\u2019t get one.\n\nThe cause of his depression is that he can't seem to get a girlfriend and every night the conversation ends up with me being overwhelmed because he says he wants to kill himself. Now I\u2019ve told him I can't help with dating and such because I'm aromantic but he still keeps asking. It seems that he\u2019s obsessed with getting a girlfriend and he's saying that if a girl wants a boy she can get him easily but a boy needs to struggle to get one.\n\nNow he also holds the belief that women have it easier than men nowadays. He says stuff like if a man cries no one cares but if a woman cries everyone takes care of her every need. I told him it wasn\u2019t like that but he didn\u2019t believe me.\n\nHe\u2019s also defended Andrew Tate, saying that Tate has some good arguments. I told him that Tate was arrested for human trafficking but he just says Andrew Tate didn\u2019t do that. And he kept defending Tate. On top of that he said feminism nowadays is stupid and not about fighting for women\u2019s rights, he said feminism was about hating men. He also thinks that women are going to stop needing men and that women will kill all men.\n\nI do enjoy playing with him but this is starting to get exhausting. I need advice on what to do at this point because I don't know if I should keep being friends with him.\n\nTL;DR my online friend thinks women have it easy, defends Andrew Tate, and keeps talking about being depressed even if I told him I don't want to talk about that.\n\nUpdate: So I took your advice and blocked him. I told him about him being a misogynist but he disagreed. He then started crying and begging me to stay when I said I didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore.\n\nI blocked him immediately when he started doing that. In hindsight, I should have realized the toxicity of that relationship long ago but loneliness clouded my judgment. I honestly should have cut off the friendship as soon as he mentioned supporting Andrew Tate.\n\nSome of you said he wanted to date me, now thinking back on it it\u2019s probably true. I had no idea he wanted that. I even told him long before all this that I\u2019m aromantic asexual and that I don\u2019t want any kind of relationship like that.\n\nSome of you said to contact people that can help him, like his parents or the police. I can\u2019t do that because we live in different countries and I have no way to contact anyone close to him.\n\nThank you all for your wonderful advice.

This one manager thinks I'm some na\u00efve dumbass and always tries to flirt with me to persuade me to do larger tasks at work and it's so gross. It pisses me off to no end and it's downright embarrassing. Everyone in the store can tell what he's doing and it's humiliating. He's not interested, in fact, I overheard him and another coworker talking shit saying I was ugly and have bad fashion sense. He's very unprofessional and preys on me.\n\nHe pretends to me nice to my face but behind my back he's an asshole and he thinks I don't know it. I had enough, recently he asked me to mop the ENTIRE store by hand. This is one of those \"superstores\" so the square footage is a lot and I'm the only person available to do the task so I'd be doing it by myself. And he wanted to see if I'd say yes like I was his lapdog. I only cleaned up one part of the store that was filthy by hand and didn't do the rest. I left it. I later told my senior coworker and he told me my manager was trying to take advantage of me and it happens a lot in the store. He told me to be careful next time and not to do it, even if the manager asks. I'm not supposed to be mopping anything *by hand*, we have a machine that does that for us. So this request was downright ridiculous.\n\nI quit that place, just walked out after my last shift and never came back.

There was a closed group that I joined into that was made by a guy \u2014 let's call him Sonny. Now, Sonny was a really great friend who introduced me to a plethora of other people (of all genders), and one of them is the guy in concern; let's call him Richard. \n\nAt first, whenever we would host group calls, it was just between myself, Sonny, and Richard, because the other members were still a bit too shy to join in the conversation. So, out of all the collective members, it's the three of us that were closest. We would discuss everything under the sun; video games, anime, TV shows, books, conspiracy theories, abstract thinking, psychology, philosophy, you name it. But I was well aware that I was a girl in a \"guys territory,\" as this game community is still predominantly male populated. Therefore, I clipped any of their attempts to flirt with me, and became like the \"older sister\" figure since I'm also one of the older members of this group.\n\nFast forward to 2021, I caught the virus, and while quarantining, I played video games with Sonny to pass time and to feel better about my situation. After recovering, all of a sudden, Sonny sent me a private message of his confession to me but it was extremely EXPLICIT. I'm not joking, it was an R-rated confession, and I felt immediately disgusted that he was thinking about me in this manner all this time. I cut off all ties with Sonny, and left the group. I notified Richard of this, and also all of my girl friends (Alexa, Sadie, and Rose; all pseudonyms) that I left the group because of this. They all told me they understand and respect my decision to leave, and that they still would talk to me outside of the group. \n\nPresently, I have been regularly talking to Alexa and Richard at least thrice a month. We would host video calls while playing games, and catching up with each other. Alexa told me she didn't really feel completely comfortable talking to Richard alone, and would only talk to him if I was in the call as well. Now, I understand that, especially after what happened with Sonny. But I never had that \"off feeling\" with Richard. I completely trust him, shared private mental health struggles with him and personal problems. I just feel at ease. But I don't feel anything more for him. To me, he's like an older cousin.\n\nBut two days ago, we decided to catch up just the two of us since Alexa (and the other girls) are currently busy. And he was drinking heavily while we were talking. Now, he's the kind of person who wants to always do video calls when he's talking to people so I didn't think much of this. But I own an iPhone with a really low battery life, and doing video calls while my phone is charging would immediately drain my battery, and shut my phone down. \n\nSo, I explained this to him. At first he was okay with this. But he kept on insisting that I turn on my camera. I was getting uncomfortable already and kept repeating myself that I can't. Then, he suddenly became aggressive and tried to intimidate me by raising his eyebrows and widening his eyes and tellng me there's nothing wrong in wanting to see \"his friend.\" So, I gave in and opened my camera. But he became even more angry at the fact that I wasn't smiling or happy. \n\nThis is the first time I'm seeing this side of him. I chalked it up to him being drunk. But this isn't the first time we would talk while he was drinking. And this entitled behavior is alarming me. So, I tried to steer the conversation back into calm waters, but he wouldn't let it go. \n\nThen, he said, \"we wouldn't even be arguing like this if only you'd go to my country! I know you want to immigrate to another country but why can't you just choose my country? Come here so I can finally see you. I'm NOT trying to be a creep like Sonny, so don't get mad at me! But if only you're here, I'd embrace you so hard, and I get to kiss you on the cheeks. And if you lean in a bit closer to me, I'll kiss you hard on the lips.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm just feeling numb. This IS like Sonny all over again. And now, I feel like I really could only trust the girls. I could really only trust Alexa, Sadie, and Rose. I told Richard that I'm feeling uncomfortable already, and that I'm really sorry about not feeling the same way. Then, he was persistently asking me about my type. At that moment, I just wanted to leave the call. So, I told him that I needed to go. He laughed this humorless laugh, and asked me if we can continue this conversation the next day. I told him no, and that I'm sorry. He said, \"alright. I guess I'll see you in 6 months. Please don't ghost me. I wasn't even like Sonny, I wasn't a creep, okay? Just don't go. Don't block me. I'll give you space but please talk to me again.\"\n\nThe worst part of all of this? \n\nHe confessed his feelings to me while he was seated right beside his lover, Jella. \n\nI don't really know what to do now. I value my friendship with him as he really is a great friend. But I'm afraid this really ruined everything. I don't even know how to explain this to the girls. I also fear that I might be judged by them, they might think I provoked him even though I didn't. Any advice on this would be appreciated.

I (27F) have never been in a relationship and I met a guy (31M) through university. He is a 2nd year PhD student in psychology and I have just started my PhD in STEM. I really like him. He is funny, smart, understanding, open, likes to read, has a similar music taste and seems to be into me. However, as I said, I don't have any experience with guys at all and I am not good at reading into these things or know how to proceed. And I am realising some things about him that I am not sure if they are red flags and I need an external point of view.\n\nThe first thing is that we met a bit unconventionally. I was a participant in his study and we just clicked. After the second time we saw each other he sent me an email about something random afterwards and we started sending emails back and forth. He then asked me for coffee one day and asked for my number to \"send me a song\" afterwards. We have been texting non-stop for a few days now and he is normally the one to start texting. The time span of this has been around two weeks.\n\nAs a mentioned, he is very open. He literally says he wears his shame on his sleeves (direct quote). He has been really open about his messed up family structure and childhood (won't go into detail here cause it's not my story to tell). Also, he has told me about past girlfriends and things he did wrong in those relationships and now feels bad for. I have to say that he does not seem to have any feelings for any of his exes, but just told me about it (if it makes any sense). This does not bother me per se, as I don't really care about past people in his life, but I am not sure if it's a red flag that he mentioned his past relationships already. The main thing that shocked me from this is that he told me that he shortly dated a 19 year old while being 30 and lied about his age (said he was 28 because apparently he got nervous about her being so young). I rolled my eyes at this, told him it was messed up and quoted Taylor Swift... He said he regretted it now and is not sure why he did it. If you ask me, I find it questionable behaviour and he agreed.\n\nAnother thing he mentioned and that it gets another paragraph cause it worries me a lot is that he used to have issues with alcohol. Things like he would finish in his lab at 3pm (instead of at 5pm) to go drink, or that he would do crazy stuff while drunk: loosing shoes, stripping, sleeping at bus stops or bushes, broke up with his girlfriend while drunk (one of the things he regrets now, for how he did it as apparently they were pretty much over by that point), etc. You get the idea. He told me he stopped drinking on February 6th and doesn't plan to in a while because he realised he had issues with it. However, the feeling I get is that this quitting is not forever, just to get it under control and have a healthier relationship with alcohol. It really worries me cause, even though he is trying, it is obvious that he had some issues with it and I am not sure how this process is going to turn out. I probably should give him the benefit of the doubt, but I barely drink and this shocked me a bit.\n\nAnother thing I should add for context is that all of this was told during a normal conversation, not out of the blue. He asked me some questions regarding this and when I asked back he volunteered the information. It was not a weird conversation either, just a normal one where a lot of information was exchanged. He is also very active and goes for walks and swims when he feels really anxious (before he would drink, so positive points for dealing with stuff in a healthy way).\n\nSo, what would you do? Should I give him an opportunity?I really like him and I am willing to overlook some of those things because he seems to be trying to be better and is very open about it, but I am not sure if I am being stupid and I should run. I have already asked a friend and she told me that everyone has a past and that I should give him a chance, that he seems like a good guy who struggled a fair bit and is trying to be better. But I am still unsure. I just don't want to get hurt in the middle of my PhD.\n\nAnother extra question: I still haven't told him that I have never been in a relationship and that I don't have any sexual experience (I haven't even kissed anyone). I know it's still early, but maybe I should have told him already. It really worries me though, specially that he would think that it's weird or something, even if he does not seem to be the type to do so. That's why I haven't told him. At the same time, I want to tell him cause I would be less nervous when I am with him and maybe he would be more understanding. I don't know, it's confusing. I am very independent and never felt like this, so it's a completely different ball game that I am not so sure how to deal with. I also would appreciate some guidance on how to act (like, should I tell him?), as he is starting to realise this: he said I am a bit innocent and the I am not good at this, I guess that he was flirting and I missed it. He said it in a very nice way though and didn't seem bothered at all by this. I have never felt so clueless in my life. I feel so stupid, for real.\n\nAlso, I am not a native English speaker, so I am sorry if I made some mistakes. And thank you so much for everyone who even read this.

Married for 4 of those years. In the beginning, I had quite a bit of my own personal issues to work through that caused a theoretical blindness to much of what and who my husband is. As time has gone on, he's discovered some issues of his own. The problem is, I've been working through my issues and have made many changes in myself as well as how I've handled our relationship. In doing so, I've noticed that while he has acknowledged these issues of his, he's done nothin to fix anything. His not fixing his issues, mainly his lack of communication, is causing major issues in our relationship. I've spent the better part of the last 2 years trying everything I know to help him try to work through these things. He listens as I give unsolicited advice and will occasionally offer some sort of response but typically just responds with a grunt or nodding of his head. He has admitted recently that he thinks his lack of motivation is due to his constant state of denial that the relationship is not good. But still, does nothing. We own our home but have not slept in the same bed for over 3 years and stopped being intimate about a year ago. I recently told him that I simply can't live this way any longer and that we should live as roommates until we both have means of leaving. He has said nothing. I have been living in my own state of denial (that he actually wants to be with me) and seem to be stuck in the hope that it would change with the reality of the potential for divorce looming, but it hasn't.

Using fake names for privacy.\n\nMy boyfriend claims he genuinely blocked this out of his memory and it only just resurfaced, and I do believe him because I've experienced this as well, and outside of this, we have had essentially a perfect relationship and I have no reason to not trust him with this. \n\nA few months before we were dating, we were sending each other sexy pictures\/texts on Snapchat. As it turns out, the first time we ever did that it was actually his friend (let's call him Matt) on my boyfriend's (let's call him Jake) phone. He recalls asking Matt to stop as it was happening but he couldn't grab his phone back since he was driving Matt to the airport. As soon as Jake remembered this happened, he confronted Matt about this last week and Matt confirmed it happened. Jake maintains he asked Matt to help him with talking to me, since he was nervous (and let's be honest, we've all texted crush's on our friend's phones for them before) but he does not remember asking Matt to start a sexual conversation. Matt is insisting that Jake asked him to do this, and Jake doesn't think Matt is lying to him despite having no memory of this. \n\nI found the old messages between me and \"Jake\" (actually Matt on Jake's phone) and 3 years in I feel so stupid. I can obviously tell now that the messages were not from Jake since I know his texting style now. But at the time, we only knew each other for 3 months. In the messages, \"Jake\" was asking me to send specific nude photos and other messages, which I sent because I thought I was talking to the real Jake. I know now that it was actually Matt who was soliciting and seeing all of these photos and messages. \n\nWhen Jake told me this I was shocked. Of course, I first told him to stop being friends with Matt because I no longer feel comfortable around him. Here's my dilemma, I'm obviously hurt by all of this. I feel deceived, dehumanized, saddened, confused, basically like the world just swept the rug from under me. But I also truly love Jake. We've had the most amazing 3 years together and he has genuinely grown so much in the time we've been together. I know 20-year-old Jake would not recognize the man he's become now at 24. \n\nI want to forgive Jake since it is something from so long ago, and he is genuinely not that person anymore. It's hard finding out about this now, when we have so many amazing memories together and I've found so much happiness and peace with him. \n\nHow do I move forward from this? How do I start to find forgiveness? How long will it take? If we stay together am I letting him off the hook? Am I undervaluing myself if we stay together? \n\nMy heart is broken over this and I feel even more shattered thinking this could be the end of us. Any and all advice is welcome. Please don't trash Jake or call him names in your comments, I still love and care for him deeply and I am looking for answers pertaining to myself. Thank you in advance.\n\nTLDR: Prior to dating, my boyfriend's friend went on his phone and solicited explicit messages and photos of me, in an attempt to help my boyfriend start talking to me. 3 years later I find out after my boyfriend uncovers the memory.\n\n[EDIT] Thank you to everyone who\u2019s commented\/messaged me, I really do appreciate your input. For the not so nice people, I just want your advice. You can think I\u2019m stupid, naive, immature, etc. but please I\u2019m just asking for advice and deserve basic respect.\n\nFor those wondering, we are currently taking a \u201cbreak\u201d if you will. We\u2019re long-distance right now and I asked to pause communication while I sort out my feelings. So no text\/calls\/social media messages\/FaceTimes until I feel ready to talk to him about this again.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678144773.0},{"title":"When you (41F) find out your boyfriend (43M) isn't as perfect as thought","author":"StarRadiant6686","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/11k1vhm\/when_you_41f_find_out_your_boyfriend_43m_isnt_as\/","text":"I found out a few years ago, before our relationship, my boyfriend and his step niece exchanged some messages and pictures that were explicit. As far as I know they never did anything further but there were a few family parties they both attended around that time. I heard that at one party she hooked up with a girl and then later in some shed with some guy. She was of age so nothing illegal was done regardless of what all occurred. I know they are not blood relatives but it makes me want to puke as I feel it was inappropriate. It also makes me really uncomfortable thinking about them being around each other now at family events as I am not always able to attend these events. I grew up in a family where I was the step and I would of never participated in anything sexual with one of my step uncles. My boyfriend is for the most part is a great guy but there's some things he's done in the past that just don't sit well with me. Prior to finding out about the step niece, I found out that he slept with his neighbors, who was also his friend, wife. It caused them to get a divorce and while my boyfriend thought she'd stay with him she didn't. I know everyone makes mistakes in life and some do things that are out of their character but the more things I find out the more I feel like I don't know him. I have talked to him about how I feel and he just says he was in a bad place at that time in his life. I am trying to get over things but I keep thinking about them. I find it causes me to be distant and angry at him. I had him on a pedestal because we have had a great relationship and he seemed to have the same moral and values as me. I have had friends who just brush off what's he done and think I shouldn't make the step niece thing a big deal. I feel like I'm wrong but I can't shake how I feel.

A friend of a friend knows him, and thinks they have an \"agreement\" of sorts, but again this has never been confirmed. They do have kids together. When we talk, he has never ever mentioned her, but has mentioned his kids openly. I saw him a few weeks ago and we have been talking daily ever since then.

I am not sure where to go from here, we have not hung out together yet, nothing has happened, but from the way we are talking, something likely is going to happen. The problem is I do like him, and I don't want to be that person, but if he is unhappy, or if he IS in an open relationship, I guess things would be different. I feel awful about it because I personally only believe in monogamy for myself, however I can't deny my feelings. I'm not sure if I should just ask him, I kind of feel like its his responsibility to tell me, because its his relationship.

I live on my own and mainly do everything on my own because I had to for my own mental health. Me and my mother have always had a fickle relationship eve since I was a baby. I don\u2019t know. One minute she loves me, the next she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s almost 58 years old. I recently cut her off because she told me I\u2019m turning into a user because I needed her to sign my FAFSA for nursing school. Technically I\u2019m not legally independent until I\u2019m 24. She is my only living parent. My father passed tragically when I was six. I moved out at the age of 19. I haven\u2019t really asked my mom for much because she feels like the bare minimum is too much and that she \u201chas better things to do\u201d those were her exact words. I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m her enemy but let\u2019s any one and everyone around her use her but they also contribute and enable her behavior towards me. I am trying to set boundaries with her as an adult but she can\u2019t understand why. She keeps saying she never talked to her mother like the way I talk to her. I never once cussed out my mother nor have I been an extreme asshole too her. When I set boundaries and I communicate clearly she feels like I\u2019m being disrespectful\u2026 then she turns it into a HER problem. I don\u2019t understand why black mothers feel extreme jealousy and envy towards their daughters. When she does the bare minimum she feels like she should be rewarded.\n\nI also was trying for us to go into therapy  (she declined) because she hasn\u2019t been the same since her parents passed in 2013 and 2017. Which I understand but she projects her pain onto me.. making me take the mental load of her trauma. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going through my own things and I need the support from her. I\u2019m guessing she is just extremely detached from her \u201cmom\u201d title. She never wanted to be a mom and she feels like she does too much for her kids.

The reasons for this are many - school\/workplaces that are predominantly female, shyness, lack of interests that men share, and a good dose of long term depression and PCOS. I don't think I am unattractive but I'm not stunning. I look after myself and make an effort. I have a good full time job and lots of varied interests. I don't get approached in public but whatever.\n\nAlthough I have always felt like the odd one out regarding being forever single, I feel like this has cranked up a notch in the past year or so - with reaching 30, pretty much all of my friends are settling down\/buying houses\/buying pets\/getting married etc. I have never felt so left out and excluded - I can't even say anything in conversations because I have nothing to add. The entire world seems out to constantly remind me how alone I am, how difficult it is to be single in a world designed for 2. Conversations always drift towards weddings, houses etc with my friends, even my few single friends. A few weeks ago I attended a weekend away with FIVE couples and one other single woman who I didn't know, and it was painful. I was left out of conversations and no one seemed interested in talking to me. To make it even worse, some of my friends just kind of brush it off anytime I express sadness over my situation - I know it's awkward and no one knows what to say, but I'd just like a bit of reassurance from them!!\n\nBut then in contrast - I can't even make a start with dating. I have used dating apps for years, gone on a handful of dates but I absolutely HATE it. I don't feel any attraction towards 99% of them, I can barely muster up any interest in them, whenever I get a match I absolutely dread receiving messages and trying to keep up conversations. I went on a date last summer and I felt physically sick for like 4 days leading up to it and I couldn't pinpoint why. On the date he tried to put his arm around me briefly in a completely natural and friendly way and I froze and felt so uncomfortable. The rest of the date was fine but I had to cut it off and told him I was having trouble dealing with dating and needed time out (which he was nice about). I just have no interest in dealing with online dating but there seems to be no other way. I've spent 15 years 'doing hobbies and activities' and 'putting myself out there' so I can't deal with anyone telling me to do that anymore because it just does not work.\n\nSo I don't particularly like or want to be single, but I can't deal with doing anything to change that? The anxiety absolutely destroys me, but so does the loneliness. My lack of experience feels so humiliating, I barely feel like a proper woman at times. I am definitely attracted to men in some way but I don't know how.\n\nI know I need therapy, but what can I do now?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678126952.0},{"title":"my boyfriend (m19) is a far-right, religious, conservative, conspiracy theorist. i (f19) am willing to compromise, for our future, he refuses. how should i handle this? is there hope?","author":"chronicnostalgia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/11jwmxa\/my_boyfriend_m19_is_a_farright_religious\/","text":"this post may end up being very long but i will try my best to keep it short and answer questions below for more context and explanation. all relationships are nuanced and complex and i am sure there will be many details i miss that i am happy to answer to after the fact.\n\nmy boyfriend (m19) and i (f19) have been in the same friend circle for 6 years. we had never been PROPER friends, as i always had a bit of a crush on him and he was a teenage boy focused on his friends and video games.\n\n2 years ago our friend group began to grow closer and i found a great friendship in him. after a few months, in february of 2021, he kissed me. from there, we had gone on a few dates, had sex multiple times (we were both virgins at the time) and eventually fell into a relationship. it was like a dream come true.\n\nat the time of us getting into a relationship, i knew he was somewhat religious. (his faith is christadelphian). i had always known his family attended church and more often than not, he would go too. i knew he never swore and would occasionally travel interstate to see his extended religious family and friends. other than this, he didn\u2019t express anything that i felt were red flags.\n\nafter a month or so, we had some big discussions where he expressed he would like me to involve myself in his church and check out out to see if it\u2019s something i like. he told me that he dates to marry, and although many people do find themselves dating outside of the religion, it\u2019s preferable that his partner is at least interested. i had been raised without religion and would consider myself agnostic. at the time, i had just started to really educate myself on politics and philosophy and found it all quite fascinating. his ask seemed reasonable to me and i was honestly very eager to learn about his faith and educate myself further. religion has always been something i have wanted to learn about, but i find it overwhelming at times and this seemed like an approachable opportunity.\n\nso i began attending his church (or as they called it \u2018the meeting\u2019) nearly every sunday. i would say at least 3\/4 sunday\u2019s a month. it was definitely confronting at first, but i felt welcomed and it was genuinely interesting. obviously i had heard many stories of cults and grooming and keeping this in mind i made sure to stay grounded and keep a distance between me and the church. but it was enjoyable! i didn\u2019t have an intention to \u2018convert\u2019 and i made this clear to my boyfriend, but if i found myself convinced and the faith formed, i wouldn\u2019t be opposed. i\u2019d embrace it and nurture it happily.\n\n(note: i am not saying that his religion IS a cult, i only mention this to assure you i understood what i was getting into)\n\nanyway\u2026 at this pace this post will be far too long so i\u2019ll get you up to speed.\n\nthroughout our relationship, we would have arguments but only ever about politics and they were more like friendly debates. his positions on the lgbt+ community and feminism made themselves more apparent (he didn\u2019t think it was \u2018right\u2019 but would use the right pronouns etc, and that he saw feminism as \u2018anti men\u2019) but he was always patient and seemed curious to learn more about my side of things. his ideologies concerned me and i told him this, but we had 6 friends in our 8 person friend group that were out as gay, trans, bisexual and non binary and he seemed very comfortable spending most of his time with them. we both knew we disagreed on these topics but i think both of us felt the other would \u2018come around\u2019, and i felt we could make peace with it and find a happy middle ground to function in if neither of us were to change.\n\noutside of politics, our relationship was good. he had never dated anyone before me (i have had one 5 month relationship, one 1 year relationship) and he was still very clearly learning how to be a boyfriend (we barely ever call, he was ignorant of romantic gestures, took a while to learn how to reassure me and vice versa) but he was always trying his best. i will admit, i have been treated better before, but his lack of effort and action wasn\u2019t to do with his lack of love or care. it is clearly a lack of experience and i felt it was no use to follow the \u2018grass is greener\u2019 mentality and ditch the connection i had with him in hopes of someone who bought me flowers and posted me on social media etc. i had considered it, but that has passed for me, things are improving and i am sticking it out as he does make me feel loved to the best of his ability right now.\n\na few other notes:\n\n\\- i have struggled with generalised anxiety disorder for my whole life and the past 3-4 years i have dealt with an eating disorder, body dysmorphia and ocd too. i see a psychologist for this and am taking medication. it\u2019s improving slowly. this was also taxing on him and our relationship and another reason for me sticking it out as i felt i couldn\u2019t ask for more (he is wonderful in supporting me through anxiety attacks etc)\n\n\\- he has a porn addiction that he refuses to seek therapy for. i have tried to help and refer him to resources but he believes he can \u2018will himself out of it\u2019. the use of porn does seem to waver depending on his religious guilt and guilt regarding me, but when he is watching it its instagram models, hentai, fetish stuff etc. this has been an on\/off concern.\n\n\\- during covid 19 he was heavily influenced by his family (particularly his mother) and is now very much anti-vax, believing in all the typical theories. i am unvaccinated due to his concern for my fertility (he told me it was my choice but he would be worried and it would \u2018cause problems\u2019 in our relationship. i caved, lost my job and hid inside for a year and a half)\n\n\\- he has eluded to loosely believing in some conspiracy theories (fluoride in water, distrust of western medicine and doctors) but claims they are just \u2018interesting\u2019 to him and \u2018make sense\u2019.\n\ni am sure if you are reading all of this you are probably thinking \u2018why in the world is she with this idiot?\u2019. i understand. i have heard it all. i do not have an excuse and i do not think i am doing the \u2018right\u2019 thing if i stay with him. all i can say is that i feel i am not in a position where i am stable enough to leave him. mentally and emotionally i am unwell and i don\u2019t know how i would handle it. this might not justify sticking by him but i can only share my perspective. i do want your opinions but please understand that i am not ignorant of the issues here.\n\nnow we get to my main concern and breaking point. recently we had a conversation in which he expressed his concern with me spending so much time with our lgbtq+ friends. he said he likes them and i can do what i want but it does \u2018worry him\u2019 and he wishes i had some \u2018normal girl friends\u2019\n\nthis was incredibly upsetting to me and i expressed my discomfort. he didn\u2019t have a lot to say other than that i can do what i want but he just doesn\u2019t enjoy being around them as much since \u2018all they ever talk about is gay stuff\u2019\n\ni was hurt and frustrated trying to help him understand, but his misconceptions seemed far too ingrained in his core values and character and i eventually gave up. we made up and he moved on. it kept weighing on me.\n\nlast night we were spending time together and another debate style conversation arose. we began talking about his faith in relation to lgbt+ identities and i tried to get an answer out of him about how he justifies the lack of utility in his arguments. he kept dodging questions and didn\u2019t seem to have the vocabulary to express himself. he got frustrated with himself and resorted to explaining points that had nothing to do with what i was asking (explaining history of bible etc). i eventually just started asking direct questions because i was sick of the ego and lack of accountability. i wanted to get a CLEAR position from him.\n\ni won\u2019t run you through the back and forth s but this is the general idea:\n\n\\- after i asked directly, he admitted that he would be pro conversion therapy \u2018but done properly\u2019 and believes that it works even though i tried to show him the evidence proving otherwise.\n\n\\- he said he\u2019s more about preventing trans and gay people from turning out \u2018that way\u2019 and thinks it\u2019s to do with soy milk, social and media influence etc.\n\n\\- i then asked him even if that WAS true (which it clearly is not) what would his solution be to help the current trans and lgbtq+ people in the current world. he didn\u2019t have an answer. other than to \u2018not flaunt it\u2019 and to \u2018not be PRIDEFUL\u2019.\n\n\\- he expressed he thinks incest and bestiality is wrong because the BIBLE condemns them not because of the harm done\u2026 however believes that part of the reason gay people are \u2018wrong\u2019 is because it\u2019s harmful? i\u2019m not too sure about that one but he has shaky framework for his arguments to say the least.\n\n\\- for all of his points, he couldn\u2019t provide any evidence (re conversion therapy, soy milk etc) but i asked for him to send me some.\n\n\\- he essentially admitted that he wouldn\u2019t believe there exists ANY evidence to prove utility in supporting lgbt+ or other things condemned in the bible. and even if there was, he would still believe in gods word because it\u2019s \u2018right\u2019 and he knows best. he couldn\u2019t answer directly what he\u2019d do with that evidence and how he\u2019d disprove it\n\n\\- he kept using the word \u2018unnatural\u2019\n\nthen ultimately, i asked him what he would do if our kids were gay. he told me he wouldn\u2019t go to our kids wedding if they were gay and said that he would \u2018love them and support them\u2019 but wouldn\u2019t \u2018encourage it\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t want them to flaunt it or be proud of it. he also blatantly said he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with our kid having a gay relationship and wouldn\u2019t see their relationship as legitimate or real.he insisted he could be \u2018respectful\u2019 and once they\u2019re 18 they can do what they want (either choose to stay in church or leave or \u2018proactive homosexuality\u2019, transition etc) but he wouldn\u2019t be \u2018happy about it\u2019 i asked him if he would compromise on this and he said something along the lines of: having the intention to support something that is explicitly condemned in the bible is worse than \u2018accidentally\u2019 or in the moment sin. he would very likely NOT compromise on these things but insists he is \u2018open\u2019 to learning.\n\nthe conversation ended with both of us crying for a while, holding each other and him insisting \u2018we will make it work\u2019.\n\nIMPORTANT!!! (rest of context in comments)\n\ni suppose i\u2019m wondering\u2026\n\nis it worth sticking this relationship out a little longer and attempting to help him out of this hateful mindset? is that even a possibility?\n\nis there a best way to approach our next conversation?\n\nhow much should i compromise until this becomes borderline controlling\/toxic?\n\ni\u2019m so sorry for the very long post, i hope it makes sense to you all and please ask questions below if it\u2019s too confusing.\n\nTDLR: my boyfriend is far more conservative that i initially realized. i am happy to incorporate his faith into our future family, but he refuses to love the members of the lgbt+ community in our lives\u2026 including our potential future children. i want to leave him but i want it to work out more. is this possible?","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678103162.0},{"title":"(29m) My wife (28f) has been treating me differently and it\u2019s getting worse.","author":"RedNeckSkeeter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/11jrlsx\/29m_my_wife_28f_has_been_treating_me_differently\/","text":"Over the last couple of years my wife has started acting differently towards me.

If he's tired I understand and I don't mind him sleeping at all, it's just I feel like he chose the time he was awake to play his video game with his friends rather than spend time with me. For more context, he usually works 3\/4 days out of the 7 days in a week, and his off days tend to fall on weekdays, which is when I have class, so he plays games almost all day on his weekday days off already. He always tells me that I'm more important than his game, but his actions don't match what he's saying.

I'm not that guy, and I would definitely go with them if I had to as I'm lonely in this world (deceased dad, mom lives in europe, no siblings). And my GF knows that I'm not that guy. But her sister doesn't listen to her and everyday I see my GF getting sad of it. She says she's doing her best to manage that problem and our relationship, but I can feel she is also getting sad of letting me down. She's so grateful for my comprehensible behavior, but I can't say that I'm OK with it. I never had anxiety issues in my life and always says that I'm the most peaceful and centered person in the world, but now almost everyday I feel that one day she is giving up on us and lost all the control over my mind and life. I cried so much today when she cancelled our date for her sister after they argued. And I can't tell that to her because she trusted me into her heart for seeing me as a safety house for her insecurities, what she couldn't have in the past.\n\nI just wish to know if I'm not alone. If someone had similar problems and love won in the end. And if I should interfere, tell personally to her sister how care about my GF and that I would never spoil their future, as I'm not an egoistical person... I just can't stand that I could lose her for other people craziness.

I learned from a friend that he went there with said friend the week before. I really didn\u2019t think it was a big deal that he went at all, and I would not have cared if he had mentioned it. What I do care about is that he lied to me.\n\nAfter a very long conversation where I tried to understand why he lied and what was going on, he simple confessed that he just wanted to eat at the restaurant and he was just being selfish and lied to me about it just because he thought it would be \u201ceasier.\u201d I was extremely clear that this behavior is not ok and not something that I am comfortable with, and he genuinely seems remorseful and equally confused about why he lied. I genuinely believe that this isn\u2019t a habit - he\u2019s a bad liar, and this case proves it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out that he lied.\n\nThe thing I need advice on is how to handle it from here on out. I have a lingering nasty feeling about how he handled this. I want to be constructive and get past this, but I\u2019m not sure how to think about what happened in a way that is healthy.

I have since moved and we talked a lot still.\n\nHowever, over the past few months she's been getting more and more stressed with her home and work. Now everyone gets stressed and that's part of life. However I can see her sinking. She's repeatedly told me that her mental health is deteriorating but she refuses to elaborate further. \n\nNow I'm not entitled to knowing about anyone's personal life. But she also refuses to confide her problems to her friends. Saying she doesn't want to bother anyone and no one owes her anything and people shouldn't expect her to be happy all the time. She's had a rough childhood and her family who live with her aren't supportive so she's learnt to stand on her own two feet all her life.\n\nI tried to get her to talk about it but she just says \"I'm not a project to fix\" and \"you're not my therapist\". I'm well aware of both those things and I'd honestly rather focus on grad school. I asked her to confide it some of her friends if she wasn't comfortable with me and she declined that as well saying she didn't know what was wrong.\n\nNow I know that I can't help someone that doesn't want help. I want to let it go saying it's none of my business (which it isn't). But it's been 3 months and she's getting worse. I can hear it in her voice and the way she talks. She's grown more distant. I'm scared that she's going to crash and burn. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\n\nTL;DR Friend struggling, cutting everyone off.

The first two dates were pretty chill outings, but we spent the third date at my house. We cooked, watched films and talked for hours - to the extent that he rescheduled his plans for the next day because he said that he didn\u2019t want to leave. We spoke about where we were at, and concluded that both of us were open to seeing where things go but aren\u2019t closed off to a relationship. He stayed the night, we slept together and parted ways the next morning. We\u2019d usually let each other know when we got home and that sort of thing, so I sent a text thanking him for coming and telling him that I had a great time. I hadn\u2019t heard from him until midnight and he said he also had a good time, and asked if I\u2019d made it to work okay. I responded when I woke up and once again didn\u2019t hear from him for the entire day. I assumed he was busy. He\u2019s not a great texter, he typically responds within a few hours but there have been a couple of longer spells. I get it, though, people have lives. \n\nHaving touched on what we were looking for but not really clarifying how we want to go about things, I decided to send a message the following day saying that I\u2019ve enjoyed spending time together and I just wanted to get an idea of where his head\u2019s at, if seeing each other works and fits within his expectations and if he wants to continue. He said he\u2019s loved our dates and loves hanging out with me but presently he isn\u2019t in the space for anything serious, but he would like to continue exploring things between us. He asked where I was at and I told him that I\u2019m happy exploring our connection as I\u2019m learning to navigate dating, and commitment feels slow and steady for me. I told him that I understand his perspective and I would like to keep hanging out if it aligns with his headspace. \n\nIt\u2019s been three days and he hasn\u2019t seen the message. I don\u2019t plan to send another as I don\u2019t want to be pushy, but I\u2019m not feeling particularly confident and I\u2019m worried that I was too much. To be honest, the idea of being ghosted after sex spooked me a bit - so I feel like my anxiety may have killed things. Should I keep waiting around for a response, or just move on?\n\nTLDR; Replies from a guy I\u2019m seeing got spotty after the third date.

Due to our schedules we managed to go out 2 times and they were both perfect. Both of them suggested by me, but that didn't bother me since her vibe was very good: both of the times she was working late and had to wake up early but we were staying late talking and kissing and the second time we even slept together. In other words she was not initiating our dates but she definitely was trying to be with me as much as she could and we were having a great time.\n\nAnd now the hard part of the story: At Wednesday I texted her to suggest a cooking date in my house. She agreed and when I asked her about her schedule, she said that at Friday she didn't have to wake up early, so I proposed Thursday as the date night. She basically ignored this text and replied in the following one that I said I hope I don't get sick because of a party I went to recently (different story). Anyway I thought that meant that she agreed on the date and we kept talking but something was slightly off; she was ignoring stuff that she would otherwise pick me about or comment on them. I just thought she had a rough day as she came back from a trip at Tuesday and she was working long hours. However, come Thursday when I asked her if we are still on for tonight she said that she has been crammed with work and she couldn't make it, which is understandable since I know she works a lot, but there was no offer for reschedule! And as I said before she had a pretty hectic schedule in both of our previous dates but that never stopped her. Anyway, I replied with \"it's fine, get some rest and we will reschedule when you are more chill\" and she just hit \"love\" in my text. We haven't spoken again.\n\nNow I know there are 2 paths: Either she texts me again and it's fine or she doesn't initiate anything. I am here asking for advice for path B. I mean I know that probably the odds are against me but I really felt a connection with her and I can't leave it there, I want to try once more. I know (or maybe I hope..) that this connection was mutual and that she had a great time as well (from the way she was talking and smiling and the future plans she was proposing) and I know that it's not a good indicator that she didn't offer a reschedule and it maybe is a problem that she doesn't inititate and she is not as expressive as me. But I really like her and I think I have to try, just to be sure (maybe it was a bad day or maybe I scared her off and she wants to take it slow) and to get an explanation.\n\nWhat is your opinion in this? Could this \"dreamy\" thing be on my mind and she just got bored? Is it a bad idea to text her? How long should I give her since I lose hope of her texting me? And if I text her what should I even say? \n\nTl;dr Had a great time and an awesome connection with a girl for 3 weeks. She cancelled our third date with no offer for reschedule and I am afraid she won't try to initiate. I want to try again though but I don't know how and I don't know if I should.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677942570.0},{"title":"I (26F) am convinced my boyfriend (27M) has a thing for our coworker even though I can\u2019t prove it","author":"Low-Solution-7579","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/11hxg0q\/i_26f_am_convinced_my_boyfriend_27m_has_a_thing\/","text":"Just wanted to start by saying I know I am the one in the wrong.

Ever since I asked and she said no, I've never heard from her again. It wasn't meant to be a date at all. I thought it would've been super casual. But I thought wrong. I asked her once and left it at that. \n\nBe as honest as you can here. If it's bad, at least I won't need to imagine the worst. If it's good, then good.

What can I do to make it better? Are these thoughts valid? Do I come off as a creep with all I've rambled here?\n\nTLDR; socially anxious dude, scared of women, and talking to them.

And I feel betrayed and hurt\n\n \n\nWe went on camping trip, it was my first time meeting his friends (group of 10). I am an introvert and it took me years to be able to go hang out with his friends in a social setting. I went with an open mind, I was nice to everyone. They were nice and kind to me too. But he has this one friend,  Jack, who showed up late and was very weird around me to begin with. \n I knew he has a drinking problem but he was sober when he first arrived. We all sat by the fire, talked. I said hi, introduced myself and smiled like I did with everyone. He couldn't be bothered to have a decent conversation. He was just cold. \nLater around midnight my fiance came to the girls tent to say goodnight. He was checking up on me, I was in a tent with his sister and female friends (strangers to me) . He wanted to make sure I was ok, and we stayed up talking for 40 mins, and Jack kept texting him, how he's taking forever and is not joining the party. He left shortly after many text messages\/calls. I said go, it's not polite to keep people waiting.\nI just thought he was being missed by his friend. \n\nNext day, we went to the lake, and me and my fiance we wanted to walk around, sit and talk by the water, we left the group for about 30 mins. As soon as we came back made snarky comments, rolled his eyes, just really immature actions.\n\nLater that night, we were drinking by the fire, playing games and Jack was very rude and hostile towards me every chance he got infront of everyone. \nI casually mentioned to  friend sitting beside me that I don't feel as drunk and he yells, \"that's cause you're not drinking bro\"!\n\n\nI let it slide a few times but he kept going. My fiance was holding my hand to show his support but it was really getting to me. I excused myself to go the bathroom, my fiance and his other friend followed me to make sure I wasn't hurt by Jack's comments. I told them I was fine and to not make a scene, it was our last night there, I didn't want to ruin the mood. I was secretly crying in the bathroom and with my fiance. But everyone else saw what happened and came to me to say don't take it to my heart and just let it go and made excuses for him, about how he is drunk and that's just how he is.\n I just said being drunk isn't an excuse to be asshole and hurt people without reason. I was the new person in the group, I am dating his friend, and alI he did was act entitled and bitter. I knew nobody and he was just so disrespectful from the very beginning, without even knowing me.   \nI was really hurt and mad. But i had to pretend to be fine for my fiance as Jack was his friend but I wasn't ok at all. \nNext morning, as we were returning, I told my fiance I don't ever want to be in the same room as Jack is, I don't want that negativity around me. He said, yes that won't happen. \n\nBut 2 hours later, we had to stop at subway to get food and Jack came and sat at our table. Not wanting to make a scene again, I kept my cool. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 saw how upset I was, I said I won't attend his social events again. He said, he will hang out with Jack less and won't even see him as much. He told me, Jack killed what friendship they had. But didn't confront him. I was fine with it, I took his word for it.\n\nI realized Jack told others during the trip how my fiance was acting different with me being around and wasn't giving him much time. He was literally bit**ing like a lil girl.\n\nSince then Jack broke up and is been sad and my fiance feels bad for him and is hanging out with him more often, celebrating his birthday, drinking together. He says Jack had a rough life and isn\u2019t a bad person. He seems to have forgotten how disrespectful he was to me and is now buddies with Jack again. \n\nI have told my fiance how I don't like Jack and won't be around him but I never stopped him from hanging out with him, even when he said he would do it less but still hangs out often. I have mentioned, the more you hang out, the closer you are going to get and he's going to be more involved in our lives. He says, yeah dont worry i will handle it. He is just a very social person and want to be friends with everyone.\nThey are hanging out right this minute and I can't help but feel betrayed and hurt. Like me being disrespected and hurt by HIS friend didn't mean anything to him. He just moved on and pretend like nothing happened. His friend was rude to me infront of his entire group yet no one said\/did anything instead made excuses for him and now even my fiance, the one person who's supposed to have my back is out drinking with him knowing how disrespectful he was to me.\nI just realized I will never be ok with him being friends with Jack. It's just a constant reminder of him not having my back and not standing up for me, that he is totally fine with his friend walking all over me.\n\n\n\nTldr: fianc\u00e9's friend disrespected me infront of his entire group for no reason. Fiance did nothing and pretended like nothing happened. He hangs out with him often even when he said he won't.

Because of pandemic restrictions, and some personal matters, I was forced to hunker down and try to pick up the pieces of my life on my own. I was absolutely devastated, and the abuse had left me emotionally and mentally shattered. I was lucky enough to get into counseling, and I've stuck with it through this time. However, in therapy I started learning more about myself and the people in my life, and started to realize how much toxicity existed in my closest circles. I basically had to rebuild my entire self and my entire life.\n\nTo protect my healing and hard work, i made the decision to restrict access\/go no contact with several of those relationships. Almost overnight, I lost several close friends, and most of my family, because I no longer felt safe leaning on them for emotional support. Between the ages of 19-26, I have lost 4 very close (besties, talking every day) friendships and every single time is as devestating as the last. At this point, I'm exhausted by the mere thought of trying yet again to make friends\/meet new people\/be social. I am dating a new guy, but we live in different towns and I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable leaning into his life (due to my last relationship being very codependent, I prefer at this stage of my relationship, to maintain my level of independence) so while that relationship is great its not meeting my needs for female companionship, I want friends outside of my bf. I miss having sisters and a mom to go to. I know the importance of close relationships outside an SO, and that's the loss I'm feeling so incredibly hard right now.\n\nAt this point, I spend most of my days alone. I do the same routine. I've tried focusing on old and new hobbies, I've lost 50 lbs changing my diet and exercise routine, I go for daily walks and journal, I meditate, I'm still in therapy. The depression and grief is STILL. So. Bad. The nights are really hard, because that's when I notice my phone is so silent, and my head is so loud.

So when we got back together I didn't tell them in case things went not so well. Safe to say we stayed together, and this caused a problem because I was \"sneaking around\" to go and see my gf. I then started to try and move out with my girlfriend, cause she wanted to escape her house where her dad was pretty abusive, and I wanted to leave home because my mum was setting unrealistic rules(be home by 8pm week nights, which basically gave me an hr with my girlfriend on any particular day, which I wasn't able to see more than 3 days a week). So we moved out eventually after my parents stopped me a bunch of times. When talking to my parents to keep everything above board and basically give them the decency to know what I am up to and keeping our relationship at least in tact, my parents, particularly my mum, said some pretty bad things about my girlfriend. Which I probably shouldn't have told my gf about. \n\nAnyways, that leads me to this point. My girlfriend just doesn't want to see my parents, and a couple of nights ago broke down because she didn't see a future together because of my parents. \n\nI want to change this and so do my parents. I particularly want to change this because I don't want to lose my family. My brothers and my dad, and extended family are all really good, and I love them. My mum is hard to deal with, and she just makes everything so hard.\n\nMy parents really want to see me happy, and so does my girlfriend. But my gf just doesn't come to see my family at all, what can I do to get her to come with me?","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1677704025.0},{"title":"How is it possible that my (23f) partner\u2019s (28m) ex girlfriend\u2019s hulu is logged into our brand new TV?

It\u2019s pretty nice.\n\nAbout a week ago he mentioned to me that his ex gf\u2019s hulu is somehow logged into our brand new TV. He looks excited but hesitant like he\u2019s waiting for me to be the first one to suggest using her account since we cancelled our own subscription a while ago. But instead I\u2019m just like *why is it logged into our TV?* did you get her login info? He said no, that he never talks to her and he has no idea why it\u2019s on there.\n\nHe says they only talk if he gets a piece of mail for her here or back when they shared a phone plan. They have also caught up a few times since we\u2019ve been together via text. From what he said, they are on good terms which I think is awesome. I brushed it off as whatever, I don\u2019t care, we have free hulu now.\n\nBut I was thinking some more about it when I turned on the TV this evening and I can\u2019t stop, ugh. It\u2019s weird, because we ran into her a week prior at the laundromat. \nI instantly recognized her from pictures but didn\u2019t say anything. But my boyfriend pretends to not see her, and she just avoids us for the few minutes we were all in the same room together. \n\nI thought this was odd because he said that they are on good terms and have talked on occasion. When I talked to him about it he basically said he didn\u2019t want me to feel uncomfortable and didn\u2019t know I recognized her so i\u2019m assuming he just felt like it would be a useless awkward encounter we could all avoid. No biggie, I get it. \u201cHey OP this is my ex girlfriend!\u201d Something like this definitely would catch me off guard, and he knows I have social anxiety.  But then a week later her hulu pops up on our brand new TV and I just think it\u2019s too weird of a coincidence. \n\nI like to think that I don\u2019t make a big deal out of things but I just have this feeling that he\u2019s lying and either \n\nA) reached out and asked for her login or \nB) has her password memorized and just added her account to our Tv but was too embarrassed to admit to me that he\u2019s \u2018freeloading\u2019 or didn\u2019t want to upset me. \n\nI have a problem with both of these possibilities because they are both lies and really I just don\u2019t know what to do. Could it be her account is just recognized by our wifi or something? They used to live together. \nI feel crazy and I hate that this is such a minuscule thing that I can\u2019t get over. \n\nThoughts? Thanks in advance for reading my mess.\n\nFWIW: I would absolutely not mind if they were In contact, and he knows this. He was basically a second dad to her kid so I\u2019d get it. What I\u2019m upset about is that I feel like he\u2019s lying because it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.\n\nupdate: just saw our TV is logged into her Disney+ as well.\n\nupdate 2: Roku automatically synced her logins on our TV because she has her TV registered under his roku account.

This is not a first rodeo for either of us. My husband is a really nice person and gets me me in every aspect. He is very horny in general and loves to spend time with me.. buys me gifts.. cooks for me.. helps in household chores.. basically everything I can ask for except the time in actual intercourse. He barely lasts for 3\/4 seconds means 3\/4 thrusts. Sometimes may be 7\/8.\n\nI have also seen his kindle with ebooks on how to be better in bed. I know he knows this issue.. we have never talked about it openly. He doesn\u2019t go down on me and generally our sex ends once he is done. I sometimes ask to use the vibrator which he happily helps with. But the real issue is I don\u2019t know how should I talk to him or discuss this with him. I want to make our sex life better. Recently we talked about having babies but I think that will be end for us with sex as I don\u2019t know how going down on me will be once we have the baby..\n\nNow the question is; what\u2019s should I do ? How to talk about it. Any suggestions?\n\n\nUpdate1 :\n\nOk.. after seeing all the comments I decided to talk to him about it. As I had expected he was upset with the chat but he took it positively. He was like - I knew this was coming. And he is perfectly fine to explore all other stuff options. He also suggested if it\u2019s okay we can see a doc to get a perspective. It definitely took a load off my shoulders. Thank you for the supportive and motivating messages. \n\nOn the side note - I\u2019m from a rural area of India and generally here people in relationships don\u2019t talk about or give much attention to female orgasm.. at least that\u2019s what my friends have told me or what I have seen in general in family. But I have everything in this relationship and didn\u2019t want o lose him over this. \n\nAlso, not sure why do people become insensitive with their comments. Anyways thank you for your support and I think I\u2019m good now.\n\nUpdate2: \n\nJust to add some more context. Ours is an arranged marriage where we didn\u2019t know each other well before marriage. Just met couple of times and then got married. This is a common practice in India unlike western countries. Divorce is considered not a welll accepted event. And I don\u2019t want to separate.

I\u2019m having a hard time finding people who can relate to this experience, so please direct me to any relevant communities or feel free to message me if you relate. TLDR at the end because idk how to be concise lol.\n\n\nI\u2019m 23F, and growing up I was the fat girl. In short, I was bullied throughout school ages 9-14 because I was chubby\/had bad teeth\/wasn\u2019t attractive, whatever. You can fill in the blanks. My parents also contributed to the issue, with my mom giving me slim fast shakes or telling me I couldn\u2019t wear bikinis\/tankinis to swim because \u201cgirls like me can\u2019t wear them.\u201d When I wanted to join a gym, my dad told me it was good because I would be better at sports, but he didn\u2019t want me to be skinny because \u201cthen boys would like me and find me attractive and he\u2019d have to worry about them actually coming around.\u201d These are just a couple of many, many examples.\n\nI went to all girls high school so it wasn\u2019t so much in my face, but I never got asked to dances or asked on dates. In college, I mainly hung out with my group of guy friends because I was always labeled as one of the guys. It felt backhanded to me, because I am a woman. While I appreciated having male friends who I knew liked hanging out with me for my personality, I kept taking hits to my self esteem because no one seemed to like me romantically or physically.\n\nWhen I was 21, I got diagnosed with a couple medical conditions and started focusing on my health and self love. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight and started taking better care of myself and have a lot more confidence. \n\nThe issue is that now I\u2019m being noticed by guys- they compliment me or ask me out and I genuinely feel shocked every time. It\u2019s becoming a problem because at 23 I haven\u2019t been in a relationship or had sex because I\u2019m so afraid of rejection. It\u2019s what I always experienced and internalized it. No one understands because if I complain about having no experience, they tell me it\u2019s my own choice and I could \u201chave so many guys\u201d if I wanted. People I\u2019ve met recently who didn\u2019t know me before my \u201cglow up\u201d assume many incorrect things about me and it\u2019s frustrating.\n\nThere is a huge disconnect between how people perceive me (conventionally attractive) and how I see myself (the same girl I\u2019ve always been). I\u2019m in therapy trying to figure it all out but I wanted to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar and how you cope. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to adjust to having a \u201cnew identity\u201d when I feel like the same person I\u2019ve always been, just a more true version of myself.\n\nTLDR: After spending the vast majority of my life being treated\/perceived negatively due to being overweight and not conventionally attractive, I\u2019ve had a glow up and people treat me wildly differently. This messes with my self-perception. I don\u2019t know how to transition from the low self esteem\/treated negatively\/gets zero game past version of myself, to the confident\/treated positively\/getting male attention current version of myself.\n\nThanks for listening :)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677537351.0},{"title":"(30F) I'm having a real lazy day 1st day of period cause pain, anyone else do that ever?","author":"sadpoetgirll","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/11dq9l0\/30f_im_having_a_real_lazy_day_1st_day_of_period\/","text":"I (30F) started last night and I'm in soooo much pain.\n\nI'm feeling guilty about not getting work done today (I'm currently job hunting after graduating school) - it's Monday and I should have worked all day, but I'm curled in bed because my cramps are so bad.

This guy loves me;\n\nbut I'm not sure I love him anymore. I do love him, but I just can't feel it anymore. I think about it all the time and it's eating me up because it's unfair to him. To be honest, I don't feel much anymore at all. Most things I thought were cute or I didn't mind honestly bother me now. I get snippy with him and annoyed all the time and try my best to suppress that.\n\nThere were some things wrong. He didn't listen when I asked him to stop calling me names as a  \njoke\" (ugly, fatso, etc). He gets angry a lot and never takes it out on me, but drives aggressively and is pretty loud almost making it seem like it's directed at me. I told him who I was as a person and that I won't be as outgoing as he would like me to be; it has been brought up multiple times that its hard to talk to me (and it is, I'm not a big talker, and try to connect in other ways) but is only upset because 'other couples can talk for hours on end and not get tired). It's not like he's emotionally abusive but there are major flaws that I think have not helped me lose my 'in love' with him.\n\nThere are great things as well; he's the first person I truly was happy with.

I do not feel like being in a relationship when I was, was the best timing for me, and it just has gotten worse. It feels very hard to tell him these things because he's a very judgemental person and he has down-talked (in general, as in other people with these issues) these issues. I'm going to get diagnosed as bipolar and I feel like I can't tell him because of his views on it. He thinks it is just crazy and I've always tried to educate him. I have grief-related trauma, I have attachment issues, and I can't open up. I just know he also needs someone better than me as much as he loves me. I don't want to be selfish. It's hard for me to connect to him. Nothing feels bright and sparkly to me.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some stuff but you get the gist of it.

Our relationship started seriously deteriorating around September. She has always struggled with mental health and depression which has gotten a lot worse in the past year. She hasn't gone to school since November, she's not allowed to live at her mom's house because she's \"too negative\", and recently all her friends have started ignoring her. They always make plans with her to \"cancel\" them and then go out without her. It's so sad to see.\n\nHer depression has put a real toll on me over the last 2 years. It's stressing me out like crazy, and it's honestly getting worse now with her friends leaving her because she has gotten 10x more needy for me. It's something I can't deal with because I absolutely need alone time and I feel like I can't say no when she want's to hang out because she gets sad and complains about having to be alone. I have tried talking to her about this which resulted in a one month long argument, it's something that usually happens when I try to bring something up about our relationsship that I don't like or want to fix. The constant fighting made me loose even more feeling for her.\n\nI have realized that I always slightly dread spending time with her, and I always feel relieved when she goes home. It's not that I don't care about her, because I really do, I'm just burned out. She still does her best to be a good girlfriend and she is really loving to me, but I've still lost feelings. I feel so bad about it.\n\nThis is my first relationship so I've never broken up before, but it just feels extra difficult since she has no one to support her when I do, plus with her current state of depression and suicidality it just feels even worse. All I can think of is the thought of her lying alone in her bed crying while holding her stuffed animals because of what I did, but I also feel like I can't stay in this relationship any longer because of the pressure it is putting on me and I am already burned out. I want to be single again and just focus on my own things for a while.\n\nI apologize for the long read, but I would love some advice if you have any for me.

The Dates I had ended up being not what I'm looking for and mostly bad for me. So I gave up dating almost 3 years ago to focus on myself, find out what I want in Life, deal with my past, identify my problems and other key things. During that time I had to realise that my past left some bigger scars, caused mainly by broken trust by false friend and Dates, sexual harassment by mostly women in public, being used by \"friends\" to benefit them and being left alone when asking someone for help with my Problems. To cut it short I need more time than most of us when it comes to building up trust. Additionally I have a hard time when it comes to body contact everything more than a hug makes me feel uncomfortable.\nThis leads to my question what your thoughts on this issue are if you would be dating someone with the same problems like I explained. Maybe you even have some advice on how I can explain that to a date without taking her interest in me.\n\nTl:dr I have a barrier while dating that makes it hard to build up trust and deal with body contact, due to things happened in my past.

It recently ended and I need advice.\n\nBackstory: We are from the same hometown, predominantly white area. We met in 6th grade homeroom. My brother and his sister are the same age, and his mom taught my brother. We connected in high school, liked each other. He says he liked me but I felt like he was an asshole to me. We talked for a bit but he told me he couldn\u2019t date me because he couldn\u2019t date anyone black. It hurt but I left it alone and moved on.\n\nSince high school we\u2019ve remained friends on Snapchat. Over the years, he\u2019s reached out to me but I continued to blow it off. In Dec 2021\/Jan 2022 (10 years after talking in high school), he\u2019s hitting me up more frequently. I ask why and he finally tells me that he likes me and always has. We start talking, long distance situation. I am in Ga and he in KY. We would meet in TN every few months. We would text every day and talk on the phone almost every day. Sex was good! We had our differences but I know I care about him, showed him, and reassured him of that. I\u2019ve helped him with his resume, given career advice, advised him on how to set boundaries with his parents, encouraged him to continue his hobbies (creating beats, podcasting with friends, editing videos - to name a few). I want him to be his best self and succeed in life and was willing to do anything to help him with that. He made me feel comfortable, made me laugh, and everything felt genuine. \n\nA year into us talking, I ask \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be with me eventually\u201d just to get an idea of it being a possibility in the future. He says he doesn\u2019t know. I told him I didn\u2019t want a title rn and just wanted to see if he could see something with me in the future. After that convo, he started acting weird towards me. A week later he finally says \u201cI really don\u2019t want to hurt you. It\u2019s not that you\u2019ve done anything wrong. You\u2019ve been absolutely amazing and supportive of me. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do without you tbh. I just don\u2019t know what I want right now or in the future. I don\u2019t want to lead you on when I have no clue what I want. I still miss you, like you, and want to see you, but it isn\u2019t fair to you. I\u2019m really sorry\u201d. I feel like a dumb ass for even bringing it up. I cried myself to sleep afterwards and continue to beat myself up for letting him back in, for asking, for having sex, for not being able to accept this and let go. \n\nI think about the future but I don\u2019t get hung up on it.

He made me feel like crap for not knowing, just for him to want to end things under the guise of not knowing. \n\nI want him to understand that I\u2019m okay with how things are. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t know. We\u2019re essentially the same in not knowing exactly what we want. I don\u2019t want to lose him and do want him in my life tbh.

I have spent so much money going to see him and I did anything for him bc he made me feel really safe. \n\nFast forward to the last time I went to see him. He had to go on a work trip two days later so I knew he would be busy. Which I was cool with, of course. But then at one point for some reason my phone wasn\u2019t getting his texts or any texts from androids (I have an iPhone) but at the time I didn\u2019t know that so I thought he was ignoring me which was not like him at all. So I messaged him on messenger and he\u2019s like I\u2019ve texted you so many times you can\u2019t be mad when I just texted you and didn\u2019t answer for ten minutes. He then sent me a screenshot of our conversation and he did text me so I sent him one showing that I wasn\u2019t getting them. We kinda laughed it off but he still seemed irritated. We were on the phone and I asked him if we were good and he got mad which is also not like him and says \u201cI\u2019m saying this nicely now, but in the future idk if I\u2019ll be able to. If I\u2019m not answering, I\u2019m busy. You can\u2019t get mad at me for that.\u201d And was just really short with me. It bothered me but I was just like I guess I would be annoyed too but he was acting different. \n\nBefore that, there was a few times when he didn\u2019t answer for like 14 hours bc he would get home late from work and go to bed and I didn\u2019t know that bc we don\u2019t live close and I would say like I hope we are ok and when he would wake up he would be so reassuring. But really we never fought or had anything like this happen. \n\nSo, I just said ok I understand and let it go. But then he just started acting different. He used to text me a few times if I was working and didn\u2019t answer. Nothing crazy just like saying he missed me. Now just very few texts, never said I love you first anymore, just very short and dry texts. He then said it was bc his dog had puppies and he breeds them so he\u2019s been busy with that. But then it got to the point that he would sometimes read my messages and not respond and he never called me. But we would talk at least a few times a day. I asked him about it on multiple occasions and he said we were fine. Friday morning I ignored his messaged and so he texted me a few times. So I called him and said this is just hurting me I feel lonely in our relationship. He said it would get better and he was good until yesterday afternoon and now he hasn\u2019t talked to me in 24 hours. I tried to call him once and I\u2019ve messaged him a few times.

A few months ago I noticed I would get left on delivered for hours whenever my bf was playing a video game and it bothered me. It got so bad my bf recognized how little he was texting and apologized without even me saying anything to him first. To fix that problem, we decided itd just be better to call. Now, he facetimes me often and I really appreciate that. And he says he likes talking to me on call but once he's gaming (he usually games for at least a few hours every day), he usually doesn't talk very much to me at all. I almost always have to initiate the conversation and sometimes I have to say his name two or three times for him to respond to me. And when he does respond, its often just a few words or a hurried reply. This kind of made me feel like he was ignoring me for his game and that him not responding meant he was annoyed with me. After I told him this, he told me that this wasn't the case at all, he's just focused on the game and that it's hard for him to game and respond to me at the same time. Since the game he plays has nonbattle and battle time, we came up with a solution that I'd talked to him when he was gaming and not in a battle but once he was in battle I'd have to wait to really talk to him. This solution seems to be working and I'm okay with it, but I just can't help but feel like I'm second to video games almost always. I don't want to be the type of gf who's like \"It's either me or video games\", I just would appreciate the feeling of wanting to be talked to. He tells me that sometimes he likes calling me just so that I'm there with him, not necessarily to talk a whole lot. And I like calls like that too, but I kinda feel like all of our calls now are just these type of calls where we barely talk and it makes me feel kind of lonely even though he's right there. (And when we're not on call we're both at school or work) I want him to enjoy the things he likes to do obviously and this solution we found is definitely better than how things were before so am I being too sensitive about feeling second?

I didn't know what to say or how to act I just tried to comfort her and listen to her, she got up and gave me a hug and cried and I told her she needs to go home even if she doesn't feel useful there it would be best to be with her family so I got my boss and explained the situation to save my friend from walking around work with tears as I know how that feels and I just wanted to do anything to help.\n\nI realised that I felt emotionally invested, compromised, it was an awful feeling because I felt like I shouldn't feel like this.

She broke up with her ex almost 1.5 years before we started dating, and dated another guy in between for a couple of months. But she was in touch with her ex even after they broke up. Their relationship lasted for almost 4 years after which she decided to end things. There were multiple reasons for ending things one of the biggest was that it was a long distance relationship. She felt very drained and misunderstood at times and decided to split up. However she still wanted him to be a part of her life since they knew each other so well.\n\n\nWhen we started dating she told me that they would hang out sometimes and that I should know this. She also told me that she did not want to date him and that she was over him. However we both knew that he was not over her. And when we started going out more he became possessive sometimes, this led to both of them not talking to each other. \nI had asked her in the beginning of our relationship if she still had any lingering feelings for her ex to which she said that she had none. ( And i do believe her) \n\n\nAs a few months went by she would sometimes feel guilty for not giving that relationship another try. Her ex would make her feel like she didn't put in the effort when she could have. He would also tell her things like she is wasting her time and that he will wait for her. It got so bad that he once told her that he is looking for more ways to end his life. \nMy gf was clinically depressed and he helped her through that, and when all of this was happening she felt even more guilty that she is unable to help him and that she is one of the reasons why he is at this state.\nWith all of this happening moving on became really hard for her. She was trying everything she could to give our relationship a chance but any small event would trigger a memory which would death spiral into a guilt trip. \n\n\nA few days back she told me that almost no day goes by when she doesn't think about her ex and that she thinks that she still has feelings for him. It was heart breaking to listen to those words. Although this hasn't been a very long relationship, I have never felt this close to anyone in my life before. She truly is a very genuine and beautiful person. And I do feel that I have put in my all to make this work. \nShe also told me that I could break up with her if I wanted but that she needed some time alone to process what is best for her. \nI want her to be happy, I know her well enough to see how difficult this situation has become for her. I don't know if she'll make the right decision when it comes to her happiness because she is so heavily influenced by her ex. All her friends think that she should go back to her ex and that is another reason why she thinks she made a mistake by coming into a relationship with me. \n\n\nFrom what I know about her ex(which comes from all the incidents that she has told me) he does not look like a person who would be right for her. But anytime I try to communicate that to her she feels as if I have a biased opinion because I am her boyfriend.\n\n\nPersonally, I care about her enough to let her decide what is good for her. But I don't know if she'll make the right decision because she is clouded by all this guilt and attachment. What is the right thing to do since this is taking a toll on both our mental healths and I don't want her to suffer any more than she has.\n\nTldr: my gf told me she has feelings for her ex, who she broke up with almost 2 years ago.

For context in this friend group she is mainly close to me, and I am close to everyone in the friend group. \n\nOur friendship has changed recently and I feel like she is copying me. If I recommend my favourite authors or book series to her and my opinions on them she will repeat my same opinion to others as if it\u2019s her own. I mentioned a tattoo I wanted to get and it\u2019s placement and the next year she got that same tattoo I described. I dyed my hair red a few months ago and she texted me asking which hair cut she should get. Both cuts were similar to mine and she ended up dyeing her hair the same colour, referencing an old IG post of me, saying \u201cwe have the same hair now!\u201d Which I didn\u2019t find odd because most people dye their hair red. But, when I told her my hair faded to a diff colour she seemed disappointed. I normally walk one of our mutual friends home and when she found this out she insisted on walking her home instead and grabbed her by the arm, separating us. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of these actions until recently. I thought I was blowing little things out of proportion. There have also been many other similar instances. I was most suspicious recently when one of our mutual friends and I decided to return to college. This friend is finishing a bachelors program that they dislike. And when she found out we were applying to college, that very same night she applied to all of the same programs I had applied to. She also completely changed her career trajectory to exactly what I was pursuing. Overnight. It seemed like a very impulsive decision and I didn\u2019t want her to base her future on a whim in case she loses motivation while she\u2019s in the program. From speaking to some of our mutual friends, she doesn\u2019t act this way towards anyone else in our friend group.\n\nLately, I feel strange towards her and have put some distance between us. I know that friends will start to pick up each others habits or be influenced by each other but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s to this extent? Am I just inflating my ego? Or does she just have a lack of self identity? Should I confront her or just continue to distance myself?

Then I happened to visit the same city 2 weeks later so I suggested I see him as well. We had such a great time then as well. Then I had a long weekend and suggested I go visit the city again just for him (I have free flights so not a big deal for me) and he wanted me to. This time was really nice and we were hanging out like bf\/gf. \n\nThen, we had a FaceTime on Valentine\u2019s Day. Great call lasting 2 hours and when I brought up visiting again his face lit up but he told me he wanted to clarify with me that \u201cI swore to myself after my last long distance relationship that I would never do it again\u201d and \u201cif you lived in my city, things would be different.\u201d \n\nI decided to visit him last weekend for a 24hr again, because I wanted to, and not because I think I can or want to change his mind. I know that this guy likes me - he tells me I\u2019m really funny and beautiful, sends pictures of me to his friends, cuddles in front of his roommate, and we have GREAT sex like 5 times a day. But I also believe he doesn\u2019t want to commit to me, and I\u2019m slowly accepting that. \n\nHe\u2019s still messaging me on many platforms without me prompting him to.\n\nSo finally, do I just slowly stop responding? I feel rude doing this and I am comfortable calling him to have a talk, maybe he even deserves that but I\u2019m not sure. If I were to call I would say that I\u2019m not interested in keeping in touch or visiting him again if he sees no future between us. And that I\u2019m not interested in trying to change his mind about long distance. However, calling does give me hope that he would reconsider things.\n\nI\u2019m just really unsure of what\u2019s the expectation for communication. Hoping that someone better at communicating can tell me what they would do.\n\nTDLR: In a city an hour flight away from my home, I met a guy at a bar, then saw him 2 weeks later when I happened to be in the city, then I visited him twice but he\u2019s not interested in long distance. Hard to ghost because he keeps messaging me, so not sure if I should call him and if so, what to say, because I really like him.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1677157531.0},{"title":"my best friend (30F) is obsessed with her new s\/o and i (25F) love that but now i've been sitting by myself for around 3 hours by myself because she's been talking to her s\/o on the phone and i'm at a loss at what to do?","author":"damptoastonfire","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/119kief\/my_best_friend_30f_is_obsessed_with_her_new_so\/","text":"this is half rant half asking for advice. one of my best friends of over a decade recently got out of a bad marriage and has started dating her new s\/o. it's important that i note that her and her s\/o are long distance because...well, it's what makes me feel like an asshole for being annoyed. they don't see each other often (literally different countries), but they talk on the phone every day. which is great!!! i'm so happy for her and how she's gotten a new light to her; it was obvious that her old relationship was a huge burden on her. being in this new relationship has transformed her a lot! that said, one of my pet peeves is when people talk on their phone for a whole conversation (like not just a quick convo, like a *conversation*) while with someone else; or generally just using the phone for elongated periods of time when hanging out with someone else. i think it's rude and i've definitely made it clear to everyone who knows me that i find it incredibly annoying. replying to a text or something is totally fine, but when it's to the point where y'all are barely hanging out anymore...what's the point?\n\nmy friend and i don't see each other often. i'd say around 2-3 times a month? since getting into a relationship, it's almost every time we hang out where she says \"hold on, i have to call s\/o\" and then has an entire conversation with her while i kind of just sit there. it's annoyed me and i definitely did stop asking to hang out because i felt like i was begging for friendship and she was kind of just along for the ride. but she does ask me to hang out as well, and so i decided that she's taking initiative so it's fine. initiative shows that she cares, right?\n\nanyway. cut to today. we've hung out for most of the day, as we were traveling. however, she has been consistently texting her s\/o and has done short calls (mainly because her s\/o was working). but we were traveling and i was the one driving, so fair enough. once we got to our lodging, however, we sat down and i thought we'd be working together because we both had a couple hours of our work day to complete. then, she says, \"anyway i'm going to go call s\/o. i'll go to the bedroom so you don't have to hear us\" and then went. it's been roughly 3.5 hours that i've been sitting out here by myself. honestly, i feel defeated. it's not like she thought i was busy--she came out multiple times and i was literally laying there doing nothing. the first time she came out i thought she'd propose doing something together but she just needed something from the living room.\n\nthis is all to say: i'm conflicted. it's been a long time she has been unhappy in her ex-marriage and it's been a long time since she's put herself out there. she's so happy with her new s\/o and makes so much effort to see her and i love that! ldr can definitely be difficult, but i think they really care for each other and it makes me so happy to see that she's happy. i know i'm lucky to say that i get to spend 3-5 days a week with my partner. that said, i can't help but feel disrespected. i get that this is a ldr and that they can't see each other--but they talk on the phone every night for hours. i see her for a couple hours 2-3 times a month. is it selfish to ask for maybe 1 full day of actual attention and respect? i get the honeymoon phase and i'm praying, begging god, that this is what this is but i'm so exhausted of feeling unwanted and unworthy of time. before anyone says to just call my s\/o--my s\/o and i don't like to talk over the phone for long periods of time when we know the other person is with someone else...because it's rude. even if we could do it at the same time--what would be the point in even hanging out?\n\nanyway. how would y'all feel in my shoes? would you be okay with it? would you not?","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677115872.0},{"title":"My (24F) boyfriend (26M) photographed his female friend half-naked without telling me in advance.

We bought our home in 2019. Since then my MIL (F\/70s) has come to stay twice a year. She stays for 2-3 months in the summer and 1-2 months around the holidays. During these stays she spends most of her time at our home in the guest room. She spends some time with her daughter or nephew. This was never formally discussed, just something that was expected? We have a 3 bed\/1 bath home, so we do have the space.\n\nShe recently sold her home in another state after we bailed her out of some major financial trouble. We are building her an in-law on our property and break ground soon. She is paying for this with the money from her home sale.\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s a decent guest. She cooks, helps clean. Here are my major issues- she\u2019s a bit of a mooch and consistently overstays her welcome. \n\nFirst problem- the mooch. She is constantly asking me for weed. She\u2019ll take my pre rolls. She\u2019ll ask to roll a joint and literally takes a gram to smoke to her face. We live in a state where this is recreationally legal. There\u2019s 3 dispensaries within a mile of us. If we go out\/order out, we\u2019ll ask if she wants anything. Without fail, she\u2019ll get the most expensive meals and never offers to pay. Last time we went out, she ordered a seafood pasta dish and two glasses of wine, while my partner and I got burgers, 1 soda and a cocktail. No problem ordering what you want, but when someone else is paying, being considerate is nice. Her bill was the same as the cost for myself and my partner.\n\nNext is the overstaying, and this is a big one for me. It\u2019s happened every single time she has come to stay. Most recently she was supposed to be here for \u201ca few days\u201d, she stayed for 10 days. And, honestly, if she had just said that she intended to stay 10 days, it would have been fine. She was supposed to leave on a Saturday, when we asked what time she was leaving, she asked to stay until Monday. She never actually asks to stay either, she waits until someone asks what her plan is to extend it. It drives me up a wall. I\u2019m a planner, I like a plan. I don\u2019t like not knowing when she\u2019s leaving.\n\nI feel like an awful person because she\u2019s on her way to stay for a \u201cfew days\u201d again and I am totally loathing it. She\u2019s my family, I would want someone to accommodate me if I needed help. She won\u2019t ask for help though, she just takes. I don\u2019t know what to do.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677088509.0},{"title":"What if I [25f] love my boyfriend [34m] but don\u2019t always like him?","author":"BerendBootje3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/119bd8e\/what_if_i_25f_love_my_boyfriend_34m_but_dont\/","text":"Hi!

One of the most crucial things I want to focus on is my personal life.\n\nMy 20s were a little rough, and I was very severely depressed and directionless for most of it. I struggled with interpersonal things, finding it difficult to make or keep friends or deal with romantic relationships.\n\nFrom my late twenties to the present, my life has improved. I'm doing well at work and I'm generally well-liked by my colleagues, and I make a good (if not amazing), grown-up salary that allows me to live by myself in a small apartment in a large, high COL city. I take care of myself and I'm on top of bills and all that good adult stuff. I'm aging pretty well. I'm generally on top of things, which is not nothing given what a hot mess I was in my younger days. I'm still a little isolated socially, which I'd like to correct, but I have a few friends here and try and go out sometimes (I especially enjoy arts-related things).\n\nThat said, there's still a lot of work to be done, particularly when it comes to romantic relationships. I've had a bunch of shorter relationships lasting from 4-8 or 9 months over the years, with one somewhat longer relationship that lasted 1.5 years. I've never gone through a period where I slept around. There were lengthy times where I didn't attempt to date because I was embarrassed how shitty my life was. I've never been married or had kids (indeed, I have no desire to have children) - I don't think this is such a problem, but I feel weird about the fact that I've made it this far in life without ever having a serious, years-long romantic relationship that involves cohabitation. At this point in my life, it's something that I want and regret that I haven't yet experienced.\n\nI'm sure that this will come off as a red flag to a lot of women, and I don't blame them.

I [22M] have been talking with this classmate of mine [24F] at my school for the past month or so. We started talking on a Thursday evening when we were introduced by mutual friends at a Trivia night. The following evening was our school's gala where we had a great time together and danced the whole night. She ended up spending the night at my place where we chatted, made out, but didn\u2019t have sex. When we woke up the following morning, we had a little breakfast date together and found ourselves doing something together everyday for the next three or four days (studying, going to the gym together, etc.). \n\nUnfortunately, I got covid after the gala and wasn't able to see her for 10 days. During that 10 day period, she informed me off-handedly that she had just been broken up with around Mid-January, and that she felt we were going a little too fast, and should have let me know earlier. In hindsight, the 10 days were a great reprieve from each other and were a nice little restart.  \n\nHowever, when the ten days were over we made plans to get brunch the following Sunday and picked up right where we left off. We had a blast, ultimately spending nearly the whole day together, and I left thinking that I could see myself in a relationship with her. She has initiated us getting dinner together the last two days since then and we've studied together during the days. \n\nIt feels that we are doing relationship stuff without having a label or anything of the sorts.\n\nI would like to know, would y'all recommend I wait a few more weeks, pull the band-aid off, and just ask her \"what are we,\" or should I let her bring up the topic herself? I was advised by some friends that I may come off a bit like \u2018pick me\u2019 and a little desperate. What\u2019re your thoughts?\n\nIf you can't tell, I have very little self confidence from previous relationships and waiting too long to ask the question in other casual relationships I've had.

In the beginning, he had a slow response time but would write me absolute novels of texts, a near intimidating amount of bubbles. I happen to love texting and his style of enthusiastic attentiveness so I thought of it as a cute quirk. He maintained this once or twice a day attack of texts consistently, for about 3 months. It wasn\u2019t *exactly* my style but it helped maintain us. He always knew I was more of a real-time texter but I rolled with it and he rolled with me. We also managed to see each other twice a week.\n\nMonth four has been rocky communication-wise because he started drowning in his work. He\u2019s a first-year lawyer at a huge firm and his oh, I\u2019m working all weekend became a \u201cI\u2019m definitely working 7 days a week.\u201d His style is basically let me text her back once I wrap up, which is proving challenging because it takes so long to wrap up. That could mean texting me Monday about a potential Wed date (everything is up in the air because of his schedule) and then not circling back until Wed morning, even if we\u2019re in the middle of a conversation. \n\nI\u2019ve experimented. I\u2019ve tried keeping texting shorter but it doesn\u2019t matter what I text, if he\u2019s busy, he will try to finish up what he\u2019s doing and write me later. It could even be a response to a meme that takes 24-48 hours. This is a deeply engrained thing and apparently even an improvement. Apparently, some of his friends in high school would tease him for responding to now irrelevant texts a whole week afterwards. At this point, this is who he is.\n\nOur band-aid of sorts has always been 1. quality time 2. phone calls. The issue is that quality time is just hard to come by with someone who needs to work 7 days for at least the next year to pay his dues. We now either see each other once a week or once every two weeks. We may call once a week if it\u2019s the former or twice a week, if it\u2019s the latter. We are both pretty determined to keep dating because we really like each other. I think of it as an investment because I know I\u2019ve been a high priority from the beginning and things are slowing down because they just have to, not because he wants them to.\n\nMy question is: how in the world do we stay connected? We\u2019re still building right now and he\u2019s obviously doing his best under crappy circumstances while being, I should say, the most high functioning and balanced guy I\u2019ve ever met. He will relish a long run or an opportunity to cook himself dinner even as his \u201cme time\u201d on another Saturday at work. I also fall under the category for his little bit of relief. I don\u2019t think calling every day would make sense for him and to be honest, it\u2019s not my preference either. I\u2019ve never dated someone half this busy.

She was texting him for most of the time when we were on her date, the only time she didnt was when we were in a theatre with no reception. She responded instantly to him even though she hardly ever responds to me. I know for a fact he liked her because before i was dating her they made out at a party (he was still with his gf at the time). I know i might be being overly paranoid but its funny how he only tried to become friends again after he got dumped.\n\nYesterday, she was hanging out with who she said was her (female) best friend, and they were having drinks, I texted her that i was going to be busy with work to which i got no response. 3 hours later i get a call and she is drunk and is not with her female best friend, but with the guy instead, they are drunk together watching a movie. She then proceeded to hang up on me as soon as he started speaking and when i asked what was going on i still had no response.\n\nShe has said many times she would never cheat on me and wouldnt want to make me worry, but between her very sporadic and dry texts and her having her guy friend who she used to like over I cant help but doubt the sincerity of her words.\n\nThis is my first GF and i really want things to work out since i really love her a lot so does anyone know what I could do here to ask her whats going on, I really really dont want to break up with her.\n\n!TL;DR, My GF has been getting more distant and I think it might be because of her guy best friend but I dont wanna be paranoid, any advice?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676924274.0},{"title":"Is my boss (50M) flirting with me (21F) or is he just very friendly and social?

Her mother is a huuuge POS (narcissist) so her great grandma, who we call our Mimi, and great grandpa, who we call Papa, was basically her real parents. I grew up with them and loved them but obviously my mom had a deeper connection to them than I did. \n\n\nPapa died back in 2019; I was only 16, dealing with undiagnosed depression and being bullied every day so I didn\u2019t really process the grief in a normal way. He had dementia I guess but I never really noticed besides him losing weight. He still seemed like my Papa. My grandma put him in a nursing home which I disagreed with, and he ended up dying due to shitty care I think. But I was a kid and had zero input. The funeral really fucked me up because I begged not to go and still had to and was forced to look at things I didn\u2019t want to see. I ended up having a panic attack and throwing up in the parking lot next to my dad. \n\n\n\nThe weirdest part was that we were most alike. He had the same humor as me and the same traits I did, and I feel like that made my mom even sadder. \n\n\n\nI hate people being upset and feel the need to fix problems, so I always try to make people happy even if it\u2019s impossible. It just makes uncomfortable I guess.\n\n\nAnyways, so basically my mom has always taken deaths the hardest. She\u2019s very emotional so I try hard to comfort her but that oftentimes will come at the sacrifice of my own well-being. I feel like knowing Mimi has dementia too is going to make her feel awful. I talked to my best friend about it and how I feel like we should\u2019ve just let Mimi die. I know that\u2019s such a terrible thing to say but she\u2019s been depressed since her husband died and clearly doesn\u2019t want to be alive as much as she loves us. I don\u2019t see the point in letting her live, genuinely. But again, I have zero say. She has mild dementia, which I\u2019m not going to argue with. I think she\u2019s fine but I also am an optimist. She still is happy to see me, she knows my name and while she forgets some stuff I feel all older people do when you\u2019re almost alive for 90 freakin years. But again it\u2019s not my thing to argue with so whatever.\n\nI just worry about my mom. I\u2019m not saying my great grandma is gonna die anytime soon (who\u2019s to say), but I know when it does it\u2019s gonna be fucking brutal. My mom is going to be distraught and I will not be able to go to the funeral (I know this seems rude on my behalf but I just refuse to go through that trauma all over again). I just want to make sure my mom isn\u2019t super distraught like she was with my Papa when she became suicidal. And it makes me worry- will my parents also get dementia, and will i be in the same position as her sooner or later? The thought makes me sick to my stomach. \n\n\nI just want to know how to help her and what to expect. Will mild dementia get worse? How can I best support my mother? And how do I handle the worry that this will happen to my parents when I\u2019m older?","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676783230.0},{"title":"My partner (25M) uttered a racist slur while sleep-talking - what should I (22F) do?","author":"Amethyst9358","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/116tt83\/my_partner_25m_uttered_a_racist_slur_while\/","text":"\\[CW: racism\\]\n\nHi everyone, \n\nPosting this under an alt because I am so worried and don't want to explicitly call anyone out yet.\n\nI really love my partner and we tend to be always on the same page politically.  I'm white and he is also white fyi. Neither our conversations, nor his general reactions to political issues ever made me think he was anything less than progressive to the bone, there were no red flags whatsoever. However, recently something happened that changed all of that. He has a habit of talking in his sleep. Usually his sentences don't make sense, as is the case with other people who talk in their sleep. But last week, I  was first waking up, and he was sound asleep, and seemed to be moving a lot in his sleep - I thought he was in a bad nightmare so I decided to check in with him as he sometimes struggles with bad dreams. When I sat up I overheard him mutter something that sounded vaguely like the n word so I leaned in to listen and he kept talking and I swear he again said the n word clear as day. It was enough to make my blood run cold and I had trouble falling back asleep.\n\nThe next morning I mentioned to him that he thrashed around and muttered a lot in his sleep and asked him if he remembered what his nightmares were about and he said that couldn't remember anything about his dream . \n\nI am not sure what to do now. He has never said anything remotely racist to me or any other person in the real world - he has never said anything problematic to me regarding race before, not even joking or accidentally and I have known him for years. However, the incident has kept me in a nervous tension and made me question whether he really is the person I have known him to be, or whether he is harboring beliefs he has never shared with me.  I mean, even the possibility of it being true is terrifying and I have cried quite a lot over it.  I really don't think he is racist at all, but that is a huge word to be throwing around even just in your sleep. \n\nShould I confront him about it?

He said he is \u201cnot obligated\u201d to talk to me and now we are both upset. I\u2019m unsure what to do. \n\nMy boyfriend [23m] and I [23f] have been dating for four years and he currently lives with me. When he gets stressed, he has a tendency to emotionally isolate. He\u2019s been working on being more vulnerable for around two years. \n\nRecently, a few days went by where he didn\u2019t initiate any contact. We had conversations and hugged different times, but I initiated each time. One night, I communicated this to him and said it made me feel sad and disconnected. I barely got my explanation out before he got defensive, noting that he has a lot going on with work and he can\u2019t do anything else until everything professionally is resolved. I explained that I understand and don\u2019t want too much, just for him to initiate a few conversations and physical contact. He declined to share what exactly was going on at work, so it was hard to gauge where exactly he was coming from. \n\nWe went back and forth a few times before he said \u201cI\u2019m not obligated to have a conversation with you if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d That took me back immediately. Although he\u2019s right, I can\u2019t wrap my head around describing a conversation with your significant other as an obligation, let alone refusing to even participate in what I feel is a normal and essential aspect of any relationship (romantic or other). \n\nThe conversation ended pretty heated, and I went to room and locked the door to have time alone. I was laying on my bed when I heard the doorknob jiggling, followed by him walking in. I guess he had heard me lock the door and had unlocked the door with a screwdriver. I said \u201cCan you please knock before coming in? I locked the door to be alone.\u201d He ignored me, grabbed something of his that was in the room, and walked out. It was clear he was really upset. The next morning, I asked if we could continue the conversation and he declined. It still hasnt been resolved since and his behavior towards me hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nI might be in the wrong for asking him to be more emotionally available than he had the capacity to be. He might be in the wrong for not investing more time in being vulnerable or emotionally available, as well as dismissing my feelings when I communicate them. I can\u2019t decide and would love an outside opinion. \n\nMore info:\n1. My boyfriend and I both take space from each other after arguments when needed to calm down and re-center (hence, me going to the room for space). I think that\u2019s different than a consistent posture of not engaging with the other person.\n\n2. We have been having conversations about him not shutting me out completely when he\u2019s stressed for around two years now. Although he verbally agreed to trying, little progress has actually been made. He\u2019s never before said he is \u201cnot obligated\u201d to speak with me until now. \n\n3. My boyfriend is stressed more often than not. If I didn\u2019t initiate contact, we probably wouldn\u2019t interact at all during the week and only on some weekends. It\u2019s not just this one situation, but more of a chronic issue. \n\n4. My boyfriend lives with me and doesn\u2019t pay rent. I\u2019m happy with our situation and it doesn\u2019t bother me.\n\nI get that everyone deals with things in their own way, and I don\u2019t expect to even participate in that process (although I would like to). I really just don\u2019t want our relationship to be affected all the time. If he shuts down completely every time he\u2019s stressed, we really would only interact on the weekends and sometimes not even then.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676780363.0},{"title":"How do I (22M) make women feel safe (or at least safer) when I am around?","author":"Phlegmsicle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/115wpds\/how_do_i_22m_make_women_feel_safe_or_at_least\/","text":"I recently read a quote that says the following: \"Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.\"\n\nNeedless to say this seems true based on everything I've heard from women. And as a man, the former seems to be true, at least for me.\n\nUnfortunately, when I read this, I understand that there is nothing I can do that can stop women from fearing me.

I worked really hard to get out and to get my life on track and now I\u2019m in grad school. I am also in therapy to heal over the trauma of stuff when I was younger.\n\nLast semester, unexpectedly, I became friends with one of the seniors in my program. He (29M) actually sought me out to become friends with and we connected over shared interests.\n\nHe made me feel really seen and we had a lot of things in common. I began to have some feelings for him, which I tried my best to hide, but I think he suspects that I have a crush on him at least, though we didn\u2019t talk about it.\n\nI value him as a friend. I don\u2019t actually want to date him despite my feelings because I know that we would be incompatible because I need a level of care and attention that he would be unable to provide as he has had a very stable normal life thus far and people like that can\u2019t even understand broken people like me.\n\nSo we have never broached the topic and I never would either.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think he is attracted to me at all - because I\u2019m quite plain looking and he\u2019s not. I also think he likes another girl in his cohort but she\u2019s seeing someone else so I sometimes think that he\u2019s just kind of waiting for that to blow over to ask her out.\n\nDespite all this, though it was a bit painful, I cherished the conversations we had - mostly over text because our program is in hybrid format since Covid. We used to text  at least once a week, if not more. We used to send each other one  reading every week because we\u2019d formed a sort of informal reading club between the two of us.   \nWe are both interested in a very specific niche area in our field and most of our conversations are just around that - so I think that he might see me more as a colleague than as a friend even though he sometimes shares some personal stories with me.   \n\nI sent him something ten days back after he had initiated a conversation about something else and he didn\u2019t respond to me or acknowledge it.\n\nHe just didn\u2019t say anything and hasn\u2019t said anything back since. We were having a normal conversation and I sent him this reading - it was a recent research paper on our shared area of interest, so nothing offensive or anything - and he just stopped responding mid-conversation.

But we are not the perfect match. We have had wonderful moments, but this relationship has been always hard. I know all relationships are hard, but i feel this is often another level of hard. However, i do not have anything to compare, as I have been with him all my adult life, since I was 16. I cannot imagine a life without him anymore, but i cannot imagine a completely happy life with him either. \n\nLong story short, we felt in love in highschool and have grow together since. His personality though is very different to mine, and has always been. He is more a loner, wanting to be at home and have an easy life, while i am hard-working, ambitious, social and adventurous. He stoped studying after highschool. I am currently pursuing a PhD. \n\nI had to leave my city to study the PhD, so we have been in a long distance relationship for 3 years now. During this period i have lost my mom and had to live all the mourning alone. I just feel disconnected to him and i have started to realize that i have let passed so many red flags during our relationship that i just wouldn't pass now to anyone else. \n\nI am realizing that because all these doubts i am not longer really a good partner to him either. I honestly been in surviving mode for so long that i have been thinking only in me during the process. I of course feel guilty about it. \n\nMy friends and family, including my mom, never thought he would be a good partner to me. Like they have been seeing bad signals along the way.This also really affects me. Even more now that my mom is not woth me. They do not say anything by now, but i do feel that if anything goes terribly wrong, they would have been right from the beginning. \n\nHe wants me to finnish the PhD as soon as possible, as he is waiting for me to buy a house close to where he is living. I am not sure if i would find the job of my dreams there. I would probably have better options outside my country. In fact, i would love to live abroad with my partner for a while. But this is a no-go for him. \n\nHe don't really wants children in the future, but gives me signals into thinking that he would maybe be a good father to one. My parents divorce when i was a child and my father disappeared from my life. I do not want my children, if i have any, to not have a good father. \n\nI am blocked and scared. He is the most important person in my life now, but i am putting a lot of physical and emotional barriers between the two of us and I hate it. \n\nI am about to turn 30. All my friends are really happy with their partners and starting to commit. I would like this situation, but doesn't really feels right. \n\nI am about to turn 30. No stable job because of academia. Don't feeling excited about the idea of to start dating now for the first time ever really. \n\nHe listens to me. He makes me laugh. He really wants to be with me. He built his life around this relationship. This really makes me feel valued, but it also scares me. I want him to choose me because of me, not because of fear of not having me or the fear of no finding anyone else. He tries to be supportive, but it sometimes does not really feel genuine. Ex. He gives me support to pursue my PhD as long as it means going back to where he wants to buy the house. HJee never really shared why this is important for me. He would not support me if I had to leave my country to keep my carreer going. \n\nIt's weird and it may sound obvious, but i always thought that if things started to go wrong we would just notice and finish the relationship. Now i realize that we chose to be with our partners everyday, even when things are not perfect. I have never been so clear on knowing that i am choosing this life with him now. Am I choosing correctly? It doesn't even feels like i have the option of choosing anything else by now of i just decided to break up. I do not really feel capable of break up either.\n\nI am anxious all the time. Anxious of leaving. Anxious of staying. Guilty of doubting. Guilty of not valuing him more. Is it something wrong with me? Am I the one being immature here? \n\nSorry for the long post and all the ranting.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1676710042.0},{"title":"How do I (23m) say \u201cIf you aren\u2019t comfortable then we don\u2019t have to have sex at your place\u201d in a smart way given the situation?","author":"Dr_Garp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/114wycv\/how_do_i_23m_say_if_you_arent_comfortable_then_we\/","text":"So I (23m) stayed over my GF\u2019s (20f) place the other night and we have a no sex at her place rule, given the fact she has a housemate and doesn\u2019t want him to hear us.

I have such deep friendships back home, and I'm not interested in being friends just for the sake of being friends. I truly want to make deep connections in this new city, but I'm finding myself a little too comfortable .. and lazy? being alone.\n\nMy last relationship took a toll on me. After 2-3 years of healing, and this time of my life i really want to find someone. I've tried here and there in the past, but I find that it's super quick for me to know off the bat, if I like someone or not. It doesn't take too long and its because, I need a particular spark that I feel that's beyond some sort of physical standard or personality type. It's just a feeling that start's with a strong curiosity about the person. Usually, I can tell within the first 30min on a first date whether the spark is there or not. I have tried going on 2nd dates with people, because my friends think that attraction takes time and you never know. But even on those dates, (as open-minded and wiling as I try to be), I just don't feel that feeling so it's pretty and black and white for me.\n\nI'm truly not trying to be - I've just always trusted my intuition about these things. But lately, i'm worried that I'm sabotaging myself and\/or being judgmental. f other's can relate or can give their opinion on my I'm so cut throat about this. I truly want to fall in love again, and I'd like to believe that I really went through the tunnel of healing and spent enough time alone. But I know that I still approach any new potential romance in this black and white way and i need to understand if this is okay, or if i need to change my ways (without lowering any standards just for the sake of being with someone of course).\n\nI'm trying not to let the fact that I'm turning 30 bother me like the cliche that it is, but the loneliness is hitting differently lately, so some female advice would be wonderful.

L was the one who encouraged me to get out of that relationship for my own good, and I will always be grateful for the way he supported me during one of the worst times of my life. \n\nme and L have a happy relationship. we get along really well, and he really gets me. we are doing long distance because i go to uni in another city, but i visit him every weekend. \n\nwhile i m away at uni i live in a dorm, and i made a lot of friends there. among them, in the same group of friends, is one guy, let s call him R(22M). R is from the same city that I am, I have known him since I was little because we had a lot of common friends but we were never introduced to each other up until january because he lives in the room right next to mine.\n\n\nI always had a crush on R growing up, but it was never anything serious. He is really, really handsome and that was about it, I never thought of him other than a really pretty guy. But there was always a crush there, which dissappeared everytime I got into a new relationship. \n\nNow, since we live door to door, we started seeing each other accidentally almost daily, so we started saying hi to each other, and one day he invited me over to have a smoke. and since then, that happens almost daily, each evening we meet up to smoke a cigarette and we end up talking for 10 minutes, or three hours, depending on our schedules. \n\nthe thing is, i find myself enjoying talking with him so much. now, to me, not only is he one of the prettiest guys i know, so there is obviously a physical attraction there that i cannot deny, but he is also very smart and funny and i enjou talking with him. and he makes me so nervous, i hate it. i hate that i allowed myself to give in to this crush, and i dont even know why i am doing it. i feel so guilty, nothing happened between us, no flirting, absolutely nothing. just talking about life in general, movies, books, and joking around. but that s all. \n\nnow we are home because we are in our intersemestral break. today i was out having coffee with my boyfriend and our friends, and R texted me asking if i am at that coffee shop( it s the only one we have in town), because he wanted to meet up to chat and hang out. that s when i left to go home. \n\n\ni dont even know why i did that. i just didnt like the thought of being in the same room with my bf and him. but that s really not fair to my boyfriend, and i dont know what to do. our relationship is not perfect, but he is really caring and for the first time in my life i feel loved. and i love him too. and i could never, ever hurt him. i respect and admire him too much. but this crush is really messing with my head. \n\n\nsometimes i feel like the version of myself that my bf fell in love with, the one with 0 self confidence, is long gone, and the my current self is not what he wants. i feel like sometimes my bf is bothered by the fact that i post pictures of myself, that i spend more time studying than with him, that i finally have a group of friends with whom i get along at uni. he told me that he feels left out because of all these things, but i always, always make time for him, i am the only one who visits, he got mad bevause i couldnt visit him during my exams, and i just feel like this new version of myself, me prioritizing myself for the first time in my life doesnt sit well with him. \n\n\ni love him, but i am not sure if he loves the current me anymore, even though he says he does, his actions say otherwise. is it possible that we are just not compatible anymore? could that be an explanation of my sudden crush? i never had such intense feelings for someone else in any of my other relationships. should i just cut all contact with R and focus on my relationship? or should i allow myself to feel the way i feel? i am really confused, any advice is more than welcomed.\n\n\nTLDR: me(20F) and my bf(25M) have been in a relationship for 3 months, but best friends for a year, and I feel like I have changed a lot since we started to fall in love with each other half a year ago. now, i have a crush on someone else, and I am really confused as to what i should do regarding my feelings.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1676587900.0},{"title":"How do I (23m) ask a girl (23f) out for drinks & make sure she knows it's not a date?","author":"Jobdriaan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/113r1fq\/how_do_i_23m_ask_a_girl_23f_out_for_drinks_make\/","text":"I have a girl in my class.

I decided that I would take her to a special date for valentines. I wanted to make it super special, so I went to her house and asked her to be my valentines. I bought her flowers and a gift the next day and took her on a nice date, she was pretty cold because I imagine she was not ready to be open with me yet. I stayed patient and decided to ask her questions and she started being open and smiley and loving again. We were joking around during the date, when the date came to an end. She gave me her bag to carry for her, I thought she was joking with me because she gave me a look that she usually does when she's pulling my leg, so I decided to play along by looking at her and smiling then saying \"agh please\" then I walked away.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related but something I just noticed.\n\nAnyway she is with a man that I have seen emotionally abuse her in front of friends. I actually convinced her to leave him and move next door to me for a couple of months last summer. She was still seeing him and she ended up getting pregnant. I had to learn she was moving back in with him through our landlord that thought we would know since we\u2019re friends\u2026 \n\nSince then we have only gotten together once in December to just catch up and do Christmas things together. I had to set it up and she hadn\u2019t tried to set anything else up again. \n\nThis is her first pregnancy and while I wish more than anything but wasn\u2019t with him, I still wanted to be a part of their life. She is like a sister to me but we have never had strong communication so I\u2019m not sure how to bring these things up. \n\nShe texted me in January, 1 week after giving birth, and her text was extremely formal. It felt bizarre getting a text so formally about how she had given premature birth and how he was in the nicu but everything was fine. I was upset she hadn\u2019t reached out for support and it made me so sad because most of her family lives even further away and she doesn\u2019t have a lot of support where she lives now. I\u2019m her closest friend, I know for a fact she doesn\u2019t confide in other people beside her mom. I, of course, didn\u2019t bring up my own feelings because I can\u2019t begin to imagine everything she\u2019s been going through. And if she wasn\u2019t ready to tell me about it I didn\u2019t want to press her. I offered to help with meal prepping, going to classes with her, helping with cleaning, etc. she said she appreciated it and would let me know when the baby can go home and let me know when they\u2019re comfortable letting others meet him.\n\nI\u2019ve had to text her several times since then to ask about updates but she doesn\u2019t reach out first. Last time I texted her she said her and her partner closed on a house. I didn\u2019t even know she had decided to move forward with that. I\u2019m waiting for the next text to let me know she got married weeks ago\u2026 \n\nWhen we talked in December the way she talked about her pregnancy situation was presented in a way that said \u201cthis is the next logical step and with the circumstances it just makes sense, for tax purposes and the baby to be married.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m heartbroken because I feel my best friend is making huge mistakes. I want her to fall in love and experience what I have with my husband. Selfless safe deep love. Someone who treats her like a queen and would do anything for her and give her the world. She is a special, kind and thoughtful person. I feel sad there is this distance between us but I\u2019m scared to say the wrong thing and have her cut me out of her life.

She and I have a no bull shit relationship and have always been open and honest with each other.\n\nLately, I have been struggling with the way she has approached dating.  She, by admission, is a people pleaser.  And that extends into her dating life.  She also admits that she gets instant gratification and feel validated when an attractive man is into her.  She ends up sleeping with them pretty much immediately and then several, if not most, ghost her by the next week.  They never meet up with her again, unmatch her on dating apps, or just quite literally fall off the face of the earth. This has happened with over 20 men.  She is then crushed and it is so disheartening to see.  She has an over abundance of love to give but is wasting it on people who don\u2019t deserve her time or attention.  I see her struggle with her mental health (depression mainly) for many weeks after.  Not to mention one of them gave her an STI.\n\nShe was seeing a new guy (they went on exactly one date) and she invited him over to have dinner and watch a movie.

It is so hard to watch her in this self destructive pattern but it is also not my life.  How can I be the best friend to her right now?  It hurts to see her hurt, but she is doing this to herself.  Is it stepping over a boundary if I bring this up?  She is self destructive and reckless to the point where I feel I need to give our friendship a break, but that seems wildly unfair.\n\nAny advice is appreciated \ud83d\udc9c","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1676511702.0},{"title":"How do I (F, 27) make a good first impression with my bf\u2019s (M, 30) family?","author":"EfficientFrame","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/113d3c3\/how_do_i_f_27_make_a_good_first_impression_with\/","text":"My boyfriend, B, asked me to be his plus one to his cousin\u2019s and his sister\u2019s weddings.

I asked an advice subreddit about this a while ago, and I was told that he's just trying to be friends. But something happened this valentine's day, and now I'm not so sure.\n\nSo I have a coworker who's 40 years old. When I started at my job about 3 months ago, he was friendly, just like most everyone else. He asked me to go to a movie. In hindsight, I should've said no, but I don't have any friends and am very lonely. I didn't think he was treating me any different from my other coworkers and assumed he asked them out to movies as well. Although I haven't heard him invite anyone else. So I said yes. Nothing happened, but at the end of the night we were standing in the parking lot talking. He said \"Are we supposed to hug now?\" I said no and went home. I've been avoiding going to the movies with him since.\n\nA couple weeks after that, he said something that really creeped me out. I work at a fast food place and we can get food for our breaks. He ordered his food and went to stand out in the lobby. I was up front all alone, so I was bagging food, getting drinks, and giving it to the customers out the window. His food was ready, but he was still standing out in the lobby, on the other side of the counter. He asked me to get it for him, and I told him to get it himself. He refused. So I bagged it, handed it to him, and sarcastically said \"Here you go, your majesty\". He said \"Good wife\". Ick. I just don't understand why he would say that? I didn't say anything about it, but I did try to distance myself a little from him after that. There's lots of little things that he says too, that don't sit quite right with me.\n\nThis is where my previous post ended. Like I said, I was told that he's just trying to be friends. So I tried not to let if bother me too much.\n\nBut today I was taking customer's orders and paying them out when he approached me with a bouquet of flowers and a pokemon plush. I didn't know what to say and felt really uncomfortable, so I just told him thanks, but that he shouldn't have. He said not to worry about it, that he did it so he could see the look of surprise on my face. Nobody at work seemed to think it was weird, and I didn't want to cause a scene or even know how to say that I'm not interested in him that way, so I didn't speak up. I later overheard him telling a coworker that the bouquet cost forty dollars. Honestly, the roses already seem to be too much, but forty dollars?? I don't think he wants to just be friends anymore, especially since he didn't get anything for anybody else.\n\nI just feel so uncomfortable and lost. Is he trying to hit on me? And if so, what do I do? I know I should probably confront him and tell him that I'm not interested, but I have social anxiety and just thinking about doing that makes me feel super anxious. But I feel if he really was making advances, somebody at work would've mentioned something about how creepy and odd it is. Again, I'm 19 and he's 40. But nobody's said anything about it. Each time he does something, I look back and think how it would've been a perfect opportunity to say something to him, but in the moment I just freeze.\n\nSorry about the long post, but any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your responses, they've been very helpful. I wanted to respond, but have been kind of freaking out. My anxiety's through the roof and I'm always nauseous. But your replies have helped tremendously. I think I'll make another post as the situation is still ongoing, but I want to let you all know how much I appreciate you.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676409599.0},{"title":"how do i speak to my boyfriend about effort and not feeling loved in our relationship? f21 m25","author":"unfairpizzaaa021","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askwomenadvice\/comments\/112wlw4\/how_do_i_speak_to_my_boyfriend_about_effort_and\/","text":"how do i (f21) have a conversation with my boyfriend (m25) about effort, and not feeling special\/important\/loved? \n\nhe didn't get me anything for valentines day, which was really hurtful, as i was trying to hint to him for weeks that i would've loved some flowers. we kept walking past them in the supermarket, and i would point them out, but no luck. not even a card. i cooked him a three course meal of his fav foods, and bought some sexy lingerie to wear for him. \n\nalso, last night, he was hinting about having sex, but i had a headache and was feeling really down and unimportant to him. he got a bit moody at my response, and said 'is that not what Valentine's Day is for?'

It's been about 3 months since we've confessed we're very attracted to one another and we feel emotionally connected. Since then we've started to regularly spend online time together doing stuff like playing cards, chatting, and now he also wants to watch a series with me. We also had phone sex and it was amazing every time.\n\nWe always have deep conversations and seem to be really compatible and over the year we've become really close and we share many things. I feel very comfortable with him, but since we've started to be more than friends I've become quite anxious and reluctant to share as I did before.\n\nNow the problem is we're gonna see each other soon (March) and spend several days together. He's very excited and is planning dates for us, stuff to do together. We're also gonna have sex and are both looking forward to it.\n\nSince we live in different countries, we've discussed about the possibility of dating each other and realized none of us wants a distance relationship but decided we'll go with the flow and see where things go. \n\nNow I really want to have sex with him.

But many people have told me that if I have sex with him when we see each other this would ruin the prospects for anything more in the future. \n\nAnd I am so confused by this. Because I really want to have sex with him. Why do I have to withhold it or force myself to deny it or play some games? I know that in my case, having sex with him won't deter me from considering a romantic relationship. I know he's a man and men are different but at the same time this doesn't sit well with me and makes me incredibly anxious.\n\nCan't I just do what I feel without fearing that it'll ruin everything?\n\nBtw he's on the autism spectrum and we also both have ADHD.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1676395869.0},{"title":"My mental illness burdens my parents.

However, I truly believe my sister when she says they had a really special, joyful an sweet love for each other. \n\nI first thought his hesitance was bc of the pressure he gets from his batshit crazy mom who probably is a narcissist and doesn\u2019t want him to be with someone like my sister.

He even met my parents, progress!\n\nHowever, that soon came to an end and threw us all for a loop when after a fight him and my sister had about my sisters past sexual history (like it matters) he went quiet and ended up bringing home a girl for the holidays, a girl he\u2019d been entertaining on the side as an option better suited for him for him and his families multiple superficial reasons.

I met my friend at work about 2 years ago (this was in retail). We hung out a couple times in public in late 2021 and then we started hanging out at his house to watch movies come May of 2022. I know what kind of movies he watches, and a lot of them have themes of sexual violence. I told him I can\u2019t watch anything like that. For some reason, he didn\u2019t seem to clue in as to why I couldn\u2019t watch them and would keep recommending we watch them, so I eventually told him I do have PTSD from being in an abusive relationship, where I was repeatedly r*ped and abused sexually in other ways. Also, during these hangouts, he\u2019d keep trying to touch my thighs and arms and stuff like that and I\u2019d repeatedly tell him to stop. I think after several hangouts, he eventually did. \n\nDuring one of these hangouts, he did admit that he has feelings for me and though I\u2019m not out to many people, I did disclose to him that I am actually a lesbian and I made it very clear there\u2019s no chance of us being together. \n\nCome August of 2022 (around the same time he left my work) one of his friends died of a drug overdose so I went there to support him. He started cuddling with me because I guess he finds physical affection to be the best way to comfort him, and I allowed it because his friend just died, and I wanted to support him. From there, cuddling kind of became a regular thing. At first, I was uncomfortable with it and he knew that, but eventually I didn\u2019t mind it. He had also said that he\u2019d cuddled platonically with other woman before. However, over the past few months, I\u2019ve become increasingly uncomfortable with it for many reasons, but I feel like after allowing this to go on for 6 months, I can\u2019t just be like out of nowhere \u201cyou know what, I don\u2019t want you to touch me at all anymore\u201d. I know it\u2019s my fault for allowing it to go on but I really don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIn terms of the ways he\u2019s made me uncomfortable throughout this time, he\u2019s seemed to become obsessed with me and just inappropriate. He\u2019ll text me every day and want to text all day, and he\u2019ll want to see me almost everyday unless he\u2019s busy with video games. It also feels like he makes his emotions my responsibility and will tell me how he\u2019s depressed so he needs my cuddles. He even tries to get me to sleepover (which I\u2019ve never done), because he\u2019s said how it apparently cures his depression when I\u2019m around and cuddling him. On the same token, when I\u2019ve tried to go to him for emotional support as a friend (which really isn\u2019t very often), he\u2019s just cold and doesn\u2019t seem to care. He also always makes it known he\u2019s into me and will say that we\u2019re dating or married to me (he says it\u2019s just to annoy me). He will act like we\u2019re in a relationship when we\u2019re not. When I get upset with him about this and tell him again I\u2019m gay, he goes on about how he knows and I don\u2019t need to remind him that we\u2019ll never be together and how it\u2019s ruined his dreams. He also insists that if I wasn\u2019t a lesbian, we\u2019d be together. Also, when I tell him something he\u2019s doing is making me uncomfortable, he always says \u201cyou don\u2019t like anything I do\u201d. \n\nIn terms of being inappropriate, he continuously makes sexual comments about me and my body, regardless of me having told him a few times now how uncomfortable it makes me and how it\u2019s triggering because of my past sexual trauma and eating disorder. He\u2019ll say things about how I make him hard. He\u2019s even said how he knows I\u2019d be tight, always comments on my boobs being perky, and how much he likes my ass. Honestly, he\u2019ll say these things probably about 10-20 times every time I see him. He\u2019s even told me he\u2019d eat me out, to which I always reply that\u2019s never going to happen and talks about other sexual acts he wants to perform on me. He\u2019s also pretended he\u2019s going to try to kiss me, and when I give a look of disgust or turn away, he says \u201cyou don\u2019t have to act so disgusted god.\u201d He also tells me how he\u2019s so offended (he has the same response when I act disgusted when he talks about performing sexual acts with me). \n\nAlso, he\u2019s often touched me in ways that are inappropriate and he knows I\u2019m uncomfortable with. He\u2019s repeatedly put his mouth on me. The odd time he\u2019s even spanked or groped me. He\u2019ll also put his face super close to mine, which he knows I don\u2019t like. When I tell him not to touch me a certain way, he\u2019ll often continue. I\u2019ve had a serious conversation with him twice now about touching me in certain ways after I said no or doing things like groping\/spanking me and he\u2019ll apologize profusely but things don\u2019t change. He\u2019s even made a joke about how \u201cI like when he touches me inappropriately\u201d which I told him off for. \n\nAnother thing is he\u2019ll say super homophobic or misogynistic things to me and then claim it\u2019s a joke. \n\nHonestly, there\u2019s tons of details about this friendship that make me super uncomfortable, but I feel like I\u2019ve already wrote enough to give a general picture. Like I said, I know the cuddling thing is my fault because I shouldn\u2019t have allowed the cuddling from the start and I should have better boundaries (I am working on it and am seeing a therapist) but I\u2019m just wondering, is it wrong for me to tell him not to touch me whatsoever after allowing him to cuddle with me for several months? Also, I know people may tell me to stop being friends with him, but in some ways he is a good friend to me and at times I enjoy spending time with him. Also, I do worry about stopping being friends with him because I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll out me to my family and people at work, because he comes in and visits me when I\u2019m working and knows a lot of my coworkers as he has previously worked there. He already says inappropriate things and things about my sexual orientation when he visits me at work when customers are around, and I always tell him to stop.

We split bills according to our incomes, have pets together, evenly split our time between our families for holidays, and basically feel like a married couple.\n\nAbout a year ago, he actually almost broke up with me because he insisted that he was feeling pressured to make a decision about us. Still, to this day, I don't know where that came from because I can honestly say I've never pressured him into marriage, a ring, kids, etc. I don't know if the amount of time we had been together caused that pressure or if it was his family or even society. \n\nWe've managed nearly another year together, and things feel like they're going well, but marriage isn't something we're talking about. We talk about things of the future, such as buying a home together, adding more pets to our family, and taking vacations. When we almost split, he mentioned that he didn't want to get married until he was financially stable, yet there was no clear definition of what he meant by that. I still don't know if it's a certain dollar value or a certain monthly passive income he wants first. He makes pretty good money at his job, so I don't think it's about saving for a ring or anything like that. \n\nI don't want to pressure him into proposing because I want it to come from him. However, I fear that the longer we live together and behave like a married couple, the less likely he will propose. I know there isn't a set time to get married, and every couple is different, but I'm just worried that he might decide it's not necessary after being together for so long. It also doesn't help that, when we went to a wedding a few months ago, he said he thinks weddings are cheesy and he doesn't really like them. It kind of felt like a kick to the gut because he also knows how important a wedding is to me.\n\nI want to add that he is aware that I want to be married, especially before we ever consider having children. I don't want to rush the engagement just to get married and start pumping out kids. I would love to enjoy some time as an engaged couple and then a married couple before welcoming children into our lives. \n\nI'd love advice on how to approach the situation. Again, I don't want to make him feel like I'm pushing for him to propose now. I just want to know a timeline to ensure that it's still something he's thinking about. For example, I'd be content just hearing that it will happen within the next two years. At least I would know what our timeline looked like.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1676306575.0},{"title":"The girl I am getting butterflies for is dating someone else. What do I do?

Today, I am asking my fellow redditors advice on something that involves a lot of emotions, something that I have learned myself to be disconnected with since a very long time.\n\nCutting to the chase, I shall begin my story.\n\nI recently travelled to Europe for my master\u2019s education, and I am going to be staying here for the next one and a half years of my life. This is the first time I have been to Europe and I absolutely love it here. But, recently, maybe due to the sub zero temperature currently and a lack of adequate sunlight, I became really very depressed. I do have mental health issue which I try my best to ameliorate. This time it went to a level where I could not get out of bed. Social interactions started feeling like a burden and I could see my life slipping by in front of me, helpless and alone. This continued for a month when I took the initiative to get out of bed and made myself exercise and food and it\u2019s been a two weeks since I have successfully started reading again and even managed to establish new friendships. Amongst this friendships is one which stands and the one which I am going to talk about here. I met a girl, let\u2019s call her X. I talked to X when I first got initiated with my course but it was mostly \u201chello; how\u2019re you?; did you do the work assigned; great; goodbye\u201d , which I was okay with. One day, I sat next to her during the class. We were both sitting at the end of the class and to be honest we weren\u2019t paying attention. Subsequently, I began conversation by talking about the class, made a couple of jokes towards the pointless projector and got her to laugh at one or two of my sub-par attempts at humour. The conversation gradually got to how many siblings each one of us has, what we aspire to do in our lives, what do we think about certain issue governing the planet and of the like. I had a wonderful time talking to her in class. Soon the class was over, we walked our separate ways. Another day dawns, we have the same class, I find her sitting alone, I go sit next to her. We begin talking about what Netflix shows we like, what comedians I like, what characters are my favourite, this girl had watched every single show that I love and she followed the works of many of favourite standup comedians, on a different tangent the conversation went towards her preferences and she mentioned the same comedian that I basically worship as being her favourite comedian. The astonishing part for me was that I hadn\u2019t told her that I liked the comedian this much. After this, I knew I was in trouble.\n\nToday, I basically went looking for her to sit next to her. I love being in her company. But, she tells me she is dating someone else.\n\nFuck.My.Life\n\nThe funniest thing was that the first thing that came to my mind was it was her company that I liked. Her as she is. This didn\u2019t change anything for me.\n\nAs you can tell I have fallen for her. I do not feel guilt for doing so as it\u2019s only natural. I believe the fact that if she is in a happy relationship, I shouldn\u2019t express my feelings towards her, considering the awkwardness that may follow. I know that there is a certain level of chemistry between the both of us, we have opened up to each other in immutable levels. I know about things that only a friend can know, I have shared things which I would never be comfortable be sharing with anyone had it been 2 years ago. \nI am wounded, i know. I know that I will work on myself all I can and slowly come back up to my usual self. \n\nBut if someone who makes you want to get up and conquer the world is right in front of you, and one knows that you can\u2019t have that in your life. What shall one do then? \n\nI haven\u2019t felt this comfortable being vulnerable with anyone else for the past year since my last breakup, which was messy and toxic in its own accord. \n\nDo I express my feelings and live with the consequences or do I be respectful of her relationship and develop a strong friendship with her? Like I stated before, I am attracted to this girl, sexual and everything. She ticks all the boxes. And I am currently blind to any red flags.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the fact that tomorrow is valentines and internally I wouldn\u2019t want to be alone when everyone else is in love. I don\u2019t know my fellow redditors, you\u2019re my only hope in getting out of this predicament.\n\nTL;DR: I fell for a girl who is dating someone else but she is absolutely gorgeous and makes me want to get the moon for her.

I\u2019m 27, and home alone because I\u2019m currently staying at my parents\u2019 house while they are in FL for a week to take care of their dog. They live in a residential neighborhood, usually very safe, but as I was walking my dog this morning, a man from down the street (about say 50 years old) said hello to me the first time I walked past his house, and then the second time I walked back by on the opposite side of the street, he crossed the street and began to talk to me. He explained that a few months ago he\u2019d seen me walking my dog and that I had said hello and smiled, and that really uplifted him because he was having a bad day. I told him I was glad to have made his day better, and then was going to keep walking, but he kept talking and introduced himself and asked if I lived around there, which, while it isn\u2019t out of the ordinary, did make me uncomfortable. I simply said that I \u201clived nearby with my parents\u201d, and left it at that, and reiterated that I just \u201clived up the street\u201d and didn\u2019t get specific when he asked which house was mine. He asked what I was studying in school and when I answered TV Production, he said that he worked at a local station and was building a home studio in his house where he wanted to conduct interviews. He said if I was ever interested in doing any anchoring for his interviews, I would be welcome to do s. By now I was quite creeped out, and I told him I would simply think about it, and excused myself and left. Went home and locked all my doors and set my alarm system.\n\nSo, I guess my question now is: do you think I\u2019m right to be concerned? I reached out to my parents immediately and they in turn gave me the cell numbers of our neighbors across the street and on either side of me (all of whom I\u2019ve known since I was young and are trustworthy individuals) and she made them aware of the situation as well. Other than using my alarm system at our house, does anyone have any advice of additional things I should do to protect myself? (Especially when I will have to be walking alone at night to take my dog out)\n\nI really appreciate any and all responses, this just really shook me up and any advice would be so appreciated!\n\nEDIT: To the very few people who are actually not giving helpful advice and criticizing me for not \u201cgiving this guy a chance\u201d and saying \u201cdon\u2019t be rude\u201d, your advice is the reason why women end up in dangerous and potentially life threatening situations, because we are conditioned that we have to be polite and nice all the time. I was nice to this man once and he made me extremely uncomfortable. I am under no conditions to have to be nice to him again and I won\u2019t be. Period.

She was rude and dismissive to another artist there who is also my friend. We were going to dinner and I tried to get them to go to a bigger,  restaurant, but they wanted to go to another restaurant that I knew was very small and intimate. I tried to tell them. It was awful. She kept knocking back drinks and getting more and more obnoxious. To the point that the table next to us asked her to quiet down. She did, for about 2 minutes. She was so loud and the whole restaurant was listening to her. Fwiw I also have a very loud natural speaking voice. I constantly modulate my voice so I don't blast people's eardrums. And if it was just her being loud, I wouldn't be pissed. But she kept insisting that a move I'm making is wrong and that her approach would be better. She just sent me a text saying how much fun she had and let's do it again soon. I'd rather stab my eyes out. Should I try to nicely tell her that she needs to work on her social etiquette?

First off I\u2019m using a throwaway because bf uses Reddit a lot. And writing on mobile so please excuse any errors. \n\nMy (26F) relationship with bf (24M) has its ups and downs. When times are easy, we greatly enjoy each other\u2019s company. We share many of the same interests, have stimulating conversation, and talk about plans for a future together. He brings out a very light and playful side of me. However we bicker too much and I think my bf often struggles with emotional regulation. \n\nFor context, we have been dating and living together for 2 years. Things have been really tense between us lately due to us both dealing with more work stress, and my bf has been struggling with constant pain that makes it hard for him to walk and do his job. He got it checked out, and the diagnosis is not something that will be easy to treat, and will likely affect him for the rest of his life, though it is not life threatening in any way. The pain is debilitating even with his medicine and of course it has completely been affecting his mood and treatment towards me.\n\nTonight he had perhaps a bit too much to drink with a friend, and afterwards opened up to me about how depressed he feels regarding the situation, and since he is so young making it extra shocking. I won\u2019t go into detail but he was expressing some S.I. and isolating himself from me by saying he didn\u2019t want to be a burden and that I would never understand how he felt. I tried to soothe his worries but his emotions were running so high that he turned on me asking what reason could I possibly have to be depressed (I\u2019m diagnosed with MDD). It hurt badly to hear that when he knows my past trauma.\n\nHe has never behaved like this before. I can Tell he is suffering so much. We fought before bed and he said he is sick of our relationship. His voice didn\u2019t even sound like him, he had a drawl to his words and extreme bitterness. Soon after, he was texting at midnight right next to me in bed to a woman that wanted to hook up with him when we first started going out. They hadn\u2019t talked for almost 2 years, but before that she had sent him messages saying how badly she wanted to perform a sec act on him. He has aways said he has never and would never do anything w her and I believed him. But tonight he wanted to \u201ccheck in\u201d with her, after 2 years of not talking. I told him how uncomfortable it made me, and he got very defensive and went to the room next door and yelled to be left alone. I could still hear his phone buzzing when he was in there.\n\nHe has always been trustworthy and has told me when any woman who he has history with messages him. I am feeling so hurt and disgusted, but also I\u2019m scared. This is a huge change from his past behavior and I wonder if he really is trying to push me away so he can dig a deeper mental hole. Is this a warning sign someone will hurt themselves? Is he just tired of the relationship w me and doesn\u2019t have the energy to pretend anymore? Any insight would be appreciated, I\u2019ll try to answer any questions in the comments.\n\nTLDR: bf has been understandably upset due to some health issues.

On that moment I felt my blood pressure going downhill and I just couldn\u2019t believe her, she told me this while sobbing again. She\u2019s been having a tough time since her dad lost her job, he\u2019s going through a divorce and her relationship with her dad is not the best atm, all of this kicked her really bad and since the beginning of this situation I told her I\u2019d be for her and support her at any moment. That friday night she gave me more context about it but this time she was more calmed, we stayed up talking until 6 am and when I noticed she was more chill we went to sleep. \n\nThen yesterday we woke up and everything was good, we had breakfast and we were doing fine, then we got out because I had some things to do and when we were heading back home I noticed her eyes were full of tears again, I didn\u2019t say anything because I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cpushy\u201d so I waited until we got home and I sat her to talk, she was telling me that her mind was a mess right now and that she didn\u2019t want to contaminate me or our relationship with her problems, that she didn\u2019t want to be an emotional charge and this is when she asked for space, she told me it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us, that I shouldn\u2019t take it as \u201casking for time\u201d or \u201cbreaking up\u201d, that she just needed to be in her room making peace with herself for some days, I told her I was ok with this but I didn\u2019t want to let her deal with this by herself, specially now that I know what she told me on friday night about suicide, she told me to please respect her decision, and she would still keep touch often (and she has been so far) with me. \n\nTbh I felt really bad, today is her birthday and nothing hurts me more than the fact that she\u2019s going through all of this instead of enjoying it, and that I am here writing this instead of being with her right now trying to support her. I can\u2019t get over the fact the she needs me far away from her right now and this is driving me crazy. I\u2019m so confused, I\u2019m in a mix of sadness and anger because I just don\u2019t get how you push away someone that you say you care a lot about when you\u2019re on the low, but I tried to understand it as much as I can but tbh I\u2019ve been feeling like shit since last night, I\u2019ve been crying constantly and I just can\u2019t concentrate on anything. I\u2019m down to give her space and I know in the deep that the reason is not \u201cdirectly\u201d because of me or our relationship but for some reason I\u2019m taking it more personal than what it might be.\n\nShe\u2019s been so sorry since last night because she noticed that I am really hurt and she even sent me a message last night saying how much she loved me and how she was doing this for us because she wants to become a better person.

I met this guy at the beginning of the summer, and we got unofficially exclusive pretty quickly. We saw each other constantly, usually 3 times a week but always at least 2. We did date things and even hung out without sex. He slept over constantly, talked about how much he loved waking up next to me. He took me out to his hometown 1.5 hours away, once just because I wanted to get out of the city. He was always so affectionate, consistent, sweet, and thoughtful. At first I thought it was love bombing, but he stayed that way the entire time, never last minute cancelled or asked to reschedule once; he always eschewed hanging out with his friends to be with me.\n\nAbout a few weeks before summer ended, he told me he was going back to school 5 hours away for a masters. I got embarrassingly upset, but he dealt with my emotions. He talked oddly, saying things like, \"If we were a couple, we would be like...\" ? I also told him I loved him at one point, which was way too soon, but even though he (understandably) didn't reciprocate, it didn't freak him out at all. He made me a painting of one of my favorite things and gave it to me as a parting gift. He told me he loved me back. But it felt empty since he didn't want to even try long distance. Didn't seem like he cared about losing me. I was so distraught from feeling like something with such meaning actually meant nothing. I felt stupid and delusional.\n\nA couple weeks into his being gone, we start to talk a good amount. He texts me unprompted, tells me he's coming back soon, tells me he misses me. We FaceTimed for 1-2 hours three times, all initiated by him. Our talking isn't even sexual. Just innocent and sweet, reminiscent. He tells me how excited he is to see me. I tell him I've been with one person since he left, and he maintains he hasn't been with anyone. He had no reason to lie. He seems genuinely uninterested in being a fuckboy, so it makes the rejection even harder. It'd be easier if this were about his just being too horny to commit to long distance.\n\nHe came this weekend and we spent almost 2 days together. We have a good time, super sweet and affectionate and lots of sex. We also spent a day doing touristy things around the city and held hands the entire time. He talked about how cute that was. He held my hands across the restaurant table. Just so needlessly sweet. He even asked to meet my friends and asked if I told them about him coming...???\n\nBut at the end of the day, he still doesn't want me. And it's devastating. I say it, he doesn't dispute it. I ask why he even bothered coming if he doesn't want to be with me; he can't answer and eventually just says, \"I wanted to see you.\" I can't be mad at him for not wanting it, but it just hurts so badly. No matter how unnecessarily intense my feelings are, he knew how I felt. I get really upset when he's about to leave because I feel so rejected and unfulfilled emotionally. How could someone who treats me like that just stop short of the real thing? What's wrong with me? I figured him going hours out of his way to visit me and spend two nights with me when he could've easily never talked to me or seen me again meant he really cared about me, but I guess not. He, unprompted, told me again he loved me, and I asked if he meant like as a person or like in love with me. He said the first one, and it was hard to hear because of course he doesn't owe me love, especially so soon, but it felt like he was saying he was just never gonna feel that way.\n\nI felt like it's best if I (even though it makes me sick to) kind of cut him off\/just let him know I'm backing off, kind of closing the door on it because I knew he wouldn't protest, and I knew that would give me the final blow I needed to stop pining. I texted him telling him that, and like I predicted, he was just like, ok, he understands, he just wants me to be happy and enjoys spending time with me but doesn't want me to feel like he's holding me back. It hurts so bad.\n\nI just felt like we had something special (he said again this weekend, \"I can't believe we met through an algorithm), but **now I feel absolutely sick knowing I could share all that with him, all my time and affection and sweetness and vulnerability, and he could still it or leave it and pretty obviously not care if he ever sees or talks to me again.** I feel like I can't breathe.\n\nI keep being rejected, no matter how many times I get told I'm hot or that they enjoy spending time with me or that they like how sweet I am. I just feel so empty. I wanted him so bad and tried to give him my heart on a platter, and he just doesn't want it, so disinterested that he's ok with just cutting it off entirely if that's what it takes to make his hard stop clear. I just can't deal with anymore rejections. I feel so horrible. It seems like he liked me, a lot even (but also not really since he doesn't care about not talking), but just doesn't think I'm good enough to date and would rather wait on something better.\n\n**TLDR**: Guy who spent all summer with me, FaceTimed me, is super romantic and affectionate with me, told me he loved me, and went out of his way to visit me during a school break doesn't actually want to be with me and doesn't really care if he ever sees or talks to me again. It all feels like a joke I was stupid to find meaning in. I feel sick and don't know how to get past someone I wanted so bad and whom I gave so much not giving a crap about me","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1665403141.0}]
