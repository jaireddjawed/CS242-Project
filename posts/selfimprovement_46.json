Over the last few months my life has started to fall apart and I have tried to keep a good attitude while finding ways to financially and emotionally get out of this hole, but recently I have noticed I complain a lot more. Any advice to stop complaining when times get tough and any ways to feel better about them?",

        "text": " There is an optimal balance for everything, you just have to find what suits you.\n\nYou can have too much money.\n\nYou can live too long.\n\nAnd yes, even though the saying is 'you can never have too many friends' - you can.\n\nPast a certain point, **the more friends you have, the more likely they‚Äôll begin to decrease in quality.**\n\nOf course there are exceptions to this, but as a general rule of thumb ‚Äî and for the majority of cases this principle will hold true. This is similar to possessing multiple talents or hobbies, the more you have, the less time you have to spend on each of them and as a result your abilities in each talent will be relatively lower compared to if you spent all your time honing one of them.\n\nAt this point you might be asking: what does this have to do with the notion of ‚Äòbalance in life‚Äô? Well, with the above we‚Äôve just shown that even an innocent notion of friends, which often is thought as something that only gets better as you get more (thus the saying you can never have too many friends) has a negative impact when past a certain threshold. Once you realise and understand this concept, you‚Äôll find that it actually applies to a huge proportion of things in our lives and well, I hope you will try to maintain balance in future endeavours you take.\n\n**Pick your enemies carefully, but choose your friends even more carefully.**",

        "text": "I have been trying to make new friends since going through a big conversion where I cut off a lot of my former toxic friends and worked to become less toxic myself, because I was somewhat of an alcoholic and womanizer, and also downright shitty person. After a lot of therapy, my plan was to start hanging out with new people in 2020 but because of covid that was delayed, and then delayed even longer once things opened up.\n\nIt seems now some people actually want to hang out, but I don't know what to do with them? I used to have an easy time asking women to go out because my only goal was to have sex, so I knew the routine to ask them to go out for a drink and flirt with them, then ask them to go home with me. I didn't care if I got rejected because I could just find more women on dating apps, and I never planned to stick around very long anyway\n\nNow I find it very hard to ask people to hang out because I don't know what to ask them to do, and I worry if it seems like I'm trying to date them. I know some of that might be a bit of homophobia, but that's also been a problem for a long time and I know I shouldn't think that way.\n\nI get much more nervous about getting to know people than just knowing them casually, so my ultimate goal is to eventually have close friends, since I don't feel like I've ever had very close friends my entire life.\n\nFor now, I can't seem to get past the point where I can easily just invite people to hang out and have things to do with them. I live in a large metro area so there should be things to do, but when I try to think of what to invite people to do, my mind gets very cloudy and I just can't picture it.\n\nBeyond that, I don't know what I'd do to follow up. I think this was my big issue with women, because it was much easier to just ghost them, and I don't want to be a flake like that anymore.\n\nI know it sounds strange but can anyone outline the steps of what you'd do when hanging out with new people?",

I used to be lazy and do the bare minimum at school because I could get the grades I wanted rather than pushing myself.\n\nThis followed me for quite a long time in my life, until June 2022. Something switched in me and I felt compelled to push myself more, strive to self improve and chase success. For a while I did not know what it was that flicked that switch. But on reflection I now identified it was when I had goals that I set. I wanted to push myself to become a team leader for the Logistics business I work for. I put myself forwards for helping in projects for the business, made it my focus to learn the ins and outs of the operation and the digital knowledge I needed to become an effective member of the team. This ultimately led to my promotion in October to team leader.\n\nThat moment of being promoting only added fuel to my mindset of being driven and motivated. I have continued over the last few months to push myself, performing to meet KPIs for the business as a team leader. On top of that Presenting in front of 50+ business professionals about the site and the benefits it provides. My manager has recognised my hard work and attitude and as soon as a first line manager position opens they want me taking it. This is still early stages for my journey but the more you put in, the more you get out. Seeing that paycheck rise is always a nice bonus, but the skills I have gained in such a small time is unmatched to sitting in a classroom learning theories. To be jumping from team leader to First Line Manager in 3 months just shows the only thing stopping you is yourself.\n\nI hope to continue to talk about my journey in the future and I hope this inspires at least one person to stop playing games or whatever else they are doing and start to take control of their own life.",

I don't WANT to be forced to dedicate most of my life to slaving away for someone else/some corporation in order to survive. If I do have ONE goal in life, it's literally just to exist for the sake of existing if I must and enjoy the company of my loved ones while I am still able to. \n\nI am working a job currently to pay my bills - it pays kind of okay for now (I definitely need more money but I'm not homeless yet so there's that), but I am not passionate about it. I have been thinking a lot about where I want my life to go and that if I am not passionate about the work I am currently doing, then I need to explore and venture onward to find something I am passionate about. But the thing is... how can I find a job that I am passionate about if I just... don't want a job period? \n\nIt upsets me the thought of my life not being my own. It upsets me that I never asked to exist and yet because I do, I lost practically all of my time to work that I literally have no desire to do at all. I want to travel. I want to camp. I want to eat good food. I want to be with my family. I want to explore myself and my mind, my likes and dislikes, my hobbies, etc. I want to actually be alive in this world that I feel like beats you down harder and harder at every turn and I just don't quite know how to move forward in my life. \n\nHow do I accept that this is the way things go and that I will literally always have to work until I am possibly able to retire though at this rate, who knows if I'll ever even be able to afford to retire. How do I find joy in life when I don't feel like my life belongs to me? I feel like I will always belong to my boss, to whatever corporation I'm working for, to the government. I want to belong to myself and no one else and it is very negatively impacting my mental health. \n\nI'm partially wondering if this is typical for my age and I'm partially wondering if I really just am in the wrong job and that it is possible for me to find a job I am passionate about despite having literally zero desire to work? \n\nI think more than anything I just feel trapped and lost. Trapped in this unrelenting, cold capitalistic cog, lost in existential dread, identity crisis, and poverty. I wonder if I am alone. Is my way of thinking entitled? To have zero desire to \"contribute to society\" per se, but simply just to exist... I dunno. Let me know your thoughts.",

        "text": "I liked science a lot as a kid, so everyone always thought I would be a doctor. Now, I'm a sophomore biochemistry major. But by the time I got to college, I decided I still wanted to study science, but definitely didn't want to be premed. I just started undergrad research with a Chemistry prof this quarter and I love it. Honestly I worry sometimes that I'm bothering her- mostly because I'm just super clumsy (I've spilled product in the glove box...), but also because I ask a bunch of stupid questions and get really excited when I see new things like liquid nitrogen boiling or reactions changing color.\n\nThe problem is that I feel like I can't keep up this quarter. Last quarter I got my first A- in college so far in organic chemistry, and this quarter, I'm staying up until at least 2-3 am every night because I have too much work, can't focus, and feel like trash all the time.\n\nI'm constantly comparing myself to my roommate, who is the sweetest person I know, and also the smartest person in our grade at our school when it comes to organic chemistry (it's a smaller college with maybe \\~5000 undergrads iirc so I know everyone in the orgo classes and know it's true). I haven't seen her get below 97-100% on a test, the profs are always saying she asks good questions, and she always gets to sleep earlier than me.\n\nYesterday my professor presented a poster about the research we were about to start (Since I'm so new to the lab I was presenting too but more about what it's like to start undergrad research in general, not the actual content of our research). My roommate was there and she could follow the reactions and understand what was going on way better than I can, just from seeing our poster and having the professor's explanation. I feel so inadequate next to her. This isn't a new issue for me- I've always felt like I can't measure up whether it's about appearance, social skills, and other things, and getting high grades was always the only thing I had that I could take pride in. I know that all it does is make me a really toxic person to be around. I just can't shake this idea that my parents ingrained in me that I have to be successful and have some career they can take pride in or I'm a failure.\n\nSometimes I fantasize about dropping out or switching majors because I am sleep deprived and constantly feeling like next to her I'm useless. She really just blossomed after joining a research lab over the summer (something I regret not doing now) and she clearly loves and is meant to do this. I don't feel that certain either way. Writing is something I know I'm passionate about, and I have a creative writing minor. In an ideal world with infinite time I would probably want to study English or Philosophy as a major, but I probably wouldn't quit biochemistry, at least not at first. Changing majors isn't an option, since my parents are paying for my education and they insist that I study STEM because otherwise \"I'm wasting their money.\" In fact my dad already accuses me of wasting his money when I say that I don't want to become a doctor and instead want to be \"a lab rat.\"\n\nI feel like if I could only have a little bit of confidence in myself, then I would be able to keep on learning and growing instead of feeling like trash every time a friend gets an A and I get an A-. I would be able to figure out whether I actually want this path or whether I need to start pursuing something else. I wouldn't hate myself and procrastinate when I have too much work to get done. I just don't know what steps I can take to feel better about myself and relax. And I have an orgo midterm tomorrow and the mechanisms are not sticking in my mind.\n\nI guess all I can do is keep studying?",

I don't know what I want to study in school and I have no idea as to what I want to do as a career. I don't work at the moment because I haven't been able to find the motivation to look for a job, and I'm debating whether I'd like to work a part-time job, start an etsy, fiverr or some type of online business or a combination of the 2. Due to the fact that I am stuck in a position where I don't know what to do, I don't think I'd be a good candidate for a relationship right now because I don't have myself together at the moment. I'd like to become more independent and work on myself to be more attractive before I start dating by going to the gym, eating healthy and adjusting my self-care routine. I'd like to pick up some hobbies and socialize more as well. The only thing now is that I can't find the motivation to do anything because I don't know what to do and it's a tough position to be in. I'd like to get myself back but I'm unsure as to where to go from this point. I was wondering if I could get some advice on what I can do to improve myself as a person? Any advice is appreciated.\n\n\nThanks!",

But instead of giving up, John took a step back and reassessed his goals and strategies. He knew he couldn't do it alone, so he reached out to friends, family, and fellow entrepreneurs for support. He also started reading books and attending conferences to learn from successful business owners. Slowly but surely, John's motivation and confidence began to return.\n\nJohn took what he had learned and started rebuilding his business. He rebranded and found a new niche that he was passionate about. He also started focusing on his well-being and made sure to take care of himself both physically and mentally. John's hard work and determination paid off and his business started to take off.

It appears to be much better. \n\nMy plan is to still do the 50 minute walk in the morning but instead just lift weights. And do stretches for my lower leg every morning. \n\nSelf care involves not over doing muscles that may end up hurting. My leg is more important than those endorphins. \n\nI also wanted to incorporate a 30 minute book read every morning but I love video games too damn much for that. \n\nWhat do you all think? I don't know much about weight lifting but I wanted to ask one of the trainers for advice. And I was just going to do random stuff every morning to just see what I like and don't like",

        "text": "Remember back, a year, ten years or all the way back to your  childhood. How do your memories look like? Are they in a clear  this-happened-after-that timeline? Do the decisions, you did take to  take you where you are today, follow a path?  \n\n\nOr are your memories more of a big canvas of exciting, sad, joyful  moments? Little bubbles in time, starting and stopping as abrupt as a  dream does? Some more vivid than others, but none of them actually  following a path? Be honest to yourself.   \n\n\nIf you are only slightly like me, then you feel yourself nodding  along the second paragraph. My life following a plan? Bullshit. Yes, I  had - and still have - dreams and a vision. But this vision can't be  laid out in an Excel spreadsheet. It shouldn't.   \n\n\nThis is what most people get wrong about their life vision. They put  up a goal, a number, or an income level in their Spreadsheet. And then -  as they learned from so many gurus - work backwards from there: If I  want to have 1 million income in 10 years, after one year I should be  here, after 5 there, yada yada. Bullshit! Same as your past life didn't  follow a clear path, your future won't.  \n\n\nLet's even step one more step back: Should life be plannable in an Excel Spreadsheet? If you ask me: Hell no.¬†  \n\n\nYes, I often state to my friends that I would love to already know  what the next steps are, when I have kids, if my current boyfriend is  the \"the one\" and so on...but deep down I know: If I would know all of  that life would be super boring.   \n\n\nNow, parts of you are already screaming: You have to make a plan!  What does this one essay know? If you don't plan, you will get nowhere.   \n\n\nAnd I partly agree with you. Having a vision for life is a great  thing. Something that gets you up in the morning and also helps you to  go through hard times - and those will come. But the key word here is **vision**.  A vision is NOT planned out in a Spreadsheet, a vision has no concrete  next steps, you can't check a vision off your list. A vision is bigger  than that, more fulfilling, and it will change throughout your life.   \n\n\nA vision should be as bubbly, as vivid, as much of a dream as your memories. You should be seeing it, feeling it, tasting it. \n\nThis is actually also what the word *vision* originates from: *visio* is Latin for *seeing*. But enough of this Latin small-boy stuff.  \n\n\nPlan out your vision more like a movie. If you wanna use tech  references: Build your vision in iMovie instead of an Excel Spreadsheet.  Make your vision as visual as possible, let your mind be free and dream  away. Let go and find yourself in that little bubble that brings you  joy and that you actually want to work towards. You still can plan next  steps towards it, but make sure the vision comes first. Otherwise, you  are loosing yourself so much in concrete next steps, things to check off  your list, that you miss out on life.   \n\n\nThe goal of your vision should be creating more of those bubbly, happy, sad, exciting memories that you enjoy looking back on.",

I hope these work for you as well.\n\n1. 10 min mediation - When you wake up or go to sleep, just try to close your eyes and clear your mind with the only focus on your breathing. This will show tremendous results in the near future.\n\n2. Start a business - I know it sounds stupid to just say that but believe me it will make you busy enough to not think about fapping if you are really passionate about your idea. \n\n3. Cold showers right after waking up - This alone helps a lot with the conflict of mindset we currently have and what we want to achieve in the future. Our mind will say no to the tough tasks right in the morning but if we just do it, then we have some sense of control over other decisions of our lifestyle as well ( which is not fapping to porn and do anything else) \n\n4. Start communicating with people around you - I see posts of men who go to the gym and get distracted by girls and then relapse. Instead start approaching them and talk with them like an ordinary person even if your mind says no (Point 3). When we communicate with the opposite sex, we subconsciously build a belief that we can get girls in real life and we will never need to open any other 18+ site from that point onwards. \n\nNofap will make you attractive not in a way that we think of in the first place. We build self esteem which is the core benefit of Nofap which results in everything else related to it, be it Physical, Mental or Spiritual benefits.\n\nStay strong Kings you are better than this.",

I've been going to therapy, seeing results, feeling better about my future, wanting to go out there and connect with people and create things. I've been able to do things regularly to prepare for that future for the first time in years. Instead of the anxiety and horror that I've grown used to, there has been excitement and optimism. Very recently I finally got a job as well. It's not what I studied for, and I'm not planning on doing this forever but it's something that I'm good at and as a bonus I'm improving my people-skills. Of course, making money (even if not much) is nice too.\n\nI've realized that you can't bully yourself into changing. I gave myself the love, affection and care that everyone deserves and that was what made me want better for myself and gave me the courage to try.\n\nBut this morning, I saw a tweet about networking. It was about how some person would always be behind in life because they haven't networked in college. I only made a single close friend from college. I'm not a cold person by any means but college has been a tough time for me, and I don't know about you but when I'm feeling bad, I just want to bury myself somewhere and disappear completely. So yeah, haven't made many connections during those 4 years because I was busy figuring out why I was feeling so horrible. Now, after seeing that tweet, I spent more than an hour looking up some \"Is networking really that important?\" posts on reddit and am currently feeling that old anxiety and horror about the future that I haven't felt in months now. I wanted to get out there and do things, now I'm feeling like it's too late, that I fucked up. I've been enjoying meeting new people these last few weeks and now I feel like I'll never have the kind of network that I was supposed to have built in college.\n\nSo yeah. I probably shouldn't have looked at Twitter for that long. I'm sure everything that I've read this morning has been good advice, and most of them were coming from a place of compassion. However that's not what I needed to hear at this very moment in my life. A couple months ago, I wasn't even able to think about my future without feeling some sort of pain and horror, but now I can even plan about it. That's progress. I should not let some random people's advice on the internet that were not written exclusively for me upset me this much and stop me from improving.\n\nThat's all. I'll still do what I planned to do today and by the evening, I will hopefully feel better again. Choose what you consume carefully, only pick what you need.",

I am pretty strong headed and decisive most days, except that on certain issues I'm not sure about etc they find that I listen to others' opinions more than my own.\n\nI have also realised that I easily pick up both good and bad habits from the people I spend prolonged periods with. I had this roommate who was judgemental and bossy yet very good at planning and organising things. I lived with her for 6 months. I became more street smart as a result, but I also unconsciously picked up some of the judgement and decisiveness that she carried herself with. As a result of how bossy she was towards me, I became more aware of my own bossy behaviours towards my family and so, toned it down. I realised the bad habit I'd picked up one day when I spoke meanly with my father (I hang out with family alot), and it struck me that I'd picked up a bad habit. \n\nI went travelling with a friend late last year for two weeks. She was very boastful and saw everything in monetary terms. She liked to one up me on material stuff and I remember hating our conversations. She would highlight the expensive bags she had, shoes, perfume, trips, and then show disdain on what I possessed. I live rather practically, and spend within reasonable means, and I was very resistant to changing it. But once I came back, I began to realise that I'd sometimes slip in material mentions into my conversations T.T it threw me off. \n\nHow should I not have such a light ear? I'd like to improve please and not be so porous and malleable to external influences.\n\nMy brother on the other hand is the complete opposite of me. He is less of a social butterfly and a man of routines. He absolutely does not change them up no matter what, even if people laugh at him. I admire that strength of spirit. We've talked about it before. He agreed that I had a light ear. And I said that I enjoy new experiences. And that even as I absorb the new things in life, I invariably came across some bad elements.

I know I‚Äôm relying on others to be happy but I keep hearing about learn to be happy with yourself first before getting into a relationship. I never understood what that meant‚Ä¶ \n\nI just went through a breakup a couple of hours ago and I‚Äôm realizing that I get so attached to people and when they leave it just destroys me. I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything and just simply feel depressed. The thought of getting into another relationship helps but I don‚Äôt want to cuz that‚Äôs not a fix. \n\nIt may be due to some sort of insecurities I have with myself but I honestly cannot figure out what it is. I don‚Äôt even know where to start on how to get better. What do I do? How do I be happy being alone? I don‚Äôt like being attached to people and relying on people for my happiness, I want to change that but how? \n\nI need help. Thank you!",

        "text": "This is more so for myself as a piece of reflection and reevaluation of my life. I‚Äôm currently a freshman in college who‚Äôs in my second semester studying computer science. I try to workout everyday and stay active which is something I enjoy. Im struggling to keep my diet consistent and  I tend to binge eat when I‚Äôm stressed, anxious, bored, or sad. Right now I‚Äôm gaining weight and it‚Äôs making me somewhat self conscious because I‚Äôve always been relatively lean. I‚Äôll start eating cleaner and fasting. I feel like the social circle around me is a mixture of school smart individuals who try to get good grades. I feel like I‚Äôm falling behind compared to some of these friends around me who are doing well in school. I need to start taking coding more seriously because I‚Äôm doing poorly. Personally I‚Äôm not enjoying it but I see knowing python as a great asset to have to help others in a variety of ways when it comes to tech. I‚Äôd like switch majors to do pre med in kinesiology or biochemistry and I think knowing how to code could be helpful in research. I need to start eating right, putting in more effort in school, study smarter, stay away from people who aren‚Äôt bettering themselves or me, and I need to push myself by following a routined schedule based around achieving my goals of becoming a doctor who can help those in need. I need to WAKE UP. Stop practicing bad habits that make you feel good today or tomorrow. Think about a year from now. Long term mindset&gt;",

I shoot left handed in sports but I write and throw with my right hand. My right eye is blind as a bat and my right knee is so weak and tight along with my right hip as well. My right shoulder is also fairly tight along with my neck and all of these have given me a very asymmetrical face and jaw which I am very self conscious about. I really don‚Äôt want to live the rest of my life with this as I have low self confidence and I want to try get my shit together and fix my lean. Any help would be appreciated",

        "author": "DonaTheLight21",

        "text": "Many of us really don't identify with the idea of self care and self love because we do not know what it means to have self-worth and self value. This essentially comes down to, why would I care for myself if I don't value myself? Why would I care for myself if I don't believe I'm worthy?\n\nSelf worth can be defined by the feeling that you are a good person who deserves to be treated with respect. While self-value is more about your behaviors and how you act toward what you value, including yourself.\n\nFirst and foremost, think about self value as self maintenance. And once you think about self maintenance, think about the different areas in which you would have to maintain. Mental maintenance, emotional maintenance, social maintenance, physical maintenance and so on. Think about the things that you could do, one by one, that would help maintain each of these areas for yourself. \n\nAnd although this may sound overwhelming at first, there are things that would actually fall into more than one maintenance category. For example, staying hydrated and eating nutritious food could fall into mental maintenance, emotional maintenance, and physical or nutrition maintenance.\n\nNext, think about the way that you speak about yourself to others. Although erasing the negative self-talk is a process that could take as many years to completely diminish, speaking negatively about ourselves to those around us is something that might be easier to shift. This is because we can use those around us to hold us accountable because these are things we are saying out loud and not just thinking.\n\nAsk those around you that you trust to tap you on the hand every time you say something unkind or untrue about yourself out loud and slowly watch how your language begins to shift. The less we speak about ourselves negatively, the less we will tolerate it from others.\n\nLastly, take some time to actually get to know yourself. This might be taking yourself on dates, spending time alone, or taking breaks away from social media to sit with your own thoughts. This could also be things like practicing naming your emotions when you start feeling different things, or asking yourself when you get upset or frustrated or are feeling really happy, \"what does my body need or want right now?\"\n\nThis last one is probably the most difficult to do because the more that we spend time alone sit in silence, the more that the thoughts we are trying to avoid come up for us. But the truth is that some of those uncomfortable thoughts actually hold the keys to important parts of our personality, and they are worth exploring.\n\nI really hope this helps and I've been following this advice for a little while now. I'm happy to answer any questions or clarification that anyone might need in the comments below.\n\nHappy healing",

        "text": "Yesterday, I was in my university's weightroom. It was squat and deadlift day, doesn't really matter lol. Anyway, on this particular day, the gym was PACKED!! I waited almost 30 minutes for a rack. While I was waiting and talking to some of my friends that work there, I walked past this girl and her friend working out. They were both pretty freaking cute, may I add. I almost immediately locked eyes with the slightly taller one and we both did a little \"double take\", looking at each other up and down. That definitely gave me a confidence boost lmao. For once in a while, I actually felt kinda handsome but surprised. My whole workout felt a little lighter. We had a few more moments of acknowledgment throughout that session too. However, I didn't make an approach. Simply because I believe the gym is a safe place and everyone is there for self-improvement, you get me? (Plus, I was still a locked into my workout, she was with her friend and felt a little socially unprepared)\n\nHowever, in the middle of my squat I realized something...I finally understood what \"confidence\" is. It requires a certain level of positivity! Being confident is knowing that even if they don't like you back... you'll be fine. So, you might as well try to enjoy the interaction. That's what it should all be about at that stage. For example, if I went up to her at one of those moments, were we both were in between sets, I asked for her number, and she rejected me...would I REALLY be heartbroken?? No, no I would not! So what? I still have a workout to finish and other things that I can do it improve my life that doesn't stop because someone isn't a good match for you. I DONE cowering in fear of hearing a \"No\" and if I'm going to consider myself courageous, I'm going to have to do it anyway even though I'm terrified. I'm gonna start being more open to this stuff more for now on!",

I'm doing well recovering from some hefty mental illness, but am still struggling to build a social circle. I've got two close friends, both over distance, but nobody close that I can do stuff with regularly.\n\nI know it's possible because there are people I know who've moved places and had friends there within a week. But I don't know how.\n\nI go to coffee shops regularly and have had some great conversations there, but they're not great places for relationships (platonic or otherwise). I've tried going to Bars, but anxiety stops me. I've tried Meetup a few times but no dice, and it was very discouraging.\n\nPeople tell me I'm funny. I'm also kind of intense and angry which might be the problem.\n\nShould I just find a way to force myself into bars? I've been building up the courage to try standup for like a year, would that open up social opportunities? Should I try Meetup more? All advice is appreciated.",
