But that meant that I would have to wait an extra year. \n\nFirst day of 5th grade I walked into my orchestra class, and when asked what I wanted to be I said, \"I want to be a Bass\". After I said that the room went silent. I was the only kid in the school who signed up for bass. \nMy career went on into high school, where I started to pick up with my learning. Getting a bass guitar and getting into jazz. But I Stuck with the orchestra life, for my senior recital I tackled my first concerto. The Capuzzi double bass concerto in D. \n\nThen I moved onto collage, going to the Cleveland Institute of Music. Once I graduated (only 2 years ago) I moved back home and have been with the local \"semi-professional\" orchestra for the last year and a half. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/9DIcbbb\nThat's my bass section and me\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/NuRzY6o\nThat's one of 2 basses. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/4EgsnxH\nMy playing, I apologize for the bad quality of sound and video, but my phone is on the verge of dying, and the microphone is shot.

We hope that you keep following along  in the lead up to launch by following the Commercial Crew Program at [https://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew](https://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew).\n\n***\n\nWe’re going to be the first U.S. astronauts to launch from America since 2011. We’re excited to be launching a new era in American spaceflight with NASA’s partners, Boeing and SpaceX. Those companies are developing the Starliner spacecraft, which will launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, and the Crew Dragon capsule launching atop the Falcon 9 rocket, respectively. These American-made spacecraft will be the first to launch from American soil to the International Space Station since NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011. \n\n[Proof](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-name-astronauts-assigned-to-first-boeing-spacex-flights) \n\nHere answering your questions are:\n* Bob Behnken who joined the astronaut corps in 2000 and performed six spacewalks totaling more than 37 hours.\n\n* Eric Boe was selected as an astronaut in 2000 and piloted space shuttle Endeavour for the STS-126 mission and Discovery on its final flight, STS-133.\n\n* Josh Cassada is a Navy commander and test pilot with more than 3,500 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft. He was selected as an astronaut in 2013. This will be his first spaceflight.\n\n* Chris Ferguson is a retired Navy captain, who piloted space shuttle Atlantis for STS-115, and commanded shuttle Endeavour on STS-126 and Atlantis for the final flight of the Space Shuttle Program, STS-135. He retired from NASA in 2011 and has been an integral part of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner program.\n\n* Victor Glover is a Navy commander, aviator and test pilot with almost 3,000 hours flying more than 40 different aircraft. He made 400 carrier landings and flew 24 combat missions. He was selected as part of the 2013 astronaut candidate class, and this will be his first spaceflight.\n\n* Mike Hopkins (Call sign: Hopper) is a colonel in the Air Force, where he was a flight test engineer before being selected as a NASA astronaut in 2009. He has spent 166 days on the International Space Station for Expeditions 37/38, and conducted two spacewalks.\n\n* Doug Hurley a test pilot and colonel in the Marine Corps before coming to NASA in 2000 to become an astronaut. He piloted space shuttle Endeavor for STS-127 and Atlantis for STS-135, the final space shuttle mission.\n\n* Nicole Mann is an F/A-18 test pilot with more than 2,500 flight hours in more than 25 aircraft. Mann was selected as an astronaut in 2013. This will be her first trip to space.\n\n* Suni Williams came to NASA from the Navy, where she was a test pilot and rose to the rank of captain before retiring. Since her selection as an astronaut in 1998, she has spent 322 days aboard the International Space Station for Expeditions 14/15 and Expeditions 32/33, commanded the space station and performed seven spacewalks.\n\nLearn more about NASA’s Commercial Crew Program at [https://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew](https://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew) ",

        "text": "Hi, I’m Dr. Janine Krippner and I am a volcanologist interested in explosive volcanic eruption processes, in particular, pyroclastic flows.\n \nEdit: Thank you all for joining in on the volcano fun! Our time is up, but you can catch me on Twitter: @janinekrippner. Have a lavaly day!\n\nDid you know that there are over 1400 volcanoes around the world that are young enough to ‘wake up’ any time soon? Did you know that there are around 40 volcanoes around the world producing eruptive activity today? Each one of these volcanoes has their own ‘personality’, which complicates volcano monitoring. To understand what a specific volcano might do, it is essential to understand what it has done in the past and to monitor the volcano using different tools and technology.\n \nPyroclastic flows are very hot, very fast deadly avalanches of volcanic rock and gas that race down a volcano. These are common phenomena at eruptions of all sizes and can occur with ash plumes (volcanic ash is ground rock, glass, and crystals), and lahars (dangerous volcanic mudflows) when water gets involved. These explosive volcanic eruptions threaten life around the world, and more so as populations grow to encroach on volcanoes.\n \nI love communicating volcanology science, hazards, and activity, so if you have questions about any aspect of volcanoes, ask away!\n\n*Quick note: I’ve also asked Dr. Wendy Stovall from the USGS Volcano Hazards Program to help me answer any specific questions people have about Yellowstone or Kilauea. All answers from her will be signed WS.\n\n - Videos on volcanic hazards and impacts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vfryv5R_Aixl8U6M4lAAg\n - Lists of currently and recently active volcanoes around the world: https://volcano.si.edu/faq/index.cfm?question=eruptionsbyyear\n - My Twitter account where I talk about volcanoes: https://twitter.com/janinekrippner\n - My research: http://janinekrippner.weebly.com/research.html\n\nBe sure to catch Yellowstone Live starting this Sunday, Aug. 5 at 9pm ET: https://on.natgeo.com/2Md4i3Y\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/t09otfiwwjc11.jpg\nhttps://twitter.com/NatGeo/status/1025380874781638656",
