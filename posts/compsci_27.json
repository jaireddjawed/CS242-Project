I am really worried if I will be taken seriously like woman in this field of science. I am not sure if I will be able to make successful career, but in other hand it is very promising field of research. \nAnd why I writing about it? Hah, I dont really know, but maybe any suggestion, advice or something from people, who are in this \"industry\" or maybe another women, who had same concerns? \nAnd I feel like in this computational field of (chemical / biological) science is more money than in most of experimental?

Using expiration means we're making a guess about the maximum time a node can be offline and that we're keeping the tombstones around for that long. \n\nAre there other possible solutions or areas I could look into? I'm not familiar with existing distributed system algorithms, so any good sources for general distributed system knowledge would be helpful too.",

We're going to make it special.\n\nEvery year, people (mostly from reddit, it turns out) pledge bunches of flowers to be placed at Alan Turing's statue in Manchester for his birthday. In the process we raise money for the amazing charity Special Effect, which helps people with disabilities access computer games.\n\nSince 2013 we've raised about £3900 doing this, and we'd like 2018 to be our biggest year ever. Anyone who wants to get involved is welcome. Donations are made up of £3.50 to cover the cost of the flowers and a £13 charity contribution to Special Effect for a total of £16.50.\n\nIf you'd like a bunch of flowers placed in your name you can donate (or see how much we've raised so far) at our [PayPal Pool](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/83f5W4qZXG)\n\nManchester city council have confirmed they are fine with it, and we have people in Manchester who will help handle the set up and clean up. Sound like fun? Joe\n\n(via some previous donors and r/Math(s) we are currently up to £489.50, which is amazing) \n\n(edit, 'Month' NOT 'Monday' - my bad)",

        "text": "**facts**\n\n- I have a google sheet (but excel is likely the same) with data about youtube videos\n\nThe question is asking someone like you what is best and better since you know far more than me. You understand a whole more about data than I do\n\n**the goal is to be able to tell which are the best videos**\n\nsome datapoints we have:\n\n1. **total number of views**\n2. **% that rated** - % of users that rated (forumula is **number of users that has liked or dislike the video** / **total number of views** * 100. Timing it by 100 so that the result/outcome is easier to see on the google sheet since it has less 0s\n\n1. % of likes (likes : dislike ratio).\n\nhigher numbers of likes dislikes, of views are all datapoint related to sample size\n\n- larger sample size of these datapoints is a better indication of the % like\n- then this datapoint is likely going to be a better indication of the % like (likes : dislike ratio)\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**what is the goal?**\n\n**we want to be able to find the best videos**\n\nthings we want to be able to do are:\n\n- tell the significance between 2 videos when the data is very similiar\n\nhere's an example of a practical way of how it's currently done (without having good understanding of data science):\n\n**example:** looking at the raw data \n\n1. say you have 99.5% (% like) and 100k views and 0.5x (for the % that rated)\n2. say you have 99.0%  (% like) and 100k views and 2.5x\n\nwhich is better? (most likely better?)\n\n- so i've no idea what the data/stat way of guessing which is better, but the definite practical way is that the 2nd option is better because a 0.5% difference (in the % like) is enough to 'make up' for the 2.5x / 0.5x difference (in % that rated the video)\n\n- i just know this from experience, \n\n- also this is on google sheets as mentioned above, and so there are also conditinoal formmating that color codes those numbers so it's easier to tell that 2.5x is *significalty* better than the 0.5x\n\n- because the shade of the color shows the significance \n\n\n**cont example: the probelm is when the numbers are too similiar:**\n\n1. say you have 97% (% like) and 500k views and 1x (for the % that rated)\n2. say you have 99.0%  (% like) and 10k views and 1x\n\nso i really dont know anymore, and it's not because the sample size (10k views) is too low, because this is actually a very low sample size (know this from looking at the data)\n\neven if it was 50k views, i still dont know\n\ni guess one way is you coudl say **'how much is 1% or .5% worth in views?**\n\nlike 1% = 300k views or something, but this is hard cos not all the numbers across the 'videos types' are the same\n\n**we want to be able to find some way to 'sort the best videos' somehow, prefer automatically**\n\n- if a 'margin of error' datapoint/signal could tell us that, that is helpful then, ill just color-code the 'margin of error' on g sheet so at a glance...\n- wait the margin of error needs to be somehow adjusted/factored into the 'one number'\n- because only with 'one number' can there be a godo and easy way to tell which videos are better relative to another one\n\n- to find some good way to tell what is the best videos\n- i think some call this an 'index score' or 'index number' \n\ndoes any of this help? any questions on any of these?\n\n\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**which one of these methods are most accurate for these goals mentioned?**\n\n- https://steamdb.info/blog/steamdb-rating/\n- https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/faq-for-imdb-ratings/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV#\n- http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html\n- https://redditblog.com/2009/10/15/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ptvrh/eli5_imdbs_top_250_scoring_system_aka_a_true/\n\n**and why are is that one most accurate?**\n\n**would there be any unknown/unmentioned methods that are more accurate?**\n\nYou understand a whole more about data than I do\n\nend goal is to find the best videos in all the good ways that could be possible?\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**what is the problem?**\n\nthe sample size related data is separated into two datapoints:\n\n1. **total number of views**\n2. % that rated - % of users that rated (forumula is **number of users that has liked or dislike the video** / **total number of views** * 100\n\nI need to combine some of the other datapoints into one number because it's too hard to compare many datapoints of videos that have different numbers\n\n- I was thinking about the only way I know how to go about this would be to simply multiply first the datapoint and second\n\n- This gives you a number that basically seems to mean that a video with a **higher % of likes** would lead to a higher result/outcome\n\n- Even though I'm trying to make one number, this method of multiplying seems flaws because:\n\n- if the '% of likes' is relatively higher, it would seem to 'overweight' the final result/outcome\n\n**Is there a statistical trick or way to prevent or mitigate this possible occurrence of 'overweighting'?**\n\n\n\n------\n\n**other things i did with the data**\n\n'videos types' are the topics the videos talk about, or the kinds of videos they are\n\n- so what i did was i 'clustered' (i think that's a data/stats word), so i cluttersted/sectioned/groupped the various topics (and kinds of videos)\n- so someone may say that the classfication should only be done by topics and not kinds of videos, and the two different classfication systems of videos should not be combined together (in an additive manner) into one classfication sysetem\n- but since the ratings are pretty different across some 'sets of topics', it doesnt seem liek it would matter too much (due to this high variability/variance in rating distributions)\n\n\n\n------\n\nif there's anything you dont understand, please ask\n\n**please input since it helps with progress of this problem**\n\n",

        "text": "Hi. So I've been reading Michael Sipser's intro to theoretical CS just for fun so I have no professional qualifications. But I've understood how basic automatas and the Turing machine work and the difference between recognisers and deciders and how computational problems can be reframed as the task of determining if a language is recognisable or decidable.\n\nAnd I also have a basic understanding of big\\-O notation and how given a high\\-level description of an algorithm we can determine the time complexity.\n\nBut how is time complexity defined formally using Turing machines?\n\nA computable function is a function for which there exists a Turing machine such that when the input string is written on the tape at the start, the machine will halt leaving the output on the tape.\n\nTime could be measured in terms of the number of changes in state of the Turing machine it takes from start to halt. So I can imagine each computable function would have a table as follows:\n\nExample taken is the [look\\-and\\-say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence) value of a number.\n\n|*Input*|*Output*|*Steps taken \\(random figures\\)*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|11|6|\n|23456|1213141516|104|\n|0000007|6017|91|\n|42|1412|164839274648|\n|and so on....|||\n\nSo I've designed a Turing machine that satisfies the task. I've also designed it such that it takes an unusually large number of steps for processing the input 42.\n\nHow do we determine whether the Turing machine functions in O\\(n\\) or O\\(n\\^2\\) or O\\(2\\^n\\)?\n\nIs n the length of the input or the output or some combination of both? It is possible that the machine took more steps simply because the input or output is unusually large. \\(It is possible for small inputs to have unusually large expected outputs or large inputs to expect small outputs\\) It is also possible that for different inputs of the same length the machine make take vastly different numbers of steps to reach the output \\(even if the output is small in length\\).\n\nP.S. I'm asking primarily because I want to understand the P versus NP problem.",

        "text": "I have a question on terminology to use when teaching classes that introduce parsing algorithms &amp; related theory.\n\nTerms like \"LL\" and \"LR\" seem to have originally referred to specific parsing algorithms/methods. Thus, we see usages like \"LL parsing table\". Then we started to talk about the class of grammars these algorithms could handle; thus \"LL grammar\". And then we had the class of parsing algorithms that corresponded to the grammar class; thus, \"Recursive Descent is an LL parsing algorithm\", even though it doesn't use a table at all.\n\nSo LL refers both to a specific parsing algorithm and to a class of parsing algorithms that handle the same grammars. This annoys me, but it hasn't been a huge practical difficulty, as I have never (yet) covered table-based LL parsers in my classes.\n\nBut I *do* cover table-based LR parsers. And Knuth introduced the LR parsing method, which, by the process above, led to the class of LR parsers. And now I don't know what to call Knuth's method. So far, I've gone with \"Shift-Reduce\", but lots of methods use the shift &amp; reduce idea, so I know it's a poor name for a specific method.\n\nThis problem has vexed me for several years; what do I do about it?\n\nSpecifically, is there a terminological standard I can use with students who are being introduced to these concepts that (1) gives unambiguous names to specific parsing methods, (2) gives unambiguous names to classes of parsers &amp; classes of grammars, and (3) is close enough to common usage that it will help students to understand the literature in the field?\n\nBy the way, I like to think I'm reasonably knowledgeable about parsing, but it's not my research area; I do graph algorithms. So it's quite possible that there is some obvious solution to my troubles that I've missed.",

Similarly, is this true for Prim's algorithm?\n\nEDIT: To be more precise, I want to know if given an MST for a connected, undirected, weighted graph, is it guaranteed that there is a sequence of steps using Kruskal or Prim which generates this MST. E.g. There are different choices for Kruskal when there are multiple edges with the same weight. Similarly for Prim.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you everyone for your help. I am only interested in the theoretical result of whether it is true or not and not in any algorithm to generate all the actual MSTs.\nI found the following result helpful in proving the case for Kruskal:\nhttps://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2204/do-the-minimum-spanning-trees-of-a-weighted-graph-have-the-same-number-of-edges\nI am now thinking about the case for Prim.",
