I’ve spent a lot of time of making and using flashcards - definitely useful for learning kana and my early vocabulary. I may still use them for learning a basic set of common radicals and kanji phonetic markers. \nElse, from hereon, my focus will be on reading- Japanese short stories, Japanese posts from Twitter, Mastodon etc.  I’ll probably make lists of some words, phrases, grammar data points as I read - not front/back cards.  \nI write this for one purpose only.  I hope anyone equating learning a language and rote memorization will feel free to disassociate the two.  Cards are not a natural way to learn a language. In addition- something I saw on a YouTube post and very liberating: forgetting is a part of the learning process. It’s ok to forget. \nHave fun. がんばって！",

        "text": "\n\nJust curious, I'm personally really liking it so far. Here are some of my first impressions:\n\n I like how you can choose the way you want to study kanji. There is a huge amount of customization to the SRS and it allows you to cater to what you want to do. For example, you can choose to write kanji, write it without assistance, and of course choose English words. It also had a confidence system similar to anki, ranking you on how fast you died something. It is sorta automatically determined though. If you have the GRS addon, you can instantly see sentences that go along with kanji you get incorrect. \n\nOr if you bought the kanji composition addon that tells you the origin of the kanji and makes it easy to scroll through. It also instantly integrated all my studies from what I had studied. So far it's been great. I think that kanji study by far is probably my favorite Japanese resource now. \n\nIt's really insane to think how far along the resources have come with Japanese. Bunpro and kanji study have helped me tremendously this past year and to see them get phenomenal updates really just makes me so happy. Bunpro has entered a new 2.0 version beta which refined the way you study.",

        "text": "So much nomenclature in Japanese learning textbooks point at が being the subject marker, whereas を is the direct object marker. The thing is, though, that the terms “subject” and “object” get mixed up so much, even by English speakers, and even in the classroom (by real English teachers). That is why I would like to use two simple sentences to confirm my belief that が and を really are the subject and direct object particles, and not the agent and patient markers instead.\n\nSentences: “I watched the movies” vs. “The movies were watched by me”\n\n私が映画を見ました\n\n映画が私に見られました\n\nIn the first sentence, “I,” or 私 was the subject and “movies” or 映画 was the object. Thus, the placement of が and を here were obvious, since 私 also happened to be the agent and 映画 also happened to be the patient. When it's flipped around, though, it gets muddier for me. My Japanese is not so good, but I can say that linguistically, 映画 is semantically \\*still\\* the patient, and 私 is \\*still\\* the agent. However, their grammatical roles flipped from 映画 becoming the subject, and 私 now becoming an indirect object.\n\nAre these sentences correct? I'm aware that Japanese is also pro-drop, but showing the subject with the partical が was pertinent to my examples.",

        "text": "So, for a lot of people in the southern hemisphere it's currently summer and for a lot of students such as myself it means vacations, so inspired by the YouTuber livakivi (check him out) who learned japanese for 5 hours a day for 3 months, i decided to do the same, from December 10th to march 19, i had actually started doing the 5 hours in the 16th but i did more than 5 hours and the average went up, so from the 10th I've kept a total average of 5 hours, that being said, I'll give my thoughts about this first month.\n\nThe first week went by like nothing, i was so fed up with college that the moment I got home from my last exam i started inmersing for 7/8 hours a day, but after the excitement wore off, it became harder and harder to pull it off, some day I'd only do 3/4 hours and I'd try to compensate by doing more, which led to a bit of burnout which made inmersing harder as I had to do more to keep up the average of 5 hours, at some point i considered lowering it to 4 hours because i couldn't keep up, and this lead to a bit of disappoinment as I had all the time of the world and I couldn't do 5 hours, but despite all of that, i still managed to keep the average until the 30th day\n\nDid my japanese improve? Yes! It was over 150 hours of japanese after all, my anki count of mature cards at the beginning was 5400 and after 30 days it was 8400, that's an increase of 3000 words, my vocabulary became more than 1/3 bigger, and it was undoubtedly noticable, my listening improved as well but not to a good enough level\n\nWhat did i inmerse with? I rewatched all 13 episodes of lycoris recoil in one sitting, it took me 6 hours in total, i watched chainsaman in Japanese, i played visual novels, and I watched a ton of YouTube, a ton, it was probably what made up most of my hours, mostly gameplays for games like minecraft or papers please\n\nMy weakness are definitely listening, output and reading long texts.\n\nIm working on my listening, it certainly improved but it's nowhere near good.\n\nmy out-put, while getting a lot of inmersion from YouTube helps you with outputing, i haven't done almost any out-put practice.\n\nWhile i mostly was able to not find many words i don't know, having to keep up with understanding and keeping the information in my head as the text builds up upon it is certainly mentally taxing, if i really wanted to read something i could do it but the effort it takes normally make me lose interest.\n\nMy goals for the next 30 days:\n\nread more, this month I'll try to read texts worth at least 10k characters long\n\nImprove my listening, of course.\n\nSee you guys on February 8th, which will be exactly the day that marks the first year of learning Japanese, so I'm very excited, see you around",

Can anyone recommend some methods or tools for this?\n\nObviously, any immersion with Japanese TV, podcasts etc. will target this. But I don't think I'm quite ready for that and I'm looking for resources to specifically study this in order to get to the immersion stage.",
