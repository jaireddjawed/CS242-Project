        "text": "It's probably partial OCD, but I love exploring when playing a game and ensuring I have scoured the map and found every item.  In open world games, this is easy enough to do.  In corridor shooters, or games like Until Dawn, however, it can be difficult to pull off.  I've notice Developers will often give you 2 possible directions to go in - the classic fork in the road or a T-intersection.  I'm always torn about which way to go - the main concern is that by choosing Route X, I will not be able to backtrack and explore Route Y.  Usually this is because some games will prevent you from exploring both routes - that is, once you chose the \"main route\" (which is usually unmarked (i.e. the player does not immediately know which is the route that pushes the level forward)), there is usually some artificial element in the game that prevents you from going back to the side route (e.g. a physical obstruction, invisible wall, etc.).  So you'll want to choose the side route first, but it's hard to know which is the main route vs. the side route.  It definitely causes a bit of FOMO, which I realize is purely psychological but still real.\n\nFor me, the takeaway of this post is developers should be more considerate of the user experience and do a better job distinguishing main routes versus side routes and also indicating which routes present a point of no return and at what point.  I realize from an artistic perspective, developers do not want this to be too heavy handed, as it kinda kills the vibe.  For example, neon red/green arrows would probably be obnoxious and overly obvious.  But maybe some audio cues or a discreet heads-ups that you are entering a point of no return would be helpful.  It would also be cool if the ground changed a different shade of color to reflect that you previously traversed this area.  Alternatively a map could help accomplish both of these objectives.  I've seen some games do this, but it's not adopted by most games and when it is done, it's usually half-assed.\n\nCurious how everyone deals with exploring and ensuring all territory is covered before moving onto the next area.",

        "text": "Often times I'll come across some buttons or levers or such in a game and start playing with them to see what they do. The goal of draining all the water, or turning all the lights one color, or completing a circuit, or etc etc makes itself clear and I'll solve the puzzle. That done, only then will I find out *why* I was solving the puzzle. There's a key I'll need later at the bottom of the drained pool, or I get a barrel I need to stand on in an area to the right I hadn't been yet, or there's an unlocking sound and I continue on to eventually discover a likely related open door.\n\nIt feels strange to me to stop for these puzzles before I even know what they do. Immersion-breaking, sort of? I haven't been given any indication of why I should care about the puzzle yet, I just solve it because it's a video game and obviously those levers are there for a puzzle. I did try ignoring the puzzle unless I knew what I wanted from it, but that turned out to be a complete waste of time. I'd continue past it for 10-60 seconds, see the locked door or whatever, then have to backtrack to the puzzle I already knew I'd have to solve. Not knowing why I was solving a the puzzle felt weird, but finding the locked door the puzzle opened didn't make it any better. \n\nDo you ever feel weird about solving a puzzle in a game for no clear reason other than the fact that it exists, so obviously you'll have to do it? Are there some games where it feels odd to you, and some where it feels natural? Is this an unavoidable consequence of understanding how games work, or do you think there are ways to make it feel more natural? ",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Or, in other words, is there such a thing as too much of something being bad, when it comes to entertaiment?   \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ain't one of the basic things is more = better, and this is why some of us base our buying habits on how long do a certain game lasts?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But even with that in mind, I find myself with the clear idea that some games were simply too long and those extra moments somewhat ruined the game for me. So, let's talk about it.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was absolutely in love with Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Gamecube. The towns were filled with interesting characters, the items had multiple uses and the dungeons were very fun. Even the 'cinematic narrative' had a gripe on me, I was blasting my way thru the game following the narrative and enjoying every second of it.   \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  I even remember the feeling of arriving at Kakariko Village and being totally amazed by how much the game was giving to me, there was just so many characters and place to explore and I kept that in the back of my mind as I gone foward towards my next story-destination, eager to see the plot unfolding.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And then I hit the middle of the game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While the first half felt like someone threw you a surprise party with a giant strawberry cake, the second part is you eating the same cake for the rest of the month, supper and all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Kakariko Village became a hub for a delivery fetch quest that made you go back to all the previous places you had gone. You had to explore every nook of the world map searching for \"owl statues\", and what was once a breezing experience of passing thru areas and being amazed at how much more than the main storyline you had to explore, now became ah \"oh, it was a two-fold act\".  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Doom (2016) is another example of this, in the first part of the game you're given all these new and cool weapons, you face off against this plethora of demons, learn the double jump and all the mechanics you're supposed to master. And then you get to Hell and you think \"that's it, I'm nearing the end game!\"... And no, not really. You're midway thru. Sure, you'll get the BFG later on and that's sort of a \"special gun\", but this is where my definition of a \"two-fold act\" comes from.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The first act awes you with a ton of unique content, the second act reuses this same content. From a gameplay perspective, it makes sense: You're first given the tools, now you're supposed to master it. But in all other aspects, sometimes, it just feels like you're now running in circles at the same place.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But I'm not sure I should voice this opinion out loud of \"yeah, make the game shorter if you don't have enough content to fill it\", as it may give publishers excuses for releasing way more unfinished and shorter games.  But at the same time, I won't lie: I would've loved if Mafia 3, Mad Max, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Doom (2016) and many others had a shorter campaign.   Zelda specially, the first half made me feel like I was playing the best Zelda Game ever, and with that one of the best games of all time, the second half made me so mad and miserable.\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But what about you? Is this something that affects your enjoyment of a game, or do you simply \"stop playing\" when it's not really enjoyable anymore? Any examples to share with us? \n",

        "text": "Let me start off by saying that I understand that some people would be pissed off that DICE have made a u-turn on the 'total historical accuracy' statement they made when BFV was first announced. \n\nThat said, the outrage over the fact you can play as a woman or a person of colour is so incredibly embarrassing when you consider the reasons why the game has this customisation in the first place.\n\n1. The customisation, first and foremost, is in the game in order to sell microtransactions that can affect the cosmetic side of the game. This has been a clear trend in games of late, and love it or hate it, it's here to stay. Personally, I'm completely fine with this. The only cosmetics I've ever bought have been in Rocket League, and lo and behold, my actual gameplay has never been affected. \n\n2. The microtransactions that are the root of this customisation are in the game so that the main DLC, the DLC that so often splits the playerbase, can be free. The fact that nobody seems to understand this is incredible. I guarantee that 99% of gamers would rather paid cosmetic microtransactions in a game if that meant that the game itself would receive free, significant DLC. Nobody on /r/battlefield seems to understand the rationale behind this. Nobody cares that all upcoming DLC in BFV will be free, they're just angry because *muh historical accuracy*.\n\n3. Despite what people seem to believe, not every gamer is a white teen male. If even a tiny amount of gamers feel more able to access a game because you're able to play as a person of colour or a woman, then that is a **good thing**. I am in a privileged position in that I am a white male, but I know many gamers of different genders and races who sometimes feel disenfranchised that they cannot play as their own identity in games. You've always been able to do it in RPGs, why should FPSs be any different?\n\n4. People are claiming that because of their huge need for historical accuracy, they're cancelling their preorder. Battlefield 1 wasn't particularly historically accurate, nobody seemed to care. Verdun is far more accurate than any other game and it has a tiny playerbase because that niche is just not very *fun* to play. Games that are completely historically accurate are not fun. War is not fun. Death is not fun. Games are meant to be fun, and sometimes a compromise must be made in order to keep a game feeling like a game.\n\nThe BFV beta, in my opinion, is incredibly fun. I haven't had this much fun in an FPS since I was about 14, playing Halo Reach and Black Ops 1 with my friends over Xbox Live. Obviously there are issues that will be resolved, but that is what a beta is for. I think it's immersive and represents the time period far far better than how BF1 represented its time period. One thing I have never noticed in my ~10 hours of playing the beta is that a certain soldier looks out of place. You barely even see the faces of a soldier in the game, let alone have time to think about how said soldier may be out of place. So many people are getting so angry over a part of a game that really isn't important in the slightest. ",

        "title": "Do we tend to take for granted how hard it was to develop games for retro consoles? Especially those now easy to emulate (and with games that don't take up much storage space)?",

        "text": "One of the things I notice in retro review is how writers often always state \"go for this version because its the superior one\" and \"the ___ version is pointless\" and such statement about describing that a particular platform hands down has the superior copy of the game. This is particularly true for ports from the arcade and computer where retro reviews always state that since say the SNES of Street Fighter games is closer to the arcade, one should avoid the megadrive and other console ports because they are missing frames and other minuscule elements important in the competitive gaming of the original arcade and PC versions.\n\nI am wondering though do many people- not just passionate retro reviewers but also casual gamers who are AWARE of how to use emulators- underestimate just how difficult it was for developers to make different conversions of a single game? Especially PC and arcade ports?\n\nWhat inspired me to ask this question was because as someone who grew up in the 6th generation, I remember reading articles about how it was quite difficult to port games from one console to another and even systems with similar specs (Xbox and Gamecube) would have great difficulty trying to convert the game to another platform's format. Even the Xbox games had difficulties being converted to PC and vice versa despite how magazines often joked the Xbox was a computer in a box and how Xbox was described as being similar to PC in architecture and software coding.\n\nSo whenever claims are made such as the SNES version of The Lion King being hands down the superior port because the sound is better and graphics are crispier so you should ignore the Megadrive port, I can't help but feel its an insult to the hardwork the developers had done trying to build versions for both consoles.\n\nI may not know much about older consoles development, but just because modern emulations make it easier to choose the best version does not mean that it was easy making the games (and it shouldn't mean we just shove off inferior versions)! I mean I remember witnessing the difficulty a video on Youtube of all the difficulty it took to port Ghost Recon to the various consoles and how they had to make major modification to the in-game engine, do weird tricks to fit in with the console's weaker specs that were quite below what the PCs had at the time, etc. This is in an era with easy development kits and lots of input from the publishers of how the console works and so on and even than it was immensely difficult.\n\nSo I shudder at the thought of old consoles when the architectures were far far more confusing and game dev kits weren't as user friendly, etc.\n\nDoes anyone agree? In particular I am curious about PC ports. People are always complaining the PC version (in addition to being a hassle to play), often take up considerably more space than counterparts on pre-CD rom ports so they play the SNES or Megadrive version both for convenience and to save space (or download the game faster). Is this an insult to the hardwork PC developers had to do to make the games playable on MS-Dos and early Windows?",

        "text": "I've been trying out the Battlefield V beta.  It's the most fun I've had with a shooter since Bad Company 2.  I personally feel that literally every gameplay decision DICE is making is a good one.  I *hated* BF3 and 4.  They just weren't the Battlefield I remembered, to me they felt more like a large-scale Call of Duty with some vehicles and the name Battlefield slapped on.  Point is, I'm massively exited for BFV at this point, now that I've played it.\n\n\nI remember a few years back DICE mentioned that they knew that a ton of people felt that BC2 was their best game, but they weren't quite sure why.  It feels as if with Battlefield 1 and now V (though V is more of it's own beast), DICE really did look back and ask themselves what people enjoyed about Bad Company from a gameplay perspective and tried to bring some of it back (mostly, squads being very resilient if they stick together and some level of teamplay mattering).\n\n\nDespite DICE apparently thinking that most Battlefield players felt that way, whenever I look at chat in the beta, or see headlines about the game, nearly everyone says \"I just miss Battlefield 4.  This is boring.\"  There's nothing wrong with that, but it highlighted something that I've been thinking about.\n\nFranchises aren't consistent at all.  Battlefield is vaguely consistent in that it always involves large player counts broken up into smaller squads of players built around a class system, but that's about it.  Battlefield 3 and 4 might as well be their own subspecies, just as the Bad Company games were, just like Battlefield One and V are connected, though frankly V is so different than One mechanically at this point that I'm not too sure about that one.\n\nCall of Duty is the same way.  There's the original 2, then 3 happened which was sort of it's own thing and people trashed it as a result (which sucked because it was a really fun game, just nothing like Call of Duty), then Modern Warfare came out which felt more like the first 2 but were, again, really their own thing.  Black Ops 1 had it's own feel that never really came back, then Black Ops established itself with 2 and it's crazy movement...\n\n\nAnd throughout all those transitions, and similar transitions in any big franchise (Assassin's Creed, Spyro, Paper Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Wars Battlefront, ect.) there has been drama because the game simply isn't what people expect from the franchise it claims to represent.\n\n\nSo aren't companies sort of shooting themselves in the foot by doing this?  Why use the name of a franchise when it should be clear that fans of that franchise (or it's current iteration at least) will be disappointed with what you're making?  Why not make it clear that it's a different beast by the creators of X franchise?  Wouldn't that save everyone a lot of drama and frustration?\n",

        "text": "Hi! As everyone in /r/witcher seems to be all up in arms about Ciri being 100% canonically white I thought I would present another point of view on this case that might not be necessarily in line with that.\nI am a fan of both books and the games and I also happen to be polish so i can understand the source material and the context (as can any polish person). I've tried posting to /r/witcher but I just get downvoted to hell so I thought I would try posting here.\n\nFirst of all Ciri is white in the games - this isn't really up for debate. That's why probably most people identify with Ciri being white, it's understandable. Is Ciri white in the books though? Let's see.\n\n**How Did Ciri Look like in the books?**\n\nThe books are pretty vague about her skin colour. What most (English speaking) people seem to quote is this fragment from Sword of Destiny\n\n&gt; “She had fair hair, ashen white complexion and large impetuous green eyes”\n\n Sword of Destiny page 416. \n\nMost people think \"white complexion\" is about her skin colour which is actually false but I can see how it could be interpreted like that from the context. However what the quote is talking about is just her hair \"fair hair - ashen white complexion\". Here is the same quote from the original books in polish:\n\n&gt; Miała jasne, mysiopopielate włosy i wielkie, jadowicie zielone oczy. \n\nQuote taken from: http://wiedzmin.wikia.com/wiki/Ciri/Opisy_z_ksi%C4%85%C5%BCek_i_gier\n\nFrom this quote it is very clear that Sapkowski is talking just about her hair (literally fair and mouse-like) and her green eyes. \n \nAs I said the books are pretty vague about her ethnic appearance. The best we can get is that she was descibed as pale, green eyed and having ashen hair - none of those attributes can tell us anything about her ethnic background. Being pale doesn't necessarily equal white as it only describes the lightness of the complexion (same as tan doesn't mean \"black\"). Especially in polish the word for pale (which is \"blady\") means more that person looks anemic/ill or light-shaded. As for the ashen-grey hair, it doesn't exist naturally in the real world among children. That's why it's literally a fantasy and doesn't very well translate to the real world, eh?\n\n**Ciri's parents &amp; isn't Ciri \"polish\" or \"Slavic\"?**\n\nThe books state that Ciri has elven blood on her mother's side and on her father's side she is Nilfgardian. Nilfgaard is described as Southern Kingdoms in the books (as opposed to the Northern Kingdoms who are being invaded by Nilfgaardian Empire.) If you wanted to make an allegory to Europe Nilfgaard would be Spain, France and the like and Nothern Empires would be England, Germany, Poland etc. Spanish or Mediterranean people in general have more darker complexion than people from Northern Europe. Either way this comparison isn't really relevant as again we're talking about a fantasy realm but it might be a bit useful to disprove the claim that Ciri is \"polish\" or \"northern\". I mean her full name is literally Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, that doesn't sound very slavic or polish, does it?\n\n**Sapkowski**\n\nNow what is undoubtedly polish is the Author. But that doesn't necessarily make every character in the book polish like, does it? There is a little piece of information about Sapkowski's opinion on casting BAMA people as characters in the Witcher series -\n\n&gt; She went on to say that the author of the Witcher books, Andrzej Sapkowski, told her himself that recognizing the diversity in her show would be honoring his intentions as a writer.\n\n https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-writer-tries-to-smooth-unfounded-racial-1825960625\n\n\"honoring his intentions as a writer\" - this isn't really surprising if you know the general context and message hidden in the books. Books (and games to an extend) show a world where discrimination against different races - Humans, dwarfs and Elves - is common. Sapkowski wanted to show how prejudice and discrimination can be destructive. Same goes for making a lot of strong female characters in the series - there is a lot of progressive messages hidden in the Witcher series. Ciri is also gay in the books, she even has a special tattoo reminding her of her girlfriend Misiles.\n\n**\"World of the Witcher is POLISH, therefore every person is white\"**\n\nAgain the world isn't polish. It's loosely based on medieval Europe and includes a lot of myths from all over Europe, not only Poland. For example The Wild Hunt is actually a very Germanic myth. It also includes dragons, mutants, trolls, water hags, witchers and all kinds of different beings. I mean it's literally impossible in that world for Ciri to be non white...\n\nHere is an interesting quote from an interview with Sapkowski about the boundaries in fantasy where he says:\n\n&gt; Fantasy takes place neither in the past nor in the future. What do you mean you can't use a certain item or requisite because the people \"didn't know it\" in that times? Too many people see fantasy in that way now. it's a misunderstanding of the genre.\n\nSource: https://sapkowskipl.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/rozmowa-z-andrzejem-sapkowskim/\n\nThank you for reading all of this, sorry about the wall of text. \n\n\n",

That isn't to say I don't enjoy those settings anymore, but I have yet to see a sci-fi open-world RPG that delivers the amount of detail and variability Bethesda and CD Projekt Red deliver. Don't get me wrong, I love the dialogue-intensive RPGs like Mass Effect - however, in my opinion, the level of detail and variability in Mass Effect are lacking in comparison. \n\nFrom a marketing standpoint, Bethesda and CD Projekt Red chose a perfect time to release sci-fi RPGs: at a time, in my opinion, when the high fantasy/medieval settings can't be perfected anymore and are getting a little old. A lot of people are noticeably excited for Cyberpunk, and I see no complaints, but I am also noticing a lot of people upset about the end of the Witcher series (caveat: I haven't read the books, so I don't know if that decision logically fits the story). Why? I look at it as one of those circumstances of a title we think we will miss, but when Cyberpunk comes out, we will miss the Witcher less than we think. Really random example, but, for the sake of the argument, I will use MTV as an example. I notice a lot of people say that they miss the old MTV, you know, back when it had music videos - but let's be honest, are we really gonna watch music videos on TV -no, that is why we have Youtube. The only possible way MTV can survive is if they adapt by making themselves unique. If MTV continued to place all of their emphasis on music videos, there would be nothing unique about them to keep people tuning in. That isn't to say the decision CD Projekt Red made had severe ramifications on their reputation (contrary to MTV or EA), but I think if they kept making high fantasy/medieval titles there is the potential of creating the appearance of  \"milking\" a setting for money.\n\nThe MTV analysis came from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p73U5Yfabho) video!

I recently got into FN on Switch and made a good gaming buddy there. Maybe it's because I play with more \"mature\" people who legitimately want to take the game seriously, but my experience has been that, especially with 2 or 4 good \"buddies\" the game itself is subjectively one of the most fun and intense gaming experiences I've ever had.\n\nA number of months ago I didn't really know anything about the game, but I didn't hate it either. I guess I thought it looked a little goofy, but honestly that craziness and lack of seriousness that works so well from the art style is what makes it so amazing. It feels like a digital world that knows, as a whole, that it is a digital gaming world. I didn't really get that about it until having played it for a while and it's so cool. The art direction in many ways what makes this game so fun.\n\nSo yeah, I think overall, just like Minecraft, the game itself gets a lot of unwarranted hatred and vitrol from many people I think potentially haven't actually played it or judge it not objectively, but subjectively based on a perceived \"overall userbase.\"",

        "text": "Yeah I know I may have an unpopular standpoint because I will \"attack\" an recent popular and charming game and I know gaming has come a loooong way for being where it stands now with all of its conveniences but I can't help that I'm more and more unsatisfied of exploring modern game worlds.\n\nI'm playing Dragon Quest 11 right now and one of its biggest issues to me is its minimap at the left-down corner on the screen, which is impossible to hide.\n\nWhen I'm thinking back at previous entries like dragon quest 8 (the first one with a 3D environment) there was no such map, even when it was released at a time, where minimaps where becoming standard for assisting you to navigate through game worlds.\n\nIn fact in DQ8 was a map which pops up on pressing a button, but even this map does only show your approximate location, by showing you the environment around you but not where you stand and in such a scale that no details or names of significant places are shown.\n\nThe dragon quest 11 map shows you at the start of each area the whole location and important npc's like quest givers, the next destination and every resident area where you can go next. \n\nI would be able to ignore it, if it wasn't for the minimap where you don't have the choice to deactivate it. \nIt may be a small detail for most of you but in my case it has a great effect.\n\nBecause it is located at bottom-left of the screen (which is by the way rarely seen in non-strategy games, because the focus of your eyes lay on the lower half of the screen) you can't get it out of your eyes, it's always a stain which distracts you (or at least me) from enjoying the beatiful scenery of the game. In more cramped locations I caught myself for laying my attention more on the minimap than of the actual screen, because by exploring it shows me asides from heights every little place I can get to, which results in another problem:\n\nthe world becomes more artificial because you can always see the borders of the map right from the start, knowing where your'e able to go and not to go and giving away potential surprises and secrets. \nI was really looking forward to explore these areas on my own by experiencing the borders of the game world for myself, when I look at all these great environments at first I wouldn't recognize that they are just a few inches walkable, the illusion without a minimap is just to good for that, which allows me to immerse better in the game world. The designers put a lot of effort in that regard, in early trailers it even looked like an open world game which it is not.\n\nUnfortunelately the designers didn't put much trust on the player for navigating and finding a way for their own - even on such an more linear game - and that really huffs me because Dragon Quest 11 is not the only game, but at least it was a game which was always (and still is) labled as an old-school rpg which follows old traditions... well the newest entry does a lot of compromises with quest markers, minimaps, side-quest-logs and so on.\n\nI really miss the sense of wonder and surprise which I can only get when games don't tell me to much about their world from the start. At least allow me to play the game without all these informations. I feel much more engaged when I'm more encouraged to give more attention to my surroundings, beeing able to get lost may sound harsh, but it's always a pro for the game, because most games don't even have that freedom that you can get lost. Maybe you feel a bit annoyed by searching the way back, but at least you feel something. \nIt would be much more organic and significant to place clues and distinctive marks inside of the actual game world, instead of giving you an navigator for the whole game, \n\nIn any case it's always better to reduce the UI as much as possible so that the player can concentrate on the actual game.\n\nI'm really not that much obssesed of finding everything that the game can offer me, as long it's not highlighted... like showing the exact amount of exploreable sidequests in the game right from the start. (Yakuza does this also)\nDo you know what I mean? What I don't know won't hurt me. I'm really sick of checklists and the teasing of hidden content. That's doing stuff just for the sake of completion. Let me have my own adventure, allow me to miss things, allow me to play a game a second times after years and be still suprised.\nMany old games can still accomplish that, the reason why is, because they don't share the same design paradigm than actual modern games share.\n\nAll these help should be optional extras for players who struggle to finding their way. Instead it's the other way around and players who want to get more immersed have to rely on options for disabling it, which is not always the case, like in Dragon Quest 11. And even when it is, the game is to often not designed for that, hiding away integral informations or illogical descriptions for tasks, because even the designers tend to forget that the NPC's couldn't know of things that are UI related.\n\n",

What do you guys think? Is it because most Nintendo series are decades old and are just associated with Nintendo? Maybe the people who want Nintendo games already intend on getting the console? I'm not sure and would love to hear your ideas.\n\nI really don't want this conversation to be about the console or publishers because that could incite arguments, instead I'd rather it be about the games and the players.\n\nFor reference, I only ask this because I was just having a conversation with a friend about possibly buying a Switch because Mario Odyssey and BotW looked great and I don't typically buy Nintendo consoles. I said \"I wish I could play Odyssey on [my console which isn't important] and we both laughed at the thought that nobody really ever talks about the idea of Nintendo series touching other consoles.",

Of course, development times are longer these days, but you can't deny that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare inspired the Medal of Honor reboot, and others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But, if you were to think about the (wrongly named) \"Doom Clones\" one thing that always comes to mind is: There was a clear intent in creating a totally different setting. Shadow Warrior, Duke Nukem, Blood, Redneck Rampage, Heretic (and then Hexen), Rise of the Triad. This is not to say that there wasn't some 1:1 copies, but even those had a \"mockery\" feel to it, like Gloom, who was obviously copying Doom even on the name. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So it felt like devs were careful about giving their own spin to their games, despite how inspired they were by others.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And I think we can expand that even further. We always had our \"somewhat realistic\" racing games, but we had futuristic racing games, Biker Mice From Mars, Twisted Metal and it's \"clone\" Vigilante 8, and both were different thematically. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In resume, I think there seemed to be a bigger push to diversify the settings that games took place, some were more comical, others a little more serious. When was the last time we had a fantasy First-Person-Shooter like Hexen?  Or a racing game that isn't Burnout-esque or Arcade/Realistic-ish?\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Am I sugarcoating the past? How do you guys feel like this 'lack' of diversity in settings?",

Taking historical events into account, Germany could for example have an event for Unification, where under Prussia all the states unite creating a formidable military and industrial faction. This gives them a cool unique feeling when played.\n\nHowever, I am worried that this shoehorns the faction into a historic course instead of interesting \"what ifs\" and alternative history. What if Germany didn't unify under a militaristic umbrella? But not giving factions compelling enough bonuses towards certain things risks the factions being too similar.\n\nHistorical shoehorning vs meaningless faction identities? Which di you prefer?

So take this with grain of salt.\n\nWhy are countering/parrying systems so hard to get right and which games do a good job? I think pretty much everything made by Platinum Games pretty much nails. They figured out how to do it right at some point and they've subsequently included almost the same system in variety of games (*Metal Gear Solid Rising Revengeance*, *Bayonetta*, *Wonderful 101*, *Neir: Automata*). The counter systems are pretty much identical in each of them. Counters feel same in *Bayonetta* as they do in *Neir: Automata*. I am not sure what makes them so good, but they just seem to work.\n\nA lot of games seem to have bad parrying systems. I am forever wondering what the correct timing of the buttons. They're all described in the same way \"press this button just before the attack\" but in practice it is far more complicated than that. I could never get the hang of the *Dark Souls* parry system (or anything else from that game for that matter). *Bloodborne* was a little easier, but I've still ended up in situations where I've successfully parried (enemy is stunned) but I still get hit. The *Yakuza* games feature counter moves, but the timing on them seems random and inconsistent. I recently replayed the *Shemue* games (which I think are great) and the behaviour of the dodge/counter system seems kind of random.\n\nSo what makes for good countering/parry system? In my opinion it necessarily one that easy, but one that is predictable. If I fuck up a counter, I should clearly know why that happened. In a lot of cases I am left wondering what exactly I did wrong. It's fine if it is difficult, but I should be able to see exactly why it is that I failed. If know the rules of the system I can practice and work to get better, but if it is inconsistently applied it is hopeless for me.\n\nMaybe it isn't so much that the systems are bad, it is just the \"rules\" of the system are so unclear that I can't really make use of it. In which case it isn't so much a failure of mechanical design as much it is a failure to make the mechanics clear to the player. \n\nWhat games do countering/parrying well? Maybe I am entirely wrong about everything because I am so bad video games. Maybe many video games have excellent systems and I just too stupid to figure the majority of them out.",

        "text": "I’ve recently read a few thoughtful discussion threads on the state of the VN market here in the West. Some taking a [negative stance](https://twitter.com/moogy0/status/1033339316762812416]), some with a more [positive outlook](https://twitter.com/Good_Haro/status/1033413651963801600). I thought I’d try to put some numbers on these statements and look at VN ownership on Steam, still the predominant market for PC games, and use that to analyse whether VNs are on their true route or have stumbled into a bad end. \n\nI'd recommend reading this on my [tumblr post](https://bunnyadvocate.tumblr.com/post/177773614662/the-state-of-vns-on-steam) as I can embed the graph images into the post rather than require external image links.\n\n#Data collection\n\nI checked just over a million steam profiles to try and get a random sample of gamers. With Steam’s new private-by-default profile settings, only 8% of those users had public game lists, but that still gave us 80k user profiles to work with. I could then compare my sample with the [“leaked” owner data](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/steam-data-leak-reveals-precise-player-count-for-thousands-of-games/) and scale up my numbers accordingly to represent Steam as a whole. Steam is rather haphazard with what gets tagged as a Visual Novel (RPGMaker games like A Bird Story are tagged as VNs), so I’ll only be including games that also have a VNDB entry.\n\n#Steam VN releases\n\nSo let’s start simple, with a simple plot of how many VNs are being released each month.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/jY5H3oy.png)\n\nAt first glance things seem rosy for VN fans, there have never been more VNs being released in the West. But let’s break down those results a bit:\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/nfiJTel.png)\n*Note that these trends are cumulative but NOT stacked. The EVN, JVN, and other VNs trends include only non-free VNs.*\n\nHere we can start to see the reason for the differing perspectives on the state of the VN market depending upon whether you read more JVNs or EVNs. While the rate of EVNs releases has steadily increased, the number of new JVNs has remained fairly static since 2016, despite Steam’s lowered release requirements. Steady release rates aren’t definitely bad news, but in general profitable industries want to expand, so the lack of expansion tells you something about the industry. But as someone with a plan-to-read list that grows longer by the day, I’m not complaining if the rate doesn’t increase. One under-reported development in the VN market is the recent rapid growth of Chinese VNs (listed as other here), who have quietly been doing well in their home markets, but are rarely translated. So while more VNs might be good for us fans, how does the market look for developers? Let’s have a look at VN sales.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/OGI1tqG.png)\n*Note that these trends are cumulative but NOT stacked. All sales are back-dated to the release date of the VN on Steam. Free VNs count sales as the number of users who have logged some playtime in it.*\n\nUnfortunately Steam’s API doesn’t list when someone bought a game, so we’ve got to group sales by the release date of the VN. That means there will be a bias towards older releases which have been out longer and so had more time to build up sales. Here we can see some justification for the doom and gloom perspectives, with more recent VN releases selling significantly less than older ones. With new JVNs in 2017 selling only half what they did in 2016. The EVN downward trend is especially stark given that the number of new releases has been increasing, so that’s less revenue split among even more VNs. Not all VNs are equal, some are priced higher, so let’s look at total revenue rather than total sales.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZwmzQPO.png)\n*Note that this assumes every user pays full price, so this is more the maximum possible revenue than actual revenue.*\n\nHere we can see the difference between EVN and JVN markets. While JVNs sell only half as many as EVNs, they earn almost as much revenue due to their higher price. We again see the same dip in more recent revenue though, 2017 was only 46% of 2016′s revenue, and 2018 looks even worse so far. Remember, this fall in revenue coincidences with an increase in the total number of releases, so to fully comprehend the drop on revenue, let’s look at the average sales per VN.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/ij847aG.png)\n\nFirst, we should note that this massively overestimates the average revenue generated as it assumes every user pays full price. I know devs who would sell their soul for 282k per VN. Oh wait, they already did when they signed up for Steam... (just kidding, I do like Steam, but it has issues). The important aspect here isn’t the y-axis total which is unreliable, but the consistent downwards trend. But it might not be as bleak as it seems, older VNs are more likely to have been in bundles and in Steam sales, so their revenue is likely overestimated compared with more recent releases. So I’d be hesitant to claim that revenue is necessarily dropping, but I think we can confidently claim that revenue isn’t increasing.\n\n#VN Reviews\n\nNostalgia for a past golden age is common everywhere, not least among VN fans. It’s not uncommon to hear that newly released VNs aren’t as good as older ones, but can we get any empirical data on this point? We can get close by looking at the Steam reviews of VNs over time.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/jqfXsjH.png)\n*Each dot represents the average thumbs up/down ratio for any VNs released that month.*\n\nWithin the JVN market, we can see some truth to the nostalgia viewpoint. Older releases were more consistently rated higher. But that isn’t to say there aren’t new highly rated JVNs. They still maintain enviously high scores overall. As for EVNs, while they had consistently scored lower than JVNs, they’re catching up and are now pretty comparable in review ratings of JVNs. Just for fun, let’s see how the total review count compares between VNs.\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/bmcFwG8.png)\n*The two free-VN spikes are for Emily is Away and DDLC.*\n\nAs I’m sure anyone familiar with the VN community can tell you, JVN fans are vocal, and it shows in the total reviews VNs get. Despite there being only half as many JVNs as EVNs, they still attract more reviews than EVNs do. This is perhaps because JVNs are typically far longer than EVNs, so might be worth the time of writing a review. What free-VN fans lack in the wallet, they make up for in their word-count. Although this is massively skewed by two free VNs which compromise 70% of all free-VN reviews: Emily is Away and DDLC. They seem anomalies rather than trends. As shown by the graph when we exclude those two:\n\n[Graph](https://i.imgur.com/9zkQ71m.png)\n\\**Excluding Emily is Away and DDLC.*\n\nDespite the drop in position, free-VNs still out-perform what we’d expect given their lower count of total owners, but that may be because EVN and JVN totals include users who own the VN but have never read it. Whereas the free-VN total only includes those who have logged playtime in that VN, so there’s a larger pool of possible reviewers.\n\n#Potential Issues\n\nThere are a few sources of uncertainty in the dataset. The selection of users who have set their profiles to public might not be representative of the wider Steam userbase. It probably undercounts more casual fans who are less likely to configure their Steam profile. We also don’t know when someone purchased a VN, so it’s possible VN sales are increasing, but a lot of that money is going to older releases, especially if they’re in bundles and Steam sales. In inclusion of VNs in game bundles may be distorting the image of the VN fandom, as it’ll include those who have little interest in the medium and only own a VN by happenstance. We should also remember that “Steam” is not synonymous with the VN market. There are plenty of competitors in the VN scene, namely Mangagamer and itch.io, who tend to cater to different tastes than Steam does. So we’re only getting a partial picture of the Western VN scene.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThere’s data here to support both the optimistic and pessimistic commentary. On the positive side, there have never been more VNs being released as there are now. EVNs are improving with higher average ratings and a few have reached mainstream attention. On the pessimistic side, it seems like there are ever more VNs competing for a fanbase that isn’t significantly growing. While I’d be wary of claiming profits are falling, it seems highly likely they aren’t increasing, and a stagnant market is not a healthy one. Personally, I think the future is bright. While VNs might not be destined to become blockbuster successes, there is enough of sustainable fanbase to support lots of indie developers, who are the most prone to innovate and write interesting new stories. As a VN fan, I’m excited to see what comes next~\n\n---\n\nI hope you found the article interesting. I had wanted to include a section analysing the Steam users, how many VNs do JVN fans purchase compared to EVN fans etc. But I want to spend a little longer going into more depth on it, so I’ll have a post up next week on that.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9dlnxw/where_do_you_draw_the_line_between/",
        "text": "My brother and I had an interesting discussion recently that started when we were talking about the griefing potential in the upcoming 'Fallout 76'. He is worried that players will do nothing but use exploits to gather near infinite amounts of money with the sole intention of killing other players, ignoring the other aspects of the game, and pursuing the nuclear launch codes. He compared it to GTA Online, which he plays constantly, and very well; this is ironic because in GTA *he* is the person who does this, but he knows it, and says he does it because this is what the community in the game typically does. Bethesda has obviously been trying very hard to assuage players' worries about this, by introducing a bounty system and other anti-griefing measures, but my brother remains quite skeptical and cynical about even giving the game a chance. \n\nMy counter-argument to this is there is a degree of freedom that multiplayer online games have to find a balance with, a balance between what the developers want you to be able to do and what is actually unfair. For example, my brother referenced specifically the fact that players in GTA Online take advantage of the 'Passive' mode to kill other players and not be killed themselves, which he considers to be a bald-faced **exploit**. He also mentioned the fact that players will kill themselves to protect their K/D ratio, instead of letting you kill them fair and square, not to mention all the ways you can easily rack up money via glitches or bugs. While I share his frustration, I also believe that the developers can't possibly keep players on so short a leash that the game is unplayable. Is the existence of these phenomena unfair, or are they part and parcel to the game itself? The spirit of the game, in other words? It's not a clear cut answer all the time.\n\nMy reference to him was Overwatch, a game he does not play, but one that I play every day. Overwatch is a game where cheating and rage-quitting will get you banned. It is also a game that is constantly changing, although in small ways. Many players have opinions about certain characters or aspects in the game they feel are \"totally broken\", or \"overpowered\" as well. My argument is that while Blizzard is swift to punish cheating and unsporting players, and rightly so, there is also a certain point where players must realize that the game *is what it is*, how they designed it to be; just because a certain character seems to be your personal nemesis, that doesn't necessarily mean the game is in the wrong, in fact they might be functioning exactly as intended. So, sometimes the line between what should and should not be allowed isn't so clear, and sometimes it is. I directed him to Destiny's \"Loot Cave\" as an example of a clear exploit. Players were not cheating at all, but the cave was altered because it made the game too easy.\n\nIn regards to Fallout 76, is it an exploit per se if a player were to accumulate lots of wealth and persistently chase destruction of other players? Could you not argue that the player is roleplaying just as intended, as long as they aren't literally cheating? What is stopping you from seeing it as part of the game, or maybe taking on the role of an enforcer and stopping their pursuit of the nukes? In a nuclear wasteland, wouldn't it be realistic to expect bandits, scoundrels, and murderers? You may not like the gameplay for it, and you don't have to play it, but does that mean it's \"wrong\", the fact that the game discourages it notwithstanding? It seems to me that the opinion between developers on what is unfair and what isn't differs somewhat; Rockstar is clearly okay with players being able to kill themselves, or use Passive Mode unfairly, while Bethesda allegedly wants to deter these actions.\n\n**TL;DR:** Title. Where do you draw the line between exploits/griefing and emergent gameplay or \"part of the game\"?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9d9x4x/dropping_numeric_review_scores_is_the_wrong_move/",
        "text": "So, after quietly doing it for months, [Polygon just announced that they are officially dropping numeric review scores.](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/4/17689100/polygon-reviews-no-scores) [Eurogamer was among the first to do so in 2015](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-10-eurogamer-has-dropped-review-scores) and it seems like a general trend for more ambitious games criticism. In my opinion, this is bad for game review culture.\n\nFirst, about review scores in general:\n\nI believe this is the wrong approach to \"fixing reviews\". Maybe even a cowardly one. You bypass the problem by saying it's not yours anymore. And considering the major backlash from \"angry gamers\" over lower than expected review scores, I believe it might also be giving in to outrage culture.\n\nAs with many things blamed on \"games journalism\" in general, I think the actual problem is way more specific. Yes, relevant review scores are mostly happening on a range of 7 to 10 (out of 10), which does not seem like a very good spectrum. But if that really was the whole issue, the answer would be stretching scores towards a wider range, not dropping them altogether. Also it's not uncommon, now, that only a fraction of games released actually get reviewed and unsurprisingly, those that are deemed worthy of a review were mostly promising games in the first place (which explains why there are fewer 1-4 scores than 7-10s). \n\nThe numeric range is also a bit of a non-issue, since I don't believe review scores have ever seriously represented a \"percentage of perfection\" (even where they put a \"%\" at the end). Games are generally an art, not a science (the underlying technology might be a science, but that's only a fraction of a score). Review scores aren't a mathematical function, they're just a summary of a what a game feels like to the reviewer in the context of its release window. They're just a split into 10 different categories, ranging from most to least desirable, which IMO is reasonable to judge for any game. \n\nBut that's just the numbers. My actual point is a different one that has more to do with the role of review scores in videogames than their precision: *There is no other way to make publishers care about quality.*\n\nIf you look at the movie industry, there are some sources of pride and universally accepted awards that go beyond just launch-weekend ticket sales. Even the most cynical Hollywood producer wants an Oscar in his office. Part of the appeal of movie award shows might also be that actors are beautiful people with natural stage presence, thus making a good show and tabloid headlines. There's also snubs and politics involved, but that's a sub-issue. The big role these kinds of awards is that they are an alternative measure of \"success\" to just ticket sales.\n\nIn gaming, we don't have that. We have consumer-oriented \"MTV Awards\" style entertainment shows that are various levels of embarrassing and mostly just watched for the trailers, we have some dry industry awards and niche indie awards but nothing... big. The only thing with an impact we have, as sad as it may be, is *Metacritic.* Scores are the only thing measurable in the video game industry outside copies sold and loot boxes opened. They're the only measure of success in gaming outside player count and money made. And they mostly *suck.*\n\nNow, in an ideal world, we would drop scores in favor of something better like... what? We can have in-depth, academic discussions but they don't have a real impact on and would mostly get ignored by publishers. We could have a more respected award but it seems like we try and try and [nothing good ever comes out of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMrtqKx_LIY)\n\nSo all we got is scores. And good publications dropping them from their reviews means they get *worse* not better. The real ballsy move would be starting to give 5/10s to perfectly fine AAA releases that don't really do anything interesting. And the only websites who would even dare to do that now dropped scores altogether.\n\n**TL;DR: Numeric review scores are the only measure of success not depending on sales and by taking them away, we give companies less reasons to make quality games.**",

        "text": "This is something that has been on my mind for a while and I really want to talk about it. I remember when Anthem was being shown I tried to find gameplay of it to see what system they use for special abilities. When it became clear it utilized a cooldown system in the same style as Destiny, my interest in the game greatly diminished. This has become one thing that I have noticed in a lot of games, the use of these cooldowns to limit your abilities. Worth mentioning is that I'm mainly looking at multiplayer games here.\n\nOf course the other one already mentioned is Destiny. Regardless of the other issues of the game, the one that most limited my enjoyment was that all my abilities were on a cooldown. I have to wait a while before throwing my grenade again, and then wait a while before using my melee attack. The melee was especially notable because it wasn’t a button to press but instead something that triggered automatically when a certain condition was met, meaning at times you could use it when you didn’t want to.\n\nIn fact the most fun I had with Destiny 2 more often than not was when I had a build that let me no longer worry about the cooldown. One that comes to mind is a specific one for Arcstrider that recharges your melee and grenades when you dodge while near an enemy, meaning you essentially got to use the melee as much as you wanted. Of course, D2 is mainly about shooting and gunplay (which it handled extremely well), so the abilities aren’t as much of a focus.\n\nWe then have this with MMOs. WoW heavily popularized this style of play and we see it in most MMOs today. You have an auto attack and then moves on a small quick cooldown as well as ones that are on significantly longer timers with some “ultimates” being 5+ minutes (I’m sure there are even longer ones but I am not as familiar with the game). Even fast travel is held back by cooldowns. This leaves a lot of the game more based around moving around while managing these timers to maximize how often an ability is used. \n\nThose are just a few examples. MOBAs and champion arena shooters similarly rely primarily on cooldowns, or at least the major ones do. Overwatch, League of Legends, DOTA just to name a few. Card games tend to be the exception using more of a resource mechanic that builds over time. \n\nThen there’s the flipside. The games utilizing energy systems instead, where you have to just keep an eye on one gauge and find ways to keep it full. The first one that comes to mind would be Warframe. Every frame has 4 abilities and each ability drains energy to use. As you get mods you can stat out your character, affecting this energy consumption. Will you go for increasing power and range at the cost of draining energy faster, or give yourself more energy and increase how long channeled abilities are active at the cost of overall damage or effectiveness?\n\nFrom the MMO side there’s Elder Scrolls Online. The game relies primarily on energy gauges. Magicka and Stamina are two to keep an eye on, and refill over time with potions refilling them faster. Even fast travel only has a monetary cost. The closest to a cooldown there is that using fast travel causes the cost to raise for a time and it slowly goes back down to the base price.\n\nThere is a third category which seems even rarer and could be considered a subset of the energy system where everything is a consumable item that you have limited amounts of. This could be considered the guns in shooters I suppose but it’s rare to see it as the spells or special abilities. The most notable is probably the Soulsborne series but those tend to be pretty rare.\n\nThe point of this is one of personal preference. I find that games with the energy systems tend to keep my interest much more than those that rely on cooldowns to cap how often you can use your abilities. It could be argued that they’re both just a different skin on the same thing, limiting how often you spam an ability, since you need to recharge your energy gauge same as you have to wait for the cooldown to refresh. At this point though it feels to me like cooldowns are just used because that’s the standard. “The other popular games do it so this one should do.” From my experience with Warframe I feel like energy systems allow for more versatility, letting you use your abilities more often and playing around with stats to decide if you want something more powerful but less frequent or vice versa. Of course, maybe I’m just missing a cooldown system that handles this same idea incredibly well.\n\nWhich system do you prefer?\n\nWhat are some of the better uses of both cooldowns and energy systems?\n\nIs there a game that handles the consumable items side of things well?\n",

        "text": "I was thinking last night about the difference of climatic encounters in games, particularly between adventure-type like Metroid/Zelda and fighting games like Street Fighter/Tekken. What I noticed is that even though both these games have boss encounters, they could be called, the way the confrontation is handled in each is distinctly different.\n\nEverybody knows the basic formula of a Zelda boss fight. It's structured into stages in which each time the boss nears death it gains new abilities which ramp up the player's challenge. In a fighting game however, the boss characters are usually identical to how they can be played with all their movesets available from the start yet still can create the same sort of dramatic structure (this can change of course, but personally I think these games tend to suffer when they up the health or attack strength of their bosses). You may have to go through a gauntlet of difficult enemies with little breathing room, as in the later Mortal Kombat games, but the enemies aren't so distinct from the systems you've been facing already.\n\nI think one of the major differences in this is discovery. The reason a fighting game boss can be hard is because the most devious movesets, such as that of M. Bison, are saved as to make countering them on the first go difficult. This speaks to the structure of the game some, ascending a ladder which you can fall back down a notch at any time. A Mario style boss will only set you back so far as to be ready to face the boss again immediately afterwards. The familiarity you gain allows the mastery of the mechanics to come from repetition rather than expressly reaction.\n\nThere are games which blend this a bit, having staged bosses that don't fundamentally change when the stages are reached. Many of Shadow of the Colossus' bosses change their patterns when damaged, but you don't have to get out a new item or something to break that stage. The Hands in Super Smash Bros have a variety of movesets that they can use in their forms and mostly just increase in speed of these attacks when a new damage threshold is reached. This hybrid approach can lead to both the base mechanics and the special mechanics (items, events, etc.) feeling less impactful, but also keep the player far more aware of the choices at their disposal rather than seeking a singular solution.\n\nDo you think that boss fights in games could do with being a bit more systemic? How would you attempt to reconcile the energy and deliberate nature of a boss like Ganon in Ocarina of Time with a more fluid approach to grand encounters?",

And they don't provide any other examples, because there are no other. And while these choices are fine by themselves, calling it \"anyway you want\" is complete nonsense. Because in many a games nowadays these two choices are ubiquoutous, so by the mere fact that the devs are mentioning them is testament to the fact that they haven't thought of any alternatives.\n\nTake MGS:V. Their gameplay video showed five ways to go about a mission where you have to eliminate (read: capture/kill) an enemy commander: Sneak in stealthily, go in guns blazing, attach a C4 to a car and blow it up from afar, have your buddy take the target out, or ride a helicopter in Apocalypse Now-style. *That* is variation worth mentioning. Or take something like Dishonored or Deus Ex; immersive sims can really say you can play it however you want. Stealth, action, manipulating enemies with powers, hacking, diplomacy, and any number of combinations. That is worth talking about.\n\nSo what I'm getting at here is: Having a choice between stealth and guns blazing is not anyway you want, and if a game doesn't have any alternatives than those, devs shouldn't say it. My two cents.",

Even if trend they follow is relatively new (like Hero Shooter/Battle Royale modes in games), it already feels just bland to me.\n\nI was sure that as technology develops, we are going to have more complex games, not less complex. I find all that simplifying just sad. Not just video games - it happens with stuff like D&amp;D 5e, too.\n\nAside of (in my opinion) overhyped and overplayed titles, such as Overwatch and Fortnite (which I really wanted to get into, but just couldn't) we got sequels/follow-ups such as Heroes VI/VII, Civilization 4/6, Witcher 2/3, Dawn of War 2/3, Pathfinder 2, D&amp;D 4e and before-mentioned 5e... and many more. I just can't help but to see all these as inferior to previous installments (tho, most clear example of exception is Civ V that does not appear on list).\n\nCivilization itself is saddest one to me, since I expected complexity to increasingly rise, at least with optional DLCs.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "I am currently in the middle of a playthrough of Persona 5, and I'll say off the bat that I absolutely adore the game. It has an amount of strategy that I can appreciate, while keeping battles fast and fluid and providing an interesting story to keep me going. But it's those battles that sometimes throw a wrench in my play, and it's what I want to talk about here.\n\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, there are 2 things you need to know. \n\n1. Your character is the only one that matters in battle. By this I mean, you can keep playing if all of your other party members die, but if you die, it's immediately back to your last save, regardless of how many ways you have of bringing party members back to life.\n2. The enemies have access to the same spells you do (i.e. they don't really have their own special attacks) and some of those spells have a chance to instantly kill the opponent. \n\nThe issue immediately becomes apparent. You're playing through a long stretch of game, far away from any recent save point, and you find an enemy that has one of these instant death attacks. Many of these enemies have no weaknesses, and have just enough health to withstand your attacks long enough to get one of their own off, and that means that in any of these battles there is a chance that you will instantly fail with no way for you to mitigate it. \n\nNow this isn't the only game with instant death attacks. Pokemon also has a small set of moves with a low chance to instantly KO the opposition, but the difference is easy to see. In Pokemon, no one member of your collection can cause an instant blackout. You need all of your pokemon to be hit by these moves to lose, and the chance of that happening is so astronomically low that it basically will not ever happen. There are some action games where enemies have attacks that if not dodged properly, immediately kill you and send you back to the start. However, in all those games you have a chance to at least dodge, block, or simply stay out of their way. \n\nSo this makes me question why these spells are in Persona at all. I can understand wanting to implement an element of stress and danger, and it certainly provides that. Whenever I see one of those enemies that has one of those spells I immediately panic, and the stress does add a quality. However, the fun of that stress does not equal the frustration of having to go all the way back to the previous save through no fault of my own. Why could these attacks not simply have lowered your health to 1, keeping you alive but making death imminent? Or why make the player character the only one to trigger a fail state, even if you have a dozen ways of reviving them? \n\nSo what are your guys thoughts? Does this kind of luck have any place in video games? Does the element of danger outweigh the frustration of failure simply through chance? ",

I personally think that games where the story is a big deal (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, GTA 3, Bioshock) usually lose something when the protagonist is just silent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And by silent I don't mean not having voice lines recorded, many CRPGs allow you to choose what the character is saying, even if there is no audio. *\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Possibly GTA 3 is the game that this bothers me the most, there is something totally lost when you're in a GTA game and all you are doing in cutscene is listening and nodding. And this is one of the reasons why I think GTA Vice City was so impactful and important and is usually way more remembered than GTA 3.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Games like Zelda where much of the story is almost told as \"legends\" and the sequence of facts or opinions/personality of the protagonist doesn't really matter are not something that bother me very much, but a game like Chrono Trigger where the World around you is upside-down and you're thrown in very complicated situations, being accused of things or having to deal with party members, the protagonist being silent is something that gets to me.    \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Half-Life is somewhat of an weird exception, since the first one does it's best to always remind you that you're in a videogame (the same guard everywhere) it wasn't something that bothered me at all, that and the fact that you're mostly in situations where there is nothing much to say other than \"don't go there!\". On Half-Life 2, it sort of bothered me a little more, as I felt speaking about some stuff to the characters was a important, but I think it gave us the feeling of being just a puppet around this world and it sort of matched the storyline.\n  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But if I had to choose between \"all games now have silent protagonists\" vs \"no game now can have a silent protagonist\" I would choose the second. I would of course find very weird to see Link speaking, but I think there is much more to be lost if Tommy Vercetti never said a word.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One thing that I personally feel is that silent-protagonists usually have the opposite effect intended: I don't feel more immersed in the story when my character doesn't speaks, I feel much more like a 'distanced observer' just watching the events of this world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But what about you? Did I miss some game where the protagonist being Silent is a big plus? And how do you feel about silent protagonists in story-driven games? \n\nedit: * For clarification purposes, by CRPGs I mean games like Fallout 1, 2, 3 and others alike\n",

        "text": "Sometimes, a game feels the need to let you experience the frustration that your character feels. The idea being that when your character overcomes whatever event was frustrating you, the player will experience a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nI contend that this does not work. Here are 2 examples.\n\nSpoilers for Undertale and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.\n\n**Undertale**\n\nNear the start of Undertale, after the brilliant introduction with Flowey, you meet Toriel. Toriel is overprotective and doesn't want you to get hurt, so she makes you walk though some ruins while disabling any puzzles. You spend ages walking and doing nothing. At one point, Toriel literally holds your hand and walks over a spike puzzle while you can do nothing.\n\nPresumably, the idea here is to show that your character is getting frustrated by being constrained. Then when you have to fight Toriel, you can feel good about the freedom you have 'earned'.\n\nIn practice though, when my wife was playing, she actually said \"I don't like this game, can we play something else?\" Luckily, I had been spoiled on the internet, so I told her to keep going. Undertale is now one of her most liked games.\n\n**Final Fantasy Tactics Advance**\n\nThroughout the plot of FFTA, the influence of the judges are ever present. In gameplay, one way they affect the world is through the Law system. Each ingame day, the Law changes to determine which moves and abilities are banned in battle.\n\nYou have to play with this system for many hours, constantly checking the law to see if you have any conflicting abilities and if you need to change classes or even party members.\n\nThen,about halfway through the game, you meet someone who can create anti-law cards. Allowing you to nullify certain laws. The game keeps telling you that this is a great accomplishment.\n\nIn practice though, many people got frustrated by the law system and put the game down. I kept going though because I liked other aspects of the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn both of these it didn't matter that the character would eventually overcome the frustration because we can always take the meta decision to stop playing the game.\n\nAre there examples backing this up or examples where you (the player) are made to feel the frustration of the character without making you want to put down the game?",

One of the reasons for this is that they are relatively easy to create compared to 3D games, but as a result the market has become quite saturated with them. \n\nSuper Meat Boy was based primarily around running and jumping without many complex core mechanics, but it combined tight controls with hard-but-fair difficulty and had instant respawns and replays to make the experience less frustrating. \n\nA number of other popular indie platformers (such as Braid and Fez) stood out more because they used a particular innovative mechanic (changing time/rotating between 4 planes) that was not commonly used in other platformers.\n\nGiven the saturation of platformers in the indie market, what features are most important in making platformers stand out from the crowd? Is a single \"new\" mechanic enough, or are there ways for more traditional platformers to distinguish themselves using different methods?",

        "text": "Resident Evil 4 is arguably one of the best games of all time. That isn't nostalgia talking for me, I played it a year ago and it's almost instantly shot up to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI have no affinity for Resident Evil. I've always been a Silent Hill kind of guy when it comes to how I like my horror games. And while I can certainly applaud some of the level design and differing routes in RE 1 and 2, nothing will ever feel as tightly designed as the 4th game. \n\nI made a video on RE4 on my YT channel, for my first video. It's not really all that great, and I really didn't articulate exactly why Resident Evil 4 feels so good, and I'd like to do so now. \n\nResident Evil 4's gameplay loop allows for an asinine amount of actions to take place, with only seconds given to make many tiny micro-decisions in a given scenario. \n\nEach mechanic is layered on top of one another and loop back around in so many ways. \n\nLet's just take Leon's pistol. Facing one enemy, he's given 5 different spots to shoot at on an enemy that will effect it 5 different ways. Head shots will inflict more damage on top of opening up the oppurtunity for a QTE. The body will do some damage, the arms open up another QTE oppurtunity, and the legs will drop the enemy. \n\nThrowing in just one more enemy is going to effect how you handle a situation. You may opt for a quick few headshots for a single enemy, but with 2 you'll be prioritizing some QTEs that are effective for crowd control. \n\nAnd, that's just with your more standard enemy type, with one variation. Every enemy added adds another layer of depth and decision making that you're not actively thinking about, you're being forced to make snap decisions based on what's best.\n\nNow, let's take enemies that have helmets, negating an entire method of disposing of him. Another way RE4 forces the player to constantly switch up how they go about a situation is with ammo and weaponry.\n\nYou're given quite a few options in terms of weaponry. And while a shotgun is almost always effective, you're not always going to have ammo for it. \n\nA game like MGSV gives the player a massive arsenal, but you can actually just ignore 90% of it in favor of 2 or 3 go-to weapons. \n\nRE4 has a whole lot less in terms of sheer number of weaponry, but instead opts for making each weapon count. There is no weapon, other than the SMGs, that I found 0 use for. I was almost constantly popping into the delightful inventory to switch in and out of different weapons to best deal with a given scenario. Limited ammo ensures that the player will almost always be put into a position of having to switch things up, even if they wouldn't try another weapon out otherwise. \n\nWeapons and enemies are the most obvious ways it presents the player with a myriad of options to toy with, but that's not mentioning player/enemy placement, environmental hazards that effect both player and enemy, level design, tactics the game doesn't tell you about, mini-boss enemies like the Chainsaw Ganados, as well as regular bosses that also switch up how you have to tackle a situation, such as the lake monster.\n\nAnd all of these tiny things have a handcrafted feel to them. All these tiny details all add up to an experience where you'll almost certainly never handle a situation the same way, even on different playthroughs. There's always something more to be learned from every playthrough. \n\nNone of these things would matter if the core of RE4 didn't feel so tight. Once they had that core, you could build off of it in so many ways. \n\nWhich is why a 'mini-game' like The Mercenaries, a more score-attack focused affair, can have a player sink as much, if not more time into as they did the main game. \n\nAdding just another layer of depth by having different playable characters, all with their own methods of play that feel vastly different. \n\nSo yeah, another post talking about how god damn great Resident Evil 4 is. I'll leave off with a question, are there any other games that have this level of depth to them? And I don't mean in the sense of a New Vegas, where different playthroughs will see the player going to areas they didn't just spot, but games that have mechanics that build off of and flow into each other in such a smooth and organic way. \n\nI'd say Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 have this depth as well, but the player is by no means forced into doing so, mainly due to how broken the tranq gun is. (Try replaying those games stealthily, without the Tranq dart and without killing anyone, and there's a whole lot of fun to be had.)\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "- [Yep, it's one of those. Hear me out before the flame war at least.\n](https://i.imgur.com/raMDrnR.jpg)\n\n«*Spec Ops: The Line*» is a third person shooter and a darling of artsy gamers everywhere, it has being celebrated as a glorious triumph of gaming as a narrative medium and (this is the tricky part) as a critique of US militarism. I would argue that regardless of whether it success as the first, it utterly fails as the later.\n\nThe plot of *Spec Ops* starts as this:\n\n&gt;Six months prior to the game's events, the worst series of sandstorms in recorded history began across Dubai. The city's politicians and wealthy elite downplayed the situation before evacuating secretly, leaving countless Emiratis and foreign migrant workers behind. […]\n\n&gt;Konrad volunteered the 33rd Infantry Battalion of the United States Army to help relief efforts, defying orders by the Army to abandon the city and its refugees and deserting with the entire battalion. ^1\n\n\nThis entire thing is an embodiment of a sentiment that the USA population seems to have about their foreign policy. One that was best expressed by George W. Bush of all people:\n\n&gt;We judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions. ^2\n\n\n#Part 1: “The baggage of the source material” or “Joseph Conrad was your racist aunt on Facebook”\n\nEverybody and their mom know that Spec Ops is an adaptation of “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad, hence the name of Konrad. So any analysis of the politics in Spec needs to start at Heart.\n\nHeart of Darkness is often described as an anti-imperialist novel, one that could be applied to any imperialism, but this is not really the case. Conrad wasn’t reacting to imperialism in general, he was reacting to the horrors of the Congo Free State, a particularly cruel colony in which 10 million people were exterminated.\n\nConrad’s complain wasn’t “imperialism bad” but “Belgian imperialism bad, unlike the civilizing British imperialism”. As Hochschild puts it:\n\n&gt;Conrad was a man of his time and place in other ways as well. He was partly a prisoner of what Mark Twain, in a different context, called \"the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages.\" Heart of Darkness has come in for some justified pummeling in recent years because of its portrayal of black characters, who say no more than a few words. In fact, they don't speak at all: they grunt; they chant; they produce a \"drone of weird incantations\" and \"a wild and passionate uproar\"; they spout \"strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language ... like the responses of some satanic litany.\"  ^3\n\n\nChinua Achebe, probably the most celebrated African novelist of all time, is a lot more emphatic of his dislike for Conrad, who was as he puts it a “bloody racist” with a book that only carries the message:\n\n&gt;Keep away from Africa, or else! Mr. Kurtz [. . .] should have heeded that warning and the prowling horror in his heart would have kept its place, chained to its lair. But he foolishly exposed himself to the wild irresistible allure of the jungle and lo! The darkness found him out. ^4\n\n\nThis is a baggage that the Heart of Darkness adaptations apparently can’t avoid. If you were to believe “Apocalypse Now” and the endless parade of Vietnam War movies that followed it, even the most terrible Yankee war criminal was a multifaceted and complex character with a tortured soul, while every single armed Vietnamese was a drone in a soulless machine. The Vietnamese civilian is at best a noble savage and at worst a hooker saying “me so horny”. The Vietnamese soldier is a target in an eastern horde. The great tragedy of a war that killed millions of Vietnamese is that killing millions of Vietnamese made the US soldiers feel bad. \n\nThis is so sad, Alexa play “All Along The Watchtower”\n\n- [*There must be some kind of way outta here \\(Cause i don't live here i just drop bombs\\)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY)\n\n#Part 2: “Spec Ops as a glorification of the military” or “Uncle Sam’s character flaw is that he cares too much”\n\nWell look at that; Spec Ops also starts with Jimi Hendrix:\n\n- [*Isn’t that fitting?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqaJpLAX_jA)\n\nThe premise behind Spec Ops is a convoluted mess, it involves some crazy sandstorm and Dubai, a developed nation, falling into an avoidable chaos for seemly no reason. This allows the writing team to come with a very specific setting that wash the hands of the US military industry complex from their vilest sins.\n\nThe worse thing that the US army did as a whole was to tell Konrad to abandon the city (AKA, not intervene at all), meanwhile the worst thing Konrad did was to go to the city in what was at first unambiguously a humanitarian effort. This humanitarian effort somehow descended into a full on war zone for no real reason. The Haiti earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami both proved that military personal destined to humanitarian relief could be abusive, but neither of those cases ever descended into an actual war or anything even close to that.\n\nSpec Ops wants to have a war in the Middle East, but it also wants to have a US military that act entirely out of altruistic intentions or doesn’t act at all. This is completely contradictory with the entire history of the USA interventions on the Middle East.\n\nThis, intentionally or not it doesn’t matter, leads to the portrait of Middle Easter people as barbarians, somehow they descended into an actual war where Haiti and Thailand didn’t.\n\nSpec Ops refuses to even consider the idea that an US military intervention may be inherently motivated by unethical reasons. When things go south and our protagonist needs to go and hunt down Konrad is because war is hell or whatever and Konrad’s hand has being forced into martial law due the circumstances. An altruistic man has turned into a monster because the faceless and evil elite of Dubai abandoned its noble savages behind; Konrad who was simply carrying his white man's burden has fallen prey to inherent lawless violence of the Middle East.\n\nKeep away from the Middle East or else, Mr. Konrad! But he foolishly exposed himself to the wild irresistible allure of the desert and the darkness found him out. The real tragedy of the Dubai apocalypse is that some guys from Minnesota got their souls corrupted by it, and our protagonist had to see it, and that made him sad.\n\n**Notes**\n\n^1 ^Some ^dudes ^at ^Wikipedia.\n\n^2 ^A ^speech ^of ^Dubya ^at ^Dallas, ^2016.\n\n^3 ^Adam ^Hochschild, ^“King ^Leopold's ^Ghost”, ^1998.\n\n^4 ^Chinua ^Achebe, ^“An ^Image ^of ^Africa: ^Racism ^in ^Conrad's ^«Heart ^of ^Darkness»”, ^1975.",

I believe what really got me into gaming was each time again not knowing what you were getting into, figuring out where to go, how the controls worked and eventually discovering what the game was all about both in terms of gameplay and story.\n\nFond memories growing up while pushing all the walls in Wolfenstein, being completely blown away by Max Payne, being amazed by all the great gunplay effects in F.E.AR. endlessly goofing around with the physics in the first Far Cry.\n\nI truly thought it was just me getting older, ruining my own experience by reading and watching all the previews, until last year Prey hit the shelves. It is still possible to lure me in and be truly amazed by the thought and attention that went into creating a world!\n\nSo now I am pondering; is it still me, or is it the gaming industry maturing towards safer business models (online, loot, royale, argh) that simply do not allow (as much) for the things that appeal to me. Or, is it a phase and will the games of “WOW” that once were return?\n\nIs there hope yet or am I simply a dinosaur from an era passed? :)",

Nowadays it seems like the games that are most well known are the ones with the best graphics. While this in itself isn't bad in my opinion it does seem like a lot of the time, money and effort that goes into making the game look as nice as possible could have gone into the actual mechanics of the game along with the story and world building.\n\nWhile graphics are nice they are only a part of the game itself. Thing is that a game is more likely to be remembered for it's story, mechanics and gameplay far more than it's graphics. Another major issue with overly focusing on graphics is that depending on the game focusing on graphics too much can limit said game in some ways by having lower number of levels or a smaller world due to how expensive it would be to make a truly massive lets say MMO with the best graphics possible.\n\nWhat I'm asking is that just because game developers can give their games the best graphics possible should they? Or would players prefer a game that ended up looking less 'nice' than it could have in exhange for more in the other areas?\n",

This is the typical sentiment that many have had towards the game. I don't know how many people have had this thought, but I haven't seen it, so if you would, please hear me out. \n\nBattlefield V will be the first multiplayer EA game in a long time not to have a season pass, DLC map packs or lootboxes. EA have stated that their intention is to sell cosmetics through a store similar to Fortnite (or whatever other example.) \n\nIn order to sell said cosmetics, they've had to open the playable characters and vehicles up to customisation... obviously. And this is where the \"historical inaccuracy\" part comes in. If you were only able to play as a white male in typical army garb, your customisation options are limited to an insane degree. This is why people are running around with katanas, shovels, face paint and claw arms. Not because EA wants to disrespect history, but because they want to sell you as much as possible. \n\nAnd the reason women in the game is quite obvious to me. The most obvious is opening the game up to a market of people that, for whatever reason, would not buy the game unless they could play as a woman, or a black man, or what have you. The second, perhaps less obvious, is that a woman may be unwilling to put money towards customising a male character, or a black person may be unwilling to put money into customising a while person. Now that EA is allowing players to change their player character's race or sex to their own, that person is now another person you can sell WW2-themed hats to. \n\nI just honestly don't believe that EA has gained a sense of morality, and has decided to quintuple down on inclusivity because they really like *all* the people. This is the same company that made Battlefront 2. And also literally every other game, from FIFA to Dead Space 3. This is to say that this company makes decisions *solely* on making more money. That's not to say that maybe someone at DICE just wanted to include women because they genuinely wanted to be inclusive, but, like I said, EA is EA, and EA bad. \n\nThis is my line of thinking. I tried to keep this post succinct, so apologies if it still came of rambly. I also apologise if any of the language I used offended anyone in any way. It's sort of hard to talk about this stuff without constantly saying \"women and minorities\", y'know, like that meme. \n\nHas anyone else thought about this \"issue\" like this. I'm sure they have, I just haven't seen anyone talk about. Anyway, leave your thoughts below and we can discuss, or whatever.  \n\n",

        "text": "I made this post.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9byhmz/how_come_some_people_can_master_a_specific_game/\n\nNow I notice the same thing seems to apply in gaming. No matter how much someone had mastered for example Ninja Gaiden they can never get as good in Halo even if they put the same amount of practise in the game. Not just games in the same genre such as as veteran Resident Evil player failing to get good at Silent Hill, but even sequels and the series and most shocking of all, slightly tweaked version of the game such as the Champion Edition of SF2!\n\nWhy is this? I can understand games in different genres. sequels that expanded the mechanics heavily,and even rivals in the same genre that use vastly different gameplay styles. But having difficulty in slightly upgraded versions of the same game (such as failing to excel at say the expansion packs of Diablo 3 or struggling to surpass your old time in Resident Evil Director's Cut as in the original game)?! I can't understand it! I mean Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 didn't change much to the core game so shouldn't guys who dominated MK3 tournaments do as well in UMK3?\n\nIs there a \"talent\" and \"intuition\" some gamers have that doesn't transition to other games, even slightly upgraded rereleases such as a the Gold Edition of Planet of Death vs the original? Can anyone explain why equal amounts of hardwork won't bring the same results in a different game?\n\nWhat bothers me most is that some of these people have far above average reflexes by any human standards-not just gaming but even bringing their talented reflexes into martial arts, sports, and a host of other hobbies. Yet they can't transition these reflexes itno a game of the same genre or even a slightly upgraded edition and expansion packs to the game! Why is this? I mean while you might need specific training to transition from football to rugby and vice versa, pro players in both sports (especially talented ones) can smoothly transition to and fro after receiving training in the differences of the sports. Why do pro gamers have difficulty doing the smooth transition a kickboxer would have to Muay Thai and a karate blackbelt would have to boxing to and fro?",

Some are obvious like the pay to win thing that seems to be common in a lot of games but I want to hear more detailed reasoning to why MMOs receive a bit of flak. While I've looked up a few MMOs with finding a few interesting and am interested in trying one out I'm a bit wary due to hearing the genre getting flak so I'd like to hear other peoples opinions on it.\n\nI'm also interested to see if some of these problems or perceived problems can be fixed or handled better.",
