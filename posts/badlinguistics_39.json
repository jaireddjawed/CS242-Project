I certainly see the influence of functionalism here, and that's fantastic to me, but it's generally variationalist/Labovian at the expense of (e.g.) Bernstein, Halliday and co.  \n\nAs an example, generally here people frown upon the idea that prestige is attached to certain linguistic choices or varieties, and posts from Reddit gen-pop containing prescriptivism are mocked accordingly. Given that prescriptive norms (regarding capitalisation, for example) are obviously linked to upvotes and so on here on Reddit, however, it seems crazy to refuse to engage in the deeper discussion about why prescriptivism exists, and to instead simply name-and-shame the perpetrators.\n\nWorse, the sub also occasionally conflates folk linguistic explanation with bad linguistics, especially when the tale told is apocryphal. Instead of ridiculing the public-at-large, surely 21st century linguists ought to be:\n\n* Glad people are engaging with linguistics\n* Trying to identify areas in which people make errors for the purposes of pedagogy\n* Interested in the socio-semantic/pragmatic/ideological/discursive motivations underlying both the narratives presented in folk linguistics and their instantiations here on Reddit.  \n\nI rather like that this community exists, but ultimately I have been thinking that what takes place here is kind of unhelpful and, well, elitist. Thoughts?  \n\nEdit: Thanks so much for your responses, guys! What a great community this is. I'm under the pump for the rest of the day, but will attempt to respond to you all when I inevitably start slacking off again. Peace and thanks again",

One thing that came up was languages, and Japanese (which I speak). He couldn't speak it, but he happened to be an expert on the subject. Conversation goes something like this (I'll call him KIA, \"Know-it-all\"):\n\n&gt; Kia: Huh, Japanese? I hear it's related to Finnish.\n\n&gt; Me: No, not really. I don't think it's known to be related to any language apart from like the Ryuku island languages. But some of my friends who speak neither have actually said they think it sounds similar so I guess the phonetic system is similar, I don't really see it though.\n\n&gt; Kia: Well, I have a friend who's lived in Japan and speaks finnish. He says it's almost the same.\n\n&gt; Me: No... it's not.\n\n&gt; Kia: Why would he say that then? I think he'd know since he speaks both languages.\n\n&gt; Me: I don't know why he would, because it's not related.\n\nSince friends of mine had pointed out the similarities to finnish I had researched this before and knew that both Japanese and Finnish have almost no living relatives at all. The conversation above continued for a while because we were grouped together and, well, we were both quite convinced I guess... Thought it was kind of funny. ",

        "text": "In linguistics, descriptivists, such as the famous communist \"academic\" Noam Chomsky, have claimed that no form of language is inherently superior to another. While any man on the street will tell you this is false, and clearly corruptions of language occur all the time (this is taught at primary school level, for crying out loud, how hard can it be to understand?), these fundamentalists refuse to acknowledge the authority of the many prescriptivist (read: sensible) sources demonstrating the benefits of this model of language.\n\nIn an attempt to end this pointless debate, I have come up with a formal proof that descriptivism is *a priori* selfrefuting. My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. A word *w* may mean anything it is used to mean (*the Descriptivist Axiom*)\n2. If person *A* uses *w* to have a meaning *m* (𝓜 being a one place predicate, approximately \"x means *m*\", where *m* is some arbitrary meaning), then 𝓜*w*\n3. If person *B* uses *w* to have a meaning of *not m*, then ¬𝓜*w*\n4. There is nothing preventing 2. and 3. from occurring in the same possible world, according to the assumption in 1.\n5. Therefore, there is a possible world in which (𝓜*w* ∧ ¬𝓜*w*) = ⊤. This is a contradiction!\n6. ∴, by *reductio*, the Descriptivist Axiom must not hold.\n\nI will be submitting this to the highest of the academic journals in the field of logic and reason. I will expect my Nobel prize within the year. I will now take any questions you have regarding the elegance of this proof.",

Lots of different reasons are given. \n\nTamil and Sanskrit make an appearance. \n\nSome badling from me in there about alphabets and writing systems. \n\n\"They were among the first to develop a true alphabet (where each character represents a phonetic sound)\"\n",
