This results in a “Big Bang” event causing a new dimension full of particles.\n\nNow this new dimension will repeat the process and distill or evolve into a lower or higher dimension respectively. \n\nThat’s how we have multiple dimensions. Born from one another. I think it would make the most sense to start at a higher dimension at true time zero. Maybe reality had infinite dimensions and here we are at the last few stops of reality.\n\nThanks for reading.",

It was the family's first time seeing it, and it was pretty cool for sure. But it got me thinking, what do the uncontacted tribes and people outside of modern civilization think when they see something like that go by. A shooting star here and there is cool, and I'm sure they see the ISS go by, but the Starlink is something completely abnormal. What'd everyone else think about when they saw it?",

        "text": "I was reading up on this Wikipedia article about the day the earth smiled (linked below).\n\nIt describes an image taken by NASA spacecraft Cassini in 2013. The image was taken from Jupiter which shows the earth in the bottom right corner, and according to the article, people were encouraged to look up and smile in celebration.\n\nJupiter is 0.00008 light years from earth, which equates to approx 45 minutes. So assuming they sent a signal at 12:00pm travelling at the speed of light to the spacecraft to take a picture, it would arrive at the space craft at 12:45pm, and a picture would be taken and sent back to the earth at the speed of light, arriving at 1:30pm. (I think anyway)\n\nSo, what time would the people on earth need to look up and smile in order to be captured by the picture?\n\n11:15? 12:00? 12:45? Or I’m I completely off…\n\nI’ve been pondering this a while, but my smooth brain can’t figure out. Please help!\n\n[wiki link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Smiled)",
