I learned from my advisor that I am on the border of academic probation and just barely qualified to keep my scholarship. I also recently was rejected from a dream internship after reaching the reference check phase. I’m utterly crushed, to say the least, and I feel like a failure. I’ve been depressed with some passive suicidal ideation as of late and i’ve started pushing away my friends and loved ones. I’m not giving up (i’m still trying to do better, or at least want to, in my classes and applying to other internships), but I can’t shake this hopeless feeling and can’t find the motivation to get up to go to class and get all my reading and outlining done on time. How do I move forward and stop letting this determine my self-worth?",

Minimum wage jobs won’t hire me. McDonalds probably wouldn’t hire me. Most of the people here are literally perfect. They have their whole life planned. I don’t. Most employers look at my resume and put me in the same category as a convicted child molester. Honestly, I’m essentially a child molester in terms of employment prospects. \n\nMy question is this: is it worth it for me to go to law school?

I did not realize, they advertised on their flyer that kids would be left unattended if not picked up by 3pm. My wife arrived before 3pm to find the kids were not where they should’ve been. They were left unattended on a playground. What if the parents were in a car accident and couldn't make it? No emergency contacts would be called? This is unsafe and sounds illegal. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hey all! So I am a recent JD Grad (May 2022). I was doing a Fellowship after graduation but I had to leave that in order to have time to study for re-taking the Bar in February. Now that that is out of the way, I am applying for positions of all types.\n\nI have one offer from a job listed as \"Judicial Tipstaff/Law Clerk\" at one of the Court of Common Pleas in PA. In all honesty, I wasnt even thinking about any distinction before I applied. I saw the opening on the job portal and just fired out my resume without second thought. I got an interview and just got the offer. I have not accepted yet, I am still waiting to hear back from some other places. But before I do potentially accept, I want to clear up some confusion about the distinction between the two.\n\nIs there a distinction between the two titles in terms of work done? The description of the job on the portal says \"Tip Staff/Law Clerk would conduct legal research, writing, analytical skills and the tasks would be drafting legal memorandum and court decisions\" which seems like the typical clerk duties anywhere so idk if I'm just thinking a little too hard, but when looking at the pay for this job compared to the pay of clerkships I've applied to in NJ... it makes me think there is more to the distinction than the name. A little googling has got me a little more weary and needing some clarity before I make my decision.\n\nIf anyone has any knowledge on this and can enlighten me, that would be very appreciated. Thanks!",

I have no litigation experience from law school but always figured I'd do civil litigation or maybe estate planning and would be able to pick things up on the job. I worked in the same city as the mid-sized firm last summer so I'm already used to it somewhat and the prosecutor job would be a bit of a commute as I'd probably live at my parents to save money/pay down loans (so billables might not make any difference free time-wise). Also, the 1850 billable req't is met by whatever you bill, even if the number is reduced.

I’m having a lot of issues finding a summer position, and I was wondering if this was common? I’ve had the career office at my school check over my resume, have a years worth of full time work experience from my gap year (although I guess I’m still basically K-JD), try my best to network/have some mentors, have been applying pretty widely and not being super picky but I can’t really seem to even get a call back? I did get one interview but kinda bombed it because of anxiety and ended up getting rejected from the position :/ \n\nI guess I’m just wondering if this is representative of what career hunting will always be like or if this is just an issue bc I’m a 1L? I guess it’s just a bit discouraging to hear all of my classmates slowly start getting selected for jobs and not know what I’m doing wrong here.\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

They thought my education background was a perfect fit, were impressed I was familiar with and able to ask questions about the most recent major cases in their practice area, and the lead interviewer actually told me I'd definitely be hearing back from them.\n\nNow, a footnote to all this is the fact that the job posting on Symplicity asked for a writing sample, but they must have messed up somehow because the system didn't actually LET you submit one; it only accepted a resume, transcript, and cover letter. Fast forward to a couple days after the interview, and I get an urgent email, phone call, voice mail, and text all within 7 minutes telling me they were \"interested in moving forward with my application,\" but they needed a writing sample. I am not confident in my legal writing at all, but I went ahead and sent an excerpt from my moot court brief (the one our CSO always recommends we use). I figured if nothing else it was free of typos and showed I knew how to use complicated citations correctly. \n\nIt's going on 2 weeks soon and I haven't heard a thing since then.\n\nLesson: Take your writing sample seriously. An unimpressive writing sample can tank your application even if they love everything else about you. If you don't feel confident about your briefs from LRW or moot court, you probably need to go through and rewrite significant chunks of it rather than assuming employers will just skim through it!",

It would be really cool to do class actions in particular. The plaintiff-side firms in my city don’t hire as regularly and it’s harder to figure out how much they pay. But I would get more immediate litigation experience, which is a definite plus. And the work seems to align better with my ideals. \n\nWhat would you choose to do?

I originally wanted UT Austin or NYU, but have been strongly advised to try Colombia instead and that if I want to practice in New York (I'm sitting the bar there this summer) I need an LL.M from at LEAST a T-14, preferably Ivy. \n\nI graduated with what translates to a 3.86, however I know some universities use conversions with a 5% range (so for 65-69% in a UK degree, they would regard any percentage within this range as a 3.7 rather than look to grade individually). However, I have insanely impressive extra curricular, including establishing my own law review and 10 years of work experience &amp; volunteering, 3 years being in the top law firms in my country. I also have \\*diversity points\\*, extremely strong references and extenuating circumstances for my degree (I suffered a disability throughout my final years). \n\nBasically I've no idea where I stand when it comes to admissions. I know my grades are going to fuck me over lots and despite all of the other factors here I'm wondering is it even worth my time applying to Ivy given my grades. I'm not sure where is feasible for me to try so would really appreciate any insights or pointers you guys may have for applying - thanksssss!",

Unfortunately, as an undergrad I wasn't thinking about law school as an option so I'm poorly prepared for it (no relevant club or extracurricular experience like mock trial). Additionally, I have a 3.0 Electrical Engineering GPA from a fairly prestigious private university (think Northeastern or Tufts). That's low for a T14.\n\nI'm considering Law vs MBA or MS because taking on cases, whether it's protecting the environment, making sure health care works or \"flashier\" types of law like criminal or corporate sounds kind of exciting. At least, more exciting than staring at a screen all day and feeling like what I'm doing doesn't mean shit. I literally feel like I'm wasting my life. I don't have the expertise to do something cool like help build a new product and most engineering these days is just writing software.\n\nMy questions (for context I live in California):\n\n1. One thing that's holding me back is Salary. Right now as an engineer I'm making $135k a year. How long would it take me to work up to that salary in a Law career? (I assume I'd have to start as a paralegal, then an associate and so on)\n2. What does the daily work look like? Is it alot of typing up/filling out documents? What are you actually doing most of the day?\n3. What can you do with a JD if you don't pass the Bar (I've heard it's really hard to pass)?",

I made it to the finals for an immigration fellowship but had to turn down the placement because it was in the middle of nowhere in a state where I have no connections. I'm really, really, really stressed out and depressed.\n\nMy resume is mostly humanitarian immigration based, although I had a summer internship with a Superior Court judge (sadly she has no clerkship openings). My clinical work was all immigration - representing an asylum-seeker, adjustment of status, VAWA, etc. I didn't mean to lock myself into one field this way, but I am truly passionate about it, which is why my work experience is this way. But I am also very passionate about making enough money to live... Ideally I'd love for a entry-level salary in the $75-$100k  range. And I want to stay in DC. \n\nWhat comes to mind automatically is agency work (not ICE, but maybe HUD or USDA or something like that) but I'm completely unsure of how to pivot and rework my immigration centered experiences to make myself marketable to the federal government. But at this point, I'd kind of be open to anything that wouldn't require me to litigate a lot, and would consider JD preferred jobs. My school's career center has been extremely unhelpful and they actually seemed mad at me for turning down the fellowship placement. \n\nIf anyone has any advice, or had a similar experience entering the job market, or even a kind word, I'd be very appreciative.",

I transferred to my current school a year and a half ago, got excellent grades (magna cum laude range), but have really been treading water on the career front. I had an SA position at a firm that I couldn’t stand (witnessed a lot of sexual harassment there), tried and failed to get a clerkship, tried and failed to get an honors attorney position at a federal agency, and am now just sending out applications to any place that’s hiring. I don’t really care about salary, but I’d like to do something socially useful at least.\n\nI’m not super surprised that things haven’t worked out for me; despite being a good student, I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health the last few years and have been very uninvolved at my school and made few connections with professors. I’ve tried to lean on the people I have gotten to know to see if they have any leads, but I think that’s run dry. I don’t have a demonstrated interest in any area of law really, which is definitely handicapping me at this point since most of the places that are still hiring are public interest and government jobs that want a strong commitment to their fields.\n\nI know this is an unusual situation, but has anyone gone through something similar, and if so, do you have any suggestions? I don’t know if I could take the embarrassment of going through all this work and ending up unemployed haha.",

        "text": "I say this with the utmost humility: I’m doing well in law school. I’m in the top 5% of my class (at one point ranked #2), on law review with a pending published note, have gotten several CALIs, and got a biglaw gig for 2L summer. How this happened? I dunno. I’m first generation and let’s just say I don’t look like the other students in my class if you catch my drift. That being said, I try to stay very quiet and humble about my accomplishments because I know a lot of ppl busting their ass and not seeing the results they deserve. I’m also very aware that “good performance” in law school is hardly indicative of “good performance” in actual practice. I make it a point not to be friends with other people who I know are doing well because, honestly, most of them are obnoxious assholes.\n\nAnywho, every time I’m around these “obnoxious assholes” I can’t help but feel like I’m not as smart/qualified as them. I don’t know every judge in the area on a personal basis, I don’t know every rule in the BB, and honestly I couldn’t tell you off the top of my head what was on my contracts I exam. I know it sounds silly but I have this crippling fear the school made a mistake with my grades/rank and I’m not supposed to be here. There have been times where my peers have said stuff like “oh you had THAT Professor - everyone knows they’re an easy grader,” etc, or have suggested I’ve gotten jobs because I got to participate in minority events etc. idk, the whole thing bums me out and makes me scared to death of the big law world. Can anyone relate? Do people continue to act like this outside of law school? I know I need to get over this mental inferiority game but damn it’s hard.",
