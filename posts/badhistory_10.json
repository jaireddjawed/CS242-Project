        "text": "To start, a disclaimer: I’m a specialist on the Ottoman Empire, not Renaissance Italy, so forgive me and go right ahead and correct any mistakes here. \nAssassin’s Creed II is a game I highly enjoy, but playing through it again recently, I realized that its portrayal of women was making me a bit uncomfortable, not because of what is in the game so much as what is missing. None of its female characters are depicted as bound by any of the social constraints which would have shaped their lives in reality.\n\nFirst, some basic bad history about the courtesans. The game’s database entry on courtesans makes it clear that the developers had no idea what they were talking about, starting with the fact that they’re called “courtesans” in the first place. While courtesans may possibly have had their origins in the late 15th century they are mostly associated with the 16th and 17th, and in any case were tied to aristocratic *courts*, hence the name. Courtesans in Assassin’s Creed in fact represent regular prostitutes and it outright describes them as such. The database describes prostitution as a “popular occupation” for women “whose only other options in most cases were staying with their families or living in a convent.” This is almost horrifyingly backwards. Prostitution was a *last resort* for women who *didn’t have the option* of getting married or staying in a convent. It wasn’t a “popular” alternative choice for adventurous women who didn’t want to follow those other paths, it was a product of desperation for those who failed for one reason or another to find a place in society deemed socially acceptable, either because they had been dishonored in some way (e.g. losing their virginities, consensually or not) or because they were from families too poor to get them the necessary dowry. Then it goes on: \n\n&gt; “Italian society supported prostitution, and many brothels were regulated by the government.” \n\nNow it’s true that Italian society generally supported prostitution, but this is very different from supporting prostitutes. Prostitution was seen as important as a sexual outlet for young men, to prevent them from pursuing respectable women or engaging in sodomy. Florence established an organization for regulating prostitution in in 1403, the Onestà, and its duty was **to protect regular society from the prostitutes**, not to improve their lives or safety, as the game’s brief description implies. It’s like saying that Judaism was supported by Italian society because it was regulated in ghettoes and not illegal. Prostitutes were forced to live on the margins of society, and states generally tried to maintain a strict and visible distinction between prostitutes and “respectable women.” This meant forcing prostitutes to register with the state, live in poor neighborhoods, operate out of brothels, and wear distinctive clothing marking them as separate and dishonorable. The database mentions some of these restrictions but says that they were only put into place at the end of the 15th century, which is simply wrong and contributes to Ubisoft’s distorted image of a happy, tolerated prostitution in the mid-to-late-15th century by allowing them to leave them out of the game entirely.\n\nAs they appear in the game, the prostitutes are all cheerful, rich, and loved by everyone. We never see anyone hurling abuse at them or being uncomfortable with their presence. We never see the guards harassing them. We never see them in desperation or poverty. There is not a hint of any of the hardships that came with being a prostitute in 15th century Italy.\n\nBut to move from prostitutes to an issue directly impacting the player character, we have the case of Ezio’s early-game love interest, Cristina, a girl from a mercantile family. Early in the game Ezio sneaks into her house through the window in order to have sex with her, an adventure which ends in the morning with her father catching them together. The point of this is to build Ezio’s character by showing his sexuality as well as introducing the player to a core concept of the game – having to escape the guards Cristina’s father sends after you. The problem is Cristina’s father here acts basically like a 21st century conservative American dad who’s trying to scare his daughter’s pesky boyfriend away. For Ezio, it makes sense that this is no big deal. He’s a young man and his sexuality would have been regarded as normal (indeed his father shows this by praising him for reminding him of his own youth). But for Cristina and her family, this would have been devastating – see Guido Ruggiero’s description of a similar case (p. 110):\n\n &gt; First, it threatened their family’s honor, as her behavior was seen as reflecting on the honor of her family as a whole. It also, of course, threatened the honor of Lisabetta and, if it became known, might ruin her chances to marry and become a wife, the honorable status required of an adult woman.\n\nThis was a world in which the maintenance of one’s personal and family honor meant a great deal. By shouting for the guards Cristina’s father revealed to the whole city what had happened, making the relationship public. Yet this has no consequences for Cristina at all. We learn later that she’s gotten married and is living a normal life. No sense of the horrible danger of their affair, or highlighting the callousness of Ezio’s attitude toward getting caught, or of the consequences that Cristina would undoubtedly have had to suffer through.\n\nIn this sense, Assassin’s Creed II portrays Renaissance Italy as a consequence-free sexual fantasy. Yet while getting caught in bed was consequence-free for Ezio, for Cristina it could have been life-destroying. And for the prostitutes, their lifestyle was an option of last resort for those too poor or too unfortunate to find a normal place in society, and thus cast to its margins to live in poverty and humiliation, not an occupation staffed by happy, ever-consenting women. Assassin’s Creed makes use of these figures in a historical setting, not to raise tough and mature questions about them but instead to fuel this fantasy.\n\nBut I could go on about any number of issues like that. There are of course an infinity of ways at which Assassin’s Creed II fails to properly represent Renaissance Italy (and as a game, it doesn't necessarily have to). What bothers me about this issue in particular is that it’s so closely tied to the story and the character of Ezio. Ezio’s relationship to women and sexuality is a core part of his character, and Ubisoft did not take any steps toward exploring what his actions would have meant for the women he encounters in their 15th-century setting.\n\nTl;dr: 15th-century Italy had a society which encouraged sexual openness for young men, but fiercely sought to control the sexuality of its girls and women. The consequences this would have had for the game’s female characters make no appearance whatsoever, despite his sexuality being a major feature of Ezio's character.\n\n* Brakcett, John K. “The Florentine Onestà and the control of prostitution.” *Sixteenth Century Journal* 24 (1993): 273-300.\n* Hughes, Diane Owen. “Bodies, disease, and society.” In *Italy in the Age of the Renaissance, 1300-1550,* edited by John M.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/738p8h/cutting_helmets_and_cutting_down_badhistory_a/",
        "text": "Hello, I’ve mostly lurked around here and now decided to make my first post, I hoped I managed to get it nice and coherent. I’m interested in arms and armour, so I have come across several never-ending arguments about weapon x versus armour. Here I will write about a not-so common one: sword cuts against helmets and mail armour, more specifically note 1 of this [article](https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2011/cutting_edge_technology_by_k_j_parker) by fantasy author K.J. Parker (pseudonym for Tom Holland), which contains a good deal of badhistory (the rest of the article has some too, but I will pass on that). This will primarily be about the mid-13th century Maciejowski Bible/Morgan Picture Bible, that contains many scenes like [this one](http://www.themorgan.org/collection/medieval-and-renaissance/manuscript/158530# ) with many swords chopping through armour. I’ll draw heavily from the reasoning and primary sources in an essay by Richard Abels, on which I will expand upon and add some more sources. \n\n&gt; (1) Actually, it’s a moot point whether swords in the hands of ancient swordsmen could cut mail and cleave helmets. Modern researchers say no, but back in the 13th century they were pretty sure they could, to judge from contemporary literature and art. For example, the Maciejowski Bible, an illuminated manuscript painted for the French crusader king Louis IX, has many scenes showing swords cutting armour in graphic, almost photographic detail. The context is worth considering:\n\n&gt;1.The Maciejowski Bible was commissioned by an experienced and horribly enthusiastic fighter, who wouldn’t have been amused by gross inaccuracies\n\nHere is the first and fundamental problem with the author’s reasoning: that unrealistic depictions of combat wouldn’t be accepted by the audience of the Maciejowski Bible (it’s actually not at all certain that it was commissioned by Louis IX, though it was most likely made for members of the nobility). This is a big assumption since it could be the case that they had a willing suspension of disbelief for this kind of things.  Parker does not eliminate the possibility that this is the case, he doesn’t consider it at all. \n\n&gt;2.The painter records arms, armour, clothes and footwear with great care and precision. The illustrations are meant to be totally realistic.\n\nThe depictions of objects are indeed detailed and largely realistic, but they still follow some artistic conventions. For example, the Israelites are using triangular heater shields and some of them have great helms, while their enemies use round shields and only ever have open-faced helmets. This is similar to how contemporary manuscript distinguished Crusaders and “Saracens”, as well as other cases of “west vs east” such as depictions of Alexander the great fighting against the Persians. This ties in to other crusader motifs in the illustrations.\n\nAbels have pointed out that the warfare in the Maciejowski Bible is unrepresentative in that it depicts many battles, but few sieges and no pillaging which was more common than pitched battles. The focus on battles might be argued be due to the fact that it portraying the biblical battles, but the illustrations disregard many instances of geographical features of these battles and instead show battles being fought outside towns. This is something that it have in common with tournaments, which Abels argue is much more likely that the illustrators of the Bible and their patron have witnessed since the last battle in France before it was made was in 1214 ^1 So tournaments in combination with chivalric literature like chansons de geste which contains gratuitous violence and similar armour- splitting feats (a bit more on this below) are therefore a more likely inspiration for these battle scenes rather than actual warfare. Here I would add that that this influence can also be seen in that the Maciejowski Bible focus on knights fighting other knights mainly on horseback and depicts relatively few common foot soldiers, which did not commonly participate in tournaments.\n\nMoreover suspension of disbelief can be quite selective. Abels likened the audience of the Maciejowski Bible to modern day soldiers playing FPS-games which differs substantially from real warfare. To further draw on this analogy, games can depict real-life guns in a detailed and accurate manner down to the sound they make and at the same time show soldier getting shot and being completely fine after they have been treated with a medic kit or just waiting a little while. Likewise it’s possible that the fighting in the Maciejowski bible is unrealistic while the armour and weapons are correctly illustrated. \n\n&gt;3.The battle scenes are generic images of warfare rather than particular exploits of superhuman heroes. The armour-cutters are just plain folks, not legendary heroes of whom exceptional feats are to be expected.\n\nIt seems Parker thinks that descriptions of great heroes fighting can be unrealistic. I can agree that with this since for example the eponymous hero in the poem ‘Raoul de Cambrai’ cuts through an enemy’s helmet and mail down to the shoulder and in ‘The Song of Roland’ the knight Olivier cuts through an enemy’s helmet, head, body hauberk, saddle and horse. I hope it’s obvious to anyone that this is highly exaggerated. But if medieval nobility could accept grossly unrealistic actions such as these, why couldn’t somewhat less unrealistic things also be acceptable and the armour being chopped through in the Maciejowski Bible be an example of that? \n\n&gt;A redoubtable modern experimental archaeologist, one Mike Loades, recently set out to disprove the Maciejowski Bible once and for all. He acquired a very fine reproduction sword and had a very fine reproduction helmet made, looking just like the ones in the Bible, and proceeded to bash on the helmet with the sword for all he was worth. He managed to dent it, but that was all.\n\n&gt; Proof positive; except that—\n\n&gt;1.The very fine helmet, like the very fine sword, was made of modern steel. Mr Loades didn’t go into details, but the industry standard for modern repro helmets is something like 2mm cold rolled steel sheet. Medieval armour was made of iron, not steel, and the sheets were hammered by eye with sledgehammers, not rolled in a computer-controlled mill. King Louis would’ve traded you the Loire valley and half of Touraine for a helmet, or a sword, as good as the ones Mr Loades used for his test.\n\nWhile modern day medieval-style armour can be much better due to superior metal, this is not necessarily the case. For example in a series of experiments at the arsenal in Graz where they fired period black powder guns, a piece of armour made of 2.8mm-3mm mild steel were better at absorbing kinetic energy from bullets than a modern-made mild steel plate of 3mm. This result was ascribed to the armourer’s skill in cold-working and hardening the surface of the armour. Without knowing the details of the armour tested it is difficult to know if it is significantly superior to period armour. \n\n&gt;2.Most of the armour-chopping in the Maciejowski Bible is done by men on horseback. Add the momentum of a moving horse to the strength of the human arm, and you vastly increase the force of the blow; rather like the difference between getting punched by a pedestrian and hit by a moving car\n\nA better analogy would be the difference between getting punched by a pedestrian and getting punched by someone driving by you in a car. A rider and a horse is not one solid object so there is a limit to how much momentum from the horse can be transferred to the sword-blow.\n\n&gt;3.Mr Loades is one of the most skilled swordsmen currently alive, but he’s a 21st century weakling. They were stronger back then. They could shoot bows that we can’t draw. They could till an acre a day with an ox-drawn plough—we know they could, because that’s the original definition of an acre, but you try it and see how far you get. They could fight all day in heavy armour, which exhausts us in a matter of minutes. Medieval noblemen trained intensively with weapons from childhood. The fact that we can’t do it is no proof that it can’t be done.\n\nWhile I can’t say how skilled and strong Mr Loades is compared to people in the past, it is a good point that it can be difficult to replicate skills and physical abilities of things done in the past. But that doesn’t mean that people in the past had a level of strength that is unreachable today, it is possible for people to achieve such strength with enough training. That they could shoot bows “we” can’t draw is true for most of “us”, but not for people who train for it, such as members of the English Warbow Society, can shoot bows as powerful as the ones in the past. One can probably find a good deal of people who can plough an acre in the developing world, but I doubt they have Herculean strength. I also highly doubt that people could fight all day in armour, just because a battle took a whole day doesn’t mean that everyone was fighting for longer periods of time. At Agincourt the French men-at-arms got exhausted before they even came to grips with the English when they walked on foot through a muddy field.\n\nThere is another test that I would like to bring up since it is made on an antique helmet, although being from another place and time period: http://www.shinkendo.com/kabuto.html \nSo here someone who is well-trained in wielding swords striking an antique helmet^2, making what is described as record-breaking damage. The conditions are stacked against the helmet since it is on a hard, rigid surface so there is no cushioning effect from the suspension of the helmet or from a person wearing it, and the cuts are done with a big, wound up movement of which there wouldn’t be time for in a battle. The sword manages to put in wide gashes, but it is quite different from what’s happening in the Maciejowski Bible were several sword blows manage to split helmets almost or completely in two and in addition goes deeply through the mail coif, fabric coif, and skull underneath.\nMoving over to historical accounts of fighting, there is some evidence that similar things to this could have happened. From the ‘History of William Marshal’: \n&gt; …the Marshal landed a blow in return that cut through helm and hood and into flesh. It stopped him in his tracks; shocked, stunned, knocked senseless by the blow, he fell and lay unmoving, unable to rise. The Marshal, weary now – he’d done more than his share! – sat on him to hold him fast…\n\nNotice that while the sword got through the helmet, it didn’t go deeply enough to kill the person. William Marshall was described as being tired when he did this, but bear in mind that this is from a partial biography that was written to idolize him. And on the other hand later in the same book the when William Marshal is fighting against the count of Perche:\n\n&gt; … let go of his reins and gripped his sword in both hands; then William the Marshal dealt him three successive blows upon the helm, so strong and fierce that they left clear marks upon it whereupon the count collapsed and went tumbling from his horse...\n\nHere the author found it noteworthy to point out that the cuts were so strong that they made clear damage, but they didn’t cut through the helmet. So the kind of blows that William Marshall gave previously would likely be untypical, while in the Maciejowski Bible every single sword-cut that hits armour cuts deeply through it^3. This becomes clearer when compared to more general accounts of battles like Orderic Vitalis’ description of the battle of Bremule in his ‘Ecclesiastical History’:\n\n&gt;I have been told that in the battle of the two kings, in which about nine hundred knights were engaged, only three were killed.  They were all clad in mail and spared each other on both sides, out of fear of God and fellowship in arms; they were more concerned to capture than to kill the fugitives\n\nOrderic may have exaggerated a bit how few were killed, as a monk he had reasons to inflate the capacity of Christian mercy. Still, it is well-documented that knights commonly to take each other captives in battle, of which there would be few opportunities to do if it was so easy to cut through armour as the Maciejowski Bible portrays it to be\nWilliam the Breton’s work ‘The Philippiad’ gives an account of the battle of Bouvines that in more detail describes the protective value of armour (emphasis mine): \n&gt; The silk coverings attached to the top of the armour so that everyone could be recognized by these signs have been so cut up and ripped into a thousand shreds by **the maces, swords, and lances which are pounding on the armour so as to break it** that each combatant can barely distinguish his friends from his enemies.\n\n&gt;…\n\n&gt;**But even then, iron cannot reach them unless their bodies are first dispossessed of the armour protecting them,** so much as each knight covered his members with several layers of iron and enclosed his chest with armour, pieces of leather and other types of breastplate. **Thus nowadays, modern men take much greater care to protect themselves than did the ancients who would often, as we learned from our reading, fall by the thousands in a single day.**\n                                                                                                                                  \nThe last bit is interesting since it gives another possible reason for why pictures of swords cutting armour were accepted. It indicates that medieval people had the notion of battles being bloodier in earlier periods (like in biblical times) and wanting to depict these battles while at the same time having the combatants wearing medieval armour. \n\nSo in short while sword can cut armour shallowly on a few times, the portrayals of swords cutting deeply through armour often that is found in art like the Maciejowski Bible and some medieval literature are contradicted by narrative accounts of contemporary battles. This should therefore be taken as exaggerations and artistic licence.\n\nEDIT: Clarified my conclusion a bit\n\nNotes:\n\n^1 Though here I would add that there would be several small skirmishes during pillaging and sieges, but I don’t think that detracts much from the overall argument.\n\n^2 I add the caveat that I don’t know how typical the quality of the helmet is.\n \n^3 With possible exception of folio [11r](http://www.themorgan.org/collection/crusader-bible/21), where a cut in the upper right corner is obscured and its result is therefore uncertain.\n\nSources:\n\n“Cultural Representations of Warfare in the High Middle Ages: The Morgan Picture Bible”, by Richard Abels in “Crusading and Warfare in the Middle Ages: Realities and Representations.

        "text": "Note: I finally finished this\n\n[Here](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/116363573/), [this image specifically](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1471/74/1471741032456.jpg), [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RadioITEL/status/8354009066403430400), [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HJ4Hh0hyXQ) and [this website].\n\nSo I've seen this claim many, *many*, **many** times all over the inter-webs and various platforms of social media, seeing as it's apparently a popular rhetoric for conspiracy theorists. What I could not find however, is a through, line by line analysis (and debunking) of the claim. So I decided to make one myself, (or at least one to the best of my ability)\nEvery time I see the image/claim, the number tends to be larger than the last one: [47](http://www.rense.com/general85/banished.htm), 54, [100](https://theuglytruth.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/over-a-hundred-locales-expelled-jews-before-zionism-was-even-a-factor-why/), [109](https://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm), [+1,000](http://fathersmanifesto.net/jewsexpelled.htm) etc.\n\nThe statement usually tends to be something along the lines of \"Jews have been kicked out of X number of countries but it's always antisemitism, not what they did/do, but it's no problem right because you can do anything if your God's chosen people amirite?\". Or something like that.\n\nI'll be looking at the list given in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr9fyxUgkok) and [this website](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/79.html) and deciding if 1) It even happened and 2) whether or not it was a result of \"Jewish behaviour\", whatever that's supposed to mean. \n\n&gt; 250 AD - Carthage - expulsion\n\nRight off the bat we have something which I'm going to assume it completely made-up, simply Googling it give me nothing, and the only source I can find says [this](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/carthage).\n\nIf I find similar results on other \"events\" I'll just say so.\n\n&gt; 415 AD - Alexandria - expulsion\n\nCorrect, this did happen. [Cyril of Alaxandria](https://archive.is/s0dt#selection-1225.375-1225.385), who was the Patriarch at that time, used a mob to drive out the Alexandrian Jews that were living in that quarter of the city. \n\nAs for the reasoning, it had more to do with the fact that they *were Jewish* over anything else. The reason for the expulsion had to do with the conflict between Orestes the prefect and Cyril. When Orestes asked for help from Jewish elders to aid in capturing monks who instigated violence towards various Hellenist communities, several of Cyril's men overheard and soon became a cry of sorts to \"drive out the Jews\". \n\nConsidering that Jews had been in the city since it was founded by Alexander the Great, was home to the [Greek Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) and that similar violence was seen by [pagans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia) and [other Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novatianism), I pretty sure I'd be alright if I said it \"wasn't a result of Jewish behaviour\".\n\n&gt; 554 - Diocèse of Clermont (France) - Expulsion\n&gt; 561 - Diocèse of Uzès (France) - Expulsion\n\nThis one was difficult to locate, the Bishop of Diocèse of Clermont from 554-571 was Cautinus, and I found nothing anti-jewish that happened particularly in those years, aside from [various canons](https://books.google.ca/books?id=bxR7vcRjfM4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=Cautinus+to+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fLOPKxLKFM&amp;sig=a-CHFO_dNKBAQ1J7KS-6D_av1i0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP5qOm363WAhUH04MKHcNHDhIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cautinus%20to%20jews&amp;f=false)\n\nWhat it *might* be referring to is [this](http://www.haaretz.com/misc/haaretzcomsmartphoneapp/.premium-1.591194) in the year 576, but this wasn't a forced expulsion, the Jews left on their own accord because they refused to be forced into Christianity.\n\nMost likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 612 - Visigoth - Expelled\n&gt; 642 - Visigoth - Expelled\n\n\nWhile Jews weren't \"expelled\", they did suffer persecution after the conversion of Reccard I from Arianism to Christianity. According to Historian Jane Gerber  \n&gt; that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\". In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism[1](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Jews_of_Spain.html?id=_qmpcSlB8wYC&amp;redir_esc=y). \n\nSo the reason for the persecution was essentially \"not being Catholic\". Before Reccard, they were treated just fine in the kingdom.\n\n&gt; 855 - Italy - Expelled\n\nWell... In 855, Louis II *attempted* to banish all Italian Jews, but his order largely failed because of his conflict with the Byzantines. So he taxed them instead. \n\nI couldn't find any justification.\n\n&gt; 876 - Sens - Expelled\n\nThis likely never happened as the only mention of such occurrence was in a 11th century chronicle that was probably discussing what happen in [Mainz the same year](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sens)\n\n&gt; 1012 - Mainz - Expelled \n\nYes, this did happen, Emperor Henry II expelled all Jewish families in the city after a polemicist pamphlet written by a convert to Judaism (Wecelin)\n\nThey were allowed to return the next year.\n\n&gt; 1182 - France - Expelled \n&gt; 1182 - Germany - Expelled\n\nIn 1182 Philip Augustus \"confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Jews and drove them out of the lands governed by himself directly \"[2](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/jewish/1182-jewsfrance1.asp). The reason for so is that Philp need funds to defeat the various barons who challenged him. In order to do so, he \"he annulled all loans made to Christians by Jews, taking instead a comfortable twenty per cent for himself\". He also believed in Jewish Blood Libel, the idea that Jewish people kidnap Christian children in order to sacrifice them.\n\n&gt; [Philip Augustus had often heard] that the Jews who dwelt in Paris were wont every year on Easter day, or during the sacred week of our Lord's Passion, to go down secretly into underground vaults and kill a Christian as a sort of sacrifice in contempt of the Christian religion. For a long time they had persisted in this wickedness, inspired by the devil, and in Philip's father's time, many of them had been seized and burned with fire. St. Richard, whose body rests in the church of the Holy Innocents-in-the-Fields in Paris, was thus put to death and crucified by the Jews, and through martyrdom went in blessedness to God. [Louis VII, then king, held the Jews guiltless in this death.] Wherefore many miracles have been wrought by the hand of God through the prayers and intercessions of St. Richard, to the glory of God, as we have heard.\n\nIn 1198 he allowed the Jews to return.\n\n&gt; 1276 - Upper Bavaria - Expelled \n\nIn 1276, 180 Jews were burnt at the stake following a Blood libel claim. These people seem to be confusing **literally being murdered** to simply \"being expelled\".\n\n&gt;  1290 - England - Expelled  \n\nThis is true, around 16,000 Jews were expelled by Edward I for not giving him loans\n\n&gt; To help finance his war to conquer Wales, Edward I taxed the Jewish moneylenders. However, the cost of Edward's ambitions soon drained the money-lenders dry. When the Jews could no longer pay, the state accused them of disloyalty, and later forced them to relocate.\n\nI don't see how exactly \"Jewish behaviour\" had anything to do wit this, considering all they did was refuse to pay Edward again after he had taken a large chunk of their wealth\n\n&gt; 1306 - France - Expelled \n\nYes, this happened, in 1306 Philip IV of France (or more ironically, Philip the \"Fair\"), banished all his Jewish subjects and confiscated their lands, goods, and property.\n\nThe reason for so was that he saw Jews as a giant piggy bank, as \" he intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury\".\n\nI don't see why exactly Jews are actually being blamed for someone stealing from them.\n\n&gt; 1322 - France - Expelled\n\nYes, this happened. In 1322 all the Jews in France were expelled. Why? The year before was known as the [great leper scare](\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1321_leper_scare) in which Jews were accused of poisoning Christian wells. 5,000 jews were killed for this, Oh and the king [Philip V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_France#The_.22leper_scare.22) quite literally admitted that the Jews were innocent. So much for \"bad Jewish behaviour\" here.\n\n&gt; 1348 - Switerland -Expelled\n\nThe Jews weren't expelled here. They were massacred. In reaction to the Black Plague, six hundred Jews and the town Rabbis were burned at the stake, 140 children were forcibly baptized, The victims were left unburied, the cemetery destroyed and the synagogue turned into a church. The remaining Jews not allowed to return until 1869.\n\nUnless \"Jewish behaviour\" results in the Black Death, I still don't see how it's their fault.\n\n&gt; \n                        1349 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hungary\n                        1360 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hungary\n                        1370 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Belgium\n                        1380 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Slovakia\n                        1388 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Strasbourg\n                        1394 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Germany\n                        1394 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - France\n\nMore Black Death shenanigans.\n\n&gt; 1398 - Czechoslovakia - expelled\n\nNo, once again, they were **massacred** here. Not \"expelled\". The only things that were \"expelled\" here were the Jewish souls headed on to the afterlife.\n\nAnd the horrid \"Jewish behaviour\" responsible for such a repercussion? \n\nA group of Jewish boys were playing with a ball of sand, one of them accidentally hit a priest. The priest, feeling offended, insisted that the Jewish was community purposely plotting against him. Roughly 3,000 Jews were killed for this. [Duke Wenceslaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia) stated that \"that the responsibility rested with the Jews for venturing outside during Holy Week.\"\n\n**I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.**\n\n\n&gt; 1420 - Lysons - Expelled\n\nWell, according to [this](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10212-lyons) an edict by Charles VI in 1394 stated that all Jewish people must leave the city.\n\nWhy? If my source is correct:\n\n&gt; From this time until the middle of the eighteenth century Jews were not allowed to live in Lyons. Two documents, dated respectively 1548 and 1571, show that their presence was at these dates considered a scandal to the city and the Christian religion.\n\nSome of you with eagle eyes will point out: \"Hey, Charles decreed the expulsion in 1394, but the date given is 1420!\"\n\nFear not my fine eyed friends! Tis' not a typo, seems that no one actually enforced Charles IV's declaration until nearly three decades later \n\n&gt; 1421 - Austria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1424 - Freibourg - Expelled \n\nAgain, Most likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1424 - Zurich - Expelled \n\n[For the third time, most likely didn't happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PbdJiAK84)\n\n&gt; 1424 - Cologne - Expelled\n\nThis could be referring to the [the expulsion in 1426](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4550-cologne#anchor7), but nothing in two years earlier.\n\n&gt; 1432 - Saxony - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happpen\n\n&gt; 1438 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1439 - Austria - Expelled\n\nYes, this did happen. [Albert II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II_of_Germany) who had [a long previous history of anti-semitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II_of_Germany#Expulsion_of_the_Jews).\n\nIn 1439 he accepted 900 *gulden* from the city of Ausenborg in exchange for permission to expel their Jewish residents. He agreed.\n\nOh, and his moniker was Albert the **Magnanimous**. What is with Medieval kings and ironic nicknames?\n\nAs for why exactly, I couldn't find much. But to make up for that, here's [Albert's face](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Albrecht_II._von_Habsburg.jpg/200px-Albrecht_II._von_Habsburg.jpg) beside an image of [Spoderman](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/286/500/2d0.jpg).\n\nCoincidence? \n\nI think not!\n\n&gt; 1442 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nI think this *might* be referring to Pope Eugenius IV putting out an edict which prevented Jewish people from: building synagogues, holding public office, testifying against Christians, among other things.\n\nThey weren't actually expelled here, they just chose to leave to other parts of Italy instead.\n\nIf it's not talking about the above, then it most likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 1444 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nIn 1444 a city named Utrecht in the Netherlands passed legislation which stated \"Jews to be imprisoned, tortured, killed, and expelled\".\n\nThe reason for such is not known exactly, but it is believed that the justification was a from bishop named Wolravus of Meurs who claimed Jews would \"privately criticise Christianity\".\n\nThe expulsion was later repealed and they were allowed to return.\n\n&gt; 1446 - Bavaria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1453 - Franconis - Expelled\n\nWTF is a Franconis? The place doesn't exist, let alone the incident.\n\n&gt; 1454 - Würzburg - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1462 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nIn *Italy* (read: Not Germany) Jews were expelled, because they lost business from competition from Franciscans.\n\nJews perform poorly at the market? What a bunch of lazy freeloaders! EXPEL THEM\n\nJews become wealthy? They must be all-powerful and out to ruin society. EXPEL THEM\n\n&gt; 1483 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nThe only non-J00zsareouttogetus claim I could find of this incident is a one line reference in [this book](https://books.google.ca/books?id=WDnbzk4-BmkC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=1483+mainz+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Imm76e1zsl&amp;sig=ko8i0YF5LlkxBrH-utRTnzYUrro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO8JekmL7WAhVs4oMKHQH6AFQQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1483%20mainz%20jews&amp;f=false) that's discussing Black death expulsions.\n\n&gt; 1484 - Warsaw - Expelled\n\nGot nuthin' here\n\n&gt; 1485 - Italy - Expelled\n\nRead above line.\n\n&gt; 1492 - Spain - Expelled\n&gt; 1492 - Italy - Expelled\n\nWait... what?\n\nAre these people really using 1492 as an example of \"horrible Jewish behaviour\"???\n\nLet's see what happened in [1492](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1492)\n\n1) [Jewish people being scheming, insidious etc. and totally deserving of this hate targeted at them and **only them, specifically**](https://developers.oxwall.com/ow_userfiles/plugins/base/11046-Page%20not%20found%2015-12-2016%2011.17.02.png)\n\nOR\n\n2) [Something else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista)\n\n&gt; 1495 - Lithuania - Expelled\n\nYep, the Friar, John of Capistrano personally instigated anti-Jewish riots. \n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; Though his main aim was to instigate a popular rebellion against the Hussites, he also carried out a ruthless campaign against the Jews whom he accused of profaning the Christian religion. As a result of Capistrano's endeavours, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Shortly after, John of Capistrano, invited to Poland by Zbigniew Olesnicki, conducted a similar campaign in Krakow and several other cities where, however, anti-Jewish unrest took on a much less acute form. Forty years later, in 1495, Jews were ordered out of the centre of Krakow and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the example of Spanish rulers, banished the Jews from Lithuania. For several years they took shelter in Poland until they were allowed back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1503.\n\nI think it's alright if I take a pass on blaming (((the jews))) for being scapegoated by Christians... to wage wars on other Christians.\n\n&gt; 1496 - Naples - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1498 - Numberg - Expelled\n\nIt's possible this did happen, but the incident was in 1499, not 1498.\n\nThe reason why is unknown.\n\n&gt; 1510 - Brandenburg - Expelled\n\nFor the utmost time, this wasn't an \"expulsion\". ~50 Jews were burnt at stake for blasphemy.\n\n&gt; 1510 - Prussia - Expelled\n\nYes, the Jews here were accused of [Host desecration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_desecration) and expelled.\n\n&gt; 1514 - Strasbourg - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1515 - Genoa - Expelled\n\nYep. This did happen, though they were [readmitted a year later](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/genoa)\n\n&gt; 1519 - Rensegurburg - Expelled\n\n[Gee, I wonder why?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism)\n\n&gt; 1533 - Naples - Expelled\n&gt; 1541 - Naples - Expelled\n\nActually they weren't expelled here. The invading Spaniards forced any Jewish person who couldn't pay 300 ducanti a year to leave.\n\nIn later years (ie 1541) they raised the price, so the entire Jewish community got up and left.\n\n&gt; 1542 - Bohemia and Prague - Expelled \n\nMost likely never happened\n\n&gt; 1547 - Russia - Expelled\n\nYeah, you see here, this was a result of a unruly young chap literally (and quite aptly) named [Ivan the **Terrible**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible) saying \"Jews bring about great evil\".\n\nAt least the Medieval nickname-givers were getting better at their job I see.\n\n&gt; 1550 - Genoa - Expelled\n\nUmm... in 1550 Genoa expelled *a Jew*. As in, one person. That being [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ha-Kohen) for practising medicine when it was supposed to be a \"Christian only\" occupation, which was a tad bit unfortunate seeing that [Christian doctors were known for refusing to treat Jewish patients]\n\n&gt; 1551 - Bavaria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 1555 - Pesaro - Expelled\n\nRead above line\n\n&gt; 1561 - Prague - Expelled\n\nRead the above line, again.\n\n&gt; 1569 - Papal States - Expelled\n\nYep. Pope Pius V expelled all Jews outside of Ancona and Rome. \n\nHe also burned tens of thousands of Talmuds :(\n\n&gt; 1571 - Venice - Expelled\n\nThe Venetian government, at war with Turkey, resolves to expel all Jews from Venice and the Adriatic Islands. Though the expulsion is not enforced, it reflects the impact of the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation) and the papal willingness to sacrifice local commercial interests to doctrinal necessities.\n\n&gt; 1582 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nI wouldn't blame the Netherlands here, as they were actually tolerant of Jews (compared to other Christian states).\n\nThe reason they were \"expelled\" here at all had nothing to do with Holland, but actually Spain when Charles V invaded and took over the territory where Jewish people resided.\n\n&gt; 1593 - Austria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1597 - Milan - Expelled\n\nYep, around 900 Jews were forced out of Milan after Spain conquered the city.\n\n&gt; 1597 - Cremonia, Pavia, and Lodi - Expelled\n\nWhy did he lump all of these together?\n\nGoogling all three gives me nothing, and googling them one by one has the same result.\n\nIf you're was going to make up three separate incidents, you might as well put them in three separate places\n\nI'll just go with \"All three probably never happened\".\n\n&gt; 1614 - Frankfurt - Expelled\n\nYes, this happened. In 1614 an interesting young individual named [Vincenz Fettmilch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenz_Fettmilch) who previously worked as a grocer and gingerbread baker, decided to get his [genocide gloves on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse#The_Fettmilch_Rising) from 1612 to 1614. In one attack on a Jewish city (Judengasse) him and his merry mob men sacked the town's 1,300 Jews and forced them to leave.\n\nHe also called himself the \"new Haman of the Jews\". Yes, he was talking about [that Hamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman)\n\n\n&gt; 1615 - Worms - Expelled\n\nA guild \"non-violently\" expelled the city's Jews.\n\nFrom the [Haaretz article](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.715272)\n\n&gt; On this day, April 20, 1615, the Jews of Worms were persuaded that it was in their interest to leave the city without delay. While the local citizenry took pride in employing non-violent means after having abused their Jewish neighbors for centuries, arguably the means used to get them to go, which included starvation and threats of expulsion, were not quite benign. \n\n&gt; 1619 - Keiv - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1648 - Ukraine - Expelled\n\nWHAT?\n\nThey're talking about ***Chmielnicki massacre*** \n\n**You know, the one where Ukrainian Cossacks killed anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people and is considered the worst massacre in Jewish history Pre-Holocaust?**\n\n&gt; 1656 - Lithuania - Expelled\n\nMost likely never happed\n\n&gt; 1669 - Oran (North Africa) - Expelled\n\nI've never actually heard of a Jewish expulsion in North Africa pre-1900s.\n\nAs with Carthage, googling this give me nothing so I'm assuming it never happened.\n\n&gt; 1669 - Vienna - Expelled\n\nYes, the Holy Roman Empire did begin a round of expulsions in 1669 but Emperor Leopold I called them back later the same year\n\n&gt; 1712 - Sandomir - Expelled\n\nJews expelled from Sandomir, following blood libel claims\n\n&gt; 1727 - Russia - Expelled\n\nWell this one was difficult to pin down, but it turns out that in 1727 [Catherine I](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catherine_I_of_Russia) ordered all Jews expelled from Russia, although to what extent the order is implemented is unclear.\n\nThere is [actually evidence of Jewish life in Russia throughout the 1720's and 1730's](https://books.google.ca/books?id=vL60sEf7OPoC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=1727+Jews+expelled+russia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=woWDzOIVa6&amp;sig=aaYQvb_XCUqvsWtdrFvXAVgnaow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBrd2_yL7WAhVNzGMKHVfiDfYQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1727%20Jews%20expelled%20russia&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt; 1738 - Württemberg - Expelled\n\nActually no Jews were \"expelled\" here, although one Jewish person was hanged. The full story of this revolves around a Catholic Duke by the name of [Karl Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Alexander,_Duke_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg) and his [court Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew) Joseph Süß Oppenheimer. \n\nAs a financial advisor for Duke Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, he also gained a prominent position as a court Jew and held the reins of the finances in his duchy. He established a duchy monopoly on the trade of salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory. Being both Jewish and successful, he evidently made a boatload of enemies, but had the protection of Alexander. When Karl Alexander died suddenly in 1737, Oppenheimer was arrested and accused of various things, including fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies, accepting bribes, and trying to \"reestablish\" Catholicism. Oppenheimer was hanged in 1738.\n\nIronically, Oppenheimer **was** given to option to convert to Christianity and you know, *not* die, but he refused. The irony comes from the fact that they blamed him for spreading Catholicism, as if a religious Jew would try to get people to become Catholic.\n\nOppenheimer was actually used in [Nazi propaganda]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jud_S%C3%BC%C3%9F_(1940_film)\n\nBut no expulsion here.\n\n&gt; 1744 - Prague - Expelled\n\nIn 1744 Archduchess Maria Theresa orders: \"... no Jew is to be tolerated in our inherited duchy of Bohemia\".\n\nA handful of years later, she reverses her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. This extortion was known as malke-geld (queen's money).\n\n&gt; 1761 - Bordeaux - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1772 - Russia - Expulsion\n\nThis has to to do with the [Catherine II](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catherine_the_Great). Like the first one, she apparently didn't like Jews all too much, as she created the [Pale Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement)\n\nAs to why, it had to do with [The First Partition of Poland](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/First_Partition_of_Poland) in 1722, before that Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a \"Jew\" is, since the term meant many things during her reign. Judaism was a small religion in Russia until the year of the partition. To make a new problem small as quickly as she could, she created a ghetto to keep Jewish people in.\n\nThis probably wasn't an \"expulsion\" as these people are thinking it is, as the Jews were still technically in the Russian Empire\n\n&gt; 1775 - Warsaw - Expelled\n\nNope. No expulsion here. in 1775 a group of soldiers invaded a Jewish suburb and ransacked the wealth found there, and demolished all the Jewish houses and synagogues. They then took the items they looted and sold them at auction.\n\nIf you seriously think this was a result of \"Jewish behaviour\" or \"it's the Jew's fault\" you're just victim blaming at this point.\n\n&gt; 1789 - Alsace - Expelled\n\nNot exactly an expulsion, in the years prior to 1789 anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish people were being blamed for rising tensions and the French revolution.  Later in 1789, speaking in a debate on the eligibility of Jews for citizenship, the Count of Clermont-Tonnerre had this to say:\n\n&gt; \"The Jews,\" he said, \"should be denied everything as a nation, but granted everything as individuals.\" \"It is intolerable,\" he continued, \"that the Jews should become a separate political formation or class within the country. Every one of them must individually become a citizen; if they do not want this, they must inform us and we shall then be compelled to expel them.\"[3](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1997/11/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity)\n\nUnless you can manage to convince me that the literal *French Revolution* was \"Jewish behaviour\", Imma skip on blaming Jews for this one.\n\n&gt; 1804 - Villages in Russia - Expelled\n&gt; 1808 - Villages and the Russian countryside - Expelled\n\nI've found no confirmation of these, but I don't doubt. In the 19th century Russia was largely becoming more and more secularised, to the dismay of the more religious country folk. In order to come to grips with rapidly advancing times, village leaders would blame the Jewish minority and organise pogroms aimed at them.\n\n&gt;  1815 LeBeck and Bremen - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1815 - Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria - Expelled \n\nWhy have all three as separate entities? Both Franconia and Swabia are regions *in* Bavaria.\n\nMost likely never happened.\n\n&gt; 1820 - Bremen - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1843 - Russian Border, Austria, Prussia - Expelled\n\nWhat is it with this guy and lumping multiple \"expulsions\" together?\n\nIt's almost like... they never happened?\n\n&gt; 1862 - United States - Expelled\n\nAhhh, they're talking [General Grant's General Order Number 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._11_(1862).\n\nWhat happened here was G. Grant put out an issue that declared the removal of all Jews in his military jurisdiction, which included parts of Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The official reason as to why was officially claimed by Grant to \"cut down on the black market prevalent in the Union, especially the sale of unregistered cotton by Jews\".\n\nThe bill was never actually passed however, as Abraham Lincoln himself revoked the order. It's interesting to note that in the years that followed Grant became the American President and seemed to abandon his previous feelings of Jews, as well as developed a thing for them. He raised awareness of anti-Jewish atrocities going on in Europe, took back his previous statements of the draft asserting it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading, in the press of warfare, and became the first American President to visit a synagogue.\n\nIn other words, no \"expulsion took place\".\n\n&gt; 1866 - Galatz - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1880s - Russia - Expelled\n\nRead above entry for expulsions for Russian villages, but imagine it 1,000 times more intense, occasionally within cities, and with less justification. \n\nAlso why did they suddenly decide to lump the entire decade together?\n\n&gt; 1891 - Moscow - Expelled\n\nAn imperial decree was promulgated (March 28, 1891) ordering the expulsion from the city and government of Moscow of all Jewish artisans, brewers, and distillers. As to why only artists, brewers, and distillers, I have no idea, but it might have had to do with [our magic vegetable](https://books.google.ca/books?id=R4tStGjCAPgC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W72JBTv98t&amp;sig=_otzRqhZYpA2ju-0Mos49Q4PNGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt; 1938-45 - Germany - Expelled\n\n[Hmmm](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Thinking_Face_Emoji_grande.png?v=1480481060)\n\n[Guys what can they be talking about](https://media.giphy.com/media/CaiVJuZGvR8HK/giphy.gif)\n\n[No seriously people I have no idea what this could be referring to](https://media1.giphy.com/media/xUPGcz2H1TXdCz4suY/200.webp#3-grid1)\n\n~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~\n\nAnd that's it folks!\n\nHere are various other reasons why Jewish people were persecuted throughout history:\n\n\n   *  They were foreigners with no formal citizenship anywhere in their\n                diaspora.\n   *  They were scattered throughout the world, never concentrated\n                in a single area.\n   *  Historically, Jewish relations tended to be more solitary\n   *  In Medieval Europe, Jews were literally the only non-Christian minority, so when things got iffy (hint hint Black \n                Death) there was only one minority to blame.

[:P](https://media.giphy.com/media/FRkhhXNtXlbb2/giphy.gif))\n\n**A bit of background!**\n\nThere's this chain of vegan restaurants run by a cult. It's called the Loving Hut, and I love them so very much. They have TVs that display the Supreme Leader talking. And they have [this poster](https://i.imgur.com/dML9Yme.jpg). It's beautiful, magnificent, even. Now, I'm all for making veganism more mainstream and showing that it's not just crazy people and preteen girls who are vegan. The trouble is that this particular poster sacrifices historical accuracy to make its point. \n\nI'll break down each figure individually, but to really understand why this poster is wrong, it's important to understand at least a bit of the history of veganism. \n\nVeganism is the rejection of all animal products, particularly when eating. No meat, no milk, no eggs, you get the idea. It's an off-shoot of vegetarianism. Vegetarianism has existed for quite a long time, but veganism is a bit sketchier. There have certainly been people advocating for a cessation of all animal-based products, but much like the use of the term \"homosexual\" to describe someone living before our current understanding of sexuality, it would be problematic to call these advocates \"vegans.\" This is especially true, given that the modern philosophy of veganism tends to include both the practical aspect of not using animal products as well as the ethical stance of believing that it is wrong to use animals and/or that animals are equal beings. It's the combination of these two things that make it difficult, if not impossible, to say there were historical vegans.\n\nHowever, it's still worth pointing out that we have evidence that there were people practicing what might be considered veganism well before the 20th century. Al-Ma'arri, for instance, was a 10th century Arab poet (and frankly fascinating guy) who wrote [both about the cessation from consuming animal products and the ethical reasons behind doing so](http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm). What's interesting about his poetry is both that he is arguing that people should not be stealing eggs or drinking milk, but also that the basis for this reasoning is that people *might* be causing animals pain by doing so. This *might* is fascinating, both because it means the idea of animals as beings that could feel equivalent pain existed in the 10th century, but also that Al-Ma'arri, as much as he was being a strong advocate for their rights wasn't sure whether or not what he was saying had any grounding. It's also important to note that we do know Al-Ma'arri refrained from animal products because he specifically wrote that he did in a letter:\n\n&gt; Another reason that induced me to abstain from animal food is the fact that my income is a little over 20 dinars a year and when my servant takes out of that as much as he wants, no magnificent sum is left so I restrict myself to beans and lentils, and such food as I would rather not mention.\n\nAs I said, Al-Ma'arri is an amazing guy. I highly recommend reading up on him. \n\nHe does make the problem of labeling historical vegans as vegans clear, though. There must be some incorporation of the philosophy of animal equality combined with the diet to make a vegan. There also has to be some recognition of milk, eggs, and honey as products coming from animals. That combination didn't come into existence until the 19th century. Depending on how you define \"vegan,\" there is evidence of vegans forming a [society in the UK in 1843](https://ivu.org/history/societies/britfor.html), but this once again falls into the awkward defining of \"vegan\" in historical terms, so I'm going to exclude it. What is important about that general time period, though, is that in 1847, the Vegetarian Society was formed, also in the UK. It's from the Vegetarian Society that we get some of the clearest history of veganism.\n\nBy 1884, we have [references to divisions within the Vegetarian Society](https://books.google.com/books?id=2rdXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA712#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) between people who want to eschew all animal products, and people who are just vegetarians. They don't get along with each other, and by 1910, the debate intensifies with the publication of \"No Animal Food\" by Rupert H. Wheldon. \n\n\"No Animal Food\" is an unquestionably vegan cookbook. It's got tons of recipes, none involving animal ingredients. The fact that it was published at all shows there was a market for it, even if the actual practicality of the diet remained questionable. Still, that the book exists at all is good evidence that there were vegans in the early 20th century, and that they were recognisably vegans, even by today's definitions. Even if the term \"vegan\" wasn't coined until 1944, there still were unquestionably vegans before then. However, the movement certainly had more visibility after the formation of its own society and its own term in 1944.\n\nI don't want to go off on too much of a tangent about why veganism was able to survive and even thrive in 20th century Britain here (though I'll put links in the sources), but my point is that, making claims that anyone was vegan before the mid-19th century is sketchy at best, due to both the lack of the ethical side, and due to sheer practicality. This doesn't mean there *weren't* people who refrained from eating animal food (like our good buddy Al-Ma'arri), just that calling them \"vegans\" likely isn't historically accurate.\n\nWhich brings me back to that poster. I'm going to focus on the four historical figures there, because there are actually interesting arguments for each of them being vegan. By our definitions that we've established here, the only one who could be considered \"vegan\" by modern standards is Albert Einstein, but I think it's well-worth taking a look at each of them anyway, just to get an idea of the arguments around them and how we evaluate historical diets and ethics[.](https://media.giphy.com/media/CP1AxXkLuUdFu/giphy.gif) \n\n**Leonardo da Vinci**\n\n[This page from PETA](https://www.peta.org/living/other/vegetarians-already-admire/) has the quote that is usually attributed to da Vinci as evidence of his veganism, namely:\n\n&gt; I have from an early age abjured the use of meat, and the time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men.\n\nYou can see why it would be a popular one. This is not something Leonardo da Vinci ever said. It's actually from a Russian novel written in 1928. What he *did* say, though, can be seen in the *Quaderni d'Anatomia*:\n\n&gt;  If you are as you have described yourself the king of the animals –– it would be better for you to call yourself king of the beasts since you are the greatest of them all! –– why do you not help them so that they may presently be able to give you their young in order to gratify your palate, for the sake of which you have tried to make yourself a tomb for all the animals? Even more I might say if to speak the entire truth were permitted me.\n\nThis quote and \n\n&gt; \"Certain infidels called Guzzarati are so gentle that they do not feed on anything which has blood, nor will they allow anyone to hurt any living thing, like our Leonardo da Vinci.\"\n\nare the ones usually cited to make the argument that da Vinci was vegan. The problem is that these quotes are not enough. They don't say anything about da Vinci's actual behaviour, which is vital for establishing veganism. \n\nDon't get me wrong: Leonardo da Vinci is a fascinating person, and his views on animals and the treatment of animals are definitely different from what you find in most people of his time. Certainly quotes about him like the one above and the stories from Vasari about [him releasing birds from the marketplace](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/nov/30/leonardo-da-vinci-animal-rights-activist) suggest that he had a bit of a soft spot when it came to animals. However, the problem is that saying \"animals are cool too\" and actually refraining from eating them and the things they make are entirely different propositions. As the debates about the real beginnings of veganism show, the actual practical aspect of veganism remains problematic for quite some time historically. \n\nCouple this with the fact that da Vinci's shopping lists absolutely included meat, milk, and honey, and you run into what I like to call the \"but what will you eat\" problem. Quite simply, when living in 15th century Italy, there are limited vegan options, and ethics have to take a backseat to not starving. Even beyond that, saying that animals are thinking beings does not necessarily lead to actually treating them as such. It's possible to believe something without acting on it, or to have beliefs misinterpreted by later audiences.\n\nBeing generous, it's *possible* da Vinci was a vegetarian. There is no evidence whatsoever that he was a vegan, even setting aside the fact that vegans as we understand them wouldn't exist until the 19th century.\n\n**Pythagoras**\n\nAsking if Pythagoras was a vegan is similar to asking if Homer was vegan. We have nothing written by the man himself, and only later (somewhat unreliable) sources to tell us much about him. As an example, one of our major resources for piecing together the life of Pythagoras is Aristotle, who talks about Pythagoras as a mythical figure who hated beans, had a golden thigh, and bit a snake to death. You can see the problem with trying to put together a dinner menu for Pythagoras based on this resource. Even the Pythagoreans who purportedly followed Pythagoras' teachings didn't always seem to agree on what those teachings were, as Aristotle also noted. The philosophers who were most heavily influenced by Pythagoreanism as well also have such a widely diverse set of ideas that it's hard to tell what is and is not Pythagoras. \n\nThere are a few things that are clear about Pythagorean beliefs that are relevant to this post, and it's likely that these beliefs did come from Pythagoras. The first is the transmigration of souls, and the idea that souls migrate from body to body. I really don't want to go too deep into Pythagorean philosophy here, but suffice to say that this belief lends itself to the interpretation that Pythagoreans believed human souls could go into animals, and that Pythagoras was a vegetarian because of this. \n\nThe trouble is that the sources we have don't agree on this. On the one hand, Eudoxus says \"he not only abstained from animal food but would also not come near butchers and hunters,\" while Aristotle claims \"the Pythagoreans refrain from eating the womb and the heart, the sea anemone and some other such things but use all other animal food.\" Indeed, we have more evidence that Pythagoras ate meat based on the fact that Iamblichus recorded him as holding that sacrifice was just, and sacrifice in ancient Greece necessitated killing animals.\n\nThe sheer fact that there are so many differing ideas of how to be a Pythagorean, even in 4th century Greece makes it impossible to make any real statement about Pythagoras' ethical or dietary beliefs. We have no sources from Pythagoras himself, and the philosophers that followed him have such differing beliefs that it's hard to say what, if anything, is true. However, it's highly, highly unlikely that a man living in 4th century Greece who participated in Ancient Greek religious rituals could be considered vegan by today's standards. \n\nAlso, amusingly, Aristotle says he was scared of beans. This also tends not to describe today's vegans.\n\n**Laozi**\n\nThe picture labels him as Lao Tzu, but Laozi seems to be the more common transliteration. Also, are you ready for your crash course on Taoism? Because you're getting a crash course on Taoism.\n\nPart of the challenge of refuting this poster is figuring out the argument that's being made for why a particular person is said to be vegan. Leonardo was easy, Pythagoras was harder, and Laozi...let's just say that it's been half an hour, and I think I understand the argument, but I'm not quite sure. I'll take a crack at what I think the argument here is. \n\nTo understand the argument that Laozi was a vegan, you have to understand Taoism. To understand Taoism takes more space than I have here, so let me try to summarise. Taoism centres around the idea of the Tao, which roughly translates as \"the Way,\" or the flow of the universe. The goal is to be in tandem with this flow of the universe through wu wei, or non-action, or not taking actions that run contrary to the flow of the universe. All living beings are part of the tao and are cultivating their own place within it. One interpretation of how to live in accordance with the Tao, then, is to not bring harm to other living beings, since doing so is action and contrary to what you yourself should be doing. If one is not meant to harm other living beings and eating those beings logically brings them harm, the only way to be a good Taoist is to be a vegan. Since Laozi is the founder of Taoism, and therefore the source of its ideas, he must therefore have practiced his own teachings and been a vegan.\n\nI think that's the argument. If someone is more familiar with Taoism or the argument that Laozi was a vegan, please feel free to correct me.\n\nThere are many problems with the argument that Laozi was a vegan, not the least of which is the fact that Laozi might not have been a real person. If you'll indulge me, I'll go on a bit of a tangent to go into one of my favourite parts of religious studies - textual analysis and authentication of texts.\n\nOne reason we're not sure whether or not Laozi was a real person is because of how hard it is to date the *Laozi* and verify him. None of his contemporaries - like Confucius - mention him, and the earliest biography we have of him comes from a historian named Sima Qian writing 400 years after his death. This forces us to turn to the text to date it, which is difficult at best. Scholars use both the text itself and the things it references to date a text, as I've [discussed in another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6mjklg/lets_go_up_to_the_caldera_to_pray_or_how_to_use/), and the *Laozi* is no different. Scholars compare the oldest versions we have to the modern version to see how much and what has changed, and date based on that. The problem is that even analysis of the text gives contradictory results. For instance, analysing the rhyme scheme gives you a date either of the 5th century or the 4th century, depending on how you interpret the ancient Chinese. Records found in tombs confirm it has to be from at least the 2nd century BCE, but that doesn't answer the question of authorship. Other authors argue that consistency of vocabulary suggests a single author rather than a group, while others say it's entirely possible to have that consistency with a tight school of thought, as we sometimes see with the Pauline Epistles. \n\nQuite simply, there probably was some influential figure who is the source of Taoism, but what he did or did not write and when he did or did not write it, we're not sure. You see how it might be a problem to claim Laozi as a vegan, though, since he might not have existed in the first place. \n\nLet's assume, though, that he did exist. The problem with the argument that's made for Laozi being a vegan isn't necessarily a historical one, but does reflect a failing in how we interpret history and religion. We assume that because a reading can be found in the text, it must have been one the author intended. You find this failing over and over again. One of my favourite examples of this is from Genesis 1:28, the bit where God gives man dominion over the Earth to \"subdue\" it. It's a really controversial translation, but depending on how you want to interpret authorial intent, the translation and the meaning of the sentence can completely change (the most common translation being \"subdue\" vs. \"reign\"), as can how the text is used. \n\nTaoism is no different. There are definitely interpretations of Taoism that support both vegetarianism and veganism, but these interpretations do not mean that they are what the author originally intended, or that the author would have any recognition of what it is that's being found in their text. Indeed, vegetarianism in China more generally only seems to have taken hold with the introduction of Buddhism, and even then, it's not widespread. It's unlikely Laozi would have recognised vegetarianism as a viable interpretation of his philosophy, let alone veganism. Even though these interpretations can be found in the text, that the author originally intended them is another question entirely.\n\nWhich brings me to the only person on this list who could fall under the definition of vegan...\n\n**Albert Einstein**\n\nEinstein was not a vegan. I'm really hard-pressed to figure out why he's on the poster (and why he's not on the \"beautiful\" section of it). He has several lovely quotes in support of vegetarianism, such as: \n\n&gt; So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.\n\n&gt; I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience.\n\nand \n\n&gt; Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\n\nBut you see the problem with all of these. The first quote is from a letter written in 1954, and the second from 1953. Einstein died in 1955. In at least 1953, he was still eating meat, and was only giving vegetarianism a shot in 1954. None of it supports that he was a vegan, and once again, just saying \"animals are cool\" does not make one a vegan. Much like da Vinci, though, I would not take a lack of veganism as an indication that a person didn't care about animals, but rather than definitions and historical accuracy matter, and historically speaking, Einstein was in no way a vegan.\n\n**Sources!**\n\n[The BBC has a nice article all about Al-Ma'arri](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35745962)\n\n[\"No Animal Food\" by Rupert H. Wheldon](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22829/22829-h/22829-h.htm). I HIGHLY recommend skipping to the ads for other books that are included in this book. It has nothing to do with veganism, but the ads are such a great look at early 20th century middle class Britain that they really are amazing.\n\n[\"No Animal Food: The road to veganism in Britain, 1909-1944\" by Leah Leneman](https://ivu.org/history/vegan-from-1909.pdf). I didn't really go into it in the post proper, but I highly recommend this article, both if you're interested in why the early 20th century was a flashpoint for discussions of animal rights, and to see how the arguments for and against veganism really haven't changed much in the last century. It's a really interesting piece.\n\n[Bit of history about the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence of Animal Food, one of the earliest proto-vegan societies](https://ivu.org/history/societies/britfor.html)\n\n[Interesting essay about da Vinci and his views on animals](https://ivu.org/history/davinci/hurwitz.html)\n\n[The SEP entry on Pythagoras](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/)\n\nAlso, my class notes from an Ancient Philosophy class I took in 2013 during which I only worked on crossword puzzles part of the time, and definitely remember the name \"Pythagoras\" coming up at least twice\n\n[The Life of Pythagoras by Iamblichus](https://archive.org/details/lifeofpythagoras00iamb)\n\n[Do_not_eat_beans.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism#/media/File:Do_Not_Eat_Beans.jpg)\n\n\"Did Daoism Have a Founder?

        "text": "I was on Youtube and as I getting ready to watch a video - an advertisement for Prager University which is a non-profit conservative digital media organization, which apparently is not an academic institution and does not offer certifications or diplomas, showed up to my confusion. This was my introduction to them and it's already created a bad first impression. I have to admit I was immediately bias upon seeing the speaker Dinesh D'Souza as he began to spout that multiculturalism supports the idea that \"the United States and Western Europe are made up of imperialist, colonialist, resource-exploiting, greedy, grasping, brown-skin-hating people whose values are not worth defending.\" - But that's not what caught my eye; I believe the whole video is a goldmine of badhistory, but I don't have the extensive knowledge to denounce most of it - so, I picked a part that was easy to call out as misinformation.\n\n&gt;*\"As for slavery, it has existed in every culture. It was prevalent in ancient China, in ancient India, in Greece and Rome, and in Africa. American Indians practiced slavery long before Columbus set foot here.*\n\n&gt;*What is uniquely Western, in fact, is not slavery, but the abolition of slavery. And what distinguishes the West from all other cultures are the institutions of democracy, capitalism, and science. These institutions developed because of a peculiar dynamism of Athens and Jerusalem––a synthesis of classical reason and Judeo-Christian morality....\" - [Dinesh D'Souza, Presentation for Prager University.](https://www.prageru.com/courses/political-science/are-some-cultures-better-others)* [Link to Video and Transcript]\n\nHowever after some minor research into the topic and partially reading the first Volume of the Encyclopedia of Antislavery and Abolition, it's easily discovered that *\"In 17 C.E. during the \"Red Eyebrow rebellion,\" the chief minister Wang Mang usurped the throne and instituted a series of sweeping reforms including the abolition of slavery...\"[(Hinks McKivigan 155)](http://1.droppdf.com/files/n5gmT/encyclopedia-of-antislavery.pdf)*[PDF of the Encyclopedia] and while that didn't last for long, a later emperor  by name of T'ai Tsu abolished all forms of slavery. Slavery in China, however, continued on despite imperial decree. \n\nAnd I can't claim that I know of any other non-\"Western\" civilizations or cultures, but both these examples predate the abolishment of slavery in the West with exception of Athens and the Republic of Rome abolishing debt slavery.\n\nStill D'Souza I believe is saying the reason Western Civilization thought of Abolitionism is because it's roots in democracy, capitalism, and science which were only able to be develop because of classical Greek philosophy and Judeo-Christian morality? I don't claim to know much on all of those topics history and interconnectedness, but I doubt the role those ideals played in the long struggle to abolish slavery.\n\nAny corrections or feedback is welcomed since this is my first post on the subreddit.",

Lincoln initially supported a Constitutional amendment **protecting** slavery in order to ensure the continuation of the the Union and calm secessionist tensions, as many anti-Lincoln fanatics will quickly tell you. Here's an explanation of the original 13th amendment: \n\n\n&gt;But the 13th Amendment we know now differs substantially from the one first proposed. The initial amendment would have made slavery constitutional and permanent — and Lincoln supported it. This early version of the 13th Amendment, known as the Corwin Amendment, was proposed in December 1860 by William Seward, a senator from New York who would later join Lincoln’s cabinet as his first secretary of state.The Corwin Amendment read as follows: No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.\n\nSource: http://cognoscenti.legacy.wbur.org/2013/02/18/the-other-13th-richard-albert\n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nhttps://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/last-chance-for-compromise/\n\n\nAlso the institution of slavery predates any political party so it's a bit silly to pin it on one party to begin with. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the Democratic Party was around during the colonial era of British rule, the Articles of Confederation period, or the when the Constitution was first drafted. :P \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Original: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/71bfbz/were_planning_to_purchase_sovereignty_from_a/dnac0q7/\n\n\nSpecifically, \n&gt;\"It could also be argued that is how the United States of America became recognized in international affairs. Even as \"recent\" as World War I (aka \"The Great War\"), the USA didn't have any embassies with any of the major European countries. They had \"Legations\" with many countries, but that was definitely an inferior tier of recognition. It certainly took quite a while even after the War for Independence to have almost anybody recognize the USA as an independent sovereign country.\"\n\n\nSo I was entertaining myself with a little light, Friday-evening reading with classic Reddit fare: libertarians plotting yet another novel way to establish their own country. (Full disclosure: I am not a Libertarian, nor do I think this project likely to find any more success than the previous few dozen. However, I do find the whole idea quite interesting.) \n\n\nBut imagine my surprise when I was torn from my evening calm by an unexpected sprinkling of the some of the most specific badhistory I've come across yet; nestled in the above-linked block. \n\n\nSpecifically, I'm referring to the most peculiar claim that the USA was not recognized widely for 'quite a while' by the various world powers, up until the outbreak of the first World War, and when it was, it was some sort of 'definitely inferior' recognition.  This is bad in a way I'm not used to--it's no Lost Cause nonsense, to be sure. It even sounds like it might have an element of truth to it! It's even nestled in between some arguably-true elements. \n\n\nI'll start with the easy part: Every major world power recognized the USA within the first decades of the republic, especially in western Europe. France and Morocco are obvious early-recognizers, and the British obviously with the Treaty of Paris. Thus right off the bat, \"Almost nobody\" is a false claim; the two greatest great powers did so as soon as possible. Spain and various minor kingdoms followed suit for the remainder of the 18th century. Russia waited until  1803; the only moderately-powerful holdouts were the Ottomans, who waited until 1830. Now, speed is relative. Perhaps one might have expected every country to immediately race to recognize the USA. However, the reality is that the USA and, for example, Hanover, had very little to do with one another, and establishing some sort of treaty was of little importance to either country. Thus, it was often delayed for a period of years. But this had nothing to do, in general, with a lack of respect. Diplomacy moves slowly even today.\n&amp;nbsp;\nSo clearly, the existence of the USA was far from a long-running controversy. But what of the second, more intriguing claim? Were the Americans seen as some sort of inferior, evidenced by our diplomatic titles?\n\n\n It's true that the USA did in fact only establish \"Legations\" with various world powers. It is also true that in classic diplomacy, a legation was seen as a lesser sort of mission to an embassy. \n\n\nAlas and alack, the explanation is quite simple. For most European nations, an embassy was seen as superior to a legation because an embassy was the office of an ambassador; an ambassador, in turn, was the direct agent of a monarch. A legation was merely headed by a minister. Clever readers might already see where this is going.\n\n\nThe United States, being a republic, had no monarch to appoint ambassadors. Thus, all American diplomacy was done through legations, headed by ministers. It's absolutely untrue that they were any kind of lower-rank--their first diplomatic mission, in France, was headed by Benjamin Franklin, a man who was more popular with his countrymen than most royals could aspire to be and a well-recognized international figure. Republics, as a rule, did not ever have embassies. Thus, the 'ranking' was irrelevant. (EDIT: Wolfram77 wisely cautions me against the word 'irrelevant,' which in hindsight is misleading. Ambassadors were originally agents of greater powers; as such, a minor kingdom would still only send legations. My intended meaning is that regardless of global influence, the USA would have sent legations out of precedent; so it's not a useful indicator of standing.)\n\n\nThis was the state of European, and thus world, diplomacy for most of the 19th century. Only just before the dawn of World War 1 did this begin to change, as monarchs continued to decline in influence relative to their governments. Most importantly, France became a republic, and yet continued to appoint ambassadors regardless of precedent. With two large powers as republics, and one openly flouting the old convention, it began to fade; the distinction becoming almost entirely ceremonial. (A minister is outranked at events by an ambassador, if both are present.)\n\n\nThe US legation in France became an embassy in 1893, not because of some American show of force, but by the simple act of formally appointing an ambassador; the same man who had previously been the minister. The change was purely cosmetic, a sign of the changing mores of diplomacy. The USA continued sending ambassadors to various countries from that time onwards. The last legation became an embassy in 1966-Hungary.  (I was leaving unsaid the fact that it is the US, not the host country, who appoints an ambassador or sends a minister; thus even if a legation was 'lesser;' this was not a sign of the USA being looked down upon. That'd have made for a boring R5.)\n\n\nDiplomacy is an odd, often-opaque thing, with some strange traditions and a powerful reliance on history and tradition. It's fun to look at the history of how nations communicate, and can tell us quite a lot.  But it's a bad idea to read into it things that are not there: legations can be lesser than embassies, but not always.\n\n\nIn closing, I talk too much about too specific of things.\n\n\nEdit: Apologies for the formatting being sort of tight! I'm still trying to figure out the formatting. \n\n\nSources: \n\nVarious recognitions of the USA: \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nations_by_date_of_recognition_of_the_United_States (Wiki, because it's easier than the State Department's website)\n\nUS Legation and Embassy with France: https://history.state.gov/countries/france\n\nUSA Minister becoming Ambassador due to name change:\nhttps://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/eustis-james-biddle\n\nHungary, 1966: https://history.state.gov/countries/hungary\n",

But it's also got a good amount of bad history and bad philosophy.\n\nHere is one common misconception that plenty other people believe, but I haven't ever heard put to the extreme that Hubbard did:\n\n&gt;\"Anything, therefore, which was Roman was villainous.  This went to such remarkable lengths that the Roman love of bathing made bathing so immoral that Europe went unwashed for some fifteen hundred years.\"\n\n\nUnwashed for 1500 years.  All because anything Roman was hated.

Soap first began to be used widely in the Middle Ages (the Romans and Greeks did not use soap) and soap makers had their own guilds in most larger Medieval towns and cities. \n\nNow that I think about it, the bathing part isn't even the most ludicrous part of that statement. **\"Anything Roman was villainous.**\n\nWhat was the language that Cicero spoke? **Latin**\n\nWhat was the dominant force driving the Middle Ages? **Latin**\n\nWhat was, and still is, the official language of the Catholic Church? **Latin**\n\nHow did something as important as the Roman language survive the cut?\n\nNow for the bonus.  When I was a senior in high school (2001), I had an English teacher who claimed that the only reason we bathe every day is because the Bible says, \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" *[it doesn't].* She said bathing isn't necessary and is a waste of water, and it's only those silly Christians that make us bathe. (Thankfully, she did bathe.)\n\nI think the fact that non-Christians bathed long before Christ was born or the first missionary set foot on their land disproves that claim.\n\n(This teacher, who once was well respected but was becoming quite senile, decided, after giving us a week's worths of rants on everything from the evils of Christianity to the glories of the WNBA, that she didn't want anything to do with us and quit.)\n\nEDIT: Typo",

        "text": "[The Devil's Backbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Backbone) is a 2001 Spanish film by Guillermo del Toro. It's a very good film, especially if you like del Toro's other work. However as it's set during the Spanish Civil War, del Toro unfortunately made a few historical mistakes. \n\nJudging from the dialogue near the beginning of the film, it's supposed to take place near the beginning of 1939, sometime just prior to the fall of Catalonia to the nationalists. Fair enough.\n\nUnfortunately for the historical accuracy of the film, two minor characters are members of the international brigades, who are helping to hide Spanish Republican gold at the orphanage the film is set at - we know they are members of the international brigades because in a later scene we see one of them being executed along with a dozen other members of the international brigades, by the nationalists, and their status as international brigade members is explicitly remarked on in that scene. \n\nThe problems are twofold. First of all, what is this gold that they're hiding out? [The Gold reserves of the Republic were infamously transferred out of the country into the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_gold), where they were used to buy weapons at overinflated prices (the remaining reserves were transferred to France). It's never really explained exactly what the gold is supposed to be from, so perhaps it's not from the Gold reserves. But it still doesn't really make sense in that case, since it's clearly supposed to be from the Republican cause, in which case it begs the question of why it hasn't been used to buy weapons instead of sitting around at an orphanage for some reason, seeing as how no one would accept anything but hard currency from the Republic.\n\nThe second problem is that the film takes place in December 1938, at the earliest (and judging by the climate, it looks more like the spring). The international brigades meanwhile had been ordered out of Spain in October of 1938. Now, around half of the Brigade were from foreign exiles who couldn't return home, so they were instead integrated directly into the Popular Army. Except that explanation doesn't work either for the scene with the international brigades, since it's remarked that one of them is from China - which was not one of the countries that Brigadists were refugees from. TBH, I don't even know why they included the Brigades in the movie since you wouldn't even notice if they didn't point it out. \n\nStill a great film though.\n\n**Source**\n\nThe Battle for Spain, Antony Beevor\n\n\n\n",

The pact also included the soviet Union providing oil to the Germans in exchange for blueprints. At the same time he shows that Baltics are gobbled up by the Soviet Union without mentioning it.\n\n0:08: He says that it didn't ensure peace along the eastern front which is interesting as it would take about 2 years for Hitler to declare war on the Soviet Union. He then goes on to say that \n&gt;Hitler wanted Russia's fertile farmlands and the oil-rich fields of the Caucasus to build a self-sufficient Reich and to establish a base for future conquests. \n\nI know that Hitler wanted lebensraum already before the war but he did not needed those oil fields until **after Barbarossa.** when they placed themselves in a strategically terrible situation.  \nAnd what conquest into the east is he talking about?\n\n&gt; 0:27 Hitler begins his invasion of the east under the name Operation Barbarossa.\n\nProceed to show the area conquered just before operation Uranus.\n\n&gt;0:38 and fueled Hitler's overconfidence, as he ordered the 6th Army, led by Fredrich Paulus into the city of Stalingrad.\n\nSkips completely over case blue, amazing! Seriously how did he miss that? How can anyone miss that!?\n\n&gt;0:56 Unknown to him, however, the Soviet forces would mount their greatest stand here.\n\nI would argue that the soviet forces standed their best in Leningrad and Kursk as they never breached through their lines to begin with. Also where is the struggle at the don?\n\n&gt; 1:13 On the 23rd of August, 1942, the Germans reached the outskirts of the City, and began an aerial bombardment, first targeting the Volga to break the supply lines of troops coming from the east, and then targeted the rest of the City turning much of it into rubble.\n\nI don't recall that they where moving troops and supplies across the Volga before the bombardment and neither can I find that the Luftwaffe was doing that. And did he just place the flanks at the rear?\n\nAt 1:50 he shows that that the Soviet forces where lumped together in a small pocket. There were 2 pockets actually, as the Germans managed to cut off a regiment from the Soviet Forces.\n\n&gt;1:51 Leading the Soviet defenses was Georgy Zhukov\n\nZhukov? At no point did Zhukov command forces inside the city. The one who did was Chuikov a different general with a similar name but certainly not the same guy. And he didn't command on his own, General Eremenko did most of the logistical planning and launched several counter-strokes against the already exposed flanks of the Germans.\n\n&gt;1:54 and he planned a counter-offensive against the Germans.\n\nwell this is a interesting one. While Zhukov did claim that he planned operation Uranus, this is however heavily disputed as they contradict the memoirs of Eremenko. \n\nAt 1:58 he showing an attack in the north. This attack did not happen that close to the 6th army. the flank where the Romanians were was a lot further upstream. while we are at this kind of stuff, there was certainly action in the caucuses.  \n\nthe Germans tried 2 times to force a breakthrough. The first one failed spectacularly as the Germans took heavy losses for no gain while the second attack almost resulted with a encirclement of their tanks.\n\nAs for the rest of the video i will simply list them as this is taking me far too long to write for me.\n\n* No mention of operation little Saturn and operation ring.\n* He shows the army being encircled inside the city while in reality they were mostly outside.\n* No mention of any mayor relief attempt by the Germans.\n* No mention of the Luftwaffe saying that they were able to supply the 6th army.\n\n\nThat was it. Hopefully I did well\n\n\nSources:  \n\"Stalingrad trilogy\" by David M. Glantz and Jonathan M.

        "text": "[Here](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/116363573/), [this image specifically](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1471/74/1471741032456.jpg), [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RadioITEL/status/8354009066403430400), [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HJ4Hh0hyXQ) and [this website].\n\nSo I've seen this claim many, *many*, **many** times all over the inter-webs and various platforms of social media, seeing as it's apparently a popular rhetoric for conspiracy theorists. What I could not find however, is a through, line by line analysis (and debunking) of the claim. So I decided to make one myself, (or at least one to the best of my ability)\nEvery time I see the image/claim, the number tends to be larger than the last one: [47](http://www.rense.com/general85/banished.htm), 54, [100](https://theuglytruth.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/over-a-hundred-locales-expelled-jews-before-zionism-was-even-a-factor-why/), [109](https://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm), [+1,000](http://fathersmanifesto.net/jewsexpelled.htm) etc.\n\nThe statement usually tends to be something along the lines of \"Jews have been kicked out of X number of countries but it's always antisemitism, not what they did/do, but it's no problem right because you can do anything if your God's chosen people amirite?\". Or something like that.\n\nI'll be looking at the list given in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr9fyxUgkok) and [this website](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/79.html) and deciding if 1) It even happened and 2) whether or not it was a result of \"Jewish behaviour\", whatever that's supposed to mean. \n\n&gt; 250 AD - Carthage - expulsion\n\nRight off the bat we have something which I'm going to assume it completely made-up, simply Googling it give me nothing, and the only source I can find says [this](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/carthage).\n\nIf I find similar results on other \"events\" I'll just say so.\n\n&gt; 415 AD - Alexandria - expulsion\n\nCorrect, this did happen. [Cyril of Alaxandria](https://archive.is/s0dt#selection-1225.375-1225.385), who was the Patriarch at that time, used a mob to drive out the Alexandrian Jews that were living in that quarter of the city. \n\nAs for the reasoning, it had more to do with the fact that they *were Jewish* over anything else. The reason for the expulsion had to do with the conflict between Orestes the prefect and Cyril. When Orestes asked for help from Jewish elders to aid in capturing monks who instigated violence towards various Hellenist communities, several of Cyril's men overheard and soon became a cry of sorts to \"drive out the Jews\". \n\nConsidering that Jews had been in the city since it was founded by Alexander the Great, was home to the [Greek Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) and that similar violence was seen by [pagans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia) and [other Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novatianism), I pretty sure I'd be alright if I said it \"wasn't a result of Jewish behaviour\".\n\n&gt; 554 - Diocèse of Clermont (France) - Expulsion\n&gt; 561 - Diocèse of Uzès (France) - Expulsion\n\nThis one was difficult to locate, the Bishop of Diocèse of Clermont from 554-571 was Cautinus, and I found nothing anti-jewish that happened particularly in those years, aside from [various canons](https://books.google.ca/books?id=bxR7vcRjfM4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=Cautinus+to+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fLOPKxLKFM&amp;sig=a-CHFO_dNKBAQ1J7KS-6D_av1i0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP5qOm363WAhUH04MKHcNHDhIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cautinus%20to%20jews&amp;f=false)\n\nWhat it *might* be referring to is [this](http://www.haaretz.com/misc/haaretzcomsmartphoneapp/.premium-1.591194) in the year 576, but this wasn't a forced expulsion, the Jews left on their own accord because they refused to be forced into Christianity.\n\nMost likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 612 - Visigoth - Expelled\n&gt; 642 - Visigoth - Expelled\n\n\nWhile Jews weren't \"expelled\", they did suffer persecution after the conversion of Reccard I from Arianism to Christianity. According to Historian Jane Gerber  \n&gt; that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\". In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism[1](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Jews_of_Spain.html?id=_qmpcSlB8wYC&amp;redir_esc=y). \n\nSo the reason for the persecution was essentially \"not being Catholic\". Before Reccard, they were treated just fine in the kingdom.\n\n&gt; 855 - Italy - Expelled\n\nWell... In 855, Louis II *attempted* to banish all Italian Jews, but his order largely failed because of his conflict with the Byzantines. So he taxed them instead. \n\nI couldn't find any justification.\n\n&gt; 876 - Sens - Expelled\n\nThis likely never happened as the only mention of such occurrence was in a 11th century chronicle that was probably discussing what happen in [Mainz the same year](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sens)\n\n&gt; 1012 - Mainz - Expelled \n\nYes, this did happen, Emperor Henry II expelled all Jewish families in the city after a polemicist pamphlet written by a convert to Judaism (Wecelin)\n\nThey were allowed to return the next year.\n\n&gt; 1182 - France - Expelled \n&gt; 1182 - Germany - Expelled\n\nIn 1182 Philip Augustus \"confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Jews and drove them out of the lands governed by himself directly \"[2](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/jewish/1182-jewsfrance1.asp). The reason for so is that Philp need funds to defeat the various barons who challenged him. In order to do so, he \"he annulled all loans made to Christians by Jews, taking instead a comfortable twenty per cent for himself\". He also believed in Jewish Blood Libel, the idea that Jewish people kidnap Christian children in order to sacrifice them.\n\n&gt; [Philip Augustus had often heard] that the Jews who dwelt in Paris were wont every year on Easter day, or during the sacred week of our Lord's Passion, to go down secretly into underground vaults and kill a Christian as a sort of sacrifice in contempt of the Christian religion. For a long time they had persisted in this wickedness, inspired by the devil, and in Philip's father's time, many of them had been seized and burned with fire. St. Richard, whose body rests in the church of the Holy Innocents-in-the-Fields in Paris, was thus put to death and crucified by the Jews, and through martyrdom went in blessedness to God. [Louis VII, then king, held the Jews guiltless in this death.] Wherefore many miracles have been wrought by the hand of God through the prayers and intercessions of St. Richard, to the glory of God, as we have heard.\n\nIn 1198 he allowed the Jews to return.\n\n&gt; 1276 - Upper Bavaria - Expelled \n\nIn 1276, 180 Jews were burnt at the stake following a Blood libel claim. These people seem to be confusing **literally being murdered** to simply \"being expelled\".\n\n&gt;  1290 - England - Expelled  \n\nThis is true, around 16,000 Jews were expelled by Edward I for not giving him loans\n\n&gt; To help finance his war to conquer Wales, Edward I taxed the Jewish moneylenders. However, the cost of Edward's ambitions soon drained the money-lenders dry. When the Jews could no longer pay, the state accused them of disloyalty, and later forced them to relocate.\n\nI don't see how exactly \"Jewish behaviour\" had anything to do wit this, considering all they did was refuse to pay Edward again after he had taken a large chunk of their wealth\n\n&gt; 1306 - France - Expelled \n\nYes, this happened, in 1306 Philip IV of France (or more ironically, Philip the \"Fair\"), banished all his Jewish subjects and confiscated their lands, goods, and property.\n\nThe reason for so was that he saw Jews as a giant piggy bank, as \" he intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury\".\n\nI don't see why exactly Jews are actually being blamed for someone stealing from them.\n\n&gt; 1322 - France - Expelled\n\nYes, this happened. In 1322 all the Jews in France were expelled. Why? The year before was known as the [great leper scare](\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1321_leper_scare) in which Jews were accused of poisoning Christian wells. 5,000 jews were killed for this, Oh and the king [Philip V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_France#The_.22leper_scare.22) quite literally admitted that the Jews were innocent. So much for \"bad Jewish behaviour\" here.\n\n&gt; 1348 - Switerland -Expelled\n\nThe Jews weren't expelled here. They were massacred. In reaction to the Black Plague, six hundred Jews and the town Rabbis were burned at the stake, 140 children were forcibly baptized, The victims were left unburied, the cemetery destroyed and the synagogue turned into a church. The remaining Jews not allowed to return until 1869.\n\nUnless \"Jewish behaviour\" results in the Black Death, I still don't see how it's their fault.\n\n&gt; \n                        1349 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hungary\n                        1360 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hungary\n                        1370 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Belgium\n                        1380 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Slovakia\n                        1388 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Strasbourg\n                        1394 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Germany\n                        1394 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - France\n\nMore Black Death shenanigans.\n\n&gt; 1398 - Czechoslovakia - expelled\n\nNo, once again, they were **massacred** here. Not \"expelled\". The only things that were \"expelled\" here were the Jewish souls headed on to the afterlife.\n\nAnd the horrid \"Jewish behaviour\" responsible for such a repercussion? \n\nA group of Jewish boys were playing with a ball of sand, one of them accidentally hit a priest. The priest, feeling offended, insisted that the Jewish was community purposely plotting against him. Roughly 3,000 Jews were killed for this. [Duke Wenceslaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia) stated that \"that the responsibility rested with the Jews for venturing outside during Holy Week.\"\n\n**I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.**\n\n\n&gt; 1420 - Lysons - Expelled\n\nWell, according to [this](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10212-lyons) an edict by Charles VI in 1394 stated that all Jewish people must leave the city.\n\nWhy? If my source is correct:\n\n&gt; From this time until the middle of the eighteenth century Jews were not allowed to live in Lyons. Two documents, dated respectively 1548 and 1571, show that their presence was at these dates considered a scandal to the city and the Christian religion.\n\nSome of you with eagle eyes will point out: \"Hey, Charles decreed the expulsion in 1394, but the date given is 1420!\"\n\nFear not my fine eyed friends! Tis' not a typo, seems that no one actually enforced Charles IV's declaration until nearly three decades later \n\n&gt; 1421 - Austria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1424 - Freibourg - Expelled \n\nAgain, Most likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1424 - Zurich - Expelled \n\n[For the third time, most likely didn't happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6PbdJiAK84)\n\n&gt; 1424 - Cologne - Expelled\n\nThis could be referring to the [the expulsion in 1426](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4550-cologne#anchor7), but nothing in two years earlier.\n\n&gt; 1432 - Saxony - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happpen\n\n&gt; 1438 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1439 - Austria - Expelled\n\nYes, this did happen. [Albert II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II_of_Germany) who had [a long previous history of anti-semitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_II_of_Germany#Expulsion_of_the_Jews).\n\nIn 1439 he accepted 900 *gulden* from the city of Ausenborg in exchange for permission to expel their Jewish residents. He agreed.\n\nOh, and his moniker was Albert the **Magnanimous**. What is with Medieval kings and ironic nicknames?\n\nAs for why exactly, I couldn't find much. But to make up for that, here's [Albert's face](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Albrecht_II._von_Habsburg.jpg/200px-Albrecht_II._von_Habsburg.jpg) beside an image of [Spoderman](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/286/500/2d0.jpg).\n\nCoincidence? \n\nI think not!\n\n&gt; 1442 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nI think this *might* be referring to Pope Eugenius IV putting out an edict which prevented Jewish people from: building synagogues, holding public office, testifying against Christians, among other things.\n\nThey weren't actually expelled here, they just chose to leave to other parts of Italy instead.\n\nIf it's not talking about the above, then it most likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 1444 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nIn 1444 a city named Utrecht in the Netherlands passed legislation which stated \"Jews to be imprisoned, tortured, killed, and expelled\".\n\nThe reason for such is not known exactly, but it is believed that the justification was a from bishop named Wolravus of Meurs who claimed Jews would \"privately criticise Christianity\".\n\nThe expulsion was later repealed and they were allowed to return.\n\n&gt; 1446 - Bavaria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1453 - Franconis - Expelled\n\nWTF is a Franconis? The place doesn't exist, let alone the incident.\n\n&gt; 1454 - Würzburg - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1462 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nIn *Italy* (read: Not Germany) Jews were expelled, because they lost business from competition from Franciscans.\n\nJews perform poorly at the market? What a bunch of lazy freeloaders! EXPEL THEM\n\nJews become wealthy? They must be all-powerful and out to ruin society. EXPEL THEM\n\n&gt; 1483 - Mainz - Expelled\n\nThe only non-J00zsareouttogetus claim I could find of this incident is a one line reference in [this book](https://books.google.ca/books?id=WDnbzk4-BmkC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=1483+mainz+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Imm76e1zsl&amp;sig=ko8i0YF5LlkxBrH-utRTnzYUrro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO8JekmL7WAhVs4oMKHQH6AFQQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1483%20mainz%20jews&amp;f=false) that's discussing Black death expulsions.\n\n&gt; 1484 - Warsaw - Expelled\n\nGot nuthin' here\n\n&gt; 1485 - Italy - Expelled\n\nRead above line.\n\n&gt; 1492 - Spain - Expelled\n&gt; 1492 - Italy - Expelled\n\nWait... what?\n\nAre these people really using 1492 as an example of \"horrible Jewish behaviour\"???\n\nLet's see what happened in [1492](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1492)\n\n1) [Jewish people being scheming, insidious etc. and totally deserving of this hate targeted at them and **only them, specifically**](https://developers.oxwall.com/ow_userfiles/plugins/base/11046-Page%20not%20found%2015-12-2016%2011.17.02.png)\n\nOR\n\n2) [Something else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista)\n\n&gt; 1495 - Lithuania - Expelled\n\nYep, the Friar, John of Capistrano personally instigated anti-Jewish riots. \n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; Though his main aim was to instigate a popular rebellion against the Hussites, he also carried out a ruthless campaign against the Jews whom he accused of profaning the Christian religion. As a result of Capistrano's endeavours, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Shortly after, John of Capistrano, invited to Poland by Zbigniew Olesnicki, conducted a similar campaign in Krakow and several other cities where, however, anti-Jewish unrest took on a much less acute form. Forty years later, in 1495, Jews were ordered out of the centre of Krakow and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz. In the same year, Alexander Jagiellon, following the example of Spanish rulers, banished the Jews from Lithuania. For several years they took shelter in Poland until they were allowed back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1503.\n\nI think it's alright if I take a pass on blaming (((the jews))) for being scapegoated by Christians... to wage wars on other Christians.\n\n&gt; 1496 - Naples - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1498 - Numberg - Expelled\n\nIt's possible this did happen, but the incident was in 1499, not 1498.\n\nThe reason why is unknown.\n\n&gt; 1510 - Brandenburg - Expelled\n\nFor the utmost time, this wasn't an \"expulsion\". ~50 Jews were burnt at stake for blasphemy.\n\n&gt; 1510 - Prussia - Expelled\n\nYes, the Jews here were accused of [Host desecration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_desecration) and expelled.\n\n&gt; 1514 - Strasbourg - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1515 - Genoa - Expelled\n\nYep. This did happen, though they were [readmitted a year later](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/genoa)\n\n&gt; 1519 - Rensegurburg - Expelled\n\n[Gee, I wonder why?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism)\n\n&gt; 1533 - Naples - Expelled\n&gt; 1541 - Naples - Expelled\n\nActually they weren't expelled here. The invading Spaniards forced any Jewish person who couldn't pay 300 ducanti a year to leave.\n\nIn later years (ie 1541) they raised the price, so the entire Jewish community got up and left.\n\n&gt; 1542 - Bohemia and Prague - Expelled \n\nMost likely never happened\n\n&gt; 1547 - Russia - Expelled\n\nYeah, you see here, this was a result of a unruly young chap literally (and quite aptly) named [Ivan the **Terrible**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible) saying \"Jews bring about great evil\".\n\nAt least the Medieval nickname-givers were getting better at their job I see.\n\n&gt; 1550 - Genoa - Expelled\n\nUmm... in 1550 Genoa expelled *a Jew*. As in, one person. That being [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ha-Kohen) for practising medicine when it was supposed to be a \"Christian only\" occupation, which was a tad bit unfortunate seeing that [Christian doctors were known for refusing to treat Jewish patients]\n\n&gt; 1551 - Bavaria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen.\n\n&gt; 1555 - Pesaro - Expelled\n\nRead above line\n\n&gt; 1561 - Prague - Expelled\n\nRead the above line, again.\n\n&gt; 1569 - Papal States - Expelled\n\nYep. Pope Pius V expelled all Jews outside of Ancona and Rome. \n\nHe also burned tens of thousands of Talmuds :(\n\n&gt; 1571 - Venice - Expelled\n\nThe Venetian government, at war with Turkey, resolves to expel all Jews from Venice and the Adriatic Islands. Though the expulsion is not enforced, it reflects the impact of the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation) and the papal willingness to sacrifice local commercial interests to doctrinal necessities.\n\n&gt; 1582 - Netherlands - Expelled\n\nI wouldn't blame the Netherlands here, as they were actually tolerant of Jews (compared to other Christian states).\n\nThe reason they were \"expelled\" here at all had nothing to do with Holland, but actually Spain when Charles V invaded and took over the territory where Jewish people resided.\n\n&gt; 1593 - Austria - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1597 - Milan - Expelled\n\nYep, around 900 Jews were forced out of Milan after Spain conquered the city.\n\n&gt; 1597 - Cremonia, Pavia, and Lodi - Expelled\n\nWhy did he lump all of these together?\n\nGoogling all three gives me nothing, and googling them one by one has the same result.\n\nIf you're was going to make up three separate incidents, you might as well put them in three separate places\n\nI'll just go with \"All three probably never happened\".\n\n&gt; 1614 - Frankfurt - Expelled\n\nYes, this happened. In 1614 an interesting young individual named [Vincenz Fettmilch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenz_Fettmilch) who previously worked as a grocer and gingerbread baker, decided to get his [genocide gloves on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse#The_Fettmilch_Rising) from 1612 to 1614. In one attack on a Jewish city (Judengasse) him and his merry mob men sacked the town's 1,300 Jews and forced them to leave.\n\nHe also called himself the \"new Haman of the Jews\". Yes, he was talking about [that Hamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman)\n\n\n&gt; 1615 - Worms - Expelled\n\nA guild \"non-violently\" expelled the city's Jews.\n\nFrom the [Haaretz article](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.715272)\n\n&gt; On this day, April 20, 1615, the Jews of Worms were persuaded that it was in their interest to leave the city without delay. While the local citizenry took pride in employing non-violent means after having abused their Jewish neighbors for centuries, arguably the means used to get them to go, which included starvation and threats of expulsion, were not quite benign. \n\n&gt; 1619 - Keiv - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1648 - Ukraine - Expelled\n\nWHAT?\n\nThey're talking about ***Chmielnicki massacre*** \n\n**You know, the one where Ukrainian Cossacks killed anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people and is considered the worst massacre in Jewish history Pre-Holocaust?**\n\n&gt; 1656 - Lithuania - Expelled\n\nMost likely never happed\n\n&gt; 1669 - Oran (North Africa) - Expelled\n\nI've never actually heard of a Jewish expulsion in North Africa pre-1900s.\n\nAs with Carthage, googling this give me nothing so I'm assuming it never happened.\n\n&gt; 1669 - Vienna - Expelled\n\nYes, the Holy Roman Empire did begin a round of expulsions in 1669 but Emperor Leopold I called them back later the same year\n\n&gt; 1712 - Sandomir - Expelled\n\nJews expelled from Sandomir, following blood libel claims\n\n&gt; 1727 - Russia - Expelled\n\nWell this one was difficult to pin down, but it turns out that in 1727 [Catherine I](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catherine_I_of_Russia) ordered all Jews expelled from Russia, although to what extent the order is implemented is unclear.\n\nThere is [actually evidence of Jewish life in Russia throughout the 1720's and 1730's](https://books.google.ca/books?id=vL60sEf7OPoC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=1727+Jews+expelled+russia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=woWDzOIVa6&amp;sig=aaYQvb_XCUqvsWtdrFvXAVgnaow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBrd2_yL7WAhVNzGMKHVfiDfYQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1727%20Jews%20expelled%20russia&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt; 1738 - Württemberg - Expelled\n\nActually no Jews were \"expelled\" here, although one Jewish person was hanged. The full story of this revolves around a Catholic Duke by the name of [Karl Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Alexander,_Duke_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg) and his [court Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew) Joseph Süß Oppenheimer. \n\nAs a financial advisor for Duke Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, he also gained a prominent position as a court Jew and held the reins of the finances in his duchy. He established a duchy monopoly on the trade of salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory. Being both Jewish and successful, he evidently made a boatload of enemies, but had the protection of Alexander. When Karl Alexander died suddenly in 1737, Oppenheimer was arrested and accused of various things, including fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies, accepting bribes, and trying to \"reestablish\" Catholicism. Oppenheimer was hanged in 1738.\n\nIronically, Oppenheimer **was** given to option to convert to Christianity and you know, *not* die, but he refused. The irony comes from the fact that they blamed him for spreading Catholicism, as if a religious Jew would try to get people to become Catholic.\n\nOppenheimer was actually used in [Nazi propaganda]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jud_S%C3%BC%C3%9F_(1940_film)\n\nBut no expulsion here.\n\n&gt; 1744 - Prague - Expelled\n\nIn 1744 Archduchess Maria Theresa orders: \"... no Jew is to be tolerated in our inherited duchy of Bohemia\".\n\nA handful of years later, she reverses her position, on condition that Jews pay for readmission every ten years. This extortion was known as malke-geld (queen's money).\n\n&gt; 1761 - Bordeaux - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1772 - Russia - Expulsion\n\nThis has to to do with the [Catherine II](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catherine_the_Great). Like the first one, she apparently didn't like Jews all too much, as she created the [Pale Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement)\n\nAs to why, it had to do with [The First Partition of Poland](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/First_Partition_of_Poland) in 1722, before that Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a \"Jew\" is, since the term meant many things during her reign. Judaism was a small religion in Russia until the year of the partition. To make a new problem small as quickly as she could, she created a ghetto to keep Jewish people in.\n\nThis probably wasn't an \"expulsion\" as these people are thinking it is, as the Jews were still technically in the Russian Empire\n\n&gt; 1775 - Warsaw - Expelled\n\nNope. No expulsion here. in 1775 a group of soldiers invaded a Jewish suburb and ransacked the wealth found there, and demolished all the Jewish houses and synagogues. They then took the items they looted and sold them at auction.\n\nIf you seriously think this was a result of \"Jewish behaviour\" or \"it's the Jew's fault\" you're just victim blaming at this point.\n\n&gt; 1789 - Alsace - Expelled\n\nNot exactly an expulsion, in the years prior to 1789 anti-Jewish riots broke out. The Jewish people were being blamed for rising tensions and the French revolution.  Later in 1789, speaking in a debate on the eligibility of Jews for citizenship, the Count of Clermont-Tonnerre had this to say:\n\n&gt; \"The Jews,\" he said, \"should be denied everything as a nation, but granted everything as individuals.\" \"It is intolerable,\" he continued, \"that the Jews should become a separate political formation or class within the country. Every one of them must individually become a citizen; if they do not want this, they must inform us and we shall then be compelled to expel them.\"[3](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1997/11/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity)\n\nUnless you can manage to convince me that the literal *French Revolution* was \"Jewish behaviour\", Imma skip on blaming Jews for this one.\n\n&gt; 1804 - Villages in Russia - Expelled\n&gt; 1808 - Villages and the Russian countryside - Expelled\n\nI've found no confirmation of these, but I don't doubt. In the 19th century Russia was largely becoming more and more secularised, to the dismay of the more religious country folk. In order to come to grips with rapidly advancing times, village leaders would blame the Jewish minority and organise pogroms aimed at them.\n\n&gt;  1815 LeBeck and Bremen - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1815 - Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria - Expelled \n\nWhy have all three as separate entities? Both Franconia and Swabia are regions *in* Bavaria.\n\nMost likely never happened.\n\n&gt; 1820 - Bremen - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1843 - Russian Border, Austria, Prussia - Expelled\n\nWhat is it with this guy and lumping multiple \"expulsions\" together?\n\nIt's almost like... they never happened?\n\n&gt; 1862 - United States - Expelled\n\nAhhh, they're talking [General Grant's General Order Number 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._11_(1862).\n\nWhat happened here was G. Grant put out an issue that declared the removal of all Jews in his military jurisdiction, which included parts of Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The official reason as to why was officially claimed by Grant to \"cut down on the black market prevalent in the Union, especially the sale of unregistered cotton by Jews\".\n\nThe bill was never actually passed however, as Abraham Lincoln himself revoked the order. It's interesting to note that in the years that followed Grant became the American President and seemed to abandon his previous feelings of Jews, as well as developed a thing for them. He raised awareness of anti-Jewish atrocities going on in Europe, took back his previous statements of the draft asserting it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading, in the press of warfare, and became the first American President to visit a synagogue.\n\nIn other words, no \"expulsion took place\".\n\n&gt; 1866 - Galatz - Expelled\n\nMost likely didn't happen\n\n&gt; 1880s - Russia - Expelled\n\nRead above entry for expulsions for Russian villages, but imagine it 1,000 times more intense, occasionally within cities, and with less justification. \n\nAlso why did they suddenly decide to lump the entire decade together?\n\n&gt; 1891 - Moscow - Expelled\n\nAn imperial decree was promulgated (March 28, 1891) ordering the expulsion from the city and government of Moscow of all Jewish artisans, brewers, and distillers. As to why only artists, brewers, and distillers, I have no idea, but it might have had to do with [our magic vegetable](https://books.google.ca/books?id=R4tStGjCAPgC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W72JBTv98t&amp;sig=_otzRqhZYpA2ju-0Mos49Q4PNGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt; 1938-45 - Germany - Expelled\n\n[Hmmm](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Thinking_Face_Emoji_grande.png?v=1480481060)\n\n[Guys what can they be talking about](https://media.giphy.com/media/CaiVJuZGvR8HK/giphy.gif)\n\n[No seriously people I have no idea what this could be referring to](https://media1.giphy.com/media/xUPGcz2H1TXdCz4suY/200.webp#3-grid1)\n\n~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~\n\nAnd that's it folks!\n\nHere are various other reasons why Jewish people were persecuted throughout history:\n\n\n   *  They were foreigners with no formal citizenship anywhere in their\n                diaspora.\n   *  They were scattered throughout the world, never concentrated\n                in a single area.\n   *  Historically, Jewish relations tended to be more solitary\n   *  In Medieval Europe, Jews were literally the only non-Christian minority, so when things got iffy (hint hint Black \n                Death) there was only one minority to blame. Nowadays, there's multiple: Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, \n                or Catholics, take ya pick.\n   *  What happened to the Jewish people happened to practically every minority group in history, if you put the \n                same scrutiny towards other people eg.

He tries to advertise himself as a more intellectual variant of the Geert Wilder's PVV, the other major right wing populist party. He has a PhD in Law, regularly uses terms like \"oikophobia\" and \"cultural Marxism\", and started most famously his maiden speech in Latin, although his Latin was riddled with mistakes. Recently on social media he has been arguing the following: \n\n&gt;The EU has been founded to wage war and to limit free trade. The idea was after all to fight the Soviet Union and that could only be done with a led planned economy behind the facades of a national fake democracy. The EU has nothing to do with peace and prosperity.\n\nHe said this in a facebook post as a reaction to a column arguing that the EU and its forebearers were founded to bring peace and prosperity. The source of the quote above is [here](https://twitter.com/ajboekestijn/status/906170094581112832) in a screenshot by a right wing historian who says here that this is nonsense. Thierry Baudet has repeated this basic idea in various tweets, for instance today [here](https://twitter.com/thierrybaudet/status/909028155037487104)\n\n&gt;EU has nothing to do with \"peace\" or \"free trade\". It was founded to wage the cold war via central planned politics and planned economy.\n\n\nHe claims however that people who say this is bulshit are not as knowledgeable as he is. After all, his PhD was about the EU.  So, why do I, not a historian, think this is incorrect? Well, according to Wikipedia the first incarnation of the EU, the European Coal and Steel Community was founded  \n\n&gt;intended to help economic growth and cement peace between France and Germany, who had previously been longtime enemies. Coal and steel were particular symbolic as they were the resources necessary to wage war.\n\n[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_European_Coal_and_Steel_Community_\\(1945–57\\)) The Wikipedia page linked here does mention a European military cooperation, but that lead to the NATO, not the EU. I hope this rule 5 is enough. I also hope this post isn't too political, since Baudet is quite a controverial figure, and it deals with the EU, which is also a politically charged subject.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! Lars Andersen, the noted archery fraud, has released another video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dBQVDROdA\n\nAs it contains numerous inaccuracies, I thought I should address them. I should state that, first and foremost, I am *not* an archer and nor do I have any experience with archery, either as a sport or in terms of reenactment. For this reason I shall examine his claims from an academic and historical perspective by utilizing various primary and secondary sources that clearly contradict his assertions. My imaginary drink shall be a bottle of Woodford Reserve Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey, so let us begin!\n\n0.05: The narrator says that Lars Andersen is trying to reinvent historical archery. There are two problems with this. The first is that archery was employed across the world, which each individual culture maintaining their own unique methods and approaches . Thus there was no *single* style to reinvent. Secondly, many traditional forms such as Mongolian and Japanese archery still exist, so there are still plenty of practices that have not been lost and require no reinvention to begin with. DRINK!\n\n0.13: The narrator is referring to movie depictions of archery as if they are proper sources that competitive bowmen, reenactors and historians rely on. If Lars Andersen want to critique popular images of archery, he is welcome to do so, but such representations have *nothing* to do with archery as it is studied and practiced. DRINK!\n\n1.12: The narrator says an archer must be able to shoot and move rapidly. This is complete and utter nonsense because they are assuming there was only one style of archery, and one type of archer, and that they existed in an unchanging form throughout history. The standing regiments of the Persian Achaemenid Empire employed archers in a static formation behind shield walls:\n\n\"the Persians had made a palisade of their wicker-work shields and were discharging their arrows in great multitude and without sparing,—Pausanias, seeing that the Spartans were hard pressed and that the offerings did not prove favourable, fixed his gaze upon the temple of Hera of the Plataians and called upon the goddess to help, praying that they might by no means be cheated of their hope\"\n\nArtwork of Assyrian archers also show them standing behind a shield-bearer, meaning jumping about like a caffeine-infused squirrel was not their preferred method of shooting:\n\nhttp://biblelandpictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2435-3-Assyrian-archers.jpg\n\nIt is also useful two note that the two archers in the image are drawing the bow at the same time, indicating that volley shooting may have indeed been used, although they would have not been held  at a draw as that would have been too tiring. \n\nMoving onwards to Roman history, Anna Komnena describes the following formation designed by the Emperior Alexios Komnenos:\n\n\"Having noticed this from long experience the Emperor arranged his lines and phalanxes in such a way that the Turks should shoot from the right side, the side on which the shields were advanced, and that our men should shoot from the left, the side on which the Turks’ bodies were unprotected.\"\n\nThe reference to lines and phalanxes makes it clear that it was an ordered formation, and that the archers would thereby be shooting from a stationary position. \n\nEnguerrand de Monstrelet, writing in the 15th century AD, describes the English archers as being both stationary (one does not plant stakes into the ground if one planes to cavort) and shooting as a mass volley:\n\n\"The rest of the English remained with king Henry, and were shortly after drawn up in battle array by sir Thomas Erpingham, a knight grown grey with age and honour, who placed the archers in front, and the men-at-arms behind them. He then formed two wings of men-at-arms and archers, and posted the horses with the baggage in the rear. Each archer planted before himself a stake sharpened at both ends. \"\n\nand \n\n\"Their archers, amounting to at least thirteen thousand, let off a shower of arrows with all their might, and as high as possible, so as not to lose their effect: \"\n\nSimilarly, speed of shooting was not always preferred. The Roman writer, Vegetius, described the training of archers:\n\n\"A third or fourth of the youngest and fittest soldiers should also be exercised at the post with bows and arrows made for that purpose only. The masters for this branch must be chosen with care and must apply themselves diligently to teach the men to hold the bow in a proper position, to bend it with strength, to keep the left hand steady. to draw the right with skill, to direct both the attention and the eye to the object, and to take their aim with equal certainty either on foot or on horseback. But this is not to be acquired without great application, nor to be retained without daily exercise and practice. \"\n\nStrength and accuracy is clearly emphasized as opposed to letting loose as many arrows as possible. \n\nDRINK!\n\n1.16: The video is showing a page from the Strategikon of Maurice to support the assertion archers always shot rapidly. This ignores that methods of archery were different depending on the culture and time period. DRINK! \n\n1.20: The narrator claims that, as we know from tribal warfare and historical texts that an archer who stands still and shoots slowly is useless. So useless they were used in a stationary fashion for thousands of years. DRINK!\n\n1.24: The narrator says fast-shooting is the only way to get past a shield, whilst showing people getting hit by arrows whilst carrying ahistorical shields. A Roman scutum from the Republican era:\n\nhttp://www.roman-reenactor.com/wpimages/wp949aa6da_05_06.jpg\n\nCould protect a wielder completely from a bowman, not matter how fast they shot. \n\nDRINK!\n\n1.37: The narrator states historical archers would train on moving targets whilst in motion themselves. From which culture and which era? Anna Komena writes:\n\n\"The Emperor arrived in Thessalonica, as already stated, and there prepared for Bohemund’s crossing by training the recruits in stretching the bow and shooting arrows at a mark\"\n\nThis is a clear reference to 'historical' Byzantine archers shooting at a non-moving target. Artwork such as this image from the 14th century Luttrell Psalter:\n\nhttp://www.historic-uk.com/assets/Images/luttrellarchery.jpg?1430303998\n\nAlso show archers taking aim at a stationary target whilst not comporting themselves in the manner of gymnasts. It was horse archers who would train whilst in motion.\n\nDRINK!\n\n1.44: The narrator says archers never used the well-known round target with separation lines. Except for the CLEAR ROUND TARGET WITH SEPARATION LINES FROM THE LUTTRELL PSALTER! DRINK!\n\n2.09: The narrator claims that historical bows consisted only of string and bow, and nothing else. This is an immensely gross simplification. Historical bows could be constructed of multiple materials, with various design elements such as siyahs and laths. Bow cases were also important, they could protect the bow from humid conditions which could cause it to weaken. DRINK!\n\n2.12: The narrator seems to think modern sport archery and ancient and medieval war archery were the same thing. DRINK!\n\n3.14: Now the narrator is stating how advantageous trick-shooting was in battle. I have an image now of a Persian archer somersaulting through the ranks at Thermopylae and killing Leonidas with a curving arrow in slow-motion.\n\n3.31: Congratulations Lars, you shot the horse. A pity it was wearing armor and just trampled you and crushed your skull. Alternatively, the horse kept on going because the single arrow was not enough to kill it and the rider just put a lance into your throat.\n\n3.84: Okay guys, you heard it here first. Everything in an ancient myth can be taken literally!\n\n4.05: Hitting an arrow in flight is not really useful when there are several thousand more coming at you. Battlefield conditions were completely different from trick-shooting. DRINK!\n\nSources:\n\nThe Alexiad, by Anna Komnena: http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/alexiad_dawes.pdf\n\nThe Chronicles of Enguerrand de Monstrelet: http://deremilitari.org/2013/02/battle-of-agincourt-1415\n\nThe Composite Bow, by Mike Loades\n\nDe Re Militari, by Vegetius: http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/index.php#b106\n\nThe Histories, Volume Two, by Herodotus: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2456/2456-h/2456-h.htm\n",

The examples provided are interesting and occasionally overlooked in academic settings. Spread the knowledge, learn lots!\n\nThe second part of his post is where it gets bad.  Harboringonalament suggests a narrative that early Native American writing systems spread from Europe, a claim justified by the journal account of a priest concluding that mysterious writings off a stone ruin were in Hebrew. At least s/he remains skeptical...\n\n&gt;If this story is reliable, and there is some evidence of shipwrecks from the Roman era here and there, it would suggest that possibly the Native Americans learned these styles and techniques from lost-at-sea people, possibly explaining why Meso-American ruins tend to have a certain Mediterranean style to them.\n\nWhat? Roman shipwrecks? The Sea-People? Mediterranean style? Unsubstantiated Eurocentric evidence #4?\nOf course! How un-enlightened of me. As we all know, the only advancements in human progress stem from classical Greece, and other cultures couldn't possibly be creative or smart enough to develop on their own. \n\n&gt;Alternatively, the vague similarities of some Meso-American deities to Norse paganism may hint at a more recent cross-pollination of cultures from the Viking attempts to colonize. As an example:\nThe Aztec god Huitzilopochtli\nGod of war\nMissing Hand\nFeathered tall hair\nSlays a Lizard\nSacrificed to, in order to prevent \"infinite night\"\nThe Norse god Týr\nGod of war\nMissing Hand\nFiery tall hair\nSlays a wolf\nWhile not direct, Norse religion believes in an \"infinite night\" that Týr fights against.\n\nLow hanging fruit. Heathen natives couldn't even come up with their own pantheon, so they had to appropriate from the Norse. \n\nHarboringonalament has taken it upon him/herself to be the resident expert in this thread, where s/he generalizes heavily [including his suspicions that Meso-American earthen mounds were inspired by the Egyptian pyramids.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/709jxo/untitled_lehi_thundervoice_eagle_acrylic_17/dn1v2tr/)\n\nBut my favorite part, my absolute favorite part, is the user's [conclusion that searching for *actual evidence* is worthy of offense, as it gets conflated with Mormon mythology.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/709jxo/untitled_lehi_thundervoice_eagle_acrylic_17/dn1t660/)\n&gt;These things are not heavily researched due to the rarity of the evidence. And, no offense, searching for actual evidence often gets littered with various Mormon myths.\n\nConsidering harboringonalament's posting history is very Christian-centric*, the irony of this statement is completely lost on him/her. \n\nI know I am taking this on a personal level for some reason, but I feel that when amateur historians talk out their asses like this, it undermines so much of my very, very tedious efforts at research and dedication to historical accuracy. \n\n\n^^^I ^^^do ^^^not ^^^intend ^^^to ^^^disparage ^^^Christianity, ^^^Mormonism, ^^^or ^^^any ^^^other ^^^belief. ^^^The ^^^only ^^^**true** ^^^deity ^^^is ^^^the ^^^almighty ^^^volcano.",

        "text": "Lindybeige is one of those \"pop\" historians that seem to get away with quite a bit of badhistory. Whenever the very idea of discussing British history crops up he lets his rather obvious nationalistic bias crop up as he froths on about [how the Bren gun won the war]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr4MdqXbk7c), or how the [Belgians were idiots for not trusting the British and French]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr4MdqXbk7c) at the start of the Second World War. Furthermore, he often refuses to accept legitimate criticism from people who are far knowledgeable about a topic than he is. For this you can see the responses to his ridiculous Bren Gun Debacle. \n \nBut that does not mean to say that I dislike Lindy. He’s one of the most charismatic YouTube historians, usually making fascinating videos about the topics he discusses. I often find myself going back to his discussion of the Iliad (which as a dirty uncultured swine I thought to include the whole of the Trojan War, and he corrected my entire view on it). His discussion on the tragedy of war is also nothing short of spectacular. He was also the first YouTube historian that I subscribed to, back in the days of yore. I really do like Lindy, despite his flaws. \n \nThis post is about one of his older videos. There are historians here who are far better versed in the Second World War, and who I feel would make far better analysis of his videos on that subject. But there was a video, in 2014, [where he says that the scythe cannot be a good weapon]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rzQwzg5_mo). I will also be talking about his [response to criticism video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_endKNXkdOY), though that will come later. In the response, he admittedly discusses some of the points that I shall make, and further some of the comments he left in the comments section of the videos.\n\nFirst, let's get this out of the way: I'm Polish. The scythe is an important cultural item for us, and for our struggles to regain independence following the [Partitions of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland). That is why I put into question Lindy's implication that scythes cannot be good weapons. Having said that, and I shall make this point bold as it is important, **Lindy believes that normal, unchanged scythes are bad weapons, and not ones that have been repurposed.** This does not detract from my analysis though, because he only makes that point in the comments of his response video and NOT in any of the actual videos. What is a statement worth if you do not make it clear enough?\n\nAnyway, on with the show.\n\nFirst, Central and Eastern European scythes have straight hafts. [Here are two different scythes side-by-side](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/2%20snath%20types.jpg). [Here’s another image of straight scythes]( https://www.permaculture.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/festival.jpg). The statement that scythe shafts are all bent is therefore entirely incorrect. In his rebuttal he does say that the shafts have handles attached to them, but handles can be removed fairly easily even if they are present.\n \nOnto the blade thickness. Admittedly I’m not an expert on agricultural implements and the optimal thickness of a scythe, but I think Lindy might overestimate the thickness of metal required to cut through someone, and possibly overestimate the metal quality and by extension underestimate the metals used in agricultural tools of the 16th-19th centuries. \n \nFirst, the thickness of many swords towards the centre of percussion – where the blade’s strike is the strongest – can be around 3mm. This isn’t what I’d call thicc, and many scythes have a spine to stiffen the blades. When you consider that the time period I am talking about is the 18th and 19th centuries, where armour was mostly gone from the battlefield and thick clothes would be the most that the vast majority of soldiers would face, you can imagine that a scythe blade would be sufficient, especially if the metal is thicker due to being of poorer quality than modern perfectly heat-treated monosteel.\n\nSecondly, repurposing a scythe makes perfect sense since you already have the material, and you would not have to even heat it since it's very likely that the scythes were made out of a fairly mild steel, as said above, which means that you don't even have to heat it to bend it, then heat treat it again. The advantage of this is immense: any village blacksmith - whose main jobs would be working with agricultural tools anyway - would be able to turn your scythe into a war scythe.\n\nFinally, we even know exactly what was done to turn a normal scythe into a war scythe. [According to the Polish Wikipedia page](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosa_bojowa) the \"typical changes done to repurpose a farming scythe into a weapon are:\n\n- bending the blade of the scythe by 90 degrees, to be parallel with the haft.\n- Reinforcing the ring attaching the blade to the haft (for instance by extending the sleeve or adding rivets)\n- Reinforcing the wood of the haft, especially towards the blade.\n- Occasionally the blade would be replaced with blades from a chaff-cutter\"\n\nAside from the last one, all of these repurpose a normal scythe from an agricultural implement into a weapon of war. More importantly, they're very simple and can be done quickly to arm an entire peasant revolt, which is exactly where the war scythe found the most use.\n\nLindy does make a few other points, but because he does not make them very clear it's hard to argue for or against. Overall he has the right idea - I don't think that unchanged scythes make good weapons - but he didn't really consider all of the factors, and has the usual problem of viewing his word as the gospel, and being unable to acknowledge that he's wrong. I think he got there in the end though, since many people rebutted him in the comments of his videos.",

So it doesn't come as a surprise that for most of us, the anniversary of 9/11 is a day to be sombre, and remember the lives of the people who were taken not only on that day, but the many days that followed, all over the world. It's a day to remind ourselves of the devastation that occurred, and the change it brought.\n\n\n\nUnless...\n\n\n\nUnless of course...\n\n\n\nYou're a r/T_D regular.\n\n\n\nThan for you 9/11 is a wonderful excuse to write long incoherent paragraphs about dem evil [insert Muslims/Brown people/Arabs/Jooz/Israelis/ or big bad spoopy Gov't], often bridled with layers upon layers of badhistory and some *really shitty* grammar. Luckily for me, I'll be the one shifting through the garbage heap, finding heaps and heaps of the glorious stuff this subreddit loves.\n\n\nThis year's r/T_D badhistory posts on 9/11 can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6zg56s/since_911_there_have_been_35000_deadly_islamic/) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6za0ln/can_you_imagine_a_world_without_islam/). I'll just be skimming over the comments for R5.\n\n(Side Note: Oh yeah, I'm nerfing some of the comments because there's a lot of stuff I really shouldn't repeat in there) \n\n\nLet's start with the second most popular comment [here](np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6za0ln/can_you_imagine_a_world_without_islam/dmtnxzh/)\n\n\n&gt; Afghanistan would be a Buddhist nation instead. It's hard to imagine isn't it? It wouldn't even be named Afghanistan. [+840]\n\nWell... perhaps one of the reasons it's so \"hard to imagine\" is because ***Afghanistan has never been a Buddhist nation in the first place?***\n\nThere was never a purely Buddhist nation/kingdom that covered all/most of Afghanistan? \n\nThe [Maurya Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire), the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), and the [Kushan empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire), \n\nBuddhism *was* a major religion in the region of Hindu Kush Mountain region yes, but it was practised alongside Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and Hellenism. It was never the sole religion there.\n\nAlso I'm really confused about where he got the \"It wouldn't even be named Afghanistan\" from. From what I read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_(ethnonym)) the term Afghan comes from a 3rd century Sassanian name of an eastern tribe called Abgân.\n\nThere was also mention of Afghans by Buddhists themselves:\n\n&gt; Hiven Tsiang, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim visiting the Afghanistan area several times between 630 and 644 CE, speaks about the native tribes inhabiting the region. According to scholars such as V. Minorsky, W.K. Frazier Tyler and M.C. Gillet, the word Afghan has appeared in the 982 Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam, where a reference is made to a village.\n\n&gt; \"Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain. In it live Afghans\"\n\nAnd considering *stan* means \"land of the\", it's not a stretch to say that's what they still probably would have called the country: \"Afgan - istan\"\n\nI mean, if you're going to get made about changing demographics, at least get mad over ***real demographics***. And considering this person has a TN flair, he/she should be the last person getting mad over countries violently changing religions. Along with every other person who lives in North America, South America, Australia, and/or various parts of European.\n\n* -\n\n&gt; The Crusades were in response to centuries of Islamic invasion, yes. [+164]\n\n&gt; You mean to tell me that within 100 years of its founding islam was laying seige to the heart of Christendom, and had already invaded all of northern Africa, Spain, the Levant, Iraq, and Persia? /s [+94]\n\n&gt; You mean to tell me after 20 generations of oppression under Muslims , white people fought back???? How dare Christians [+54]\n\n&gt; The Crusades was a fight against muslims. I'm glad they won. [+8]\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad we won too. [+5]\n\n&gt; At least the crusades were somewhat justified. They only recaptured land that was taken by Muslims. Islamic terrorism on the other hand, will NEVER be justified. [+42]\n\nWow! A subreddit talking about how \"uniquely\" violent Islam is brings up Crusade Apologitism. *Never* saw that one coming /s\n\nCrusader apologists have already covered extensively in this subreddit, so I won't be too big here, however I will ask anyone reading this to think back on the extensive \"Islamic invasions\" responsible for the:\n\n* Albigensian Crusade\n\n* Lithuanian Crusade\n\n* Livonian Crusade\n\n* Byzantine Crusade\n\n* Hussite Crusade\n\n* Prussian Crusade\n\n* Various other Baltic/Northern Crusades.\n\n**Oh yeah, there wasn't any.**\n\nAnyways, ~~Spain and~~ Persia wasn't a \"Christian nation\" that's a bunch of revisionist bullshit. ~~Spain was ruled by the Visigoths~~{1} and Persia by the Sassanids.\n\nIraq as a former Christian nation? [I don't think so](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1u7d9j/edl_member_iraq_was_originally_a_christian/)\n\nAnd the Crusaders clearly lost? They were successful in some of the early campaigns but overall Muslims keept them out of Jerusalem and Egypt for centuries.\n\nAlso, isn't the \"heart of Christendom\" St. Peter's Basilica? I've seen this phrase numerous times, but these people seem to be referring to something else? Because I sure am certain the Basilica was never \"taken by the Muslim horde\".\n\n* -\n\n&gt; Libs will point out arabic math in the 1200's, ignoring that we already had and forgot that math... So we can say fine, since the crusades, what good has Islam done? WWI? Yeah that kind of sucked. Armenian genocide? That sucked too. The truce that created two states, israel and Jordan that the palestinians immediately ignored and demanded that Israel be split again? Yeah not so good. I could go on, should I? [+42]\n\n[DAFUQ?](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F8t9TDi2xVnxOE/giphy.gif)\n\n*Yes*, PLEASE go on and and explain to me just how fucking ***WORLD*** **WAR ONE** was one of Islam's many contributions to human history. \n\nI can handle his mix-up on the years, I can handle his complete dismissal of the importance of Medieval Islamic contribution to European Mathematics, I can handle his faulty logic (hey genius, how exactly did you \"already have and forget\" mathematical concepts that Muslims had just developed [several centuries prior?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam) Wouldn't that still make Islam important?), I can handle his implication that both WW1 and the Armenian Genocide are purely Islam's fault, I can even handle his one-sided view of the Israeli conflict, but **what I can NOT handle is how utterly smug he fucking is**. **The fact that he is so confident, so damn proud, that what he just spewed on his keyboard is anything other than asinine bullshit makes me want to friggen fight an Oak tree**\n\n***AND 42 PEOPLE UPVOTED THIS***\n\nOh, and Islam's as much to blame for the Armenian ethnic cleansings as Christianity is to the Circassian Genocide.\n\n* -\n\n&gt; yeah... Islam hasn't done anything except kill people [+48]\n\n\n[yeah... seeing Islam is a theology which exists in a book and various oral traditions, is unable to do *anything*, much less kill people](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPB6gL95MEAeSEE/giphy.gif)\n\n* -\n\n&gt; Without Islam the ME would be Christian and peaceful [+24]\n\n\n[TIL: Without Islam one of the most religiously diverse and historically violent regions in the world would be completely \"Christian\" and \"peaceful\" ](https://dannimcgriffith.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/0769.png)\n\nByzantine vs. Sassanid wars no real.

It is written that it took over six months to burn all the scrolls. He destroyed all the texts by using them as kindling to burn the bathhouses in the city. He said, \"If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.\" [+34]\n\nMUH LIBRARY OF ALAXANDRIA\n\nThe library was literally in ruins before Islam became a thing.\n\nNo one knows exactly if the story with Caliph Omar is true, [seeing as it was written centuries after he died](http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-great-library-at-alexandria-was-destroyed-by-budget-1442659066)\n\n* -\n\n&gt; Japan has strict immigration laws against islam.

This is just straightforward ignorance\n\n* -\n\n&gt; I lived all my life without it. 9/11 was my only real direct exposure to 'Islam' Ban Islam. Ban Sharia. Exile Democrats. [+105]\n\nI believe you. Your comment is *exactly* what I'd expect from someone who's only view of Islam is through 9/11.\n\n* -\n\n&gt; Hell, the entire religious violence of islam started because their prophet went up to Jews in Mecca, tried to preach to them, the Jews said \"lol no\" and he got pissy about that.\n\n[Hmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEndTn5KfCg)\n\nI thought it started back when his followers were being beaten and killed for 15 years and they fled to another city to avoid being wiped out. Nvm, this clearly enlightened reddit comment is much more accurate than all those early Islamic chronicles! /s\n\nBesides, a number of prominent early Muslims were Jewish, like Abdullah ibn Salam for example.\n\n* -\n\nWell, that's enough for Muslims/Islam, get ready for the **really** weird shit I found within these pages.\n\n&gt; Fun Fact: Muhammad the prophet of Islam was white.\n\n**WHAT**\n\n&gt; Not surprised \nThese cracker Arabs are filthy and disgusting ﻿\n\n**STOP**\n\n&gt; thank you   i am leaving islam too after reading the bible.....i was brainwashed as a child  i see that now   jesus is the truth the way and the life...god bless you﻿ -Woman named Mary Viola\n\n**NO**\n\n\n* -\n\n(P.S.

        "author": "KamacrazyFukushima",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6ynuny/a_compleat_cartographicall_historie_of_yᵉ_world/",
        "text": "There's a [Youtube video currently at the top of r/history](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6yfr5m/the_history_of_the_world_every_year/) and boy oh boy is there a lot to say about it. I'm only going to address the things I can speak to; I'm certain others of you will be able to help me out. Starting off with the petty niggles:\n\n* Yes, a good deal of present-day Germany was \"Celtic\" at one point or another. Not as much as is shown in the video, and not as late. And I'm pretty certain that any Celts in modern-day southern Germany didn't suddenly become \"German\" right after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.\n* Starting from 500BC, the territories immediately to the east of the Germanic territories - a huge swath of land, stretching from about modern Kalingrad to the Western banks of the Volga - are labelled \"Iron Age Cultures.\" (Which Iron Age cultures, exactly, is left unspecified.) This state of affairs persists until 400AD, when is divided up into \"Balts\" and \"Finns,\" respectively. Meanwhile, Finland itself is unmarked. (Protip: there were Finns in Finland during the Iron Age.)\n* To its credit, the video distinguishes between East and West Germanic \"civilizations\" in the Migration Period. While I have no clue what exactly they mean by \"civilizations,\" the various groups identified by the maps *did* speak different languages - West Germanic including Old Saxon, Frisian, Old High German, etc., and East Germanic most prominently including Gothic. The map appears to label the Burgundians as a Western Germanic people. They weren't. (*At least per 19th-century scholarship, but apparently this isn't* necessarily *the point of view of the modern scholarship. Thanks /u/TimONeill*)\n* As the year ticks over into 500AD, the Scandinavian peninsula - previously blandly labelled \"Germans\" - is divided neatly in two, into \"Swedes\" and \"Norse.\" There is no reason to list this as having happened then. Norway was \"unified,\" per the literary tradition, under Harald Fairhair, somewhere between about 870 and 930. Norway was unified, per actual history, in fits and starts, with the process lasting until about 1240 with the close of the Norwegian civil wars. Sweden slowly coalesced as a single nation in the period between about 980 and, again, 1240. Or perhaps the mapmakers were thinking about \"Swedes\" and \"Norwegians\" as ethnicities? Well, 500 is a hella early time to make that distinction - East and West Norse didn't begin to diverge (as near we can tell) until somewhere around 800. If you squint at some of the saga (i.e. literary, not historical) material, you could make an argument for some kind of ethnic distinction being drawn around the year 1000 (one Swedish character tells his men not to be afraid of an opposing war party before the battle of Svolder, as they're only Norwegians.) On the other hand, modern Sweden was formed from two distinct peoples - Svear and Götar - who unified somewhere around the 11th century. The point I'm trying to make here is that the map is wrong on this account *by any criteria.*\n* The map has Iceland colonized in 860. It was colonized in ~~871~~ 874, per the literary record (a date which we have, happily, confirmed to within a few years, thanks to modern archaeology.) Unless the folks who made the map believe Ari fróði, author of *Íslendingabók,* who claimed that a handful of Irish-speaking folks were to be found there before the Norse colonization. (*N.B.: I don't think the folks who made the map believe this. I think they're just ignorant.*)\n* The map has Ireland and Scotland marked as \"Celtic\" from 900-*1651*, if you'd believe that. The process of Anglicization began much earlier than that; Scotland was a predominantly English (or Scots)-speaking country by the 14th century. [Per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic#Eclipse_of_Gaelic_in_Scotland): \"By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'\".\n* The legend marks Japanese, Korean and Mongolian as all being \"Altaic.\" Virtually no serious scholar has believed that in the past 50 years. It's a fringe theory.\n\nOkay, so there are some factual errors here. On the surface, none of it's *too* awful (well, with the possible exception of the Altaic thing. That one really is pretty bad.) I suspect that specialists in other regions and periods of the world would be able to point out similar such errors. But here's the rub:\n\n* The map never specifies what the divisions are meant to reflect. Are they cultural? You'd have a hard time pointing to the differences in \"culture\" between Swedes and Norwegians in 500. Linguistic? Where do you draw the line? I mean, they divide the Germanic languages into Eastern and Western, so points for that, but on the other hand just leave the North Germanic regions unshaded for a few hundred years, when in fact Proto-Germanic probably began to diverge into Northern, Eastern and Western at roughly the same time. So is the division \"ethnic?\" Ho, boy, is that a can of worms to open. There is no real scholarly consensus on how folks saw \"ethnicity\" in the Migration Age; suffice it to say that any attempt to read ethnicity is going to be fraught with uncertainty, and probably isn't worth making the effort. So do the divisions on the map reflect different \"civilizations?\"\n\nRegrettably, this is probably the intended answer. Which brings us to the real, *real* problem underlining this whole project:\n\n* Any attempt to divide the world into \"civilizations,\" using the same metric across the entire span of history, is going to be just... stupid. Just plain stupid. In the earliest period, you've got only archaeology (ie, clusters of material-cultural complexes) to go on - but chances are good that a proto-Germanic speaking farmer, living in Denmark somewhere around 500 AD, would consider himself to have very little in common with the equivalent guy in Sweden, though their lifestyles look substantially comparable to our eyes. Meanwhile, in the modern era, a Maine Yankee, a Hispanic Texan and a Hawaiian probably eat different food, live in very different dwellings, have dramatically different religious and political outlooks, and may not even speak the same language at home - but would certainly all identify themselves as \"Americans.\" So what's the criteria for determining what \"civilization\" the inhabitants of any given region, at any given time, pertained to? I'm going to boldly guess there really wasn't one.\n* And finally, the biggest problem of all... Take a look at the legend. The inhabited areas of the world are divided into \"homo sapiens,\" \"advanced cultures,\" \"embryonic civilizations\" and \"advanced civilizations.\" Human societies don't \"progress\" like a fucking tech tree in *Europa Universalis* or *Civ IV* or whatever. This kind of Whiggish approach is going to inherently colored by its author's biases: ridiculously reductive at best, outright racist at worst. This video has the great majority of the Americas, Africa and Austrialia populated by \"Homo Sapiens\" - not even \"advanced cultures,\" let alone \"embryonic civilizations\" - right up to the eve of European colonialism. Whether it is best considered reductive or outright racist is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need a drink.",

This one's gonna be really short since there's not much to discuss.\n\nI'm gonna primarily focus on the \"Picasso\" one, which is a blatant lie\n\n#1. Picasso didn't draw that\n\n[Doing a quick reverse image search yields us no results, other than the source seems to stem from /pol/ as a regular reaction pic. (I tried typing in Picasso to get more accurate results, as well](https://puu.sh/xsiVA.png)\n\nSecondly, I went to pablo-ruiz-picasso.net to look for the piece of artwork, but could literally not find it. At best, I found [Old Jew and a Boy](http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/work-31.php), which doesn't even resemble the suppposed Jew art at all, hell, it doesn't even seem like Picasso stereotyped the old Jew with a big nose and whatnot.\n\n[If you want the whole of picasso's works and look through them, just in case I probably missed it](http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/year.php?year=1889)\n\n#2. ~~There's literally no source for the other pictures~~\n\n**Source has been found by /u/Pseudohistorian [which is from some puzzle](https://enjoyourday.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/marriagejewishblackchinesepuzzle-zm-jpg/)**\n\n\nI did basic reverse image searching and they all seem to lead to the picture in question. [Victorian era also seems to be the case](https://puu.sh/xsjmN.png). I decided to give the 19th century one a chance, since I had a .PDF on Jewish caricatures by *Eduard Fuchs*. ~~I could not find the source of the caricature even there, even though the damn book is over 300 pages long with God knows how many caricatures.~~\n\n.\n\n[Book if anyone's interested](https://ia600301.us.archive.org/15/items/DieJudenInDerKarikatur/EduardFuchs-DieJudenInDerKarikatur1921.pdf) (Might take a while to load)\n\n# Well then if they ain't Jews, what are they depicting?\n\nThe problem I find is not what the caricatures are depicting, Jews being depicted as greedy has been a thing for a while in history, there were Jews who have been merchants (**not a lot, Jews primarily were farmers, thanks to /u/anonymousssss for clarifying**)  ~~It's where the source is from is what annoys me, and I literally can not find any source or caricature that uses them (The 19th century specifically).~~\n\n#Well what's the problem with these depictions?\n\nSomeone who doesn't check if these things (primarily Picasso) are actually real might come to the conclusion, \"huh, I think we're onto something\" and then shit might go downhill really, really fast. That or you're just gonna have misinformation spread that Picasso was an anti-semite or something, I don't know. As the saying goes \"No information is better than misinformation\".\n\n#What really interests me is, why would you even post these fake depictions such as Picasso, when there's a trillion real caricatures used throughout history?\n\n~~Regards to 2000BC I can't really say much, the first Jew (Abraham) was supposedly in 2000BC, however, when Abraham lived is a hotly debated topic among scholars, from what I've seen. For all we know that could not even be depicting a Jew, but some other ethnicity.~~ **Source has been found by /u/Pseudohistorian**, it is [**Eannatu, King of Lagash**](http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-mesopotamia-summer-archaic-dynasty-iii-king-eannatum-of-lagash-from-78768864.html)\n\n.\n\n\nComment: I've noticed most of my badhistory posts have to do with Jews or Germans, I might take a huge break from badhistory posting, or try and focus on some U.S stuff later on.\n\nComment #2: Seems like ancient history doesn't seem to be my specialty, I will stick to more modern eras (XVIIIth-Mid XXth century) in my future badhistory posts on which I've plenty of info to work with.\n",

I personally think it's revolting but you can judge for yourself\n\nWhere I live there is a brand of Kombucha called Aqua ViTea. I am not a doctor, so we will set aside all the medical effects this beverage claims to have, and instead we will just be looking at the historical claims on the bottle \n\n &gt;When villagers of an ancient Serbian culture could no longer afford tea, they looked to the forest for alternatives. What the birch tree provided became the legend of Kombucha\n\nlets pick this apart\n\n\n1. An 'Ancient Serbian' village who had access to tea, or that tea was  \n\n2. Ancient serbs existed \n\n3. that kombucha was created in the balkans or russia \n\n4. that birch trees are a ingredient in kombucha\n\nlet's look at claim one. Tea is widely agreed to of first been created in china at around 2000 BCE^1\n\nTea was widely imported to Russia in 1686^2 \nand first introduced to Italy in 1555^2\nAnd traded by the dutch in 1610^3\nall of these dates are firmly CE and while they are for a while ago clearly not ancient. So and ancient serbian clearly would not of had access to tea.\nSecondly at the time Tea was a luxury^2 \nitem so even if tea was in europe it is unlikely that said serbs would of ever been exposed to it as they were just peasants. \n\n\nClaim #2 If my knowledge of serbian history is correct Slavs firsts entered the balkans in the 6 and 7th century^4 5\n.\n\n\nI can not find any thing earlier besides a few legends, and perhaps a specialist could bring more light to the topic. But seems ‘a serbian’ would not of existed in ancient times. But yet again i really have no idea and may be wrong\n\n\nClaim #3 The origins of this pungent drink is shrouded in mystery. But yet again it seems to of oriaganted in china at around 220 BCE^6\n(I assume this took so long because most people throw out their tea when a thick microbial film forms on it.)\n\n\nIt seems China not Russia/Serbia were where the origins of kombucha lie.\n\n\nClaim #4 This is the most interesting claim. A certain type of mushroom grows on the birch tree, called Chaga, this very well may be a ingredient in many kombuchas i really don't know. The interesting part is that this a traditional folk medicine used in many northern european countries^7\n. this is made into a beverage resembling coffee or tea. Importantly Fermentation was not commonly used to prepare the beverage.\n\nIt seems this claim is correct\n\n\nTLDR: Kombucha was made in China not Europe\n\noh and by the way this is my first post\n\n\n1:http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Arts/7thingsabouttea/en/ch1_2_0.htm\n\n\n2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tea#Global_expansion\n\n\n3.http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Arts/7thingsabouttea/en/print_ch4.htm\n\n\n2\n\n\n4.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/a-cultural-history-of-serbia\n\n\n5.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_culture\n\n\n3\n\n\n6.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha#History\n\n\n4\n\n7.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inonotus_obliquus\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This particular piece of badhistory comes courtesy of *The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918* by Fanny Davis (1986). Due to a limited preview, I can't vouch for the overall quality of the book, which was published posthumously with support from the Institute for Turkish Studies.\n\nThe excerpt in question concerns the history of the Ottoman *kira*. These women, usually of Jewish origin, functioned as intermediaries and economic agents for ladies of the imperial household. Davis describes the illustrious life of a notable early *kira*, Esther, who served three Valide Sultans in a career that spanned nearly a century.\n\n&gt; The itinerant woman merchant had a long history in the Ottoman Empire. The term *kıra* goes back several centuries to a period when the best known of these merchants was a Jewish woman named Esther Kıra, an agent for Süleyman’s mother, Hafise Valide Sultan. In return for her services, Süleyman granted her and her heirs immunity from certain taxes. Her life and contact with the palace extended through the reigns of succeeding sultans into that of Mehmet III, when she became an agent of the unscrupulous *valide*, Safiye. She eventually became a Muslim and took the name of Fatma.\n\n&gt; In 1600 she was murdered by the *sipahis* (calvarymen) in front of the *konak* of the *kaymakam* as an act of vengeance against the *valide*, who was notorious for accepting bribes. There was also hostility against Esther Kıra because she was Jewish; for the Jews, together with *valides* Nurbanu and Safiye, were blamed by the military for the debasement of currency which made soldiers’ pay worthless.\n\nIt's a succinct but illustrative biography, with one problem... the 'Esther Kira' described by Davis isn't a single figure, but an amalgam of three prominent *kiras*: Strongilah (later Fatma), Esther Handali, and Esperanza Malchi.\n\nStrongilah was the first of the three figures to work in the Ottoman court. A Karaite Jew, she served Ayşe Hafsa Sultan, the *valide* of Süleyman I, and became one of her closest associates. Her career as *kira* probably began before his ascension to power, as upon his enthronement in 1520, Strongilah and her descendants were granted an exemption from taxes levied upon the non-Muslim populace in return for her service. Shortly before her death in 1548, Strongilah converted to Islam, adopting the name Fatma. Nevertheless, her Jewish descendants continued to enjoy the benefits proffered to her in the following centuries, with the exemption being reconfirmed at least six times between 1520 and 1868.\n\nEsther Handali gained prominence as the *kira* of Nurbanu Sultan, consort of Selim II and *valide* to Murad III, but her career in the palace began during the reign of Süleyman. Of Sephardic origin, Esther worked alongside her merchant husband Elijah, supplying goods to the imperial harem; after his death, she continued to work independently, and by 1569 came into the service of Nurbanu. As Nurbanu’s *kira*, Esther was more than economic intermediary; she assisted in diplomatic efforts, specifically relations with Venice. She corresponded on behalf of the *valide*, acted as a translator, and is suggested to have initiated contact between her mistress and the Venetian *bailo*.\n\nLetters exchanged between Safiye and Handali demonstrate an intimate friendship that lasted until the latter’s death in 1588:\n\n&gt; During the following years this *kira* continued to attend Safiye and protect the Jewish merchants going to Venice in whose favour she wrote many letters. On 10 September 1588 she fell ill even though she continued to see the baylo on behalf of the sultana. Safiye was very anxious about her health as a letter she wrote to Esther *kira* shows; in this text, expressions of friendship alternate with political considerations (“How are you?… Why didn’t you send your dish here to-day? Please, send it at the time of dinner every day… Why do the Venetians build castles near the border? Please tell them to destroy the castles or they know what will happen. The baylo sent a letter to have a *hatt-ı hümayun* but the sultan said that it has to be discussed in the *divan*”). At the end of November Esther Handali was so ill that she was not able to leave her bed. The sultana wrote to her every day for news of her health. She died on 18 or 19 December 1588, mourned by everybody (Pedani).\n\nIn addition to her economic and diplomatic activities, Esther was renowned for her philanthropy and charitable works. She used her connections and wealth to support the local Jewish community, provided for the needy, and was praised for her relief efforts following the 1569 great fire that swept through Istanbul. \n\nEsperanza Malchi was the last of the known sixteenth-century *kiras*, serving Nurbanu’s successor Safiye Sultan. Like Esther, Malchi acted as diplomatic intermediary. As Safiye’s agent she not only amassed a significant fortune, but gained overt influence in court politics. It was Malchi who, along with her son, was lynched by a mob in 1600. Their murder indeed took aim at the Valide Sultan, who had enriched the Malchis, spurred their rise to power, and proffered them control of the customs office.  \n\t\nThe circumstances of Malchi’s demise are described by Günhan Börekçi in \"Factions and Favorites\":\n\n&gt; The first major military uprising against Mehmed III, Safiye Sultan and Gazanfer Agha occurred in late March 1600, when the imperial cavalry soldiers, upon returning to Istanbul from the campaigns, discovered that a certain number of allotments for the *jizya* (the poll tax paid by non-Muslims) and the sheep tax, which they had expected to receive as part of their income, had been excluded from the salary distribution and instead sold to grandees at the court. They rose in revolt, demanding the execution of Esperanza Malchi, the Jewish merchant woman, known as a *kira*, who supplied merchandise to the harem and who was an important financial broker in court circles and a member of Safiye Sultan’s faction. Malchi had recently been assigned some lucrative tax-farm revenues, and the *sipahis* accused her of distributing their tax-farms to her own clients while at the same time holding her responsible for the debased coinage, which they argued came from her tax-farm payments. \n \nWithout denying the possibility of anti-Jewish sentiment among the perpetrators, it would be inaccurate to claim Esperanza Malchi was targeted simply “because she was Jewish”. She was targeted because she was one of the most prominent and powerful members of Safiye’s network of clients, who came under fire for corruption and favoritism. The soldiers had reportedly planned to also target Safiye’s other powerful “favorite”, Gazanfer Ağa, in 1600. Although these designs went unfulfilled, Gazanfer too met his demise three years later in another uprising. \n\nThe murder of Esperanza Malchi was but one event in greater context of an empire under pressure. The monetary crisis faced by the Ottomans at the close of the sixteenth century was compounded by two prolonged wars: one against the Celali rebels in Anatolia, and another against the Habsburgs in Europe. Lack of pay fueled discontent among the soldiers who fought in these lengthy conflicts without sufficient provisions. Furthermore, the government devalued the currency to cope with the difference between revenues and expenditures. It was these circumstances that spurred a series of military uprisings, including the one that led to the death of Malchi.\n\n(For more detailed reading on this topic, the first chapter of Börekçi’s excellent treatise on factionalism at the courts of Mehmed III and Ahmed I provides a thorough overview of how financial instability and martial unrest led to the uprisings of 1600-03; I couldn’t recommend it more.)\n\n*The Ottoman Lady* is the first work I’ve encountered to make such an error concerning the three *kiras*, but it is apparently not unique in this regard. The conflation of the three figures into a singular entity is frequent enough to warrant a brief mention in a couple scholarly sources. Minna Rozen's *History of the Jewish Community in Istanbul* (2002) notes the confusion and surmises that “the three women created one imaginary, diabolic personality” because of their shared title or the lack of knowledge on the deaths of Strongilah and Esther.\n\nAn earlier article by S.A. Skilliter – published four years before *The Ottoman Lady* and prior to Davis’ death – also acknowledges this common historiographical error. Skilliter states that J.H. Mordtmann’s 1929 publication of a document concerning Strongilah finally “untangled the knot” of the three *kiras*; nevertheless, as exemplified in *The Ottoman Lady* the singular ‘Esther Kira’ narrative continued to persist in some degree.\n\nWith this in mind, I find it more likely that Davis was simply echoing the erroneous analysis of other historians in her ‘Esther’ biography, given her studies focus on a later era.\n\n-----\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Börekçi, Günhan. \"Factions and Favorites at the Courts of Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603-17) and His Immediate Predecessors\" (2010).\n\n* Lamdan, Ruth. \"Jewish Women as Providers in the Generations Following the Expulsion from Spain\". *Nashim* 13 (2007).\n\n* Pedani, Maria Pia. “Safiye’s Household and Venetian Diplomacy”. *Turcica* 32 (2000).\n\n* Peirce, Leslie. *The Imperial Harem* (1993).\n\n* Rozen, Minna. *A History of the Jewish Community in Istanbul: the formative years, 1453-1566* (2002).\n\n* Skilliter, S.A. “The letters of the Venetian ‘Sultana’ Nur Banu and her Kira to Venice”. *Studia Turcologica* 19 (1982).\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6xmn7k/european_history_textbook_on_the_ottomans/",
        "text": "Ottoman historians of the 17th century often complain that scholars of European history consistently fail to provide accurate accounts of Ottoman history whenever they try to include the Ottomans in their narrative. This is, in my experience, quite true, but it's also hard to blame them, as there is no modern, comprehensive general history of the Ottoman seventeenth century which could effectively communicate to them the results of new research. We (finally) have some good general histories - Caroline Finkel's *Osman's Dream* (2005) and Douglas Howard's new textbook *A History of the Ottoman Empire* (2017), but neither of these quite fulfill the role needed here of something akin to what Donald Quataert did for the nineteenth century in *The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922* (2000), of providing students with a roadmap for studying the period. I get the impression that European historians are left not quite knowing where they should look.\n\nSo today I'll look at one modern textbook, *Early Modern Europe 1450-1789* by Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks, part of the Cambridge History of Europe series and published in the second edition in 2013, which covers the Ottomans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on pages 347-8, to see how it's gone astray. I'm not going to criticize it for what it leaves out of the story, only the problems with what it includes.\n\n&gt; In theory, Ottoman sultans were absolute monarchs, appointing local leaders, making political decisions, and directing the army and navy. In practice, as the empire grew, more of the day-to-day administration was handled by officials, under the leadership of a grand vizier, a position that became heritable. The sultans themselves rarely left their extensive palaces, where they were surrounded by wives, concubines, servants, and officials who followed elaborate rituals in their interactions with the ruler. Complex protocol also marked Louis XIV's court at Versailles, but Louis personally oversaw political and military affairs, whereas most sultans did not, growing ever more distant from the realities of their subjects' lives.\n\nSo aside from the bizarre note about the office of grand vizier being heritable, nothing in this paragraph is wrong *per se*. It's true that the empire's administration did change in a way that reduced the direct participation of the sultan in government. But it's an awfully simplistic interpretation - one which characterizes a massive swath of history with a single broad brush. Power was polycentric and ever-shifting during the seventeenth century. Several sultans were active in ruling the empire in the traditional way (e.g. Osman II, Murad IV, Mustafa II) while those who weren't never entirely left the political field, they simply adopted new techniques better suited to rule from the palace. In the 20th century much was made of the supposed negative impact of sultans abandoning their position at the head of the army and instead remaining in Istanbul. Historians now generally interpret this as the expected result of the empire's expansion and bureaucratization, not a degeneration of the Ottomans' original values.\n\n&gt; The death of every sultan was followed by intrigue and often warfare among claimants to the throne, with each faction backed by powerful Janissaries and officials, and by their mothers.\n\nThis is an accurate description of the sixteenth century, but not the seventeenth and eighteenth. Once princes were confined to the palace, there could be no more warfare over the throne. Succession (as well as deposition of a reigning sultan) was generally decided by consensus among the power-holders in Istanbul, whoever they happened to be, with a particularly important role going to the chief religious official, the *Şeyhülislam*, who legitimized the process, and of course the *Valide Sultan*.\n\n&gt; Much of the Ottoman Mediterranean fleet was destroyed by a combined fleet of European powers at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Though the fleet was rebuilt within a year, and the Ottomans took Tunis in North Africa from the Spanish in 1574, they no longer dominated trade in the Mediterranean, but shared it with Venetian and later Dutch and English merchants.\n\nPeople sure love to ascribe strange significance to the Battle of Lepanto. The Ottomans never dominated Mediterranean trade to begin with, from the beginning of the sixteenth century it was largely in Venetian hands, with the French, English, and Dutch (in that order) coming in from the middle of the sixteenth to the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. It had nothing to do with the Battle of Lepanto, because Ottoman naval power in the Mediterranean wasn't what determined trading patterns.\n\n&gt; On land, Ottoman armies were split between fighting the Safavid Empire in Persia to the east and maintaining their hold in Europe. The collapse of the Safavids in the seventeenth century allowed the Ottomans to turn their attention fully to Europe,\n\nThe Safavids collapsed in the eighteenth century, what allowed the Ottomans to turn to warfare in Europe was that they simply made peace with the Safavids. When the Safavids finally did collapse, it actually led to renewed Ottoman warfare in the east.\n\nNow here's where Wiesner-Hanks' account really runs into problems:\n\n&gt; The Ottomans besieged Vienna in 1683, but German and Polish armies rescued the city, and then continued to push the Ottomans out of most of Hungary and Transylvania. Despite these losses, Janissaries and other officials who dominated the Ottoman court blocked political, military, or economic reforms: tax revenues declined, and agricultural and technological innovations adopted elsewhere were not adopted. The huge bureaucracy needed to run the enormous empire became increasingly corrupt, with local officials regarding the provinces under their authority as territories to be exploited rather than parts of a whole.\n\nHad to fit the decline thesis in there somewhere.\n\nActually, following the loss at Vienna, the exact opposite happened. The Ottomans implemented comprehensive fiscal reforms in order to raise revenue for the war. Most significantly, this meant reforming *cizye/jizya* collection methods, issuing new forms of tax farms, and purging the Janissary payrolls, as well as some other changes like the legalization and taxation of the sale of tobacco. The Ottomans came out of the War of the Holy League with budget surpluses unlike anything they'd had during the seventeenth century. Far from declining revenues, Ottoman income exploded from around 600 million akçe per year to 1 billion, and continued to grow with the expansion of the economy during the early eighteenth century to 1.6 billion in 1748. But apparently the author needed to identify some moment as the grand turning point before listing off the stereotypes of decline. \n\nOn the nature of central power in the 17th century:\n\n* Fodor, Pál. “Sultan, Imperial Council, Grand Vizier: Changes in the Ottoman Ruling Elite and the Formation of the Grand Vizieral ‘Telḫīṣ.’” *Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae* 47 (1994): 67-85.\n* Karateke, Hakan T. \"'On the tranquility and repose of the sultan': the construction of a *topos*.\" In *The Ottoman World*, edited by Christine Woodhead, 116-29.

The reported height of the lamp above lake level is 12 or 13 feet off, but that’s about it.\n\nWell, so long as you skip past the first half of the article,  with the same boilerplate paragraphs about the French cartographers who couldn’t count past twelve, and the steamboats puffing all over Lake Superior fifty years before the Soo locks opened, and all that.\n\nSince it doesn't feel right to conclude this series with such a sparse entry, I'll offer remaining readers compensation in the form of two quick episodes from the history of the Apostles' northernmost lighthouse,  unrelated to the *boatnerd* series: \n\n[Devils Island Keeper’s Dwelling—nice, huh?](http://i.imgur.com/kp5aPYi.jpg)\n\nStory 1: On a stormy evening at the end of September 1939, keeper James Bard’s 16-year-old daughter Marjorie fell down the stairs in their house while scrubbing the floor, breaking her hip. Knowing there was a Coast Guard cutter in the general vicinity, he radioed for help, but his call  never reached the vessel. It was picked up at the Coast Guard base at Duluth, however, and two Coast Guardsmen set out at 9 PM in an open boat for the 65-mile trip through high seas to her aid. Shortly before the two men arrived, the cutter finally caught the transmission, and beat them to the island. \n\nWith only one suitable landing place under the prevailing sea conditions, it was necessary to carry Marjorie on a bedspring one mile down a forest trail to the boat that would take her to medical attention on the mainland. She survived the ordeal, but required several months of rehabilitation, and walked with a limp for the rest of her life. Her father received a transfer to another light station during her convalescence, so she never returned to Devils Island until 60 years later when the National Park Service arranged to bring her back for a visit.\n\nStory 2: Since Lake Superior shipping comes to a halt when the lake ices over, it was customary (with some exceptions) for the lighthouse keepers to close their stations just ahead of freeze-up, and return to the mainland for the winter. In the earliest years, the keepers were on their own to make their way in, but by the beginning of the 20th century, government vessels would pick them up at the end of the season.\n\nIn 1919, a sudden hard freeze prevented the lighthouse tender \"Marigold\" from reaching Devils Island, so on December 18, Keeper Frank Marshall and Assistant Keeper Justus Luick gave up waiting and walked their way home over the ice, a trip of twenty-two miles that took them more than eight hours.\n\nOkay, now I feel better. \n\nTime to  wrap up our trip with a visit to the red-headed stepchild of the Apostles, Gull Island. \n\n[Gull Island Article, no author listed](http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Superior/Gull%20Island.htm)\n\n[Photo: the lonely Gull Island tower](http://i.imgur.com/p1n4fcL.jpg)\n\nThe smallest of the bunch by far, Gull Island is a barren acre of rock and sand, marked by an industrial-style tower devoid of any charm. The island only takes on interest when you delve into its history: the damn thing is a ship-eating monster. From 1865 to 1929, when the government finally got around to putting up the light, nearly a dozen ships came to grief on Gull Island and the nearby shoals. Once finally put into service, the automated lamp was maintained by the keepers of the nearby Michigan Island light, until that station too was vacated in 1943.\n\nA late arrival, without resident keepers of its own, and nondescript in appearance, the Gull Island beacon is usually given short shrift in treatments of the Apostles lights. The *boatnerd* series follows this pattern, offering a bare-bones table of date and location and two short paragraphs of text. True to form, in less than a hundred words, there are two mistakes.\n\nFirst, the table:  \n\n&gt; Location: Off Michigan Island in Lake Superior; Date Built: 1928\n\nLocation correct, date off by a year. Now the text:\n\n&gt;A light was first proposed for this location in 1906…\n\nOff by more than forty years. Gen. Joseph Totten, of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  chairman pro tem of the Lighthouse Board,  recommended purchase of Gull Island “for lighthouse purposes” in a letter to Commissioner J.M. Edwards of the General Lands Office, dated Nov. 24, 1863. The well-known Great Lakes maritime engineer Gen. Orlando Poe renewed the request in 1871. It’s too bad no one listened to them; it might have saved a few ships and a life or two. \n\nThus ends our inspection of boatnerd.com’s guide to the Apostle Islands lighthouses-- thanks for sticking with me! I’m still slack-jawed not just at the number of blunders crammed into these articles, but also by their variety of subject and scale. Some show ignorance of basic regional history, like the distorted chronology of the French presence on Madeline Island, or the posh summer colonies that show up the better part of a century too soon. In contrast, many of the details offered regarding the individual lighthouses seem to suggest that Mr. Wobser did at least some background reading, but just couldn’t keep the information straight. Did he lose his notebook and try to reconstruct everything from memory? \n\nAnd then there’s that imaginary 1868 Chequamegon Point lighthouse, and I can’t begin to guess where he got *that* from. \n\nAspiring authors are often advised, “Write about the things you know.” These articles remind us that a corollary is equally important: “Stay away from subjects you don’t know very much about.”\n\n---\n\n\n**General List of Sources**\n\n**Books**\n\nDanziger, Edmund Jefferson, Jr. *The Chippewas of Lake Superior*.

The light provided a guide for down-bound vessels into the western channel along the Bayfield Peninsula to the towns of Bayfield, Washburn and Ashland.\n\nUnborn Washburn again! But only two years premature this time, so we’re getting better, and we’ll let this go by.\n\n&gt;Some period furniture is in the dwelling, including an original USLHS traveling library.\n\nEvery stick of furniture in the building is modern, and the library box is another one of the 1997 replicas.\n\n&gt;A Fourth Order polygonal Fresnel lens with 10 sides was placed in the tower, and produced a light 56 feet above Lake Superior.\n\nA misunderstanding of lighthouse terminology seems to be at work here. Mr. Wobser is apparently confusing Sand Island’s ten-sided, fourth-order polygonal *lantern* -- the windowed chamber at the top of the tower holding the navigational beacon--  with the fourth-order, *four*-sided Fresnel lens housed within it.  The Lighthouse Board’s practice of classing both into “orders” adds to the confusion.\n\n[Sand Island Lighthouse Fresnel lens c. 1925-30](http://i.imgur.com/i26raJh.jpg)\n\n\"A boathouse and breakwater were built 1500 feet south of the lighthouse in a small cove off Lighthouse Bay. These were destroyed in during (sic) a storm in 1905 and were not replaced.\" \n\nThe boathouse was damaged in the November 1905 storm, but it was repaired. The keeper's log frequently mentions the boathouse in subsequent years, and there are photographs showing it standing in the 1920s.\n\n[The Sand Island boathouse, c. 1925-30](http://i.imgur.com/aOLGjvO.jpg)\n\n&gt;Only two keepers served at Sand Island. Charles Lederle was part of the construction crew that built the lighthouse and served as keeper from 1881 to 1892. He was succeeded by Emmanuel Luick who served until (t)he light was assigned to Raspberry Island in 1920. In 1933 the light was fully automated.\n\nMr. Wobser has the keepers’ names right, but then things go out of whack again. The Sand Island lighthouse was “fully automated” in 1921 by means of the Dalén sun valve, a clever contraption that used a magnifying lens to focus the sun’s rays on a thermostat doo-hickey. The sun goes down, the gizmo cools off, opens the fuel supply and light goes on. Sun comes back up, gizmo shuts everything down and saves gas. People were so impressed by this that they gave Gustav Dalén the 1912 Nobel prize for inventing it. Really.\n\nUnfortunately, the gadget was kind of finicky, with the pilot light always blowing out and stuff, so every night the keepers of the nearby Raspberry Island light had to walk a mile to the north tip of their island and look across to Sand Island. If the lamp was out, they had to get in their boat and go fix it. \n\nWhat *did* happen in 1933 was that the Lighthouse Service built an ugly steel tower in front of the lighthouse, and put a new and improved acetylene lamp  at the top. They got rid of the old Fresnel lens while they were at it; such a pain to keep those things clean. \n\n[Handsome Lighthouse with Ugly 1933 Tower](http://i.imgur.com/3QPoSEh.jpg)\n\n&gt;Keepers had the company of as many as 100 people who lived in the small village of Shaw, which was located on the eastern bay of the island. The town was abandoned in 1944, but remnants of the town remain not far from the National Park Service dock.\n\nOh, *please!*\n\nSand Island did in fact have a small year-round community, but there was no such place as “the village of Shaw.” \n\nThe island’s peak population was probably closer to 75 than 100, primarily immigrant Norwegian fishing families, arriving from about 1890 onward. Their homes and farms clustered along a bay on the island’s eastern shore, a settlement that everyone called-- wait for it—East Bay. The fishermens’ sons and daughters started drifting away in the 1930s, and the last three year-round families moved to winter homes on the mainland in 1944, though for a long time afterward, many would return to the island once fishing season began.\n\nSo what’s with the “Shaw” business? \n\nSand Island’s best-known early settler was a Civil War veteran named Frank Shaw, and the site of his homestead at the island’s southeast corner, about a mile from the East Bay settlement, came to be known as Shaw Point. In 1911, Frank’s son-in-law Burt Hill became postmaster of the island’s brand-new post office—a shed down by his dock---  and chose to name it in the old man’s honor. The post office shut down after only five years, and with that,  the name “Shaw, Wisconsin,” which no one ever used except on envelopes, died a quick death.\n\n[Burt Hill’s dock with the post office in the center](http://i.imgur.com/P9SSXNU.jpg)\n\n&gt;Beginning in 1925, the Sand Island lighthouse dwelling was leased to private individuals for use as a summer home. This continued until the island was purchased as part of the Apostle Island National Lakeshore in 1970. \n\nOff by half a decade. When the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was established in 1970, the lighthouse tract was already owned by the U.S. Forest Service. (Long story for another day.) It took another five years before the two agencies arranged the swap-- a conveyance without exchange of funds, not a purchase-- and the last private occupant of the lighthouse maintained his lease until then.\n\nLast installment coming up tomorrow!\n\n[Ahead to Part 6: The Devils and Gull Island Lights](https://redd.it/6wyyjl)\n\n**Sources**\n\nAdministrative files, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Bayfield, Wisconsin.\n\nAnnual reports of U.S. Lighthouse Establishment.

The *Boatnerd* article on this site varies slightly from the pattern, with four introductory paragraphs by one Colt Ledin preceding the reprinted *Great Laker* article. Let’s see if Mr. Ledin does better than his colleague:\n\n&gt;This is one of the few surviving wood framed lighthouses left on Lake Superior. It was built in 1863 to mark the west channel through the Apostle Islands….  The light was extinguished in 1957 but has been maintained since then by the National Park Service who keeps the station open for tours.\n\nSigh…\n\nFirst of all, to be picky, the light was built in 1862, and then placed in service the following spring. I’d overlook this if not for what comes next: the light was absolutely *not* extinguished in 1957. The Raspberry Island station was automated in 1947, but the lamp remained in the tower. Then, in 1957, the Fresnel lens was removed from the historic tower and a modernized beacon placed atop a metal pole on the bluff out in front, where it still shines today. Moreover, the National Park Service had nothing to do with Raspberry Island until years later: the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was not established until 1970 and only took title to the lighthouse in 1975.  In the interim, an architectural firm from the Twin Cities leased the structure from the Coast Guard and used it as a corporate retreat.\n\nMr. Wobser takes over from here:\n\n&gt;An original USLHS traveling library is on display\n\nThe Raspberry Island lighthouse is the only one of the Apostle Island lights restored to give an authentic lived-in appearance with appropriate furnishings. Among these is a “traveling library” of the sort the Lighthouse Service provided keepers and their families – sturdy wooden cases containing an assortment of books, exchanged for fresh material every six months or so. What you will see at Raspberry Island is  a nicely-done replica,  one of a half-dozen put together in 1996 by high school shop students from White Bear Lake, Minnesota. (Source: I worked with the kids.)\n\n&gt;The original tramway leading up from the boat dock remains, and a rare tram cart is located at the top.\n\nThe original wooden tramway was built in 1902 and replaced by the current concrete structure in 1932. The tram cart is modern.\n\n&gt;Restoration of the dwelling interior is an on-going project by NPS volunteers… The grounds are well maintained, including a vegetable garden and a number of flower beds that have been designed to replicate a 1920’s photo of the station... National Park Service volunteer keepers are on the island during the summer months and the Annual Celebration.\n\nThese statements are wrong about the staffing, and drastically misrepresent the nature and scope of the 2005-2007 restoration of the lighthouse structure, interior, and grounds. \n\nFirst of all, the heavily visited Raspberry Island lighthouse is the only one in the park staffed by actual National Park Service employees, not volunteer guides. Second, the restoration was not done by well-meaning volunteers poring over an old photograph or two. The planning that went into the project included top-to-bottom examination of the buildings by historic architects and structural engineers,  analysis of scores of historic blueprints and photos,  archival research in keepers’ logbooks and other administrative records, interviews with surviving lighthouse family members, and more. The job was primarily carried out by professional contractors working under general NPS supervision. (Thank you, Congressman Dave Obey, for funding all this.)\n\nWe’ve got time and the lake is calm today, so let’s travel to the farthest corner of the archipelago.\n\n[Outer Island Light by Dave Wobser](http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Superior/OuterIsland.htm)\n\n[Photo: Outer Island Lighthouse](http://i.imgur.com/EuRrAiY.jpg)\n\n&gt;As traffic increased between the Soo and Duluth-Superior in the later part of the 1800's, a light was built on Outer Island which is the most northeastern of the Apostles. Put in operation in October, 1874 the light was a welcome aid to the growing vessel traffic carrying ore, lumber and grain between Duluth-Superior and the lower lakes…\n\nGood so far, but,\n\n&gt;A tramway that was built in 1874 to haul goods from the boat landing was washed away in the first year of the station's operation. It was replaced in 1884.\n\nOff by a year; the rebuild was done in 1883. The station logbook and the agency’s annual reports pin it down.\n\n&gt; The fog signal was a locomotive whistle with coal fired boiler to produce steam.\n\nNope. The fog signal worked *on the same principle* as a locomotive whistle, but it was considerably larger than anything you’d find on a train.\n\n&gt;In… 1925, the steam fog whistle was converted to an air diaphone run by air compressors and diesel engines.\n\nOff by four years; it was 1929. The keeper’s log gives us the exact date: October 31, 1929, “Air signal in commission.\"\n\nI find myself wondering, “Where is this guy getting all these almost-but-not-quite-correct dates?”\n\n[Ahead to Part 5: The Sand Island Lighthouse](https://redd.it/6wr8kt)\n\n**Sources**\n\nAnnual reports of U.S. Lighthouse Establishment.

It is presumed, though not yet conclusively documented, that officials in Washington were unhappy with their field representative Abraham Smolk’s unilateral revisions to the plans, and insisted on placement of a light at the proper site. Somewhat confusingly, it was referred to as the La Pointe light, in reference to the harbor it was built to mark, on neighboring Madeline Island.\n\nMr. Wobser gets quite a bit wrong in his article on this lighthouse and the two later built to replace it.\n\n&gt; Long Island is in reality a disconnected piece of land at the end of Chequamegon Point..\n\nA look at an up-to-date map would have prevented a painful boner here. While a shallow, “now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t” channel has separated Long Island from the rest of Wisconsin on and off over the years, the so-called island has been connected to the mainland since 1975, when the “Edmund Fitzgerald” storm filled in the cut thoroughly enough to hold since then.\n\n[Photo: The First La Pointe Lighthouse](http://i.imgur.com/GZN0BeP.jpg)\n\n&gt;The first light, built in 1858, was a wooden platform that displayed the light through a Fourth Order lens. An attached clapboard dwelling was later constructed but only the foundation remains. \n\nI can’t imagine where Mr. Wobser got this idea of a beacon sitting by itself on a bare wooden platform. Where, pray tell, was the keeper supposed to stay on the barren sandbar before someone got around to building him a house? In fact, it’s quite clear that the original, schoolhouse-style lighthouse was built in one piece. Among other references,  a letter written in 1863 by keeper D.J. Cooper complains, “The house also needs painting, it has not been painted since the season it was built (1858).”\n\nIn 1897, the original La Pointe lighthouse was replaced by two new towers, roughly three-quarters of a mile apart: the “New La Pointe” tower, east of the original lighthouse, and the Chequamegon Point tower at the island’s tip. One keeper, with two assistants, was responsible for both lights.\n\n[Postcard Image: The New La Pointe Lighthouse and Fog Signal Building](http://i.imgur.com/XqcftLZ.jpg)\n\nTurning to the New La Pointe tower:\n\n&gt; The present white steel tubular structure, supported by four skeletal legs, was erected in 1896…  adjacent to the 1890 fog signal building.\n\nOff by a year on both buildings. Construction of the light tower was begun in the fall of 1896, but the crew was called away to work elsewhere at the end of October. Work was not resumed until the following August, and the new tower finally placed in service  on October 11, 1897.  Work on the fog signal began in October 1890, but was not complete until early the following year.  \n\n&gt;Two structures are adjacent to the tower. One is a rectangular frame building, sided with corrugated iron, that was erected… to house a fog signal.\n\nSorry to break the news, but the Coast Guard demolished that building in 1986. Please try to keep up.\n\nNow, we’ll trudge through the sand to the tip of Long Island, where we come to the:\n\n[Chequamegon Point Light by Dave Wobser](http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Superior/chequamegonpoint.htm)\n\n[Photo: The Chequamegon Point Lighthouse and Its Modern Replacement](http://i.imgur.com/8cEG53k.jpg)\n\nOr alternatively,\n\n&gt;CHEQUAMENON POINT (1868) 1896\n\nOkay, typos happen. Many of us fix them when they show up in headers.\n\n&gt;The original Chequamegon Light was established on the western end of Long Island in 1868 to mark the entrance to Chequamegon Bay... It was replaced in 1896 by a square, white steel room on steel legs. \n\nOh. My. God.\n\nSAY WHAT?\n\nWhere in the world did this 1868 lighthouse come from? \n\nIf I had to pick a low point in this swamp of misinformation, it would probably be here, where Mr. Wobser makes up a lighthouse that never existed.\n\nThere is absolutely no record of a lighthouse built here in 1868. \n\n*Zero, zip, zilch.* \n\nNot in the reports and correspondence of the Lighthouse Board, not in any keepers’ log books, not in letters or diaries or news reports of the day. In fact, what we do have are land records showing that the government only bought the site from a private owner in 1895, in order to build a lighthouse on it. \n\nThe one that was completed in 1897, *not* 1896, and whose upper portion is made out of cast iron, not steel.\n\n&gt;These two lights are located about one mile from the La Pointe Light. \n\n“Two lights?” Huh? Now I’m really confused. Is he talking about the one that never existed and the one that was built a year later than when he thought it was, or is he… never mind, screw it. Let’s just go on.\n\n&gt; Access is by walking from the dock at the La Pointe station along the beach. At one time, a boardwalk connected the two lights, and early light keepers rode bicycles from the La Pointe station to tend the Chequamegon Point light.\n\nThe image of keepers riding bicycles back and forth on the concrete sidewalk (*not* boardwalk) between the two towers may be charming, but I am unaware of any evidence that it actually happened. The surviving volumes of the keeper’s log, which cover the years 1872 to 1943 and include considerable detail about daily life at the station, make no reference to a bicycle, nor is there mention of bicycles in any of several interviews with keepers’ children conducted in the 1980s. Perhaps Mr. Wobser has access to other sources of information than these; if so I hope he will share them with the rest of us.\n\nStay tuned, there’s more.\n\n[Ahead to Part 4: The Raspberry and Outer Island Lights](https://redd.it/6wjpll)\n\n\n**Sources**\n\nAnnual reports of U.S. Lighthouse Establishment.

        "text": "When a specialized web site gets it all wrong about a place you know well: continuing an examination of the series of articles on the lighthouses of the Apostle Islands appearing on the maritime web site, [boatnerd.com](http://www.boatnerd.com).\n\n[Part 1]( https://redd.it/6vyuv3)\n\n[Map: The Apostle Islands Light Stations] (http://imgur.com/a/WkpXr)\n\nThanks for the interest in my initial post on this topic. Let’s turn from the general regional history repeated verbatim on all but one page of the Boatnerd articles to the information presented on the individual lighthouses, beginning with the oldest.\n\n[The Michigan Island Lights, by Dave Wobser](http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Superior/MichiganIsland.htm)\n\n[Postcard view: the first Michigan Island Lighthouse](http://i.imgur.com/ckaps9Y.jpg)\n\n&gt;Michigan Island has the distinction of having the first and last lighthouses constructed in the Apostle Islands. Both are still standing. This island’s lighthouses marked the eastern edge of the island chain for vessels heading to Ashland to load iron ore from the Gogebic Range.\n\nMisleading: the mines of the Gogebic Range did not begin production until 1884, nearly three decades after the construction of the original Michigan Island lighthouse, and Ashland’s first ore dock came two years after that. The initial intended purpose of the beacon was to guide ships to the harbor at La Pointe, the old fur trade post on Madeline Island.\n\n&gt;Interestingly, there was no authorization for the light and it only operated for one shipping season. It is thought that the light was to have been constructed on Long Island, but the mistake was not discovered until completion of the Michigan Island light.\n\nThe story of the Michigan Island lighthouse is indeed a puzzler, but the writer is presenting an outdated hypothesis here. The placement of the lighthouse at a spot different from the one originally intended was not a simple mistake, but the result of a deliberate change of plans authorized by a government official.\n\nIn 1854, the U.S. Lighthouse Board issued a contract to the Milwaukee construction firm of Sweet, Ransom, and Smith to build eleven lighthouses on the “Northwest Lakes.” Among them was to be a beacon at the tip of “Chagwamegon Point,” the skinny sandbar now known as Long Island, to guide traffic to La Pointe, the old fur trade village which was still the only substantial settlement in the region. A light there (point A on map) would make an excellent signpost to the La Pointe harbor, which sits on the landward side of Madeline Island, hidden from the open lake.\n\n[Map: The Great Michigan Island Mystery](http://i.imgur.com/EJ2eoFf.png)\n\nInstead, when the job was finished in the fall of 1856, the brand-new lighthouse blazed from atop a bluff on Michigan Island  (point B on map), seventeen miles from its intended location. For many years, no explanation could be found for this discrepancy, and the most common guess was that somewhere along the line, due perhaps to a vaguely written contract or faulty communication between headquarters and the field, somebody screwed up and put the lighthouse on the wrong island.\n\nHowever,  documents unearthed in the late 1990s showed that the location change was not a mistake or misunderstanding, but was done by order of the  Lighthouse Board’s representative on the scene. One Abraham Smolk, “Superintendent of Lighthouse Building on Lake Superior,” ordered on-the-fly revisions to the omnibus contract for three of the eleven planned lighthouses, the La Pointe light among them. Contractor Alanson Sweet grudgingly acceded, but later filed claims for the extra costs incurred due to the change orders. It is his carefully documented expense vouchers that eventually solved the Michigan Island mystery. They do not explain Smolk’s reasoning, but it is noteworthy that two of his three revisions moved the beacon from lake level to a clifftop, and this writer suspects he may have been overly concerned with the elevation factor.\n\nThough not a literal “mistake,” Smolk’s decision was definitely unwise. As Wobser correctly notes, the Michigan Island lighthouse was shuttered after its first season of operation, then relit in 1869. Unfortunately, on the bluff where it was built, the lighthouse was hidden from mariners until they were well along on their course and already past an area of hazardous shoals. Several ships ran aground here as a result, but fortunately only two lives were lost in the wrecks. \n\nAfter years of dithering, the Lighthouse Service finally addressed this problem by erecting a much taller tower on the site. The boatnerd.com description of the second beacon contains one glaring gaffe and a minor, misleading bit of sloppy writing.\n\n[Photo: the second Michigan Island tower](http://i.imgur.com/2Aixe7D.jpg)\n\n&gt;The structure is similar in design to towers at Rawley Point on Lake Michigan and Whitefish Point at the east end of Lake Superior. The Michigan Island tower differs in that a small brick building is located at the base of the center cylindrical tube and inside the six legs that support the structure. \n\nWrong. The little entrance house at the base of the tower is cast iron like the rest of the structure. Go knock on it some day.\n\n&gt; This building apparently served as a workroom for the early keepers.\n\nThe “early keepers” never set foot in the building. Only the station’s last two keepers even saw it.\n\nComing up in my next post:  some real howlers about the three lighthouses on Long Island.

        "text": "When a specialized web site gets it all wrong about a place you know well…\n\nIf you like lighthouses— and a lot of folks do— there’s no better place to visit than the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior. Six light stations on the archipelago off the northern tip of Wisconsin contain a total of nine historic towers and the ruins of a tenth, comprising what maritime historian  F. Ross Holland called, “the largest and finest single collection of lighthouses in the country.\"\n\n[Map: The Apostle Islands Light Stations] (http://imgur.com/a/WkpXr)\n\nAs a park ranger at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (now happily retired), I’ve grown accustomed to bumping up against bad information on the history of the lighthouses and the surrounding Chequamegon Bay region, sometimes in news items or travel articles, sometimes in the patter of kayak guides and tour boat captains. Though I considered myself pretty jaded by now, my eyes opened wide when I recently visited the popular Great Lakes maritime website, [boatnerd.com] (http://www.boatnerd.com), and came across a series of articles that makes a good claim for the title of “The largest collection of lighthouse misinformation in one place.” \n\nBoatnerd is generally regarded as a reliable and comprehensive source for information on the ships that ply the Lakes, with vessel histories, photo galleries, news of arrivals and departures, and much more. However, there is also a section on “Lighthouses of the Great Lakes,”  which, if its treatment of the Apostle Islands lights is an indication, should be taken with at least a year’s production from the salt mines beneath Lake Erie.\n\nThis series of articles, written by a gentleman named Dave Wobser, originally appeared in a magazine named *Great Laker*, whose URL now redirects to a publication called *Great Lakes Seaway Review*. They  follow a rigid pattern with minimal deviation: ten cut-and-paste paragraphs of historical background and tourist information; then finally some details on the individual lighthouse. The articles are riddled with errors large and small, from dates off by a year or two, to some painful mutilation of Lake Superior 101.  \n\nI’ll examine the cookie-cutter intro sections first, using the Michigan Island Lighthouse page as an exemplar, then turn to the material about individual lighthouses in posts to follow. \n\nhttp://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Superior/MichiganIsland.htm\n\n    \n    \nLet’s start with the basics, as Mr. Wobser sees them:\n\n&gt;A total of six light stations were established on the Apostle Islands between 1857 and 1891. They are Michigan Island (1857), La Pointe (1858), Raspberry Island (1863), Chequamegon Point (1868) Outer Island (1874), Sand Island (1881) and Devils Island (1891).\n\nThat makes seven. \n\nOkay, math is hard. We get that. But here’s the thing: the Chequamegon Point beacon (which was *not* built in 1868—we’ll get to that in good time) was considered part of the La Pointe light station, and tended by the same keepers who looked after the “New La Pointe” tower just up the beach. \n\n    \n    \nNow, to the early years:\n\n&gt;The Apostle's (sic) originally received their name because early French explorers mapped only twelve islands. \n\nUnlikely. It’s true that a French map of 1744 refers to the chain as *Iles des 12 Apôtres* – “Islands of the Twelve Apostles,” but by that point the cluster of 22 islands  had been known to the French for more than 80 years, and it’s close to unthinkable that they were under the misapprehension at that late date of there being only a dozen. It is much more likely that the early French explorers, following a longtime tradition of bestowing religious names on geographic features, decided to lump the scattering of look-alike islands under one convenient group heading.\n\n    \n     \n&gt;The French had established a major fur trading post in the islands from about 1660 to 1840. \n\nWhoa, there! The trapper-explorers Radisson and des Groseillers did show up in the Chequamegon region in 1659, but their visit was brief, and after conflicts with government officials upon their return to Montréal, the pair turned their attention elsewhere. A handful of unlicensed traders followed their footsteps over the next few years, but it was not until 1693 that an actual “trading post\"  was constructed near the modern village of La Pointe on Madeline Island. This establishment was short-lived, however, perhaps a victim of its own success: in 1696, responding to a glut of furs flooding the market, King Louis XIV revoked its license, and the post was abandoned after only three years. \n\nIt was not until 1718 that stability was achieved with the opening of a second post on the island.  This one continued operation until the outbreak of the French and Indian War, but in 1762, the French garrison fled the site and three years later the triumphant British destroyed the abandoned structure. While fur trade did continue as an important part of the local economy for some time to come, it did so under the control of British, and then American, authorities. So much for that “major French trading post from 1660 to 1840.”  \n \n    \n    \n&gt;Much of their trading was with the Chippewa (Ojibway) Indians who had lived in the area since the 1400’s.\n\nThe Chequamegon Bay region is considered the homeland of the Ojibway people, and the story of their arrival here is a subject of particular cultural sensitivity. William Warren, the son of a Yankee fur trader and an Ojibway mother, was the first to set the tribe’s traditional account down on paper. Writing around 1850, he recounted a tale of migration, beginning on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, then progressing westward in stages through the Great Lakes. Warren attempted to date the tribe’s arrival at Chequamegon by counting backwards by generations, and using a generous figure of 40 years per generation, came up with a date of 1492. (*Ta-da!*)\n\nIt would take several pages to discuss the complex and compelling history of the Ojibway and the other Native people who have occupied the area. Suffice it to say here that while Warren’s work is still considered a treasure-house of information, most modern scholars support the general outline of the traditional migration account, but move the chronology a century or more closer to the present.\n \n    \n    \n&gt;Tourism and trips to summer homes of the wealthy had been established by steamers in the early 1800’s…\n\nHardly. The Chequamegon region was not even open to white settlers until the Treaty of La Pointe in 1854, much less posh summer homes. Steamers on Gitche Gumee were rare as hen's teeth before the 1855 opening of the Soo locks that allowed boats to bypass the rapids separating Lakes Superior and Huron. The first to be recorded on the big lake was the propeller *Independence*, laboriously hauled overland around the Sault Ste. Marie rapids in 1845. Tourism took off gradually once the locks made access practical for ships large enough to provide reasonably comfortable passage to Lake Superior ports, but the regional summer home tradition is generally considered to begin with the establishment of “Nebraska Row” on Madeline Island in the 1890s.\n \n    \n    \n&gt;About the same time (as the opening of the locks), the towns of Bayfield, Washburn and Ashland were developing into shipping ports.\n\nWashburn was not established until nearly thirty years later, in 1883.\n \n    \n    \nIn addition to these blatant errors, there are several misleading or exaggerated statements regarding the islands’ logging, quarrying, and commercial fishing industries; bad information on current opportunities for camping; and some just plain carelessness: the National Lakeshore headquarters is on Washington *Avenue,* not Washington *Street.* But no sense beating a dead horse.  \n\nTomorrow, if there's interest, I’ll commence a closer look at the misinformation offered on the individual lighthouses. \n\n[Ahead to Part 2: The Michigan Island Lights](https://redd.it/6w5fsq)\n\n \n    \n    \n**Sources**\n\nBusch, Jane C. *People and Places: a Human History of the Apostle Islands – Historic Resource Study of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore*.

        "text": "Greetings!\n\nNow, I was reading through the tumblr of one of my ...politically radical acquaintances, when I'd spotted something they'd reblogged. As to both not have them spammed, and to meet with the rules as far as I understand them, I'll merely quote the offending passages below: \n\n\n&gt;the death tally for communism is all just a part of the american propaganda machine. i’m sure you’ve heard of holodomor, a famine that killed an estimated 10 million people. absolutely horrific, i don’t deny it. but have you heard of the us’s trade blockade? you see, during that time the us blocked the ussr from exporting anything but grain. because they couldn’t use gold to buy machinery, they took a gamble and hoped the next harvest would be good. it wasn’t. the government tried anything to rectify it, even implemented a countrywide rationing of the food but it didn’t help. america did not lift their blockade and millions died yet it is considered solely communism’s fault.\n\n\nProps, I suppose, for admitting that the famine occurred and that it's not merely fascist/imperialistic/capitalistic/whoeverIdon'tlikeistic lies. \n\nWhat isn't good, however, is the implication that the famine was a byproduct of capitalism. Putting the whole argument of whether the USSR was communist, or was merely an authoritarian socialist dictatorship to one side, the whole idea of it being the fault of capitalist societies is rather perplexing.\n\n\nThe idea that ' the us blocked the ussr from exporting anything but grain', from what I can find, seems to be based on the arguments of Nikolai Starikov. A man whose recent career seems focused on rehabilitating Stalin. Hardly one whose sudden claims of Western involvement in the USSR's shame I'd take too seriously...\n\nI can't, however, find any evidence of a American (or British for that matter) blockade upon the Soviet union in the 1930s. In the 1910s and 20s, certainly, with the blockades and western refusal to take Soviet gold being disastrous for the early soviet state.  But by the 1930s? I've found little evidence of the blockade continuing, or of Soviet gold being rejected by western powers. (If there is any, feel free to correct me).\n\nConsidering how one of the many gulag camps set up in the period, such as Kolyma, focused in both lumber production and gold mining, combined with the lack of any evidence of a continued embargo does leave the poster's claims in doubt. Focusing on extracting gold, when no one will accept it would have been rather strange, to say the least.\n\n\nMore so than the fact that gold continued to be extracted, a look at the figures (taken from *The Development of the Soviet Economic System* by Alexander Baykov, page 275), shows that grain was not the Stalinist state's only export.  Raw materials and semi-manufactured goods accounted for 53.5% of total exports in 1932 and 58.1% in 1933 and Manufactured goods were 24% of total exports in 1932 and 22.9% in 1933. This is compared to a mere 22.5% of total exports by foodstuffs in 1932 and 19% in 1933.\n\nI'll refrain from touching the claim that the Soviets were merely 'gambling on the next harvest', both due to the lack of sources I have on hand, and due to the fact that the nature of the famine/circumstances that lead to the famine has previously been covered in this sub, [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1w6b9j/til_that_the_holodomor_is_actually_genocide/) and [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1w6b9j/til_that_the_holodomor_is_actually_genocide/).  \n\nAnd on r/askhistorians, as usual, doing a far better job of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/536qpy/stalin_seems_to_get_lots_of_blame_for_the/)\n\n\n**Sources** (I'll admit, these aren't grand.

        "text": "My grandmother had mentioned hearing that Henry 1 died during a solar eclipse to me in passing today, so I went on Wikipedia to remind myself who Henry was. As an avid fan of *Pillars of the Earth*, re-reading about Henry's death and the bloody Anarchy that followed was entertaining, but I didn't see anything about a solar eclipse in the article. All it mentioned was the story about the lampreys and the fact that Henry died on December 1st, 1135. I then went to NASA's website to see if they had anything about it and it turns out they do. On the [Eclipse Misconceptions](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/eclipse-misconceptions) page is this short blurb about the belief that solar eclipses are bad omens \n\n&gt; Total solar eclipses are not often recorded in the historical record, but they do tend to be recorded when they coincide with other historical events. For example in 763 B.C., early Assyrian records mention an eclipse in the same passage as an insurrection in the city of Ashur, now known as Qal'at Sherqat in Iraq, suggesting that the ancient people linked the two in their minds. **Or when King Henry I of England, the son of William the Conqueror, died in A.D. 1133, the event coincided with a total solar eclipse.** With a little work you can also find numerous cases when something good happened!\n\nSpotted the problem yet? NASA says Henry's death 'coincided' with a total solar eclipse in 1133, but he didn't die until 1135. Now I was puzzled, somebody has to be wrong here unless Henry died twice. First I verified the date of Henry's death with the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/henry_i_king.shtml) and [Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-I-king-of-England) just to make sure I wasn't going off bad information. Then I considered maybe a NASA intern just made a typo, putting **1133** instead of **1135**, but that left the question of how such a story could start in the first place. I needed to know if an eclipse actually did coincide with Henry's death, so I went back to NASA for more answers.\n\nSeveral links sent me back to the same 2017eclipse page they had set up, which didn't contain historical eclipse maps. Finally, I found a site called Hermit Eclipse, which contains an easy to search a database of eclipses going back all the way to 2000 BCE. The site pulls all its data from NASA as far as I can tell, including the maps of the paths of the eclipses. After narrowing into the [1120-1141](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/lists/solcat/1121) period, I saw that yes, in fact, there was a total solar eclipse in [1135](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1135_07_12), but there was also one in [1133](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1133_08_02). Problem is, BOTH are on the wrong date!!! And, if you look at the maps, you can see that while the 1133 eclipse is perfectly centered on Northern Europe, the 1135 eclipse was only visible to some penguins and kiwis in the South Pacific. \n\nSo we arrive back at the question of who is right. Either we have an extra 2 years and 5 months in Henry's life, or NASA saw something I didn't see. One possibility that I think may explain this error is a  [January 5th, 1136](http://moonblink.info/Eclipse/eclipse/1136_01_05) that was visible in Europe, but this certainly isn't a **\"total solar eclipse\"** as claimed by NASA. \n\nI emailed a shorter version of this to NASA, and will update if I hear back from them. \n\nA more entertaining possibility is that Henry died in 1133, but was raised from death by the power of the eclipse, only to succumb to the lampreys in 1135, but I think we can discount this possibility. Everyone knows only the Night King can raise the dead, the solar eclipse was just how the Ogdru Jahad planned to enter our world.",

        "author": "kmbl654",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6uvvsq/the_native_americans_were_backward_savages/",
        "text": "[Video in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGK9KHUnaaQ)\n\nI think there is certainly an argument to whether the Europeans were more advanced than societies in the Americas specifically militarily but Crowder really likes to push the idea that Native American society had a 30 IQ average to whitewash how bad colonization was. Combine this lack of respect for historical fact with the unfunny scenes where he dresses up as an Indian and you get a really stupid video.\n\n* 0:15 Apparently having a negative view on the colonization of the Americas is something for only social justice warriors\n\n* 0:47 Not exactly sure if it's ok to simply simplify a centuries long period of eradication as \"The clash of civilizations\" especially if you take into account how one-sided, brutal, and racially driven the entire series of conflicts were\n\n* 2:00 Crowder references the Aztec Empire and Cortes yet constantly refers to the Native Americans as having a horseback culture that many of us think of as the Plains Indians\n\n* 2:17 Crowder says that the main strategy of the Europeans was to arm other Indigenous populations and let them kill each other. While this happened in some cases I'm fairly certain this wasn't an overarching strategy for most instances of conflict with the natives. Cortes is referenced as an example which isn't necessarily bad history, but when you characterize all of the later conflicts in the same nature as the fall of the Aztec Empire, you get problems. Columbus's interactions with the Taino comes to mind where he did exactly the opposite by actively enslaving or killing nearly the entire population with a force that consisted of Europeans. And I doubt the USA used the arming of enemy tribes to enforce the Trail of Tears or the Nez Perce War.\n\n* 2:30 He says that cannibalism was practice among some Indian tribes as an example to justify that Native Americans were brutal. Yet if we focus on North America, which Crowder seems to do, [we find that a vast majority didn't practice it](http://www.native-languages.org/iaq13.htm)\n\n\n* 2:40 \"Scalping was invented by the Native Americans\" While Native Americans did independently invent scalping, Europeans also did the same. [Herodotus](https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3269235.pdf.bannered.pdf) (Beginning of page 9) notes the Scythians in modern Russia/Ukraine as scalping their enemies and even using them as napkins or sewing them all together for cloaks. Another example comes from the [Abingdon manuscript](https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html) (Line 1036) in which Harold Godwinson of England scalped his enemies after a battle against Danes.\n\n* 3:00 \"Native Americans were not even close to an advanced society\" This is the real badhistory meat of the video and I find it frankly insulting that Crowder thinks this is the case.\n\n* 3:21 If you're going to cherry-pick technologies that Native Americans didn't have, at least pick technologies that they actually didn't have\n\n **Plumbing**\nI don't know how hard it is to google search things for Crowder, there's a small section on Mesoamerica on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_water_supply_and_sanitation#Classic_and_Early_Modern_Mesoamerica) for plumbing that explains how early Mesoamerican civilizations had flushable toilets\n\n **Transportation**\nAgain I'm not sure where Crowder is getting his sources, literally all you have to do is google search these terms and you can come up with plenty of examples within Native American societies. Who does he think popularized the canoe (Of which up to [3000 lbs](http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.tra.001) could have been carried in for some) or snowshoes? And if you want more grandiose forms of transportation innovations look at the [Incan road system](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1459) which let people traverse nearly 25,000 miles of the Andes on foot with runners that could do over 200 km in a day. Sure the horse might have been faster than what the indigenous had, but it's not like these societies didn't bother to improve their transportation systems.\n\n **Mathematics**\nIt's like he's not even trying anymore. I'm pretty sure a lot of people have heard of the Mayan calendar which was in part due to their [advanced mathematical systems](http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/civil/maya/mmc05eng.shtml) that in turn allowed for an incredible understanding of astronomy.\n\n* 3:39 \"The horse-back culture of the Native Americans was a lie because they hadn't domesticated horses before Columbus arrived\" Oh come on... I don't think I have to explain this one. I think I will add the fact that Incan Civilization domesticated the animals they actually had, like the llama.\n\n* 3:41 \"They didn't use the wheel\" First of all, they had the wheel [mostly on toys](http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/ca52db8bf567.jpg), and secondly, they didn't need it because they didn't have any draft animals to begin with, not because they were a bunch of savage idiots. This point in particular gets to me because the \"[source]\n(https://www.quora.com/Why-were-the-indigenous-peoples-of-the-Americas-not-able-to-invent-the-wheel)\" he used from Quora says the exact same thing I did, yet it seems that he didn't even read it.\n\n* 4:11 \"Europeans did not attempt to infect Native Americans with smallpox blankets\" I don't really know what this has to do with Crowder's broader argument, but he doesn't even get this fact right. Just GOOGLE \"smallpox blankets\" and you will get the [source](http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/excerptsfromwilliamtrent.pdf) from a European author (William Trent's Diary) in the Siege of Fort Pitt that describes such.\n&gt;  Out of our regard to them we gave them two Blankets and a Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect. \n\n     Also, I don't think you need to have complex understanding of germ theory to realize that the blankets used by smallpox patients in a smallpox hospital, would probably spread smallpox. Crowder is however right that they weren't mass distributed by Europeans to the natives, but this did happen.\n\n* 5:11 While disease killed off the majority of the natives, the ones left were subject to extreme mistreatment. Native American slavery killed off much of the Incans and those living under Spanish rule (Mita system) while forced relocation often led to the eradication of many North American societies (Trail of Tears/Relocation Policy, causes to King Phillip's War, etc...). Another example is that of Columbus to the Taino people, while disease killed many on Hispaniola, those that were alive were subject to forced enslavement by bringing quotas of resources (Mainly gold) and were maimed or killed if they failed to do so.\n\n* 5:47 Not at all uncommon you say? Really? I implore anyone to find a similar situation in which over 90% of the indigenous population on two continents were wiped out. And the only remotely similar situations I can think of would have to be the other places that Europeans colonized, namely in Africa and India, both of which were notoriously brutal.\n\n* 5:51 Sure maybe they weren't hellbent on extermination in the sense that Nazism wanted to eradicate the Jews, but when [90% of a population dies out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas#Population_overview) and mass amounts of enslavement occur along with the racial justifications that followed, it sure seems like the European colonists didn't give a shit if not actively benefited from what was happening. Again the mass amounts of relocation within the US also shows the deliberate attempts at cultural genocide that don't simply include death itself.\n\n* 5:56 Sure conversions were encouraged, but many of these weren't modern day conversions of consensual nature that we think of today. The [capture of the Incan emperor Atahualpa\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cajamarca) comes to mind in which Pizarro demanded the Atahualpa convert under the authority of Charles V, and when he refused possibly due to interpretation errors, the Spaniards ambushed and captured him. Crowder also doesn't mention how religion was the justification for taking the New World in the [Spanish *Requerimiento*](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/amerbegin/contact/text7/requirement.pdf) in which those who did not convert through embracing Christianity and submitting to Spanish rule would either be killed or forced to do so.\n\n &gt; I certify to\nyou that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter into your\ncountry, and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we\ncan, and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and\nof their Highnesses; we shall take you and your wives and your children,\nand shall make slaves of them, and as such shall sell and dispose of them\nas their Highnesses may command; and we shall take away your goods,\nand shall do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as to vassals\nwho do not obey, and refuse to receive their lord, and resist and\ncontradict him; and we protest that the deaths and losses which shall\naccrue from this are your fault, and not that of their Highnesses, or ours,\nnor of these cavaliers who come with us.\n\nThe rest of the video is Crowder summarizing and concluding that once contact has been made between two technologically different civilizations, then conflict is bound to happen, which massively oversimplifies the situation and glosses over just how cruel colonization was to the Native Americans.",

To add insult to injury he pronounces the Taíno (tah-EE-noh) people without the accent (tai-NOH). \n\n\"But 40kfreak!\" You cry, tears streaming down your cheeks at the idea of a TruTV show not performing its due diligence, \"The common misconception in the US is that Colombus never went to the US, which is true!\"\n\nAlso wrong, please note [this](https://youtu.be/3MJoKhO9G1g?t=141) 15-second segment where he lists *modern day* countries Colombus visited of which \"none of them were in the United States.\" As he lists them the modern state is highlighted in green, but when he says \"the Dominican Republic\" the small island east of the DR is highlighted in green too. That island is called [Puerto Rico](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html), and it's not part of the Dominican Republic, its been part of the United States for over 100 years. Colombus visited Puerto Rico during his second voyage in 1493, its even in their fucking [national anthem](https://youtu.be/fgtyCF4lqfk?t=62). Writing off Puerto Rico as part of the Dominican Republic is either the laziest research in the world or a deliberate attempt to avoid saying Colombus visited the modern United States. Adam *could* have said \"continental United States\" and been correct, but that would've taken precious time away from the bits!\n\nSo no, Adam is misleading you when he says that Colombus didn't visit \"America\" and misleading you further when he says Colombus didn't visit the United States. Now you might say that this is all semantics and technicalities, after all we often say \"America\" to mean the United States and Adam *obviously* meant only the continental United States. Except the whole premise of *Adam Ruins Everything* is that it's the TV equivalent of [ACKCHYUALLY](http://i.imgur.com/DpQ9YJl.png). It's a show ostensibly designed to avoid getting \"the gist of it\" in favor of being as accurate as possible. To avoid talking about how \"America\" is more than the US and how Puerto Rico is currently part of the US isn't really honest to the show's premise, and forces the audience to question how much of the show is designed to make Adam *look* right rather than *be* right. \n\n\"But 40kfreak! surely this show and its creator doesn't claim to be incredibly accurate and thoroughly researched right?\" [Weeeeeeelll....](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6ppg26/hi_im_adam_conover_the_creator_and_host_of_adam/dkr6p86/)\n\n\n\nedit: I left a sentence hangi-",

        "text": "So here it is. The finale of this terrible series, so far its bad history has exceeded my expectations but the worst is yet to come. You can find [Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6sge8w/hallmarks_cleopatra_1998_50_shades_of_pedantry/) and [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6tnhcn/hallmarks_cleopatra_part_2_days_of_our_lives_of/) if you missed them.\n\n2:04:00 Antony had lost control of his legions in Gaul after the Perusine War, years before the Final War of the Roman Republic.\n\n2:05:00 The idea that Marc Antony was only involved in the Final War of the Roman Republic because he loved Cleopatra has to be one of the most successful half-baked claims of all time.\n\n2:05:38 Wait, that is Olympias? That guy was a physician not a politician and the only things we know he advised Cleopatra on were her health and, later on, how to commit suicide while on suicide watch.\n\n2:06:38 Octavian did not immediately start assassinating Antony's lieutenants after the Donations of Alexandria, his attacks were of a political nature and unlike what this series presents many of Antony's generals defected to Octavian for their own reasons.\n\n2:06:49 I am not sure what to say at this point, I mean I could never complain enough about Cleopatra's costuming but seriously why the tripartite braid? Why the ultra anachronistic crown here? This looks like if someone tried to make an Old Kingdom Egyptian inspired armour set for Halloween. \n\nAlso way to gloss over the political battle between Antony and Octavian and jump straight to open war. Worst of all, it ignores the lead up until Actium which makes it appear as though both sides fought one battle at full strength and that was it. The slow but steady advance of Agrippa against Antony's position, the defection of Quintus Dellius with Antony and Cleopatra's plans, and the general reality that they were already losing is completely lost. I mean, this is no worse than reducing the Liberators' War or the Alexandrine civil wars to one battle but it is up there.\n\n2:08:13 That admiral is *still* Ardeth the Medjai from the *Mummy* series by the way. Not bad history but I never knew he was in this.\n\n2:09:10 Apparently Antony and Cleopatra had not unlocked ranged combat skills yet and therefore could not craft any kind of ballistae to counter Octavian's ranged assault. They were forced to rely on dramatic stares until their ships were close enough for boarding.\n\nHistorically their ships were unable to inflict serious damage on Octavian's because of their superior speed and maneuverability, but this was not for lack of trying as they apparently rained a multitude of projectiles upon them.\n\nNot to mention that Octavian begins his assault in this scene by bombarding flaming projectiles at them from a goodly range when historically he at first used the advantage of his swifter, more agile and well armoured ships to close on Antony's ship and make repeated close range attacks by ramming and then pulling back before an adequate counterattack could be dealt. He resorted to burning the ships towards the end of the originally indecisive conflict and after the Egyptian contingent had broken off, meaning Cleopatra's flagship would not have been in danger of burning as it is here.\n\nBeyond this, the role of the fire and the overall course of the battle is different here than in reality. Both sides crash into each other and then remain locked in a constant struggle while fires and projectiles swiftly sink the vessels, whereas historically Antony's ships maintained a defensive stance against Octavian's swift assaults. The fire came into play later and it apparently killed sailors faster than it sank ships, in addition to the individual vessels becoming easier to board or sink in the discord following Cleopatra's flight. There were in fact concerted efforts to combat the fire by using water, cloth and possibly corpses to put out the flames, and although these were mostly unsuccessful it still took time for the entire fleet to be destroyed. Dio reports that men were suffocated by smoke, roasted, or baked in their armour while some jumped into the sea or tried to tear off their armour, all of which are very different from the explosive and swift destruction of vessels we see here and were offset by boardings and ranged attacks (arrows, stones, etc).\n\n2:10:05 Agrippa gets zero credit for this victory, Octavian is the centrepiece of Antony's opposition which is just messed up. Every time it zooms in on his face or he reveals his master plan I get ticked off.\n\n2:10:52 Look, no. Just fucking no. This scene has the Egyptian naval forces being directly assaulted by Octavian's ships before Cleopatra's flagship is bombarded and boarded but the worst part is that Cleopatra then has to single handedly dispatch a Roman soldier with a sword.\n\nThe problem is that Cleopatra fled the battle when the tide turned against Antony and most of the Egyptian forces followed her. This is actually often seen as being a contingency plan of Antony and Cleopatra from the beginning when it became clear that they could not maintain a protracted conflict with Agrippa but even if it was a spontaneous decision it removed Cleopatra from the immediate danger and her flagship survived.\n\nBeyond this, there is absolutely no reason to think that Cleopatra was skilled at hand to hand combat despite what this series implies. There are no ancient accounts praising her martial skills and the closest thing to personal combat that she probably got was either hunting or watching others fight. There is also no reason why she *needs* to have been able to fight to be a strong individual, she was a politically active ruler, an intellectually talented individual, and she was respected for her naval experience which were all uncommon pursuits for women in her lifetime. The only physical descriptions of her imply that she was slight, and as an aristocratic woman accustomed to luxury with no known training it is exceedingly unlikely that she was particularly talented in martial combat. I would not be complaining except that she also killed an Egyptian cavalry officer in the first part, making this a recurring theme of this mini series. Not everyone has to be a warrior to be a fighter, and just because a character is strong-willed and does not \"fear the dagger as a woman should\" to quote Horace they do not automatically have to become a soldierly type. \n\nPlus shoehorning in scenes like this make it harder for female fighters of a more literal kind to get the credit they deserve, like her ancestor Berenike II or her supposedly descendant Zenobia of Palmyra both of whom actually participated in combat.\n\n2:11:11 [sighs] More sword combat with Cleopatra.\n\n2:11:44 Antony fled his flagship, he did not fall into the water as the ship sunk and he actually disengaged to pursue Cleopatra after she turned to flee the battle. He apparently swapped his flagship out for a smaller vessel so that he might better escape.\n\n2:12:58 Cleopatra's decision to falsely present Actium as a victory in Egypt and Alexandria was in order to prevent strife and panic while allowing her to pour resources into the now dire war without raising too many alarm bells or facing serious domestic resistance, not merely to save face because honestly, how long would that last?\n\nAlso Antony eventually caught up to and boarded Cleopatra's vessel, and they arrived in Alexandria together although apparently with some serious distance between them metaphorically speaking.\n\n2:13:28 Cleopatra is her own rap battle hype man with those hand gestures \n\n2:14:24 Can I just offer up my lack of respect for this \"Antony is dead\" fake out plot device?\n\n2:16:10 Antony and Cleopatra actually had some grievances with each other following Actium both as a result of their actions during the battle and those made afterwards. This extended from their initial refusal to speak to each other during their flight to the mutual distrust between them right up until Antony's protracted suicide. My point is, this tense reunion played out long before they reached Alexandria and according to Plutarch Cleopatra's ladies-in-waiting attempted to bring them together again *during* the defeated return to Alexandria by first arranging a parley and then for them to talk, eat and sleep together.\n\n2:17:04 There is no reason to think that Antony took particular offense at Cleopatra's decision to deceive the Alexandrians, in fact he took no steps to prevent this and even assisted in providing them with festivals, acting as gymnasiarch, planning possible defenses and handling the rites of passage for his son Marcus Antyllus and Caesarion, both of whom entered the military to set the example for other families. It is true that he was initially angered but this apparently had more to do with Cleopatra abandoning him and his own newfound misanthropy.\n\nAlso at this point when Antony yet again mentions how he is not Caesar I want to point out that there is no reason to suspect that this was a point of contention in their relationship. To be sure her relationship to Caesar remained politically and perhaps personally important to her right up until she died but this does not necessarily mean that she wanted Antony to be Caesar or that Antony's resentment of being constantly held up against Caesar's example was a major sticking point between them. \n\n2:25:19 Cleopatra tells Antony that when she dies her tomb will be sealed tight, no doubt to differentiate it from other Egyptian tombs which were open air parks. \n\n2:25:40 It is implied here that Cleopatra was planning to assassinate Antony with a knife but historically she planned to sacrifice him either with poison or manipulating him into suicide.\n\n2:31:30 Antony's defense of Alexandria was successful at first, but by that point in the war he was unable to realistically carry on a war against Octavian and subsequent mutinies halted a planned counterattack against Octavian.\n\n2:32:43 Caesarion is a child in this scene but he ought to be around 17. And where are Cleopatra's three other children or Antony's son Marcus Antyllus? \n\n2:33:55 Olympias did not accompany Caesarion in his flight to India, a tutor named Rhodon did while Olympias remained in Alexandria and assisted Cleopatra in her attempts at suicide.\n\n2:34:45 Cleopatra did not remain in Alexandria because she was waiting for Marc Antony, it is entirely plausible that she betrayed him to his death, she waited because she hoped to reach some kind of settlement with Octavian and for her children by Antony to be spared and inherit the kingdom.\n\n2:38:10 Antony was not mortally wounded in battle, he tried to fall on his sword after hearing reports of Cleopatra's capture and suicide and ended up giving himself a slow but fatal abdominal wound. He was also not brought into the mausoleum by its doors but had to be lifted up on ropes and pulled in through the window because Cleopatra feared that his lieutenants had traitorous intentions.\n\nHe apparently lived for a bit longer than in this scene as he had time to advise Cleopatra that she ought to look to make peace with Octavian and to have a drink of wine according to Plutarch. \n\n2:40:20 Octavian did not pound on the doors to Cleopatra's mausoleum, he sent lieutenants to convince her to surrender herself and that she and her children would be considered more leniently. According to Plutarch this was mainly accomplished by Proculejeus who also prevented her from cutting her throat so that she might be captured. But it is also quite likely that Cleopatra still held out hope that she convince Octavian to treat her more favorably in defeat and not conquer Egypt.\n\n2:42:48 Octavian did not tell her outright that he intended to display her in his triumph but implied that he would allow her or her children to retain the throne and threatened to have all her children executed if she committed suicide which was much more effective than the argument portrayed here where he just says \"*I have won Cleopatra, and you will come to Rome.*\" \n\nIt was only after she discovered his true intentions that she committed suicide if we believe the Roman accounts, and this was some time after Antony died.\n\n2:44:47 Corpse kissing.\n\n2:45:00 Antony is thought to have been cremated and Cleopatra paid her final respects before committing suicide by placing flowers on his urn, pouring libations and kissing it. Wrapping his body in a sheet without even properly eviscerating and embalming his corpse does not even sound like \"the Egyptian fashion\" either, even if he *were* mummified I like to think Cleopatra would have shelled out for an actual embalmer.\n\n2:44:35 That awkward moment when you can not tell if you are hearing a terrible reconstruction of ancient Egyptian or the actors adlibbing whatever they think sounds about right.\n\n2:45:15 Cleopatra was *overtly* under suicide watch by this point, had already made more than one attempt and had agreed not to starve herself after Octavian threatened to send her children to meet her afterwards. This scene of Rufio trying to deceptively prevent her from self harm does not make much sense.\n\n2:47:00 Cleopatra supposedly got rid of Octavian's guard by convincing them to deliver a sealed tablet to Octavian which was actually a suicide note, not by asking for space to pray and then locking them out as in this scene. Roman accounts state that by the time the guard arrived she was already dead. She also committed suicide in her chambers *after* visiting Antony's burial and her own funerary arrangements were looked after by Octavian.\n\n2:49:28 The accounts that claim she died by the bite of an asp state that it bit her on the *arm*, the idea that she was bitten on the breast comes from the Middle Ages, no doubt because of some bored writer/historian. Still, this series will continue to promote this annoying little detail.\n\n2:49:53 Octavian discovered Cleopatra's suicide after reading her letter not because of a commotion caused by Rufio breaking into her mausoleum as in this scene. Beyond that, Rufio was not the man who was said to have failed in guarding her, it was a freedman named Epaphroditus.\n\n2:51:00 Cleopatra's last words here are apparently a weather report.\n\n2:51:27 Charmian and Iras were said to have committed suicide by drinking poison or by pricking their arms with poison needles, not by using the same serpent as Cleopatra which only makes sense because snakes do not have enough venom to kill three fully grown adults in one sitting, certainly not instantly.\n\n2:52:00 Iras was supposedly adjusting Cleopatra's diadem before falling dead when the guards walked in and Charmian was alive to respond to a Roman's query if this was well done of her lady by proclaiming that it was \n\n&gt; befitting of one descended from so many noble kings\n\nbefore dropping dead herself. But in this scene Charmian and Iras are already long dead.\n\n2:53:15 I was definitely not expecting *actual* apotheosis here, but that sacred cobra foreshadowing paid off I guess. Still, there is no evidence that the Isaic cult was right or that Egyptian mysticism actually provided a path to everlasting life.\n\nAlso way to go glossing over the fates of Cleopatra's children. I mean, this ending implies that Caesarion survived in India and pretends her children by Antony did not exist.\n\nWell, I guess this is the end. That miniseries was only three hours. To be honest, I kind of enjoyed watching it, it was OK in some places although it was cringe worthy history. The costumes were anachronistic, the plot rushed and it cut corners when it came to her lifetime but it summed up the important events and some scenes were highly entertaining.\n\nAll in all, it was highly inaccurate and basically copy pasted from *Ye Moderne Handbooke of Cleopatra Mythologie*, but I still have to place it as the second best screen adaptation by default which is...eh.\n\nHopefully you all enjoyed reading/watching this as much as I enjoyed making it!",
