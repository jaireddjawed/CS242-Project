        "text": "For this list, I shall be listing my favourite Lovecraft stories I have read so far, so not every story is gonna be in here yet. It's also a list of my personal recommendations for people who want to get into Lovecraft, I made sure to also choose his lesser-known and unique stories so first-time readers don't just see one side of his writing career.\n\n***1. The Call of Cthulhu***  \nSUMMARY: After the death of his late uncle, Francis Wayland Thurston examines the files and documents left behind by his uncle, only to discover about his uncle's findings of a strange world-wide scale share of the same dream, and a secret cult worshipping and trying to awake some ancient entity known as Cthulhu.\n\nREVIEW: This is the most important and essential Lovecraft story, not only for being his most famous one, but also the perfect story to introduce people to Lovecraft as it contains everything that makes Lovecraft...well...Lovecraft. From his use of the fear of the unknown, the concept of ancient unknowable entities from beyond our world known as the \"Great Old Ones\", his racism and xenophobia that appears in a number of his stories, and his strange word use to describe both the indescribable and mundane things that invoke a strange feeling of fear. Starting to read Lovecraft? Start here.\n\n***2. Dagon***  \nSUMMARY: After his ship got hijacked by a German sea raider in WW1, the narrator manages to escape the ship on a life boat and become lost at sea, only to wake up on a strange land mass made of black goo and covered with washed-up sea life.\n\nREVIEW: This story, along with \"Call of Cthulhu\", is a great introduction for first-time readers. This story is essentially the shorter and more simple version of \"Call of Cthulhu\", being only around five pages long. Like many Lovecraft stories, despite this being set in the real world, it has a very surreal and dream-like quality to it, sometimes making you question what's real and what isn't. It also really sets up the fear of the unknown quite well, as well as future monsters appearing in other Lovecraft stories.\n\n***3. The Colour Out of Space***  \nSUMMARY: A surveyor from Boston travels to the west of Arkham and discovers a strange location known only as the \"blasted heath\". As he talks to an old man who witnessed what happened, it's revealed that a farmer family known as the Gardners had a strange meteorite crash into their farmland, which contained a strange substance that could only be described as a \"colour\", but it wasn't any colour that anyone had ever seen. Since the meteorites landing, strange things began happening around the farmland, especially in the well, as if whatever came from the meteorite began changing and sucking the life from everything in its vicinity.\n\nREVIEW: This was Lovecraft's favourite story, and it's not hard to see why. This is easily one of his scariest stories, and contains one of the most \"unknown\" of his unknowable entities. It's a simple, straightforward horror story that really presents strange ideas of what could be lurking out there in space and the universe, like maybe a sentient unknown colour.\n\n***4. The Dunwich Horror***  \nSUMMARY: In the hillbilly town of Dunwich, a family known as the Whateleys had had a knew strange, monstrous, goat-like baby boy named Wilbur, whose father is completely unknown, and he somehow kept growing at an impossible rate. Wilbur's grandfather and mother, who are into strange practices and rituals, have special plans for Wilbur, and the townspeople keep seeing the family doing strange things. It's soon found out that Wilbur's plans that involve his unknown father could bring the destruction of all life on Earth if he isn't stopped, and that the family has been hiding something much more horrifying than even Wilbur himself in their attic.\n\nSUMMARY: This is easily one of Lovecraft's most famous stories, as well as one of his longer ones. This is one of the few stories that feature evil human villains, and (POTENTIAL SPOILER) have them win in the end. The Whateley family are easily very disgusting and horrifying, especially Wilbur, who is implied to not be fully human. It also introduces us to an important Lovecraft entity and more lore about the Great Old Ones. This is quite a fun and interesting horror story, and definitely. The one thing people might not enjoy is Lovecraft's obvious dislike for hillbillies and the way he writes their accent is really hard to understand that actual hillbillies might have a hard time reading it.\n\n***5. The Shadow Over Innsmouth***  \nSUMMARY: A man named Robert Olmstead comes across a strange old fishing town named Innsmouth, but all the citizens there look very odd, almost fish-like, and behave strangely. Robert then tries to find out more about what's going on with the town, it's history, and we soon find out what made his report to the military cause them to torpedo a nearby reef, but also take the townspeople hostage into concentration camps.\n\nREVIEW: Also one of Lovecraft's most popular story, as well as one of his longer ones. This story has some interesting horror and provides a lot more lore and story connecting back to \"Dagon\". The story also has an amazing reveal at the end, so worth reading.\n\n***6. The Rats in the Walls***  \nSUMMARY: A man named Delapore moves into his ancestral home in England called Exham Priory, a mansion resting near the cliff edge. But ever since he lived in the mansion, he keeps hearing scratching noises from within the walls, almost like there were rats in there. The more he digs deep into finding out what's going on, the more he discovers horrifying secrets of his home and his family, and there's something hidden underneath his mansion.\n\nREVIEW: This is easily one of the scariest and disturbing Lovecraft stories, it has a very disturbing atmosphere, and really gives you a sense of dread the more you learn about the secret history of the narrator's family. It also has one of the most disturbing endings of any Lovecraft story.\n\n***7. Nyarlathotep***  \nSUMMARY: Humanity begins experiencing a strange sense of dread and plagued with nightmares of some oncoming evil, that it becomes such a vast social problem. Suddenly, a strange man resembling a pharaoh named \"Nyarlathotep\" appeared out of Egypt, who brings with him a strange and horrifying presence. He travels from city to city, showing his incredible and impossible scientific devices as well as horrifying prophecies, and slowly gaining popularity, and wherever he goes, the city is plagued by the screams resulting from horrific nightmares.\n\nREVIEW: Easily one of my favourites. This is one of Lovecraft's shorter stories, being only several pages long, but it really is effective. The whole story feels so surreal and dream-like, it's reporting a real event (in the story), but it feels so strange and nightmarish. This is also an introduction to one of Lovecraft's most important entities.\n\n***8. The Music of Erich Zann***  \nSUMMARY: A university student decided to stay in a cheap apartment in a very shady, unknown street called \"Rue d'Auseil\". During his stay there, he hears music coming from the apartment's attic, later finding out that it came from an old German musician named Erich Zann, who behaved sometimes friendly, but also very strange. He soon finds out that there is more going on to the old man's nightly music routine in the attic than previously thought.\n\nREVIEW: This is one of Lovecraft's most interesting stories. The street the story is set in feels very dreary and nightmare-like, and the reveal in the end as well as the mystery surrounding the street is one of Lovecraft's best moments.\n\n***9. The Quest of Iranon***  \nSUMMARY: A golden-haired prince named Iranon travels from city to city singing and telling tales about Aira, the great kingdom he came from where he was a prince. He journeys throughout the land in hope of returning to his home kingdom.\n\nREVIEW: This is personally one of my favourite Lovecraft stories ever, and this story proves Lovecraft isn't just a Cthulhu horror writer. This story is part of his \"Dream Cycle\" series, a collection of stories based on dreams and set in the Dreamlands, a fantasy land reality that can only be entered through dreams. This story has a very sweet and curious feel to it, as we watch Iranon's adventures through different cities and meeting different people. But what makes this story so great for me is the ending, this story not only has a shocking reveal, but also has one of, if not *the* saddest Lovecraft ending ever. Trust me, the story's worth reading just for the ending. This is not the kind of story you might expect to write compared to his more popular stories, but this one is really worth reading.\n\n***10. The Other Gods***  \nSUMMARY: The high priest of Ulthar named Barzai the Wise, who has tremendous knowledge of Earth's gods, seeks to climb the mountain Hatheg-Kla, said to be the last residing spot for the gods of Earth after humans kept taking the other mountains. Barzai jouneys to the peak of the mountain along with his disciple Atal, and begin noticing strange things happening at the peak, only for Barzai to find out that the gods of Earth have relations to powers not meant to be seen by human eyes.\n\nREVIEW: Another one of Lovecraft's Dream Cycle stories, meaning it's a fantasy setting. This stories pretty simple and basic compared to Lovecraft's other stories, but it's still a fun and memorable read.\n\n***11. Memory***  \nREVIEW: I can't make a synopsis for this story since it's only a page long, but trust me when I say this is one of Lovecraft's best and really signifies his belief of humanity's insignificance in the grand scheme of things. The story's short and quick, but very surreal and dreamy with how it describes the setting with just a few words. Definitely read this one, it's short and quick to finish but it's worth it.\n\n***12. The Strange High House in the Mist***  \nSUMMARY: In the seaside town of Kingsport, there lies a strange house that resides right a the edge of a very tall cliff that overlooks the town, so high up that the ocean mist that engulf the entire town doesn't touch it. A philosopher named Thomas Olney visits the town of Kingsport and decides to try and see what is going on with that house. As he reaches the house, he realises it's filled with strange fantastic things he could never imagine.\n\nREVIEW: This is another non-horror story by Lovecraft, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. The mystery surrounding the house really intrigues you in the first half, not knowing what to expect. But once you get to the house, the story becomes very fantastical and wondrous. This is a very surreal, but also a very feel-good story by Lovecraft, which you don't see often from him. The story also has some nice references to his other stories. Definitely check this story out.\n\nHonorable Mentions:  \n\\- The Lurking Fear  \n\\- The Cats of Ulthar  \n\\- The Outsider  \n\\- Pickman's Model  \n\\- The Temple  \n\\- Ex-Oblivione (too short to give a synopsis without spoiling, but one of his best stories, in my opinion.)  \n\\- The Shunned House  \n\\- The White Ship",

I'm back in that part of the cycle. I've been reading again for the last 3-4 days and I find myself wanting to read constantly and I feel more happy. \n\nRight now I'm reading *The English Girl* by Daniel Silva. I've been reading through the Gabriel Allon series by Daniel Silva for probably the last year and a half or so. I really enjoy the series and there's still quite a few books left in the series. Which is nice, so I don't have to worry about finding books to read. \n\nAnyone else go in those cycles?",

        "text": "I used to be a much more avid reader when I was younger compared to now. I think this progression is something a lot of people can relate to, and while I don't really know why it happens I'm very interested in turning that trend around for myself. \n\nI've come to realize it's not exactly that my attention span is smaller than before, because other interesting media or audio books or whatnot are able to hold my attention quite well. And it's not exactly that I'm not reading a lot, I just only read things in short bursts. \n\nHere's what I've noticed. I think my reading skills have been adapted to be better at scanning for and ingesting vocabulary and word order and then immediately coming to a conclusion about that block of text. When I'm reading a passage in a book if I'm not *literally concentrating* on reading each word sequentially, my eyes jump ahead and around and start reading 2 sentences at once. Once I started notice this it was actually quite bizarre; trying to focus feels almost like trying to meditate, let your mind go quiet but your thoughts are racing and constantly trying to internalize the message within the text before you can actually read it. \n\nI think part of this problem will be fixed with practice, and part of it might just be that my mind's baseline state is kind of racing anyway if I think about it (maybe you can relate). \n\nWhat I find really interesting is that if I read aloud, this problem goes away entirely. My brain speed is limited by my mouth speed, and I only comprehend a few words ahead of what I'm saying, so I can actually read passages faster and more efficiently. I've found I'm a very audio-driven person when it comes to learning and comprehension, I prefer a lecture or a conversation to a text book and I prefer voice memo's to written journaling in many cases. I guess I just think through my mouth. \n\nAs a bit of a compromise, I'm finding myself silently reading things \"aloud\" when I'm in public or when I just want to practice reading books or papers or articles without orating them. My only qualm about this is that I have this unfounded idea in my head that having to mouth the words you read is somehow inferior?? I don't know where I got this idea but I feel like the more \"proper\" and \"intellectual\" thing to do is read quietly and quickly to yourself without moving your lips. I know it probably doesn't matter but I wonder if any of you can relate, or assure me that my seemingly latent ability to read quietly and effectively to myself will come back with a few months of practice.",

It is set in a viking age and is a fictional story with real characters implemented into the story. I may not be the best writer but it is something I enjoy.

        "text": "Over a year ago, I picked up Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro. I was excited because I’d heard nothing but good things about Ishiguro and his “genius” works. So I read Never Let Me Go…and, although it’s a very short read, it was a slog to get through. I remember hating the narrative and being so overwhelming annoyed at the characters and dialogue. I was very disappointed that I hated the book because I had such high hopes. \n\nThen I just so happened to pick up The Unconsoled from a thrift store. It was 2 dollars so I figured why not…I couldn’t get past 100 pages. The book was boring and slow and seemed incredibly pointless. I dropped it and resigned myself to just not liking Kazuo Ishiguro. That should’ve been the end of my journey with him. \n\nBut I’m too stubborn to let a good author slip me by. So I waited awhile and then bought The Remains of The Day because of how highly it’s lauded. My expectations were low as they could be and I was prepared for a slog. I’d never been more happy to be proven wrong. The Remains of the Day was beautiful. I cried. I reflected on my own past relationships and goals. The book moved me and proved to be a masterpiece. I was so blown away it’s almost indescribable. “Yes,” I thought. “This is a man who won the Nobel prize in literature.”\n\nNeedless to explain, I went back almost immediately and reread Never Let Me Go. And I *got it*. I got it. The nuances from the start of the book; the misdirection of the narrative; the subdued prose and purposefully annoying characters due to their ignorance. It was marvelous the way I viewed the book as though for the first time. As though it had changed entirely, when really it was me who had changed. The book moved from a 2/5 rating to a 5/5, with The Remains of the Day getting a 6/5. \n\nNow I’m wondering what other books would be better with a reread. If I picked up The Unconsoled right now and gave it a proper chance, would it change like the other book? I’m not sure, but I will find out at some point. After I read the rest of Ishiguro’s bibliography. \n\nSo, to end a long and drawn out post, I recommend not only reading Ishiguro, but maybe revisiting books you hated or were disappointed by in the past. Sometimes, when we’re looking for something in a story, we can’t find it until we’ve quit our search and given up. I think we often misdirect ourselves with our expectations and it ruins perfectly good books.",

        "text": "I’m studying classics at university and during a modern literature module we studied Jane Eyre. Now I have read it all, written many notes and essays on it and have a pretty good grip on it (not particularly hard when the author is the least subtle author I have ever read). \n\nThe first volume was excellent and while I did find the elevated language which sounded Brontë had been consulting a thesaurus regularly (I doubt she did but still), I enjoyed the sense of realism mixed with a sense of foreboding gothic. I enjoyed watching Jane grow and was excited to read volume 2. \n\nVolume 2 is decent although Mr. Rochester was a tad melodramatic, I guess that’s the point. Things defo slowed down here and I started to find the novel’s wordiness annoying. Brontë is not at all subtle in any way. Like she explains literally everything and the suspenseful hints she brings about like the shattered tree were just contrived. Anyway I soldiered on through and finally got to volume 3. \n\nVolume 3 is really strange. Jane runs away due to her strong moral convictions about doing the right thing in accordance with God. The whole volume takes on a very deep religious tone and pretty much every page is littered with lengthy sentences relating to the lamb or god’s glory or whatever. I mean I get that they were there from the beginning but not like this. Maybe a reference here or there and obviously you had Helen. But volume 3 takes it to new levels. I know that Brontë’s father was a preacher and honestly it feels like she had some kind of epiphany or something idk because it’s really strange how much of a shift it is. Everything with St. John is incredibly tedious and the whole volume could have been reduced to 30 pages imo. Also Jane (or Brontë) justifying St. John’s controlling, frankly quite abusive, character as simply a ‘heroic’ christian who’s task Jane was to weak to perform was very off putting. I’m not sure what the take away in Jane’s development was supposed to be here. \n\n\nAnyway did anyone actually like volume 3? Am I missing something?",

        "text": "Last year I read 49 books. This years I've spend two months toiling on The Count of Monte Cristo. I just can't get into it. I understand from the time period that concepts like \"editing\" didn't exist, but this has been rough. The most challenging part for me is that I'm a person who can happily DNF. But The Count of Monte Cristo feels so schizophrenic that I bounce back and forth between being interested and bored out of my mind at too rapid a rate to quit. I've found that the Cliff Notes version of the story (which I sometimes read in parallel) capture pretty much all the relevant bits of the story and do a great job of filtering out the noise. Are there other examples of books which folks have read where they prefer the editorialized version?\n\nP.S. I still have seven hours left of this horrendous novel.",

The characters inner monologues and feelings are beautifully written. Ayn Rand has a way of bringing into words things that you always knew, you just didn't know you knew it. This is the mark of high intellect. She's able to articulate so eloquently all the messy contradictions of our thoughts and feelings, that we often can't even explain ourselves. It was an utter joy to read the dialogues and thoughts in this book.\n\nThe roller coaster of emotions and intellectual conundrums characters go through throughout the book is so well written, and you're able to see bits of yourself in everyone from the industrial genius Hank Rearden to the loathsome coward James Taggart.\n\nThe book is unapologetic in its approach to it's philosophy. Characters are archetypes: they are ideals and philosophies given human form. Despite this, other than perhaps John Galt who is the pinnacle of the ideal (a superhuman), the characters still remain utterly human and relatable throughout their trials and tribulations.\n\nMany of the speeches were just incredible and I've had to go back and reread them several times. Francico's speech on money: phenomenal. The bum's speech on the evils of the \"from each according to his ability to his according to his need\"... I was always ambivalent on this outlook but reading this book I genuinely found it horrifying and I think she's completely right.\n\nCould the book have been shorter? Perhaps. Is it Ayn Rand unapologeticly presenting why her worldview is \"correct\". It certainly is. But again, the actual writing is so good that I think she's earned the right to create the book in this way. Not just that, she's clearly very intelligent and has a lot of keen insight into things. Again, Francisco's speech on the nature of money... I challenge anyone to read that and not feel some deep appreciation for what she's articulated.",

        "text": "So, I started reading \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\" and I noticed something that I wanted to talk about. In the early chapters, Emily and her dad travel across the countryside in horse drawn vehicle and the writer takes multiple chapters to describe the journey.\n\nWhile it wasn't uneventful, I don't think that the small incidents that occurred here will have significant impact on the larger plot.\n\nThe reason this section stands out to me is because of how different it is from other fiction (modern fantasy etc.) which often takes place in similar setting. The distinct lack of modern transportation technology makes the journey slow and stretched across multiple weeks (?) By contrast, in many of the modern works, that present a similar aesthetic on the surface tend to employ some kind of \"fast travel\" mechanic or otherwise create a sense of urgency. They don't allow the characters to just take their time.\n\nAnother thing I observed was how these characters interacted with their environment. Unlike modern day tourists, when these people find some beautiful scenery, their first impulse is not to pull out a camera. Instead, they stop at the place and just enjoy the vista with their own eyes. Which seemed so wholesome to me.\n\nAnyway, this is not meant as a criticism of any sort. I just wanted to share some observations and impressions that I had.\n\nGood Day!",

        "text": "I read the novel \"Bloody fool for Love: a Spike prequel\" by Willaim Ritter. It's the most recent novel. I had read all the other Buffy novels over the years and there's like 60 of them. I was hoping that there would be new ones at some point. So when I heard about William Ritter's novel, I was over the moon.\n\nAnd it says in the synopsis:\n\n\"\"*Bloody Fool for Love\"* from *New York Times* best-selling author William Ritter **marks the beginning of an all-new series that explores prequel stories about fan-favorite Buffy characters.**\n\nSo this is the first novel in a series that explores prequel stories about fan-favorite Buffy characters. So who do you think will get a prequel story next? I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a Giles prequel. We've seen some bits of his past in the TV show, but we never got the whole story. Pretty sure there will be a Gile prequel story in this all-new series that explores prequel stories about fan-favorite Buffy characters. We'll probably get the whole story about his past, like how het met his then-friends, how he started practicing black magic with Ethan and the other ones in the group, the whole Eyghon incident, how he became Ripper and who gave him this nickname and why, how he located the slayer and what he was thinking when he moved to Sunnydale/America, plus everything we haven't been told about his Ripper days in the TV show (and everyone knows by now that there's more to this story than the bits we've seen in the TV show in season 2, 3, and 4, it's obvious), and how Giles walked the path of redemption and amended his ways, joined the Watchers' council, didn't always see eye to eye with the council folks and would try to get them to become more open-minded and more progressive as his relationship with Buffy develops (he start thinking for himself instead of letting people like Quentin Travers manipulate him and control him), etc.\n\nI'm pretty sure we will get a Gile prequel story, and I'm looking forward to reading the whole story.\n\nBut who else do you think will get a prequel story? Certainly not Buffy's friends (Willow, Xander, Cordelia, etc). When we see them for the first time in the first episode, they're around the age of 16, and who want to hear the story of their boring childhood from before Buffy moved to Sunnydale? They have no interesting or exciting backstory that predates season 1 because they aren't old enough for that. Dawn was 14 when we first met her and she had fake memories of a childhood that either never happened at all of they it did happened but in a parallel univere instead of the original universe (she might have gotten those memories from an alternate version of herself who had an actual childhood). So there's not much interesting or exciting backstory that predates season 1 here.\n\nSame thing for Joyce, no one wants to hear about her boring, normal past prior to Buffy becoming the slayer, unlike Gile there was not much supernatural in her past prior to her arrival in Sunnyday. Prior to her arrival in Sunnydale, she didn't even know that warlocks/witches, vampires and demons were real. As for Anya, I don't think most people are interested in hearing again about she turned men into trolls, conveniently failed to realize that women cheat too because she's very biased in this way (women cheat too, not just men and she only ever offered her vengeance services to women which makes her biased and sexist, she always absolve women of any personal responsibility when they cheat while being merciless with men when they cheat and she even killed a whole bunch of men in a bathroom for supposedly cheating in season 6 or was it season 7, well not too long after Xander left her at the altar because he was scared he would become an abusive spouse like hid dad and she became a vengeance demon again, and Buffy decided to to end Anya after she killed a roomful of men, if it had been a roomful of cheating women she wouldn't have raised a hand on them because that would have been \"violence against women\" but she was totally cool with killing a bunch of men which is violence against men, Anya was biased and misandrist like this and had a double standard that says that it's okay for women to cheat on men but not the reverse, but even if someone cheated that doesn't give you the right to torture and/or murder them, murder and torture are crimes and a crime is a crime and two wrongs don't make a right, I've seen quite a few cheating women in my days, they can be just as unfaithful as some of the men are, bt there's this hideous double standard in our society where male on female infidelity is viewed as the worst thing ever while female on male infidelity is excused and defended and that's not cool), and how freaked out every time she saw bunnies, that would get old real fast.\n\nFaith is about the same age as Buffy, she had encounters with the supernatural prior to her arrival in Sunnydale, she even had an encounter with the vampire who killed her watcher, she had an abusive mother and an absentee father (she mentionned her mother's abusive behavior and her mother's drinking and going out all night habits in the show a couple times, and she never mentions her father as if he simply wasn't in the picture and hadn't been for quite a while by then).\n\nWe already have a Faith prequel story entitled \"Go ask Malice: A slayer's diary\" by Joseph Levy (we get to read about her teenage years, her abusive mother and her mother's abusive boyfriends and her mother's failed relationships, the abusive foster care families faith had to live with, her first encounters with vampires and demons, her first watcher's, her encounters with Kakistos and how her first watcher died, her friendship with a guy, her encounter with a past slayer, how she moved to Sunnydale, etc):\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go\\_Ask\\_Malice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ask_Malice)\n\n[https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Go\\_Ask\\_Malice](https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Go_Ask_Malice)\n\nBut I wouldn't be opposed to another Faith prequel that would be different from this one in some ways. There can be two or three different versions of a story, or a story taking place in a parallel universe with an alternate version of said character. The possibilities are endless.\n\nBut other than Giles and Faith, I can't think of a character who would have enough of an interesting and/or exciting backstory that predates their first appearance in the show to get a prequel story and a whole book revolving around them and their past. But maybe you have an idea as to which characters could get a prequel story in this all-new books series.\n\nAlso, when are the next volumes/next prequel stories in this new book series going to be released? Did the authors and whoever is working on this book series said they have plans concerning this, did they mention which characters might get a prequel, and did they mentionned any information/update? Do we have like any infos on the future volumes or where this new prequel book series is going? If not, how can we keep ourselves informed on this if there's no information available? I don't read Buffy comics, I much prefer novels. And I can't wait to read new BTV novels, when I read the 60 or so novels in the series I was sad and thought there would never be new ones, I hadn't heard of a new BTVS novel for years when I found out about Ritter's Spike prequel.\n\nAnd when I heard that this new book was the beginning of an all-new series that explores prequel stories about fan-favorite Buffy characters, I was happy to know that I would eventually get new BTVS material to read besides fanfictions (not that I don't like fanfictions, some of them are great, and I wrote fanfics for three years myself not BTVS fanfics though, it's just that no matter how much I love virtual creative works, there are times when I want to read a tangible paper books that I can take everywhere with me, I still love the feel of paper products in a digital world and page-turning sounds).\n\nSo, which characters do you think will get a prequel that takes place before their first appearance on the show (just like Ritter did with Spike)? And how long do you think it's going to take before the next prequel story is released?\n\nTake care,\n\nMichelle.",

The twists and turns and eventual revealing of the plot are impactful and starkly beautiful to me. I wish I could have that again.\n\nBooked to Die by John Dunning would be a close second.\n\nI can read mysteries a second or third time and just enjoy the ride and the characters but I can't get the first read od those two books back again.",

I would never be able to \"read\" as much as I do if not for audiobooks, as I listen to them on commutes, chores, work etc. But to me it's still \"reading\", do you agree? Or no?",
