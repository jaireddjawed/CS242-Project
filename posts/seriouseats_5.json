        "text": "I‚Äôve been cooking recipes from The Wok and had surplus scallions so decided to make the scallion oil. \n\nThe recipe in the book says to cut the scallions into 1 inch segments and reserve the dark greens away from the white and pale green. I made the recipe as directed, then decided to check Kenji‚Äôs YouTube channel to [watch him make the noodles.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lC87cKrwU5I). He makes the scallion oil at the start and cuts them completely differently to what he says to do in the recipe. He cuts them into longer lengths and cuts them lengthwise. \n\nConfused as the book says to cut into segments (like small cylinders) which I assume will give a different taste and texture. Hoping I didn‚Äôt waste my scallions and it all ends up tasting about the same!\n\nAnyone else notice this?",
