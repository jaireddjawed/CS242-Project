        "text": "It's late and somehow I'm too tired to sleep, so why not do a light confessional. \n\nI'm turning thirty later this year. Came into grad school a bit \"late\" after wandering around some other careers through my twenties and finding them unfulfilling. Coming back to academia was a big step for me; I left an abusive relationship and several years of prioritizing the needs of others over myself to throw my hat into the proverbial ring. And it's paid off!\n\nI cannot begin to explain the amount of personal growth and new challenges I've had to confront in the last six months. In a lot of ways, I feel like I'm rediscovering myself - mostly in the things I suck at, to be honest. Not irredeemably so, mind you. Things like realizing where my burnout rate was and what self-care actually means (for me, a ton of it is in giving myself the mental *permission* to set tasks aside more than the *doing* of self care things, if that makes sense). Developing a sense of style, oddly enough - I come from a bit of a professional background and am trying to resist the siren call of jeans and hoodies for everything. I'm teaching myself how to read again, in terms of compressing a great deal of information into an hour or two. I'm developing a love-hate relationship with German grammar. I'm igniting curiosities that old, high-school me would have been astonished by: genuine interests in philosophy, classical authors, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Jane Austen. \n\nBit by bit I can feel myself changing into the kind of person I kind of dimly glimpsed a decade ago when I was trying to imagine my future. Not in the job itself, necessarily - I don't think anyone aspires to a TA's paycheck at 29 - but in the things I spend my time thinking and writing about. I'm... kind of proud of myself. Eager to keep going through the coming tough spots. I'm sure sitting down to tackle my thesis properly in the next few months will uncover a whole new array of personal flaws and obstacles to surpass. \n\nBut you know, for the first time in my life, I'm not exhausted by the idea. In my former years as a member of my nation's military and then as an administrator in the corporate world, I was filled with this horrible lack of ambition, as if I were just struggling along in the current and trying to avoid drowning rather than swimming with intent. Now I have this... *fire* to push through. I don't know if academia's going to play nicely with me and I'll slide smooth as you please into a PhD program once I'm finished my Master's - or what's waiting after that with postdoctoral or faculty work - but I have this feeling that it will work out. It might be the long way around, but that's fine. Lord knows I've done that before. \n\nAnyway, just some thoughts. I'd love to hear yours, both new and experienced grad students - we form a community, after all.",

        "text": "I've heard a lot about people quitting grad school because the work was too challenging, but rarely hear about people doing so because it wasn't challenging enough. I was in a Linguistics program where 75% of the assignments involved making and presenting digital art collages (i.e. \"after reading the book, make a collage about how you felt while reading it\"), writing blog posts, or playing games with my classmates over various apps and websites. Almost all the classes were taught by the same two professors so I knew if I continued, they would all be like this. I didn't really feel like I was learning or accomplishing anything because there was a constant focus on making things \"fun\" and began to question how all of this would lead to my desired career goal. So I quit the program stating that I did not feel it was a good fit for me, applied to another university to a different but related program, and got a long email from my former advisor about how disappointed she was because I had gotten the highest grades in all my classes.\n\nA lot of people have told me that I made a huge mistake and wasted my time / money but for me an enormous weight was lifted as soon as I quit. I regained my passion for research and felt like an adult again rather than wasting hours making collages and videos talking about my feelings in something I assumed would be a relatively scientific and research-driven field. I am hoping that the new program will be a bit more traditional and allow me to focus on some topics of interest. \n\nBut my question is - do you think that more and more graduate programs are shifting toward this new style of learning or did I just have bad luck and stumble into some kind of experimental thing? The program was at a credible state university so it was really surprising. Also, if anyone has ever had a similar experience, feel free to share.",

Undergrad B.S. in Civil Engineering.\n\nI struggled a lot in undergrad because I was forced by parents to become a civil engineer. I was unable to really explore different electives or majors because that was the only path that I was \"allowed\" to take. My grades suffered a lot because I forced myself through this major, and partied/drank a lot.\n\nI've been working full-time as an engineer for while now, and I can finally admit that this is the wrong career for me.  I would like to pursue a career in psychology--would love to become a therapist through a MSW or LMFT program . I especially would like to help children manage their emotions through mindfulness. At my current job, I've been given  the opportunity to take a lot of emotional intelligence/leadership classes, which I put in practice as a mentor for new hires. Outside of work, I volunteer at a non-profit serving low-income school children. \n\nMy civil engineering does not meet ANY of the requirements for a MSW or LMFT program (grad school). I did not take any of the required psychology classes. I also barely survived undergrad and do not meet the GPA requirements . Does my engineering license cancel out GPA? \n\nHow can I pursue this career? Should I go to a community college to take the basic classes, get an AA in psychology  and then apply for graduate school? \n\nSince I graduated 9 years ago, does GPA matter? (an engineering gpa). Should I take the GRE?",

As of time relevancy, journals should be within 5 years, but some leeway is given. I have already started writing and collecting my data and know what methodlogy i am going to use, moroever since i am only doing secondary research, analysing the data shouldnt take long. Im a quick reader and can gain the grasps of papers really quickly, usually takes me 1 hour to read a journal from start to finish and i avarage around 9 hours fo uni work per week (im on monk mode, if you know you know)\n\nI know i have a 1 month to complete my dissertationa and that some of my friends are also in the same boat as i am but im starting to stress since this is the first time i am writing a dissertation so i feel like i might not have enough time to complete my litetrature review.\n\nAlso the literature review needs to be about 2000/2500 words, between 7/8 pages long. I have already figured out the possible themes i am going to write about from my 6 papers from which i derived my topic and understand the need to write the literature review starting from a general prespecting and narrowing down as you go along.\n\nbasically what im trying to ask is, do you guys think i have enough time to complete it ? ideally i'd like to finish my literature review in 2 weeks maybe 3...\n\nBtw you are all lovely people and hope you've had ana amaizing day and thanks for helping out a fellow student in need &lt;3.",

He seems to have okay funding, but is definitely still a promising up and coming professor. \n\nI would like to get into academia after my PhD - and I would like to know your honest opinion. How far does the name of the school where you got your PhD take you when applying for academic positions? Does it differ if you want to go into industry, or does it still provide the same advantages? Most people seem to agree that going to an ivy will open way more doors for me but I also don't know anyone in the academia field, so I wanted to ask here. Thanks in advance!!!",

I got two hard rejections, one that said “we aren’t accepting any students into the program at this time” (despite the fact that I had talked to a professor about potential openings/projects), and waitlisted for another one (my faculty member contact at that school said he would have like to work with me but ultimately they were accepting very few students due to Covid and he did not get allotted a student).\n\nThis past application cycle I applied to another school—just the one, this time, after having successful conversations with two of the faculty members there. I just found out I got rejected.\n\nI currently work as a temp technician (not technically a full time appointment) for a state university. The cherry on top of all this is I was also just passed over for a full-time position at the same research station because the other candidate has a master’s. \n\nI am at a total loss here. Is it worth trying again, or do I just quit completely and find a new career? If I do try again, what can I do to make myself a more viable candidate? For background, I graduated from a small public state university (not a big research school) in 2016 with a 3.3 overall GPA, and a ~3.7 major GPA. I was part of an undergraduate research group there where I conducted my own research, wrote and was awarded a grant for that research from the undergraduate research council, and then published that research in the undergraduate research journal. Since graduating I worked in a more industrial lab doing microbiology testing for about four years before coming back to research this past year. My GRE scores,though only one of the schools has asked for them, were about 60th percentile in writing and quantitative and above 90th percentile in verbal. I had recommendation letters from my former professors in undergrad who I had worked with in the research group. My biggest sore spot I can think of is a subpar grade (C+) in statistics in undergrad.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there anything I can improve? Is it worth moving forward at all or should I just find something else to do with my life? I need serious help.",

I have been working in a neuroimmunology lab and my GPA is a 3.45, which is relatively low but I have other things that help my application (and another more semester to bump my GPA up for my applications). I have a couple of schools in mind because of certain PIs at those schools. I am actively engaged in research and have found their works to be compelling and in line with what I want to research. I wanted to know if it was appropriate to email those PIs about my interest in their lab. As I am not a student in those universities I wasn’t sure if it was a good thing to do. I also would like to know if it generally helps/hurts my applications to email PIs at those universities. I want to build a relationship with them before the application process. Some of the schools seem like a stretch, but because of my interest in the PI’s work, I want to maximize the possibility of getting in. If anyone has experience with this, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know the official application process is pretty far away but I want to get a head start to strengthen my apps. It’s an anxiety inducing feeling lol. It feels like I’m a junior in high school all over again. Thanks!",

Let's say I am writing an article and cite 50 different books or papers in the article. Now, if these different books or papers disagree or contradict each other in terms of certain historical facts or interpretations, is there any need for me to discuss these interpretations unless they pertain in a major way to my argument?\n\nI am thinking here about either contradictions between some of the works I cite on points/facts that might be related to but are not directly mentioned in my paper or about minor interpretations or facts where I follow and cite one source over another that might disagree slightly. I would think that unless these things pertain to my own argument I don't need to elaborate on the contradiction any further.\n\nI am concerned about this primarily because a) such discussions can lead to overly long footnotes and b) I suspect that unless a contradiction or disagreement in the literature is of major importance to my research, I might also overlook that there is a contradiction (e.g. I cite source a) to say an event happened in 1765 without remembering/noticing that one of the other books listed in my bibliography says it happened in 1766).\n\nAt the same time, I am afraid that if I do not discuss a contradiction/disagreement in the scholarship, I might be criticised.\n\nI'd be grateful for any advice and help!",

While I am proud of myself to an extent for earning a bachelor's degree, I am a bit saddened because, to be completely honest, I despise this field. Ever since I was a young child, my biggest passion was literature, and other forms of storytelling. I always loved reading books and watching movies, and one day I wanted to tell stories that would blow people away, as an author. I am a naturally gifted writer; it has always been my biggest strength since kindergarten. However, as I got older and college started to come around, nearly everyone in my life, from family, friends, and teachers, completely disgraced my dream. I was told that my dream wasn't realistic, wasn't going to make me any money, and that I should pursue something more realistic instead, like business. As a young teenager, these words devastated me, and I enrolled in college in a field I have zero interest in because I had to listen to others. I recently rediscovered how talented I truly am as a writer, and I really don't want to put my talents to waste. I was thinking of pursuing grad school in the writing field, would this be a wise decision? Or are there careers in business that could utilize a talented writer? I'm already in my last semester so I'm obviously going to go through with graduation in May, but I really want to prepare for my future career in doing something that brings me joy, as opposed to something that bores me to tears. Any insight is appreciated :)",

I have always gotten straight As, but I bombed my first test)\n\nI understand why- I mean this was a very different test. It was super tricky and worded in a complicated way.

I need to know how to approach these questions correctly and put on my critical thinking hat. I usually think outside the box, I am an over thinker, yet these questions require you to think in a different certain way, that I am not used to. I feel dumb.

Does anyone have any resources, youtube videos or channels, or anything else that helped them adapt to this way of thinking that they are looking for (and that I know is one the licensing exam). **Anything that helped them learn how to approach these questions and pick the correct answer?** I just want to do better but don't know how to start.\n\nI understand you can pick the correct answer by process of elimination, picking up on key words, and/or using logic. That's why I feel dumb. This is hard.\n\nI am completely new to this. I also think I am overthinking it and just don't believe in myself. I also didn't study and learn all the material to the best of my ability. I half-assed it the way you can in college and still get an A",

        "text": "This will be a long post, so thank you in advance for reading. I am looking for advice on how to navigate the politics of potentially switching advisors and committee members &amp;/or whether I need to leave my program altogether.\n\nI am in my fifth year in a Ph.D. program. Normally, grads in our department are expected to get their MA during year two, then spend years two-four preparing written materials for an oral qualifying exam to become an official Ph.D. candidate. Years four-six are understood as dissertation research years during which you teach your own classes and publish in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nI am very behind this normative timeline; I just got my MA approved. There are some personal reasons why I have fallen behind: strikes, being fired/rehired during said strike, wildfires, floods, COVID, another strike, the death of a family member, and disability and mental health issues.\n\nHowever, another reason for my lack of normal progress is due to my advisor\\[s\\] lack of guidance, structure, or support. It would often take me months to hear back from them with feedback on my paper. I emailed my MA draft three months before the deadline, after receiving no response as to what they're looking for in this draft, and did not hear back until three days before the MA deadline when they said I needed to start over. \n\nAnother example is that I have been registered for independent studies with my two advisors for the past two quarters and they have canceled every. single. meeting. I never met with them once last quarter and we are halfway through the Winter quarter and I have not met with them at all.\n\nIt often takes weeks to hear back from them, they ignore direct questions and requests for feedback and instead offer me vague criteria like 'keep it simple!'\n\nThere are extenuating circumstances as to why I am anxious about rocking the boat to change advisors or ask other faculty for advice that has to do with a faculty bully who targeted me and tried to get my fellowship stripped; we had to bring the union to bear to clear my name but the consequences of this situation on my reputation cannot really be known as the faculty member is highly influential.\n\nI've considered leaving the program as I am so deeply unhappy, but I have put five years of my life into this endeavor and do not want the sunk cost to haunt me. I also am really passionate about my research, but I do not know at what point it makes sense to leave and start over somewhere else or to continue to push through.\n\nHas anyone else made it through their program with ghosts for advisors? Or switched advisors? How did you deal with it? How did you provide your own structure and manage to get work done without feedback or guidance?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Hello there,\n\nI'm a second year PhD student in Analytical Chemistry. I have had a horrendous experience in my program so far. I came to this program specifically for an analytical chemist I did an REU with as an undergrad. As a grad student, he was completely different in his behavior. He stopped coming into work, it became increasingly difficult to get a hold of him, and he was not offering any mentoring. Because he was never around, the group dynamics were really unprofessional. I was fighting to have chemicals taken out of my office because I didn't want my office to be used to store chemicals. I was having arguments about not shooting off lasers behind me and asking them to move their lasers out of my office. The male graduate students were aggressive, and I used to be able to listen to them make really disparaging remarks about the one other female grad student in the group. What sent me over the edge was that I found out that this PI told someone to kill themselves at a conference. Quite frankly, I don't work for unprofessional people and that comment cost the other female grad student someone she was trying to network with as he made it in front of her. I decided to transfer to a new lab, and things went well for about 1 month. I didn't know this about this professor, but after talking with other faculty, it turns out he has anger management problems that almost cost him tenure. Well, I certainly got to see his anger because during a group meeting, this was the second time I had ever presented data to the entire group. Every paper he gave me showed axes with no units on them, he wouldn't tell me what this experimental data was (even though I had not generated it myself, it was his data), and I was having to teach his collaborator very basic Linux line command tools even though I had only been using Linux for about 2 weeks at that point. \n\nDuring this meeting, this PI went absolutely ballistic on me. He started screaming at me in front of the entire group, told me I'm a waste of time and I should be ashamed for being so unprofessional. He forced me to represent it, so I put reasonable units on the graph, and he absolutely lost it and verbally harassed me in front of the entire group. This was bad enough, but then he decided to personally throw all of my stuff out of my desk. My pain medication went missing for an entire weekend because of him (and this is medication that is controlled substance). I only found my possessions when I told the chair that if I don't find my medication, I will have to file a police report and suddenly my belongings materialized. \n\nNeedless to say, there is no departmental support. We have lost 3 different Analytical faculty and I don't even care about mastering out of there. I don't even care if I have to start completely over anymore. I am so sick of being taken advantage of and the department doing nothing over major safety concerns. Plus, we've lost the people I would've transferred to, so it doesn't seem worth it to be in a place that has this many problems. There is a similarly ranked institution that would be closer to my doctors (I have a chronic illness and currently there is no health care options near my current university). I would be getting a significant pay increase, and the department pays all student fees and parking is free. They also have real cost of living increases every year, and I wouldn't have to teach. I wouldn't have an issue being admitted to this program- my grades are fine, and I have shown I can do research because I have projects I've worked on. I'm finding myself at a crossroad, but I don't feel tied to my current place because I haven't taken candidacy exams yet. What would you do reddit?",

During COVID, I found a field that I absolutely love and decided I wanted to pursue a masters' degree (had no intention of trying to move up in rank in that field at first, I was just looking for a job). Until now, I did awesome in grad school, and I kept my 4.0 GPA. I'm in one class that isn't even part of the course sequence I need to take for licensure, but is required to graduate. The professor is a dick and doesn't leave any feedback on papers whatsoever. He just says \"read the APA manual.\" Normally I don't let bad professors drag me down because hey, that's life, some people suck (I did have one or two bad professors in undergrad, but fortunately I understood the material so it wasn't anything more than just unpleasant), but this class is the hardest thing I've ever taken. I can't ask the professor for help because he just says \"read the rubric\" (even the PhD student who actually teaches the material says he doesn't do anything to help students). I completely bombed the first paper and got zero feedback other than copy-paste comments he sent in an email to everyone in the course weeks before. I have panic attacks every night and have resorted to self-harm. I've done everything I can do for my mental health over the past eight months to avoid being hospitalized again, but now I'm back to where I was. I need to take a lot of medication to sleep at night and I've stopped going to therapy because I've been working on passing these courses on top of my full time job. I still love my job and the field I'm in, but this one course is breaking me down. I should specify that at this point, I don't care about getting an A in this damn class, I just want to pass it so I don't have to take it again. The course I'm taking right now that actually pertain to licensure I'm doing great in. I just feel so broken and every morning I wake up I feel panicked because shit is due on Sundays and no matter how early I start, I feel like I'm in a hurry. I'm a complete mess.",

I would love to work as a professor sometime after my PhD, but I have been informed that it is extremely difficult to secure any faculty positions at a university.\n\nConsidering this, I was wondering what other jobs might be work in the interim for a sociology graduate. I am especially interested in research, but I have also been warned that qualitative work is few and far in between, and I would unfortunately be somewhat unqualified for quantitative work.",

Unfortunately it's too late to edit my abstract at this point, but in my original abstract I highlighted some findings that I'm thinking of not including on the poster. Would this be an issue? Obviously they're not going to reject my presentation, but is this frowned upon and/or would it impact competing for poster awards?\n\nFor one set of findings it's because including it on the poster would make it too cluttered in my opinion. The other set of findings being left out are because new data does not support the conclusions we drew in the abstract (nothing I can do about this now other than present the new data which goes against the abstract's conclusions anyways).",

This is my first graduate-related event and am unsure what to expect. I’ve read a few articles and posts about recruitment visits at other universities but haven’t found much information on UConn’s process. I was wondering if anyone has attended an event here and could speak to their experience? Honestly, any and all advice is greatly appreciated as I am extremely nervous about this trip.",

        "text": "Basically I have a colleague who I don't quite vibe with. I'm several years above him, but I have found he relies quite a bit on extra work from me to decrease his workload. I am a woman in case this is relevant.\n\nThe latest is that he is TAing for a math course that I have TAed several times for. He's out of his depth, and so wants me to provide my solutions to all previous assignments so that he can just TA the course based on my work. \n\nI initially agreed, because I like being helpful and I thought it would improve our working relationship. But it turns out that I don't want to spend hours digging for old documents just so that someone who doesn't like me and isn't grateful for the things I do can have an easier time than I did. His sole motivation in life is to never \"go over his hours\", which I'm sympathetic to, but it's grad school. I've just sort of hit a limit of me providing unpaid work for others. The deciding factor for me here is that this person is someone who has talked shit about me and doesn't seem to respect me.\n\nMy issue is that he is sending me several emails a week asking me to send him my work. I've replied everytime that I'm too busy (true), but he keeps writing. What should I do? Again he's several years below me and ghosting probably wouldn't have huge consequences.",

        "text": "Hi all, I’m in my 3rd semester for a 2 year program in Marriage and Family therapy. I initially really liked my cohort of 60 people because everyone seemed super welcoming and inclusive of everyone. There were constantly study groups invites being throw me out to the whole cohort for anyone to join, and social hangouts as well. \nHowever, now that we’re well into the program, cliques have formed and I feel my anxiety interacting with these groups intensifying and feeling more and more like an outsider. It’s to the point where small groups of people will be making plans to go out to clubs together or get their nails done or whatever right infront of other classmates. Most people are fresh out of undergrad, versus a handful of us have had careers before this one (I’m 26 so not that much older), so it doesn’t really help feeling a few years ahead in life from these people. All in all, I think I’m just frustrated because I miss the original feeling of inclusion and this entire experience has me feeling like I’m back in high school. It’s also frustrating because we’re literally going to be therapists, so I would think that inclusion and veering away from excluding others would be something people in this program would at least be aware of? Let me know if I’m completely in the wrong or if you’ve experienced something similar.",
