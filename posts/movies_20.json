        "text": "Just watched The Ritual Killer with Morgan Freeman. The trailer was bad but sometimes a crappy horror movie can be fun to watch anyway...\n\nWow. Why would Morgan Freeman attach his name to this pile of shit? One of the worst movies I've ever seen lol. It's something you might expect from a high school film enthusiast trying his hand at directing... I'm at a loss for words \n\nThe protagonist is a Dollar Store Steven Seagal. He was angry the entire movie and sometimes went entire conversations without blinking in an effort to portray a stereotypical serious/tough cop. They gave him some weird baggage about his dead daughter that contributed nothing to the plot, but was supposed to explain why he was so trigger-happy and pissed off all the time. His daughter drowned (while having a seizure?) but he was an alcoholic and feel asleep while she was swimming - marriage fell apart as a result. The same flashbacks are shown a dozen times throughout the movie. I'm not sure why that backstory would turn him a loose cannon who takes all of his cases personally, but that was their goal. \n\nSeveral of the cast members had distracting accents. This may sound like a weird complaint, but it threw me off. The film is based in Mississippi and the Captain at the police department (who was entirely useless and added nothing to the plot) was going for a Southern US accent but clearly sounded Scandinavian. \n\nThe entire cast seemingly had 0 acting experience aside from Morgan Freeman. SYFY channel level bad. It'd be an insult to compare them to Lifetime Movie Network or Hallmark. I understand that everybody's gotta start somewhere, but given that Morgan Freeman is in this movie, I was expecting a *decent* cast. \n\nI could keep going but there's no point. I don't even know why I wrote any of this. I don't know what to feel right now. I need to go take a cold shower.",

        "text": "Just watched the movie “Aftersun.” As has been discussed, it’s equal parts beautiful and brutal. I’ve been thinking about one of my favorite scenes, and have developed a personal theory regarding its meaning. Would love to hear other thoughts on it as well. \n\nThe specific scene to which I’m referring is the one where they’re in the hotel room, the video recorder is plugged into the TV, and Sophie is asking Calum what he did for his 11th birthday. This scene stuck into my head because of how it was shot. In essence, you see the scene play out in three different ways: in the mirror, on the TV via the recording, and in the reflection of the TV. \n\nI started thinking about the overall theme of the movie (i.e., retroactively trying to make sense of a traumatic event) and how this scene might be sort of a microcosm for that idea. Just as we see three ways the scene is unfolding, there are three “realities” which exist that Adult Sophie has to grapple with. There’s what actually happened (which is impossible for her to piece together), there’s what happened as captured on video (which is a good but imperfect way to piece things together), and there’s what happened as captured by her memory (her mind video recorder, or whatever Young Sophie calls it once her dad shuts off the actual recorder).\n\nProbably making something out of nothing here, but thought it would be interesting to see if anyone agrees/disagrees with it.",

        "text": "Animated films used to make such inspired choices for their characters they’re perfectly fit and embodies them. Pixar and DreamWorks especially… every character used to be perfectly cast. Toy Story, Monsters, inc. Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, HTTYD, Cars… \n\nNowadays it just feels like they hire any big A name celebrity they can think of that’s in Marvel movies right now (Chris Pratt, Tom Holland, Chris Evans all did recent Pixar movies and Tom Holland was an okay match the others didn’t fit the character very well IMO). Or they cast some cliche actor who’s done a ton of animated voice work for big characters already, like Seth Rogen or Jack Black.\n\nThe Mario movie for instance looks great but the voice casting seems so lazy to me. Obviously there’s Pratt as Mario which has been talked about plenty, but even Bowser… I love Jack Black but make Bowser more menacing, it’s okay for animated films to have actually menacing villains and not just try to make everyone funny… bowser should feel more threatening and have a deeper scarier voice… not Jack Black just trying to make his voice deep.\n\nAnd Donkey Kong… Seth rogen just doesn’t fit him at all.\n\nJack Black was Kung Fu Panda and Rogen was mantis in that movie. Rogen was also B.o.B. In Monsters V Aliens and Pumba in The Lion King remake and all characters just sound the same and idk.\n\nEven Puss in Boots 2, which was great, had John Mulaney as Jack Horner, and he was just Spider-Ham in Into the Spiderverse.\n\nI know there’s people whose entire profession is voice acting and they do multiple cartoon characters. I just feel like with movies it’s a bigger deal and you should try to put a bit more thought into it other than “oh this guy did the voice of that character in that other poplar animated movie, let’s have him do this”\n\nI mean why is Chris Pratt playing so many animated characters? His voice is alright \n\nIt just feels to me like animated movies used really take pride in their casting and really assign the role to the exact right person to the point where I’m literally like… yeah that is that characters voice… I can’t see it any other way… this was meant to be…\n\nInstead when I see Donkey Kong and hear Seth Rogen’s voice… it just makes me think of Seth Rogen in a recording studio. It feels forced. I’m like, that is not Donkey Kong’s voice…\n\nAnyways, just a quick rant on wanting more inspired choices for animated character casting, wanted to see if anyone felt similar.",

        "text": "**Tar**, starring Cate Blanchett. It’s about Lydia Tar, “a renowned celebrity conductor who is embroiled in a career-ending scandal over accusations of serial sexual harassment and abuse.”\n\nIt is a mixture of curiosity, musical artistry, and in my opinion, abject failure.\n\nIt starts out with an interview of Lydia Tar being conducted by a journalist, a real one from The New Yorker. It’s long. And for a time, you start to think… is this a movie, or some kind of documentary? After about 8 to 10 minutes, finally… the interview is over and the movie kicks in. For 3 hours.\n\nLydia is this amazingly talented conductor, but she’s also an arrogant b\\*tch. She’s living a life of privilege in Europe, after a rather miserable early childhood in America. In fact, she distanced herself from that past by changing her name (her real name is Linda Tarr). But she’s easily bitter, aloof, and seems to end up making a lot of people around her frustrated and miserable.\n\nThe pace of the movie is lopsided. It’s extremely slow at times, dwelling on mundane things or taking way too long to get personality aspects across. Other times, it picks up the pace, but then abruptly cuts scenes leaving you guessing as to what happened. And in some cases, they’re never revisited… we never know what truly happened.\n\nThe movie is all about the downward spiral of egotistical Lydia Tar. There’s no love lost. You never really grow to like her. In fact, there’s really no one in this movie to identify with and appreciate, because they’re all so transient.\n\nAlso, the musical aspect is complex. There’s many references to aspects of classical music compositions and conducting that use high level references most people won’t get at all. I studied classical music piano for 11 years and I was lost.\n\nI am totally mystified why this movie got such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes and garnered Academy Awards nominations, beyond Blanchett. Cate is in her best form, in terms of role emersion and tremendous characterization. She worked brilliantly hard on this. You can tell. She learned piano pieces and how to conduct an orchestra. She has a good chance of winning Best Actor, but I really hope she doesn’t… the movie just wasn’t worth it all. Very sad.",

Many movies now are just extremely cringeworthy with poor plot lines, in contrast to what used to be the norm.\n\nI feel like it’s similar for romance, rom coms, horror movies, etc all genres from 15+ years ago and now. Anyone else agree?",

I recently saw The Night Before starting Keanu Reeves. Basically Keanu Reeves goes to prom with Aunt Becky and losses her. He spends the whole night trying to find her. Would I say it’s a good movie? Not really. I don’t know what it is but I like the idea of getting to know the characters without having it drawn out for days. I’m looking for movies like 21 Bridges, The Night Before, Snake Eyes, Night of the Living Dead etc.",

Not as big as Hollywood but quite big enough to be profitable. \n\nDoes European audience isn't interested in big blockbusters or they in general don't watch movies much\n\nThere are lot of amazing actors and directors in Europe so making big films won't be any difficult",
