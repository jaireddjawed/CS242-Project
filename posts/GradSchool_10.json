        "text": "I just received an offer letter for a PhD and am going to accept it! It’s within the probably top 10 departments in the US (guesstimating here, but it’s a school everyone in the US knows). But I keep having full on panic attacks when I think about my PhD - particularly about TA-ing. I was an unremarkable undergraduate student with an average humanities GPA in drastically less prestigious department. I spent the last two years as an RA with a fairly well known PI, which I know is why I got admitted. \n\nIt sounds like most PhD students in my future department TA for their funding, but I can’t imagine teaching a class full of undergrad students at this institution. I can’t stress how out of my league this school was when I was applying to my undergrad, and in all the prospective student visits I went to this cycle, almost everyone had a more prestigious undergrad (or even a master degree). I feel like I’d be a letdown as a TA - and I even switched majors between my undergrad and PhD as well, so I have no more intro level set of coursework in the field. I really looked up to my TAs as an undergrad, and I can’t imagine myself as one at all, especially not at this school. \n\nI don’t want to talk down on myself too much - I know I’m a good researcher and during my RAship, I was very productive. But people keep telling me I interview really well, and even though that’s a compliment, it makes me feel like I’ve tricked my future PI into accepting me through my personality alone. \n\nObviously this all sounds very intense and even reading this post back I can tell my anxiety is warping my thinking. I don’t want to start my PhD in this mindset, which means I have 6 months to make a big change to my self confidence. I would really appreciate any advice.",

Lots of proposals being rejected, having scary emails concerning unsuccessful lab work, to data results constantly fluctuating.  It's honestly just insane how you plan to follow one path, yet life completely throws you in a completely different one. You really can't predict or analyze how your graduates will go, your results and communications are constantly fluctuating it's insane.\n\nI don't really have anyone else to share this with. I thought I'd be nice for others to bring their perspective concerning their graduate studies. Mine was completely different to what my undergrad self intended it to be, and now looking back... these emails are really giving me goosebumps.",

Despite having applied to other universities (mainly as backup), my main goal would have been to continue in my University's Combined MS/BS program so I could graduate in 1 year as opposed to 2 years for every other program.\n\nHowever, of the MS CS programs I applied to, a few were European, as I am a dual EU/USA citizen through my ancestry so I was hoping I could take advantage of the reduced prices of MS programs for EU citizens. Having now actually been accepted to a 2-yr Masters program at Utrecht University in Game and Media Technology, I am now heavily considering the European MS program as an alternative but I am concerned as to whether or not this would limit my ability to get a job back in the USA in a more general SWE role.\n\nTLDR: What to employers think of an EU MS in Computer Science, and is it seen as less prestigious (than a US MS) to larger software companies like MAANG+ in the USA in SWE (or even more specialized XR or Graphics) roles?\n\nAlso would it be possible to get a US SWE internship in between semesters at an EU school?",

        "text": "Hey all, I know this has probably been asked a thousand times before, but I really would like to hear from other grad students about some specific things surrounding moving states for graduate school.\n\nI've already been accepted and have decided to attend a grad school out of state, and for reference it's about a 17-hour drive from where I currently live. Me and an old college buddy have already agreed that we will room together so that part of moving has been taken care of.\n\nI know the wisest advice I could follow now is to start looking ASAP and keep applying for apartments but I honestly don't know if I could afford to sign a lease in the next three months, as the city I'm moving to is highly populated and metropolitan (the downtown area has almost 13,000 people living there). I think June or July (the term starts at the end of September) would be a more realistic time for me to do that but I know that apartments off-campus will be snatched up quickly. It's tough because I need to be able to travel to the city in question, tour apartments, have enough to put a deposit down, and still have livable funds leftover. Has anybody else moved much closer to their term's start-date? How did it go? Any advice from that perspective?\n\nI have also seen a lot of posts advising to ask grad students who already live in the area for some tips and advice, but how does one go about doing that?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

Do you all have advice for what to start looking at when it's clear your teaching needs improvement? I'm going to go over one of the other instructors slide decks for the units bc their students did really well and I might ask him for advice but I'm at a loss because I got feedback from an observation that my explanations were clear and the biggest thing I needed to do was slow down and be more personable, which I don't think should have had that devastating of an impact on exam scores.

I have posted this in a couple subs but just did not get a whole lot of interaction... \n\nAnyways, I love academia, always have. I am currently getting my master's in public administration. My undergrad school is ranked much better than my master's, but my master's is affordable and I am walking away debt free. When deciding to do the MPA i thought it would be a terminal degree for me, but now that i am back in school and learning amazing things I have really been considering getting a PhD in political science. A couple of my professors have really encouraged me to do so as well as. A lot of my course work is more closely aligned with a political science degree. I am currently waiting to hear back if one of my abstract's has been accepted at APSA. My research interests revolve around political economy and social capital. I was feeling really optimistic about pursuing a PhD, but am so unsure now. Keep in my mind, although I would love to get into a top PhD program it is not the end of the world if I don't. My main dream with a PhD would be teaching like most people. That being said, I would be so content teaching at a CSU or just state school. Like I am not really interested in brand names and \"top universities\" for teaching, coming from a rural area I would love to give back to those communities and avoid the snobbery of top places (no offense lol). So my questions are...\n\n1. Do i have a better chance of landing a professor job if my goals aren't working for a top university?\n2. What the actual f\\*ck can you even do with a political science PhD if you don't go into academia?\n3. If you have an MPA, what are jobs you found in the field that aren't miserable desk jobs?\n\nThank you so much for reading this and helping me! I am not looking for hopeful answers, just realistic. No one in my life or family has gotten a PhD so I am extremely new to this entire process and would love some help.",

        "text": "I graduated college less than a year ago (May 2022); and my undergraduate experience was already screwed up by COVID-19 - I was forced to skip out on a full year before returning to Senior year because the US did not allow international students to take hybrid classes and my university was not offering at least 3 in-person classes for me during the 2020 - 2021 lockdown. So I got to watch all my friends graduate without me; I did qualify for an accelerated Master's Program in Economics and I was accepted but I opted not to pursue it due to COVID-19 and feeling that I did not want to stay in Fordham for both undergraduate and graduate school.  \n\n\nAnyway, I somehow managed to get a short-term contract at the World Bank since they hired people from around the world, and if I work for the World Bank in a full-time job for about 15 years I am eligible for permanent residency (green card). For all intents and purposes I really want to stay and live and build a life in the US (especially now with geopolitical events in SE Asia). The problem is that I don't have options for employment in the private sector because the H1-b process is absurdly random and difficult; and the World Bank and IMF have outright told me that I can't get a fulltime job without AT LEAST a Master's Degree (it's already brutally difficult for me to get even a short-term contract role, let alone a fulltime job); and even this employment is not guaranteed.  \n\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Master's Degree in Statistics or Data Science (an MBA or Master's degree in economics isn't very helpful) but I have checked that I did not take enough undergrad courses in Math or Computer Science to qualify (at least in the US). I'm fairly certain that my math skills and coding skills are nowhere near good enough for grad school (I struggled for a 3.60 gpa even before COVID-19)  \nI'm honestly totally lost because I'm being forced to prepare for grad school so soon, just after I managed to find something solid career-wise (I'm 23 turning 24). Otherwise I have to go back to the Philippines and I probably won't have an opportunity to immigrate elsewhere anymore.  \n\n\nAny advice for my circumstances?",

        "text": "Hi, so I've completed all of the coursework for my master's in computer science. However, I haven't started the thesis. I have done a lot of background research, and I wrote a proposal draft, but it needs a ton of revisions. I am also working full-time. \n\nThe problem is, I was originally on the non-thesis track. This is because my end goal isn't to work in academia. I want to be either a tech artist, or a theme park designer, and do digital art + writing novels + coding my own video games as a side gig. Nonetheless, I had to switch tracks at the last minute. \n\nMy lab couldn't fund me, because it's a very popular lab (3D Computer Graphics), so I didn't do any research for the first two years. Instead, I was just working part-time as a web developer. I switched to the thesis track last minute for 2 reasons:\n\n1) My advisor basically said that doing a thesis and research was an expectation for his students. (I made the mistake of not talking to him much earlier in my academic career.)\n\n2) I got hired full-time as a tech artist, my dream career, at my goal company. I didn't expect to get hired before even finishing school, but I did. The thesis track meant that there was 2 less classes to take, so I foolishly thought that this would be the easier option! \n\nNow, I am totally overwhelmed. I need the 40-hour weeks because I am out of cash and I need the benefits -- my university's insurance is really bad. Plus, it's my dream job, and I'd like to stay here for a very long time. I consider this job more important than school, as it was my end goal, though I still want to finish my M.S. \n\nBut add 15-20 hours per week of thesis work on top of that, and I'm just burned out. I started doing background research for the thesis in Fall 2022. Thought I could finish by this spring. I was wrong. My research area is computational fluid simulation, because I love watching water and learning about how it behaves. But this requires a strong understanding of physics and differential equations. I only have a math minor -- thus, this is very challenging for me. It took me a long time to complete my background research and proposal draft. As a result, I probably will have to extend to a fourth year. \n\nAll I want to do after working 9 AM - 6 PM is write novels and make art. I want to be creative, but I just end up coding and researching from 7 PM to bedtime, and every morning before work, and each weekend. Plus 8 hours of code per day at work. I love coding, don't get me wrong, and I love my research area, but this has totally drained my soul. \n\nOn one hand, I already have my dream job, and even though I love what I study, I am exhausted and miserable...so why continue? But on the other hand, I've been working hard for 3 years, and I want this degree. Plus, I know my company was excited when hiring me, knowing that I was working on an MS and supposedly close to completion. \n\nIf I continue and finish this degree, I think I have to dial back the intensity, and give myself time to be creative. I do exercise daily and sleep a reasonable amount, but even so, I'm out of gas. If I stick it out, how can I get through this? Any tips are appreciated!",

I'm just trying to understand what options are out there for completing Grad school. From what I've heard, there are people who go to Grad school full time, and some will talk about it as if they are taking a break from their full time job to go to school. How do people do that? Even if you can afford to not have a job for a few years or more, how do people manage to get back into their previous job or field? Do employers excuse not working for those years because you were in Grad school?\n\nWhen I was an undergrad I really liked the idea of going to Grad school in a much better college than the one I got into. My ideal colleges are ones out of my state. I have ones in my state I like as well, but they're hours away. I know people don't really stay on campus in Grad school, but I assume people still have to go to classes there and get to use the campus correct? Does this mean that if I continue working at the job I have, I'm limited to the colleges I have in my area, or doing all online classes? I just wonder how people did this before covid when online classes weren't as common. Or do people get a different job in the area that they're going to school? What happens if they can't find a job in that area? For me I'd rather not do it entirely online because even though I know Grad school is pretty different from Undergrad, I'd still like to make up a bit for the lack of college experience I had in undergrad.",

        "text": "Hi all! I recently got into some excellent PhD programs. My background is mainly quantum information (e.g., simulations, algorithms), but I have also worked on computational physics projects. In grad school, I have two options: continue my work on quantum information or shift to computational physics applied to materials science.\n\nI'm somewhat pessimistic about the future of quantum computing. Although it is an exciting field,  there is an enormous expectation that won't be matched by the actual scientific progress anytime soon. I'm pretty sure the quantum winter is coming. The overall enthusiasm (and research funding) probably won't be great in the future.\n\nEven though I'm not that excited about computational physics applied to materials science, it does seem interesting enough to me. On top of that, I would acquire some valuable skills that would allow me to shift to other fields or do industry if necessary. For those reasons, I'm gravitating toward computational physics at the moment.\n\nSo here's the question: does this line of thought make sense? I know people say that we must follow our passions in grad school, but let's be honest: the overall future of your field matters a lot.\n\nTL;DR: incoming PhD student choosing between quantum computing and computational physics. The latter seems better because QC funding will probably shrink in the future.",

        "text": "Hello! I'm preparing to apply for clinical psychology master's programs in Canada for the 2024/2025 year. Every school highly encourages disclosing what external funding (ie., NSERC, CIHR, SSHRC) you applied for in your applications. However, I'm really confused about this process since I won't be admitted into a university yet and will not have been accepted by a supervisor??\n\nThis makes sense to me in terms of PhD applications, however at the Master's level am I expected to have my entire thesis laid out at the time of applying to programs? Furthermore, NSERC instructions say that you can only list max. 3 host institutions in your application. Clinical psychology is HIGHLY competitive so I will be applying to &gt;3 universities. Do I need to take a leap of faith, list my top 3 schools and pray I get accepted into one of those?\n\nI would love some assistance on how to navigate this. I unfortunately don't have any friends or family who have pursued research careers and I have been out of undergrad for 2 years and am struggling to find someone who can bring clarity to this.",
