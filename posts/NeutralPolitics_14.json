Dating back to before the 2016 election, Donald Trump has been a critic of Amazon, at one point commenting that his election to President would [cause Amazon problems](https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/703296870521528320)\n\n3. Donald Trump has criticized the Washington Post for its negative press coverage of his administration, referring to it as [\"Fake News,\"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/880049704620494848). The Washington Post is currently owned by a holding company that is [owned by Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post). \n\n4. Immediately following Trump's recent tweets, [Amazon has lost nearly $16 billion worth of stock value](http://time.com/money/5225281/jeff-bezos-donald-trump-attacks-amazon-twitter/), which impacts Bezos personally.\n\n5. One of Trump's main criticisms, his belief that the USPS is losing money in it's package deal with Amazon, [has been debunked](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/trump-usps-postal-service-amazon-losing-fortune/).\n\n6. While sitting Presidents have [clashed with businesses](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trumps-attacks-on-amazon-break-with-history-of-presidents-keeping-hands-off-2018-04-02) in the past, the severity and frequency of these attacks is unusual.",

North of 20% of each party would be upset if a child married someone from the opposing party and north of 40% believed the opposing party posed a threat to the nation.\n\nI don't have a good answer for how we got here, and hope others do. A couple suggestions I have seen:\n\n* Increasing job polarization ([St. Louis Fed](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-2013/job-polarization-leaves-middleskilled-workers-out-in-the-cold)), slowing expected economic growth ([St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1CTMLR)) and an inability to keep up with faster growing competitive nations like China ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-us-vs-china-economy/)) has led to a desire to avoid \"paying\" for relatively less advantageous economic conditions ([\"The Economic Decline of Empires\"](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Economic_Decline_of_Empires.html?id=TQ_-GgrX3FMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button) by Carlo Cipolla, an Economist, on p.13)\n* Most millenials (61%) get their news through Facebook, in sharp contrast to previous generations (39%). ([Pew](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/millennials-political-news/)). They are also relatively likely (26% of all users, with higher figures for those in each political party) to remove political influences (in the form of others) who they disagree with ([Pew](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/)). Coupling this with Facebook's questionable news quality ([Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-fake-news-google-facebook-0904-story.html)) it seems younger generations, through Facebook, are likely to see radical, lower quality news and have more ability to remove disagreeing political influences than in prior decades when Facebook did not exist.\n\nWhat other reasons might there be? What other evidence for and against the above is there? ",

[It's not clear whether they can/should and so the court has decided Puigdemont has to remain in prison, but expressed doubt regarding the extradition](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/puigdemont-extradition-bid-may-spark-long-german-court-battle):\n\n&gt;“The warrant has some points indicating that under a thorough review balancing the legal issues, the extradition may have to be ruled illicit,\" the court said in an emailed statement. \"But it’s also not obvious that the warrant fails to state\" any crime at all.\n\nIn order to extradite him, the charges against Puigdemont have to be considered a crime in Germany. \n\n&gt;Under the rules for the European Arrest Warrant, there’s a catalog of offenses for which countries must extradite, such as terrorism, human trafficking or child pornography. Rebellion isn’t on that list, so the judges need to determine whether the charge against Puigdemont is also a crime under German law.\n\n&gt;The comparable crime of high treason under German law requires violent acts or threats to use violence, said Otto Lagodny, a professor of comparative criminal law at Salzburg University. Since Puigdemont has avoided being associated with violence, the court may have to block the extradition, he said.\n\n[Here's a German source (in English) echoing the same sentiment](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/carles-puigdemont-should-not-be-charged-with-rebellion-a-1199969.html). And [here's the article of the German criminal code (in German)](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/81.html)\n\nMy question is what if a German state tried to secede, without any force or violence? The whole state simply stops listening to the federal government and does its own thing, what then? [The Grundgesetz doesn't allow for a state to simply split from Germany, the Constitutional Court stated this last year](https://www.thelocal.de/20170103/bavaria-must-remain-part-of-germany-says-top-court). Is there an article in German law that \ndeals with this and the consequences for the leaders of this peaceful rebellion? Have there been any precedents for this in German or European history? \n\n\n",

[Starts on page 2201.](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf)\n\nNow, there is concern from [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) on this matter.\n\nMy understanding is as follows:\nThe CLOUD act allows a foreign government to request and receive information from US-based companies and even wiretap foreign citizens within the US as long as they have entered into an agreement with the US. There are basically no checks on this agreement process and they do not seem beholden to our privacy laws.\nNow at first glance the law seems benign to US citizens (though potentially concerning for some others). \n\nThe loophole that seems to worry the EFF and ACLU is that the law only seems to care that the foreign governments target foreign citizens. But there are no provisions safeguarding US citizen's data during this process. So Foreign government A can seek information on Foreign citizen B, and that foreign citizen just so happens to be involved in some way with US citizen D. Well now that foreign government has information on citizen D and as they aren't American citizens they aren't beholden to the Fourth amendment. So nothing stops them from sharing that information back to the US law enforcement who just so happen to be interested in citizen D for one reason or another.\n\nWorth noting that even FISA [has a provision which says FISA isn't allowed to target a foreign citizen in order eavesdrop on a American citizen without court approval.] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/6304/text)\n\nSo for me the main question is: if the above scenario happened, would US law enforcement be allowed to use the data given to them? Or is it still illegal under the 4th amendment? Does the Comity Analysis provide any significant protections here? In this case my understanding is the Comity Analysis lays out guidelines on what items should influence the decisions of the the judicial with respect to foreign governments.",

        "text": "John Bolton was announced as the new National Security Adviser yesterday evening. \n\nBolton is well-known for his past support for unilateral military action, most notably the Iraq War (and has recently argued for a legal case for [preemptive strikes on North Korea](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374)), and an overview of previous positions shows him to have been in favour of relatively unilateral and interventionist policies in the past.\n\nAs such, I have seen a lot of political commentary decrying his appointment as the making of a [new war cabinet,](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/379858-dem-senator-on-bolton-hire-trump-is-lining-up-his-war-cabinet) and voicing fears that his appointment may lead to either deterioration in relations or outright military conflicts with the likes of Iran and/or North Korea, as well as a general retreat of the US from multilateral rules-based international institutions, such as the UN. Some commentators, however, argue that Bolton's more forceful stance [would have been more appropriate in the handling of some issues](http://www.atimes.com/article/bolton-appointment-means-tougher-stance-iran/), primarily in the Middle East and could [toughen up US' position vis-a-vis Iran, Russia, and possibly North Korea.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-iran-russia-are-the-biggest-losers-from-john-bolton-appointment)\n\n\nAre these fears justified and is Bolton really such a dangerous person to have in this capacity in this administration?
