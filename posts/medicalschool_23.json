I have personally seen/heard multiple students make comments like this on social media and in real life. \n\nOf course on the surface level this idea is fucking stupid because who would advocate for their own job to make *less* money but that’s beside the point of this post. My point is to say that if you hold this opinion, you probably never actually lived in   a situation where you didn’t have enough money to make ends meet. instead you virtue signal from your ivory tower about how you could *totally* be happy without money to pay back your loans, save for retirement, help your kids go to college etc. \n\nNot to mention— all of the medical students who got into medical school despite growing up poor should just go fuck themselves because they’re being greedy to want to be able to finally provide a good life for themselves and their family right? People who left their families in other countries to make it as a doctor here should just be grateful to make $60K resident salary for the rest of their life?\n\nI don’t get it man. End rant lol",

Unforeseen family circumstances have derailed my step studying and it’s really stressing me out that I now have to time crunch preparing a presentation and study in a shorter amount of time. I understand losing out on this resume item hurts but I also know a low step 2 might be a deal breaker and really want to prevent that. Is it going to look really poorly and hurt my chance of matching at this home\nprogram if I withdraw? I could ask the resident to be a substitute presenter as he is attending the conference for something else as well. My concern is that the PI will ask why I’m not presenting (as I’m sure he will also attend) and I’ll look bad like I couldn’t handle the workload or something. On the other hand I feel like I might just be overthinking and they wouldn’t care at all.

I just cracked and was balling my eyes out, hyperventilating. I checked my stress on my watch and it was right on the red end, as far as it could go. I hate PBL (case based learning). I'm really bad at spelling (dyslexic) and I am in a constant state of terror that I'll have to go to the bord and fill things in. The spelling gets even worse when I am stressed. Our PBL sessions are 6 hours a week and I don't learn anything from them. I just hate them. \n\nThat's all. I know other people feel dumb as well but I am extremely average when it comes to books. Really emotionally intelligent. I raised myself pretty much from the age of 13 because my mum (never met my father) died due to 20 plus years of IV drug use. \n\nAnyway, this forum makes me feel less alone.

Before I talk to my doctor about it, I'm curious about what other medical students who use or stopped using think of it, especially if you're \"borderline\" ADHD.\n\nI am well aware that Adderall can be abused.

I especially hate (at my school at least) how the evaluations are tied to our grades. I got my evaluations back from my Ob/Gyn residents and most of them were extremely cruel and harsh. There were a few good ones, but they that said the complete opposite of what the negative evals said. I hate the subjectivity of it all, and there are times where I believe they want us to feel like shit. I feel like sometimes evaluations are ways for residents/attendings to make themselves feel better by taking it out on the medical students knowing damn well it affects our grades which impacts us when we apply to residency. We even have residents/attendings who are known for ALWAYS giving bad evals, so you have to brace yourself for the shit they’ll throw at you. Like why I’m the world would you do that across the board? Or they’ll just give poor grades and not. Write. A. Single. Damn. Thing. What’s worse is when they’re fake and say “oh good job you did so well and were a model medical student” only to say in their eval “poor fund of knowledge, can’t critically think, etc.” I understand that it’s important for us to have feedback to become great doctors, but do they really have to be such assholes? Most of the time I would say they’re  fair in what they say and how they grade us, but whenever you get ones that you don’t think accurately reflect your performance then you question your worth as a medical student and a future doctor. They have to remember what it was like when we were in their shoes, so why continue the chain of giving poor evals for the Hell of it. At least with exams they’re objective and you have an idea what you’ll get. But some of these evaluations can be fucking wild cards, and you never really have any idea as to what they think of you until you read their evaluation.",
