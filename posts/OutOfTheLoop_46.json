Or is it just me specifically being targeted by the YouTube algorithm? In the past few days I've been seeing them all over my recommended videos.\n\n(I admit they're kind of fascinating to look at although they're still sort of in the uncanny valley sometimes.. And even when they're past it, it sort of terrifies me to know that technology has become capable of essentially producing alternate realities in media, basically indistinguishable from actual reality.)\n\n[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZrHnf3ne9Y&amp;ab_channel=demonflyingfox) another variation with 'as an 80's Yakuza film', but it follows the same general pattern.",
