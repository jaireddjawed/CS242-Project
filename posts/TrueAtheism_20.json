        "text": "So I have felt for my whole life that people don't actually believe what they say they do. When I encounter a religious person suggesting a particular ideal I, deep down, cannot actually grasp that they believe this. Like I almost feel like they are all making the correct noises to remain in their social group but none of them actually believe it. \n\nIntellectually I know that people actually believe these things and they are willing to die or kill for them and legislative agendas that are completely unconscionable are pursued that could only originate form a sincere believe. But still, in the face of all that I have a difficult time truly coming to terms with the fact that people believe things that are so clearly not true.\n\nI have studied religions for the last 20 years out of fascination for these concepts that, taken at face value, are clearly untrue or logically unsound under the assumption that there was simply some fundamental truth I was not comprehending. All that has done is make it harder for me to comprehend how people could actually believe what they claim to believe. I guess this makes me the Atheist equivalent of the Christian claiming that Atheists believe in god but deny it anyway out of spite.\n\nDoes anyone else have this surreal experience where you are completely incapable of believing that people believe what they claim to believe? \n(I wonder if I could pack believe more times into a sentence)",

I explained to her that the only common element among atheists is that they do not believe in any deity, and any/all beliefs after this are no longer prescribed by atheism.\n\nHowever, when she reached a question about atheism's beliefs concerning the afterlife, and I said atheism has no unified belief regarding the afterlife, she insisted she couldn't just put that as an answer (The report asks similar questions about different beliefs afterwards as well). Am I incorrect in saying that all ideas of the afterlife are consistent with atheism, as long as they do not involve the existence of a deity? Is there a study of beliefs among atheists floating around somewhere out there, that might further shed light on POPULAR beliefs held by atheists instead?\n\nThanks in advance for your help, I myself am an atheist.",

I have attended this school for nearly all of my life and stopped believing in Jesus around my freshman year. However, I plan on finishing high school here regardless of my beliefs (or lack thereof). The problem is that I have to take Bible as a class this year and the next in order to graduate. As a final paper in this year's bible class, I have to write my testimony. I'd rather not say I'm agnostic/atheist because I don't really want to get kicked out/shunned so do you have any advice on how to bullshit this? I thought \"if anyone can help me exchristian can.\" I'm not asking you to write my paper for me (but hey if that's your jam go nuts) but I would appreciate advice/thoughts. \n\nBasically, the instructions say \"This experience can be a conversion experience but it does not have to.\nIt can be about any experience where God has worked in your life or in your family. Your paper needs to be a minimum of 2 pages and written so you could use it in a Church meeting if ask to. This lesson is to help you learn to articulate your faith. There is an attached testimony as an example (if you guys want it, I can provide my teacher's example tomorrow).\n\t       It’s:\n1.\tPersonal\n2.\tTells a story\n3.\tUses Verses for support\n4.\tPresents the Gospel.\"\n\n\nI'd say around 95% of my class will be going with the \"I was born in a Christian household but didn't make my faith my own until I was __(age)\"\nI appreciate any advice/thoughts.

        "text": "I was having a discussion with a Christian friend the other day regarding studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of prayer. While he readily admitted that such studies have shown prayer has no tangible effect on the world, he immediately retreated to the stance that God is unwilling to intervene in circumstances where the outcomes are measured because, \"He will not be tested, and doesn't wish to interfere with our free will.\" Regardless of your thoughts on the existence of free will, I'm sure many of you have heard similar objections that feel, to me anyways, like very convenient cop outs allowing one to hide behind faith despite the lack of any real evidence supporting one's beliefs.\n\nLater that night, I thought of a question I should ask him that I'm not sure I've seen proposed on this or similar forums. I feel like it could be adapted to any of the Abrahamic faiths, but as I am most familiar with Christianity, that's where I'll start. I imagine more knowledgeable users here can help me out with additional elements of Christian doctrine applicable to the exercise, which is basically as follows:\n\nSuppose you are an unscrupulous individual who wishes to start a sham religion to gain power and influence, one that worships a god you know full well does not exist. You are able to attract some followers with idyllic platitudes that appeal to humanity's collective desire for peace, justice, and hope for a good life, but eventually your followers begin to ask questions about your god's apparent lack of action and concern for the well-being his followers. They turn to you for answers. Can you think of a more effective way to keep your followers than to claim that they must remain faithful, that your god does not wish to violate their free will, and that he will not submit to tests to prove his existence. If you cannot think of a better way to prop up your scam, does it bother you that your religion relies so heavily on these same strategies that could be used to obfuscate the sham?\n\nObviously, this is relatively unrefined, but I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions the community could offer. Thanks for your help.",

        "text": "So a fellow atheist friend of mine brought up an interesting point a little while ago. According to him, it's futile to discuss the actual scriptures with a theist, because they will find some way around whatever point you're trying to make. \"You're taking it out of context\" or \"It doesn't say *that*.\" The analogy he made was that, \"Religion is a completely liquid concept, and it will take the shape of any container it's put in. I.E., the mind of the adherent. This is how we get different denominations.\" Thinking back to discussions I've had with theists, I have to admit that any time I try to bring up a point of inconsistency or immorality in the bible, the person almost always immediately has some other interpretation, explanation, justification, etc.\n\nI still think however that it has some value in demonstrating that the text can't be taken literally, but I haven't had an opportunity to test this, as I haven't met a literalist to have the talk with. I also pointed out the fact that so many interpretations for so many different points of view can be drawn from the same source is a good reason why we shouldn't be leaning on it as a source of truth and moral guidance. He then countered and said that by that logic, we should chuck out the US Constitution, to which I responded that the US Constitution is less ambiguous and it's amendable. Pronouncements in religious texts are not.\n\nThoughts on this? We didn't talk about it beyond that point because the Iowa Caucus was kicking off and that killed the discussion.",

How or why do you deal with feelings of spiritual and emotionally emptiness? How do you make sense of the absurdity of life in the face of so many unanswerable questions? Is this doubt just a phase?**\n\nWhile the freedom is nice in theory, not only am I still emotionally very much held by the deeply rooted remnants of Catholicism, but I am very much lost in it. With Catholicism I had an ultimate goal  and \"true\" guidelines for eudaimonic happiness. \n\nAs an atheist, we are left as sentient apes with questionable capabilities of  free will, dim intellects, and a tentative grasp of reality. There are more unknowns and unanswerable questions than we are capable of answering if humanity managed to live until the final days of the universe. \n\nEven without religion, thousands of secular and corporate organizations compete to supply a sense of meaning. Left to my own instinct it would be a ceaseless urge toward hedonism.  Using my own feeble mind, the best answer seems to be do what makes you happy, which will lead to passing distractions or hedonism of one sort or another. All of which again leaves me rudderless and unfulfilled at the end of the day. \n\nI apologize for being rambling and incoherent but I am quite sick and still called into work. \n\nEDIT: If I haven't replied yet I will come back tomorrow, very tired and still sick.

        "text": "One of the reasons my parents (especially my father) strongly believe in God is because they believe my birth was a miracle. \n\nMy dad says that - \n\n1) Before I was born my parents lost a baby boy and were told they could never have more children (my mother later admitted the doctor actually said it would be \"difficult\" not impossible). \n\n2) He read a bible verse saying if you have faith and believe \"ask and it shall be given onto you\".  He also read something about \"famous biblical person\", whose name meant \"gift from God\".\n\n3) He believes this was God telling him if he had faith they would a baby boy and have to call him \"name meaning gift from God\".\n\n4)  9 months later I was born on Father's Day, thus proving I was Gods gift to my father for having faith. \n\nAs an atheist I believe it was just a coincidence. The doctor said it would be difficult to conceive, not impossible, and I didn't exactly come out unscathed (I have Aspergers, ADHD, depression and severe anxiety). It's also likely that my father wanted another boy, since they lost one, hence \"God\" told him he would have a boy. He had a 50/50 chance of being right.  The incident gave him hope, which led to them trying to conceive. Being born on Father's Day was a coincidence.  If anyone has a better explanation I'd like to hear it?\n\nWhy do I care about this?  Because I've been questioning my gender identity recently, and I'm fairly certain they won't take it well if I say I'm a girl, when \"God\" told them I'd be a boy.  I'm an adult but still rely on them for support due to my disabilities.\n\nEDIT: I should add that I've already come out to them as gay and an atheist. They didn't take the gay thing well but they didn't disown me or anything.  They didn't seem hugely upset about me being atheist and not going to church.",

I understand that religious people often justify their beliefs on basis of faith or unexplained questions about existence/creation/etc. Do you think that they view their religion as the most likely truth? I find this possibility difficult to accept, given that even if their is a true religion (which in itself I find absurdly improbable) the odds that they have the correct one, or even practice it in the correct fashion, is very unlikely. \n\nI would love to see a study where religious people are asked to rationally rate the likelihood that their religious views are a 100% accurate view of the universe. \n\nI understand that this likely varies from individual to individual, and I probably put more thought into it than most of them have, but I'm curious to get some opinions all the same.

Recently I have made the decision to part form the church and would consider my self an agnostic atheist. Now because i attend a christian school you could say that I'm screaming internally most of the day. Yesterday I had a really good conversion about truth and as my bible teacher put it \"we need to show the world the truth about god and the true religion\" now after a nauseating hour in class I talked to my classmates about truth. my friend made some good points about what true truth is according to the bible but as we know the bible is far from truth. I made the point that truth is totally subjective and has nothing to do with what is true truth in the world. think of it like this, a christian is trying to convert a Muslim now this Muslim is totally stuck in his ways and wont budge to what the christian says and vice versa. to both the Muslim and christian they are right and the other wrong. no matter what evidence you bring to a religions person suggesting that there probably is no god they wont give you the time of day. i am interest in what the internet thinks about truth in the world and i need advice on how to make a good point on truth and belief so that i may save my close friends form throwing their lives away searching for a nonexistent god. \n\nsorry for the loads of run on sentiences but I'm tired and just don't care lol ",

Today I had a discussion with a Muslim girl about the existence of god and why she believes in it. \nThe conversation was fairly \"typical\", she brought up the usual point that you can't disprove the existence of God and how science can't explain certain things. I answered her questions saying that only because we can't answer certain questions doesn't mean that we have make up answers without any evidence. I told her that believing in God is the same as believing in magic or unicorns, both things are possible but very unlikely and unreasonable. Now, at a certain point she said \"I am sorry but I don't know enough about my religion to continue this discussion\". So I said \"But you still believe in God and consider your religion untouchable?\", getting a \"Yes\"  to which I replied with \"Don't you think are being superficial? Why do believe in something which you haven't even a good understanding of?\". The conversation continued with her pointing out how she felt \"attacked\" and I was extremely rude since I said her religion is wrong. The conversation ended after a while with her saying \"I don't want to discuss this any more!\". Two people sitting with us also commented  that everybody is allowed to have an opinion and how me saying that her religion is wrong was extremely rude (although I justified my statements). \nIs being completely honest with religious people is the right way to debate with them? Is there a more convincing and less \"aggressive\" approach that leads to appear less condescending? ",

I'm an atheist and anti-theist; I find it abhorrent to think that what's wrong with things that are *wrong* is that God doesn't like them - that **why** it's *wrong* for someone to kill me is because that would be damaging God's property.\n\n*However.* On atheism, is it *really actually* morally wrong for you to kill me at a whim, or is it an arbitrary cultural invention? If there is a smooth sequence of evolution, then at what moment in the billion-or-so generations from amoebas to myself exactly does it become *really objectively* wrong to kill? \n\nIt looks that, morality-wise, theism vs atheism is rock vs a hard place. In neither can I find a justification of what is intuitively obvious - that it is really *really* objectively wrong for someone to kill me at a whim, regardless of anyone's opinion or (gulp) enjoyment generated. Wtf?\n\nEdit: So, from the feedback I've gathered, it seems like the suggestion that it is *actually* wrong to shoot people is no less than *offensive* on this sub. And I'm even a fucking atheist myself, but what kind of a mind twist does it take to reach that? I begin to understand the fear that the religious have. To you guys yuckiness to murder is the same cultural thing as yuckiness to homosexuality and should be similarly overcome if you want to be a true rational thinker. Really? *Really?*",

        "text": "I posted this in the other atheism subreddit, but this subreddit seems to be better about conversation.\n\n\"Life sucks and then you die\" feels like the motto of life to me right now. I haven't held any religious beliefs for a long time. I haven't felt any hostility toward religious people, because for all I know, they could be right (does this make me an agnostic instead?).\n\nLately life feels empty. For some back ground, I was ill for awhile and recently got an okay from my doctor to start working again. I'm a millennial, my college debt isn't insurmountable, but everything is expensive so I'll probably be spending my life making enough to get by. I feel like I'm doomed to work 40+ hours each week, and then when I die, it'll all just stop. I've never been the type to take to feel fulfilled by hobbies outside of reading, gaming, watching tv and movies, so there isn't much to my life.\n\nI like to write, and I like to write about fantasy worlds. It's been making this life feel so boring. I've just got the one life, so I can't take too many risks with it, or it just ends abruptly. Traveling is expensive, and tedious so I don't think I'll ever experience it. I wish I could say for certain that I knew there would be a life after this one, to spend traveling on the Tardis, or playing fetch with my deceased dogs for eternity, or even playing capture the flag in Valhalla.\n\nI'm almost starting to envy religious people. I myself believe that most organized religions are rooted in control, and as such do not wish to join any of them (I freely admit that this could change in 5, 10, 45 years), but I can see why people would. I can see how it would be comforting to feel that a deity has left you guidelines for how to live life, or make your place in the world. I can see finding comfort in believing in afterlife, or seeing that you have a community to fall back on.\n\nFor an example, my old boss is part of a religion I think of as flat-out bizarre, however she was a very kind and wise person. We talked about religion, but when we would exchange the traditional \"what did you do last weekends?\" and she'd talk about gatherings or events, I could see how she felt happy and comfortable with where she was in life. I also heard the tale of changing religions from an old professor (not done preachily or as a way to convert, within boundaries appropriate to the conversation).\n\ntl;dr I'm all over the place with this post, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that my life feels very empty. I don't see myself joining a religion, but I can see how others have filled similar voids with religion. Any advice on how to feel like life has meaning?\n\nAfter reading the responses and PMs, (some good, some trolling) and doing some thinking, I decided that I might as well still believe in an afterlife. Worst case scenario, I die and there's nothing there. Big whoop, I'll be too inanimate to be disappointed.\n\nOverall my questions to other atheists are this, how do you cope knowing that this life can be such little reward for so much crap? What's the point of being alive at all if all humans are going to do is follow orders, and do paperwork? Where's the adventure and zest in life?",

        "author": "PerfectGentleman",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/44tncc/regarding_inalienable_rights/",
        "text": "A few days ago I had an interesting yet frustrating discussion about inalienable rights with other atheists on Facebook. \n\nThe discussion sparked from a snarky joke made by a popular ex-Muslim about Ted Cruz saying that \"Our rights come from the Creator\" being similar to what ISIS might say. I thought the joke was not very thoughtful, since there is a similar statement in the Declaration of Independence, but the discussion that ensued was strange to me.\n\nSome *atheists* were arguing that rights do not come from man, because if they did, then man could take them away. \n\n&gt;If you believe in innate rights, they do come from the Creator. It doesn't mean they come from the Jewish, Christian or Islamic (Turkish in 1776/1783/1789) God, or the Gods of Olympus - just that they do not originate solely with the whims of humans.\n\nThey seemed to be offended that anyone could think that rights weren't innate.\n\n&gt;Man can violate them but they still exist. They are always there regardless of how they're recognized or ignored.\n\nI asked where they existed and one of them responded, \"in morality.\"\n\nAfter being challenged by those of us who don't believe innate rights exist if they're not protected, their reaction was very puzzling:\n\n&gt;What I really believe is at play here is contrarianism. Post-modernist deconstruction of the most easily defined truths for the sake of appearing sagacious.\n\n.\n\n&gt;This is why Atheism is so dangerous. It gives uneducated and ignorant people a license to remain uneducated and ignorant. Most Atheists have the same self-righteous a-moral approach as Fundamentalist Christians and Muslims. They believe in absolute truth and condemn anyone who doesn't accept their version of it. There's no room for free thought or critical thinking.\n\n.\n\n&gt;I can only imagine that the men of The Enlightenment would be hanging their heads in sorrow that we are even discussing this three centuries later. Civilization begets decadence. Decadence begets complacency. Complacency begets self-destruction.\n\n.\n\n&gt; I believe you misunderstand the definition of the key words at play and are disputing accepted philosophical ideas. \n\nIt sure sounded like they were offended by the blasphemy of our disagreement with established philosophy. Ironic if you see that they were complaining about the same thing, but it reminded me of the same kind of backlash I get from religious people.\n\nMy views are that in nature/reality no right is innate. If you study nature and biology and evolution you will realize that nature is apathetic to your rights. If humans or rational sentient beings that valued human rights didn't exist, then they wouldn't exist either. Does this mean I don't believe in morality? Absolutely not.\n\nThey argued: \n\n&gt;This idea is the very foundation of liberal, secular, Western societies.\n\nIf you happen to be creating a new society and you can get all the founders to agree on basic \"innate\" rights then that's great. You can call it a \"declaration\" too if you want. But you can't pretend that these rights magically existed without the founders agreeing on them. Even then, a lot of rights might not exist until later on (women suffrage and slavery anyone?).\n\nI personally believe that all humans *should* have many basic rights. But this is based on my personal morality that comes from my empathy and reason. Thankfully, most people's views seem to overlap on basic morality. Unfortunately, in places like North Korea and Saudi Arabia, a lot of people don't have a lot of the rights that a lot of us take for granted.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this?",

There must be a first cause in the cause and effect chain within the brain during the decision making process. If the soul existed, then one could have free will, as a soul would be above physical law. It would be able to be the \"first mover\" in the cause and effect chain. If decision making is limited only to physical matter, then there can be no \"first mover,\" as we know that nothing can move itself. So I've come to the conclusion that free will does not exist. We are all just \"meat robots,\" as Sam Harris asserted.\n\nAnyway, my problem is that I cannot understand how anyone can truly and meaningfully love another person if one does not possess the free will to do so. Without free will, love ultimately boils down to a chemical response created by evolution. It is inherently meaningless. I find this rather depressing.\n\nAs atheists, how would you define love in a relationship? And how can you value it?",

They expanded on Mark to add greater support for the resurrection, but they were stuck with the women finding the tomb. Sure there are lots of inconsistencies that they don't appear to have been too concerned with, but erasing the women completely would likely have been too drastic, even for them. In that sense, they had to work with what they were given.\n\nSurely, this has been proposed before, but I just haven't seen it. Or perhaps there are flaws in this hypothesis that I've missed.

Then Christians built on it. Added some new characters, and changed some of the lore around. Then Muslims added a few more characters, and once again changed some lore.  \n  \nThe best analogy I could come up with is comparing the religious origins of each branch with Lord of the Rings (LotR).  \n  \nThe LotR books are all established. The story is set. Has a beginning an end, and even some other lore that the original author wrote. Similar to the Bible. What if someone today was to write Lord of the Rings 2: Electric Bugaloo (LotR2)? Would it be accepted as part of the original lore? What if a large portion of people loved it? Would that new lore become canon?  \n  \nIs the Quran and related texts the LotR2 to the Bible's LotR? I have a hard time saying that LotR2 is canon, and should be treated as the same story anymore. I don't understand why people say the Islamic texts are canon to the original material.   \n  \nMaybe I'm just a lunatic for thinking Hobbits would be good break dancers on account of their low centers of gravity, while trying to compare fictional beings and their relationships to each other.

        "text": "I live in a backwater country where the best free education [from Latin, 'e ducare', to lead out (of darkness)] in my area is given on the proviso that there are daily prayers to Yaweh and the creationist myth is taught as fact (the United Kingdom). My 8-year-old daughter has said that she wants to be christened. \n\nIdeally I would like her to think like us, but I have to concede that this is a long game. It took me until I was 14 to work it out for myself. I decided I will not share my views with her as I can't compete with 7 hours per day of pervasive inculcation and am likely just to give her views to rebel against.\n\nSo I'm going to not only play the long game but also use some reverse psychology. If she is going to be christened I can at least make sure she learns the theology behind it.\n\nSomeone on this sub said that they found the best antidote to Christianity is the Bible. I won't let her pick and choose the best bits but play along with the charade and take her to Church. She knows she can expect to go every week once she is Christened. \n\nHer first visit, she found 'boring'. Hopefully this threat will make her think more carefully about what it is she chooses to believe and why.\n\nFor my part, I found it fascinating and enjoyable.\n\n* Welcoming people  \n* Coffee and cake  \n* Audience participation in the singing    \n* Good mix of traditional hymns and catchy modern tunes  \n* Amazing architectural space  \n* Wonderful organ music  \n* Interesting stories  \n\nI've been among worshippers before. It always puzzles me to see people engaging in what must appear to them to be a dialogue or some other attempt at communication with an invisible being. I look around, some of these people appear utterly convinced in this endeavour. As they take communion, I wonder if they think they are going through motions or if participating in the symbolism (this is not a transubstantiation denomination) helps them to 'get into' what they are doing. How do they not feel silly, those who are dressed in white robes and carrying sceptres? And the congregation who give the stock replies to the incantations?  \n\nAll in all, I found it a very enjoyable experience, aside from the cognitive dissonance I experienced as an atheist. I've gone recently to mosques and sikkh temples to show my daughter that there's more to religiosity than what she is force-fed at school. At each, I've been struck by the humanity, kindness and welcome displayed to us. As long as I keep remembering \"it's a trap!\" I can quite enjoy the experience.",

        "text": "Hello. I just recently made this account so that I could get some advice from all of you on how to cope with atheism. I am currently a junior in high school. I am 17. Two years ago, I began to doubt my faith (Catholic), but I remained optimistic about God's existence. At first, I realized that the universe could come into existence without God. This did not disprove God's existence for me, but provided an equally possibly alternative. It is, however, where my doubt began. I decided to keep looking into evidence for and against God. I began to lose my faith as I searched and as I thought more about it. I finally lost all faith when I came to reject free will. I became a hard determinist. I came to the conclusion that there can be no God if free will does not exist, as the entire religion of Catholicism falls apart without free will (morality, sin, etc.). I find too much evidence against free will to believe in it. I believe that one needs a soul in order to have free will, as the chain of cause and effect cannot go back infinitely when one makes a decision. There must be some first cause in the decision-making chain, a cause that is unbound by physical law, namely a soul. Like I said, I find too much evidence against free will (which I will not list here).\n\nAnyway, after losing faith in God entirely, (about 2 months ago) I was crushed and overwhelmed. I panicked. I came to realize how insignificant I am compared to the vastness of the universe and realized that I would have no lasting impact on it. I realized that when I die, there will be no afterlife. It'll just be like before I was born. It scared me so much and it scares me out of my wits still. How do you cope with this fear of death? I cannot bear it. Every night, before I go to bed, I think about it. I feel so nauseous I think I might throw up. Sometimes my body shakes with fear. \n\nI desperately want to believe in God! But unfortunately, I do not think that's going to happen. For this reason, I decided that I would attempt to accept it. Only... How?",

        "text": "Towards the end of my church going days, I began to notice that what we were taught in church often differed from what the Bible actually said.  For example, we were taught in church that the devil lied and tempted Eve, and God cast Adam and Eve out of Eden for their \"disobedience\".  But when I read it myself it sounded more like the serpent was telling the truth (i.e. they wouldn't die if they ate the forbidden fruit) and God kicked them out because he didn't want them to become immortal. In other words, God lied so they wouldn't eat the forbidden fruit and gain God-like abilities.  It reminds me of how the gods punished Prometheus for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humanity. The gods don't want to share their power.\n\nAlso, the whole idea of the serpent being the devil made no sense. Why would God punish all serpents by removing their legs if it was the devil in disguise.  Did he not know?  But he's all-knowing!\n\nI just found in interesting how pastors seem to spin Bible stories so they make sense. Has anyone else noticed this and id be interested in your examples.\n\nEDIT: I thought of another good one.  We were taught that when the Israelites were captive in Egypt, the pharaoh allowed them to go free but then \"changed his mind\" (because he was evil of course). So God had to send his plagues to force him to change his mind. Um no, God hardened pharaoh's heart and made him change his mind, then he sent the plagues to show how amazing he was.",

        "text": "I've been talking with a close Catholic friend of mine, and we have been conversing about morality in religion. Her stance (like many other religious people's) was that if there aren't absolute values and moral obligations, then morality has to rely on relativism, which both her and I do not agree on. I explained that certain cases need to be assessed individually to see if the act is morally wrong (e.g. aborting a baby because the mother's and the baby's life is at stake VS aborting a baby just because you don't feel like having the baby). However, there are absolutely immoral acts that should be forbidden, like sexually assaulting a small child. I tried to show her how religion saps the ability to take these things into considerations and only allows one to see things in absolutes. Unfortunately, she has been having a hard time grasping this idea, because she believes that there needs to be integrity and authority (this obviously being God) to define what is right and wrong. It sounds like she does not trust in humans to critically think and rationally outline what is moral and what is immoral, which is understandable due to our track record in our history. \n\nIs there any other way to approach this topic to open up her mind a little more?

Instead, I will address a common Christian refutation of this argument.\n\nThe Christian will often say, \"God wills an act because *He* is good.\" This is an attempt to escape the horns of the dilemma; essentially, the Christian is proposing that the dilemma is actually a false dilemma. This only brings the problem a step backwards.\n\nThe Christian must explain why God is good. If goodness is simply God's nature, then it is redundant to say that God is good (it is like saying 'God is God'). The Christian must answer how we can know that God's nature is good. Additionally, the Christian must accept that if God behaved differently (e.g. rejoiced in torturing infants), then he would still have to call God good -- because it is simply God's nature. I don't think he would like to accept this conclusion.\n\nWe are led to this: if the Christian says that God is good because of His characteristics (to quote William Lane Craig: \"God is by nature loving, kind, fair, impartial, generous, and so forth\"), he must ask himself, \"Are those characteristics good because God has them, or does God have them because those characteristics are good?\"\n\nIn conclusion, the common refutation attempted by Christians fails at dismantling the Euthyphro dilemma. To summarize, \"Are *acts* good...\" becomes, \"Are *characteristics* good...\" when the Christian says, \"God wills something because *He* is good.\"",

I'm just noticing even when i'm looking about other things that include some christianity like Rosicrucian, or Free Masonry I find those actually appealing and I've spoken to Free Masons and I respect them and yet if I tell the average american christian then I am now going to hell. I'm also going to hell if I take some advice from other religions like buddism. I've also realized that the reason i'm not going after what I want to do with my life with 100% effort is partly because it's questionable and the pressure of the majority of American christians seem to all have the same exact belief system. Part of me thinks they're wrong but another part of me thinks since it's the majority of a religion believing the same thing, maybe i'm the one in the wrong. \n\nI'm sorry if I ended up just ranting but the main reason i posted this is because i'm curious if any current atheist felt this way as christians or if it was more logical in the sense there was no evidence. \n",

        "text": "I see theists in debates often claim that: objective morality exists, and God is it's source. A point of evidence commonly used to support this is normally the fact that all people/cultures exhibit similar moral judgements (don't murder, steal, ect). The theist concludes by stating God is the best explanation for why everyone agrees certain acts/behaviors are wrong.\n\nI've often thought (but yet seen) a strong argument against this claim would be sociopaths. Some, small percent of people through what appears to be a combination of genetics and environment, diverge from \"normal\" moral considerations and appear to be totally, or near totally, self interested and lacking empathy i.e. sociopaths.\n\nThis seems like overwhelming evidence for an evolutionary source of human's moral inclinations or tendencies. If God were the source, we would expect them to be actually universal, not just pervasive. If they evolved as a function of group cohesion/cooperation, we would except evolution to always develop a few \"free riders.\" One would also expect the genes that cause sociopaths tendencies to require environmental conditions to \"turn on.\" I would expect evolution would push for exactly what we see, a small percent of us raised in extreme conditions, deviate wildly from standard moral inclinations. \n\nFor example: Born in a harsh environment where caregivers are abusive or neglectful? You likely are not in a social arrangement where reciprocal behavior is common. Turn on the sociopath genes, turn off empathy, this will increase your chance of survival. However, don't always turn on the sociopath genes, or you will miss out on the many benefits of reciprocal behaviors. This fits perfectly with our understanding of psychology and evolutionary pressures. \n\nTherefore, given the existence of sociopaths, evolution seems to have a better explanation for our observations of morality in humans: empathy and \"moral\" behavior exists on a continuum, people raised in abusive/neglectful environments are less likely to exhibit \"moral\" or empathetic behavior.\n\nNote, this has nothing to do with if objective morality actually exists. Philosophers, starting with a few difficult to challenge assumptions, \"all unnecessary harm is wrong,\" have long been able to devolve objective moral systems without appeals to the cited universal experience of empathy.    \n\n\nEDIT: Anyway, was wondering if anyone had thoughts on my idea, or heard someone more intelligent make it better.

In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.

        "text": "Hello fellow atheists. I have been an atheist for about 15  years now. I did a lot of thinking in my teenage years (and much thinking along the way too) and came to the conclusion that there is no God, there’s only nature. The laws of nature govern how things happen, and when we die, that’s the end. Our brains deteriorate and our memories and our personalities cease to exist. I could not conceive of the idea of a soul: I see the brain as physical, and we can see that people with brain damage or the elderly with Alzheimer’s disease can lose their minds or turn into different people. I look at everything like a domino chain reaction, I believe in determinism. Without really having free will (or hardly any at all if you do believe in it) then the idea of good and bad, and sin sort of become relative and almost arbitrary. I view humans as no different than other animals, programmed to do two main things: survive, and procreate. The main difference is we have a lot of free time because our intelligence has found ways to store food and keep danger away, and provide shelter. The everyday concerns of regular animals are taken care of with us. We then have the ability to have discretion in our decision making, and that’s where ideas about morality came from. Animals don’t have the luxury of discretion, they have to follow their instincts every time because their world really is life and death all day long.\n\nAnyways, I have believed this for years without any problems whatsoever. In fact, I took pride in my beliefs. Deep down I do think I still wanted to believe though, in a God and in an afterlife. I wanted my life to have purpose, I didn’t want to just die and that was it. But I accepted the reality I believed and I never had a problem with it. \n\nUntil recently. My friend’s mother passed away a few weeks ago and I’ve been feeling disturbed ever since. I can’t shake it. It happens at night near bed time: all of the sudden the reality hits me so deep and it panics the hell out of me. I legitimately feel like I’m going crazy and that I’m just a small step away from being a lunatic walking down the streets screaming at passersby. I have had a few moments like this before, but nowhere near as strong as a panic attack. For 15 years I have believed in what I believed, and I had hardly any problem with it. Now all of the sudden the reality is hitting me in a way it never has before, and I feel like if I can’t shake this soon, I’m going to have to get on some psychiatric medication to try to forget about it and just live day to day like a normal person. \nLife is so short. 10 years goes by in the blink of an eye. Your whole lifetime does. One day you realize you’re at the end of your life and can barely even remember most of it. Life has so much meaning, there’s so much love, especially In your family. You love your parents, and they love you. They give you a sense of confidence that everything will be okay, and you believe it. Nothing is more important than life. At the same time it’s hardly worth anything at all, according to the universe. Our lives essentially get bulldozed over and replaced with something entirely different. \n\nI think one thing that bothers me about it is the fact that so many people think there is a God an afterlife. It doesn’t bother me in the way of thinking they’re stupid. It bothers me in a way like they’re being tricked. It’s like I want everyone to wake up and do something about this serious death problem we have. We’re all marching towards the cliff. But then again there is nothing we can do about it, so being awake to reality really doesn’t change much or help any.  \n\nThe question of death is always kicked down the line. Children ask about it, “don’t you worry, you got a LONG LONG time before you have to think about that”. They accept it and move on. Then in teenage years and early 20s the question resurfaces. The answer this time is more or less the same “It’s normal to have those thoughts, but you’re young, you have plenty of time to figure that all out”. Then when you’re old and dying, you ask the question again. By this time, it just makes sense that you’re going to die and it’s not even worth answering. “Well you’ve lived a long life, it’s your time”. Then question is never answered, it’s just kicked along until you’re too old and senile to care anymore. It almost feels like a sick prank. We’re brought up, we’re told there’s meaning to life, we’re made to believe there’s something to all this. And then it’s all taken away and then world moves on without us. \n\nI’ve dealt with a lot of problems but this is the one I can’t resolve. I’m starting to realize that even though I was an atheist for 15 years, deep down in the back of my mind, I must have still held out a little hope. And I think that little hope must have just gone away, and I feel cold and empty and alone. \n\nHow do you deal with the panic of knowing our fate? How do you feel alright with the fact that no one cares about us – if you happen to ingest some deadly bacteria you’re going to die, if you happen to get hit with a steel beam, you’re going to die. We live our lives with this moral code, but nature knows no such code and will kill you in an instant if that’s what the laws of physics determine. There’s no “court of nature” where an advocate talks about what a good person this is and how it would be a tragedy for them to die so young. I’m seeing just how cold hearted nature can be and it terrifies me. If you think about it, it’s trying to kill us every day. We don’t realize how often we avert death because we’ve been so skilled at doing it that it’s second nature – washing our hands, going to the doctor, looking both ways before we cross the street, etc. \n\nI want to believe, I really do. I want there to be a God an and afterlife. And I’m trying to be a believer. I want nothing more than for that to be true. But the more I think it through in my mind, the less it makes sense to me. The more it makes me panic again.  I wish there was a way to put this in a good perspective where I can both see reality, and feel content with it as well. If anyone has any advice I’d appreciate it. \n",

        "text": "a follow up to the https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2acnb6/update_gf_went_to_avatar_course_last_year/\n\nI have just moved out of a house where the 'manager' of the shared house runs these Avatar Courses. I thought it was some new age self help bullshit - harmless. I was so wrong. Check out the links from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_Course\n\nThe person managing the house was selfish, manipulative, and dishonest. She had no concept of sharing. Although myself and another house mate were paying all the rent, we were not allowed to eat in the dining area, leave our dishes to dry, sit or put personal objects in the lounge area, play radio or other noise out loud. Every time I cooked a meal, she immediately burned incense because she did not like the smell. Although we live in one of the hottest and most humid places in the world, we were not allowed to use the aircon until we successfully argued persistently that the house was unliveable. \n\nHer behaviour pointed to me that this Avatar course she was into did not seem to be doing much good. For eg, if someone is into fundamental Christianity, you would expect attempts to be a good person and evidence of some moral compass, but not this person. I have since found out that some of my friends know of her. They would cross the road to avoid talking to her, and would try to get as far away from her as possible. If you live in this hot humid place, you know who I mean.This is a small Australian city, and reputations get about. \n\nThis person works on a casual basis, she is going overseas at least every two months (funded by my rent payments no doubt), to 'help out' at Avatar courses. She has guests in the house doing her rebirthing courses - but she did not keep milk (stole mine) to make them cups of tea/coffee (and of course during this time, we were not allowed to use the kitchen, talk, make noise etc).\n\nYou may be thinking how did I get myself into this situation. The trick with Avatar and its followers is that they are taught how to sell very well. So they sell you (in my case, paying the rent), and only over time do you discover the truth. I wonder how they can do this and retain personal integrity, considering that Avatar followers seem to be unable to discern the real truth within this cult. Perhaps through continual self-deception?\n\nI believe this person is mentally unwell. She seems to have symptoms of Orthorexia nervosa and Narcissistic personality disorder that are being 'masked' not treated with this Avatar nonsense. She needs real, meaningful help.\n\nThis Avatar course is deceptive and misleading. Keep away from anyone involved in it. The fruits of the course are evidenced in it's members' behaviour. Read the critical commentary on the web - its all about money.\n",

        "text": "I'm hoping to start a discussion on multiculturalism from an atheist/rationalist perspective. I'm hoping to keep this as politically neutral as possible so, let's just assume (regardless of whether you believe it to be true) that immigration is fine economically, and let's ignore current issues of mass migration to talk about it as objectively as possible.\n\nThe two views we hear the most often are ones I'll term \"traditionalist monoculturalism\" and \"hard multiculturalism\". The traditionalist monoculturalists believe in the inherent superiority of their culture and traditions and believe that those from other cultures either shouldn't live with them, or should conform to their culture. The hard multiculturalists believe in different cultural groups living side by side, by their own different rules, leading to a kind of moral relativism.\n\nTraditionalist monoculturalism is, as far as I see it, ridiculous, but I've been somewhat critical of hard multiculturalism too. At the moment, I feel stuck between two different views. The first is Kenan Malik's, which I'll call \"rationalist monoculturalism\". Malik rejects traditionalist monoculturalism and multiculturalism, saying that we should criticize all cultures from a rationalist/atheist perspective and look to create one rationalist culture. The second is Johann Hari's, which he calls \"liberal multiculturalism\". Hari argues that it should be up to the individual to decide how they live their life; he opposes monoculturalism, but also the kind of multiculturalism that allows for Sharia courts and the like. I feel like I agree with Hari more when it comes to things like food, art, clothes, etc. I really couldn't care less if people are eating food from a different culture or anything like that, and I think that kind of multiculturalism definitely enriches society. However, I agree more with Malik when it comes to things like religion and spiritual beliefs. Cultures in that sense - all cultures, not just those in a minority in a given place - should all be criticized from a rational point of view. Anyway, that's how I see it. I'm interested to know what others on here think.",

        "text": "So my deeply religious friend and I were discussing why I'm not a Christian anymore. I used to be deeply religious as well and so our conversations cover a lot of topics. One was the reliability and historicity of the gospels and modern day \"miracles.\" I have my own thoughts, but I wanted to share this with you guys and get your thoughts as well. Let me know what y'all think!\n\n\n\"Hey man, sorry to bring it up again, and over messaging, but now that I think I understand where you're at, and thinking about the question of God from that perspective, I think I have the (a) biblical answer.\n\nIf we take any of the gospels for a sliver of credibility, they depict Jesus showing his authority by the working of signs and miracles. In Matthew (Matthew was also an apostle of Jesus), some Pharisees, who claim Jesus is casting out demons by the name of Beelzebub, ask for a sign. This is his response.\n\n“But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.”\n‭‭Matthew‬ ‭12:39-40‬ ‭ESV‬‬\n\nSo there, Jesus is saying that, for some people, the only sign they will see is his resurrection. Now this is an argument about if he is the promised messiah, but I think it applies to if he is God, or if he has the authority he says he does. I also realize that you can't actually watch Jesus be resurrected, but historically, if it can be shown, I think that might do the trick too.\n\nRZIM (Ravi Zacharias International Ministries) is the nationally renowned Christian apologetic group that I was talking about. The main two guys that I have heard speak representing them have sighted the historical certainty of not only the life and death of Jesus, but also his resurrection. I have not yet to looked into this, but plan to soon. You may have already looked into this on your own, but I would ask that you heavily consider it. If he was raised from the dead, no matter how circular or faulty the rest of it sounds, that gives him sizable credibility.\n\nAlso, the modern day church is supposed to have some form of ability to perform signs. As part of the great commission in mark, Jesus says\n\n“And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.””\n‭‭Mark‬ ‭16:17-18‬ ‭ESV‬‬\n\nNow obviously this isn't being done widely now, and I don't have a lot of answers for that, which doesn't make this quite as compelling of an argument, but I will say I doubt most Christians in America would be free of skepticism if told to attempt this (including myself), which may be a part of it. Regardless though, the friend that showed me this is the same friend who watched a man's leg grow when praying for it. He also told me stories of him praying over boil/ulcer things and watching them shrink to nothing, and praying for pain and it going away. So there are at least some stories of it happening.\n\nSorry this was super long. I hope it is at least of some value to you, and that you (and I) find truth.\"",

That we need to thank the lord for his love and blessings (my grandma just died. Can we not?) \n-\tWe had to sing church songs that, again, praised the lord\n-\tHe emphasized over and over that grandma is with the lord and if we want to see her again, we have to accept him into our hearts or we will suffer a spiritual death (aka a permanent death). \n-\t“If [grandma] can speak with us right now, she would definitely say “I am currently with the lord and it is the most beautiful place. My dear family, please believe in the lord so that you can see for yourself what a beautiful place this is.”” (Are you seriously putting words in her mouth like that?)\n-\tHe gave a history lesson of how Christians were persecuted over 2000 years ago in Rome, and the lord told them to have faith no matter what. I have no idea why was this relevant. \n-\t“It’s not enough to have a strong belief. People who buy lottery tickets have a strong belief. People who strap explosives to themselves have a strong belief. We must have a strong belief with GOOD EVIDENCE. The lord’s words are the GOOD EVIDENCE that we need for our belief.” (wat) \n\nMaybe this is a common thing and should be expected, but it just bothers me for a lot of reasons.

He accepts the labels agnostic, nontheist, atheist and others. He has expressed reservations about such labels for his lack of belief in a God, however, as he sees them being used in the service of \"pigeonholing\", and prefers to simply be called a skeptic. He also describes himself as an advocate for humanist philosophy as well as the science of morality.\n\n---\n\nSo /r/TrueAtheism, I want to know your thoughts on Michael Shermer and this interview with Dave Rubin.\n\nI find myself agreeing with Dave Rubin a lot, I think his show is fantastic and he chooses his guests wisely. I'm also glad Michael was interviewed because I don't think I've seen too many atheists in the public eye that used to be hardcore religious people. (Maybe I'm blind to them.)\n\nEdit: I kind of want to get /r/DaveRubin going. ~~I'm not a mod on it but hopefully I can land that soon.~~ It is live!",

I've always thought it was a confusing and counter-intuitive distinction. The topic is further confused when we consider that there is a widespread misconception that most atheists are actually positive atheists. It seems to me that the fact that there is this distinction furthers this misconception. \n\nShould positive atheists really be considered atheists? How did this distinction come about? ",

At some points I caught myself smiling at Rubio's presumptions (such as God becoming a man, suffered, died, etc). Yet at other points I appreciated his willingness to repeatedly state it was the man's right to believe or not believe whatever he wanted. Still, it is obvious Rubio was pandering to the clearly Christian crowd. More so, the fact his faith would affect his decision making process in the Oval Office is of great concern to me. Sure he says he won't push his religious ideas on anyone else, but how can one say that if it means their faith would diminish or demolish laws and procedures diametrically opposed to it, such as right to abortion and birth control?\n\nAs the man posing the question says, there are some calling Rubio the \"Pastor in Chief\". Clearly he is thoroughly devout. With the rise in atheist and non-religiously aligned voters, the tactics used by Rubio and the rest of the GOP are quickly becoming archaic in similar fashion to their religious institutions. Yet still it persists and still it ends to thunderous applause.\n\nI find election seasons terribly troubling. Each cycle becomes worse than the last. Why can't *most* Americans vote for the most qualified candidate, rather than the most devout? Why do *most* continue to gobble up the clear pandering these people do? Instead of concerning ourselves with \"eternity\", why can we not concentrate on making the here and now the best it can be?",

She didn't take it very well and some talks about evolution and my general problems with religion.  She believes that, with faith and prayer, one day I will see what she sees.  I've tried to explain to her how I see things and she just doesn't see how anyone can doubt the bible.  She thinks that I am just going through a phase.\n\nSo to appease her I went with her to talk to one of the leaders of her church at a Starbucks, and the same talks of evolution and religion ensue.  The only piece of evidence they can bring up is that they feel God and know it's real.  I tried to explain to them that if they were raised Muslim or Hindu, they would believe that those religions were true.  A patron of establishment overheard our conversation and decided to join in on the Christian side.  I was getting frustrated because I had 3 people trying to explain to me why God would create a species of bacteria that eats nylon 6000 years ago, and not using any logic or doubt.  At the end of the conversation (almost 3 hours long) there was absolutely no progress, or maybe just negative progress.\n\nFast forward to today and she tells me that when she has kids that she wants them to go to church and be raised Christian.  I try to tell her that I don't want to but my kids through that indoctrination and that they won't need to go to church.  She insists that going to church will make them good and happy people.  I try to tell her that I am a good and happy person without God, but that's just a coincidence.  Like earlier, she says that she knows one day I will change my mind, but I really have my doubts about that.\n\nThank you for any advice you can offer.  This sub is what gave me the courage to tell her in the first place.  ",

Aspects of it even seem consistent with my catholic upbringing, even though I was born into that faith so no recruitment needed. Am I the only one seeing parallels?

They are also described by survivors as very vivid and very lifelike, even \"more\" real than waking life as described by some. \n\nThis brings up an interesting conundrum to us, the atheist—if NDEs are likely to occur during brain death, and feel indistinguishable from any reality to the experiencer.... what about when the person **ISN'T resuscitated**? To that person, from their own perspective, it goes from \"Oh shit I'm about to die\", to a very realistic experience that is associated by many with aspects of an afterlife, followed by a ceasing of their consciousness forever. *To that person,* this is **INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM AN ACTUAL AFTERLIFE.** So in otherwords, for us atheists, if this is the brain's common reaction to imminent death, many of us may go into the void thinking.... we were WRONG. Unless we get our brains obliterated in the process of our death, I suppose.\n\nJust very interesting to contemplate. If anyone here can weigh in how likely it is that NDEs are experienced by a majority of even large minority of people just before brain death, that'd be awesome.",

Say you were having a discussion with your Christian friend and posed this question. So far as I can tell, your friend is going to go with one of four responses:\n\n**1) \"God would never ask me to do such a thing!\"**\n\nWell this one's easy to refute because, according to the Old Testament, god asked Abraham to do just that. So your friend would just be plain old ignoring his holy book if he went with this answer.\n\nFurthermore, if he displayed shock at the suggestion that god would command such a heinous act, wouldn't he be acknowledging that there is some system of morality outside god's word? Most Christians at least claim to believe morality is dictated by god, so they should in theory be alright with carrying out any act they believe god commanded of them. And if god's word is the moral truth, why would there be any ethical restraints on what he may or may not command? This is where you might suggest that morals actually come from empathy, and not from a mouth no one has ever seen or heard.\n\n**2) \"I wouldn't do it.\"**\n\nIf this is the answer you get, you've pretty clearly proven to your friend that he follows a different system of morality than just \"Obey god's word.\" Considering Christians at least claim to follow the orders of god, this one would probably be a tough pill for your friend to swallow considering all plausible deniability for him has gone out the window.\n\n**3) \"I would do it.\"**\n\nCongratulations! You've just gotten your friend to admit he'd murder his child because of a voice in his head! Now you've made your friend look like a monster, you asshole. But let's be honest, very, very few people will answer this way.\n\n**4) \"I...uhhh...well you see...\"**\n\nThis is probably going to be your most common answer. And by that, I mean no answer at all. This is probably where you can just paste in the other non-answers you've gotten when having these discussions with religious friends and family. Your friend might inform you about how faith is complex or how god works in ways we don't understand or perhaps he'll offer up a moving personal anecdote or high moral platitude meant to make you feel like a dick for asking such tricky questions.\n\n***\n\nSo how would you answer were you a theist? Is there any \"acceptable\" answer?",
