But the machine may not have been dialled in properly so who knows. Maybe they are ok \n\nSorry if this is a bit rambling.

For the first week or so, they were blooming quite nice and evenly with 2:1 water to grinds at 45 seconds in a Chemex. The resulting brews were so delicious! \n\nHowever the last week or so, I've noticed a harsh/almost-burned smell coming from the beans that wasn't there before and the blooms are SO lumpy and 2-3 times larger than previously. The brews have become much more acrid/smokey/bitter and much less tasty. I took a break from them for 3 days and suddenly, terrible. What gives?? I've started double blooming just to get the bed to flatten and reduce some foam.\n\nI store them in an Airscape at room temperature, out of the sun, and freshly grind them using an Ode2 at a medium grind setting (though I've been playing with coarseness to get brew time where I want it). Every other variable has been roughly the same. So why the sudden change in the bloom and how can coffee suddenly become gassier? Afaik, they should have released most of their C02 by now.\n\nTLDR: My 2-3 week old beans are suddenly causing a much harsher brew with less delicious subtle flavors and blooms are 2-3 times their original size and very foamy.",

I was thinking something along the lines of an electric hot plate/burner with temp control so as to not ruin the flavor?\n\nEven at that point, I'd like to know if the coffee community feels it's a good idea to reheat the coffee (so to speak) by putting an already poured over pot on a burner of 200° and if anybody has any suggestions on which ones to use (assuming it's a good idea)",

After having instant almost all my life switching to real coffee I thought would be a game changer except it was kinda anticlimactic because they hardly differ in taste.

Regardless I have stuck with my French press and really tried to get all the techniques right to see if it's a me problem or not, but idk I still don't seem to get much out of it. At one point I think I started liking my real coffee but then I realised if I liked it cuz it's supposed to taste better or if it's actually good.... I think I maybe loosing my mind 🙃",

I like my coffee black, as an espresso or in an (oatmilk) cappuccino. I love the taste of strong coffee, without being overly bitter of acidic. When I try out specialty coffees that are supposed to be berry-like (Guatamalan, Kenyan, etcetera), they are just too sour to me. I like bolder flavours: chocolate, oats, caramel.\n\nIt feels like the offerings for bold coffee is limited (if I want to go beyond supermarket coffees). What should I look for when I want a coffee suitable for both espresso and drip coffee? There must be more flavours to explore!",

I am brewing using the single cup V60 technique by James Hoffmann. \n\nRatio: 15g coffee to 250 g water (1:16.67)\n\nV60 technique: 45 sec, 50g water bloom, pulsing 50 g water at 5g/s. Pour complete at 2mins. Gentle swirl at end for flat coffee bed. \n\nWater: straight off of boil since its a pretty light roast and I dont really have a temp controlled kettle. Pour is using a gooseneck kettle and I pour at the rate Hoffmann suggests. \n\nIssue: My JX-Pro with the grey dot isnt perfectly calibrated. The adjustment dial is at #4 at zero. Considering that, I have tried grinds at grind settings 30,32,35,37.5 and yet the drawdown times are between 4-4:30 mins which is much more than the 3-3:30 mins suggested. With the offset at zero, this would be a grind setting of about \\~28-33 which is in the range that 1Zpresso suggests for pourovers. At the finer end of the grind, after drawdown, the bed looks quite slushy and the taste is a little bitter for sure and at the coarsest end I have tried, taste is a bit flat but not too acidic yet. \n\nShould I keep going coarser still to bring the drawdown time down or is this what people have observed with these beans and grinder?",

I am thoroughly impressed by the Ratio 8.\n\nI had been avoiding it because of what seemed like a high price, but looking at all the lesser machines I wasted time and money with, I wish I bought it sooner., The Ratio 8 is built like a tank, simplicity in action, and makes a perfect cup.  I've tried it with Chemex filters and its inset, Hario V60, kalita wave, Kalita classic,  a Kone stainless steel mesh, and more.  If you pay attention you can agitate, or just let it do its thing.  The only thing I would want to add is a autostart timer, but I could see how this might break up the aesthetic. \n\nPictured setup:\n\nFellow Ode Grinder Gen 2 (awaiting/debating the sold-out SSP burrs)\n\nAcaia Pearl S\n\nBottomless Scale and MIIR canister\n\nVarious Fellows Canisters\n\nW&amp;P Porter full ceramic lined tumbler\n\nRatio 8 thermal in matte black on ebonized wood.  \n\n\nOthers I still use:  \n\nMy classic setup is a weighted and timed hand pourover adding in a fellow EKG and simple carafe, but sometimes I dont have all the time to do it and want a coffee now.\n\nOrphan Lido 3 hand grinder - still the best for getting a grind exactly where I want it and replicating it later\n\nBaratza Encore - this thing won't die, burrs still look good, at the office\n\nBonavita BV1800 Brewer -- not bad actually, just ugly.  Made coffee only slightly less good than the Breville list below.  Good for my office space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I've owned but no longer use:\n\nBreville Precision Brewer with pourover insert -- this was broken by movers but was a very good machine TBH.  It looks like all thing Breville which wasn't really my style.  I almost bought another but glad I took the leap to the Ratio.\n\nTechnivorm moccamaster -- So wanted this to make good coffee and it just doesn't for me.  Cannot dial it in for a single large cup or for a pot.  I like the switch setup (thermal carafe), but hated pouring with that same carafe; would spill at the end no matter what. Would not buy it again.\n\nBrim coffee maker -- looks nice, but hot garbage.  Horrible hotplate design, cheap glass carafe, thin insulation, and made horribly burned plastic tasting coffees over and over again.  Should never have bought it.\n\nBreville Smart Grinder Pro -- Nice enough with fairly consistent grind, no need for its bean hopper, never used any timing function on it.  Loud and messy.\n\nBaratza Sette -- bought when first came out.  Didn't do well for pourover, messy, weight/timing inconsistent, sent it back\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the future:\n\nI have the space and the clearance from my spouse to upgrade again  -- I have a full espresso setup for her in another room.  The next level will be a plumbed combined bar in my kitchen.  I really want a Marco SP-9 for pourover, a font with cold/hot/sparkling, and a La Spaziale S1 Dream.\n\nThanks for reading",

More or less, my coffee has always tasted the same. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. Even a pricey Ethiopian will basically just taste like a decent medium roast - not tea-like, no fruityness, etc. \n\nThe other day I went to a coffee shop and the barista was making Aeropress for himself. He offered me a small cup for free. It was *amazing* and completely different from anything I've ever made. Like not even comparable at all to the coffee I always make. He walked me through the recipe. I forget the details, but he did the inverted method, with blooming, and a fair amount of stirring. Basically, it was a complicated recipe. \n\nSo this brings me to wonder.. I thought the Hoffman/ Wendlebow recipes were \"simple but make a tasty cup\"? I thought the more involved recipes weren't really worth it? This is what I thought I've read online. But now I'm thinking, I definitely need to go inverted, start blooming.. all the works. Why are these recipes always recommended when I just had a cup of coffee using a recipe that completely blow these ones out of the water?",

        "text": "I started getting serious about coffee last month when I got a Fellow Ode 1.0 for Christmas. It was given to me with a tin of coffee from Williams Sonoma, Peruvian origin. When I first smelled the coffee beans, all I could smell was Campbell's vegetable soup. It smelled metallic, canned tomato-y, with maybe some peas and green beans in there. The smell was so intense that it started to turn into teriyaki beef jerky when I put my face close enough to the beans. I assumed that the coffee had simply gone stale and moved on. I then got a freshly roasted bag of coffee, this time from Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia, and the smell was *exactly* the same. It tasted better, not being stale, but the beans smelled just like the previous ones. \n\nYesterday I opened a bag of coffee from Los Laureles, Honduras, from the same roaster, roasted perhaps 4 weeks ago (at the same time the Ethiopian was roasted), which I was initially excited about because it smelled like peanut butter chocolate with dark fruit notes. Today, it smells just like the previous two coffees, and tastes more or less identical to the Ethiopian one. Roast level was not indicated on the bags, so I'm assuming it's light to medium. \n\nIs this just what specialty/single-origin coffee smells like? In the same way that many beers have the same base flavor of \"beeriness,\" is this something common to single-origin coffees? I would really hate to have a nice grinder only to put cheap dark roast coffee into it, but I still haven't found a specialty/single-origin coffee that I like more than that.",

The best I coffee I can manage has this cloying bitter AND sour taste (that's right, bitter and sour at the same time) which curls around the sides of my tongue. Every morning I make a cup of coffee and I can't get down more than a few sips, blech.\n\nI have a good burr grinder, a Capresso, not the very best but not bad. I have a temperature-controlled goose neck kettle. I only use quality beans, I've tried light, medium and dark roasts.  I vary the grind size and water temperature from 170 to boiling, I've tried many methods of pour over, French press, Aeropress, Moka pot, drip pot. I've tried distilled water, Third Way water, nothing works. I've documented my attempts on a spread sheet to cover all variations. \n\nSo I give up, the Coffee Gods hate me. Until I can afford to hire a barista to train me, I'm just going to buy pre-brewed coffee. I don't expect anyone can help me here, I'm just tired and done and need to vent - I just want a good cup of coffee, is that too much to ask???",

After reading studies on caffeine, anecdotes, and personal experiences, I concluded that the cons out-weight the pros. So, I decided to quite caffeine all together and live a life that didn't depend on coffee. \n\nThe first 3 weeks, I was a zombie and extremely tired. But after that, I slept better than I ever have: lots of dreams, and consistently woke up at the same time every day without an alarm, which I am exuberant about. My focus and memory was as sharp as ever, and my hyperactive tendencies stopped (managed to quite nail biting and mild dermatillomania that started early in childhood). \n\nI stopped taking all caffeine products for one and a half months- This included coffee, tea, hot chocolate and chocolate bars. \n\nSo:\n\nMy school sent me an online module to complete before the first day of classes, so I decided: **Why not get a cup of coffee from Starbucks to see how it goes with the study session, just for fun!** \n\nThe smell of coffee in the Starbucks was marvelous, and I was smiling the entire time waiting in line. I was jolly as I was trying to decide what coffee to get; I settled for a Grande Blonde Roast (light) (360 mg caffeine), with milk, cream, and brown sugar.\n\nTo mitigate anticipated side effects from the caffeine (as it is a stimulant), I took a Green Tea supplement containing 200mg of l-theanine.\n\nI managed to drink half the cup in 10 minutes while I was sitting in the library; And, over the course of an hour, I my chest gradually started to feel warm- It was similar to when I broke my wrist and I was prescribed Tylenol with Codeine. I was euphoric, I felt like I could do anything; I couldn't stop moving my leg, like a dog waiving its tail!\n\nAfter a couple hours, I realized, my leg literally could not stop moving, like restless leg syndrome, my mouth was dry, and I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated. I also noticed, my focus was slightly enhanced, but, my short-term memory and recall was abysmal. I could not even comprehend whatever I was reading even though I could read well.\n\nCoffee and tea is so integrated in multiple cultures around the world that we have unconsciously developed a dependence to it. I will try to never go back again.\n\nI understand my experience has been tainted due to the fact that I haven't had caffeine in a while (elevated side effects), but I have still come to the conclusion that: I will avoid coffee or caffeine products, and I believe my quality of life will benefit: Your's might too.",

        "text": "\nI have been a barista for years and am finally in the position to get my own shop going. I just moved from Washington (where the industry is very saturated for drive thru coffee shops) to Nevada where these stands are almost unheard of outside of the big chains. \n\nAnyways, I am in contact with our real estate agent to find us a location. We’re having to build because the type of structure we’re looking for isn’t available (small, shed like, strictly drive thru) which is no problem but we can’t seem to find a location listed commercially that’s interested in leasing for such a small building.\n\nMy question is, did you go through a real estate agent to find space to lease, buy, or simply contact a commercial land owner with a little extra space and pitch your plan directly to them? I’m tempted to just start contacting gas stations, etc with enough room and pitching the idea that my business can bring them extra traffic. But I don’t know, I feel they won’t take it serious/won’t be interested without my agent. \n\nAny insight is appreciated! Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Hey guys, for the longest time I've been set on the Breville Dual Boiler as my first proper espresso machine (upgrading from a Delonghi automatic) but recently a bunch of posts across Reddit, Facebook, web forums, etc. have me worrying about the reliability and serviceability of Breville. If something happens, almost all repairers won't touch it meaning only Breville themselves need to repair \n\nIs this worry overblown?\n\nI've been contemplating spending more on a \"prosumer\" machine but I'm still not sure as I'm still new to all of this.\n\nIn Australia, the Breville Dual Boiler is $1,000\n\nThese other dual boiler prosumer machines I've been looking at\n\n-Lelit Elizabeth PL92T - $2,550\n\n-Rancilio Silvia Pro - $2,600\n\n-Ascasa Steel Duo PID - $2,630\n\n-Bellezza Bellona - $2,680\n\n-Profitec Pro 300 - $2,900\n\nWhich one of these would suit my needs best? I want some sort of programmability. My wife rarely makes coffee but when she does I want her to be able to use the machine with confidence but I also don't want to have to get the scale out every time I make a coffee. A volumetric programmability is a must.\n\nBasically my question is.... should I get the Breville Dual Boiler or spend more on a prosumer machine?\n\n\n*Planning on pairing with a Eureka Specialista, Eureka XL or Mahlkonig X54",
