From speaking in tongues to the loving a human like incarnation of God with all you heart. So many similarities.\n\nSurely this must have been noted in many places.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/z7slhn/on_the_origins_of_lucifer_a_luciferians_take_on/",
        "text": "# BEGIN:\n\nThis will be a rough dive into history on all 3 scales - Biblical, Occultic, and Historical on the origins of the spirit known as Lucifer, the Light-Bringer, Shining One, Venus the Morning Star. My goal for making this is mostly fun, i kinda hope it helps people in their spiritual path, as I've seen a lot of posts that express confusion on who Lucifer is, but if all it does is give someone a good read, then so be it. Otherwise, I hope this goes well, and I hope you, the reader, enjoy this.\n\n# BIBLICAL:\n\nTo begin, let's first dive into the biblical aspects of the Shining One and how it permeated modern society in a way that cemented his name as a spirit of light - in whatever context that may be. Admittedly, it's a short set of events that led to something much larger. An archetype of \"Fallen Angel\" attached to the concept of the Light-Bearer. \n\nThere is only [1 verse in the bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14%3A12-15&amp;version=KJV) that mentions Lucifer in this context, linked here in the King James Version. [However...](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14%3A12-15&amp;version=ASV) if [you'll](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14%3A12-15&amp;version=CSB) notice [that](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14%3A12-15&amp;version=CJB) most [other](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14%3A12-15&amp;version=NCB) versions of the bible avoid the proper noun Lucifer, instead opting to use \"Morning Star\" or \"Day Star\" - There's a reason for this. The King James Version attributing the fall to an entity named Lucifer is due to the smallest of mistranslations - a capital letter. The [original verse](https://biblehub.com/text/isaiah/14-12.htm) is in reference to a King of Babylon, whose kingdom had just been destroyed, of which bared the _title_ of light-bearer / shining one. We can see this in the original Hebrew, how it doesn't mention the _name_ Lucifer, but \"hê-lêl ben-šā-ḥar\" which, when translated literally, means \"shining one, son of morning\". In Hebrew, this term doesn't refer to Lucifer the entity but rather a planet - [Venus, AKA \"The Morning Star\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology) ). This begins to make much more sense, as Isaiah likening the King's downfall to the movement of the planet Venus, which every night seems to fall from the sky into the underworld. \n\nBut - How did shining one and lucifer become mixed up? Simply put - Early Christians adopting Jewish texts. The [Latin Vulgate translation](https://www.biblestudytools.com/vul/) of the bible, which came about sometime in the [4th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate), simplified this into \"the star that brings the dawn\" - \"light bringer\" - \"luci fera\" - \"lucifer\". In 1611 the translators of the King James Version came across the Latin Isaiah 14:12 and made a connection to the Greek god [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus), I.E. the being that defied deities in order to bring fire and light to humanity, and syncretized and concatenated the two, giving it a capital letter, turning it into a proper noun, and suddenly from a simple insult - \"you were the brightest star and now you've fallen\" - you now have a fallen angel that defied yahweh's absolute goodness. But how exactly did this fallen angel, AKA Venus, turn so evil and \"satanic\"? And where did the other Fallen Angels come from? For this, we have [the Book of Enoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch), which you can read [here](https://www.ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch/ENOCH_1.HTM). \n\nThe book of Enoch is an [apocryphal text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha) which, academically, is defined as a \"work, usually written, of unknown authorship or of doubtful origin.\" and was written around 200-300 BCE. The book of Enoch didn't quite make it into the bible but it was particularly popular with 2nd temple Judaism. In the Book of Enoch we have a chapter labelled [\"The Book of Watchers\"](https://ms.augsburgfortress.org/downloads/9780800699109Chapter1.pdf). In this chapter we have \"watchers\" who were dispatched to earth to watch over Humanity. However, they slowly began to \"corrupt\" and lust for human women, and soon began to create Nephilim with humans. Led by the leader [Samyaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyaza) they defected from God's command and allowed their offspring to pillage the earth and endanger humans. Samyaza and his gang also began teaching humans certain arts, like weaponry, cosmetics, sorceries, and other secrets. This is actually where Noah's Ark and the flood come in. However, focusing on Samyaza in particular its easy to see how the characters and personalities get mixed over time - With Samyaza and the supposed \"Lucifer\" both falling from grace.\n\n# OCCULTIC:\n\nSecondly, we should address the occultic aspects of Lucifer, as it directly relates with spirituality and religion, as does the bible. As far as this goes, this will be much choppier and more sporadic as occult information on Lucifer ranges from Fallen Angel to Mystical Moth God. In a sense, everyone has a different interpretation, including myself. I'll give my point of view when applicable but please, keep in mind, my gnosis is just as valid as anyone else's. Perhaps the most famous example of Lucifer's occultic appearance is in the [Grimoire Verum](https://nekropolis.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GrimoriumVerum.pdf), in which he is listed as a \"Superior Spirit\" amongst two others, alongside various \"Inferior Spirits\". He is listed to appear as a small boy, and when angry, turns red. Remarked as essentially, \"not at all intimidating.\" This is also where his most well-known sigil comes from, the V-Chalice. Many practitioners develop their own sigils for Lucifer though the V-Chalice remains in the public eye, I myself worked out [a sigil for Lucifer and I only](https://imgur.com/a/Nk45uHm) which I now honestly prefer to use. However I've seen multiple practitioners with their own personal sigils which paints a rather laid-back picture of interacting with this deity, with their imagery being more loose and free-form than standardized as the Biblical contexts would. The Grimoire Verum is (arguably and often debated) the oldest appearance of Lucifer as a religious entity, reportedly being written in 1517 but dated to the 18th Century, around 100~ years _AFTER_ the King James translation. There is the [Peter Binsfeld Classification of Demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_demons#Binsfeld's_classification_of_demons), released in 1589, that was part of his own Treatise on Confessions by Evildoers and Witches. But, the fact that this information came from tortured Pagans/innocents who said anything to get free should say enough - I.E. There is no truth in these confessions. Lucifer also makes an appearance in [S. Connolly's writings, in the Dukante Hierarchy](https://demonolatry.fandom.com/wiki/Dukante_hierarchy), listed as an Air elemental with a jovial personality. \n\nThis more laid-back attitude attributed to Lucifer can still be attached to the Fallen Angel motif, without issue, they are not mutually exclusive. However, it seems our friend has has taken a more calm route when given the opportunity to be seen outside of biblical belief. In fact, my own gnosis and other practitioners that I have seen, eventually come to have their [understanding of \"angel\" and \"demon\" dissolved](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/daemon#English), seeing spirits for their \"true neutral nature\". I myself don't believe that Lucifer is a \"demon.\" I believe that there are misunderstandings that led to Lucifer being forcefully given the title of \"demon\" but this does not make him a \"demon.\" He is a Spirit of Light - How you interpret a spirit of light is a reflection of you in so many ways. Some view him as a Fallen Angel, some see him as a Venusian deity, to him it doesn't matter what shape you see him in, so long as his teachings remain the same. And most of the time, [they do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism#Common_beliefs), symbolizing enlightenment, truth, sometimes rebellion, among other generally positive attributes. Obviously the Biblical aspect and the Fallen Angel motif has permeated the occultic view on Lucifer in general, and this is fine, even. His teachings have literally _SHINED_ through to people and focused on positivity and good behaviour. Venusian or Angelic, Lucifer has been a spirit of light for many people in many ways, for many reasons. \n\n# HISTORICAL:\n\nThirdly, we need to dive into the historical aspects because this is where the key to truly understanding Lucifer lays. The unfortunate part is, there actually is not much historical writing on Lucifer due to him being [associated with an inferior planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_and_superior_planets) and thus not venerated like we do today - He existed more as a personification of concepts. Both in the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#Roman_folklore_and_etymology) sense of Lucifer, and even in the [Greek equivalent, Phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_(morning_star) ), who ended up not being a spirit venerated by many, if any, people at all. However, when you begin to paint a picture given the knowledge we have after reading this post, you can start to see that \"personification of light\" actually fits Lucifer perfectly. Fallen Angel, Venusian Deity, or otherwise, \"Spirit of Light\" has rung true for all of them. When we look back in history and observe how the word lucifer was used as the name of the planet Venus, we can begin to see that Lucifer (the deity) encompasses [many concepts from many deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Venusian_deities) that are typically associated with Venus. Such as, but not limited to, Aphrodite, Astarte, Frigg, even potentially a [Canaanite Deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalim) known as Shalim, who the city of Jerusalem was named after.\n\nEven astrologically the symbolism relates to the concepts that Lucifer encompasses, with [Taurus and Libra](https://www.astrology.com/planets/venus) ruling over Venus. The symbol of [libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(astrology) ) being the [Scales of Justice held by Themis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis), the Greek personification of Divine Law and Justice while holding a masculine polarity, and the symbol of Taurus being the Bull holding a feminine polarity. Balance, throughout every lens you look through. The Light-Bringer's ideas and concepts bleed through like the morning sun.\n\nThis is why Venus and the association with the sun are excellent metaphors and concepts to attribute to and with Lucifer, due to the nature of consistency behind Venus bringing the light into view. It's been a motif with Lucifer in all incarnations and aspects, he is, put simply, the Light-Bringer. \n\n# CLOSING -\n\nAll in all, despite the many, _many_ interpretations of Lucifer there is, we should all look at Lucifer's value in the occult and pagan community. I have personally seen Lucifer heal the religious trauma of many people, myself included. Giving us a chance to work and move past negative emotions or associations. I have heard many say that Lucifer feels like a father figure, and that they feel protected. If this spirit is making people feel protected and giving them aspects of life that they did not have before - this alone makes this spirit's worth invaluable. \n\nDespite what motif you attribute to this spirit of light, one thing remains true - He promotes a balancing of energy. Masculinity and Femininity, Strength and Softness, Emotional and Logical, this balance permeates all aspects of life and promotes an equal and thought-out view of your surrounding situation. To me, this is someone worth worship, someone worthy of guiding me.\n\n\n\nIf you have information you would like to share on the origins of Lucifer please make a comment and source your posts, I make no effort to speak from authority and recognize that i do not know everything there is to know. If there is something that needs to be known, then it should be known!",

        "text": "So this was just a thought, but I wonder why a lot of Christians (but maybe some Jews too) are so uptight about sex and even showing a little skin when Solomon, not to mention his father David, was one of the biggest Chad's back in the day?\n\nHe clearly didn't follow the 1 man + 1 woman = marriage teaching. So how do theologians reconcile this apparent contradiction? Does it mean that Solomon was sinning constantly but God blessed him anyways because...?\n\nI know the typical thing is that people say his wives turned his heart away from God so that's why you shouldn't do that, but if it hadn't it would have been ok?\n\nPersonally, as long as it's consensual between adults, I don't care, I'm just wondering how given this is in the Bible, how some people can be so prudish. I mean this is really bad in some evangelical circles. \n\nI attended Oral Roberts University for a time and we could only go in the girls dorm on a few approved days in the year, and never at night,  and we were never allowed to be alone in a room with a girl. Not that it stopped some people.\n\nI had friends who attended Azusa Pacific University where this was not a problem. So clearly there are extremes.\n\nAny thoughts?",

The Holy Spirit may inspire you to be a good person, but no one is really good at the end, so therefore being good is not a pre-requisite for salvation.\n\nIn Islam, it also seems that submission to Allah is more fundamental than morality to the point some actions my be inmoral by society but not by Allah.\n\nIn Judaism, you find that often a Jew is always a Jew even if he is evil. Sure, this is more an ethic thing, but that is also post-moral.\n\nSo why is most criticism on religion focused on morality, if religion itself does not claim to be as moral anyway?",

It is oftentimes just easy to dismiss a whole group as vile crusaders or jihadists out of anger or ignorance. Here are few passages from bible I like as Muslim.\n\nMatthew 6 1-4\n\n“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.\n\n2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n\nMatthew 7 15\n\n15 “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.\n\nMatthew 18 12-14\n\n12 “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? 13 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. 14 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.\n\nMatthew 5 38-40\n\n38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’\\[a\\] 39 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.\n\nRoman 12 9-21\n\n9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.\n\nProverbs 25:21\n\n21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.\n\nProverbs 27\n\nDo not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.\n\n2 Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; an outsider, and not your own lips.\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:15\n\n15 Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.\n\nLuke 6:27\n\n27 “To you who hear I say, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. To the person who strikes you on one cheek, offer the other one as well, and from the person who takes your cloak, do not withhold even your tunic. Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.\"",

They're also described as not able to have a \"will\" of their own, but let's not forget to mention the rebellious Watchers who fell and laid with humans.\n\nDemons are another tier completely.

        "text": "I restarted reading (scholarly works) about Christianity to find out whether I could possibly go back into the worship of the God my father worshiped (inspired by the pagan/Pagan ideia of worshiping the Deity or Deities one's parents/ancestors worshiped, yes).\n\nI left Christianity for several reasons like it considering itself the only true doctrine, Christian people's duty to proselytize to every single human being on Earth, it being against homosexuality, it being against cult images, it spousing a way to live that's feasible only if one is an extremely altruistic and ascetic [Jewish(?)] beggar, etc..\n\nI was interested in the earliest forms of Christianity documented by extant sources. I was looking for their documented beliefs, devotional practices, what texts they considered canonical... I was interested in pre-Nicene material.\n\nBy diving into scholarly works on said matters foe just one or two days, wow! Being Christian is a lot of work!\n\nUnless a Christian person spouses a specific church's whole doctrine, there's a really large amount of decisions an individual Christian has to make in order to be an authentic Christian, like being an Unitarian,  Binitarian or Trinitarian; spousing a \"High Christology\" doctrine or \"Low Christology\" doctrine, etc..  And it's just some theological matters! There is Anthropology, Ecclesiology, Hamartiology, Eschatology, etc..\n\nI decided to concentrate on pre-Nicene material because it seems that way too much things people discussed already at the very first councils just isn't present at all even in canonical Biblical texts, like the concept of _ousia_. It means that a lot of things later Christian people literally warred over possibly have no basis in the scriptures they deem sacred.\n\nI really don't know how people can be Christian if they prefer to make their own decisions regarding the whole of the Christian faith instead of just subscribing to a church's established doctrine!",

        "text": "In traditional Islam, we are taught about the 7 layers of hell. \n\nEinar Thomassen writes that the seven levels of hell mentioned in the hadith \"came to be associated\" with the seven names used in the Quran to refer to hell, with a category of inmates assigned to each level.\n\n1. *Jahannam* is reserved for Muslims who had committed grave sins. Eventually to become empty after the last of the sinners even with a sand grain amount of faith is released.\n2. *al-Laza* (the blaze) for the Jews. \n3. *al-Hutama* (the consuming fire) for the Christians.\n4. *al-Sa'ir* for the Sabians (\n5. *al-Saqar* (the scorching fire) for the Zoroastrians\n6. *al-jahim* (the hot place) for the idolaters, polytheists, Hindus, Satanists, sun god, moon god, fire worshipers, pagans, (Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) parents T\\_T ), etc.\n7. *al-Hawiya* (the abyss) for the hypocrites, those who outwardly appear Muslim but are not so. Liers and deceivers. \n\nAlthough, elsewhere it is said by an Islamic scholar\n\n&gt;Dhahak ibn Muzahim : The second is for Christians, the third is for Jews,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;— [Tafsir al-Baghawy](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/baghawy/sura15-aya44.html#baghawy) also see [Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim ](https://shamela.ws/book/8658/2255)and [Tafsir al-Tabary](https://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/tabary/sura15-aya44.html#tabary)\n\nRight now I can't find where to place atheists/agnostics but I am sure some Islamic scholars will find a place for them here. I have read about it somewhere actually but can't find it now. Too little is talked about atheists/agnostics given little of them existed back then.\n\nThe orthodox creed is that the current Jews and Christians are disbelievers and will be in Hell in the hereafter. Accepting Judaism and Christianity to be the same as Islam or acknowledging the followers of these religions to be 'believers' - is considered heretical.\n\n&gt;وأن من لم يكفر من دان بغير الإسلام كالنصارى، أو شك في تكفيرهم، أو صحح مذهبهم، فهو كافر  \nWhoever does not acknowledge the Kufr of religions other then Islam, such as the Christians, or doubts their disbelief or considers their religion to be correct - then he himself is a Kafir  \n—  ( Sunni Shafi'ite jurist and hadith scholar ) [Rawdat al-Talibeen](https://shamela.ws/book/499/3999)\\- Imam Nawawi\n\n \n\n&gt;Indeed, they who disbelieved among the **People of the Scripture** and the polytheists will be in **the fire of Hell**, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;— [Quran 98:6](https://quran.com/98/6?translations=20)\n\n \n\n&gt;A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell**.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--- [abudawud:4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)\n\n  \n\n&gt;The Apostle of Allah (ﷺ) visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--- [muslim:976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:976b)\n\nI really hope our orphan prophet gets to see his parents someday. I really do. He loved his parents. Are all wishes granted in heaven or do you have amnesia? Makes you forget matters that were once important to you? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all. **It has seven gates**; for every gate is of them a portion designated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;— [Quran 15:43-44](https://quran.com/15/43-44?translations=20)\n\n \n\n&gt;Whoever amongst the community of **Jews or Christians** hears about me, but does not affirm his belief in that with which I have been sent and dies in this state, **he shall be but one of the denizens of Hell-Fire**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;— [Sahih Muslim 153](https://sunnah.com/muslim:153)\n\nAllah's wrath seems to have a mind of its own.\n\nAnyways there's still this.\n\n&gt;When Allah decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: **My mercy prevails over my wrath**. It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://sunnah.com/qudsi40:1](https://sunnah.com/qudsi40:1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Say, ˹O Prophet, that Allah says,˺ “O My servants who have exceeded the limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for **Allah certainly forgives all sins.** He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--[Quran 39:53](https://quran.com/39?startingVerse=53)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-- [Quran 2:62](https://quran.com/en/al-baqarah/62)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--[Quran 5:69](https://quran.com/al-maidah/69)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Allah has divided mercy into one hundred parts; and He retained with Him ninety-nine parts, and sent down to earth one part. Through this one part creatures deal with one another with compassion, so much so that an animal lifts its hoof over its young lest it should hurt it\".  \n\\--[riyadussalihin:420](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:420)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Umar ibn al-Khattab reported: Some **prisoners of war** were brought to the Prophet, peace, and blessings be upon him, and **a nursing woman** was among them. Whenever she found a child among the prisoners, she would take it to her chest and nurse it. The Prophet said to us, “**Do you think this woman would throw her child into the fire?**” We said, “No, not if she was **able to stop it**.” The Prophet said, “**Allah is more merciful to His servants than this mother is to her child**.” --[bukhari:5999](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5999)\n\nLesser known, not a reliable source of a hadith from  Kanz al-Ummal  \n\n&gt;The hadith #39505 in *Kanz al-Ummal* is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There will come a day that Jahannam will be dried crops, reddened completely empty.\n\nSo I don't know. Is it confusing, contradictory, or maybe misunderstood?\n\nMay Allah's mercy prevail over Allah's wrath.",

Why the hell is a Jew's answer given more weight? I don't give a shit what their rulings are. The question wasn't for Judaism - it was for Islam.\n\nBruh, it's obvious this subreddit is infested with disingenuous people. I don't go onto a question posed for pagans and answer on their behalf; instead, I would look for an answer that a pagan gave, and then I would engage with them to understand their perspective without dismissing it as apologetic or that they believe in some fairy tales. They already know based on me being a Muslim what I think about beliefs, so I don't need to rub it in their faces. Why does everyone do this with Muslims? What the hell man?\n\nI make one comment to explain how it doesn't matter if there's a scientific, historical, or any other reason behind the forbiddance of pork, and suddenly, I'm told that God isn't real and that I'm somehow a fucking Nazi.

        "text": "This is a continuation of a loose series of videos that I am doing looking at religion in general and Christianity in particular. I became Christian less than a year ago after spending my entire adult life as an ardent agnostic atheist, having even spent more than a handful of. years as an atheist activist. I'm now making videos trying to explore Christianity and religion in a way that will hopefully be useful to non-believers. I'm doing this not for the sake of winning over converts, but to promote improved understanding of what religion entails, and showing that there are key psychological and social functions that religious wisdom and community serve that are extremely hard to find outside of religion.\n\nMy goals: 1) NOT to get atheists to convert, but to get them to see Christianity as being far less unfounded than it can very easily seem; it's hard to give something a try if you have zero respect for it; 2) to show non-believers what they are missing in terms of the benefits of having an enduring, inter supportive, wisdom and virtue oriented community; and 3) to encourage nonbelievers to give religious community a try \\*even if they go as atheists and never change their minds\\*. Indeed, this is what I started off doing. \n\nAs a former cognitive science and psychology grad student, I'm going to be putting up a follow up video within the next week exploring the cognitive science behind what seems to make enduring, inter supportive, wisdom and virtue oriented community much easier to start on a religious foundation vs a secular philosophical foundation. \n\nTalking about religion in terms of historical truth vs pragmatic utility: [https://youtu.be/FWevUYVwjbQ](https://youtu.be/FWevUYVwjbQ)",

        "text": "I've seen lots of people define atheism as a \"lack of belief in God/gods\". That never made sense to me. How can you lack a belief in something when you know about that concept? If you never heard about the concept of God, you have no idea there is a concept of that, or rather you do not have an understanding of it, then sure, you lack a belief in God because you don't know it, or don't understand it. But, if you know that there's a concept of God, and you understand it (Which is the case with the vast majority of atheists), and you conclude that such concept does not have place in the real world (In other words, that it doesn't exist), then you don't lack a belief, you HAVE  a belief, which is a belief that God doesn't exist. When I was an atheist in my teenage years, I never lacked any belief in God. I knew about the concept of God, and understood it, and decided it didn't exist. I did not lack a belief in God, I believed God doesn't exist. \n\nI definitively do not understand why atheism is sometimes defined as a \"lack of belief in God\". That doesn't make sense in the context. The only way you can lack a belief in something is if you don't know about the concept. Someone explain me how you can lack a belief in God if you know what a God is supposed to be?",

For example Abortion, Gambling, and Pornography would be completely banned, and alcohol consumption would be moderated by alcohol laws similar to the ones of Nordic countries.\n\nTV programs would be censored against un-Christian material, and the internet would also be similarly restricted. Streaming services like Netflix would be blocked, instead there would be alternatives, for example something like a State owned version of Pure Flix.\n\nOn Sundays, the country would pretty much shut down as work and commerce outside of absolutely necessary services would be prohibited.\n\nIf the denomination of the country would be Catholic or Orthodox, there would be additional restrictions. For example, no Mammal and Bird meat would be sold during Lent and Advent, and divorce would also be illegal.",
