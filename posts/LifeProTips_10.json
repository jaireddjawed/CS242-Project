I live with my family, and there‚Äôs been occasions where I couldn‚Äôt smell smoke or CO2 and my parents or sister had to immediately address the issue. Or there was this one time I got food poisoning because I couldn‚Äôt smell that the food was bad. This worries me about moving out to a place of my own, where I will have no one to warn me about such events. Are there any devices I can use that can improve my life‚Äôs safety once I move out?

Or until they can get membership in a nearby gym. Wouldn't it be better to just immediately eat less, regardless of whatever you're eating?\n\nPoint is, people are prone to postpone their plans because they could be more well prepared. But doing SOMETHING is better than doing NOTHING, especially if you're going to be doing nothing for years.\n\nThis obviously does not apply to people with depression. But it seems to be a coping mechanism even neurotypical people will use. I'm only posting this because I've had great success incentiving people to execute their plans with whatever means they have at hand.",

Last night, around 3am, he went downstairs to let our dog out before he came to bed. The entire downstairs smelled like natural gas. He checked the stove, and sure enough, a knob was turned on enough to release gas. Paw prints were left at the scene of the crime. He turned it off, removed the knobs, opened the windows, then came to check on me. Luckily, the smell had not travelled upstairs and the bedroom door was closed. But our dog stays downstairs. He would have surely suffocated had we all been asleep. And who knows what would have happened to us. I'm 8 months pregnant, too. \n\nI looked online, and sure enough, there are childproof knob covers you can buy. I live in the US and am unsure how stove/oven knobs look in other countries. But if they are easy to turn on and off, I highly recommend finding a way to cover/remove them before your cat decides to pull a triple homicide.",

Take a 5 year deferred adjudication (which means a 5 year probation but the kind of probation where you are able to seal your record from the public by filing for non-disclosure). The problem is I have to wait 5 years after my probation is completed to file for having my record sealed.\n\nMost people are advising that I take the probation, so that I don't have a felony conviction on my record forever. But I am not excited about being on probation for 5 years with strict conditions, and which would also turn up a felony charge (without a conviction) on a background check, unless it does make a difference in terms of my chances of being hired for an engineering job.\n\nSo my question is, would most engineering hiring managers view a deferred adjudication/probation/felony charge without conviction more favorably than a felony conviction?
