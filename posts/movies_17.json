        "text": "I first want to say that I liked this movie.  This was your basic sci-fi, action-adventure movie starring Adam Driver.  The plot of the movie was typical: stranded astronaut on an uncharted planet who has one chance to escape in a pod and in order to get to the pod have to travel miles across unknown terrain with potential dangers.  To add to the problem of getting to the pod, he feels compelled to escort a young girl with him whom is the sole survivor of all of the passengers.  Throughout the movie, it is revealed that he feels compelled to save this young girl because he himself has a daughter who is waiting for him at home.  While I liked this movie, I would have rather the movie focused on the background story more than the actual journey of the characters trying to save themselves.  Since they are stranded on the planet Earth, yes, our Earth, I would have liked to have more background information on this human society that lives on a different planet.  A focus on Adam Drivers character, who is the pilot of this space ship, would have been more interesting.  I would loved to have known: where these people are coming from, where they are going, how did Driver’s character get picked for this job, his background?  If these questions were more focused on, I think this could have turned out better than just another average sci-fi movie.  At the end of it, I felt like this move basically took the concept of ancient aliens and presented it in a more palatable form.",

        "text": "I say this because I didn't go to either this weekend looking for something that needed to be all artsy, or technical, or well done in certain ways. I just wanted to go see a fun, scary, intense thriller that I could turn my mind off with for a little while. Not saying the new Scream was bad, but I didn't find it to be a fun movie to watch. And that's what was missing. The deaths oftentimes seemed more sad and disturbing then fun and scary. It's why I loved scream 4, it managed to be scary but also have a ton of fun with it. \n\n65 on the other hand was a total blast. The dino sequences were awesome and at times quite scary (the whole dark cave sequence with the thing in the characters mouth. If you know you know). I just found it to be a better balance of fun and scary, for my taste. If I had to say which one i recommend seeing in theatres it's 65. It has that big blockbuster feel that makes it worth seeing on a big screen. Scream on the other hand I'd say wait for streaming",

I’m surprised it was so critically loved as I found the humor to be much more tedious and immature than any Marvel movie or TV series, including the hated ones like Quantumania. Also found the runtime unnecessary. An hour and a half into the movie I found myself bored of the visuals and tired of these characters.\n\nTo be clear, I didn’t find this movie bad. I actually wouldn’t mind it winning best picture, but I don’t understand it being referred to as a masterpiece.",

So I know I’m late to the party but I have to talk about this movie. \n\nWhat I love so much about this film is not just the graphic and realistic violence that is portrayed in it, but truth be told the acting was a big time seller. The way each of the characters interact with each other on their quest to find Samantha just comes off as so natural and added to the realism of the already fairly raw and gritty movie. And my boy Patrick Wilson going on a kill streak while he’s basically only able to use one leg. The whole time it seems fairly obvious he’s going to bite the bullet, but his determination to get his wife back drives him to become the hero. \n\nThe other character I love and honestly empathize with is Chicory, when he’s talking about reading books in the tub while everyone else is trying to sleep just reminded me of being a little kid camping and having the same random and innocent conversations at ungodly hours to the annoyance of my parents. \n\nLastly yes, the special effects for the gore is extremely realistic and brutal and the troglodytes are intimidating and terrifying. \n\nOverall great movie, awesome acting, great pace, awesome practical effects, amazing directing. S. Craig Zahler needs to not only make more movies but more westerns.",

        "text": "Imagine being back in gym class and being picked last. Then you find yourself praying that the ball doesn't come your way, because you know you're going to somehow screw it up.\n\nThat's how I felt watching Moneyball. \n\nWhen we first meet Brad Pitt's character, his team is in the middle of another humiliating loss. The stress has gotten him to the point where he isolates himself, sitting in an empty stadium, intermittently listening to the game on a radio.\n\nHe's been through this cycle many times before and it hurts every time. He's dreading the next day, when sports analysts once again talk about him like he's a joke. He's ashamed and stressed out.\n\nHis status in the baseball world bothers the shit out of him and he feels like he's letting everyone down. He longs to be popular and respected - something he once had and lost.\n\nWhen Johan Hill enters the picture, he's a different kind of 'loser'. \n\nJonah's character comes off as someone who's spent his school years being bullied. He's intimidated by Brad Pitt's character. He doesn't long for status because can't even imagine *having* status. Instead, he wants the opportunity to provide his unique value.\n\nYou see the same theme with Hoffman's character, except he's gone numb to the pain. He takes his lickings like it's just another day. But he's also terrified of getting it worse than usual - hence his reluctance to play the way Pitt is telling him to. \n\nBut where Hoffman's character is resigned, Hill and Pitt's characters believe in their greatness. They feel like they *should* be making an impact. \n\nTo me, all three of these men are reflections of how it is to be low status in high school. \n\nSome people keep to themselves and focus solely on what they're good at (Hill).\n\nOthers keep showing up and trying to be somebody, even when they regularly get laughed out of the room (Pitt).\n\nAnd some just give up and accept their place (Hoffman).",

The beloved actor makes the jump to the director’s chair, with the help of original director and producer Ryan Coogler of course. Having worked together since 2013’s [***Fruitvale Station***](https://www.popmatters.com/178238-fruitvale-station-2495694571.html), this transition makes sense and is practically seamless. *Creed III* carries the distinct griminess and versatility that Coogler established in the first film with more than enough of Jordan’s own unique flavor. It stands high as one of the most distinguished sequels from the Rocky franchise, which is really saying something given the absence of Rocky Balboa himself. Michael B. Jordan fully commits to creating a cinematic experience that is both visceral and more imaginative than what you would expect from a boxing flick. If you thought this iconic series had already peaked, guess again.",

The story will rocket to the front page of /r/movies and people (depending on how they feel about the Oscars) will either speculate or gloat about those low viewership numbers. It's been happening like clockwork for about a decade now.  \n\n* “Oh, it’s because the Academy isn’t diverse enough and doesn’t reflect viewership demographics!”\n\n* “No, it’s because they went woke and nobody wants to watch that!”\n\n* “No, it’s because they only nominate boring movies nobody has ever heard of, instead of superhero movies!”\n\n* “No, it’s because they try to ‘reinvent’ themselves every few years by nominating blockbusters that have no business getting Oscar nominations!”\n\n* “No, it’s because they pad the ceremony with songs and skits and other BS that makes it run far longer than it should!” \n \nOK, so maybe *some* people consciously tuned out this year for the above reasons. But you know what else has been happening for the last decade? Cord cutting. [Across all demographics, Americans have been ditching cable in favor of streaming at a dramatic rate.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/17/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015/) And that data is already two years old. If you look at the trendlines you can get an idea of how unpopular cable TV is these days (especially among younger demographics). Once again, [the Oscars are broadcast on ABC, along with a few live TV apps](https://www.oscars.org/how-to-watch/) (such as YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV–which are far less common than non-live streaming services, like Netflix or regular Hulu). So if more and more people cut the cord every year, and if the Oscars refuse to air on popular streaming services, fewer and fewer people are going to watch them every year. Simple as. \n\nSo please, tomorrow when you're in that comment thread, and you’re prepared to launch into some rant about capeshit or woke voters, take a moment and think. Think about the millions of people who have canceled their cable subscriptions over the years and are getting along OK without the Oscars. And if *you* didn’t watch the Oscars, ask yourself: Did you do so because you were making a statement about politics or the film industry? Or did you do so because you don’t have live TV and you couldn’t stream it?  \n\n(And in fifteen months when the viewership numbers for the 2024 Olympics start to come in, remember this post.)",

        "text": "I think Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors working today but his writing unfortunately is simply not on that level. He is not a poor writer by any means but he has a tendency to favour concepts and experience over genuine character development and well constructed narratives which can often get very annoying.\n\nThe worst example of this tendency is Tenet which admittedly had some great ideas and concepts but its straight up poorly written imo none of the characters are intrestring or intriguing, its confusing just for the sake of it and nothing about the writing in that film in memorable. \n\nIts no surprise that some of his best works are either collaborative writing efforts with his brother Jonathan (The prestige, The dark Knight) or films with minimalistic dialogue like Dunkirk. I think that if Nolan is paired with the right screenwriter he can really make something special something which will be remembered for ages.\n\nWhat are some other directors with the same problem ?",

We all know Luther as this big, bad-assed dude who, although he's always fighting for justice, is not afraid to ignore the rules and even hurt people if the need arises. It occurs to me that in that sense he has a certain Batman-like quality, and I thought that here, in a movie format, they would really take the restraints off and let Luther go full tilt, showing us his frightening anger and rage towards criminals.\n\nInstead, while the plot was somewhat interesting, we didn't really get the Luther we deserved, in my opinion, and he was not even the lead character in the story. My suggestion: make another Luther movie, but this time, no pussyfooting. ;-)",
