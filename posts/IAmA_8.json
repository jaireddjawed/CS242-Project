        "text": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/yhcs4yo9znba1.jpg\n\nI'm Rick Linklater here to talk about my new film \"Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood\" out on Netflix. For a little background, eighteen years ago, I was pulling out memories of 2nd grade to help me construct the narrative of Boyhood's second year. Even though that movie is a celebration of the non-extraordinary, it became clear to me I had lived through and close to something truly extraordinary - the grandest and most enduring engineering feat in human history. I think it took decades for us to fully process that the Apollo program and walking on the moon was the apex because we'd all believed it was just a great beginning.  My \"who but me?\" thinking kicked in when I realized I was probably the only filmmaker that remembered how exciting it was to be a kid at that moment and was geographically that close to NASA. When I remembered an actual kid fantasy I had at the time, I stumbled upon my way to tell the story from both the astronaut perspective and from the bottom-up, public, TV-consumer perspective.

I never considered myself a potential writer, but back in 2013 a person who meant the world to me asked me to publish the poems written to cheer her up when she was feeling down. The work still exists, its English version - published a few years later - is titled [\"Poems to Ana\"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WH48QRM/), and it's usually free to read as an ebook.\n\n\nA few years later I found myself, while back living in Portugal, in an hospital room for a few weeks. After some back and forth on what was really going on, I was sent back home with what felt like a stunning piece of information - I had an auto-immune disease, Schleroderma. This information could have taken me in many different directions, but it led me to try to research even further topics I'm passionate about, such as Philosophy, Comparative Mythology and Forgotten Books. Then, I decided to write about some of those subjects and publish the results at low prices (i.e. usually never above $20), to ensure everyone could access those works. To give you just some random examples:\n\n* \"Themes of the Trojan Cycle\" was my Master Thesis, where I tried to complete the story of the Trojan War beyond the Homeric Epics, by taking advantage of intertextualities established between over 1000 years of western literature;\n* The \"Portugal with a Native\" series was created to briefly present what people can see in some specific local cities;\n* \"Famous Legends from Portugal\" briefly retells, in English, Portugal's most famous myths and legends, some of them never presented in that language before;\n* [\"The War of Cats and Dogs\"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRWK35SJ), my most recent work, is the English translation of an unusual XVIII century, almost forgotten, epic poem from Portugal regarding a war between the two species.\n* I'm currently working on a book where all royalties will be donated to support Ukraine.\n* And you can see my other works [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B01CFCYHE0/allbooks) if you want.\n\nSo... AMA!\n\n\n**My Proof:** I don't really use Social Media or share photos of myself online, but I can show you some of my book proofs (those versions are only accessible to authors), a credential from an old conference, plus results from a blood test that show that I have an auto-immune disease.

But today there are 65 people on the team (and [hiring](https://going.com/careers)) and it is immensely unfair and embarrassing and guilt-inducing every time a member writes in “thanks Scott!” for a cheap flight that 64 of my teammates helped them get.\n\nSo we decided to switch to a new look and name that’s about all of us, not just one person.\n\nOur mission to help people travel more and stop overpaying for flights is still the same. And the best part of my workday is hearing those real-life cheap flights success stories, especially from Redditors including: (all fares below are roundtrip, not Spirit)\n\n* [u/Thedishwasher3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/ynkisa/comment/iv9xvvw/) Tokyo for $490 nonstop\n* [u/Actuarial\\_type](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zv9q3x/comment/j1onzvf/) Amsterdam for $410\n* [u/Travelmore\\_magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/ynwu4c/comment/ivci06j/) Paris for $350\n* [u/Worldly\\_Economist686](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/103txzm/comment/j35nh69/) Greece for $480\n\n(If we’ve helped you get a cheap flight, let me know! I want to celebrate you.)\n\nI know rebrands can be polarizing—I don’t begrudge anyone who wishes it stayed SCF. I genuinely want to hear your thoughts about Going, the logo, the new look. Even negative feedback is welcome; it shows you care. The team has been working *extremely* hard for months, and we’re so excited to finally share with y’all.\n\n(One final note I’d be remiss not to mention: If anyone had license to be upset about the name change it’s me, Scott, and I’m ecstatic about it.)\n\n**Cheap Flights Stuff**\n\nYou may not care at all about the rebrand and just here to talk cheap flights and I hear you! It’s my favorite topic too.

DID YOU KNOW THAT over the period 2019-2022, the data from the dominant databases used in R&amp;amp;D statistics indicates a growth rate of ~30% per year of the number of papers on sustainability in OE?  OE is experiencing a paradigm shift to technologies and practices that assign value to the replacement of fossil resources with renewable ones, waste and energy minimization, and avoid the use of substances that pose serious risks to the environment and the human health. It comes because of the ever-stricter regulatory requirements worldwide and the community’s evolving attitude towards the environment. \n\"Sustainable Strategies in Organic Electronics\" dives into sustainability-driven OE, discussing the latest development in the field of:  green materials and synthesis; low energy, low material device fabrication techniques; sustainable end-of-life options; OE technologies scale-\nup from lab to industrial scale. \nI'll be here from 12-2 pm (CET time) on Jan 12 asnswering any questions about sustainability integration into mainstream OE.

In 2021, I founded [Disrupt PR](http://disruptpr.com/), a full service global public relations agency based in Austin, Texas (you can find us on Instagram @disrupt.pr). Since launching the company, we’ve worked with real estate tycoons, a fin-tech company revolutionizing prop-trading, a non-\nprofit helping orphans in Ukraine, and a guru in the ancient art of QiGong. We've gotten our client’s placed in the world’s top media outlets: The Today Show, New York Times, MSNBC, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Wired, and many more. In 2022, Disrupt PR has reached more than 3.8 billion people through 273 media placements. \n\nPrior to starting Disrupt PR, I was an award winning National broadcast journalist who reported the news 1000's of times, working on air at NBC, FOX and NPR. I studied at USC Annenberg School of Journalism then achieved a master’s degree in journalism from Columbia University. \n\nI’d love to talk more about how public relations works, getting earned media for a client and how to stand out in a noisy industry. \n\nAMA!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/y4C5NHJ)!",
