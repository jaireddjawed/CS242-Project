        "text": "So I recently came across some articles and papers regarding Integrated Information Theory (\"IIT\"), first as a sort of modern \"scientific\" version of panpsychism. IIT stipulates that a systems consciousness is determined by its causal properties and therefore an intrinsic, fundamental property of interconnected systems. The [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory), this [article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-consciousness-universal/), this [blog post](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/can-integrated-information-theory-explain-consciousness/), and this [website](http://integratedinformationtheory.org/) contain the information of the theory that I have currently established, along with this [paper](http://www.architalbiol.org/aib/article/viewFile/15056/23165867). \n\nAs a layperson this theory seems not crazy enough to dismiss outhand, yet not convincing enough to be considered a respectable hypothesis. Then I came across this [article](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/christof-koch-panpsychism-consciousness/) where Christoph Koch espoused similar ideas, and he seems to be a respected expert in the cognitive science field. So yeah, in summary, Integrated Information Theory - is it pseudo-scientific nonsense or something to consider reputable?",

A rush of predatory instinct compels them to relentlessly chase and hunt an inedible manufactured item. Yet a dog’s ancestral brain releases cascading waves of dopamine and serotonin, as if that ball was some sort of bird or rabbit. From this observation, we know the brain hardwires basic instincts through positive reinforcement. It’s the same way a spider learns to spin a web, or an adult salmon learns to migrate at the right time. A lot of animal behavior is hardware, not software a posteriori.\n\nHardware can also negatively reinforce. My dog loves to bark and attack shovels. My assumption is the shovel looked snake-like and its ancestral brain automatically sent her to react with fear and aversion. (She has never gotten hurt by a shovel, and I doubt her hostility is a reflection of something external).\n\nOf course dogs also have software (i.e. environment shapes the animal). You can zap electricity when a dog catches a ball or feed a dog a treat when it doesn’t bark at a shovel. Software augments parts of our natural hardware.\n\n**This I found odd.**\n\nEach instinct we have is an specific arrangement of 1’s and 0’s, or AGCT’s to be exact. It is embedded in our DNA code.\n\nWhen instinct augmented itself into newly conditioned behavior, what exactly happened to that seemingly immutable arrangement within our original hardware? Did some number’s flip? Did the code change or did we add more code?\n\nIsn’t that CODE the product of years and years of step-based evolution? How did we alter it simply with psychological reinforcement?",

Along with the moon receiving constant sunlight from a relatively short distance from the sun, means that the moon has a certain set of conditions which make it perfect to sustain life within it's warm oceans and it's hydrothermal activity.\n\nObviously, nobody can know for sure, but what is the likelihood that life can exist on the moon? Are there any planned missions by a space agency to go land on the moon and investigate what's down there? Is that even a possibility, or is the ice sheet above the water too thick to be able to tunnel through?\n\n*If* there does happen to be some form of single cellular, multi-cellular, or even complex life, similar to planktons or whatever, what would the implications of this be in terms of our understanding of the universe? If we find life in our *own solar system* outside of earth, would that pretty much all but guarantee that not only does the universe have life outside of our solar system, but statistically speaking, that the universe is absolutely *abundant* with life?",

If so, is it because of what they're made of or the size?\n\nSorry for my English, I hope the questions are clear.",

Now I think I pretty much understand everything about it at the highest level possible apart from experiencing it, which will likely never happen, to my disappointment.\n\nI haven't stopped asking myself hypothetical questions, but I came across this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF4ju6j6aLE) by a physicist Brian Greene from way back when, and he was talking about String Theory (which I also think is wicked cool). At one point, he was talking about a possibility of us testing the existence of a fourth dimension, and this got me extremely excited. TL;DW: By smashing two nano particles in the Large Hadron collider at light speeds, we can measure the energy level of those particles before and after collision. If amount of energy after collision turns out to be smaller than before collision, this would be significant proof of a possible existance of a fourth dimension - the energy would be transferred a certain distance along the 4th axis into a parallel 3d space.\n\nNow, back to the question from the title. We know that electrons jump up from one energy level to another when gained enough energy. Are electrons' orbits possibly 2D plains, and electrons themselves travel distance along the third dimension after gaining enough energy? I am completely ready for a disappointing answer, but I'd like to know if anyone knows anything more about this? I am just fascinated by this topic and would love to know even more. Knowing that there's possibly more than what we can see literally right next to us (in a possible 4th direction) is so fascinating to me.",

I'm sure the chemistry community can be blamed for the lack of interest in publicizing it's work to a broader audience, but is there something else that makes chemistry less popular that the other disciplines?",

When you fire a bullet out of a gun, you cannot see it at all due to the speed it is traveling at. \nHypothetically, if you could stand up in the sky and watch Concorde fly past you at its maximum velocity, would you be able to see it as it went by?\n\nNote: I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to ask this question, please redirect me if needs be.

He wasn’t completely denouncing it by any means, but suggesting it is being overused and a potentially slippery slope when presented as actual science (which I know is a tricky claim and I think he was referring to constructing empirical study). I don’t even think he had a major problem with meta-analysis as such, but suggested it could be inconsistent and unreliable\n\nWhich leads me to my question(s): \n\nSince meta-analysis is posted ad nauseum everywhere on Reddit and in the news, can all of these published “statistical” reviews be considered equal to independent empirical studies?
