        "text": "This is my first time posting here but I have been a lurker for quiet some time on all of the \"talesfrom\" Subs. Although I just came across this one today. Back a few months ago, I was working in a call center in a department that took calls for customers with gift cards and some certain bank cards and prepaid debit cards. \n\nWell, one call I had was a prime example of why I just don't like people. She was using her gift card to purchase gas.... outside at the pump. Now although a lot of people aren't aware that paying at the pump will automatically add a 20% (if I remember correctly) padded hold onto any gift card swiped outside at the pump, regardless of if you are actually able to purchase gas or not. You swipe it, it's held. And it's usually like $70. Sucks, I know. A very interesting conversation ensues....\n\nMe: Me-of course\nBL: Bitchy Lady\n\nMe: Thank you for calling card services, my name is mrsmayo, how can I help you today? \n\nBL: Yes, my name is Bitchy McBitchy Bitch and I need you to take off the padded hold that YOU placed on my card. (Yeah, I myself did this.) Your company has told me before what would happen if I swiped my card at the pump, but I went ahead anyways. (seriously?) \n\nMe: [stunned silence... blank for a moment...] I'm sorry, I am not authorized to release padded holds off of your card. It's placed on there in order to protect the merchant. \n\nBL: YES you can and YES you WILL remove it. I am (40-ish) miles away from home and need to get gas! \n\nMe: I'm sorry ma'am, I am not authorized to remove holds. I apologize for the inconvenience blah blah blah. \n\nBL: LOOK! I am at a gas station (40-is) miles away from home with no way to get gas! My child is a diabetic and we do not have the medicine with us! I have to get home so they can take their medicine! It's against the LAW to refuse to help someone with a medical condition and refuse to help them in order for them to get their medicine! \n\nMe: I'm sorry about that ma'am, but there is nothing I can do to release the hold. \n\nBL: WHAT IS YOUR NAME AND EXTENSION?!?!?! I AM CALLING THE COPS RIGHT NOW AND ALSO MY LAWYER AND SUING YOU! You WILL be getting a call back from MY LAWYER!\n\nNow we don't have extensions but we are allowed to give out our phone ID numbers just to satisfy them. And we actually rarely ever keep the same desk, so it wouldn't matter anyways. So I give her the ID number and she hangs up. Now we really aren't authorized to remove padded holds, but in extremely necessary situations, we can go through this huge long process and bring in our supervisors and their managers and they sometimes can, but there was no way I was going to go through all this trouble to help a total witch. (Who might I add was rude to begin with.) We all have those calls that you know will be hell JUST because of their tones, right? \n\nGladly, I no longer work there, getting paid little to none, to but up with entitled, RUDE, people. Sorry if there are any errors in my posting. ",

        "text": "Hi again, you might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/3vgbik/the_mrs_b_saga/) \n\nI'm back again fresh from having contact with Mrs B. Here's what I gathered and put through on our internal logs. Enjoy!\n\n*****\n\nAbout 8 mins of peppy verbal barrage. Here's what I made out:- \n\nShe wants 1 Bottle of Port she would love to be able to get a full case of 12 but that's wishful thinking (**laughter**) it makes her remember when her father used to order from the [company]. [company] is doing great things for England. We're all very good Christians. The Port is £45 and we'll get the money soon she doesn't have much money but we will get it. £45 is reasonable and lets stick with that. It needs to last 20 years so £45 is a good price. \n\nShe wanted to tell me a true story of when she used to drink port with the reverend and it was he that was such a good friend because she's a royalist as we know. She has always been a royalist and port is good to toast the Queen. You must toast the queen as a Christian. (**something about king charles**). Jesus turned water into wine that's a true story. If you try and pour wine from communion back into the bottle that's a sin because it's blessed by God so you must not pour it away she knows that.\n\nOn holy saturday she went to see her relations and most people don't realise it's holy saturday but it is holy saturday that she gave up alcohol for lent and she doesn't want us to feel let down so this is why she thinks £45 is a good price for the port especially because in 20 years (**no idea, this bit was far too fast**) and God bless all of us. \n\nTold me it's been so nice talking to me, laughed loudly and happily said byeeeeeeee before hanging up.\n\n...\n\n\nI've no idea (again) if she wanted me to actually do anything.\n\nI'm sure she'll call back if she does.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/40p2pp/im_running_low_on_spoons/",
        "text": "There is a theory out there that involves spoons and the disabled. Essentially it states that disabled people are allotted a set amount of spoons for the day. Each activity takes spoons from you. Also, the disability could be mental or physical.  \n\nThe amount of spoons I have for the day depend on too many variables. Once I’m out of spoons for the day, I can decide if I want to take them from the next day, or just call it quits. More often than not, I borrow spoons from the next day and screw myself over for that next day as I will then have fewer spoons.  \n\nIn 2012 I broke my back. I’m still walking, just living with unending pain, stiffness, and lack of mobility. In 2014 I had surgery to help with the issues. With my poor luck, I fell on the ice in December of 2015 and messed it all up. I’m not far enough out from my surgery to be fully healed and this is a problem.  \n\nThis month I’ve been scooting around in a wheelchair because I can no longer trust my legs to remain under me while I walk. The center I work in is full of disabled people and I thought it wouldn’t be too difficult to get around here. I was wrong. So very wrong. The restrooms don’t have the soap within reach if you’re in a chair, and you have to lift your arms up to your face to reach into the sink to wash them. The doors to the building, inside and out, are not easy. I have to badge the door to get it to unlock, but there is no button so the door will stay open. I spent 10 minutes attempting this before someone found me. The door to my secured department is the same; swipe badge, open door, door shuts behind you. I sit at the door knocking and waiting for someone to help me. (You’re not allowed to hold the door open for anyone, the camera takes a photo when someone badges and you will get fired if you hold the door open for someone else.) People in the building think the handicapped stall in the restroom is a throne that you can rule the world from for hours on end, thus making those who truly need it wait. I’ll spend a good 2 hours of my 8.5 hour shift fighting with doors and people camped out in the restroom stall I need. I know I will face these issues every time I work and it’s making me feel defeated. The building just isn’t accessible for people in wheelchairs. I’ve already been told that nothing can be done about the doors for security reasons. I was told to just report the camper in the handicapped stalls to HR when I have the issue.  \n\nI just don’t know what to do. This job is perfect for me and I don’t want to leave just because functioning in the building is hard. I don’t get in trouble for the overage on breaks and lunch because that’s just something that cannot be changed. I don’t know how to address the problems with HR. They won’t do anything unless you have a reasonable way of fixing the problems presented at the time you make the complaint. (For reference, there is ONE door to the building that has the handicap button for the doors. It’s on the other side of a massive warehouse building from where I work. I use side or back entrances and never the front desk.)\n",

I work in a center for a wireless provider and a few months ago they made it a requirement to have a security passcode. She didn't know what it was so I had to talk with the acct holder. He couldn't remember it so we needed to reset but in order to reset it we have to send a pin to the phone. Since he didn't have the phone we couldn't compete that. She came back on the line and again said she is his social worker and has permission to talk to me from him. \"What's the problem we just had one question?\" I explained without verifying I can't give any information. She then told me \"You're terrible. You should find another job.\" I was so surprised at that. I told her that is so unprofessional if she is a social worker. She hung up and at this point I'm pretty sure she wasn't a social worker but how am I terrible at my job for doing exactly what I'm supposed to. And she made sure to tell me she was a social worker at least 4-5 times. I hate this new requirement because people have been getting so upset saying they refuse but this was so unnecessary. ",

        "text": "Hey there TFC, It's /u/hakkai999 again with another of my Stupid Player drama. I usually post things here just to vent out and get rid of my anxiety with dealing with idiots on our games. Last time we had the GPU Snob who had both an NVidia and AMD graphics card in one system. This time it's about \"massive disconnections\" as the player would term it. Here's how it went with my being $Mod and the player being $Cunt.\n\n&gt;$Cunt: I've been experiencing numerous disconnections and lost items. Could you verify my disconnections on my account? Its clearly your servers being shit.\n\nMind you that even though our servers are indeed massively stressed due to a recent event in our game we don't have \"massive issues\" at the moment so I tried to investigate.\n\n&gt;$Mod: Alright I'll be happy to help. Could you provide me a trace route please?\n\n&gt;$Cunt: Have you tried to verify my issue? *Proceeds to link me of the pages to our **maintenance posts** that stated we dealt with server stability*\n\n&gt;$Cunt: See there? You guys did maintenance for server stability so clearly your servers were unstable and caused me to disconnect.\n\n\nMind you that all games do server stability maintenances from time to time. This was just a special case as we released a new server that is massively popular at the moment and was experiencing problems due to it's popularity.\n\n&gt;$Mod: I am quite aware we did maintenances during those times but these were for the new server. Your character seems to be in *insert server here*. It's the oldest and most stable one and I can assure you is the most stable.\n\n&gt;$Cunt: Well it still doesn't explain why I'm disconnecting.\n\n&gt;$Mod: Could you please provide me with the trace route so I can diagnose the issue for you?\n\n&gt;$Cunt: Here you go.\n\n\nI then proceeded to check his trace routes and unsurprisingly enough he has a timeout and very close to his network topology. From my guess, it times out on his router. \n\n&gt;$Mod: I have checked your trace route and I can clearly see a time out. Since this is the case, the most likely thing that has happened is that you have been experiencing network issues since last month and may need to get in touch with your ISP to solve this issue.\n&gt;$Cunt: My ISP informed me that it's fine. I've been playing other games without issues. I dont need troubleshooting, I want compensation for the disconnections.\n&gt;$Mod: I'm sorry that your ISP has lied to you but I assure you that your network is experiencing issues. Since you don't want my help, I'm gonna have to close this ticket.\n\nFrom my understanding, regardless of being able to play other services, depending on your network's QoS you will still experience issues especially if the backbone of that network is on the fritz. This easily explains why you are not able to get to, let's say, pornhub but can easily get to reddit.\n\n**TL;DR: Player wanted a refund because he disconnected a lot despite not being our fault.**\n\nP.S. Is any of you here an ISP rep? Do you flat out lie if you aren't able to fix the network issue?\n",

        "text": "Corporate made a change to the attendance policy company wide. Before we had what were called integral days where if you were late or didn't show up you would get attendance points. Even if you still had sick time available. These days would also count for double the normal points. So if you were more than 2 minute left and you had no sick time left you would get .25 of an attendance point. On an integral day you'd get half a point even with sick time still available. If you missed a full day with no sick time you'd get a full point. Integral days you'd get 2 points. The whole month of December is pretty much an integral month. Or so we thought. \n\nIn July Corporate updated the attendance policy. This was for the entire company. The other call centers were told of this. But not the sales center. We were still under the assumption that there were integral days still in effect since management never told us the new attendance policy or had us sign anything. To be fair this information is on the main corporate webpage so anyone could look it up if they wanted to go search for them. Unfortunately the sales center management decided that not to put that information on tun main website sales uses. \n\nThe only reason I found out about it was because a friend of mine who became q manager told me about it. So  I looked it up. And sure enough there it is. Now I'd send this out as a message to my department for people to look up themselves but I heard a rumor that a person in our call management department got fired for arguing with a manager because they were told not to send the email out about the updated policy change since they wanted to keep it under wraps. \n\nI just really. Really. Hate this job. ",

        "text": "I work for a telecommunications company that offers Live Receptionist services. Most of our customers that use these services are doctor's offices and real estate investors. We occasionally get some customers that do some sort of wacky thing to their script or maybe use our services for some other thing, but all of our customers are pretty normal. Before moving forward (so I don't sound insensitive or rude), when I say normal I mean things that  you would typically expect when you work at an answering center and you aren't informed of what kind of calls you'd be taking. Nobody goes to work at an answering services expecting to take calls for a sybian rental company. But guess what...suddenly we do!\n\nI haven't taken any calls for this company yet and I don't go back into work until Monday, but I'm definitely excited to take calls for this customer. It will be a nice change of pace from the current repertoire of callers we speak with.\n\nI'm also looking forward to taking calls for this customer because I took a look through the script and I feel more comfortable with it than I do with most other scripts. There's so much information that they provided to us about their processes that I feel we can really answer all of the big questions someone would ask prior to renting a sybian online.\n\nOur higher ups already sent out an email letting us know they intend on listening to every call that comes in from this customer because they want to ensure that the callers aren't giving us a hard time and that we are remaining professional. I think this may be because this is a script that is explicitly about something sexual (our first one at that) and we have no experience with what kind of callers will be calling in nor how the average employee might handle speaking to a stranger about a topic like sex.\n\nAnyways, I figured I'd share this event happening at my job and intend on updating this thread (or just making a new post) if some crazy story comes out of this. To stimulate discussion, what's the most out there thing you've had to speak with someone about on the job?",

Every call I change what I asked for.\n\nThis particular call the third and final bit I asked for was her phone number.\n\n&gt;AL: Ahahaha you see, now that's what I want to change. I've canceled my main phone and just have a mobile now because of those damn PPI and injury claim calls!\n&gt;ME: You're telling me! I had one just today! They're a nightmare!!\n&gt;AL: Aren't they just! I started having fun with them though and strung them along as long as humanly possible!\n&gt;ME: Really? How so?\n\n\n\n&gt;AL: I had one where they guy said I'd been in an accident. So I got really into it and started saying things like \"really? Are my arms and legs still there? Let me check\". The guy on the phone brought it so I got more and more elaborate. By the end of it, it was ludicrous. He finally sharply turned around to me and went *don't be so fucking ridiculous*      \n\nThat was it, I don't care if clients swear at me, to me, about anything. - doesn't phase me.\n\nThat was it though. I was in absolute hysterics, crying with laughter. When you deal with the high class with mansions worth 10 million plus and butlers, for someone to say that to me, I was in stitches brightened my day.\n\nNearly as good as the time I walked someone through using their iPad with our product to turn around and go \"Fucking apple.

Our cable company is one of the largest,  if not *the largest*, in the USA and is well known.\n\nI accepted a service \"upgrade\" to a higher level plan in order to get a promotional rate as suggested (sold?) by the CSR.  I also agreed to upgrade to the equipment the CSR pitched to me.  All in all because of the new technology, and the promotional rate I got by extending my contract, both the basic service and the equipment charges were to decrease by a fair amount (around $50/month decrease).  I also was told that I could do a self install on all the equipment (I have good technical skills) and that no installation call was needed and that there would be no installation charge.  I confirmed all of this three times very clearly during the call including during the CSR's recap of the changes at the end of the call.  The CSR even repeated her name for me to write down at the end of the call.\n\nI received an order confirmation the next day and to my shocking surprise:\n\n* The service was downgraded instead of being upgraded\n\n* The service cost was higher than agreed upon\n\n*  The cost for the equipment was slightly higher than my current cost instead of being lower (Diff of around $40/month).\n\n*  There was not only a steep installation charge added to the bill but there was also an installation service call scheduled for a day that I never would have agreed to as I was scheduled to be out of town that day.\n\n*  I later received a separate email confirmation of the shipment of the new equipment and the actual equipment shipped was different from both what we had discussed over the phone and was incorrect for the services specified in the service order confirmation.\n\nIn other words the CSR, despite confirming everything with me verbally after she had entered it, had pretty much made an error on every possible part of the order:  Service level, pricing, equipment, equipment pricing and installation.\n\nI will emphasise that I was very polite and cordial during the order.  I did not in any way say anything mean nor argumentative with the CSR.  I told her what I wanted, she explained what they could do, and I accepted her suggestions and thanked her for her help.\n\nI did call the day after receiving the order confirmation with all the errors and someone in a problem resolution area changed the order to match what I had asked for, and did so in a very polite manner and quickly and sent a revised confirmation that is now correct.  So at least there was no hassle at all getting this corrected other than the fact that I had to get it corrected and spend another half hour on the phone.\n\nBut I just don't understand what the motivation would have been here and what could have happened.  There is no way that, with every area of the order being off, that this happened by chance or that there was a complete misunderstanding between me and the initial CSR.  Can anyone shed some light on this.",

If the email attached is no longer serviceable then they need to contact us to change it. Our story begins as me being $REP and player being $CUNT.\n\n&gt;$CUNT: Hi my account is deactivated and I need it reactivated. Could you change my email address on the account?\n\n&gt;$REP: Could you give me some details of the account and including a picture of a valid government ID for verification?\n\n&gt;$CUNT: *Provides account details* hey before I provide you my ID why is this necessary?\n\n&gt;$REP: Great question. Basically its to verify if you really are the real owner of the account. If for example a close friend, parent, best friend, brother/sister, etc. knows your details they can easily pose as you and steal your account if we do not ask for a valid ID.\n\n&gt;$CUNT: Oh thats ok you dont really need to that since I didn't really spend any money on your game\n\nNow at this time I'm like \"WTF do you want us to get sued for not securing our customer's accounts?\" and at the same time I checked for the account in question and **he is using the email address attached to the account to contact us** which means all he needs to do is to either log into the website to send in the verification email or do a password reset so that he can login and do the process manually.\n\n&gt;$REP: Well sir its for all accounts regardless if you paid into the game or not. Since we care for your safety and of course for legal reasons we really need this verification to be done. \n\nAt this point the ticket automatically closes and I got a bad rating for no apparent reason.

        "text": "For context, I've been working for one of the big name call centres for about a year now, and the last few months have left me feeling miserable.\n\nThe list of things that have bothered me in my present workplace has grown quite numerous, and include:\n\n* Problems which our client have been springing upon us. Often, these problems make our jobs harder and increase the amount of customers that call in to untenable levels.\n\n* Low pay, partially down to decisions made by my team leader in a prior pay review. As of writing, I've found out that there are a number of colleagues earning somewhat more than I am, while I've been put on the lowest bracket of earnings - despite the fact that I often have very high stats, and despite me receiving a letter from HQ congratulating me on being a top performing employee. \n\n* Inconsistent working hours. Since I'm on a \"fully flexible\" contract and my job essentially amounts to full time shift work, my shifts vary immensely from very early starts to midday starts. Oh, and I'm often contracted to work weekends too. Of course, the inconsistency essentially means I often come into work tired, on very little sleepand often have to ingest copious amounts of caffeine just to stay awake.\n\n* Denial of further training or advancement through the company. While other colleagues - including people who started later than me - have been piggybacked through leadership and quality assurance training, and then eventually promoted, I've been denied further training, under the guise that I \"ask too many questions.\"\n\n* Preferential treatment/favouritism. There are a few employees who will often stay in email handling all day, and while some of them work hard, others will do fuck all and just chat and gossip, all with hardly any repurcussions. Meanwhile, if I'm spending too long to wrap up a call or decide to put myself in an aux code to write a VERY important follow-up email, I get managers telling me off and expecting me to hit the available button again, because they know I'll do as they say.\n\n* Angry, irate, and entitled customers.\n\n* Having an untenable workload (endless back-to-back calls each day) because reasons.\n\n* Feeling lethargic, out of energy, depressed and overall demoralized whenever I'm out of work.\n\n* Feeling like management has ignored my concerns of stress and favouritism.\n\nAnyway, I've wanted to hand in my notice and go out with a bang for a little while now, but it's mainly fear that's held me back. What if I end up unemployed in the long term? What if I don't get a favourable reference? What if an employer sees that I resigned, and thinks I'm lazy, uncommitted, or unsuitable to work with them? What if I can't find anything other than another call centre job?",

Just had a customer call in and speak to one of my representatives about returning a product because it didn't fit the vehicle he has. The way our site works, it's all sorted by vehicle. The guy had a Jeep Wrangler but the part number he ordered ONLY appears on the Jeep Patriot and the Jeep Compass section of the site so it was clearly a mistake made by the customer. Our rep set him up with a return number and gave him the return address- and then the fun begins. Unless there was a mistake made by our company, the customer is responsible for return shipping expenses. The customer basically demanded that we pay for the return shipping and send him a prepaid label and if we didn't, he was going to report us to the BBB and his Attorney General and all this other crap (the part is like $19.95 and shipped via Postal to him). Finally he asks to speak with a Supervisor (Yay me). \n\nI answer the phone and it goes like this-\n \nME: Thank you for holding, this is Born2BeBrave, how can I help  you? (I already know what his problem is, so I prepare for his mouthing and complaining). \n\nCustomer: Are you a manager or supervisor?\n\nMe: (Thinking why else would you have been transferred to me) Yes sir. How can I help you?\n\nCustomer: The part you (explicit) sent me doesnt work on my Jeep and the lady I talked to before you said I had to pay for return shipping, that's unacceptable and I demand a shipping label. \n\nMe: Sir I apologize that the product doesn't work on your Wrangler but our site makes it clear that this item you purchased only works for the Compass or the Patriot\n\nCustomer: I know what I drive and I know what I ordered. I didn't order a part for a Compass or a Patriot. \n\nMe: You did actually sir, and for this reason since it wasn't a mistake by *Company I work for* we are unable to provide a prepaid return label. You will need to send it back at your own expense. \n\nCustomer: Who is the owner of your company? I want to speak to them. \n\nMe: **eyes roll thinking 'NOT THIS AGAIN'** Sir I am afraid the owners of the company do not handle returns, and they wrote the policy that I abide by in this situation so I don't believe that they would feel differently about this so I am unable to let you speak with them. \n\nCustomer: Just give me the (explicit) return number. \n\nMe: **gives return number and address**\n\nCustomer: What's the name of your owner- I want to make sure that they know how lousy your customer service department is. \n\nMe: **My parents actually own the company I work for, but I dont care for the customer to know this** I am not giving you this information sir. You can have MY name again though. \n\nCustomer: It wont be that hard for me to find out who owns your company but yeah, what's YOUR name because im going to have you fired for this..... \n\nMe: *Grinning, I give him my first and last name and extension*\n\nThe customer starts rambling again and I have much more pressing issues so at this point he already had all the info he needed so I ended the call. I can't wait for him to connect the dots after he sees that I have the same last name as the owner. \n\nI dont know why people just expect free return shipping? Amazon actually doesn't even do free return shipping on non-mistake returns. They will send out a label but that charge comes out of the refund. Does anyone else have to deal with this?\n",

        "text": "I finally put in my two weeks' notice at a call center for a major retailer... and I thought that'd make the work day easier, but I'm having a hell of a time getting through these last shifts. This was a seasonal gig that allowed my SO and I to get settled in a new state. I work 10-12 hour shifts 3-5 times a week with 1 hour of driving each way. This is the worst job I've ever had and I leave work ridiculously pissed or sobbing every night. I've never been this affected by a job, ever, and can't stand that I can't separate my work life from my home life with this particular job. \n\nSince I started, I've had terrible anxiety, multiple nightmares, woke up crying once and told my SO, half-awake, that I was so sorry I couldn't place an order for him, etc. etc. I've been called all sorts of awful names, handled some of the most batshit craziest people I've ever experienced, and still managed good sales, but emotionally, I'm wrecked. I've worked customer service for almost ten years and I know not to take this crap personally, but nothing could've prepared me for the abuse I received on the phone this holiday season - the VOLUME of it especially. In a store, I'd get one or three bad eggs a day, but here it never seems to end. I take approximately 75-90 calls a day, depending on my hours, and that plus my commute and lack of sleep is clearly wearing out what I used to think was a pretty thick skin. I'm a fairly active person, and sitting in a chair for entire days, never seeing the sun (sometimes I leave at 5 and get home way after dark) is bumming me out. Hard. \n\nI'm done. I hate people. My co-workers are all alcoholic college students, so there's not a lot of in-work venting I can do. Reading through this sub has been nice, but I wanted to write in for advice or just to commiserate. Thanks for being the place to do that. Feels a little better to post this. \n\nYou all probably know the drill, but it never gets easier. Especially not now, when I've got a new job lined up. In a few weeks, I'll finally start as an assistant children's librarian with a 15 minute commute - it's the job I went to school for, and I love working with kids. Until then, though, I'm wondering if I'll be able to get through without packing up and walking out early. I need the money, sure, but I could survive without it, especially if it means keeping my emotional stability and not completely losing my mind. \n\nWhat do you guys do to stay sane? I'm having trouble even sounding relatively friendly on the phone at this point. For every decent call, there seems to be five ridiculous ones, and I'm trying to muster up at least some fucks to give but all I can think about is not coming in for my last few shifts. SOS, call center comrades. \n\nUpdate: I'm so overwhelmed by all of your thoughtful responses. Really, it made a huge difference - I called out yesterday and then re-read your posts to get motivated to come in today. Thank you, sincerely, for taking the time to provide some comfort and support. Happy new year to you all! ",

We are doing the replacement at absolutely no cost to the customer, no increase in monthly rate, no charge for a tech to come out, nothing. When we do the update we take the old piece of equipment with us this is important.\n\n\n\nME: How can I assist you today?\n\n(Angry old man): Your company stole my equipment and I want it back! \nI'm scanning the notes on his account and see that the update has been done on his system. \n\nME: I'm sorry you feel that way sir, but we actually replaced your equipment with superior technology and I won't be able to return your old equipment to you.\n\nAOM: Well I paid for it, and I want it back. You didn't tell me you were going to take it, you can just come and reinstall it.\n\nME: Well sir, if we reinstall it then your system will no longer function...\n\nAOM: Then just give it back to me, that piece of equipment is worth $2000 I paid for it and I want it back.\n\nME: Please hold for a moment while I research taht for you.\n\nAt this point I think I understand what he is after he wants to resell the equipment because he thinks it is worth a lot of money. (to clarify the part he is talking about is only worth $250, the invoice he is looking at is the total value of the equipment in his home at the time of installation.)\n\n\n\nI contacted my sup because I had never encountered a call like this before, and my supervisor was basically just like yeah we have had a few of those and we aren't returning the equipment we gave him something worth more. So I click back on with the angry old man.\n\n\n\nME: \"I'm sorry sir but I can't have that equipment returned to you, if we reinstalled it your system would no longer work, and besides they get rid of them after the new installation is completed.\n\nAOM: (screaming and cursing) \"Your company stole from me, I wan't my $2000.\n\n\n\nCue ten minutes of me arguing with the customer about how we provided him with basically a $500 free service by installing that new equipment and at one point asking him what he thinks replace means? Eventually I had to transfer him to our retention department, but I was literally repeating the same thing over and over again, and my volume kept increasing as his did. How I didn't get a coaching about that call I will never know.",

Every phone call was nerve-racking. There was always such contempt on the other end, especially when I asked for money. I never once felt confident or authoritative, like I had control over the call. Like I said, I sucked.\n\nAlthough I would occasionally interact with friendly people who let me down easily, most of my attempts were met with \"GO AWAY!\" and a *click*. One day, though, something so horrible happened that I actually needed to go cry in the women's bathroom.\n\n&gt;Me: Hello, may I speak to Mr. [last name]?\n\n&gt;Woman: What?\n\n&gt;Me: May I speak to Mr. [last name]?\n\n&gt;Woman: *WHAT*?\n\n&gt;Me: ... (confused)\n\n&gt;Woman: He... he... *died yesterday*. HE **DIED**. \n\n&gt;Me: Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am. \n\n&gt;Woman: He died. DIED. *How could you*? **HOW COULD YOU**?! (intense sobbing)\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know. He was on our list and... \n\n&gt;Woman: How could you? How could you do this to me? (more crying)\n\nAt this point, I think heard someone on the other end comforting her, telling her to calm down.\n\nI was in shock. I couldn't hang up because that would somehow be worse, I think. So, I just waited as she cried it out. She finally spoke:\n\n&gt;Woman: I'm sorry, I just... he just died.\n\n&gt;Me: That's okay, I understand. I'm sorry. \n\n&gt;Woman: Never call again. (*click*)\n\nI couldn't breathe for a few seconds. The person next to me heard the whole conversation on my end and noticed how pale my face was. He asked if I was all right. I nodded. That's when I excused myself for the restroom.\n\nRationally I know that I didn't do anything wrong and that I couldn't have known, and that she was dealing with some profound pain and that's why she blamed me, but I couldn't shake the horrible guilt I felt for quite a while. That experience confirmed that I was not cut out for this type of job. My hat's off to all of you brave souls in call centers.\n\n",

Cargo had the same problem: their shipments were getting lost in Dallas due to the \"tornadoes,\" I heard a fellow agent say.\n\nMy mother works right next to me and booked us a little bit of perspective. \n\nShe got a call from a lady to check in immediately. Upon asking how long she would be staying she was met with an answer from the woman who was shaken and nearly in tears. \"I don't know right now, my house just got blown away, we have nothing left.\"\n\nIt made me think about how we sometimes get callous about what is going on in the country or even the world. We see the weather or whatever as an obstacle in our job and forget about the real people its affecting beyond the ten minute phone call we have with them. I really hope that this woman and her family are all okay and they get some much needed help because it sounds like they are going to need it. I can't imagine having to tell someone so calmly that I have nothing left to my name.\n\nTL;DR: Customers on the phone are real people and sometimes we forget that. Got a reality check today.",

This site is basically a portal only for their long-time deposits (CD's).\n\nThese customers basically just have to login once to setup their account, then login a couple of years later to close the account or whatever they want to do.  some of them log in regularly to check on their money regularly. Sometimes too regularly.\n\nAbout a year ago, our service provider setup the login to enable two-factor authentication.  The customer could choose to not enable this feature, after using it once.  Some called to ask about the new feature, but there were no major issues. \n\nsomewhere down the line, the programmers noticed there was some sort of problem, where the two-factor authentication would be asked, regardless of whether the customer wanted it or not.  To fix it, they disabled the opt-out feature figuring it was better to err in the side of caution and that customers would appreciate more security, rather than less.  Our customer's reactions? OH HELL NO.\n\nWe've received more complaints about this than I've seen for anything else, and we've had some pretty bad screw-ups in the past.  Some customers went so far as to complaint to financial regulators, claiming since their experience was ruined.  Mind you, logging into the site now takes 10 seconds, instead of the usual 7.\n\nYou just can't win with customers.",

Granted the cancellation policy is a bit odd, but you have to send us a letter to cancel your services with us, and then there is a thirty day period where your account is still billable and we continue to provide you with our service.\nLiterally every day, I would say about sixty percent of my phone calls involve a customer who either only called to tell us they want to cancel, and didn't send the required letter, or did send the required letter and their contract wasn't over for another two years, or they sent the letter and got the final bill for their account. I will be me and the AC will be AC\nMe: How can I assist you today? AC: I called you six months ago to cancel my service and now you are sending me a bill for $300.00 I don't owe you this money and I refuse to pay you anything, my lawyer will be hearing about this.\nI look at their account and they haven't sent us a letter and there are no records of any phone calls about them wanting to cancel or speaking with our retention department, the department which actually spells out the cancellation procedures.\nMe: Well I'm sorry you feel that way but there is a procedure that has to be followed to cancel your account with our company, now if you like I can arrange a payment for you and get you to the proper department to get your account resolved. AC: No I refuse to pay you another dime, I'm calling my lawyer and the Better Business Bureau click\nIt just warms my heart that their lawyer is going to review their contract and tell them that they have to pay the money anyway because our cancellation policy is outlined in the contract if they bother to read it.",

Sometimes I can convince myself that it gets easier, but when it comes down to it I sense that this kind of work is just fundamentally unhealthy. Anyway, every so often I will notice what seem to be patterns in the calls. Everyone's problem belongs in the same category. Or, different, varied problems whose solutions are spoiled by the same, specific obstacle. Or, a string of customers who all share the same specific inclination. If it's all in my imagination then I guess I'm insane, but otherwise, I'm getting fake calls. I know there are companies whose business is to run these fake calls, I guess as part of an evaluation or training process or something. Really I'm just wanting to know if anyone else has this same perception, or if everyone else knows all about it and so don't feel the urge to bring it up, or if I'm just delusional. What do you think?",

He wasn't mean, he wasn't the caller of my dreams, just a regular guy following directions to get his cable working again. The troubleshooting was successful and I wrapped up the call...\n\nMe: Thank you for calling &lt;cable&gt;, my name is &lt;me&gt;, I'm glad I was able to **sleep** with you today.\n\nI think I turned 15 shades of red in about half a second. My caller started laughing, made a corny joke about the unexpected compliment and told me I was \"very welcome\". I laughed, stammered an apology, and died a little inside.\n\nIn my defense this was my first shift out of training and I finished at 2:30am. \n\n",

No big deal, we have people do that all the time. I tell her she can fill out a Credit Card Authorization form, which is a document that as her credit card information on it and says what charges she wants to use her card for (room and tax, restaurant charges, parking, or everything), and her signature on it. I told her she could either fax it to us or print it out and have her father bring it with him when she checks in, to which she responded \"I don't have a printer.\" She she decided she'd going to book a reservation online and pre-pay that way. I was thinking she was going to use Expedia or Hotels.com, something like that, but NO, she went through our corporate booking site and picked the ONE RATE that was an advanced deposit reservation. The way those work is when they pop us in our system, the advance deposit has to be MANUALLY processed, and usually our In-House reservations team does this. However, they don't work weekends. To top it off, when she made the reservation, she inadvertently made it for the following day, not the current day like she'd wanted. I changed it.\n\nI don't know what happened, but I received an angry phone call from her asshole significant other (the 3rd call I'd had from these people that night).\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling ___ hotel in ___ , my name is D, how may I direct your call?\n&gt;SO: Yeah, this is ___ , you made a reservation for ___ . Just cancel the fucking thing. You fucked it up.\n&gt;Me: Okay ...\n&gt;SO: Great fucking service you offer. Way to fucking go. It's a fucked up system. Your fucking customer service fucking sucks. Go fuck yourself.\n&gt;Me: - hangs up phone - \n\nI don't know what happened, but when he started using the 'f' word every other word, I didn't care to say anything more to him. I canceled his reservation and hung up. Contrary to popular belief, if you get verbally abusive with us, customer service reps CAN hang up on you. And I will. And I will enjoy it. I figured it was either hang up on the asshole or let my mother out...guess which one would get me in less trouble?\n\nBut yeah, that made me feel great. Thank God for wine.",

Sometimes the apps auto-approve, but a lot of the time they are directed to call in. One of these instances is where someone has a fraud alert on their credit report that requires us to call the customer at the phone number on the alert to verify that they are the one actually applying.\n\nMy last call of the day (literally 30 seconds before the end of my shift, of course), was from a lady applying at home. I pulled up her application and it was a duplicate, and the system tells me that and also which app was the original. So I asked her if she knew she had another application in from about 5 days ago.\n\nShe gave me every excuse as to why I shouldn't look at the original. She said things like \"well I did it in a hurry.... well I didn't think it would be approved so I didn't even try...well I think it was declined anyways...\" and finally I said well I still have to take a look at it, and she said \"ok, but I think the problem was that I have a fraud alert on my credit report.\" \n\nDing ding, huge red flag. So I pull up the original app, and lo and behold, the notes say that it was confirmed as fraud because the agent who worked that one saw the fraud alert and spoke with the real person to whom the information belonged. \n\nSo I tried to verify her using our procedures and of course she couldn't pass any of them. The last resort verification is to have them go to the store and bring a credit card that they have open for at least a year and they would call in to complete the verification. I told her that and she got really nervous and hung up. \n\nOk, if you're committing identity theft and you get caught, at least don't try it again at the same store. Sheesh. ",

I work tech support for the business side of a wireless carrier, so of course I get a lot of people who think that we can't possibly survive without their money and we should bend to every demand that crosses their mind.\n\nSo, one day, I get a call from a small business owner. Let's call this guy SEJO for reasons that will be explained in a bit.\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for calling Wireless Carrier, my name is Kinetic, how can I help?\n\n&gt;SEJO: Yes, hello, I'm SEJO, I'm the owner of Small Business. I just bought some new property for my business and I'm having trouble getting service there. I'm just calling to see what the deal is because we're kind of a small company and we can't afford for something like this to cost us money.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry to hear that, but I'd be happy to look into that for you. Before I do, thought, I need to just verify the account.\n\nVerification proceeds smoothly and I thought this was going to be an okay call. He certainly seemed reasonable enough. Fresh as I was, I didn't realize that a customer immediately bringing up their concern for money usually results in yelling if we can't immediately resolve their issue.\n\n&gt;Me: Alright, can I please get the address of the property you purchased\n\n&gt;SEJO: Sure it's xxxx xxxx Ave at City, State Zip Code.\n\nI pull up the address and this guy's property is in the middle of assfuck nowhere. It's just outside of our coverage area. I was glad I found the problem but I knew the guy was likely going to be irritated about it, so I tried to break it to him as gently as possible. We also offer signal boosters and I could see multiple active boosters in the area, so I knew it would help him.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, SEJO, I see hear that the address you gave me is just outside of our coverage area, however we do-\n\n&gt;SEJO: What do you mean it's outside of your coverage area?\n\n&gt;Me: ...Well, our network doesn't extend quite that far, but we have-\n\n&gt;SEJO: So you're telling me I'm paying for cellphone service but you guys can't even give it to me?!\n\n&gt;Me: Well, SEJO, we-\n\n&gt;SEJO: So what am I supposed to do now?!\n\nAt this point I was well aware that was dealing with a self-entitled jerk off, hence SEJO. So I let a silence hang for just a moment to see if he would keeping speaking before continuing\n\n&gt;Me: Well, SEJO, we do offer something called a Network Extender which would help to boost the coverage up to certain radius.\n\n&gt;SEJO: Oh, excellent, can you send me one of those?\n\nShit, his tone went from angry to genial in an instant. He was probably under the impression we offer it for free. He was outside of our coverage area so Business Care wouldn't even consider sending him one for free and I just didn't feel like dropping him off on some other poor rep when I knew they wouldn't be able to accommodate him. I decided to just grit my teeth and try to bull through.\n\n&gt;Me: Alright, I can hand you off to Business Care so you can purchase-\n\nOf course, he immediately interrupted.\n\n&gt;SEJO: Wait, you mean I have to *buy* this thing?!\n\n&gt;Me: Yes, sir. It's a one time charge of $150 for the equipment but there's no monthly-\n\n&gt;SEJO: Do you know who I am?! I own a multi-million dollar company! Other business are fighting for my services!\n\n\"Well then why can't you afford $150 piece of equipment?\" I immediately want to tell him. I keep it to myself, though, because I don't want to be fired after just completing training.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, but unfortunately you're outside of our coverage area, so we're not responsible for poor service in that area.\n\n&gt;SEJO: Why should I have to pay extra for a service I'm already paying for?!\n\n&gt;Me: Because we don't offer service in that area. I do see multiple boosters in that area, so this will definit-\n\n&gt;SEJO: You know what? Get me a manager. I want to talk to them.\n\nI flag down floor support, who are acting as quasi-managers for those of us who are new who takes the call and tells him that seeing as he was firmly outside of our coverage area, the booster would have to be purchased by him. The guy went into flat out denial and demanded we give it to him for free. After a back-and-forth that essentially amount to \"Nu-uh\", \"Yeah-huh\" the guy finally hung up.\n\nAnd that was my first experience with a bad customer.",

After I got back to the office I got surprised by 3 bad ratings with no feedback from neither of the 3 customers involved. One of them was from the player who came in through chat. Apparently he solved his own issue because seemingly his $installer wouldn't properly install and he needed to copy files manually to his appdata folder(This will never happen if your system does not have issues, has the appropriate amount of storage for the $installer to download the temporary data needed for the game, does not have a nazi tier antivirus that blocks anything remotely trying to do anything on your computer). Apparently this \"bug\" only happens to \"veteran players\" or \"players who use a non-default location to install their game\". How an installer can know if you're an old player **before** you are even able to login an account in any way, shape, or form, I will never know.",

Online shipping orders, tracking parcels, that fun stuff.  So I get a call today from a flustered woman trying to use one of our online tools to get flyers out. She's gotten to the last step, tries to complete the order, and the page spits out a generic \"we cannot process your order at this time, please call admin\". She has been trying to do this all week, has called in 3 times previously for help to no avail. I'm silently banging my head against the desk, this is gonna be a hard one. \n\n   So I go through basic troubleshooting with her, still spitting out the error. Tried a different browser, same results. Oookay then, I can escalate this, or, if you're willing we can try plan B. She chooses plan B. While we're doing this, we have a good banter going, and I can tell that even though this might be a long call, it will be a good one. My customer is nice and personable. This makes everything soo much easier on both ends. I knew she was already frustrated, she knew I was doing my best. The call center gods have smiled upon me. \n\nShe's using the \"pretty\" version of the software to get her flyers out. There's another version but it's not so pretty, just a form. We spend 25-30 minutes going through it just to have another error pop up, this time about a field that was not even showing up on the form. At this point, it's about an hour into the call and I'm running out of options before I have to escalate the issue. That takes 5 business days,  and she needs them out tomorrow. I'm wracking my brains to try to find a solution, the jobs aids aren't helping at this point. \n\n   Just as I'm about to start the escalation process,  I see an option for a kind of \"lite\" version of the software she's using. Hey, let's try this! By now she's up for anything that might work. We spend another 15ish minutes going through it, all the while keeping up a friendly conversation. Lo and behold, WE GOT THROUGH IT!!!!!! oh, wait, the 3rd party program she needs to print a crucial part of the order isn't working right, and the printer will only print the first page. Shit. The printer isn't my problem but she's been so great through this extremely frustrating  (on both ends) process. I wasn't about to give up on her at this point, even though I could have. Okee dokee, going into troubleshooting that isn't at all in my job description, we finally get it all sent off and printed. Nearly 2 hours after I said my greeting, I solved the problem that 3 previous agents couldn't. I felt like I had come out the other side of a battle with the computer and I won! \n\n   She then insists on speaking to my supervisor to commend my work. I'm shocked but greatful and I flag someone down. Now, while we were working through her order and chatting a bit, we had gotten onto the subject of coffee. I live for coffee. So does she apparently.  She asks if I have *huge green coffee chain* where I live. Nope, our city is too small I guess. When we want a really good cup of coffee that isn't *Canadian coffee chain* we go to *local coffee shop*. This is relevant. So she tells my sup stuff, and I'm reading the notes on what she's saying.  She asked my supervisor if she can send me a gift card for *Canadian coffee chain* via my email. Sup says sorry, agents can't accept gifts. Ok then. Then she asks to speak to me really quick before she hangs up. Tells me to drop by *local coffee shop* and give my name, says I'm wonderful, and hangs up. Alrighty then! \n\n So I go to the local coffee shop after my shift because I'm super curious. Guys, she rang up my local coffee shop to buy a 10$ gift card while she was in hold. I almost freaking cried. In a thankless job where I get paid to get yelled at, someone went out of their way to thank me for what they thought was excellent service. Faith in humanity restored for the day. I'm thinking of finding her account again tomorrow to send her a thank-you email or something. ",

I deal with angry customers, entitled customers, crying customers, customers who can't handle the simplest concepts and customers who don't speak English but insist on trying. I'm trapped. I have a family to support so I couldn't live with myself if I just quit. Im on the verge of a nervous breakdown I'm on several antidepressant and anxiety medicines ( something I never had to worry about before this job) and I'm literally considering whether death would be a preferable option to continuing this job. And I always have a fucking ear infection from the damn earpiece in my ear every god damn day.",

        "text": "I’ve been very fortunate since I switched what account I work for. I previously worked for a company that turned me into a blubbering-smoking-alcoholic simply because of the client base. The work was so stressful that I lost all of my hair (that has since grown back) and cried every other day at work. If it wasn’t the callers, it was the administration or my co-workers that made my life hell. After I got my last “declination” for promotion, I threw in the towel. I had been told, “it was heard that you dropped the ‘F’ bomb outside.” Well, of course I did, it was once in an extreme outcry as I had my third panic attack of the day after my 8th escalated call.  \nNow I work for the same overhead but for a new account. I’ve been here for two months and my life couldn’t be better. I got a substantial pay raise, work for the greatest supervisors in the whole building, have wonderful and uplifting co-workers, and far less stress and nicer callers. To top it all off, the company sent me on an all-expenses paid vacation for three days. The company feeds us twice a week, they have gifted us for the Holidays, and go out of their way to make sure we’re happy. (Happy workers make for happier customers, happier customers make for more money they spend.) I went a full month before I got my first escalated call, and it was minor. Someone upset about the failure of a co-worker to follow through with what they promised. It was fixed in a matter of hours and the customer was delighted. I know there will be struggles, but so far those struggles seem so small compared to what I dealt with before.  \nAfter I left the other company, others started to leave as well. I spoke with HR about the reasons I left since everyone else was afraid to speak up (the manager was that evil). They took the complaint to heart and things have started to get better there, but not much. They can’t keep staff due to stress and small wages.  \nMoral of the story? You can always make your life better. I was afraid to leave what I knew for the unknown. Now I’m kicking myself for not leaving sooner. I could have been much happier sooner. C'est La Vie.\n\nRegards, \nCCKitty",

        "text": "So years ago, I worked for a cell phone company. My life went to hell so I politely bowed out of my job on good terms. I've recently relocated and started not only employment, but phone service with them again. Now, I know how frustrating being a CSR can be. I'm pretty gentle on the phones with my customers, but also when I have to call customer care. Anywhere. My patience is (nearly) endless. When I resigned last time, I just cancelled my employee account instead of changing it to a regular account, which created endless problems trying to start employee service again and a lot of frustration on my end, but the answer seemed easy enough once I got it. The reps name has been changed for her own privacy. \n\nCSR: Hi this is Becky, how can I help you?\n\nMe: Hi Becky, my name is Gitsym and I'm going to have you look up my account by the BAN because I don't remember the phone number. The last 4 of my social is 0000.\n\nBecky: Okay, and your password?\n\nMe: Uh... It's been about five years, I don't remember the password, but I don't remember putting one on either. That's okay, I just have a simple question. I've got a DOC number for you to review to go along with it. \n\nBecky: Well, I could send verification to the phone number 5551112345 to access the account, and I don't need the doc. What's your question?\n\nMe: .... That phone number has been long cancelled... Thanks for reminding me what it was... Listen, SAC got back to me about how to change my account type from employee to regular, I just need to see if it has to be done by your coach or if it can be done at a store. \n\nBecky: Let me put you on a brief hold while I ask, o.k.? (She proceeds to put me on hold. That's fine. I understand. It's an odd request.) So I've spoken to my support about this, and unfortunately we won't be able to reactivate this account. You'll need to get in contact with SAC to get it reactivated. \n\nMe: Okay. Here's the deal, Becky. I've been in contact with SAC and this is what they've told me. I'm not trying to reactivate this account, its been five years and it's long past that point. I just need to change the account type from employee to regular. If you would review the doc I told you about, you'd see that this is within your scope of support. \n\nBecky: Fine. What's the doc number? \n\nMe: 123455 \n(At this point she asks to put me on hold again. Which is still fine. I still get it.)\n\nBecky: Okay so, I've talked with my support again and they said that reactivating this-\n\nMe: I am NOT trying to reactivate this account. I am simply trying to change.. Ok. Know what? See the account type in the top middle of your system? See how it says special/employee? I need that to say individual/regular. \n\nBecky: ....alright, but in order to restore this account (-_-) you need to contact SAC. I can send you their email address if the email gitsym@gitsym.com is still active. \n\nMe: .... I don't think you're understanding me. I do not want to reactivate this account. I do not want to restore this account. I just need to change the account type. From special/employee. To individual/regular. If you look about halfway down the page of the doc I gave you, it clearly states that a coach or senior rep can make that change. And I just need to know at this point if a retail manager can do it as well. \n\nBecky: ....right. Well, let me put you on hold so I can ask about this new information. (At this point I'm pretty sure she's just going to transfer me out, but she doesn't.) So I sent my senior the doc you gave me, and he says we can easily do this for you. But you have a password on your account. \n\nMe: ....Uh huh. So. If I go to a store. And verify who I am with picture ID. Either they can make the change there, or they can call CC to verify that I am who I say I am and make the change? \n\nBecky: Absolutely. \n\nMe: Fantastic. Becky, can I have your last initial and rep id please? \n\nBecky: Sure. A, and 55443. May I ask why?\n\nMe: Yeah, because you didn't even fully verify my account and you still gave me the full phone number and email address on it, neither of which I remembered. I'm turning this call in to my coach for review. Violation of CPNI. Have a nice day. \n\nBonus: Store verified with me that there was no password on the account. She pulled that out of her ass.",

I pull up the order, it's a guy that's unhappy with his thing that I emailed earlier.\"\n\nMe: \"Can you send him to my voicemail? I'm going on break in 2 minutes.\"\n\nCoworker: \"......it's okay, I'll just talk to him.\"\n\nAnd my hear my coworker who I sit close to take all the heat. She gets off the phone and gives me a look. I feel horrible. I lose my appetite for lunch and I spend the next 29 minutes of my legally-enforced break in distress.\n\nI get back and call the guy because he was asking for me.\n\nThe guy: \"Blah blah blah blah. I'm going to post all over facebook and instagram that YOU, Gatoraay, were the reason I'm NEVER ordering from your company AGAIN, it's all YOUR fault. Blah blah blah blah.\"\n\nI explain everything about the thing he's not happy with.

I have a history of depression and a self-blaming mentality. I felt bad that I made my coworker talk to him. I feel less bad that he threatened me, and more bad that I let his stupid threats get to me in the first place. I was working in email all day, and other representatives deal with much worse customers much more often, and here I am getting worked up about a single escalated customer transfer. I was not made for this job, I soak emotions up like a sponge.\n\nI'm trying to start a website in my free time to put on my resume/portfolio so I can get out of this job. But I have to use my free time which is limited because I'm working overtime all the time now.\n\nSorry, this is more of a cry for help than a story. I would consider psychological counseling, but I cannot justify it because I simply don't make enough.\n\nOh, and to the guy that acted this way, I know you are pulling a bluff, we both know that my company has the most competitive prices on the market and you'd be damned to not consider us again. However, FUCK YOU for waving your gun in the air and manipulating your way to the front of the line.

Initially, I'd gotten in at some pretty big companies (major insurer, major telecom company) being sold a bill of goods that the call center was a foot in the door to advance. At THREE different offices I was ACTIVELY sabotaged by higher-ups in my efforts to show my stuff and maneuver into a position I actually wanted to be in. I got (figuratively) screwed by a director of marketing, a director of communications, and most recently, I got to do the work of assisting a social media director but without losing any of my old call center responsibilities, without any increase in pay, and without the title. Currently, I'm still doing call center shit for a nonprofit healthcare office, oftentimes functioning as trainer/assistant manager, but again, no increase in title or pay. So I want to move on again. But ugh, HOW. \n\nThe thought of just continuing the exercise in futility by going to another call center for a \"foot in the door\" just makes me want to kick someone. I sure won't even consider another call center job that's any less than $17 an hour because any less is not nearly worth the bullshit. I LOVE my current employer. It's just that they run so lean, and the turnover in the department I actually want to be in is so low, that I could reasonably foresee being stuck here for 10 years. I took a $2/hour pay cut to come here, going from getting by and putting back some savings now and then to cleaning out my savings and having to ask my parents for money to bail out of an overdraft JUST from paying my basic bills, buying groceries, ONE christmas gift, and an ER copay for a cracked foot bone. So not only am I soul-drained daily, but I'm not even truly getting by anymore.\n\nAt wit's end. If you'd like to dialog in PM about working to leverage my way out of this mess, I'd be much obliged. If this can be just a sounding-off board to help people in general, that's cool too. I wouldn't be working where I am now if I wasn't up for helping other folks.",

He's calm and has a legitimate issue.\n\nI go through the process to bring up his order.\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you for your information Mr. Doe...\n\n&gt;SR: That's REVEREND Doe.\n\n&gt;Me: My apologies.  It appears that the textbook you are missing is on back-order, but good news.  We're expecting it any day now and once we get it, it'll ship out to you via 2nd day air!\n\n&gt;SR: Why wasn't I notified of this?\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry that you weren't notified, sir.  Typically we ema...\n\n&gt;SR: You will address me as REVEREND.\n\n&gt;Me: Again, my apologies Mr. Doe *crap*...\n\n&gt;SR: Listen here you little s***  If any member of my church had shown such a blatant lack of respect to me like you have I would kick them out of my church.\n\n&gt;Me: Again, my apologies.  I'm not trying to be disrespectful.  It's a simple force of habit.\n\n&gt;SR: You're a cocky little f*** aren't you?  You think you're tough s*** because you're on the phone and think I can't get to you.  I have no problem driving to your office in *my* *city* and beating some respect into you.\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, I'm ending this call now.  Have a great day Mr. Doe.  *click*\n\nI then proceeded to shoot an email to my supervisor with the details and the suggestion that she pull the call and send it up the chain.\n\nI was reading another story on here and a comment made me think of this call.  I pulled the information (thank goodness for my Hall of Infamy).  Apparently the higher ups took this very seriously.  They passed the call onto the school.  Per the flag on the account \"Student was removed from school and no longer allowed to do business with us due to abuse to agents from the parents\".  Sweet, sweet justice",

Bargain! \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo people buy said products and of course PayPal is the only accepted method of payment, alarm bells should now be deafening, but they are ignored for the chance of being able to give the whole family a brand new Iphone each.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nItems do not arrive and seller can not be contacted,  surprise surprise, cue the call to the bank where people like myslef have to deal with the fall out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCustomer: \"I wonder if you can help me, I have paid £1000 to IVana Ripuoff, it was a Eastern European website selling cheap apple products as they were apparently damaged boxes and can not sell full price.  I bough 5 Iphones and I have not recieved them, can I get my money back please\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nME: \"Ok lets take a look. I see this was taken as a Direct Debit payment by PayPal,\" (Now I have to let them down gently) \"Due to the way PayPal have taken this money out of your account, you are not covered by the Direct Debit Guarantee as this is between a third party and not PayPal.  You will have to speak to PayPal and get them to refund the money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCustomer \"F**K YOU, You can not do that, I already spoken to PayPal they said they can not do anything and the payment has to be paid back by you! \".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nArguments then begin with a never ending repetitiveness off \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe:\"We are not obliged to make these payments as it is not our error, it is up to PayPal to refund you.\"\nC:\" but they will not and say its you\"\nMe:\"I am sorry they are wrong, if they will not cover this then you will have to get further advice from Citizens Advice or Lawyer. \nC: (more ranting and swearing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nEven if they had used a card to make payment it can often be a nightmare for the customer, as a bank we can dispute debit card payments, but the merchant name has to be visible on the transaction, many Paypal transactions come out with no reference to the merchant, especially those who know how to mask and prevent these details appearing on the transaction, as PayPal are third party we can not legally recover money from them as it is not their money either.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven if we can pursue the payment it can sometimes take months before any money is recovered, if at all. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCustomers will then ask to speak to fraud department, knowing that we will just repay money back into the account if fraud had taken place, this also results in many angry people, as this is not the type of fraud we cover, as it is a contractual agreement willingly entered into by the customer. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are a few other points which I will not bore you with, but basically this time of year there are lots of stupid people with lots of money waiting to be parted from them. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf something is too good to be true then it usually is, and result will be tears, wave goodbye to that money as the bank will not pay you for your stupidity. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh to be able to instantly end that call with a Nelson Ha HA and \"serves you right you greedy fool\".\n\n",

        "text": "I've worked (from home) for an online retailer for a little over a year, taking calls. We farm out our emails to a place in India that's been hit by flooding so there's been this huge backlog, and a lot of the calls I've been dealing with are people following up on their emails. I feel badly for some of them because a lot of their requests are time sensitive and after a certain point there isn't anything that can be done.\n\nEven with the seasonal employees everything is way behind. I used to get 45 minutes off the phone during my 5-hour shift but they usually remove 30 minutes of that so I just get my legally-required 15 minute break.\n\nWe used to have team meetings every week but they got rid of those as well. \n\nI understand that they have to do these things in times like these but it reminds me of how inflexible this job can be, and since I'm here, there are a few other things I'd like to vent about.\n\nIt's difficult to request time off even during regular, non-holiday periods. You always have to put in your request weeks in advance and then cross your fingers that it'll get approved. This is still so strange to me as I've never had a job where requesting time off was such a crapshoot. \n\nThey generally aren't flexible even when you want to work. Since I'm part time I don't get paid days off, but I managed to be called for jury duty earlier this year. My shift starts at 3 and I was usually home from court around 4. I asked if I could start my shift at 4 and they said no. Looking back, maybe I should've pushed against that more, as I felt I was being forced to take unpaid time off.\n\nI worry that I'll be stuck on the phones for God knows how long. Even though my metrics are generally pretty good, I'd still have to wait for openings in other departments, which are few and far between. \n\nThe monotony, micromanagement, and sometimes arbitrary QA comments are getting to me and burning me out. It feels like I've been working here so much longer than I actually have, which makes me think it's not sustainable. Working from home is great in many ways but also isolating. \n\nI know basically all call centers work this way, and what I've said is nothing new. But it's really starting to hit me that I might be yet another high turnover casualty.",

        "text": "Hello, everyone. I'm new to this subreddit. I've been working in a particular call center since mid-june, and *boy* do I have some stories to share! This particular story is about a customer who suggested I kill myself, but used poor wording to do it.\n\nI want to preface this with a warning: My customer used, ahem, very *colorful* language, if you will. I think it's a bit funnier with the cussing included. Mods, if you have a problem with this, let me know and I will edit them out.\n\nThis particular kerfuffle occurred about a month into my job. I work for a very well known European car manufacturer, and we provide roadside assistance to every brand under the \"umbrella\" of the main company, if you will.\n\nSo, I'm about halfway through a 10 hour shift, and things have been going fairly smooth. A few disgruntled customers, mainly due to the fact that I left my company issued magic wand at home that day, and couldn't get a tow truck to them within 20 minutes. \"Don't you know who **I** am?! blah^blah^blah ...\n\nI get a call from a redneck, who is clearly irritated as soon as I answer the phone. But hey, no one is really in a great mood when their car is fucking up, so I shrug it off and go through my scripting.\n\nDude has a flat tire, but managed to make it to a gas station just off the highway. I'm not sure if anyone here is familiar with \"run-flat tire technology\", but basically these tires act as their own spares. As long as the sidewall isn't damaged, and there at least an inch and a half between the rim and the ground, you can keep driving on these puppies for about 50 more miles on 0 psi, give or take.\n\nThe downside to this is that we often get incredulous customers going, \" *What do you mean my car doesn't have a spare?*\". Either that, or they're completely clueless as to whether or not they have the run flats or not. Anyway. The conversation goes something like this:\n\nMe: \"Alright sir, I just need to gather a little information to pull up your file.\"\n\nCustomer: \"*My name is X. My phone number is (xxx)xxx-xxxx.\"\n\nM: \"Thank you sir. And would you happen to have your VIN number handy?\"\n\nC: \"The fuck is a Veen?\" (shit you not, that's how he says it)\n\nM: \"Your Vehicle Identification Number, sir. It's 16 characters long, letters and numbers, and you can find it on your registration as well as your insurance card.\"\n\nC: \"Gimme a fuckin' second. Becky? **BECKYYY!!!!** Where the **fuck** is Becky?!\"\n\nM: -is awkwardly silent-\n\nC: \"Alright, here's your damn number.\" *proceeds to only give the numbers in the VIN, and leaves out all of the letters*\n\nM: \"Okay sir, I'm going to need both the number and the letters.\"\n\nAt this point, he's fuming. His wife, Becky, has gone MIA. He has no idea what a VIN is, and I assume that having a young woman explain to him what a VIN is and that he needs to provide all of the characters hurt his big redneck ego. I finally get his file pulled up, and I see that he has run-flat tires.\n\nM: \"I'm seeing here that your vehicle has run-flats, sir. Is the PSI warning on your dash yellow, or red?\"\n\nC: \"What? You mean you can't see it?\"\n\nM: \"......No, sir. My computer doesn't give me the readings from your vehicle's computer.\"\n\nC: \"That's not what I asked, you dumb bitch! I *said* CAN. YOU. SEE. IT.\"\n\nM: *at this point I've had enough of his shit* \"No, sir. I'm in (state) and you're in (other state).\"\n\nC: \"Don't get smart with me, woman! **WHERE THE FUCK IS BECKY GOD DAMNIT?!**\"\n\nM: \"I.....I don't know.\"\n\nC: *speaking to his kids* \"You go and find your mother right fucking now, or I swear to god I will punch her god damn face in! I've had it with her shit! I'll knock the goddamn teeth right out of her goddamn skull! I ain't fuckin' around!\"\n\nAt this point, I'm looking up local police in his area. This man is clearly deranged, and is threatening to pulverize his wife. All of our calls are recorded 'for quality assurance', so it wouldn't be an issue to prove he was threatening his wife. In the meantime, I try to get him back on track.\n\nM: \"Sir, in order to provide you with the best service possible today, I need you to tell me what color that warning light is.\"\n\nC: \"REDREDREDREDREDFUCKINRED\"\n\nM: \"Excellent. And how long ago did it turn red?\"\n\nC: \"IDONTFUCKING *unintelligible* MIDDLEOFGODDAMN *unintelligible* BECKY. I. SWEAR. *unintelligible* FUCKIN'. BECKY!\"\n\nM: \"Okay sir, in the interest of safety for you and your family, as well as to prevent any further damage to your vehicle, I'm going to recommend that we have you towed in today.\"\n\nC: \"Towed? **TOWED?** You can't send out some (racial slur) to change my tire?\"\n\nM: *explains run flat technology. explains that there is no spare. explains that we cannot deliver a spare to him. apologizes.*\n\nC: \"So you can't change my tire?\"\n\nM: \"No, sir.\"\n\nC: \"You're useless, you fucking cunt. Useless, just like all ya'lls kind. Why do they even hire women for your job? Clueless, dumb bitch.\"\n\nM: \"I need to ask you to refrain-\"\n\nC: \"You know what? Screw this, I'm calling AAA. You've done nothing but waste my precious fucking time.\"\n\nM: \"Alright. I'm sorry I couldn't be of further assistance today, but I hope you have a MUCH. better day. Would you like me to terminate the call for you?\"\n\nC: \"Why don't you go terminate yourself?\"\n\nM: *unsuccessfully trying to stifle my laughter, because at this point I'm picturing myself as The Terminator, leaping off of an overpass to crush this man into fleshy goo*, \"That was unnecessary.\" -*click-\n\nAfter I hung up on the guy, I look up to find that every CSR within a 5 cubicle radius and staring at me with the most befuddled looks on their faces. Apparently, he was so loud that everyone could hear him, word for word. After about 2 seconds of glancing around, I erupted into laughter, told my boss I needed a cigarette, handed her all the info for the police department and the customer's location, and took an extra long break.\n\nAh, the joys of working with the (rich, entitled) public!\n\n**TL;DR: Women are useless. I'm a dumb cunt. REDNECK SMASH!**\n\n*Edit: a letter*",

In worst case, I will spend the Xmas in slippers, eating through my savings.\n\nI never thought I would do such thing, as even the companies I hated received my one month resignation notice.\n\nHowever, after busting my arse doing two people's job - or rather guesswork - at the same time, without any training ('oh you will pick it up naturally'), being expected to talk to customers on the phone and process difficult orders and administration AT THE SAME TIME, for £900 a month, I'm done.\n\nWe provide service to the most pretentious twats imaginable, bored housewives suffering from empty nest syndrome and rabid menopause, claiming we ruined their life because they didn't have their £9000 curtains delivered in time to show off at Christmas dinner, grown up men who will throw a tantrum because we didn't address them 'Baron'/'Reverend','Viscount', although they didn't introduce themselves properly in the first place because WE SHOULD ALREADY KNOW, self righteous cunts who will pretend they don't understand my accent because they're too posh to try (I don't have a heavy accent, having spoken English for over 10 years and lived here for the last 5 years), and then they send long hand written letters to CEO because they received 'appaling' customer service.\n\nOn top of that, managers who treat us like a nuisance anytime we ask an important, technical question, and then get all pissy when we work it out by ourselves and make mistakes.\n\nThe whole department, company even, runs on lies and empty promises.\n\n'Yes of course we will call you back, oh no one called yet? oh I do sincerely apologize that we have fallen short of our usually brilliant service!'\n\n'Oh you would like to speak to a manager, let me see if someone's available (quick look at my managers, noooope, they're not having it, too busy talking about nails and babies) I'm so sorry, I have been told they are in the meetings at the moment, I will request that they call you back straight after' (bullshit, I've been trying to speak to them for a month about my holidays)\n\nSo yeah, tomorrow will be glorious. And after I get home, there will be pizza, mulled wine and 'Sabrina The Teenage Witch' waiting for me.\n\nThanks for reading this. I hope you get to quit your miserable jobs too, you're worth so much more than that. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/3vwu3h/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_overnight_shift/",
        "text": "I was curious to know how the overnight shift works at the call centers where you guys work at? Do they make more money? Are the agents who work overnight generally considered better agents? Or do most people think they are slackers?\n\nHere's why I ask:\n(Sorry, it's a bit long.)\n\nI've been working at a call center for a mid-sized cable / ISP company for just over 6 years now, the past 4 years being strictly on the overnight shift. \n\nDuring the day there are normally 2 departments: CSR's (who troubleshoot TV service issues &amp; handle billing calls) &amp; TSR's (who troubleshoot Internet &amp; telephone service issues). There are yearly raises until you hit the hourly pay cap, which differs depending on which department you work in. TSR's pay cap is about $2-$3 an hour more than CSR's since they generally have to be a little more tech savvy to troubleshoot Internet issues. \n\nThe overnight shift is expected to be able to take both TSR &amp; CSR calls. However, we recently found out that our pay cap is the same as a CSR. So TSR's are making more than overnight agents, even though overnighters are expected to the same exact job, plus what CSR's do, plus work shitty hours. \n\nI started at the company as a part time TSR then got hired onto the overnight shift full time about a year and a half later. At the time I was under the impression that it was a promotion, since I had to interview and get hired for the position and because I now had double the responsibilities as I did when I was just a TSR. So I was pretty disappointed when I found out that I now make less than I would be had I stayed as a TSR. \n\nI discussed my frustration about it to my supervisor (who is a TSR supervisor by the way, because overnighters don't have our own supervisor) and he agreed with me that we should be making at least what TSR's make, but he had no control over it. He suggested that I write a letter to the VP of Customer Service and place it in her suggestions box she has outside of her office.  So I did. I wrote a 1 page letter, describing in detail all the extra duties overnight agents have and questioned why we make less than everyone else. I also made sure to be very diplomatic in my wording. \n\nHer response was basically because we don't take the same volume of calls as daylight, they couldn't justify paying us the same rate; and that if I was wanting to move back to daylight to talk to my supervisor about it. \n\nSo now I'm even MORE frustrated, not only because I think her response was complete bullshit, but I talked to my supervisor about possibly moving back to a daylight position and he told me I'd have to wait until there is a full time opening, I can't just move back whenever I want to. So now I'm stuck. \nWhat's even worse is I don't really want to move back to daylight. I get along with all my overnight coworkers really well and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of the overnight shift. I dread just thinking about going back to daylight where you get micro-managed to hell. I just want to be paid appropriately. \n\nPlus, there have recently been a ton of openings in the Network Operations department, which I would love to move into, but I've applied multiple times and haven't even been interviewed once. Part of me feels like being on the overnight shift is part of the reason why I'm not being interviewed. Whether it's because the hiring managers have no clue who I am or because they think everyone on the overnight shift are slackers, I'm not sure. \n\nAnyway, any and all input / feedback is appreciated! Thanks for taking the time to read my rant!",

        "text": "Ive been at my job for two years. It's an in house call center for a large charity organization. It's so awful. All of the other departments have flexible schedules except us. \n\nThe people who donate to us are usually kind hearted, but the stupidity is absolutely astonishing. People sometimes call to give a new card and ask if they need to give us the whole number. \n\n90% of callers are 70+ years old. Most do not understand the concept of our website. \n\nI'm a college a graduate but stuck making 13 an hour. My friends who work in restaurants make at least twice as much as I do. I do the same thing every day and my job is extremely monotonous. I don't do emails or anything anymore. Just phone calls and then mindless data entry. I feel like I've wasted two years of my life. Ive grown stupider as a result. Ive become cold an uncaring. Ive gone from a vivacious young man to feeling like I lost my balls. Our department is incredibly female dominated. All my managers and bosses aside from the CEO are women. I always considered myself a feminist and down for equality but I feel like working in this industry has made me more woman like. I'm less likely to be assertive. I just have to sit there and take it. Whether it's calls from donors or whatever new project or script other departments decide we need to push. I just sit back and take it like a lubed up ragdoll. \n\nI think that's why there's so many women in this profession. They're used to putting up with a lot of shit. I can't believe the creepy old fucks who call in just to speak to certain women. I can't believe the women put up with the conversations and don't try to be boring or cold to get them to hang up. I guess we need that money. Some dudes just call to chat. \n\nThere's no proactive role for us. I hated the job the moment I started but I said I'd stay for a year to build my resume. One year turned into two...my spirit is crushed. Every time the phone rings my adrenaline spikes. I instantly disdain people calling in even though most of them mean well and want to do good in the world. I hate the anxious and nervousness of some people who call in. You can tell they lead busy lives. So many housewives and retired people who call us and have nothing else to worry about other than their sponsored child, many of whom imagine them to be adopted or their own flesh and blood. The old women who cry on the phone when someone leaves the program. I feel like I either end up taking on callers anxieties or I end up being a cold uncaring asshole. \n\nIm just venting here. Don't even really expect any replies. I just can't believe this is the life I've chosen for myself. I honestly fantasize about being homeless that's how much I hate my lifestyle. Fuck 8-5, fuck being the bottom rung of a company where you have no power and get shat on. I rebel by being incredibly lazy and am always on my phone on Reddit or whatever but no one complains. Tbh I've been hoping to get fired for well over a year because I hate this so much. \n\nNo offense but I work with plenty of people who barely graduated high school. They're great, but I can't help but feel like an extreme failure. We have interns from a local high school who work with us. They basically do the same work I do aside from a few things. I feel so underutilized. I'm not a math person but it feels like I know how to do calculus but my job only allows me to add and subtract. \n\nI know I have it \"good\" compared to other call center jobs. I don't have as many calls as others do. I don't deal with as many angry calls as others. It still sucks though. My personal life is awful, it used to be okay but now I come home from work and isolate myself until the next day. Drugs and alcohol no longer allow me to cope. What girl would want to be with some guy in a call center who hates his life? I legit want to kill one of my coworkers who robbed me. I never could do that, but it really sucks. I know who did it but have no proof. I absolutely detest this individual but have to see her or him everyday. I used to consider myself a peaceful love everyone type and now I fantasize about murder daily. \n\nCall centers are the worst.",

I \"wasn't engaging with the customer enough.\" I've had a hoarse voice for about a month because I can't rest it as I talk for a living!!! He had the ops manager sit in on our meeting and went so far as to say my AHT is too low. I work as a pharmacy tech and talk to doctors offices all day getting approvals for meds for their patients, half of them are already pissed/in a hurry because they think its stupid they have to call us in the first place! They always thank me for being so fast at the end of the call! And a majority of them tell me to \"feel better soon\" needless to say I am now on a corrective action for my \"tone and speeding through the call\". Jesus freaking Christ this guy is a classic idiot, always dicking around or out smoking. He doesn't even know how to do my job.",
