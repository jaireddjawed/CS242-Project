Why not other particles?\n\nSometimes it is understandable that something is an adverb like 急に, other times there's your usual directional meaning like in に行く, but what about points I mentioned above? I cannot connect the meaning of に to the meanings of the particle used by itself. Is there any logic behind the choice of に or is it just something that happened historically for some reason?",

I love coffee and when I want to order something from a coffee shop in the US, I just ask if they use arabica beans, as that’s the type of bean I like (location of said bean doesn’t really matter). I’m sure they have arabica beans in Japan, but I would like to know how to ask for it. I know that coffee beans is コーヒー豆. But I don’t know what arabica would be translated to.

I'm also looking for a tool to create my own decks, and I just hate Anki :( So i've been trying to use JPDB (so much content and the UI is awesome!).\n\nThe one think I don't understand is - how does one studies more than one deck at a time? I have to keep switching the order of the decks I'll pull the new words from; is there any other way (maybe hidden inside the Patreon configs) that I'm not aware of?\n\nAlso, the feature I love the most about WK is that I can **write** down the kanji/vocab word in Japanese (an check if I wrote it correctly). This helps me a LOT while learning, even more than just looking at the meaning in Japanese and its translation. Is there a way to make it work? Otherwise I'm thinking about writing a plugin for JPDB :D \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all :D",

        "text": "As mysterious as Japanese kanji readings can get, there is actually some (and I really mean only \"some\"!) level of consistency in kanji on-yomi readings across similar looking kanji.  \n\nThis applies to about 60% of the Jouyou kanji and are known as 形声 (けいせい)(keisei) characters. For example, the on-yomi of the kanji 吾 is ご(go)、and the on-yomi of the kanji 語 is also ご(go).  \n\nThere are around 100 of these components that indicate an on-yomi reading.  \n\nAnother example would be  \"粦\" which isn't a *really* kanji in itself, but rather a component used in other kanji. Its on-yomi is りん(rin). And with this knowledge you'll also have an idea of what all these other, rather frightening looking kanji's on-yomi are:  隣、燐、鱗、麟. That's right they are all りん(rin)!  \n\nI made an Anki deck to help learn these kanji phonetic components.  \n\nWhile there are many kanji that are not 形声 (けいせい)(keisei) characters, a good chunk of them are. So, working on the deck can make remembering how to read words easier.  \n\nYou can find the Anki deck at my site, there's a download link after the screenshots of the deck.  \n\n[Link to the deck page](https://learnjapanese.moe/kanjiphonetics/)\n\nThere are a few pitfalls of this that you should keep in mind when doing the deck.  \n\nFor some components, there are exceptions to the rule and other on-yomi readings that it may also carry. For every component in the deck, a \"confidence\" rating, and exceptions are shown. This \"confidence\" rating is how sure you can be that a kanji with that component has that on-yomi.  \n\nKanji readings do not end at on-yomi, neither do they end at just learning how they are read. In order to build kanji reading proficiency, there are other factors involved such as reading words that those kanji are used in.    \n\n\nNevertheless, I think this deck will be useful to your Japanese learning journey. I had fun making the deck and even as someone that can already read Japanese, I got better at remembering kanji readings because there were components I didn't know shared an on-yomi before!",

I use Tae Kim's guide for grammar (and a Hungarian source too)  \n\n\nBut I'd like some advice how you guys learn kanji with vocabs? Do you write the entire words down a few times? Or do you try to write sentences with it? I usually listen to japanese pod 101 vocab list, or something similar to get a hold on the word, then make my own flashcard on paper with one side on English/hungarian the other written with kanji and furigana under it, but it doesn't seem like a good practice to learn Kanji, as I remember the word, but I often don't remember the kanji.

I've used the course for over a year now and progressed in a steady pace through their A1, and A2 books which some sources say would put me somewhere in the N4 level. \n\nThe first four courses have been amazing. I loved the interactivity, the mix of listening, speaking (recording) and grammar lessons all oriented by somewhat real-life scenarios and situations. It really helped me and I could feel the progress I did and was so motivated when I started to pick up more and more stuff in Japanese media. I'd recommend it to anyone who's starting out.\n\nBut it all started to change in the later A2 books, where the amount &amp; frequency of new grammar points and vocabulary ramped up quite a lot. This is also the part where I first started to experience some frustration with the online course format. \n\nWith each lesson you watch a drama with some new grammar points that you're supposed to revisit during the course and get a deeper understanding of. Which sounds great in theory but what it boils down to in the later lessons is 3 different grammar points back to back with minimal explanation first and then exercises.\n\nThe explanations are downloadable PDFs with a break down of a grammar point like \" V‑ なく なりました \" along with often just a single sentence explaining the usage  like \"Say this if you want to say your freezer broke\" without ever really delving into the grammar / linguistics along with 4-6 example sentences. \n\nAnother recent example was \" V1‑ ないで V2\" which was explained with: \" Used when doing something without doing a certain action.\" - somehow my brain just didn't understand that wording at all 😅 It got clear after watching a YT vid delving a bit deeper with some easier example sentences.\n\nPair that with grammar exercises that are sometimes too difficult, be it because I didn't understand the explanations before as well as I thought I did or because new vocabulary is randomly introduced. I get that you can't expect to know every single word but often these are crucial words to understand. \n\nOften they also inject grammar points you've learned a few lessons back into the exercises for new grammar points. Which is good I guess but it's also often frustrating when you feel like you haven't even grasped the basic concept yet and the first exercise is to conjugate this verb you've never seen into the past tense and also apply this new grammar point (just a made up example).\n\nI feel like this has to do with the fact that Marugoto started out as a classroom book and especially with these later courses I get the feeling that they're probably more supplemental and would really benefit you having someone there to explain certain points in detail. It also doesn't help that there's way more material on every other textbook like Genki or Minna no Nihongo.\n\nI guess I'm also a bit frustrated because I enjoyed the earlier courses so much and hit a slope with this one. But I hope at least that this writeup gives you some insight if you've been thinking about giving the series a try 🙂",

I do have a bit of familiarity with Japanese from the typical \"grew up watching anime\" but I finally decided to start in on studying it on the side. Going into it, I knew that kanji can be read in different ways, on and kun. So I thought \"I just need to learn the 2 different ways to read each kanji\" or something. \n\nAlready daunting, but as I'm starting and looking up different kanji I find that each one seems to have a multitude of readings; i.e., I looked up  食 and it listed 4 different kun readings and 2 different on readings. Obviously I know that たべ　is one reading because I learned it in that context, but how does one go about learning all the different readings? Experienced people - do you just wait and learn the new readings as they come along in context, or do you try to memorize all the readings as you learn new kanji? \n\nI've come across a lot of kanji study pages that have a little box to write the on reading and kun readings(like this: [(example)](https://external-preview.redd.it/8iAAlAKwGZs9mGUouxuFOSbkFMEfak72BQyI7R2Zh1I.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=175b2ddc0904870c6d25da0d10bed3d9f62114c2) \\- for people have used these, do you write all the readings or just choose one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this is a really dumb question but coming from studying languages with alphabets and then Chinese (with only one reading per character), I'm a bit overwhelmed and I want to start off on the right foot for the most effective studying!",

While I understand most of what is said in/about the game, I am not yet great at forming and writing out thoughts in Japanese. I'm wondering whether it would be ok for me to type in English, and simply let Japanese players know they can speak Japanese to me. Since the game relies on teamwork in certain areas, I don't want to make other players' experience worse by speaking a language they have trouble understanding. I tried looking it up on google, but most results are about Japanese people's ability to speak English. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "Hello! I studied Japanese very seriously for about 6 months. In that time I became decent in that I could read and type in both Kana and learned some basic kanji. I learned basic grammar and about 500 ish word I think. Since then I have gotten very busy with school and was no longer able to study, but I was able to keep up my practice by talking with natives. I made many native Japanese speaker friends and was able to chat with them with text and on call. I am not able to converse with them since I can make sentences faster but my vocabulary and grammar are lacking. I have more time now and want to start learning again. I will start Anki to learn new words but I am tired of looking at a screen. For grammar and situational practice I want to learn from a book. I tried Genki but it is pretty boring. Are there any books that teach Japanese that are not so classroom textbook formatted, but rather in a more intuitive and interesting way for self studying? I am not a complete beginner so something that's not from scratch is preferable. I appreciate all recommendations.",

        "text": "I just wanted to share this to encourage anybody who isn't a super-crammer who is on track to reach N2 level in 6 months because I found it quite off-putting when I first started learning - even though it is super impressive and those who are able to do so should be incredibly proud of themselves! It can be quite daunting to feel like you're making no progress so I wanted to share where I'm at after 365 days.\n\n- I could order food in a restaurant and ask for a menu, but I would struggle with payment and buying things in a konbini\n- I have learned around 60 kanji, and tonnes of the Wanikani radicals\n- I could introduce myself but I get a lot of words muddled up with each other\n\nThat's literally it! My goal was just to learn any amount of Japanese every single day. There were months where this included WaniKani, Renshuu, Genki textbooks and Duolingo (I know Duo isn't perfect but it's been quite useful for vocab) all in one day, and I even got a tutor at one point. I first realised that I would be moving a lot slower than most people when I saw tonnes of people saying you could learn hiragana/katakana in a matter of days and both took me weeks to master!\n\nSadly a member of my close family passed away and I had to greatly reduce the amount of resources I was using as I was struggling, but I still stuck to my goal every day even if it was just one Duolingo lesson. \n\nI know this probably sounds appalling progress-wise to a lot of this community as Japanese learning is quite competitive, but I'm so proud of myself and I just wanted to share my learning journey so far. I've never been an academically motivated person and I struggle with my mental health alongside a 9-5 so this is huge for me. I'm definitely going to pick back up with my tutor on Preply ASAP going forward. We can only do our best ☺️\n\nGood luck everybody!",

        "text": "I have been studying for about 2.5 years and the route I have taken looks something like this:\n\n1. Basics and whatnot\n2. Learn meanings of 2200 kanji\n3. Read and study sentences in a 6K core deck with the focus on trying to learn kanji readings (and no, it was not kanji readings in isolation)\n4. Now I'm in the middle of using this 6K core deck for actual vocabulary SRS'ing.\n\nThis whole time also includes watching native content a lot and reading a bit less.\n\nMy weakest area is speaking, which is to be expected. But I do have Japanese online friends I love playing and hanging out with, so I do want to put some focus on this area. And now that I shared my kanji and \"being able to read\" focused study method, I can see this annoying pattern that happens for quite a lot of words:\n\n1. I get a new word from my anki vocabilary deck. I know the meanings and readings for the kanji it has, so I can guess the word quite often. Especially since I have a japanese example sentence on the front side.\n2. The word is very easy every time, so I click easy, and I don't see those words very often.\n3. At some point I see the word after it's interval has grown for many many months and completely forgot that I should know this word, but it's still easy to me.\n\nSo yeah, the problem is that the words don't really stick and I can't recall them, but seeing or hearing them in the anki deck is easy. Now I'm wondering what's the best use of my time to start being able to recall these words better. Just read more, drop the pre-made deck and start building my own? That sounds smart in general, but will it help with the recalling in conversations? Is it just expected that recall builds up very slowly and I don't have to worry about it?  \nSo before I decide on a daily habit with some new learning method, I would like to hear some opinions from others.",

If all of the words are in one deck, words I threw in may not appear for a while. I do flashcards every single day so it may not be too much of an issue, but I'd like to see if there's any more efficient ways to go about vocabulary. Maybe categorized decks or something along those lines?",
