For example I’ve tried both on duo and English moves faster, but I suspect the learning will be more durable from Spanish because there is so much overlap. \n\nAs I am writing this it’s dawning on me that Spanish is the obvious choice, but wonder how it’s worked for others or whether there is data/studies on this. \n\nThanks for any advice.",

I came to Taiwan to study Chinese but I just started it 4 months ago. We both speak in English together without any problem. Recently she is getting really really interested into learning French and she wants me to teach her and I see this as an opportunity to teach each other’s language ( she doesn’t speak Chinese to me that much actually so she can start teach me too). \n\n\nWe are both into learning languages and we both speak more than one foreign language. \n\nSo first how can I start to teach her since she has no basis or any knowledge in French almost and make it fun / not boring ? And actually same question the other way, but the difference is that I have basis and can speak a bit of Chinese.",

I don't live in Ireland however, so this is unlikely to happen in the near(ish) future. I've come across this website [https://www.ranganna.com/en/course/gaeilge-gan-stro-beginners-level](https://www.ranganna.com/en/course/gaeilge-gan-stro-beginners-level) which seems to be pretty professionally done and claims to offer at least 100 hours of self-guided content for newcomers to the language. I have quite a lot of language learning experience with other languages (French, German, Latin), so I think I should be able to have some success even when working on my own. The cost of the program though is 45 Euros for a 3 month subscription. I'm very happy to pay this, provided that the course is worth the cost. Has anyone had experience with the website before? Would you recommend it? If not, why and are there any better resources for someone in my position?\n\nThanks!",

I like speaking both, the accent feels really comfortable for both. \n\nI honestly like Farsi a bit more, but not too much, mostly because of the poetic sound. And the grammar as I understand it is easier? \n\nBut I noticed more cognates between English and Russian and the vocabulary in my head just clicks well. I struggle with pronunciation of Russian more than Farsi, mostly because of the stacked consonants, but I think that just takes some practice. The intonation is also a bit unusual, but not drastically so, compared to English(at least how I see it). \n\nI also am planning on working at a college preparatory school- as a mathematics teacher but they like the staff hosting and having in-demand skills. And I'm pretty sure Russian is more desirable than Farsi? Could be wrong but I don't believe so. And with both I'd need to learn new scripts so that's not too major of a factor. \n\nI love Iranian culture but I also adore Kalmyk culture and it's on my bucket list to visit some day. \n\nI think right now I'm leaning towards learning Russian. But I'd like thoughts regardless, and hopefully you can bring to my attention anything I haven't considered yet. \n\nThank you;",

        "text": "The link between sports and languages is quite strong, not only because of sport is part of culture, but also because of the language itself. Let’s take English for example.\n\nIn the UK, the word “football” usually indicates “association football”, the most famous sport in the world.In Ireland, the same term can be used to indicate Gaelic football as well, which is a completely different sport.   \n In the USA, the word “football” is used to indicate “American football” while in Canada it indicates “Canadian football”, two versions of a sport that is generally called “gridiron football”. In both countries, “association football” is usually called “soccer”.  \n In Australia, the word “football” indicates “Australian rules football”, still another code, and in New Zealand it can often indicate “rugby football”. So many meanings for just one word, amazing, isn’t it?\n\nWhat about the other languages? The majority of European languages tend to call “association football” with names derived from “football”: in French it is “football”, in German it is Fußball, in Spanish it is fútbol etc.   \n One important exception is Italian: in Italy, the word “football” was originally used, but it was later replaced with the Italian “calcio”, a term derived from a traditional sport which was quite similar to modern football and was very popular in Florence. For this reason, it was called “calcio fiorentino”, that is: Florence football.Florence is the city where Italian language and culture had origin, so it was normal for Italian people that Florence should have chosen the name for the new sport.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\\#sport #languages #football #soccer #languagesandculture",

        "text": "*(repost slightly edited since my last one was removed. small addition in italics below. some questions were received on my last post which i will repost and answer as comments)*\n\n**TLDR: I did a Vietnamese language immersion course in Vietnam and spent a month in France practicing French and would like to share what I learned/give advice to anyone else interested in doing immersions to help with planning.**\n\nAs a fellow avid language learner, and after many years of trying to learn on my own cheaply (but obviously giving up and finally putting money towards my goals), I was able to do a 4-week language learning immersion course + 1 week travel in Vietnam (HCMC) and spent 4.5 weeks in France with my partner's family practicing French. I learned a lot from both experiences and would be happy to share advice with anyone looking to do something similar so you might get the most out of it too.\n\nRelevant background and summary of experiences:\n\nI am a native English speaker.\n\n\\- **VIETNAM**: **insecure A1 to solid A2** after my experience (100 class hours). I am a heritage speaker but stopped using it regularly past the age of 7, so my pronunciation is basically native and I have good instincts/foundation about grammar and vocab, but I had very little confidence in speaking because of lack of use and because I never learned it formally.\n\nMy in-country experience was **6 hours a day one-on-one tutoring, stayed with a homestay family**, never studied because my host family wanted to hang out with me all the time so I got lots of listening and speaking practice but honestly did not effectively learn more vocab (my biggest weakness). Lessons were easy for me because a lot of it was review, and I had no issues with reading or pronunciation, so it was mostly a vocab exercise and getting me back to being used to speaking the language and gaining confidence in using it. By the end, I was quite comfortable traveling around for a week and was able to communicate with hotel staff, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, etc. for essentials with little to no trouble.\n\nMy biggest lesson from this: I think being a B1/B2 level would have been better for an immersion program, because at A level, my time would have been better spent in the classroom drilling vocab. Due to lack of vocab, the conversations I had with my host family were very limited and it was very hard to actually learn anything just by speaking/listening. It would have been better to already know the words but now use them in context.\n\n**So if I could do this again,** I would wait until I was a B1/B2 level, and also try to really carve out time to study. *I think I would also pick a less intense schedule (maybe 4 hours a day) so that I had plenty of time for studying, resting, and socializing. 6 hours a day (with 2-hour lunch break) didn't leave me with much time, especially since I was struggling with sleeping.*\n\n\\- **FRANCE: shaky B1 to....shaky B1** XD. **I went to stay with my partner's family in France for 4.5 weeks** over the winter holidays, and his family and many friends don't speak English well enough to have a real conversation, so I got quite a bit of French speaking and listening practice.\n\nI had been learning online (Lingoda) for the previous year, having put in 260 hours and taking the B1 level classes before I went. After my experience, my best takeaways were basically just proving that I was able to spontaneously have conversations with native speakers (with plenty of accommodation and understanding on their part, which I am very grateful) and that all my studying was worth something. My main points of learning were learning words/phrases I already knew but in context/in a real-life way, and realizing that being in a real French environment was a far cry from having your French teacher's clear, simplified words piped directly into your ears via headphones. Also, being B1 level helped a LOT because I was able to have actual conversations and make connections with people, which I felt I couldn't really do in Vietnam. Bonuses: I also read my first book in French while I was there, and had my first experience speaking to shopkeepers.\n\nHowever, because this was also a personal trip for us, I really struggled with the feeling of not wanting to be in the way of people catching up, not wanting non-teachers to have to accommodate to me, not wanting to burden the trip in any way, etc. so I was often stressed and shy and did not end up speaking as much as I could have. This might have been mostly in my head, but for the sake of language learning, it would have been better to be in an environment where everyone I'm talking to knows I'm a learner and can accommodate and encourage me.\n\n**So if I could do this again,** I would prefer to take a proper course with a school so learning can be a focus of my trip, but try to integrate socializing with normal French people.",

        "text": "First of all, I want to make clear that I admire those who speak many languages and I would really love to speak way more than two. All I want for this post is to serve as a rant about my own way to approach this topic and also hope to get some advice from others. Without further explanation to do, let's begin with my whining:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst I'm going to give some context by explaining my early approaches with learning languages, so bear with me. I will use bold font to mark the end of that \"section\" for those who aren't interested in knowing that and just want to get to the point.\n\nThe idea of learning new languages always caught my attention. Since I was a kid I used to ask my mother how to say certain words in English, and she would answer with the little knowledge that she had about the language. After I got my first computer and started browsing the web, I came across many flash games that were only in English, and as a Cartoon Network fan, it was a matter of time until I came to the American version of the site, too, which had some games that weren't in Spanish and I always felt frustrated because I couldn't read the instructions of those games (most of them didn't require instructions to be understood, but I always wanted to be able to read them anyway out of curiosity).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of this curiosity, when I was a kid my parents took me to an English institute when I was about 6, but I asked them to take me out of it since we were spending too much time in a vegetable spot in order to acquire, well, vegetable vocabulary, I guess? And I used to find that really boring. I was just a child by then, and little I knew that I would regret my decision years after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, when I started going to high school (that's at the age of 13 here in Argentina), a friend of mine showed me the band that became and still is my favourite one: Foo Fighters. I started translating the lyrics to Spanish, and also reading about the band on the internet. During that time, English Wikipedia became really important to me because the amount and quality of the content is hundreds of times better than the Spanish version. That's how I started learning English, and boy, I did struggle a lot to learn some concepts, especially in terms of pronunciation and listening, that made the trip of learning the language such a longer trip that it really needed to be.\n\n**End of my boring life story.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, learning English all on my own gave me the sense that I loved learning new languages. You know, when you get information that otherwise would be out of reach to you, or at least much more difficult to get to. Not only because of Wikipedia, the whole web is more complete and accurate in English that it is in Spanish. Also, those little improvements that I was able to incorporate to my pronunciation, when I started to listen to YouTube content in English with the subtitles off, and if I needed to turn them on, then just putting them in English. Being able to communicate in websites like Interpals and make friends there… I struggled and it really took me so long because I did it on my own, but I also enjoyed many things of this process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat made me decide that I wanted to learn other languages. And I tried. I tried many times, and really hard. I tried with German, Japanese and Turkish, to a lesser extent with Portuguese, and now I'm trying to learn French. But every time I end up asking myself the question of the title. What's the point?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can love a few bands or songs in German, Turkish or French. I can enjoy the sound of Japanese and Portuguese. But at the end of the day, I feel like I'm putting a lot of effort on doing something useless. What's the point on learning French if I don't have any French friend, and if I make one online we'd end up speaking the lingua franca instead of French or Spanish because that would spoil the flow of the conversation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when it comes to information or content, it's more or less the same. Being able to understand English makes switching to other languages feel as if you've been eating sushi and now you have to eat poop. And that also applies to Spanish. I almost don't search for anything in Spanish on the web unless it's a few Spanish speaking YouTubers or the local news. But also, how many good series or films are there in French, Portuguese, German, etc.? I know there are surely lots of them, but let's be honest, finding content that is both good and interesting to you in any language that is not English is always more difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love to learn languages, I really do. I love the process of learning something new, to learn new grammar, sounds, to understand things in their original language, to discover new ways to describe the world around me, but when I reach the point in which I don't know how to put all these things into practice, I feel frustrated and I quit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd really love to learn about your points of view regarding this topic and if you have experienced these emotions, and if so, how did you overcome them? What strategies did you use to find more content and people to interact in the languages that you were learning? What's the current use that you give to those languages, and if your native tongue isn't English, with that one, too (aside obviously, in the outside world)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for bearing with me during this whole rant. Cheers, and take care! I'll be reading you!",

        "text": "Okay, so this is probably going to be super ramble-y and I apologize in advance. \n\nI'm a native English speaker; and I was a B2 (I think? I could read and understand, like, 90% of things but I've always had auditory comprehension issues.) in Spanish, but I'm probably not at that level anymore because I haven't had to speak Spanish in 2+ years. I'm currently taking a German class and an ASL class. I've dabbled in a few other languages (e.g. Latin, Portuguese, French, etc.) for one reason or another, but never actually tried to learn them. \n\nMy problem arises that I'm taking both German and ASL already; my friend wants help with French, so I'd essentially be learning with her; I wanted to start practicing Spanish again so I don't 100% lose that ability; then my brother wants to learn Japanese, but he needs someone to learn with him and help him focus; and, for the cherry on top, I have a different friend who's a non-native English speaker and I think is feeling super overwhelmed by all of it, and I was planning to learn a few words/phrases of Mandarin Chinese (her native language) in my free time, but I'm not sure that's going to be a possibility anymore.\n\nSo that brings me to German, ASL, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. I'm not sure it's feasible to actually study that many languages at once and actually retain anything, but on the off chance it is, does anyone have any advice?",

        "text": "I wanted to create a challenge to learn 3 vastly different languages. Some criteria I came up with (but feel free to not follow them 100%):\n\n1. There are decent resources and presence online (e.g., online tutors, videos, movies, podcasts, music, context/sentence dictionary -- not just individual words, comprehensible input, etc.). \n2. They all must come from different language families\n3. They must not have strong English influence, especially in colloquial speech. So unfortunately this rules languages like Hindi, Tagalog, etc.\n4. They must not have loanwords influence with one another, e.g., choosing Korean probably rules out languages with strong Chinese loanwords, e.g., Vietnamese, Japanese, Mandarin, etc. Similarly languages with a lot of Arabic loanwords.\n5. They may or may not have different \"default\" word orders, e.g., SVO, SOV, and VSO.\n6. They may or may not have different scripts\n\nI was thinking:\n\n1. Modern Standard Arabic\n2. Japanese\n3. Hungarian\n\nAre there more difficult combinations? Please make sure at least the languages have decent online resources, because otherwise I'd just pick something like Greenlandic, Navajo, and Cree",

        "text": "Hello. I’m a native English speaker looking for tips on where to begin my language learning journey. My goal is to become a polyglot. I would like advanced proficiency in four languages outside of my native tongue. The issue I’m having is how to even begin. I’ve never tried to learn outside of an academic setting and I’ve been removed from that experience for several years already. In the past, I’ve done well enough with learning basic vocabulary and simple grammar in a classroom setting which is why I have considered taking intro courses at my local community college. Tips for self teaching, acquiring study resources and structuring a learning plan would be helpful. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks. 🫶\n\n\nAdditional information:\n- TLs include Arabic, Italian, German and Turkish (I’m open to others but these are priority for me) \n- TLs are all new to me \n- I have close friends that are native  speakers of two my TLs\n- I would like to learn more than one language at a time. (I don’t think this will be a problem since none of my TLs are not closely related)\n- I took Spanish in secondary school, and still have a basic understanding,  but chose not to pursue it in university\n- Other languages of interest include French, Serbo-Croatian, Portuguese, Korean and Farsi",
