I offer this as[ access to my life force](https://www.patreon.com/mindfulnessofdoom). ¬†Use it to tell me of the many ways in which this blog need be populated by more frequent and numerous postings.   \n\n\nSome months back, eons in podcast time, I was blessed with a rather gracious honor. ¬†An email appeared in my inbox. That alone is a blessing indeed. The contents of this email however, were astonishing: ¬†it described a board meeting in some high crystal tower. Men and women of means were discussing how to spread the joy and abundance of literacy to human cherubs who had not yet had the pleasure. ¬†Their noble task: to assist parents and teachers in the spread of the As, Bs, and even the Cs. We are all born savages. Civilization must be taught. These Bodhisattva‚Äôs of education are attempting to rid human society of illiteracy. ¬†Then came the shock of the year. That illustrious group was requesting our help.   \nTheir need was simple. ¬†A voice was needed to communicate their message. ¬†One that could record, edit, and perform their[ siren song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSUIQgEVDM4&amp;feature=youtu.be). ¬†Yes. ¬†It happened. ¬†Mindfulness of Doom was heard by all ears in that boardroom. ¬†We had a woman on the inside, you might say. The Doom-signal was lit, and shined across the sky. ¬†Help was needed. And I answered the call. Now I can add voice actor to the list of odd jobs on my resume. ¬†¬†\n\n[The Fates](https://youtu.be/QD1Jz5fJrfA?t=45)¬†had seen fit to place one of our listeners in that boardroom. ¬†One by the name of Christina. I have had the pleasure of making her acquaintance and I must say, she is a singular individual. ¬†She is a paragon of human decency and grace. On more than one occasion she has blown my mind by sharing a vulnerability with such honesty and openness that I found myself still thinking about it a week after. ¬†Where most people hide behind walls of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù, she showed something closer to humanity than your average homo-sapien (at least on the occasions that I was paying attention). She reminded me that vulnerability is synonymous with strength. ¬†We all know the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù‚Äôs of the world are necessary to get through the day. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to just endure. Other times, it‚Äôs good to let down the walls and be human. Of course I don‚Äôt envy anyone their pain, and we all struggle in one way or another, but I do admire the way she handles hers. ¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\nCorydharma\n\n\\~[My Spoon Is too Big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuOvqeABHvQ) ",

Some are bored and want something to do.\"\n\nIt seems too repetitive, to me. I've been thinking about it too much, and at this point, it's having a kind of semantic satiation effect on my brain and making it difficult to analyze objectively. So I'm wondering if anyone else has a good solution to eliminating the repeition (or, if you think it's fine the way it is, definitely let me know). Right now, I'm contemplating changing it to something like this: \"Some like to come out to hang with the crowd. Others like to check out the room and explore a new place. The free food beguiles many, while plenty like to use the atmosphere as escapism. And a few are bored and want something to do.\" But again, is this a necessary change, or am I just overthinking it?

        "text": "Hello there!\n\nIn an essay of mine, I wrote about a person's life. I wanted to express the idea of \"late childhood, early teenage\" so I wrote \"As he drifted into teenage,...\". However, a native speaker told me on the second read that it's better to say \"drifted into his teens\". \n\nI would like to verify their correction, and, if possible, know why one expression is better than the other. That is, is there a certain rule?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I've read some article that described these levels very, very odd:\n\n* fairly high, \n* high, \n* medium, \n* low, \n* fairly low\n\nSo their range is from very understandable (*fairly* high understandability) to very  incomprehensible (*fairly* low understandability).\n\nNow I have several issues with this, but I don't know if I perceive this correctly (English is not my native language). Firstly, isn't \"high\" better than \"fairly high\"? Shouldn't that be reversed? Since definition of fairly is \"to a moderately high degree\". Furthermore, is that classification even reasonable? Are those the levels of understandability? I'd rather go with something from \"very easy to understand\" to \"very difficult to understand\", and ditch the understandability term entirely. It seems more straightforward, intuitive. \n\nThanks for any kind of feedback! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",
