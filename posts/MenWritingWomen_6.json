        "text": "Fantasy is particularly bad about this, but anything that is \"old fashioned\" or \"historical\" just seems to go whole hog with rape everywhere, usually alongside casually marrying women off against their will to die in childbirth. Game of Thrones, for example, uses rape so much that it's desensitizing, while the Sword of Truth series got so gratuitously graphic I had to stop reading it (it was a welcome put down, that series has some quietly weird views of women).\n\nEven in historical fiction, a lot of male writers seem to linger on things like subservient women and female roles, or else women are relegated to background characters. That may be historically accurate, but it's pretty offputting to read. For example, I'm re-reading Sarum - which I loved as a young adult - and it's a hard read. The writer literally writes about a 13 year old bride for a celtic king. He describes her as high-breasted, slender, strong fertile hips, quiet and then elaborates on how many children her mother and grandmother had. THAT is her characterization and when she died in childbirth, the main character literally says \"Nobody cared.\" Hitting my 30s and looking back, I can identify that reading books upon books with similar treatments of women - including stuff like Hemmingway in HS Lit - really did have an impact on how I viewed myself.\n\nThese depictions don't really come across as trying to make a deep point or comment on the role of women. It's feels like it's just scene setting and conflict building - GRRM, for example, often tosses in rape to really hammer home that stuff was brutal (and the TV show added even MORE), while fantasy authors often default to a patriarchial culture where women wear dresses and heal and nuture and get preggers and maybe one or two women get a knife and get to be \"not like the others\" which then means she's usually compared against \"typical\" women to display her worth, usually through being non-feminine.\n\nI get that this stuff happens RL, but I feel like a good writer could convey high stakes without having raped or powerless women all over.  A good writer could illustrate the past without lingering overlong on the ugly parts of it (or highlight them through strong women, the Sally Lockheart books come to mind).\n\nA lot of the time it feels like male writers turn to rape as the PLUS ULTRA of bad shit and it's lazy. It seems like the default cultures of the imagination are still oppressive towards women. It's tiring.\n\n/rant\n\nWith that said, anyone got any good books with a strong role for women across the board? I would love a nice escapist fantasy read where women are the same as men in that society. \n\nEdit: Thanks for all the suggestions, I've got a great reading list now! ",
