        "text": "Sorry for my grammar\n\nThis happened yesterday at a grocery store with my mom. I was watching over the cart while she went to look for item. While she is looking for them, I just stood by the cart looking at the other stuff to see if I could find it too. \n\nI then a tug on the cart and I turned to see an older lady (40-50) trying to pull the cart away. I was thinking she need something that the cart was blocking, so I move the cart. That wasn't the issue though, once I moved it she went to me and asked for my cart. \n\nOL: \"Can I have your cart, since you're not using it.\"\n\nMe: *looks in cart and sees a bunch of stuff in it* \"No you can't have the cart, my mom is using it.\"\n\nOL: \"I just need to borrow it and there aren't any more carts at the front.\"\n\nWe are close to the entrance and I could see some carts for her. I figure since the lady had a basket on her, she was getting a few things and either the few things turned into more or she got tired of holding the basket. I just told there are carts at the front and she left, but not before bothering a stocker and asking if he could get the cart for her. \n\nHe just shooed her away and she went to the front annoyed. He looked at me then and asked if the lady was bugging me? I just said the lady wanted my cart, since I wasn't using it. He looked at the cart and said yes, I can tell you aren't using it. \n\nSince also it was new years eve, all the registers were open. I hear behind me that lady's voice how there should more registers and everyone should hurry the hell up. Everyone kind of turned into her direction and gave her a look. After we left I wished I told her \"Yes lets make the employees make a register appear out of nowhere.\"",

        "text": "Background: So I bought a gaming laptop (not economical, but it fit my needs) before I started college, and was pretty abusive to its hard drive.  It was failing shortly after the warranty period ended, which was a year-long warranty, but I wasn't peeved about this.  I did decide to send it to the manufacturer to replace it rather than a local shop because of problems I'd had with OS re-installs in the past.  I had to pay out of pocket for the shipping and the work, and I was fine with this.  This was reasonable.  This is not that story.\n\nI got it back, and the hard drive had not been properly installed.  This was unfortunate, but it wasn't the end of the world, and this sort of thing happens.  This is not that story.\n\nI called up the company and they said they would fix it for free.  It was the week before our Thanksgiving break though, and being at college I was hoping to either have it back before break, or shipped home, since I was getting my ride.  This is that story.\n\nI was calling them the Friday before the last week of class when they said they would fix it for free.  I asked if it would be possible for them to pay for 1-day shipping both ways.  They said that it would be **no problem.**  They said that the work would take up to two-days, so I figured I would ship it out in time for it to go on Friday, it would arrive on Monday, a day to process, start work on Tuesday, it ships on Thursday, I get it on Friday and can plan to leave on Saturday.  The guy at the call center told me that I'd definitely be getting it back on Friday at the latest if I shipped it out that day, and so I went to the trouble of getting to a shipping center before it closed and shipped it out with their label.\n\nOn Monday I got an email from the company saying that it had arrived.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon I got a tracking number for its return.  I checked it just to be sure and it indicated that it was shipping standard, rather than overnight.  It was outside of regular business hours, but this computer company is big enough to have extended support, and I figured it was going to be **no problem** to get my shipping fixed, but I was a little bit irked at this point, given that I shouldn't have had to send the laptop in the first place, and because of that I wasn't hoping to have to jump through hoops for this, but mistakes happen.\n\nI was on the phone from 5 PM to 1 AM with a number of different people that night.  The details are a bit foggy, but after a lot of time on hold being transferred, the representatives eventually concluded that the person who had the authority to do this wasn't on their extended support team.  I was given a ticket number and told I could handle it in the morning by getting directly up the chain of command.  I was beginning to be upset that I had spent so much of my time fixing what indeed had become more than **no problem** at that point, and that an issue so simple as the shipping priority of a package was beyond the privileges of anyone on extended support, and I was tired, but I figured I would call in the morning and the problem would be solved.\n\nThursday I got done with my morning class and called with my ticket number ready.  I convinced the people to just shoot me to the top and talked to the absolute biggest piece of shit ever (BPSE from here on).  I'm sure he deals with shitty customers that are just fed up with other representatives, but this **no problem.**  \n\nI had checked the tracking number, and it had not arrived at the shipping company's center yet (anonymizing them too).  BPSE told me, however, that there was no possible way that they could change the shipping status of something that had already gone out, and after a bit of me arguing that this seemed incredulous for a company of their size, we were at an impasse, so the call was done.  I was pretty upset that they had shit the fan on sending my package to me and I was shit out of luck.  But I still didn't really believe him.  I called the shipping company and asked them if it was possible to change the package's shipping status for this company.  They told me that the company had to be the one to do it (obviously) but it could still be overnighted.\n\nI was ecstatic that I was going to be able to solve this, so I called back up and got back on the line with BPSE after some serious hold time and told him that I had called, and I knew he could do this, and it was unfortunate that he was *mistaken* earlier, but I'm sure it would be **no problem** to now FINALLY fix this.\n\nBPSE told me that this wasn't customer support territory, and doing this would actually be the repairs department in the company.  I told him that was fine, and I could wait while he called over to repairs to solve this.  He told me he would be unable to do that, despite the endless hours I had already spent on hold.  I told BPSE that I'd be willing to do a three-way call with him and the repairs department then.  BPSE told me this would not be possible.  I offered to let BPSE call me back, and BPSE still maintained that this would not be a thing that he could do.  He told me that it would be a **problem** because he did not have any means of contacting the repairs department.\n\nI began to crack.\n\nI told him I would call them.  \n\nHe told me that there was no way to get ahold of them.  I told him I could wait while he found their number.  He told me that no one had their number.  I told him I could go on with someone higher up that had their number.  He told me there was no one higher up.\n\nI cracked.\n\nI asked BPSE if they lived in an underground facility where they were not allowed to contact anyone else on earth, and how it was possible that he could not get ahold of someone within the same damn company.  He told me that he couldn't, and he told me to calm down.  At this point, I had wasted the majority of a 24 hour period on a shipping issue that never should have happened so that I wouldn't inconvenience the people in MY life, on a tech support issue that was THEIR fault to begin with.\n\nI stole this line from someone else, but my exact words I vividly remember shouting in an empty classroom as a professor walked by.\n&gt; Humanity has managed to put a goddamned man on the moon, but you can't manage to do your fucking job and fix a fucking shipping issue on a computer.  You are a waste of the grand fucking potential imbued into every human being, you worthless piece of shit.\n\nAnd I hung up the phone.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, I was calmed down enough that a way to actually solve my problem occurred to me.  I reverse white page'd the address that I had shipped my computer off to six days prior.  I unbelievably came up with a phone number and called it.  The receptionist who immediately answered was able to modify the shipping to overnight **no problem** in a five minute phone call.  I repeatedly thanked her and told her how many times more useful than she'd been than the people at customer support.  I got my package the next day, no thanks to anyone but her.",

Right?\nNot quite. \n\nWhen I received the first order, the PSU and Motherboard were defective. They don't allow cross shipping, so I ordered another powersupply and motherboard. Upon attempting to return the defective ones, they denied my RMA due to the serial number being wrong on the Power Supply Box. Not the item, JUST THE BOX. They want the empty box from Order #2 to RMA Order #1.\n\nHere is the chat that ensued:\n\nnomchompski: And I'd like to be clear\n\nnomchompski: you are asking for just the box?\n\nnomchompski: an empty box?\n\nnomchompski: there are no accessories, it is just... an empty box.\n\nHelpful CSR: Yes, please allow 3-5 business days for the credit to be processed and returned to your original method of payment.

        "text": "Relevant backstory: I grew up in a major city in the North East but moved to the South in 2011.  My mom died in 2007, when I was 27 years old.  She owned a very successful business and I, an only child, inherited a not insubstantial amount of money.  With this inheritance, in 2013, I purchased a farm (I love animals and having a farm has always been a dream of mine). There was a house on the property, and while it was well maintained and in good condition, it was at least 30 years old and had the most horrible floor plan and ugliest facade imaginable.  Instead of trying to renovate and update it, which would have been a massive undertaking, I decided to build a new house.  I ended up hiring someone that I was friendly with as a contractor.            \n\nSo, contractor and I finalize all of the details and he draws up a contract.  We go to a nearby branch of a major US bank to get the contract notarized.  I've gotten things notarized many times before and I typically view the whole process as a mere formality.  I've always gotten the feeling that the notaries do as well.  \n\nBut not this particular notary.  She was a lady in her 60s and had the look of a school teacher from the 1950's that would slap kids on the hand with a ruler - on the plump side, black hair up in a hairspray-ed bun, silk blouse, glasses with a chain attached to hold them around her neck.  From the moment we stepped into her office, she most certainly did not give off a friendly or warm and fuzzy vibe.\n\nSo contractor and I sit down, expecting the usual routine - notary checks our IDs, watches us sign and then stamps the contract.  Well, this notary took her job very seriously, because clearly her job is very, very important.  She starts reading through our contract, and we're sitting there in silence as she flips through the pages.  She asks us if we understand what we are signing (my contractor and I are both very clearly adults that can read and know enough to get a contract notarized).  She continues flipping pages. She's taking this whole notary thing way too seriously and is being quite condescending. \n\nThen she looks at me and says, \"Who owns this property?\"\n\n\"I do,\" I said.\n\n\"Just you?  Are you married?\"  Her tone was dripping with what could only be described as disgust.\n\nAt the time of this story I was 34 and single. It took me a few moments to understand what she was getting at, but eventually it clicked in my head that this notary could not fathom that a youngish woman could possibly own a property on her own and be - GASP - building a house for herself.  Although she did not come right out and say it, it was pretty clear that she was offended by my existence as a young, unwed, female property owner.  Her's was an incredibly antiquated mindset that I had previously never encountered in real life. \n\nWhen I figured this out, I decided that I had had it with her and started to get snippy.  Not only had she dragged this notarizing process on, but she was taking to us like we were idiots and was now treating me like I should have a big, red \"A\" sown on the front of my shirt.  The North Easterner in me came out and I said something along the lines of, \"Look, we just need to get this notarized.  I've gotten things notarized many times and it's not a big deal.  We don't need you to read through the contract, just let us sign it and then stamp it.\"  Notary lady did not take too kindly to being spoken to harshly by a harlot such as myself.\n\nMy poor contractor, who is an incredibly nice, cheerful and laid-back person is just sitting there kind of shocked by her rudeness and my getting confrontational and putting this woman in her place. \n\nSo what does the judgmental notary do?  She takes the pen that's in her hand and THROWS it across the desk at me - not at my face but downward so it hits contract on the desk in front of me with some force.\n\nSo we sign and she stamps and we walk out of the bank.  I felt a little bad for semi-yelling at the notary in front of my contractor, as I thought I might have embarrassed him.  But we discussed it and he agreed that she had been rude and intrusive and I think he got a kick out of my shutting her down.\n\nAnd he ended up building me a kick ass house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I didn't have a pediatrician picked out before my son was born. I did make a half-hearted effort to find one, but then I went into labor a week early and ended up having an emergency c-section, (and to be perfectly honest I probably wouldn't have gotten around to it before his due date anyway,) and when I was given the okay to go home we still didn't have a pediatrician.\n\n\"Do you have a pediatrician?\" was one of the discharge questions, and when I said no, the pediatrician who had examined my son after he was born offered to keep seeing him at the clinic he practiced at when he wasn't at the hospital. I said sure, and he scheduled my son's first checkup for five days out.\n\nThen he remembered that he didn't have that day available due to the Thanksgiving holiday, apologized, and scheduled us with one of his colleagues for two days out. She'll henceforth be known as Dr. B.\n\nThree guesses what the B stands for.\n\nA quick note on my mental state at the time of that appointment- I'd just had emergency surgery. I'd been prescribed pain medication, and had immediately stopped taking it because it made me so nauseous I couldn't even keep water down. Instead, I was taking Ibuprofen. And I had a newborn, so I was sleep deprived as hell. I was not in the mood to be fucked with. \n\nMy son and his car seat together were over the limit for what I was allowed to lift during my recovery, so my father, who had come from out of state to meet his first grandchild, drove us to the appointment and carried him in for me.\n\nImmediately after he was born, my son had had a lot of medical professionals worried about him because his temperature was 97.7. I *wasn't* worried, because *my* temperature is usually right about 97.5. By the second day there they'd failed to find anything wrong with him, and they'd decided that, yes, he was just abnormally cold, just like his mother, and he was cleared to leave whenever I was. \n\nThe first thing Dr. B did after examining him was start talking about re-admitting him because of his temperature. I gave her the whole story about how *I'm* abnormally cold, they'd determined *he* was just abnormally cold, and the hospital sent him home knowing what his temperature was. She pulled up his charts from the hospital, acknowledged that they'd noted the temperature but hadn't found anything wrong with him, and immediately changed gears to talking about his weight.\n\nNow, the whole time that I was in the hospital, I had various nurses and lactation consultants (people who help first-time mothers learn how to breastfeed) telling me that his weight was good and that we were doing fine. He was eating well, I was producing milk, everything was great. (For those of you who don't know, it's common for babies to lose weight after birth. As long as they gain it back quickly, it's not a problem. By the time we were discharged, he'd begun to gain weight.) \n\nDr. B said that he was still down 4% of his birth weight. She went on to say that anything under 10% is fine, *HOWEVER,* the *combination* of low body temperature *and* weight loss meant he might need to be readmitted, and I needed to have him weighted again two days from now to know for sure.\n\nShe went on to say that I couldn't have him weighted *here* because the clinic would be closed for the holiday, so I was going to have to go to a *separate* clinic which specialized in breastfeeding and would let me use their scale, and while I was there I could go ahead and meet with a lactation consultant. In fact, she'd call and schedule me a consultation.\n\nI told her thank you, but that that wouldn't be necessary as I'd already seen the hospital's lactation consultant.\n\nShe replied that this clinic would be happy to see me anyway.\n\nI told her that I *didn't need to* see a lactation consultant.\n\nShe told me that they could help with breastfeeding. \n\nI said that I wasn't having trouble breastfeeding.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"you may want to meet with one for when you *do* have trouble.\"\n\nSince the place she wanted me to go to was all the way across town, and the *day* she wanted me to go was Thanksgiving, and I was pretty sure she was only pushing me to go because she'd decided I was failing miserably at breastfeeding, I asked if I could just weigh him at home and report back.\n\nNo, I had to use a medical scale or I might get an inaccurate number and then she'd have to have him readmitted. I didn't want him to be readmitted, right? \n\nOhkaaaaaay then, lady. Give me the stupid brochure for the boob people and I'll haul my post-operative ass over there on turkey day and ask to borrow their scale. Jesus. \n\nWe exchanged the usual goodbye pleasantries of two people pretending not to feel utter disdain for one another, and on the way out the door she looked at my balding, silver-haired father, the *grand*father of her patient, and asked, \"and is this the father?\"\n\nAfter a moment of awkward silence, he pointed to me and said, \"father of this one.\" \n\nI'm in my 20's, and I look younger than I am. The baby's *actual* father, my husband, was home asleep because he worked nights. The revelation that she'd assumed I'd had a baby with my sugardaddy *did* go a long way towards explaining why she was so hostile and dismissive with me, but it also pissed me off even more. \n\nSo I went and had my son weighted (and discovered he was now above his birth weight and therefor *completely fucking fine, thanks*) and I did bring him back for his next appointment, but only because I was afraid she'd call CPS on me if I didn't. After that, I planned to call every pediatrics office in town until I found someone who would see my abnormally cold child. And the only reason I didn't was because the original pediatrician, the one from the hospital, was back the next week and we were able to see him. \n\nI gave him the paper from the lactation consultant certifying my son's weight gain. He thanked me, but advised me not to worry, because anything under 10% is fine. ",

We arrived at this store in one of the larger towns in the area by 3:45 and, while my buddy was searching for agar powder, I explained to the cashier our entire story. Her reaction sums it up perfectly: \n\n&gt;C: why the hell wouldn't you wait till morning and then drive here once the roads are salted?!\n\nAnyway, we got the agar powder and are cooking now\n\nTL;DR: I am an idiot who couldn't wait to go search for agar powder\n\nnot sure if this post was a great fit for this subreddit, if you have a better subreddit to post this on please tell me",

A pain in the butt, however, I can live with it. I had a game from there that I had not opened yet. I thought fine I will bring the game back and refund it then rebuy it with the gift card. That way I get my money, the gift card is gone and everyone is happy.   \nThe next day I walk in with the game and ask for a refund telling her I am going to rebuy it with the $6 gift card. So she returns the game and asks me for my gift card. thinking she was going to ring it in and let me purchase it using the card I hand it over. No, the moron adds another $6 to the gift card. then tells me the computer makes her add $6 to a gift card if a gift card was used. Since she was the one that rang through my original return she KNEW that I already honored the $6 gift card but no she put another $6 on for a total of $12 on the gift card. I was annoyed but bought the game and left swearing never to shop there again.     \nStupid me did not take my own advice. I got a $5 gift certificate from the shop and so I went across town to another location thinking they call cant be that stupid. The store was having a buy 2 games get 1 free sale on. So I grabbed 3 games and went up to pay the buy 2 get one free came to 41 with tax. I had $5 off so I should pay $36, nope they were charging me $41 why? because they took the $5 off the highest priced item which made it the lowest price item and then gave me that item free. So basically they were taking the $5 off the free item $0-$5=$0 in their books and they saw no problem at all with that.",

        "text": "I'll be honest, I'm partially posting because I want to know if I'm in the right for being annoyed about this, and for potentially taking my biz elsewhere. I'm hardly the \"customer is always right\" type - I'm actually pretty much the opposite and hate entitled customers. Anyway, I recently developed a random illness that is usually not a big deal for younger people my age, but can be serious if not treated or if you're older. The medication for it is also used to treat other issues, and here is where I suspect the confusion was. After my trip to the doctor (actually the physician's assistant treated me and submitted the prescription to my pharmacy), I began taking the medication, and was told by a friend in medicine that I should actually be taking a higher frequency dosage of the medication for my particular situation. This was after a day and a half of taking the wrong dosage frequency, so naturally I was a little annoyed. I called the PA at the office I went to the next day, got her asst. The asst put me on hold and then got back on, confirmed I should be taking the higher frequency dosage, and just said, \"I'm glad you called!\" I wasn't angry or snippy on the phone, just said, \"Ok, thanks!\" and continued taking the correct dosage. My RX ran out and I was told by the pharmacy I would have to wait a day before re-filling, so out of concern I called the PA and asked her if it would set me back to be off the meds for one day. As I introduced myself over the phone and explained the situation, the PA was so silent I almost wondered if she had hanged up. (And I get it, I work for a business and I am in charge of clients, so I know that feeling too, but I feel like this is a difft situation). She answered my question in a very short tone, and just said \"Ok, byyyyee\" in what I can only describe as the tone of a college student with a major attitude who is tired of her customer service rep job. Like I said previously, I get being annoyed by over-concerned customers. I have a handful of them right now. But given that they made a serious mistake on my RX order, maybe a little bit of a nicer tone (or heaven forbid an apology) was in order here? It may sound petty, but based on this, I am considering visiting a new office for my follow-up.",

Rep told me they only deal with mobile, in spite of me having been transferred to them after explicitly specifying I was calling in regards to a landline. Transferred to 3 (where an automated message said the waiting time would be 1 hour and took my info to call me back then).\n\n3 - Called back after waiting. Explained situation and needs.

I was skeptical so I spelled everything out very explicitly and got confirmation that he understood and what he was saying was correct, more than once before hanging up the phone. Shortly after getting off the phone I checked and immediately verify that what he said doesn't work.\n\n4 - Called a different number from the website that was also supposed to be for business (due to getting repeatedly transferred after calling the other number). Explained situation and needs. Rep told me they were not the right department for what I was asking (of course) but they will investigate the issue for me anyways.

They transferred me to 7.\n\n7 - This was just an automated menu that repeatedly stated a \"for service in English, press 1\" prompt over and over no matter how many times I pressed 1.\n\n8 - Called the same business number I had called the last time. This time, miraculously they could apparently deal with business accounts for some reason. The rep asked me for a PIN. I was never asked this previously by any of the other reps I was discussing the account with but who had disclosed account info, made changes to the account and were prepared to sell services for the account.

This rep told me that, to his knowledge, the service in question actually does not work for my needs the way that 4 &amp; 5 explained to me. He stated he would confirm this and call me back in half an hour. He did not.\n\nEvery single time I spoke to someone new I had to give them my account information and callback number again.

Like, violently ill, consistently. Two or three times a month, I would call out of work, but after a couple months went by, I was starting to  feel the pressure to stop calling out. My supervisors would be passive aggressive with me every time I called in sick, so I stopped entirely.\n\nEventually, I got a cold. I was miserable, congested, and fatigued. The first few days were just me recovering, but three days into the ordeal, I had work. Too nervous to call out, I went in to work cashier.\n\n**Story:** On the way to work, I stopped by a gas station down the road. The convenience store next to it was a small business, family-owned, not a chain or anything. I had never been inside, I just needed something to drink to give me some energy.\n\nUpon entering, it was eerily quiet. There wasn't a single person around, customer or employee. I was a little confused by the lack of people, but I brushed it off and made a beeline for the drinks, stocked in a far corner of the store. \n\nAs I'm browsing, I hear the door next to me open, and a balding Indian man emerges. He can't be older than 50 or younger than 30. \n\nThe conversation goes as such (he will be IM):\n\n&gt;IM: Hi, how are you?\n\n&gt;Me: Good.\n\n&gt;IM: Can I help you find something?\n\n&gt;Me: No, I'm fine, thanks.\n\n&gt;IM: You're really sexy. How old are you?\n\nIt takes me a second to register this, as I assume it would take any other normal person. I am an 18-year-old, petite girl with a baby face, and I *do not* like confrontation. I am shocked/speechless. I have never been cat-called, but I am cornered between a wall, a food display, and this fridge, and something tells me this is far worse. \n\nWanting to get out of the situation as soon as humanly possible, I looked at him, wide-eyed and red in the face and say the first thing that comes to mind.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm 12. \n\nHe was silent through the whole transaction.

        "text": "Hello!\n\nI just want to share my bad customer service experience with a large online dating company that I will call Ass.com, so that other users don't make the same mistake I did and to show that this particular site, ass.com, doesn't really care about their customers insofar as their refund policies go.\n\nShort version: \n\n* forgot to cancel subscription, was charged again. \n\n* asked for a refund because I forgot to cancel and did not use the service (I wanted to cancel about 4-5 days after the charge came in).\n\n* customer service said they have a no refund policy, offered partial courtesy refund in exchange for 2/3rds of service already paid for. \n\n* this shows that ass.com does not care about their customers, just their money; beware when signing up with similar sites.\n\n* automatically cancel subscriptions, that way this situation does not happen to you guys.\n\nLong version:\nAbout 3 months ago I decided to give ass.com a try. I signed up for their 3 month package and started using the site. Work got busy and life got in the way (as it normally does) so I was not able to use the site much, and eventually I forgot I even had a subscription. 3 months later I was charged again by the auto renewal system.\nI called their customer support to ask for a refund 4-5 days later (I did so as soon as I found out but I don't check my credit card statement every day) and was told that they were sorry but that they do not issue refunds, and that they could provide me with a \"courtesy refund\" of 1/3rd of what I paid for and that if I took this refund that I would finish the month of service but that the rest would be cut off. I asked to speak with a higher level of support and they told me that their system forces them to chose this option and that they could do nothing else for me. I later contacted their support through twitter since social media support tends to be better overall, but they basically told me the same thing. Essentially, go pound sand, you are a fool for thinking we would care.\n\nWhat does this show? It shows that ass.com does not really care about their customers as far as their policies are concerned, and that they have a short sighted view of customer service. I did not want to cancel because I dislike their service or whatever (I didn't even get to use it much), I just wanted to cancel it because I did not use it and wanted a refund for accidentally forgetting to cancel my subscription (something that I have done on other occasions with other companies, who are usually extremely accommodating). I may even have signed on in the future and used it again, but now that I have had this experience I do not think I will be doing so since I don't want to work with companies who do not have customer friendly policies.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share my story with the reddit community so that it may serve as a warning. When signing up to these sites I would advice to immediately cancel your subscription so that it doesn't auto renew. That way if you don't like them you can just forget about it, and if you do you can simply sign on and renew it since you would be logging on to use the service anyways. I would also encourage people to be very careful when signing up for services such as these, you may be out of luck if you need help from them. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you need any other advice from me!\n\nCheers!",

The line didn't seem to move as quickly as it usually does, even during busy times. As I was waiting, I started seeing people trying to open the door to walk inside and all the doors were locked. Some people walked away, and other would bang on the door until an employee came to open it and let them inside. I thought that was weird? Why would they have the doors locked? Turns out, they were understaffed that night and I ended up waiting 45 minutes in line to get food. I would have left and gone somewhere else, but I got to a point where there was no room to leave the line even if I wanted to. I would like to know if they are actually able to lock the doors during open hours for that reason?",

        "text": "For my wife's biz, recently ordered her a new laptop from a major manufacturer. Happened to get it on sale for Cyber Monday, via their website. My first mistake. They tell me ship date of 12/8. I ordered with standard shipping (1 week). My second mistake. \n\n12/8 comes, they send me a note: \"Oh due to the holidays we need to bump your order a week\". New date of 12/16, but they state they are upgrading me to express shipping. Their first lie. Yet their website shows nothing changed. \n\nSo I call back. Tier 1 is typical tier 1 reading off a script, \"Oh you will have it for Christmas, no worries\". I correct them to inform them this is not a Christmas order, just a routine business order. Get it escalated to a Tier 2 agent who finally shows some understanding. Explain its marked with the shipped that once its released from customs (its built out of my country), will be 2 day shipping. Second lie. \n\n12/16. It actually does ship. Or at least the shipper gets shipping details, sends me a tracking number and says they take ownership of the item. Over the weekend (12/17 and 18) it changes \"status\" or \"location\" a few times to trigger an update on the shipper but does not change geographic location (same city/country). Shipper has no assigned receive date for me due to \"international shipment\" which I assume is due to customs. Their order code is \"International Economy\" which I assume is standard, not expedited shipping. \n\nMind you, this whole time, the manufacturer still shows no updates on their side since the ship date change of 12/16. They send me an email on 12/18 stating a date of 12/20 for receiving the delivery. Another lie. \n\n12/18. I get an email for a delivery change to 12/23 by the manufacturer. Still \"indeterminate\" by the shipper. And remember, it still has not left the geographic location at all. Tier 1: \"Oh well we are having IT problems, so our website is not updating.\" I get a Tier 2 person to confirm via email that its set for expedited shipping again. \n\n12/19. I get another \"location update\" from the shipper. Still has not left the geographic location. Manufacturer Tier 2: \"Shipper website we've been notified is having issues. We show the package in the US in customs\". Last lie. Note, tier 1 (previous day) and tier 2 have no communications with each other. I call the difference in IT issues out. No response. Fine. I give them an ultimatum. Either its on my doorstep Wednesday, being its upgraded to overnight delivery, if its really in customs should be easy, or cancel the order. \"Oh well I dont know if we can do that\". Well you expedited it, why cant you overnight it. You evidently dont want the order. \"Well lets see if it gets there Wednesday and if not we can look at options\".\n\nI get off this, call the shipper. \"We do not show the package in the US at all. We are not aware of any IT/website issues. We still show it at the origination location.\" Which I believe. Anytime Ive heard of tracking or website issues with this shipper (very big US/international shipper), its normally very public and visible on their behalf, much less external monitors/news/etc. \n\nSo Im done. (How many lies is this?) I tell the shipper to mark this return to sender, do not deliver. Get written confirmation from them. They also phone confirmation a few hours later.\n\nI call the manufacturer back. Tier 1: Can I get this order canceled? \"Oh no problem, whats the reason?\" Delayed reciept. \"Ok, and done. Be a few days to get payment refunded, typical bank processing etc.\"\n\nNote how easy Tier 1 can cancel, but Tier 2 can't.\n\nNow for the best. Which is a lot shorter. I call another major manufacturer of computers. Tier 1 hears this is for a small biz, immediately transfers me to an acct rep for small biz. I ask on their shipping policies and location from. Its US. Ok good. They ask on the order, end up getting specs, find me a very comparable enterprise model, for 100 dollars more than I was paying, with a better support/warrenty policy. Free shipping upgrade to 2-day, and should have it in hand within a week. Tell them to write it up for me, and send it via email to review. I look at it overnight, peruse their website, see they have the model on sale, plus have another model with better processor on sale as well even cheaper. I reply about this. They update the quote, knock 20 bucks off for not seeing this the first time (I know why, he went off my specs instead of looking around, my book its both good and bad). \n\nIt got ordered this morning. Ill update when I get it. ",

        "text": "Really enjoy reading this sub! I've been lurking for a while and felt it was time to post my customer story (after getting some confidence after reading a recent tale about a fake id). This happened last year when I was 23-years-old. I apologize if it's a little lengthy but it's one of my favorite stories to tell people! Included tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nAt the time of my story I lived in a big ol' college town in a big US city. I still live in this wonderful city but have since left the extremely college-y neighborhood for a nicer place with older folk like me (I am now 24). The college town has a few bars and, understandably, can get pretty strict when it comes to ID'ing customers because of how many underage kiddos there are. \n\nIt's important to note I have an out of state ID. I'm too lazy to change it to my current address because DMV and figure I would take care of it when my license expires. I have never had trouble with any bars in any other neighborhood in the entire city. And up until this fateful night, never had trouble with this bar in particular.\n\nSo I've been talking to a Tinder guy. Things are going well as we text and after a few days of this we decide to meet-face-to-face at the local bar in College Town. It's Friday night and pouring rain outside. I'm dressed nicely and Uber is surging-the-fuck-out, public transit is running hella late and the bar is a far walk.\n\nTinder Guy offers to pick me up. What a saint! He drives by my apartment in his nice car, I hope in, and we hit it off immediately as we share similar favorite car models. We get to the bar and it's only like 8:30 or something, too early for a bouncer to be checking IDs with the blacklight scanner or whatever it is. \n\nAt the bar, a young woman asks for our ID. Tinder Guy hands his off and having a license issued in this state, runs into no trouble. I hand off my ID. Bartender glances at it once and her face scrunches up. Idiot Bartender will be IB, I'll be GWR.\n\nIB: I'm sorry this is fake I can't accept it. *she does not hand my ID back to me*\n\nGWR: Oh, no it's real. Look at the hologram. IDs from this state have that specific hologram.\n\nAt the time I worked at a bar down the street. I knew the difference between real and fake for a couple of states but definitely my own. My ID doesn't break if you bend it, the picture is clear, all the shit it needs is there. And it's not like I'm from the other side of the country. IDs like mine are slightly common in this state. \n\nIB: It's fake.\n\nGWR: Uhm, okay. Do you want to test me on my address or zip code or name? I know all the info because it's real.\n\nIB: This is fake.\n\nGWR: I have several credit and debit cards with my name on them that match the ID as well as my college identification. This is a real ID issued by *state*.\n\nThis is shortened but we've been going at it for like 10 minutes. Tinder Guy is still by side and I am getting embarrassed.  This has literally never happened before and I'm going red in the face.\n\nIB: This is fake and I can only verify it with your birth certificate or your social security card. \n\nThis, is where I lose my cool. I am always hella nice and friendly to wait staff and retail. I was a bartender/server myself. I leave tips and I never raise Hell. I don't even correct wrong orders! But now I have had it.\n\nGWR: Yeah, let me pull those right out of my ass for you. Go get your manager. \n\n(The birth certificate was a stupid thing to ask but an SS card, maybe you're asking yourself why I don't carry it around in my wallet. Well in the case my wallet is stolen. Like I said, big city, and shit happens.)\n\nIdiot Bartender, my ID in hand, scampers to the back for the manager. I turn to Tinder Guy and I am visibly upset.\n\nGWR: I am so sorry you can leave if you'd like. We can reschedule for another day.\n\nLike a champ, he waved it off and waited with me saying it was not a problem at all. So we stand there, making small talk, sipping water, and several other bartenders ask us if we need anything. We explain the situation and every bartender looks as confused as us.\n\nTinder Guy and I were standing there for *fourty-five minutes*. I couldn't leave without my very real, very authentic ID. \n\nFinally, praise God, the dumb idiot bitch returns and hands me my ID and asks us what would we like to drink, all chipper and happy.\n\nI ask what the fuck was that all about.\n\nIt turns out, her and manager were *Googling* what a real ID from my state looks like! I was dumbfounded. Tinder Guy was dumbfounded. We paid full price for two beers. No comp, no apology from the bartender or the manager, no gift card or something, I don't know. We had been there for an hour before getting our first drink.\n\nWe stayed for one beer and left. After the night was over I blew up the company's Yelp page with negative reviews and emailed their corporate office several times to no response. Out of curiosity I went back to this bar like 3 more times, and Idiot Bartender was never there. I sincerely hope her ditzy ass was fired. \n\nAnd Tinder Guy? Is now my boyfriend. We've been happily dating for over a year and a half and have moved into our apartment together :) So at least some good came from that night. \n\n**tl;dr**: dumb bartender can't do her job and tell the difference between a real and fake ID. Proceeds to make my date and I wait an hour and offers no apology. \n\n**EDIT**: As a few people pointed out I confused \"IB\" and \"ID\" and committed one of The Great Reddit Sins :( Made the needed changes but I guess that's what happens when you abbreviate similar characters!

There wasn't a line or a designated place for a line to form so I simply stood off to the side and waited for the cashier to finish up with her customer.\n\nThe customer begins walking off so I approach the register when a woman darts right past me with her cart and heads right for the cashier. The cashier points out to her that I had been waiting and this seemed to irritate the woman a little bit. I brought my item to the counter and as the cashier rung it up, the same lady started placing her cans of pet food and whatnot on the counter right in front of me. This lady was practically shoving me out of the way and was able to see my PIN as I was putting it in!\n\nNow, the same thing happens at the clothing store I work at.

I do have some minor concerns about possible rough treatment of the grill while it was on the floor, but mainly I guess I'm offended at their dishonesty.  Frankly, if they had simply asked permission to send the floor model, I'd have probably have agreed, or just asked for a small discount.  I'm tempted to simply cancel my order as a fuck you for lying, but I do want that grill in time to smoke a Christmas turkey.  \n\nI'll probably just call back and tell them I want it new in box and assembled here, but if I went some other route, what action would you recommend? \n\nFollow up:  I decided honesty was the best policy so I called the store and asked to speak to the manager, and told her what I'd overheard, and asked for confirmation about the source of the grill.  She told me that they'd had one boxed in the back which they assembled that afternoon and were moving the floor model to another store.  It still sounds fishy as hell but she sounded sincere, so who knows.  As long as there's nothing visibly wrong with the grill they deliver I've decided to just give them the benefit of the doubt.  It's not as if I have any other definitive proof anyway.\n",

Please note dear LS, I am a cashier so I understand you can't always be there the full time. But your cashier thought she was special. I saw her not once but twice saunter from  her stand over to the returns desk and back as I was trying to get help. \n\nYour system is similar to the one I work with, and at one time I felt that it would be faster to go over and do it myself.

        "text": "I was binging on this sub last night and it reminded me of something that happened to me a few years ago. \n\nI'm a server and deal with cash regularly. I don't pay for much with a credit/debit card because I almost always have cash. This particular day, I went to a fast food place with my kids where you park in a stall and order food and they bring it to your car. My total came to something like $25. I had a $100 bill from working the night before and I needed it broken for something I had to do that day. I know the people who work there don't usually keep large amounts of cash on them, so when I ordered, I let them know I would be paying with a $100 bill. \n\nThis was around the time when the newer  $100 bills came out. I think it was 2012/13. And the $100 bill I had was from 1995. This is important. \n\nThe guy who brought my food was probably about 16 years old. I tried to hand him the money and this is what happened. (paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact conversation) \nK = kid bringing my food, M = me,  MA= manager\n\n\n&gt;K- That'll be $25.61\n\n&gt;M - (hands him money) \n\n&gt;K - Ummmmm, hold on. I have to take this inside. \n\nI was thinking maybe he just didn't have change for it. \n\nA few minutes later, he came back. \n\n&gt;K - I'm sorry ma'am. We can't take this. This is fake. \n\n&gt;M - Why do you think it's fake? \n\n&gt;K -There are no holograms on it. \n\n&gt;M - (internally rolling my eyes) I'm aware of that. It is from 1995. They didn't put holograms on money in 1995. But I assure you, it's real. \n\n&gt;K - We can't accept this. My manager said it's fake. \n\n&gt;M - (very nicely) Could you please ask your manager to come out here? \n\nManager comes out and he's probably 19/20. This is gonna be fun. /s\n\n&gt;MA - Ma'am, I'm sorry, I'm not sure where you got this, but this is not a real $100 bill. There are no anti counterfeit marks on it anywhere. \n\n&gt;M - Yes, there is. If you hold it up to the light, there is a strip running through it that denotes it as a $100 bill. There were no holograms on money in 1995.\n\n&gt;MA - I've never seen one that looks like this before. This is obviously fake. I'm obligated to keep this and I can't give you your food unless you have another way to pay. \n\n&gt;M - (getting angry) I understand that you are probably too young to have ever used a bill like this, but I can assure you that it's real. You are not keeping my money. I have some smaller bills I can pay with, but if you don't give me my money back, I'm calling the police. You can go google what $100 bills looked like in 1995. This is real money. And if your job requires handling money, you should really be familiar with things like this. \n\n&gt;MA - (stuttering) Well, um, I, Uh, I don't really know what to do here. I know I'm not supposed to give this back. \n\n&gt;M - Ok, then I'm calling the police. You're not keeping my money. (I picked up my phone to call the non emergency number) \n\nI guess he didn't want to deal with the police showing up, so he decided to give my money back, making sure to let me know once again that it was \"fake\" and I paid with smaller bills and got my food. \n\nWhen I left, I went immediately to the bank and changed it for 20s. Because it was indeed real money. I wish I could have made the manager go to the bank with me. \n\nHow hard would it really be to just google it?? I don't think I've ever been so frustrated with a restaurant in my life. I really hope he googled it or spoke with an older manager so this doesn't happen to anyone else. \n\n**TL; DR** Employees are too young to understand that money didn't always have holograms on it and try to tell me my money was fake.

        "text": "A minor note before I go into this story.  I work in tech support. We're not talking the \"have you rebooted it\" outsourced type, but serious tech support.  The kind that deals with digging through code to fix issues, patching, and some hardware support. \n\nRecently I found myself thinking about upgrading my graphics card, not because I really needed one, but I thought it'd be just a nice change compared to what I had.  So with that in mind, I headed down to the local big box tech store on my way home after work.  I head inside, wander back to the parts department, and start looking through the shelves for the specific card I'd had my eye on.  It's about this time that one of the salesmen approached.\n\nSales: Finding everything you need?\n\nMe: Not entirely sure. \n\nSales:  Well what do you need help with?\n\nMe: I'm looking at getting a new Graphics Card, but...\n\nSales: (Cutting me off) Well, it depends what you're doing with it. Take this (Grabs a cheap card) It's good for most things, but you don't want that.  Nah, you need this. (Grabs the most expensive card.) \n\nMe:  You think so huh?\n\nSales: Oh yeah.  I'm an expert!\n\nMe: -muttering \"sure you are.\"- (aloud): I get that you're trained in these things to some degree, but you didn't let me finish explaining the issue.\n\nSales: -rolling his eyes- Oh, go on then.\n\nMe:  As I was about to say, I'm looking for a Graphics Card, but I'm not sure what kind of connector this type has or if it's for a Laptop or Tower. It doesn't say it on the box, and I need a specific type to fit my system.\n\nSales: They're all the same thing! I don't know what gives you the idea they're different. \n\nMe: Education, training, experience...\n\nSales: What?\n\nMe:  Ever hear of [well known tech support company]?\n\nSales:  And?\n\nMe: (producing badge) I'm a technical support agent for them. So yeah, the connections are different. I don't need the up sell into something more expensive than what I want, and I don't need the condescending \"I know everything\" attitude.  I just need to know what kind of connection this is,  or if it's for a Laptop or tower.\n\nSales: Whatever. They're the same &lt;censored&gt; thing! Here. (Grabbing a box off the shelf.) That's the one you want. \n\nWith that he left.\n\nI ended up having to go back a second time, returning the one he picked up when I found out that yes, it was a Laptop card. I also had a long talk with the department's manager, and the store manager about my experience.  They ended up trading me the PC version (which was 50 bucks more) even for the laptop card I'd picked up, and assured me that they were going to have a long sit down with that employee.  I got the impression that this wasn't the first time something like that had happened. ",

        "text": "I'm on mobile blah blah you get it. \n\nSo today I went to my local grocery store to buy some ingredients for my lunch. I only had a few things so I decided to go through the express lane. In front of me are a grandmother with her two grandchildren and an old couple. It should be known that the old couple is white and the grandmother is African American- it's relevant to the story. \n\nSo the grandmother is checking out and she pulls out these checks, from what I could deduce they were welfare checks. The cashier, who used to go to school with me, hadn't seen that form of welfare before so she, understandably, called her manager for help. She couldn't have spent more than 1 minute waiting for her manager when the old white lady started. \n\nOWL is old white lady. OWG is her husband. \n\nOWL: *sigh* we got in the wrong lane\n\nOWG:...uh huh\n\nOWL: *deep sigh* this is taking forever, isn't she trained to handle this?\n\nOWG:...yup\n\nOWL: *deeper sigh* it's been forever where is the manager?\n\nOWG:...coming I guess\n\nOWL: I have ice cream, it's going to melt by the time he gets here\n\nOWG:...it's fine\n\nFinally, after a whopping 3 minutes the manager comes and starts helping the cashier with the checks\n\nOWL: oh thank god I thought I'd have to get another box of ice cream\n\nThe manager spends a minute explaining the checks to the cashier and helping the grandmother pack up her things before the old bat starts again. \n\nOWL: yeah treat her with baby gloves, she got herself in that situation, look at her! Tsk! Probably probably spent all of her real money on drugs, look at her face!\n\nNow, the grandmother had, from the looks of it, either Bell's palsy or a stroke because one side of her face was drooping. The entire time she was sweet and kept apologizing for the extra time it was taking to run her checks. Finally, it's the old bats turn at the register. \n\nOWL: finally, I have things I need to do today! I can't wait in line all day, look at my ice cream, it's probably melted. \n\nCashier: sorry ma'am but our system is old and can be a bit touchy \n\nOWL: well that's no excuse! Look at her, probably doesn't even work, who'd hire her!\n\nC: ... *retail smile shows up* \n\nOWL: honestly those-those people are just *shuts her mouth and shakes her head vigorously*\n\nCashier who is part African: *retail smile* have a nice day\n\nI get it lady, you wanted your precious ice cream to remain frozen, but to assume so much about a person because they're African American and have welfare checks is disgusting.  You don't know what she's been through, an extra 5 minutes at the check out line isn't gonna kill you. Well, she was old so maybe...",

I was standing in line to pay, and landed behind another customer.\n\nFor the visual, it's a 60-ish woman with expensive clothes and overly styled hair, holding a box of paper.  Apparently she'd had several hundred dollars worth of business pamphlets printed off.  And she wasn't happy with the quality of the work - apparently the ink she chose for the print job didn't appear the way she intended on the paper she had selected.  Color contrast problems, or whatnot.\n\nThe college-student cashier should have told her, of course. She was entitled to COMPENSATION for her MASSIVE INCONVENIENCE that the ink she chose was just THE WRONG SHADE OF BLUE.\n\nTherefore, well of course, she was ENTITLED to just walk away from the store carrying the box, not having to pay -- because of course she still needed the product, but the color problem RUINED the work so she had NO CHOICE but to hand out a substandard product to her customers.  And for the inconvenience, she NATURALLY did not have to pay for the product.\n\nAfter informing the cashier of her unilateral decision, she picks up the box, turns toward the door - and walks right into a uniformed police officer who has just witnessed the entire one-sided interaction, so far without comment.\n\nOfficer just has to ask one question:  \"Would you like to make a different choice?\"  And I could see the woman processing the instant change in situation.  Trying to find a way to get out of the situation with both free product and intact pride.\n\nNot being able to find a way to continue, she goes pale, turns back to the smirking cashier, and (hands shaking) she writes out a check.\n\nScore one for karma.",

        "text": "A few days ago, I posted about the verbal altercation I got into with a woman that cut in front of the whole line at the convenience store near my house, and how that incident was strike three for that store.  The following story is strike two.\n\nAs I mentioned, at some point this store fired all of their friendly, competent employees and replaced them with not such bright bulbs.  One of these bulbs was a guy in his mid to late 20's.  The first time I encountered him, I was buying cigarettes.  The interaction, after an exchange of basic pleasantries, went as follows (I'll be \"Me\", he'll be \"AC\" for Annoying Cashier):\n\nMe: \"Pack of Camel Lights, please.\"\n\nAC: \"Oh, I'm sorry, I just can't sell those to you.\"\n\nI've been smoking for long enough to know where this was going, I could tell from his tone.  I'm mentally rolling my eyes.\n\nAC, continuing: \"Nope, I'm sorry, you're obviously not old enough to buy cigarettes, I can't sell you those.\"\n\nI'm in my late 30's, and even though I look quite a bit younger (I credit this to good genes and my decision not to procreate), I'm clearly old enough to buy cigarettes. I don't know what it is, but I find it incredibly irritating when cashiers try to joke with me that I'm too young to buy cigarettes or alcohol.  I know that the intention of this type of \"joke\" is to flatter me, but I think it's really condescending, and all it ultimately does is remind a person that she is, in fact, old.  I can't quite articulate the way it makes me feel, all I know is that it annoys me to no end. Still, AC just started working at this store, and I assumed he was just trying to be friendly, so I played along, smiled, maybe gave a small laugh, whatever.  I eventually got my cigarettes and left.\n\nThe next time I ended up at his register, maybe a week later, he launched into the same spiel.  I'm still annoyed, but ok, maybe he didn't remember me, I still smiled politely but was definitely more subdued in my reaction.\n\nOver the next 4-6 weeks, I ended up at his register about 5 times, and he launched into this \"joke\" every single time. After the second time, when he would start this nonsense, I would just stare at him, not smiling, not talking, not reacting at all. I hoped that my lack of response would cue him onto the fact that I didn't find this amusing.  But no. As time went on, he escalated.  His performance became longer and he became louder and more animated, so that the final iteration of this dialog went something like this:\n\nMe: \"Pack of Camel Lights, please.\"\n\nAC: \"[Not moving from the register] Nope!  No can do. Sorry about that, I can't sell you those. [Turning to go get the cigarettes from the case behind him] Do you know why I can't sell you these? You're obviously not old enough to buy cigarettes. [Walking back to the register] I can't risk losing my job by selling these to you, I'm sorry about that, but there's just nothing I can do, no ma'am, you're clearly not old enough...\"\n\nLiterally, from the moment I told him what I wanted, to the moment he scanned my cigarettes, he would make a huge production out of this monologue.  It was ridiculous and embarrassing.  On a few different occasions, I had been behind people that bought cigarettes or beer at his register, and I never heard him do this to anyone else. It got to the point where, if I was with my boyfriend and I saw AC at one of the registers, I would make my boyfriend go into the store and I'd wait in the car just to avoid interacting with AC.\n\nFinally, I decided I had had enough with this nonsense.  Our next interaction went something like this:\n\nMe: \"Pack of Camel Lights, please.\"\n\nAC: \"I'm sorry, I can't sell you those ---\"\n\nMe (cutting him off): \"Does that work?\"\n\nAC:  \"Ma'am?\"\n\nMe:  \"Every time I come in here, you say the exact same thing to me, about how I'm not old enough to buy cigarettes.  So, does that work?  Do people actually find that amusing?\"\n\nAC (looking flustered):  \"Yes, customers usually enjoy my joking around with them.\"\n\nHe ended up apologizing and seemed sincere, and I left feeling confident that it wouldn't happen again. I also decided that the next time I ended up at his register, I would be friendly and give him the opportunity to act like a normal person.  You know, clean slate and all that.\n\nSadly, acting like a normal person seems to be a bit of a struggle for AC.  At our next encounter, I smiled, made eye contact and said, \"Hi, how are you?\" During the transaction, AC was obviously nervous and it was a bit awkward, but generally successful.  Until the very end, when he called me \"Young Lady\" twice.  IIRC, he said something along the lines of, \"Will that be all, young lady?\" and \"Have a good night, young lady.\"\n\nFFS, AC, can we just get through one transaction without you commenting on my age in some way?  I don't think he was intentionally trying to mess with me, I think he was just really nervous.  But still. Strike 3 came shortly after this, so I haven't seen him since.\n\nI do want to add that I have no problem with employees chatting with me or joking around or whatever.  At places that I go to frequently, I actually enjoy talking with and getting to know employees.  If this guy had just tried to have a normal conversation with me, instead of carrying on this act every time I was at his register, there wouldn't have been an issue.  I just grew resentful of the fact that I was continually expected to play along every. single. time. when all I wanted to do was get a pack of cigarettes and be on my way.",

        "text": "I walked into a chain sandwich shop today at a non-peak time right after another person. There was only one guy working the counter and he helped the first customer, made his sandwich and rang him up. The whole transaction took about 3 minutes. He comes back to me and the first thing he said was \"I'm sorry about that wait.\" I was like dude don't be sorry it was a 3 minute wait and I can see you are the only person behind the counter. The rest of the transaction he said \"I'm sorry\" or \"sorry about that\" three more times. \n\nMade me think what that does to his self esteem. When you are constantly apologizing (for no reason) you are putting yourself down and beneath the person you are apologizing to. I'm sure sandwich shop works that into their training about apologizing. I work in a chain pharmacy and we are instructed to say \"I'm sorry about that\" at any perceived slight and then apologize again at the end of the transaction. The guy at the sandwich shop looked like retail was getting to him and I'll be the I'm sorry thing is a small part of it. \n\nI stopped saying I'm sorry all the time at work and it's done wonders for my attitude while I'm there. When we actually do f*ck up I make sure to say I apologize rather than I'm sorry and that little change makes the difference, plus I hope people can tell that I'm being sincere. I tried saying \"that's unfortunate\" to people when bad stuff happens that's not our fault but I feel like I'm coming off as a dick when I say that. \n\nHope your day gets better sandwich shop guy!\n\n",

        "text": "On mobile. Sorry for formatting. \n\n\nToday I had to go to The Big Blue Store to pick up a gift for my daughter's 1st grade gift exchange. I've been sick since Friday with no voice, so I decided to hit up the bakery for some cupcakes and cookies as there's no way in hell I'm baking for this party. Yep. I'm a sucky mom. \n\n\nBut I digress. \n\n\nWe get all of our goodies fairly quickly and go to checkout and get a quickly moving line with a jovial young man. But I'm feeling overwhelmed for some reason. I guess my head wasn't in the shopping game today. \n\n\nHe gets her gift bagged, then scans her cupcakes. Then begins trying to put a 12 pack of frosted cupcakes in a bag. The sticker gets stuck to the bag. He's shifting and shoving the cupcakes into the bag and I see that the cupcakes are getting knocked around and are no longer sitting up straight. *Ugh* \n\n\nI reach out my hand to stop him and point out that the cupcakes are getting messed up. He just looks at me, horrified. I just shake my head and ask him to please not bag the next set of cupcakes. He looks at me nervously. I sound like Darth Vadar's heavy smoking grandma right now, and I don't look much better, so I'm sure he was afraid I was about to come across the counter at him. I half smile and shrug at him. \n\n\nHe finishes up and gives me my total. It comes to $41.62. Great. I hand him $102. I didn't want a bunch of ones. I just wanted some twenties. He looks at me again like I have a horn growing from my forehead. \n\nCashier: \"Ma'am, it's only $41.62. You gave me too much.\" And tries to hand me the two ones back. \n\nMe: \"No. I don't want a bunch of...hack, couch, phlegm sounds....\" pushing it back towards him. My eyes are watering and I'm sweating. \n\n\nHe just stands there, staring at his till trying to work it out in his head. He finally figures it out and gives me my correct change. \n\n\nI still feel bad about being rude. Please, Christmas, be over already. ",

        "text": "So recently found this subreddit and after alot of lurking felt the need to share. This happened about a year ago. My family and I just moved to a cold climate state in the usa from a very hot and humid country, needless to say we bundle up like we're heading a expedition to the Artics when the temperatures hit below 70. \n\nSo during a trip to a big blue box store that has everything, so noticed a bin with fleece lined leggings for *only* $3. We jumped at the chance to be more insulated and grabbed 8 (2 each). \n\nAt the checkout we noticed our bill was higher, waaayyyyyyy higher then expected. Go through the receipt and we see the legging ringed up as $9 instead of $3. I go back to the cashier and told her it was rung up wrong but she dismissed us and said go talk to customer service. Ooookay, so I sent my parents to make sure they were $3 while my sister and I waited in line at customer service.\n\nThere was a lady in front of me with the exact same problem. She gets to the desk and they adjust her receipt, no problem, no question asked. When it's my turn, the lady(NL for nice lady) just grins and says I'm the 7th customer she's price adjusted so far. As she goes to adjust, the manager/supervisor(B for something that rhymes with itch), who was working the register next to ours, jumps in and asks \"are you sure that's $3? Because I've seen them and they're $9\". \n\nMy sister and I tell her, no we're pretty sure the bin marked them as $3, even the lady at the desk helping us told her. While we were arguing with the B, I notice an employee(B2), who was listening to us, slink off. So I tell my sister to go get a picture of the bin. After a bit of back and forth the B tells me to take her to where I got them and I agree, sure and lead her to the now nearly empty bin. When we get there and my sister arguing with the B2 we saw slink off. She's accusing them of ripping of the price sticker, and B2 denying it (the white ripped label was still there), my parents, in their broken english, also confirm the employee ripped off the price sticker. But B2 continuously denies it.\n\nB, very smugly, says \"See, there's no marking that says it's $3.\" I told her the lady before us got them from the same bin and her price was adjusted, to which she replied \"they were different ones\" and that there's nothing that she can do. I just stare at her while she and the other employee smirks smugly. I then walk off the the customer service desk and return them. NL helps me again, and she's apologizing, over and over about how if she could she would give them for $3 but she could lose her job if she did now. I tell her not to worry about it. \n\nI feel the need to disclose that we had a very fresh off the boat vibe/look to us and I don't know if that's why B and B2 did what they did. To this day I don't know/understand if we were in the wrong or not. Suffice to say we didn't go back to that particular outlet again.\n\n",

        "text": "I've lived in my current home for three and a half years.  Just off the interstate, there's a convenience store that I used to stop in for cigarettes at least five times a week on my way home.  Strike one against this store happened about two years after I moved to this area, when they replaced their entire staff seemingly overnight.  Gone were the four or so middle aged ladies that had the sarcastic and IDGAF attitude that must come from decades of working minimum wage.  But they were friendly and good at their jobs and always had my cigarettes ready for me when I stepped up to the counter (I love employees that recognize and take care of their regulars).  These awesome ladies were replaced with, well, not such bright people who made no effort to hide the fact that they hated their job.  It came through in their attitude and performance.\n\nThe tale I am about to relay was strike three for this store.  I will preface this by saying that I believe there is a special place in hell for people who cut in line.\n\nThe layout of this store is as follows: When you walk in, directly in front of you, about 10-15 feet from the entrance, is register A.  Maybe 5-10 feet to the left of that is register B. Past the registers, down a hallway, are the bathrooms.  Between the two registers, in the middle of the floor, is a fairly large display case with things like phone chargers, ear buds and sunglasses.  The space between the two registers is fairly cramped because of this.  \n\nIn the years I had been going to this store almost every day, I had never seen two separate lines form for each register, people always lined up single file and just stepped up to whichever register became available. Because of where the front door was in relation to the registers, and because of the large display case, it would have been nearly impossible, and very confusing, to have two separate lines, as they would ultimately blend into one line due to lack of space.\n\nOne evening, there are customers at both registers and I am next in line.  I had been waiting for several minutes. There are, I think, two people lined up behind me. The customer at register B finished up just as a lady came out of the bathrooms.  Before I had a chance to move, bathroom lady swoops in and steps up to register B, completely ignoring the people waiting in line.  Since line cutting pisses me off to no end, I wasn't going to just stand there and do nothing.  (This whole incident took less than two minutes.  I didn't yell or curse, but I raised my voice slightly out of frustration).\n\nMe, stepping towards line cutting bathroom lady (BL), \"Excuse me, I was next.\"\n\nBL, not turning to look at me:  \"There's two lines.\"\n\nMe, growing frustrated: \"No, there's one line, I've been waiting, I was next, you just came out of the bathroom.\"\n\nBL continues to insist there's two lines, and starts going on about how she doesn't have time for this shit, how she's had a long day, how she's tired, ect.  She was really quite nasty. I respond that I don't have time for it either, that I also would like to get home and that I've been waiting in line for several minutes.  I believe that I also asked BL how she could just be okay cutting the entire line.\n\nI went back and forth with BL a few times.  During all of this, the cashier at register B, a young girl, is just standing there like a deer in the headlights.  The cashier at register A, middle aged woman with a surly attitude, pipes up, and in an irritated and condescending tone pretty much tells me (me specifically, not BL) to shut up and stop arguing. \n\nMe: \"But she just came out of the bathroom and cut the entire line.\"\n\nThe surly cashier pretty much repeats what she said to me previously.\n\nCompletely exasperated, I look at the young cashier at register B and say something along the lines of, \"Is there one line or two lines in this store?\"\n\nTo which she meekly replies, \"There's two lines.\"\n\nI turn around and look towards the entrance, extend my arm, point to the single file line of about five customers waiting and say, \"One line.\"\n\nThe next day I called corporate (a local/regional oil company owns this chain of convenience stores) to complain.  The district manager was supposed to call me but never did.  Now I go to a different store that is not a chain, but more of a mom &amp; pop type place.  Going there adds ten minutes to my drive home, but the owner is a really nice guy, as are all of the employees.\n\nPerhaps I was expecting too much from cashiers at a convenience store, and it's quite possible that I was the asshole here for making a scene, but I do think it's the employees responsibility to maintain order to the best of their ability, which includes making sure people don't fragrantly cut the line.  \n\nI'm also of the belief that unless there are designated lanes, as in a grocery store, typically one line forms even if there are multiple registers open, as at the drugstore (I'd be interested to hear other's opinions on this).  At the very least, how hard it is to ascertain that other people are waiting, and to simply ask if they are waiting or if there's a line or whatever?\n\nStrike two for this store was a result of a male cashier hitting on me in the most lame and cringe-worthy way every time I ended up at his register.  I can tell that story, too, if y'all are interested.\n\n",

I looked over the choices for glasses beforehand because I knew my eyes would need to be dilated. Afterwards I had my mom help look for the pair I liked from before when a young associate came up to see if she could help. She was probably no older than 20 and as such said something stupid that I can only imagine she regretted and has since learned her lesson. \n\nAs I tried on a pair of glasses she said \"oh, don't get those. They make you look chinky\". Me being of Asian descent said the only thing I could think of. \"I can't help it, I am chinky\". The look of horror on her face was enough to let me know she knew she fucked up. I let it go because I didn't want to get a young girl fired, but to this day I regret paying $200 for that pair of glasses instead of getting them for free. ",

I went back to the store (40 miles away!), who said it was a \"store\".com order, and it was their problem. The store manager called \"store\".com and talked to them for a while, and said that I would have a refund in a few days. \n\nA week later, i get an email from the online store and they say that they have no record of me being charged for the order.  \n\nI tried contacting the store manager again, but he wouldn't respond to my calls or emails. I tried contacting the \"store\".com several times, who again said there was no record of the purchase. I would then give them the receipt number, and they would tell me I would have a refund a few days later. I would then get yet another email saying there was no record of the payment, and the order was just cancelled. \n\nIt's now December and I'm still fighting this. I'm not sure what to do. I have: \n-Email with order number saying order was cancelled and was not charged\n-Bank statement saying I was charged for the amount\n-Receipt saying I was charged\n\nI'm just really frustrated. I'm considering small claims court, although it would cost more than I'd get back for the pants. \n\n\nTLDR: Placed order at \"store\", paid, was told it was cancelled, but I didn't get the money back",

Should you need assistance with anything else, we would be happy to help.\n\n\n\n**Me (the dope):**\n\nI am not saying I don't agree with your policies, I just pointed out that the reason you changed my username was because of your policy to not have usernames that could be associated with a company or logo and that the new username you have given me violates that same policy.\n \nI have also seen many other names that could be associated with logos or companies and they have not had their names changed. Granted you encourage other players to report these people, but there are a good number of usernames that would fall into that category even without taking into account the other limitations your policy imposes.\n\nThe only problem I have is with how this policy is being enforced and that it is so broad it limits the number of possible usernames, and shrinks it even further when you take into account that you can't use any first or last names. And from what I can tell the latter is very loosely enforced as it is too broad. \n\nI will just end on the note that if you are changing players’ usernames for violating your username policy to usernames that violate your policy it may be time to rethink your policy.\n\n**So basically they not only violate their own policy, but they allow other players (quit famous ones I might add) also violate their policy, but enforce it on me. I really want to have a chat, but it seems they will just sidestep and avoid me.**\n\n**Edit:**\n**I would like to add that there is another username under my account and it is exactly the same spelling as the changed username (with the exception of one letter) and that username remains unchanged. For example 1st username was sirwhatever and the other username is sirswhatever** ",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I just discovered this neat little sub while searching for a place to share this. ~~Apologies if I get too wordy. I'll try my best to keep it concise without omitting too much... No promises!~~ I feel like it got pretty fucking long. Sooo, you're here to kill a bit of time right? I can't promise I'll entertain you much but I can waste your time. xD\n\n**Background:** \n\n***\n\nI moved into a new apartment a couple months ago. Yesterday morning, I saw two specks of dust moving around on the screen of a laptop which had been lying on the floor beneath a window. Inspection of the window revealed mold, Google helped me decide the creepy-crawlers were mold mites. I also found mold on 3 other windows. Needless to say, immediate action was required.\n\nMy hygrometer read 80% humidity. With current outdoor temperatures (20-40 ºF), indoor humidity should be 40% or below to prevent condensation. A dehumidifier will play a vital part in the upcoming battle vs mold. After I got to work, I began shopping online for one I could pick-up that day, hopefully at lunchtime so I could begin the cleansing process right away.\n\n**Prologue:** \n\n____\n\nI found the best dehumidifier deal at a big blue mart store. They have 2 in stock. Now, this is a pretty big purchase I wasn't prepared for, so when the ad about saving 15% by signing up for their store credit card appeared I was all over that shit. *Relevant T&amp;C: Must use today. Must use online.* \n\n&gt;Your order will be ready by 1:57pm. \n\nGreat!\n\nSoo.... around 4:30 I get ahold of a live chat representative who says my order is okay and that I'll be able to pick up today. They're just running a bit slow. \n\nAt around 6:30 my SO and I decide to go eat dinner at a white fortress across the road from the store. Still no notification.\n\nWe go to the store after eating (roughly 7:30) to see what's up and as I'm parking I get a notification. Awesome! Perfect timing, right?! Right!?\n\n&gt;Your order is delayed. 3 to 5 day estimate.\n\nWTF? \n\n**The Trouble Begins:**\n\n***\n\nWell, we're already here. Can't hurt to take a look around.\n\nWe find the section with the label \"dehumidifiers\" easily enough, however, there's only one unit on the shelf (*it's surrounded by humidifiers*) and it has no price tag. Their app scanned the barcode and gave me a price easily enough, so at least that's good. It's twice as much as the one I ordered though. Nope! \n\nThe app says the one I want is in stock so I go to find an employee. [Me = Me, duh. UE = Unhelpful Employee]\n\n&gt; Me: Excuse me... Hey how's it going?\n\n&gt; UE: \n\n&gt; Me: Your app says you have several dehumidifiers in stock including *this one* but I only see a single unit on the shelf.\n\n&gt; UE: I don't think it says that. Show me where it says \"in stock\".\n\n&gt; Me: *Points to \"in stock\"*\n\n&gt; UE: Well we don't know that's this store, it's probably a different store.\n\n&gt; Me: *Scrolls up. Points to store location.*\n\n&gt; UE: *Lots of rambling about how sometimes they don't do  inventory scanning right and how the computer can't be trusted. If it isn't on that shelf where the \"dehumidifiers\" label is they don't have it.*\n\nI say something about it being strange that the system would be so far off on these rather expensive items but he wasn't having any of it. He says to go to a different store. I ask if it's worth my time to try calling them first and he starts rambling about how you can find store numbers on Google.\n\n*By now I want to get the fuck away from him but he just keeps talking as I try to disengage.* (I've got nothing against this guy, he was actually quite friendly... He just wasn't very helpful... which I kind of understand from reading tfr stories about \"looking in the back\".)\n\nMy SO and I return to the section we found the first unit and redouble the search effort, near the mysterious \"the back\" of the store. My SO notices there's a shelf along the back wall next to the double-doors that has miscellaneous items, and it wasn't long after that that we're looking at 2 dehumidifiers with the same model number as the one I ordered.\n\nThere wasn't an employee in sight but we were next to the ladders section so I sent SO to wait in the pick-up line while I got it down. I'm in a good mood now since things are looking like they're going to go well after all! \n\nYou know where this is going. \n\n**The Shit-Show:**\n\n***\n\nWhen we get to the counter we provide the order number and show that we have it in our cart. They can't complete the checkout. There's nothing they can do but call the 800 number, which I say I will do for them so they can work through the line.\n\nThe robot tells me it'll be a while and they can call me back when the next agent is free so I agree to do that. I got to work on reordering the unit on my phone because it was still listed available for pick-up today. They call back before I send the order through and I answer, thinking it'll be easier if they just switch my current order back from shipping to pick-up.\n\nI explain what's happening. The girl says this is a site to store order, is currently being shipped, and will be ready in 3 to 5 days. I reiterate, with emphasis on the facts that it was a pick-up today order and that I'm there with the item in my cart.\n\nThis goes back and forth a few times before she finally seems to understand what's going on. She wants to speak with an employee so I hand my phone over with an apology to a somewhat confused associate.\n\nThere's still nothing they can do. If I cancel and pay in store I lose my 15% deal. I'm literally looking at the item in my cart while being told I have to wait for it to ship to the store.\n\n*This is fucking ridiculous.*\n\nThe phone agent offers a discount if I wait, but I want this thing today damnit! It's 'paid for' and right fucking in front of me. I ask her not to do anything because I think I can just reorder it for pick-up today. \n\nWell, after the call guess what? It's now listed as available in 5 days instead of today, like it was before the call.\n\nFuck me. \n\nThe store had a manager come over but she couldn't give me 15% off. There were 3 employees here talking about it now and one of them said that the phone agents can fix it, they just don't want to. I tried calling back but they hung up on me immediately after I explained what I wanted. \n\nI ended up just buying the one there with the intention of returning it when my 15% cheaper one comes in.\n\n**Epilogue:**\n\n***\n\nI was pretty (justifiably, I think) pissed-off about the ordeal and I ended up calling the 800# back on the way home. The girl I got was pretty slow but I didn't mind. I just mute the phone in between having to let her know I'm still there while she tries to figure something out. *Waste of time? Probably. But I know I'm wasting theirs too which gives me an odd satisfaction.*\n\nI wanted to make the argument about how ridiculous their system is with someone who can do something about it, but my expectations couldn't have been lower at this point. At least I was home. \n\nI had the dehumidifier running, a very tall, very strong drink, and Cities: Skylines! I was in a reasonably good mood when I finally got transferred (nearly 2 hours) by the first girl's supervisor to the next (and final) level of representation. *Spoiler alert: This third-line person has no more real authority than the front line-agents.* \n\nI ended getting an extra 20% off the dehumidifier that's being shipped, so I got that going for me, which is nice.\n\n***\n\n**TL:DR:**\n\nGot mold. High humidity. Same-day in-store pick-up dehumidifier. 15% off online order. Clerk can't find it. I found 2 in stock. I want it now. So, I have to purchase for full price in store and return it when the one I ordered online comes in, 3 to 5 days later. \n\n[Edit for formatting and minor corrections.] ",

        "text": "Hey guys!\n\nThis is my first time posting on this subreddit, so I apologize if I mess up.\n\nSo tonight, my boyfriend wanted to celebrate his 21st birthday with a few of his friends in his favorite restaurant, a chain famous for their wings. For the sake of the story, I will be me, my boyfriend BF, and his friends KH, JD, EV, and TS. \n\nThe night started out fine. My boyfriend, his five friends, and I are enjoying ourselves. Our waiter was constantly apologizing and forgetting our refills, but that's normal. He was new, he told us, so we all understood.\n\nUntil we paid.\n\nWe received our first round of checks around 8. Yes, first round. You see, the waiter ended up using the wrong cards for almost all the meals. Repeatedly. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. \n\nWhen we all first got our checks to give him the cash or cards, **we all had the right receipts**. Everyone was paying for their own meal (JD pays for JD's meal, KH pays for KH's meal, etc), expect I was also paying for my BF. BF was paying for his own drink. We told the waiter this when we ordered so there would be no complicated changing checks when it arrived. And he got it right! We placed our cards around our receipts so he wouldn't get confused. \n\nAll the trouble started after he picked up the checks.\n\nFirst, he dropped JD's card, which luckily KH saw after our waiter left. This resulted in us waiting for our checks for a while. When he comes back, JD gives him the card back and explains that the waiter must've dropped it. All good, again it happens. Well, he starts handing out the checks. Turns out amongst all the confusing on where JD's card was, he ended up charging meals to the wrong card. KH's card ended up paying for my BF's drink (I was paying for his meal, and BF was paying for his drink since I'm underage) and my BF's card paid for KH's meal. This was not right. BF wanted to buy his own drink, KH wanted to buy his own meal. Wrong card to the wrong check. At this point, I don't see my check. EV and TS get their right checks back. Our waiter leaves to fix everything and charge JD for his meal. \n\nHe forgets JD's card again.\n\nLuckily he comes back to get it. Again.\n\nAfter a while, he comes back a second time with our \"right checks\". Spoiler alert, they weren't. Things were even worse. KH was still being charged for my BF's drink, my BF was paying nothing now, JD was being charged for KH's meal, and I was being charged for only half the amount my check was supposed to be. It was another mix up of the wrong card to the wrong check, or just plain wrong check in general. \n\nAt this point, he gets the manager to help. Good. We'll get our right checks and be paid for what we actually got. \n\nThe manager comes over and asks what's wrong. I explain that I was paying for my meal and my BF's meal, so the amount was double than what my receipt says. Then BF explains how KH ended up being charged for BF's drink, and JD says that he ended up being charged for KH's meal. Remember, KH just wanted his own check with his own meal. BF just wanted to pay for his own drink. Notice that JD's receipt is gone somewhere. We have no idea where is went at this point.\n\nSo the manager leaves with the waiter to fix everything. Yeah, no.\n\nManager comes back and hands my BF a receipt and his card. The receipt was for our meal. No, I say. I explained to him again how I was paying for the meal. This was wrong. Again. The wrong card with the wrong check. I'm normally pretty patient, but I was done. So manager leaves to fix it.\n\nHe comes back again. I finally pay for my BF's birthday meal. JD gets to pay for his meal. But, of course, something is still wrong. KH is still being charged for my BF's drink. At this point, it's been an hour since we first got our checks, and the manager wants us to leave. So he comps the drink, which he probably should've done in the first place. He only apologizes and explains that the guy is new. We know, but this is a big mess up. We will have multiple charges for 48 hours before they are cleared. We're college students. We can't afford to have overdraft fees. \n\nThe manger leaves. Then we realize that KH never paid for his own meal, which is what his original check said. His meal is no where on our receipts. The restaurant wants us to leave, and we honestly don't want to deal with this anymore. So in the end, we just leave without paying for KH's meal. Apparently the manger didn't care about it, so we weren't going to fight for it after being there an hour longer than what we needed to be. \n\nNeedless to say, I will be watching my bank account for the next few days, along with my friends. This was my worst waiter experience ever.\n\nEdit: I went back to clarify the whole exchange. I made it sound like people were supposed to pay for other peoples meals when that wasn't the case. Everyone was supposed to buy their respective meal. JD wanted to pay for his own meal, KH wanted to pay for his own meal, so on, with me buying my BF's meal and mine, and BF wanted to buy his own drink. \n\nAt first, the checks were right. Everyone was paying for the right thing. But when the waiter went to go swipe the cards, he mixed them up, despite the checks being folded over the right cards. This happened a couple of times. The manager even screws up. KH's original check disappears in the end and we have no idea where it went, so he ends up getting a free meal. \n\nI hope this clears up some of the post! If it's still too confusing, let me know.\n\n",

        "text": "A few tales around here today about customers threatening employees jarred an old memory loose today. The story actually begins many years after the incident happened during a retelling of the odd story.\n\nI was serving overseas with the Army Reserves and as happens, made life-long friends within the unit as we had no place to go and no one else to talk to. Somehow my employment at the office supply chain named for one of its products came up in casual conversation. My best friend, Parrot, while overseas at the time mentions that he’d been there a few times as he lived only one town over and it was closer than the nearest big city for computer equipment. I told him I used to work in the computer equipment section of that very store. So he asks me how long I worked there and if I knew all of the people who worked in that section. I told him of course, I was there from the day the store opened until the day it closed. He proceeds to tell me of the weirdest encounter with a retail employee he’s ever had.\n\nParrot and a friend have come into town looking for a computer. They ask about a particular low-priced model in the sale ad for the week and the employee takes them to that display model. The employee asks if they need anything else and Parrot and his friend say no, so he goes off to do his retail thing. A minute or so later they realize this isn’t the correct model and that the sale computer appears to be sold out, there’s none on the shelf. They flag down the guy that led them there and ask him and he confirms that, yes, they are out of stock. When Parrot and his friend look at each other to discuss what they’re going to do, the guy sneaks off and when they turn to look they see him ***running*** into the back of the store.\n\nParrot approaches the front register and asks them to page the kid because they want to ask for his recommendation on another in-stock model. Manager pages him over the store loudspeaker. A few seconds later, over the loudspeaker, the kid gives the “cancel call” command. He cancelled a call for himself. Manager is confused, stuck there, awkwardly trying to figure out something to say to these guys. Shrugging it off, they decide they don’t have time for this and Parrot and his friend leave and head over to big city Greatest Purchase.\n\nI’ve been close with Parrot now at least 6 months overseas and we were friends before the deployment as we joined the unit at about the same time. I know the guy pretty well now and I feel confident in saying this guy isn’t some alpha-male, don’t get in my way, kind of guy… and my face goes red.\n\nI was that kid.\n\nSee me, pre-Army Basic training, spindly computer-nerd type working in a computer store and still new to customer service and just communicating with strangers in general. So, when they called me over to ask about the stock of the computer on sale, I see two popular kid, jock-types (my own prejudice, probably nothing they did) asking why we’re out of stock on the sale item, and I panicked! I thought for sure these two guys were going to kick my ass. So I ran to the back to take a break even though the store had only been open 30 minutes that morning. I cancelled that call myself, on myself, because I was terrified of facing these two guys again.\n\nParrot laughed himself silly and between breaths explained that he never went back to that store because of the weird kid who hides from customers. Of course, it wasn’t until that moment that I realized how completely insane I looked. Talk about closure.",

So I went to their paperwork island, endorsed the check and filled out all the other paperwork they required, and I walked over to the \"line\" where I could wait to actually process my transaction with one of their tellers.\n\nAs it turned out, I was the only customer in line at that specific moment, and they had three tellers available to help. As most people would, I chose the first of the three who gave me eye contact and said \"hello\". Walked right up and told her what I needed.\n\nCustomer #2 has just entered our story, however. Best thing I can think is that she's never been in a bank before, and she thinks the lines work by \"monkey see monkey do.\" Instead of making eye contact and approaching one of the other two available agents, she follows me immediately -- walks up directly behind me (literally within inches), stands on her toes and looks over my shoulders to get my agent's attention.\n\nDon't know why I didn't deck her. It was just a few seconds before one of the other two agents got her attention and waved her over. Leaving me and my own money-human to wonder what exactly was up with that woman who didn't understand how lines work at banks...\n",

        "text": "This happened about 2 yrs ago. I just remembered because of all of these ridiculously epic posts.\n\n\nSo my wife and I were at a certain store.  (Let's say I decided to wear a burgundy shirt and my tan pants.)\n\n\nAs my wife and I were walking through the aisles we get to the makeup section of this store. My wife needed, whatever wives need from there. We are walking around play fighting like we sometimes do.\n\n\nShe wanted an item that was from one of the departments we had just left, I forgot the specific item.  So and said, \"go get xxx\" I responded, \"no you go get it\".\n\n\nMind you, while we are walking through the makeup section there are these two older ladies, speaking in Spanish, and employees of the fine establishment we are in. They're talking mess on their other co-workers and \"working\" at the same time.  One of them says I need to put this item back, so she took off.\n\n\nThe lady that left was this old stumpy lady, barely breaking 5 ft, if that. She was dark skin and blonde hair. Hair cut so short that it was ear length. Like a bowl cut without the bowl?\n\n\nThe second lady, now this lady was the queen bee(QB), you could easily tell. We noticed her barking orders at these young guys and they were all doing what she said. She was what I would call a shriveled old lady, whose poster wasn't even there. She was probably in her 60's? She had on these black framed thick glasses, you could've easily stated a fire with those bad boys. She was putting up and organizing items while my wife and I were walking around.\n\n\n\nSo we digress, \n\nI tell my wife,\"no you get xxx item.\"\n\n\nFrom the aisle we just passed I heard, \n\n(QB)\"don't you talk to her like that!!! You don't treat the customers like that!! Get what she asked for!!!\"\n\n\nI slowly turn around and ask, \n\n\n(Me)\"what was that?\" \n\n\nZooming around the aisle with justice, she assumed, on her side.\n\n\n(QB) \"go get her...oh wait. You don't work here, do you?\n\n\n(Me) \"no I don't, but what if I did? Do you talk to all your co-workers like that?  \n\n\n(QB) \"I thought you were (so-&amp;-so). you look just like him.  *laughing nervously*\n\n\n(Me)\" you didn't answer my question, do you talk to all your co-workers like that?\n\n\nShe ignored me, my wife is a peace keeper, so she takes the conversation over.\n\n\n(Wife) \"oh he gets confused for other people all the time. (She then preceded to ask the lady for help looking for an item)\n\n\nThis lady never apologized, my wife said she felt bad cause she knew I get pretty aggressive when I want to be.\n\n\nTl;dr- employee confused me for another employee, tried yelling at me. Before I could to nail into her,  My wife stops me\n\n",

        "text": "Long post - not really sure where else to put this. I just want to get it off my chest.\n_________________________________________________\n\n**TL;DR** - I can, for some reason, log into someone else's account on a retail website using my info. Customer service doesn't seem to care that my account info is gone, I'm staring at someone else's CC info/address and that my info could be, in turn, jeopardized, and has been blowing me off. Says it's due to an \"IT issue\". Oops?\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nOn 11/25 I ordered a purse from an upscale department store's website. Had to make an account, not a big deal, got the confirmation emails, all is fine and dandy. Five days later at around 1AM PST (on the 30th), I receive another confirmation email for a new order. Well obviously this is a little curious, so I check it out and it seems to be another person's order. No fraud so far or anything, it's not in my name, but I can see their (censored) credit card info, name, address, etc. Weird, but not entirely impossible I guess. Figured it was just a fluke in the system that sent me their order confirmation. \n\nAt this point I decide to log in to my account to check on shipping and stuff. Use my email and password, and it sends me to... her account...? Weird again, I log out, log back in, same situation. Her email is even written in her info. So this is where it gets concerning. All of my information is gone but I can still log in with my email and see HER orders, HER card info... I could even use her card to place orders (I didn't). It's late, so despite their 24/7 customer service line I write an email asking what the heck was going on and went to bed. \n\nThe next day I went about my morning, and after not even receiving an automated response saying my email was received, I decided to call in. After waiting on hold for a few minutes I spoke with a CSR that was disinterested at best. I gave her the  other person's order number and said that I can log into their account and make purchases. Their solution was for me to either a.) erase her info, cancel her order, and fill out my own info again (?) or b.) create a new account and move on (???). I asked if I could speak to those in charge of security, she said no. I asked if I could receive a followup email, she said no, because it is the other person's account in question. In retrospect I wish I was more firm to speak to management and asked more questions (like if I have her info, can she see mine? Where is my information?)... but the CSR didn't tell me her name and rushed me off the phone. This went from a weird bug to a potential threat to my info and to top it all off, customer service has not been on my side so far. Keep in mind that this is a big retailer, and if this were happening to other people besides me (and logically, why wouldn't it be?), it could potentially be a HUGE security issue. All right around the most fraudulent time of the year...\n\nI feel defeated and end up finding the person from the info in their/my account on Facebook to get an answer. We actually chat for a bit, they are really nice and seem to be in the dark as much as I am. From what I know, they have access to THEIR account and information using THEIR email to log in. So the mystery still stands - where is MY account? Where is my order info? They thank me for telling them and not using their card, say they wrote an angry email too, and I decide to call the store again later that afternoon.\n\nThe second call was better, but still hardly all that helpful. The CSR I spoke to could pull my order up, but didn't tell me anything about the status of my account. She redirected me to security this time, they said they had never seen anything like it, that it was caused by an \"IT issue/accident\" they would \"work on it\" and call me back the next day (yesterday). I feel like I'm still in the dark, but it's fine, I didn't expect an answer right away. Feeling more at ease thinking that they would be getting in touch soon. Still didn't get any CSR names though. Still have no idea who I really spoke to.\n\nSo... it's yesterday and I wait for a call all day. Some time after the sun had gone down I wrote two more emails - one directly in response to the order email (it says to respond for questions/comments) and one using their on-site customer service box. I rehash every detail once again, like how I am still getting emails about this other person's order and I can still get into their account with MY email and password. I made it clear that this order would ultimately be my last, not because of the potential security issue, but because of the apathy and unprofessionalism that this situation has been handled with (in the few times that I've gotten a chance to talk to somebody about it).\n\nI still haven't gotten anything back today. It hasn't been that long, but I feel like every day that I'm ignored is another day that my account could end up being in the wrong hands. Honestly all I wanted was just a followup call or email saying \"Hey, we don't really know what the fk happened to your account but hang in there, we are doing our best to find out. My name is blabla you can ask for me for information or we'll be in touch\". It could have been automated for all I care. But at this point I don't know what to do. I don't know who to call and ask for an update. I've never had such a poor experience with customer service. I'm pretty soft-spoken and sensitive and don't like to cause a scene over this type of thing in the first place, so getting told to just \"make a new account and move on\" is really disheartening. However I still feel like the way this has been handled and the situation in itself is not right, so I plan on calling back Monday. Hopefully I won't even have to, but that's wishful thinking... we'll see what happens I guess.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Update as of 12/5 -** Got an email back. [Here's where I'm at.](https://i.gyazo.com/4caac4d7a5b537a17fcbbe04f29dfbf8.png) More talking in circles, but at least they disabled one account, I guess (\"hacked\", lol). I'm very curious about the \"system issues that have been occurring\" part. Implying it's not just me, maybe?",

Then she asked me if I knew the price of a Christmas tree I was buying and I told her I didn't know (cause I'm supposed to memorize the prices of the items I'm buying) and she sighed and looked at me as if to say \"what the fuck is wrong with you\" and then said something else sarcastic.\nI forget why, but my girlfriend had to go to the car, and the check out lady, now realizing what was happening tried to make small talk suddenly and I completely ignored her because I'm not good with confrontation and if I would have chopped it up with her, it would have caused a pretty big scene.\nMy girlfriend comes back and as I'm standing there, now annoyed as fuck, tell her that I'm taking the cart and going to the car to get away from the situation. My girlfriend told me that after I left, checkout lady said sarcastically to her \"he's very friendly huh?\" and my girlfriend politely told her off and she said she was having a hard day.\nAt the end of the day, I didn't go and complain about her, because I would feel like a complete piece of shit if a 50/60 year old woman lost her job over something stupid.
