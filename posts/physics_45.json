However, in all observations the persistent supercurrent **remains constant** despite all temperature variations and abruptly disappears at the critical temperature.

Even more absurd is that the most stable isotope of Fr (Z=87) is less stable than all elements up to Db (Z=105), which is a transactinide superheavy element; and while At has isotopes with half lives of 7-8 hours, they are synthetic and the isotopes that occur naturally in decay chains all have half lives of less than a minute, thus making them less stable than Sg (Z=106).\n\nWhen you see the table of nuclides colored by half life, there is a noticable... gulf maybe (?) just after Bi-209 from Z=84 to Z=87 and mass numbers 210 to 220 where the half lives are very short.\n\nIs there a name for this phenomenon?

My daughter and I came across a scenario today where we need SCIENCE but I haven't been able to figure out an answer through Google.\n\nThis morning, we noticed that of our two cars parked outside, one windshield was totally frosted over and had to be scraped, and the other was totally clear. We were brainstorming about why the two windshields might have behaved differently. Some notes we took:\n\n* Both cars are located fully outside.\n* The cars are about 20' apart, and each is about 20' from the nearest building.\n* One car (frosted over) is totally uncovered, in that there are no objects anywhere above it. The second car (not frosted) is under the branches of a pine tree, although the closest branches are maybe 5' up, and it's a relatively sparse covering. (For example, if it were to snow, both cars would get snow on the windshield, but the one under the branches would get less.)\n* Neither windshield has been *recently* treated with any products, but I know for sure that the one without the frost was treated with RainX at some point in the past. But it was likely at least six months ago.\n* We don't have any way of knowing if the two windshields are made of different materials.\n\nSo, we're curious about whether the RainX is the likely culprit, or whether there was some physical/science reason why the car under the tree limbs would be less likely to frost up.\n\nWe were thinking of swapping the car locations tonight to see if we get a different result tomorrow morning.\n\nAnyway, just a fun thought, trying to encourage my daughter to think through stuff like this! Would appreciate any ideas.\n\nThanks!",

So hot that the electrons rip away from the nucleus. So really hot.\nBut.. fire? Is that a plasma?? I mean its not solid, liquid or gas, but its not hot enough to break the bond between nucleus and electrons.\nSo what is it??\n\n(If you're up for it, I have more questions, but if you know the one about fire please tell!!)\n-Aurora borelis (Northern lights) are a plasma, but they are not as hot as typical plasma, so how are they plasma? And what would happen if I touched the northern lights?\n---is the electric field plasma? If so, can plasma be invisible?\n-lightning is plasma. I thought it was just electricity? \n---sometimes I see these little electric sparks when plugging in a charger, are they plasma as well?\n-how is plasma ionised if the same amount of electrons and protons are the same as when it's a gas\n\n(Sorry for all the questions, I'm just so curious!!)",

Please answer if one below is understood or not.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser#cite_note-DCQE-1\nFrom scientific information (e..g above) I know when second of pair of photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is \"detected\" by apparatus w/out opportunity for \"interference\", 1st photons are also not producing ridged pattern. Can somebody explain why? By using some interpretation of quantum mechanics and/or by using wave function formulas of the mechanics. Do at least some interpretations of quantum mechanics explain why?\n\nI cited eraser because I've read this paper, my question is about part where \"information\" is not yet \"erased\". Pair is called \"entangled\", but why (if true) it prevents two photons to \"collapse\" in \"different\" points on the screens (I mean if one is \"caught\" w/out deviating \"much enough\" from straight path from the crystal of SPDC why other be doing same)?  \n\nEntanglement here means entangled polarization, isn't it? I also understand from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion \"the pairs have combined energies and momenta equal to the energy and momentum of the original photon\" so paths must be \"symmetrical\", but \"surely\" \"collapse\" locations are not perfectly \"symmetrical\"?",
