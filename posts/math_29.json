        "text": "First lets define a sequential ordinal. In haskell we could write\n\n    SOrd=0| S(SOrd) | N-&gt;SOrd\n\nSo a sequential ordinal is either 0, or the successor of a sequential ordinal, or an infinite increasing list of sequential ordinals. (define increasing by X&gt;Y iff O(X)&gt;O(Y)  )\n\nThere exists a surjective function O(X) that turns Sequential ordinals into countable ordinals. Defined by O(0)=0, O(S(X))=O(X)+1,  and O(\\[X1, X2, ...\\])=sup({O(X1), O(X2), ...})\n\nNow we can define F(SOrd, N)-&gt; N with F(0, n)=0. F(S(X), n) = Busy beaver function for turing machines with n states and oracle access to F(X, . ). F(L,n)= busy beaver function for turing machines of length n with oracle access to \\\\i,j: F(L\\[i\\],j). Here L\\[i\\] means the i'th element in the list, and \"\\\\i,j:\" means a function that takes in i and j and returns F(L\\[i\\],j)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith those defined, I can state my question. \n\nDoes there exist a sequence g:N-&gt;N such that for all countable ordinals ùù∞ there exists X (st O(X)=ùù∞ ) and for all sufficiently large n, g(n) &gt; F(X,n) ?",

Every time I would see the \"Feeding America\" deliveries at my school, I was impressed and thought \"I wish I could support them.\" Also in these past couple years, my state has taken an increased interest in making LGBTQ students feel less than welcome. Again leaving me saying \"I wish I could do something.\" And of course I do things like make students feel welcome and safe in my classroom and on my math team, but I still feel a little helpless. I don't have a ton of money and don't have a ton of volunteer time to spare either. But what I am rich in is math jokes. So, I've started putting math related cards on Etsy to raise money for various worthy causes. My list of cards I want to make is much longer than the list of cards I have made, but with Valentine's Day coming up, I thought I should silence the voice in my head that says \"don't show this to people until your shop is more full.\" So far I have:\n\n* NSFW card about Graham's Number\n* NSFW card about perfect numbers\n* Beautiful card about space filling curves\n* Print at home card about Euler's Identity\n\nIf you have someone in your life who could appreciate a good math card that doesn't really on \"pie\" and \"pi\" being homonyms or \"acute\" sounding like \"cute,\" I encourage you to check out [https://www.etsy.com/shop/QEDArt](https://www.etsy.com/shop/QEDArt)\n\nIf there are any special requests, I'm happy to try to accommodate. Afterall, it's all for a good cause.\n\nAlso, shout out to u/MathemaTurtle who last year posted some math valentines ([https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/ssb9h8/happy\\_valentines\\_day\\_please\\_enjoy\\_these\\_math/](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/ssb9h8/happy_valentines_day_please_enjoy_these_math/)) and offered that I can turn some of them into cards for charity on Etsy. They're on my list of cards to make, but I'm no artist and wow do these take time to get right.",

It‚Äôs an online class and I have a low 40% partly because I haven‚Äôt done math in a while and I‚Äôm working full time so I‚Äôm falling behind. I also believe that online classes aren‚Äôt for me and I learn better in person. I‚Äôm wanting to transfer to a top university for CS or Statistics but I feel as though I‚Äôve lost some skills or what not. My enjoyment towards math is there but the past few years of not training my mind and not continuously learning is currently crippling me. All I‚Äôve done since I graduated high is work. Earlier I went in person to have someone tutor me and that helped a lot. I‚Äôm quickly learning a lot and such but I feel that if I want to transfer into a competitive major and into a top university, I would never need a tutor. I‚Äôve never needed a tutor in math until now from what I recall. What is also messing me up is that since I‚Äôm falling behind, I‚Äôm just cramming all this information in my head in a short amount of time without actually retaining it.\n\nAny real world advice and or experiences?",

To help us, my school made qualifying exams easier to pass and many required courses were made optional (and the ones that were taught remote weren't taught that great but still everyone passed). This left many in my cohort, including myself, with at best a masters level understanding of the material. \n\nI didn't notice the impact that was having until 8 months ago when I attended a conference and noticed other PhD students from other schools were way ahead of me in terms of ability and publications. Since that wake up call I've been working a lot harder by putting in more time on my research and revisiting my first year course work. \n\nMy goal since the beginning was to go into academia and landing a good post doc, but looking at other PhD students I'm not sure how reasonable this is now. For example, I am currently teaching myself math that other PhD students seem to already be an expert in. I will continue trying hard, but am I chasing an unattainable goal? It seems same year PhD students are years ahead of me in my field.",

Not only it includes statistical and ML algorithms, it also includes a good collection of trading indicators. Recently, I have added ability to align DataFrame memory to custom alignment to take advantage of SIMD operations.\n\nThis project is my work mostly done over weekends and other spared times over the last 5+ years. There are also 17 other contributors, all at different levels\n\nDataFrame is much faster and scalable and IMO much more verstile than Pandas. It would be useful for people who program in C++ which I think is a minority of mathematicians -- but we don't forget about minorities!\n\nYour feedback is appreciated",
