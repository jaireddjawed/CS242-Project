        "text": "\n Its kind of a long one\n\nMy boyfriend and I are about 6 months into a relationship...and things have been going pretty great. We went to the Renaissance Fair last Saturday...and he told me he loved me for the first time...when we got back we posted all of our pictures together and everything was good. \n\nFast forward to last night, we were talking about past relationships we'd been in...and we must've said boogeyman too many times or something, cause the ex we were talking about in particular, unblocked and sent a friend request to my boyfriend on every platform. Which she's had a pattern of doing...like every 4 or so months from what he's told me...some back story for them is they've been broken up for almost a year...she cheated on him and dumped him as he was getting on a plane to go home. (They were together 7 months?)\n\nSo he accepted her requests to see what she wanted..and she came out saying how pretty she thought I was and how she is excited for him to have found someone and that he deserves all the love..\nWhich struck me as odd. But he told her he didn't really have anything to say to her, but she kept texting him ...and was talking about wanting to mend what was left of their relationship...and that they both messed up and can move passed what happened...and when he was telling her that's not what he wanted she just kept repeating \"oh you're a catch.\" \"I lost my chance\" \"no one has ever loved me like you did\" at that point I was getting pretty irritated...cause my boyfriend didn't wanna be mean to her...and tell her how it was. \n\nAt the end when he said he would rather go separate ways, she told him that she loved him...and that she always will. She said it a couple times and even used the phrase \"always and forever\"  \n\nAll in all...it makes me wildly uncomfortable...he doesn't wanna block her or be mean. And I don't have enough of a backbone to tell him he needs to block her...how do I get over the fear of being left for someone else? He told me he wasn't ever going back to her...but there's still that voice in my head that's scared about it. \nIt feels like she unblocked him...saw we were together ...and then decided to try and destroy what we've been building...she started out saying how happy she was ....and kept reiterating it to the point where she was like guilt tripping him for moving on. \nIt's so frustrating! My boyfriend and I havent talked about it since last night...and its just awkward! \nThis is more of a rant than anything...all thoughts and comments are appreciated. \n\nTLDR:MY boyfriends ex saw us post pictures together and reached out ...acting nice as pie...and then slowly started guilt tripping him for moving on, and then told him that she will love him always and forever...my boyfriend doesnt wanna be blunt/mean nor does he wanna block her..and it's caused alot of internal turmoil for me!",

        "text": "I (M25) have been fighting with my girlfriend (F23) for 3 days. \n\nBack story:\nWe‚Äôve been together for 4 years and both have stable jobs. most fights would occur about once a month, last about an hour and we‚Äôd both get over it and be cuddling again. Each fight would be different and we would grow from it. We moved in together into a rental in October last year to take our relationship to the next level and I guess give it a test to see how strong we are and we‚Äôve adapted pretty well. \n\nRecently we‚Äôve been on the hunt to purchase our first home together seeing that we work well together and have similar goals. She recently has access to inheritance money and she wanted to put some of that towards a deposit for the home loan (we‚Äôve discussed that if anything were to go pear shaped she‚Äôd get that money back and are having a contract drawn). Through the process of getting a Pre approval we‚Äôve realised that we aren‚Äôt able to borrow the amount that we would like. This is due to me having a car and student loan. Her parents suggested that she pays the car loan off and that I pay her back monthly so on book I have less debt. At first I was reluctant but I agreed since we would be able to get a nicer home and she deserves to be in a nice home.\n\nTwo days ago we were sitting on the couch and she asked for a naked massage and specifically to massage her butt and honestly this turned me on a lot and I got my hopes up since this is usually our foreplay. Mid massage she turned around and said she wanted to pay off the loan and once she did I said thank you and told her I said it feels weird to be free from a loan. I told her that I‚Äôve never been in a position where I‚Äôve never had to bust my ass like this so I‚Äôm in debt to her. Playfully I said I‚Äôll start by doing the dishes. After I did the dishes we hugged and kissed a little and I asked for a handjob (since I was still turned on from before) and she said no and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry i came on too strong‚Äù she then laughed at me and said she can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd ask for that after what she just did for me. She also said that she was hoping I‚Äôd be more grateful. I apologised for my actions saying I should be able to do something nice without thinking it‚Äôs sexual and then said I promise I‚Äôm grateful because she‚Äôs not only helped me out she‚Äôs put us in a better position to buy a new home. We‚Äôve been back and forth with me apologising and her saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre sorry‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that you wanted sex it‚Äôs the lead up to it‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just cared about whipping it out of your pants‚Äù. \n\nYesterday we had the same fight, I asked what it would mean to her if roles were reversed and If I paid. She said ‚Äú I have a big day tomorrow at work I can‚Äôt be fucked answering your questions ‚Äù. I I asked again and She stated everything I said I was grateful for. I then said that‚Äôs exactly what I said and that I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful and sorry. She then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of these mind games‚Äù‚Äù I‚Äôm sleeping on the couch and I‚Äôm going to my parents tomorrow‚Äù. After I apologise and the fight seems to cool off a bit she says‚Äù it‚Äôs not the fact that you wanted to get some it‚Äôs the build up to it‚Äù and from there it starts again. I stepped out of the room I broke down crying not knowing what else I could possibly say. \n\nI‚Äôm lost and hurt and feel like I‚Äôm ruining this relationship. I don‚Äôt want this to be the end\n\n- apologies for how this is written, my mind is all over the place\n\n\nTL;DR me M25 and my girlfriend F23 have been fighting for 3 days now, I‚Äôve apologised multiple times but I feel I may be approaching things the wrong way",

Immediately it was rough. she tried way too hard to force friendships with several people way too quickly and made several people uncomfortable, including me. \n\nthe first shift I worked with her was one on one, me training her. she unprompted started telling me about how she has ASD, and talking about her trips in a psych ward. and she said \"I noticed the scars on your arm, you seem like someone who understands and gets it\" and it made me wildly uncomfortable. I had just been promoted to a role which included training, so I felt too insecure to really reprimand her and just went \"uuuuh I guess\" and tried moving on\n\nseveral days later she asked if I wanted to bring her a key to my apartment so she could come over to feed my cat during my upcoming vacation (convo she overheard, I never told her) despite my roommate. I was weirded out. tried telling her no and avoided her while being nice as I am with anyone at work, resulting in her following me around constantly. annoying, but I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt in being neurodivergent she didnt get this stuff is inappropriate\n\nwe dress up at work for halloween. my costume was a dress, cute but not something outrageous to wear to work. unprompted D tells me how great my ass looks in the dress. I am really non confrontational so I tried to brush it off. I didnt report her, despite two people in the room who also felt it was bizarre. that was a mistake\n\nin the months since D has done and said a lot of little things here and there that rub a lot of people the wrong way as far as the social climate at work. but as far as the work, she has also been caught lying after making a mistake to save face multiple times, inflating her past work experience, and doing things that result in poor patient care because she is so focused on herself. just one example being poking a poor cat over and over in the leg for a blood draw because she couldnt find the vein and getting upset when being told to stop and let someone more experienced do it to minimize stress to the cat. her not caring that patient care is the priority, not her ego\n\noff the clock after work in the back area I was chatting with two of my coworkers/friends. I mainly date men but have attraction to women. but Im just getting more comfortable with this and not sure if being labeled as bi fits me. anyways, was telling them about this lumberjack girl on YT and how into her arms I am. D was walking by and stops on the edge of our group but none of us acknowledged her. she then yells \"are you bisexual?\" I ignore her. she repeats the question, except louder. I ignore her again. she goes \"I knew it, I had a feeling you were bisexual. I could TOTALLY tell!\"\n\nAll of us just kind of gave her a \"what the fuck\" look and she started going on about \"oh sorry!\" but I didnt respond and just left because it was weirdly upsetting to me. I know she has some level of ASD (I dont grill her about it though because I want to give her more respect than she gives me) and I feel horrible for being so frustrated and having such a strong dislike of her. I got home and just burst down crying and I dont know why. Grilling someone about how they label their sexuality just seems so universally wrong\n\nI am very close friends with my manager, so I vented to her over text. she told me that she backs me up 100% with it being wrong, but for anything to be \"done\", HR has to get involved and it's up to me. the two other people who were there want me to report as well. but to be completely honest, everyone at work has a pretty strong dislike of her, so Im not sure how objective that opinion is\n\nhow should I handle this? Is there realistically a way to resolve this without involving HR? am I a horrible person for having such a strong dislike of someone who probably cant help being the way they are?\n\nTLDR; coworker with ASD makes me really uncomfortable and I dont know what to do",

        "text": "Hey y‚Äôall. First time posting in here and starting to get in the swing of Reddit. This will be pretty long so here goes. Last year I (17m) moved to a new school after I moved in with my grandmother. Absolutely love the school, the people, and all my teachers. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself popular but I will say that I‚Äôm pretty known due to complications I had with people last year. There are a lot of pretty girls there and I‚Äôve dipped my toes into relationships with a couple of them but there was always this one girl that I just knew I wanted. She‚Äôs the typical pretty girl popular type but not in the bad way. She‚Äôs actually really nice and I‚Äôve spoken to her a few times. She‚Äôs a model and has guys drooling to even have a chance with her, rightfully so. Now, I‚Äôm not a bad looking kid. I‚Äôve had a significant glow up and my personality is pretty decent if you get to know me well enough so I believe if given the chance, I‚Äôd be able to succeed in making her my gf. I sit pretty close to her in class and each day when she walks in, I can‚Äôt help but just admire how beautiful she is. The problem is, she has a lot of guys that want her and it‚Äôs hard to get an opportunity to Talk to her. One day, (when I was still single), I got the courage to Talk to her and ask her on a date so I texted her to meet in the lunch room and she agreed. Well I found out she was talking to someone but I still put it out there that I would love to take her out if it doesn‚Äôt work out. Haven‚Äôt heard anything from her since then but from my understanding, she is still talking to them. In the past 3 months or so I started talking to someone through an app and we instantly clicked. We are pretty similar and I ended up taking her on a pretty expensive date. Needless to say I had a great time and ended up asking her to be my girlfriend on new years. Everything has been going great and our communication is amazing. She‚Äôs making me wait 6 months for sex but that doesn‚Äôt bother me much. Overall a pretty good relationship. Problem is, I often find myself dreaming about this other girl from school more than I‚Äôd like to admit and I can‚Äôt control it. And everytime she walks into class I can‚Äôt help but look. I have never cheated nor been cheated on and I plan to keep it that way but the thoughts of this other girl make me feel guilty. It sucks because I don‚Äôt know what to do about it but does anyone have thoughts?\n\nTL;DR: I have a mental obsession with a girl from school even though I have a girlfriend",

        "text": "\nlost a good friend\n\nThere was a girl I liked for a few years but was never in the right shape to talk to her. I'm gonna be straight up, I'm in college right now. When I finally had a class with her I decided it was the time to get better to talk to her. I wanted her so bad I started working out to atleast look better, I was fat before and lost nearly 40lbs. I mean, I was an atheist before and I wanted to talk to her so badly I started praying for an opportunity to talk to her, of course it was all in vain because i wasnt saved at the time. I never really went for anybody, I simply didn't have an interest in anyone but her. She's very introverted and quiet so I'm not really sure why she stood out so much. My brothers girlfriend got me and her to start talking finally but honestly I wasn't ready. The first week went great. We got to know eachother and would text everyday for about a week. We still texted a few days after but it slowed down as im sure she didn't want to talk 24/7. After about 3-4 weeks in she told me she didn't want a relationship with anybody, I didn't ask her out or anything, I think she didn't want to lead me on which was fine I could be patient, she said she wanted to be friends still. Then came 2 week Christmas break and I did the dumbest thing I could and texted her over break even though she didn't want a relationship. Of course she didn't answer. Since then I got a little pushy and asked things I shouldn't have because we were just friends. I thought she was mad at me when she wasn't and asked her over text and she said she wasn't mad and she's just introverted so prefers to be alone most of the time but it doesn't mean we can't be friends still. About a week after that I started seeing things a little more clearly and thought it would be best to slow it down, but I was too late. I asked her if we could talk on just 2 days a week. She said it was fine with her. Next day came and she wasn't there. At this point I think there's something wrong. I did another dumb thing and instead of just letting her be her and not interfering I just asked her where she was and said sorry if I'm being pushy, I just don't want to go back to being strangers again. Very weird thing to say to a friend I know. Then she told me verbatim \"I‚Äôm gonna be honest when I  first started talking to you I kinda felt a little pressured into being friends with you and I also heard there is a girl interested in talking to you but you don‚Äôt want to talk to her because of me and I don‚Äôt want to be the reason for that so I think it would be best if we stopped being friends because I don‚Äôt fully believe you when you say you understand when I tell you that I am not interested like that. I‚Äôm sorry.\"  I never talked to the other girl simply because I wasnt interested. She was right I didn't understand fully at the time. We were good friends, the conversations were nice, she stayed engaged. It was my first time ever trying with anyone so I didn't do the right things, I was too pushy. She was the nicest person I ever knew and I screwed it up. She had such a friendly smile and voice but now she just gives me the side eye, I don't think she necessarily hates me, I was never rude to her but I hate seeing her like that. More than anything I just want to tell her I'm sorry and ask her to forgive me. Which I think she could forgive me but I'm not sure if she'd give me another chance at being her friend. She wants to be left alone I'm sure but she helped me so much I can't let her go. I want to tell her im sorry but I'm afraid she wants to be left alone and I'd just lower her opinion of me if I told her. I don't know what to do. I thought I moved on at a time but I didn't. I couldn't ever forget her because of what she did for me even though unintentionally.\n\nTL;DR: Was good friends with someone and got too clingy  and pushy in the end. She left. I want to tell her im sorry.\n\nFor additional context we talked for exactly 2 months. Started on the 9th of November, ended on the 11th of January. About a month of that was two different breaks so it wasnt in person. I've now missed her longer than I've known her.",

        "text": "We were together more than 1.5 years. In the beginning, he came off as an amazing, successful, loving guy. We had a great time together. However, there are several issues: \n\n_He has a group of toxic friends (all in their 30s), who are rich, spoiled, mean, and condescending. All they do are spending their family money, party, do drugs. They tried to break up several couples in the past to show that they are powerful and can control other people's lives.¬† They tried to break my bf and I up as well. They ambushed him several times, called and pressured him everyday.¬† They gave him an ultimate \"break up with your gf or we won't be friends with you anymore\". They went as far as kidnap him and took his phone away from him, blocked me on everything, deleted our photos on social media, changed password of our shared streaming service. He is afraid of those people but he likes to be with them because he thinks they are elite. He took on a huge amount of debt (as much as other people¬† mortgage trying to keep up with those people.¬† After the kidnapping happened, I told him to distance himself from them because they are bullies. He did that for a bit, but getting right back to them after a few months. \n\n\n_He has a female friend (37F). Let's call her L. She lives in another state. She is bisexual. They knew each other for more than 10 year from the kink community. She liked him but he turned her down bc she isn't his type. However, they still have a very inappropriate relationship. They video called each other for hours everyday. He called her hun, texted her \"I love you hun. I missed you hun. I care about you hun.\" Etc... he hires her to work for him bc she doesn't make enough money for a living even though she is very incompetent, doesn't have any degree in the field and no experience. She got jealous and gave him an ultimatum \"break up with your gf or I won't be friend with you anymore\" when she knew the toxic friend group did that to put more pressure on him. She joined his therapy session, talked to the therapist and convinced her to tell him to break up with me. She had so much control over him, and he lost the ability to speak for himself. He said that he didn't know how he felt but she knew. She cried, yelled, threw a tantrum on the phone with him to force me to leave his place at certain time of her liking, forced him to cancel vacation with me (but he didn't), asked him to come visit her for 2 weeks right after our vacation so that he would miss my birthday, which he did. He came back after that, we made up. He distanced himself from her. They still talked, but less. Months later, he reversed back to his old way, hired her to work for him bc she is unemployed. She asked and he wrote her a fake letter of recommendation to make her a manager of his company so that she could find a job. \n\n\n_He has another female friend from high school.¬† Let's call her B (38F). They dated a few months back in high school but it didn't work out. They stay friend. B hates women. She said women are catty. She doesn't have any friend aside from him. She is jealous of her sister and doesn't have a good relationship with her mom. She hates her job and very unhappy in her relationship bc she pursued a guy for 5, 6 years but he didn't love her. She also has a big amount of debt from overspending.¬† My bf is her only friend. They call each other several times a day. Sometimes they talk for hours.¬† She hates my gut even though we never met and didn't have any interaction. I wanted to get to know her but she refused. She is very hostile towards me, threatens that if I ever reach out to her she would call the police. She sent my bf many selfies and photos of her, wanted him to send his photos back but specifically said that she just wanted to see photos of him and not photos of us together as a couple. She demands him to call her everyday or she would go crazy.¬† When I stayed at my bf's place for 9 days or so, of course he couldn't call her (only texted and emailed her behind my back), she went crazy and called his father to trash talked me and made a lot of false accusations towards me, saying I cut off all his friends and that I'm controlling and abusive. It's a huge lie bc we hung out with several friends of his and mine. The only friends I told him to distance himself are that toxic friend group and L and that's for good reasons. \n\n\n_He has depression and bipolar disorder. He is unstable and mentally weak. He is also a people pleaser and unable to set any boundaries. That's why he allow those people to walk all over him and over me. \n\n\n_His work ethic is horrible. He hates working, like spending. He has a huge amount of debt and his only hope is his parents would help him out because they are very wealthy. If not, he will have to move back home with his parents and file bankruptcy. \n\n\n_He isn't exactly a loyal type. He attempted to cheat on me in the past. He went to a kink party (which he lied to me and said he went to work). He met a kinky girl there, flirted with her, took her number and tried to set up a double date with another kinky couple but it didn't happen bc of schedule conflict. He hid the fact he was kinky from me in the beginning. I only figured out much later into the relationship. \n\n\n_He is a two-faced person. He lies a lot. When those toxic friends attacked and trash talked me behind my back, he didn't stand up for me but pretended to agree with them. They hate his former roommate, and he made fun of his roommate to entertain them. He isn't a man with integrity. He deleted texts and phone calls between him and L, him and B so that I wouldn't see them. When B trash talked me with him, he made himself a victim to get more sympathy and attention from her. He told me he couldn't stand up for me in front of those people because he is weak. When he distanced himself from L and the group of toxic friends that kidnapped him, he gaslit and blamed it on me that because of me he lost his friends. He said that he chose to be with me because he loves me but blamed it on me later. \n\n\n-The last 2 months of our relationship, he fully went back to the toxic friends, fully went back to L, still had no boundaries with B, went back to kink parties. He called me during the trip he took with the toxic friends crying, saying he loves me, misses me, and that he wishes he was with me and not with them.¬† He asked me to be patient with him because he was going through a very hard time. I was very confused. \n\n\n-I tried my best to help him out with his business and his mental health, convinced him to go see a psychiatrist for his depression and bipolar disorder and the medication really helps with his mood swing. Still, he went back to his old ways. \n\n\n-I decided to talk to his father about all the issues so that his father can take care of him. I could no longer see myself being in this relationship. It took a toll on me. He gave me an ultimatum to never talk to his parents or his friends (He lied too much and afraid the truth will come out if I talk to them). I met his parents before and have a really good relationship with them until B called his father lying about me, smearing my name. I don't know how it was handled. I can't trust a word that come out of my bf's mouth. Talking to his father gave me the closure I needed. He was really mad that I talked to his father.¬† We broke up after that, which is fine. It's for the best. I deserve better! \n\n\n- I do miss him. We shared a lot of good memories. The bad was really bad but the good was really good. I hope I made the right decision to leave. \n\n\nIs it just me or his \"friendship\" with L and B is very abnormal?\nWhat do you think about those toxic friends? About him and the situations? What would you do if you were me?\nHe completely hid the \"friendship\" with L and B from me in the beginning.¬† I figured it out much later after getting into the relationship. \n\n\nTdlr: bf has many toxic friends that tried to ruin our relationship and he has very inappropriate friendship with female friends.",

        "text": " Hey Reddit,\n\nMe and my ex are both in high school, I'm a senior and she's a junior. Recently, over a very heart felt (and heart-breaking) half hour talk in her car, she told me that even though I had been the sweetest person she had ever met and that I had been the best boyfriend she ever had, she couldn't deal with a relationship right now due to stress and anxiety, ending a month-long relationship. I've been through a break-up before but this one has hit me hardest in the gut because I made such a strong connection with her so quickly. Her reasoning makes sense as she's in band, she does rowing, she is always stressed and anxious about school work, and all the other things she's involved in. What I want to get across here is that it makes sense, and I respect her decision. I can see how much she cares for me, because if not, she wouldn't have told me about this problem. However, I'm a little confused on where to go from here.\n\nMutually, we made sort of agreed to meet up again sometime in the future when she was not as stressed or loaded down with work, as we're probably going to the same college. However, right now, we still remain friends. Usually, I'll see her once a day in the hallway and talk to her about this or that. I'm not sure this is mentally healthy for me, even if it does bring solace to my mind. The question in my head is that, should we completely break it off or should we remain connected because we agreed we were going to eventually bring it back together in the future? I'm concerned about how this will effect our healing processes if we see each other everyday.\n\nThis break-up hit hard and I'd be incredibly grateful for any and all advice. Thanks.\n\n TL;DR: High school senior (me) and junior (her) recently broke up due to the junior's stress and anxiety. Agreed to meet up in the future but remain friends for now, which may not be mentally healthy for me. I'm unsure whether to completely break it off or stay connected for the eventual reunion. Seeking advice on how to handle the situation.",

        "text": "Looking for some advice\n\nI am a 29 year old guy. My girlfriend is 25. We have been dating for almost 5 years and things are going well‚Ä¶ out of the bedroom.\n\nFor a little backstory, I was her first and was completely okay waiting for a bit. Well, we did it and have been semi regularly for years. Being her first, I fully understood and am okay with the fact that some things may take longer to be open to or be willing to try if she wasn‚Äôt comfortable. I have been very very accommodating and have never forced her into anything and always verbally ensure she is okay with what we are doing or planning on doing.\n\nHere‚Äôs where my issue lies. Not once in these 5 years has sex been initiated by her. Not once has any of the fantasies or desires that I have expressed ever played out. It‚Äôs taking a toll on me emotionally and in our relationship. I have tried every way under the sun to initiate as well as to initiate conversation about this. She gets very uncomfortable talking about sex in general. I‚Äôve tried in person, FaceTime, and texting to see if we could have more of a deeper conversation regarding this (both about the issue and to initiate sex itself)\n\nWe recently had a real sit down conversation regarding this and how to move forward. She told me she does get nervous at the thought of initiating. I fully understand this and have explained many times that it‚Äôs important to me and how I feel our connection. I also said the literal only time I can actually imagine saying no would be in the 5 minutes following a personal disaster.. think someone dying. She also mentioned that she enjoys our sex when we are in the middle of stuff, but never gets horny or turned on in the slightest until she‚Äôs in the middle of it. This seems to explain the never initiating portion. She‚Äôs even gone as far as saying that she in general is not a very sexual person, doesn‚Äôt tend to think about it, and has never tried any solo fun with herself either. Basically she could go her whole life without sex, while I am sitting here wanting her to initiate once and a while, want to have more adventurous sex, and just want to have more sex in general. \n\nJust as a side note, she doesn‚Äôt really reject my advances in person, but I am feeling pretty undesirable after being never the one to have it initiated with them, and the fact that things I want to try just get left on the table.\n\nOur short term fix is for me to initiate MORE sex so maybe she will feel a bit more comfortable initiating, but this feels like bandaid at best right now.\n\nHave any of you ever been in this situation or have any advice about moving forward?\n\nI just love her so much, don‚Äôt want to hurt her, but also embrace the fact that as a human, I need my needs met as well.\n\nTL;DR: long story short, our sex drives are different and we have talked but are trying to find a way to push forward",

My girlfriend isn't the most openly affectionate person, however, and this is also the case for how often she says she loves me. I'm used to affectionate girlfriends and I often hear how loved up couples say I love you a lot. We just don't do that.\n\nWe're long distance so we often only voice call and chill together. When we're together in person I can tell she loves me (even if she still doesn't say it too much), but when we're apart she typically won't say she loves me unless I say it first.\n\nI can honestly count how often she says it first. Before we met for the first time in person she was the first person to say \"I love you\". I didn't say it back because I wasn't ready, but once I was I have been good at telling her I love her.\n\nSeveral months after she first told me she loved me she told me she cried that evening because I didn't say it back. Once I did start saying it myself we both said our I love yous at a decent rate. Then we met in person for the first time, both showed our love in many ways, and then I returned home.\n\nI've since visited her again, and we're having a third trip to a neutral country very soon, but since after I returned home from the first trip I've heard her say \"I love you\" literally four times on her own accord. Once after we watched a movie, and three times in 4 days when I returned home after Christmas. Since then, she's reverted back to type. She did say she loved me on our anniversary 5 days ago, but again I said it first.\n\nIs this just nothing to worry about? Is it even normal? She still talks about vacations together next month, in 4 months time, and when I next visit her country (whenever that could be), so should I assume things are still good?\n\n**TL;DR: girlfriend rarely says I love you first.

We saw each other every week and even had trips together. He eventually had to go back to his hometown in the west coast after our third date. We kept in touch every day, even though we didn't see each other for almost two months.\n\nIn January, things got pretty serious when he flew from the west coast to the east coast just to be with me for ten days. We did all kinds of relationship stuff. But this was also the time when he also told me that he was still talking to a girl he had gone on dates with last November. That was fine with me because we never had the DTR talk until he visited me. He assured me that they were just friends and that he already \"broke up with her\" before flying in to see me. So I brushed it off. \n\nWe became exclusive a month after, but decided to hold off on making it official until we knew which state we'd end up in (since I just recently graduated and would have to move). Now that it's March, and that we know we'll end up in different states, we decided to end things. It was the most mature and amicable break up. \n\nBut what's bothering me is that he stopped initiating conversations with me. It's hard for me to understand why he continued to talk to her every day even after they had the \"break up talk\" back in December, but stopped talking to me right after we split. I have a feeling that he might pursue her now that we're done. \n\nI understand that it is none of my business now and that they are free to do what they want. But it makes me wonder why he did all of those things for me while he was still in contact with her everyday (even as friends) and if he ever enjoyed my company as much as he did hers. \n\nI'm struggling to move on because I lost someone who I know would be the best boyfriend. I'm jealous of the girl because I know he'll treat her as special as how he did to me. Should I even bring it up to him and ask him for my own peace of mind? Any advice on how to get over him would be appreciated. \n\nThank you.\n\nTLDR: Met a great guy, did all kinds of relationship stuff, but he still talked to a girl he had gone on dates with (but he told me they broke up in December). We became exclusive in February, but held off on making it official until we knew which state they'd end up in. Decided to end things amicably in March. However, he stopped initiating conversations with me after the breakup, which makes me sad  because he continued talking to the girl even when they \"broke up\" last December.",

        "text": "One of my good friends of 20+ years stopped talking to me about something I did. She is a journalist working on a project for a while. I have decent computer skills. Last week she sent me some photos and asked if I could blur the faces on those photos and I said totally. Her project was due on Monday. I actually did half of it but then I got busy with work. Last week has been crazy for me, my work picked up (it includes a lot of fieldwork) and I had family visiting so I had to rush to the hotel we were all staying after work. \n\nOn top of everything I got pretty sick. So I totally forgot, no excuses. To make it worse, she sent me a reminder on Saturday but I was driving the family around and my googlemaps was on, so I ended up not seeing the message. I know I messed up and these are all excuses but this is the situation. As soon as I realized it on Monday, I texted her to apologize and asked if she still have time to submit it. She never answered. I tried calling the next day and she hung up - I texted her asking if everything was alright. She said that she doesn't want to talk to me because this project was very important to her, those photos were critical and I didn't even have the courtesy of letting her know that I was rude and irresponsible. I replied by apologizing again but also told her that nothing like this ever happened in the past, so it is unfair of her to blame me for being irresponsible and rude without giving me the benefit of the doubt - I actually did stuff for her similar to this often in the past and always delivered on time. I tried calling/texting a couple more times but never got a response. I feel pretty bummed but she is not talking. I know I messed up but do you think I messed up royally? Is there a way to salvage this or should I give her space?\n\nI should also mention that we had some disaggrements in the past. The biggest one being about her not reaching out to me when my mom was on a ventilator for 3 months when she had covid. She knew about the situation but never called, she was in a new relationship. I eventually told her that I was hurt and she called and apologized profusely. I actually gave her the opportunity to apologize and make it up. We eventually moved forward. We have an ongoing issue of me feeling that our friendship is one sided. I always reach out to her, when I visit my hometown (I live abroad), I always go to her to visit. So this giving me the silent treatment makes me question a lot of stuff about our friendship. Am I only useful when I do stuff for her? Am I that easy to cut off? What do you think reddit? Is it worth trying to salvage this?\n\nTL;DR! I said that I would do something for my friend and totally forgot. Now she is not talking to me.",

I‚Äôve gone on a few first dates but unfortunately that never led to anything more.\n\nBefore, I would try to meet a girl (through hobbies, class, etc.) and talk to them. I followed the general Reddit advice of letting your intentions be known upfront and not try to pretend to be friends first. I would have a conversation and then invite them to coffee. If coffee goes well I invite them on a formal date. They have always said no.\n\nMy therapist says I am rushing into it too fast and that I need to slow down and let feelings develop overtime. This really confuses me because it seems to go against the ‚Äúupfront‚Äù approach Reddit proposes so much. He seems to suggest being friends and seeing if things develop further, but not asking them on a direct date right away.\n\nIs he right? Should I try to just be friends first and not ask them on a date so soon? I mean, the direct approach hasn‚Äôt been working for me so well\n\nTLDR: I have tried to be direct and upfront with my intentions when asking girls out, but my therapist tells me to slow down and let feelings develop over time.

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 7 months now. He is a very sweet, kind, and caring person; I really want to make this work.\n\nThere is a common issue in our relationship where on his end, he believes he tells me details about things (e.g. when a lunch with his family will be, when his family is coming over, etc.), but on my end, I'm always blindsided with the details. I find it odd because I am a very time-sensitive person and put everything into my calendar as soon as I hear about things. I feel like he thinks he tells me, but doesn't, and tries to convince me that he did. On the other hand, he feels like I forget everything he tells me. It's problematic because we feel like the other is trying to \"gaslight\" the other when I know that on both our ends, we firmly believe that the other person is forgetting.\n\nTo provide some background, I have anxiety and he has ADHD. I don't really want to blame his ADHD for forgetting to tell me things; however, the reason why I feel it may be a contributing factor is because my mom has ADHD and is very forgetful when it comes to sharing important details or updates about things. Even if it *is* his ADHD, I don't know how to bring it up respectfully without offending him. I do want to note that sometimes my mind is frazzled and not super present all the time because I'm always overthinking about my busy/overworked schedule.\n\nI know there is a communication issue somewhere, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I am going crazy because I've always been very detail-oriented when it comes to scheduling, but my boyfriend makes me feel like I'm forgetful. I will often remember both my boyfriend's and my appointments (I felt really anxious when he forgot his last hair appointment), where his belongings are in his apartment, and feel this nagging feeling like I have to help him \"manage\" his life due to the amount of anxiety I feel about him forgetting things.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\ntl;dr Am I the gaslighter or the gaslit?",

        "text": "So my boyfriend (M28) and I (F23) have been together for almost three years. We're both very adventurous and spoke early about opening things up. However we have only just begun adding in partners.  \nI have had one experience with him watching, and one other failed attempt. He was supposed to meet a girl alone before this, but we got into a fight (I was just starting my period and it ended up being really bad timing, I was too emotional in general), and the second girl was for a threesome. She ticked all the physical boxes, but we had a ft and I didn't gravitate to her, although I was still open to doing it.  \nI don't know if this is an issue though? Do i need to like the girl particulary? I don't always need to like the man im playing with...  \nI spoke to my boyfriend about this, but he was really ready to shut it down. He is worried I will feel bad etc. which I totally understand, but I think on some level I just need a bit of a push to get going (I had some concerns before we did things the other way around too).  \nI also feel like maybe he's not saying how he feels incase he hurts me, he's very sensitive to my feelings, but I also want to make sure he's happy!  \nHis conclusion that night was that we wasn't being open anymore, and he said he wanted to close the relationship. Since, we have discussed that we could do things in a more organic manor, and sort of not put much emphasis on it for now...  \nThis was good for me, and a few days later I deleted the chat messages I had with the other guy wee successfully saw.  \nIm very curious about playing with other girls, and open to anything my partner wants to indulge in. However I feel really bad that I have not been into the most recent girl and the timing issue with the girl before. I feel like im letting him down and not being a good partner. I want him to be happy and enjoy himself, that gives me joy (and turns me on)! And we haven't had any of these kinds of issues with him, although he did say with some of the male options I had that he wasn't interested in them, but it was before a ft call etc.\n\nToday he asked me if I still had the guys number and if I wanted to message him. I said I didn't, but I could find it if he wanted to still do this. He said he would like to if I would. I did enjoy what we did together, but it wasn't a massively significant point in my life. My conclusion was that it was just a different sexual experience, I thought it would feel more... naughty/ bad? I'm happy in my relationship, and I enjoy that my partner gets something out of this dynamic. I do too, I mean its just sex for me, that my partner gets a lot out of. But I'm not sure why he wants to keep doing this when he was quite adamant about closing the relationship up (I never said it). I think nows a good time to mention that the focus was on me sleeping with other men in the first place. He was interested in that and I was too, however he felt that it would be unbalanced if he wasn't able to too (which I was totally fine with and curious about). It was all a very exciting fantasy at first.  \nSo is it fair to conclude he enjoys this mostly?\n\nSO heres a few summary questions\n\n\\- Do I need to really like the girl?  \nWhat I've learnt from this is that its a different game for men and women.  \nIm a girl that doesn't need connection for sex and some men dont either (i dont want to generalise), so the process of hooking up is quite straight forward.  \nIm not huge into texting these men, so again it's not massively a thing in regards to connecting.  \nA little bit of sexting and photos sporadically. My boyfriend LOVES this btw... It turns him on a lot!\n\nFor him it seems to have been quite different.  \nHe likes to connect (in general), and it seems that most girls like to have a bit of connection too. So he has been building up these connections, chatting more regularly.  \nThe girl we FT he wanted to pick up and have drinks first... but in some ways i see this being part of his communication style? And this girl seemed to be like that herself. She was also very into me and exploring her bi side.  \nI saw their messages and was totally fine with this, but I just didn't gravitate to her on the call. I don't think we'd be friends in real life, but that would be the same with some men ive been with, so does it really matter? Plus I was happy to go forward, he wasn't.  \nI think he wanted me to be more friendly with the girl, which made sense, but I didn't expect it from him. Again different dynamic though, right?\n\n\\- Should I push him to explore with girls a little more?  \nI really discussed with him after that I still want to do it, im really curious, but he seemed to have made his decision.  \nIt's almost as though, because I don't get the same thing out of it he isnt happy. I think thats a little unreasonable, as its not exactly the same [thing](https://thing.do/). Do I just need to be a little more accommodating and encouraging, so he feels good about doing it? I dont want it to be the things im doing/ saying thats making him feel bad.  \nOr do you think that maybe he's much more into the other stuff and not really into this as much, but just wants to keep it even. He said himself it's a lot of work with girls. He feels he has to host and keep everyone happy. That is feeling a little stressful for him.\n\nOpen relationships are hard... they require a lot of communication lol! Any insight would be great x  \n\n\nTL;DR! - what should I do about my boyfriend wanting to close the relationship, yet still wanting me to see other men?",

Because of all of these things we decided not to have s*x for a little while and to focus on us. \n\nUnfortunately one night when we were hanging out he was sending shirtless pictures of himself to a guy right in-front of me and I flipped and got extremely hurt.  He ignored me for days because he said I should‚Äôve brought it up in the moment and I shouldn‚Äôt blow up on him . I do wanna say that he told me that he had his options open. I told him that I can‚Äôt keep hanging around him if he doesn‚Äôt wanna focus on me. He agreed and I forgave him. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I asked if he has been intimate with that other guy and he said he has been for a month. To be perfectly honest I would‚Äôve respected him more if he told me he was gonna pursue this other guy but he straight up lied to me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do I like him a lot, and he keeps reaching out but he hasn‚Äôt even tried to apologize or anything.

He was also involved in a strange situation with a 48-year old divorced woman who also lives in the complex....this fact really weirded me out and made me uncomfortable. However, he kept being persistent about it and I like to be pursued (and honestly had a slight crush on him) so I ended up caving eventually and agreeing.\n\nThe date went super well minus the fact that said 48 year old flipped out at him for taking me out and tried to sabotage our date. I ended up really liking the guy, but I could not deal with that, so I ended things with him and told him she was the reason why. He was understanding about it, but a little upset still, and I was upset because as I said, I ended up liking the guy. I deep down had hoped he would cut things off with her and try to make it work with me (since he was romantically interested in me), and because I know he wants to get married and have kids eventually.\n\nBut instead, he went right back to her, and now is flaunting it in my face basically (she is as well). I am very hurt and upset by this and I don‚Äôt know what to do. When I initially ended things, I told him if I saw them together it would be weird for me, which he understood, but when I confronted him about what he was doing, he acted dumb and said I ‚Äúfriendzoned‚Äù him, and he wasn‚Äôt going to apologize for ‚Äúmaking up‚Äù with this woman. I don‚Äôt want this to bother me but it does, it makes me feel like I meant nothing now. I know it was very short, and I was the one who ended things, but I did actually feel a connection too, so this has just been a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : I am in an uncomfortable situation because of going out with my neighbor and I need advice",

A day later, my partner sat me down and read me a letter in which they spell out that they accept that I am asexual, but that not having physical intimacy makes them feel very distant from me. They listed a number of issues with the relationship - that we don't spend enough time together, go on dates, engage in physical intimacy, and that they feel that I generally don't 'pull my weight' in the relationship - and then they set out that while they're not presenting me with an ultimatum, that these things need to change for our marriage to continue. My partner also revealed that they have been seeing a therapist secretly for months, that they talk to their therapist about me and about our relationship, and that their therapist doesn't seem to like me.\n\nIn response, I talked a little more about how physical intimacy is difficult for me, but that now that we were on the same wavelengh about sex being off the table, that engaging in it might seem a lot less daunting to me.

On the other hand, I think the reality is that I'm just not the person I was when we got together, and frankly I don't really think I'm the partner they really ought to have. I don't mean like I have these big shortcomings that I could fix - I think we're just less compatible people now than we were back then.

        "text": "I (22F) am dating a 31M. We met in November of 2022 and went to a gig together, and then to a bar with his friends after but we had a great date that ended up lasting the whole weekend. To clarify we are both not dating anyone else. For Christmas, I got him a print designed by a local artist of that very first bar we went together, but he actually didn‚Äôt realise where or what the bar was because he was so drunk and stoned. \n\nFast forward to March 2023 and we are still dating. We meet almost every weekend, have dates, and went away together in January to see my friends and for another concert. We barely had sex for the whole weekend and he kept going soft during sex, an issue that we never experienced beforehand.\n\nThis issue persisted into February where he kept going soft during sex and one night he said he felt I should be with someone more sexually compatible. He opened up about feeling insecure as I never cum during sex and he thought this meant I wasn‚Äôt enjoying it and faking it.\n\nAs a partner, I‚Äôm very selfless and reassuring and will invest any amount of energy into convincing someone otherwise when it comes to their own insecurities. It worked and our sex life essentially is back on track, but he occasionally still goes soft during sex as he still overthinks. I‚Äôm starting to feel a little burnt out.\n\nDespite all of this, I recently realised that I love him and have never felt so infatuated with someone. He said that being in a relationship is a very serious step for him as he has previously been hurt and cheated on in the past. Initially, I was understanding of this and was happy to go at his pace as I couldn‚Äôt be more comitted to the man and open about my feelings, but he treats me like his girlfriend without the commitment.\n\nHowever, I went to Berlin with a friend and wanted clarity on what we were before going, he essentially told me his ex had cheated on him there and I was a ‚Äúfree agent‚Äù in Berlin and could do anything I wanted. I felt so hurt by this because once again, he reminded me that a relationship is a big commitment and very serious to him and implied he wasn‚Äôt ready, right after I had literally told this man I wanted to be with him and loved him. I couldn‚Äôt give more to this man if I tried.\n\nIn a drunk rage at KitKat and a big chat with a man I‚Äôll never meet again about everything above, I ended up having sex with him in the bathrooms. I don‚Äôt feel guilty for it because we aren‚Äôt in a relationship (as reminded). I feel like I deserve more but I‚Äôm also TA for sleeping with someone else incase he was ‚Äútesting‚Äù me.\n\nTDLR; Slowly losing patience and growing tired and burnt out of waiting for this man to become comitted to me. He says a relationship is a serious step but has a trip booked away with me, has met my friends, and is overly publicly affectionate and treats me like his girlfriend.",

        "text": "This past weekend, my boyfriend (33m) told me (28f) about an old friend that ‚Äúrecently‚Äù came back into his life. He used to be in love with this girl, but she didn‚Äôt want him romantically. While telling me about it, I told him I‚Äôve had similar situations occur where people from my past come back around and how timing is weird, etc. Basically I tried to relate to his situation and reassured him that life is weird. We had this conversation as he drove.  After reaching our destination, we didn‚Äôt talk about it again. We watched a show and cuddled on the couch. At around midnight, he got a text and I asked him who it was. He said it was the girl (the old friend), so I asked what she said, since it was around midnight on Saturday. He instantly got weird and hid his phone. I remember being weirded out and asking him, but he literally hid the phone in his pockets. \n\nAfter arguing about it for a while, with me asking why he was afraid to show me, he finally agreed and showed me. I went into his recently deleted messages and there were 34 messages deleted, all with her. I recovered them and read the conversation, all with him next to me. Honestly, the conversation wasn‚Äôt THAT bad, aside from some comments about him feeling pressured to propose, sending a Valentine‚Äôs Day msg, her asking him what he looks for in a partner, etc. \n\nIf that had been the end of the story, I wouldn‚Äôt be making this post. Like I said, the texts themselves weren‚Äôt that bad. However, it continued to be weird after that. I felt hurt that he would delete texts and try to hide anything from me. He also lied about when they started talking again. He said it was a few weeks ago, but it‚Äôs actually been since September, which is early into when we started talking.\n\nFast forward through a restless night, we were driving again the next day. During the ride, I asked him to block her - not necessarily because of their messages, but because he felt the need to delete texts / hide it from me, and also to see if he would make a fuss about blocking her (if so, why?)\n\nHe said no and that I was being controlling. That response honestly told me a lot. After a whole day or arguing and going back and forth, I decided to text her. I apologized for messaging her, but told her I just wanted to know if there was anything between them before I get engaged to this person. She said no and basically told me they‚Äôre just friends who talk periodically. I felt reassured and thought maybe we would be able to move forward.\n\nHowever, he keeps insisting that it was controlling of me to ask him to block her. He says the people of Reddit agree. The issue is, he‚Äôs making it out to be like he told me about an old friend and I instantly told him to block her. He‚Äôs missing the whole deleting texts part. \n\nI have never texted a boyfriends ex or friends, so I also feel weird about doing that. However, I feel like I was pushed to that point. Like I said, I didn‚Äôt even bring it up or ask her name or anything after he told me about her initially. It was only after he started being weird and dodgy after she texted him at midnight, and after I discovered he had deleted their messages. \n\nI‚Äôd be grateful to hear your thoughts and opinions.\n\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend tried to hide messages with an old friend / crush of his. I texted her and asked her if there was anything between them.",

        "text": "So we've been dating for 9 months. Has been great. I was actually planning on proposing later this year. Normally, we communicate great. We've never had a fight or even an argument that got heated. But then this came along...\n\nShe planned a birthday weekend getaway for me this past weekend. She cancelled it because of weather. We went from big weekend plans to her going to a show with her mom Saturday. Sunday morning we texted normal morning hellos. Then I asked her when was a good time to come over. She said I needed to figure out what we were doing. The tone of her text felt a little aggressive. I came up with an idea that she shot down. I  ended up going to her place and in person she attacked me with a pretty stern tone saying \"you don't ever make plans for us. It's always me doing all the work.\" I wasn't expecting this. She's never came at me like that. I shut down. We ended up not talking for like an hour, when she suggested I go home. I went home. A couple hours later realized I handled that poorly. I texted her that I was sorry about shutting down like that and explained to her that I felt attacked. She texted me back a few lines, nothing that suggested she was angry/upset about what happened earlier.\n\nMonday I worked so we didn't see each other. Usually on my off days during the week we hang out after she gets off work. I texted asking what time I should come over. She responded with something like \"I'm really upset right now and need time to process. Tonight isn't a good night for you to come over.\" I sat on that for a bit then let her know if she was upset then we should talk sooner rather than later. She said she understood.\n\nFast forward to today. I hadn't heard a thing from her. Early afternoon I tried calling and left her a voice mail voicing my desire to talk today. I left an ultimatum there saying we needed to talk today. In hindsight that was probably the wrong move. She called me back and there was a lot of yelling/arguing. Eventually we went silent and ended the call. This was the first time I've ever heard her upset. Ever. I texted her a couple angry things after the call. Honestly things that did not belong in text. I then realized those were mistakes if I wanted this relationship to continue and basically poured my heart out in the final text.\n\n*my big frustration is that we've never fought. Not even close to it. And suddenly she's too upset to see me or even talk to me. I had no idea what was going on. My mind went off the deep end and assumed the worst and it made me incredibly anxious. She told me she needed time. I get that...but days? It isn't like I deliberately wronged her in some awful way. I didn't even know what was wrong. In the past when I've seen sudden behavior shift like this it meant the person was cheating both times. I don't think she would do that, but I believe her mind was made up before we talked at all today. At one point today her text read **\"if we talked yesterday I was so angry I probably would've broken up with you\"** am I wrong in being hella suspect about that statement? I had never once considered that...and this is where she was going? Ready to break up?*\n\nI texted some things after our call that were not good. I asked her when I could come pick up my stuff. I assumed at that point she was done. Then I doubled back and poured my heart out in the final text that she hasn't responded to. She put me at such a point of anxiety/anger for not even letting me know what was going on.\n\n**Tldr; girlfriend verbally attacked me, then took days to \"resolve\" her feelings. I forced them today and we probably broke up. But not sure.**",
