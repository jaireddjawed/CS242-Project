        "text": "I like star trek and sci-fi and that’s why I went to school for astronomy.  \n\nThrough undergrad and a bit into my graduate program, it was mildly scoffed at to suggest we are being visited by extraterrestrials.  I took part in the culture too.  The probability is low, the evidence isn’t there, the distances are astronomical, etc.   Those who go down the pseudoscience path of warp drives and dimensional travel as overcoming these obstacles are then seriously told that this isn’t science.  And this is absolutely correct.\n\nBut here is the deal.  The phenomenon is real.  It’s unexplained at the moment, but it’s real.\n\nBruce Greyson turned me a little to the phrase “you can’t ignore that the phenomenon exists”.    So, study it.  Don’t “answer” it, just get data.\n\nPeople still claim to see unexplained phenomena- and let’s focus on Ariel phenomenon.  Granted that 99% are prosaic but there are unexplained observations left.  Some with good data from multiple observations that aren’t just eyeballs.\n\nThere aren’t many armature radar flight tracking stations unfortunately, and that best tech are state secrets.  For good reason.\n\nI am asking the true, skeptical, analytical, sane scientists out there to forget about the huge lazy leap from “unexplained” to “alien”.   Let’s assume: \n\n1. there are reasonable, disciplined people who don’t make that leap, and \n\n2. good data exists on arial and near-space phenomena that is still unexplainable.\n\nI’m more towards #2 being a bad assumption than #1 myself.   I’m not going to spend hours on every cosmic ray I get on my CCD images or every 10-sigma data point thinking it’s new science.  \n\nI’m so damn biased that anyone who claims to see a UFO I can explain it.  I started r/IFOs to document the absolute best, rare, interesting phenomena that are not aliens or “non terrestrial technology”\n\nI find it fascinating and fun to identify unknown phenomena in the sky because the journey is the fun.  The learning is fun.   I wouldn’t have studied and worked in astronomy if I didn’t feel this way.\n\nSo, all I’m asking for is agreement that a phenomenon of unidentified objects is happening.  Time and data will tell what it is.\n\nBut none of us should neither accept OR dismiss extra terrestrial tech out of hand.\n\nThe bar is extremely high for this proof, but military secrecy is extremely tight around technology, so I’m not going to dismiss anything.\n\nIf there really is no dragon in that garage, then what was that growl I heard a few years ago and why did that bush mysteriously burn down?    It’s explainable somehow…. a dragon discovery would be cool too…. But bears and loose cigarette butts also exist.    Neither is proven, just one theory is more likely than the other.",
