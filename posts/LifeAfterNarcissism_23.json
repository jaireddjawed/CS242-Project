Otherwise people wouldn't want to play them.\n\nAnd **my motivation system for my life was \"designed\" to be an outlet for my nfathers moods, not to benefit MYSELF**, and due to his need to rage a lot, my mood was to be depressed a lot.\n\nBut that piece of knowledge somehow didn't \"click\", still.\n\nThen I imagined - what would happen **if my ndad would be here and make it one of his goals to supervise and instruct me on this one smartphone game**?\n\nIt was fascinating how, in the matter of literally one second, a dark cloud hung over the formerly happy bubble-popping smartphone game and an immediate feeling of disgust and unwillingness and hopelessness came across.\n\nBut HERE, **the dysfunction was so sudden, clear, and obvious** (because there is truly NO NEED to feel depressed and unhappy about this game, it is MERELY a DISADVANTAGE), that I could apply this to my real life - reversed, and thought \"**why not celebrate every little achievement** (making myself breakfast, washing clothes, tidying up) at the moment - seems to work in the computer game, and not \"make me lazy\" like my ndad claimed \"too much rewarding\" would do, but in fact work well?\". I was also anxious because I had been taught that if I don't follow my father's mindset, I would \"fail in life\", but seen as that was already kinda happening, I thought I might just as well risk the \"other method\".\n\nAnd here I am, seeing the next washload as a quest, and it kind of works at the moment :D",

I’m an assistant to a person who unknowingly mimics my NParent (&gt;2years NC) and constantly brings up feelings of shame and worthlessness. \n\nI’ve tried to bring it up to them in order to get them to stop, and have even began to stand up for myself (!!!) but it never lasts. \nThey also confusingly tell me they love me and want to be best friends with me. It’s not weird for her to want to be close with me as that kind of relationship in our industry can only strengthen our professional growth, however I want nothing to do with her outside of work because of her manipulative tendencies. \n\nShe’s always triggering awful feelings in me from years ago, and while she is not my NParent, nor is she as bad, interacting with her is definitely unhealthy for me. Since becoming her assistant I have gained tons of weight and have recently began to have near-constant headaches, but only when I’m at work, and only when she is in the office – so they’re very clearly stress headaches.\nI desperately need a healthier, safer work situation, I need to be somewhere that I am not  manipulated and demeaned daily, but I have no idea how to convey this sense of  urgency to my employer.  \n\nI let them know months and months ago that I no longer wish to be her assistant and am open to a different office location entirely, but they’ve let me know that there are no assistant openings at the moment. I understand that and am trying to be patient, but this is really killing me. \n\nI vaguely thought that maybe if I were to disclose the severity of the relationship’s effects on my psyche that they would handle my situation with a little more urgency, but I also feel that revealing this information might be inappropriate as I’m not sure what it would mean to management. \n\nI’ve been researching different companies out of desperation but I love this company and it would feel so unfair to have to downgrade just to escape my “NParent” once again. \nHas anyone been in this situation before? What are your thoughts? \n",

I have been a victim of N abuse and had gone no contact for a year.\n\nI'll try to keep things short. This new friend, who is having some stressful time in his marriage, confides in me because he feels lonely. Well, it's great, I don't mind since I need a friend too. At first it was pretty innocent conversations, he was nice and patient, then he would tell me sexual things but I'd always steer the conversation to something else. Somehow, every time we talked, he managed to add in some sexual references, such as he liked looking at girl's panties, or sent some dogs masturbating/mating. \n\nI never had many male friends, so I don't know if this is a male thing? Is this a friendly conversation? He did tell me at the start that if he had met me earlier I might be his wife in real life. It felt weird. \n\nHe got me really uncomfortable and as I am still recovering from N abuse a year ago, I got triggered but I said nothing to him. Yesterday I finally asked him what he wanted from me. And he said I was thinking of nonsense and he didn't have any other motives. He said I was too sensitive (I did tell him I was sensitive before) and he felt guilty for making me upset and that he didn't sleep due to that. He said he didn't want to see me hurt again and that I should stop thinking nonsense. \n\nBut! I feel otherwise. He was telling me one thing then twist the entire context into my fault. That's what I am seeing. Can someone please tell me if I am right? Or am I being paranoid? I can't trust anyone. HALP!",

        "text": "1 October marked a whole year since DH and I drove to my NFOO's house and I read aloud a letter to my parents that had taken me a week to write. It described several recent incidents, as well as my feelings over the previous decade. I also repeatedly mentioned phrases like \"confusion\", \"heavy weight on my shoulders and I don't know why\", \"feeling smothered\" etc. \n\nDH and I chose this route because I felt it was the only way I could get the pent-up emotions out, without crying from repressed anger. We fully expected my mother to rage out (possibly even attack us), and for my father to cry or something.\n\nSo when NDad screamed at my husband to \"take his wife out of the house\" and \"so sorry I was the worst father in the world\", it was like my mind rebooted. I screamed back at Ndad for the first time in my scapegoated, compliant life.\n\nDH and I got out of there and I spent the next week analysing what had happened. I started googling around and discovered the concept of emotional abuse. Something was niggling in the back of my mind, so I followed the links to narcissistic abuse, then to NPD and covert narcissism.\n\nMy Awakening was swift - as I read article after forum post after blog post on the subject, I recognised my situation in all of them, and readily accepted the truth as it poured in:\n\n* My father was a covert narcissist\n* My mother was his enabler\n* I had been emotionally abused my entire life\n* My father was not who he said he was (good Christian man who loved his daughters more than anything)\n* My father projected all his bad qualities onto my mother, effectively destroying my relationship with her before it had a chance\n\nMost importantly, I realised that my father would never admit that he was at fault, and would never, ever change. Once that realisation dawned on me, my emergence from the FOG was complete.\n\nSo I was completely ready for the inevitable email from my father which arrived two weeks later. I got DH to screen it for me just in case, although I felt that I could handle it as I was armed with my newfound knowledge. I watched him get progressively angrier as he read through the mail, then I asked him to read it out loud to me.\n\nAs he went through it again, I called out the concepts as they appeared - gaslighting, outright lies, triangulation, rewriting history, denial, projection, non-apologies. Basically, it contained all the hallmarks of narcissistic abuse, which I've become very familiar with over the last year at RBN.\n\nReceiving a letter like that even a few weeks earlier would have sent me rushing back to the FOG, begging my father for forgiveness. Now that I was Awakened, I went Scorched Earth. I responded to that email with a scathing analysis of his words, ending it with NC and informing the rest of my FOO that I would be available to them to talk about things, but not to my father.\n\nOf course, I know now that I shouldn't have responded to that email, I should have just gone NC, but TBH it felt good. Ndad smeared me my whole life, it's not like the campaign was going to stop if I didn't respond. The fact that my older sister responded to my email with a few sentences about how she felt about it (and not asking me wtf was going on) and some other incidents over the last year made me realise that my older sister is the GC N, and my younger one is a FM N.\n\nI was going to include some more details about what happened when I confronted my parents, and a snippet from the email. I don't think I need to now. I've come so far in the year that has passed, that it feels like a distant memory now. My DH has been so supportive (he is RBN as well) and we have been make great progress on our life goals.\n\nWhile 1 year NC is officially at the end of the month, I am now viewing the month of October as a time of rebirth and transformation. I feel like I only truly became an adult a year ago (was heavily controlled by Ndad) and started discovering who I really am.\n\nThis post was not as eloquent as I had hoped, but I wanted to get it out there. I've been on RBN less and less over the last couple months, because I no longer need the constant validation that I did the right thing. I know it now.\n\nTo everyone who read this longass piece to the end - onwards and upwards.",

Which, of course, comes from the same weakness, just with an illusion of strength to cover it up.\n\nIt's kind of heartening to realize how outside validation, disapproval, and opinions are unimportant in a certain fundamental way.  What's important, the only real solution to the problem, is the foundation of self-validation. \n\nI know I'm not saying anything new, but this a really important issue for me. One I keep coming back to and need to remind myself of when I find myself feeling like a doormat or wanting to impress in order to feel respected. I need to stop, and stop looking outside myself. There's a kind of standing up for myself that isn't even about standing up against others, but standing up for myself FOR myself. Standing up for and respecting my inherent value as a person independent of anything or anyone. I think the truest respect comes only after that.",

When I got pregnant with my first I was terrified of having a girl. I sat in my car, had a panic attack and cried hysterically at just the thought of it. I wasn't ready to face all that childhood pain and the hang ups i had  that were reinforced by bad theology. The thought of my husband loving a girl less than a boy was honestly too much for me. I was afraid it would have broken me, even though that fear was completely irrational. I couldn't handle it. I remember the sheer relief and then guilt I felt at learning I was having a first born son. \n\nThis last pregnancy I felt more ready, I wanted a girl. I didn't care if I relived all the trauma, i thought it'd be worth it. I wanted a baby girl. \n\nNow that she's here and is just a couple weeks old we have these moments where she just quietly looks me in the eye. There's something deeply moving about it. She came into the world with nothing. No preconceived notion of gender, that's something everyone else puts on her. All at once I just kind of understood it's all bullshit. Having a girl is wonderful and beautiful, and equal to having a boy. Anything outside of that is personal preference, nothing more.\n\nI can't believe I was going to let what happened to me keep me from experiencing all this joy. I can't believe I was going to let my ndad take another thing away from me.. but I'm glad I didn't. ",

I have been nc with nmom for 13 almost 14 months. Right now I was reading another post how their only good memories are always tainted with something bad. That seems to be true for me too. \n\nGraduation should have been a very special day for anyone. I was proud of myself that I was graduating high school and that I did it with fairly no effort. My senior year I only needed about 20 credits to graduate because I had earned a bunch of elective credits from working. I didnt participate in any senior events such as prom and Grad night. Nmom offered to pay the $400+ for grad night but I declined. What for? So she can throw it in my face later on. No thanks. I paid for my own cap and gown and she took me to ross to buy a pair of shoes for graduation. I get my 10 tickets and I have no clue on who to invite to my graduation. I was nc with an older sister and my other sister and bro were nc with nmom. I invited my 2nd cousin that i barely talked to and my boyfriend. We had been dating for 2 years already and was 3 years older than me.\n\nIts graduation day, Im excited, nervous, happy. My boyfriend came and picked my mom and me up to take us to the arena. I head to the back with all the other students and she stays with my bf. He tells me later on how much of a hard time she gave him because he didnt want to sit where she wanted to 😒. Graduation is over and I head outside to look for my family. I find them. My boyfriend gives me a hug and went out to buy a balloon bouquet for me and a disposable camera for pictures. He gave me a big hug. My mom just stares. Not a hug, not a Im proud of you, not anything. It begins to sprinkle and she is rushing us to leave.\n\nI tell her wait for my cousin. I see my friends taking pictures but she is too worried about leaving and not being late for mass. I find my cousin and he gave me a big hug. I thank him for coming. She was already walking ahead of us. I had to rush and leave because she wanted to leave. I didnt get a picture with any of my friends or to even say hi to them because of her. That day was a real downer.\n\nIf it wasnt for my bf now husband that special day would have been ruined forever. I graduated May, I find out that Im pregnant in June, and in July I moved in with my bf and his family to another hell hole. It may seem like an insignificant memory to you guys but I dont know why I cant erase it. How can someone be so selfish? So cold? Funny how tables turn. She wanted my husband out of my life because she thought he was taking me from her. I was the only child at home. Her last shot to not be a lonely witch. Now my husband is the main person in my life and so is our son. She has no part in my life and we are very happy. We make sure to celebrate each other and make every single event special. \n\nI hope within time I can erase those memories. Cause God they are killing me and make me cry so much.\n",

It was really hard bc I am NC with everyone. I wasn't thinking at first (I wished I lied) and I told her that I have a brother, so she insisted on me creating sentences about him. I had to translate things like, \"I love my mother\" or \"I visited my brother\". It made my stomach turn.",

        "text": "Hi all.\nI have very recently detached myself completely from my, well, former best friend.\nIt took me years to admit to myself that he was a spectacular, overwhelming narcisist.\nI met him first day of high school, everything seemed to click. We shared interests, passions, you name it.\nA few years later he started to change drastically. A minor setback in school plunged him into a vortex of insanity from which I now believe he will NEVER get out of, mostly because, and this is what I was unwilling to acknowledge until very recently, he does not want to.\nOver the past 7 years I have been in the midst of an orchestra of misery. I justified him, made excuses for him, went to impossible lenghts to make him feel good about himself.\nAll for nothing, obviously.\nCommon friends and acquaintances warned me to steer well clear of him or at least not take him seriously, but I still wanted to believe that my friend was still there somewhere beneath the madness.\nDuring last year he lost what little grasp on reality he still had and went full supernova.\nHe has made use of hundreds, hundreds of people around him, shamelessly exploiting them for whatever flimsy instant need his tortured mind suggested. When I pointed out that this behaviour would only increase his misery in the long run, he scoffed at me and retorted that I was envious of his marvelous network of relationships. \nHe exploited me more than any other, of course. I started doing some maths on what his friendship cost me, financially speaking, and stopped after a few minutes because I felt like crying.\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was his response to me getting robbed while on vacation together with him and another guy, who had only seen his charming side up to that point. \nHe smirked and told me that if I had been with him (he was elsewhere during the robbery) I would not have been robbed and that the robbery was the rightful outcome of me, and I quote, not following his lead. \nI lost it and we almost came to blows. I wanted nothing more than to wipe that psychotic, inhuman grin from his face. \nAfter calming down a little I made sure that the other guy knew exactly who my friend was (although he pretty much had gotten the picture by then), called my friend's parents in front of him and outright stated that their son was far beyond my help (they had relied on me to help them out since he has driven them far beyond breaking point). \nI have blocked him from all social media and do not plan to interact with him again as long as I draw breath. \nI am left bitter, exhausted, demolished, anguished. \nI do not know if there is a hell after death, but I Do know that there is one on earth, hidden in a narcisist's satisfied grin. \nI now do not believe that a narcisist is entirely human. Not by a damn sight. \n",

        "text": "I have anxiety issues, and I always thought it was just social anxiety paralyzing me when it comes to really applying for good jobs, etc. I also thought it was just my low self esteem holding me back from pursuing the creative projects I want to do. But I think I've just realized that I actually avoid doing so many things that I want/need to do largely because I don't want people to question me about it. \n\nI'd moved away from my N-parents’ for a while, but live in the same town again and have contact at least weekly due to younger siblings still at home. I actually had to move back to care for/live with my N-grandparent (can definitely see where one of the N-parents got it). I live separate from the main house, but have to go there for kitchen/laundry facilities. Over the past few months I've noticed I just go without eating sometimes or procrastinate doing laundry as long as possible simply because even just the *thought* of encountering N-grandparent for an interrogation session and passive-aggressive suggestions drains the life out of me.\n\nMy N-mom is extremely nosy and judgemental and usually asks the same script of questions any time we talk, wanting more info about anything she knows or has heard is going on in my life at the time. This is exhausting too.\n\nI really just hate for my family to know anything at all about what's going on in my life. It even bothers me that they know I recently got a pet and comment on it frequently, because it feels like there's some angle to it (even just to gather info to retell the story to someone else later and thus get credit for having a conversation piece). It feels like they tarnish and ruin anything I try to enjoy, just because they know about it. It feels like it's way beyond just my dislike of small-talk because I'm introverted.\n\nSo… I've now noticed my tendency to have as little going on in my life as possible, just so I don't have to tell anyone about it. At least if they criticize me for not doing much, that feels like my choice. I've mostly learned to ignore them calling me lazy, but I'm still dealing with too much self doubt to run the risk of them crushing any momentum for a project I might start (which has happened so many times). Especially when it takes me a frustratingly long time for me to work up the nerve to even consider starting a project in the first place.\n\nSeems like the easy answer would just be to lie and hide things from them so they don't know, but I *hate* lying. It makes me feel awful. I've spent several long, hard years learning to be more open and feel genuine, and having to put up a wall again for them feels so wrong. It's almost like I don't have it in me anymore after I realized repression and walls are unhealthy and a waste of energy to maintain. Honestly after the relief of being away for a couple of years, I feel like I've forgotten how.\n\nIn retrospect I notice I didn't have quite as bad anxiety to seek/hold a job while I lived in another state away from my family, so I'm hoping to move away again. But does anyone else have similar experience feeling this way or have any tips for coping in the meantime?",

It took me about a year to stop saying, \"I'm sorry\" constantly. \n\nSince then I met Ms. Right, got married, and moved to another country. I'm very happy; my life is better than I ever imagined it could be. NEx still pokes at me from time to time, and I never answer her. She's tried offering to give me info on how the kids are doing, but only if I meet her for lunch; always the manipulator. Yesterday's message was all excited for me that I got married and moved to the EU. I can't believe that, after the shitty way that she discarded me, she thinks that I'll ever speak to her again.\n\nI still feel some pain and anxiety when I hear from her, but it's getting easier. I am so proud of myself for not falling for her attempts to draw me back in. I've avoided blocking her for all this time because of the kids, but I think it's time to let it go.

Perhaps he could have both disorders? Idk. He was diagnosed as ADHD as a child, but I'm thinking that could be a misdiagnosis, as I live in a small impoverished area and ADHD was the buzz word when he was younger. \n\nHe is my older brother, and my entire life he treated me poorly. He would do things and I would ask him to stop and he would agree, but then he'd do it again later. He's always treated me as though he's smarter and I don't know what I'm talking about. \n\nWhen I was really little and I wanted badly to be liked by him, I would even jump at his every command in hopes that I could get his attention for things that I enjoyed as well. I would fetch his soda for him, etc. \n\nWe've always been poor. So mom could only fix the food she could fix. If I didn't run to the kitchen and start eating right then, he would eat most everything. I have always been able to maintain a decent body weight but there were several times that I went to bed hungry because of him. \n\nIt's very obvious that he sees me through his lens. He thinks I like the same games as him, and that I give a shit about all the stuff that he gives a shit about. He jokingly says things like \"I don't know everything, just what's important.\" \n\nI'm so tired of his inability to *not* do the things I've tried to tell him not to do. He seems to know where the line is but he likes to tiptoe on it. He is mostly just annoying, all of the time. Makes inappropriate comments. \n\nI have issues with being touched. Sometimes I'm okay, I can take hugs other times I can't. He seems to feel entitled to pick at me, poke me in the shoulders and stupid shit and just hug me when ever he wants and he acts like I hurt him if I shrug him off and explain that I just don't want to be touched today. \n\nEvery time he doesn't get his way it's a rejection of him. I'm tired of it. I want my mental health. It has taken me the past two years to pull out of suicidal ideation. I had a horrible stint of suicide attempts as a teen. I know where my limit is for misery. I'm doing my best to take care of myself. \n\nWhen I start laying boundaries and trying to take care of myself, suddenly I'm a narcissist. \n\nWhat spurred me to make this post is today, I shared a funny political cartoon on Facebook that was NSFW. And he told me to never post anything like that again because he has to use Facebook while at work. He's a programmer. I told him to simply unfollow me and I wouldn't show up in his feed. No big deal, he could still check my shares when he's not at work. He then threatened to block me. I told him to go ahead and be a little bitch. It's sufficient to unfollow, that way I don't show up. I can understand not wanting NSFW stuff while you're at work. But his feed is his responsibility, not mine. I'm not going to edit myself for other people anymore. I'm compassionate and caring and I'm tired of that being taken advantage of. I'm beginning to give myself the same care that I've always given others and it feels right. He seems to be trying to stick me back in the box that had me willing to hang myself, and he seems oblivious to his actions. ",

They were shocked I used to listen to it regularly and wanted to know under what conditions I would have listened to it and eventually I confessed it was what my father (N) listened to and as a child that used to mean something to me. \nThis morning my husband asked me about it, starting with, \"so you used to idolize your dad?\" I shut him down and said I didn't want to talk about it. Why?  Because I didn't want to think about it. My husband studied psychology, and I caught on that he brought it up as a way to help me. He said I couldn't reach a state of catharsis if I wasn't willing to reevaluate my past, that it's a part of me, that I used to be a little girl, and that I have a little girl who loves her daddy, too. \nI bring this up because some of his words triggered emotions, and I had no control over the fat tear that fell, and I didn't know that I still carried this sensitivity. When will I know I'm ready to face it and how should I approach it? Because when I'm getting ready for a ten hour shift is not the time, but this shows me that it's still there and will continue to be there, despite having no contact for three years, reclaiming myself through support of my 'adopted' family, and knowing Ndad will be in jail maybe 2 or 3 more years.

        "text": "I hope you enjoy the bit of story, but I do have a question I hope you can relate to at the end. Thanks!\n\nIn a nutshell I am the last man standing in my family. Literally - I am the last. Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. All dead. Part of it was my parents being in their forties when I was born; part of it through bad luck. Regardless, I moved quite far from my native NY to live with some legal guardians. I lived with them for 2,918 days until I turned 18 (the summer after high school). They were, above all, failures. They had their own kids when they were each underage and were mostly able to get by thanks to the government's money for taking me in. It's just a guess of mine, but I imagine they were and are narcissists as a coping mechanism to cover for their lack of... everything else. In the ~8 years I knew them, I never observed either of them having any hobbies of any kind. They showed no interest in anything; on any level whatsoever. They were paradoxes: watched cooking shows without every picking up a spatula, watched home improvement shows without ever having enough ambition to improve their lot in life.\n\nOne of the two worked her meager customer service job while the other spent his life on the couch getting overly irritated at their toddler. But regardless of anyone's word, they were utterly confident they were respectable folk living worthwhile lives. But I never observed them to really get to know anyone. They had no real friends and were the kind of people to talk nice to the neighbors in person and complain about them 2 minutes later.\n\nBut I digress, this of all communities should already know the kind of thing I'm talking about. My part in this was that I, without having ever been able to pin it down until after the fact, knew there was more to life. And so I made it my mission; at a scant 10 years old, to escape those people and that kind of life. I understood, as well as a 10 year old kid understand anything, that kids pathologically likely to end up like their parents. It's just the fact that we're social creatures - we like being like our peers. So my challenge - my campaign - was to outlast these people and preserve my sanity whatever the cost. Why do I bring up sanity? Well because from the moment I set foot in that place it was made painfully clear my bootcamp session of family dying off was about to give way to the harsher reality of living by myself. I wasn't abused in the sense that I was never directly inflicted with any physical punishment. Instead, I was ignored. Or rather, perpetually made to feel as though my existence were an inconvenience, the response to which was of course to keep to myself. As a rule, the less contact with others in my own house, the better.\n\nSo what did I do? I read. A lot. Despite my situation I found I was easily in the top 5% of my class academically. So, as many of you in this community can empathize with, I poured myself into my academics. But there was a caveat, I never did it to gain renown. Never out of a sense of expectation; only because I was bored. I once calculated that, generously not counting time doing homework or sleeping, I spent no less than 18,000 hours alone in a half finished basement. Not locked of course, but certainly not welcome upstairs. And by not welcome I mean it was the unspoken rule that I would only be made to feel awkward and ashamed for showing my face. So yeah, the basement was preferable by far.\n\nAnyway, in high school I had two great teachers. They showed me how to attack academics with systematic ambition, as well as giving me a glimpse of the kind of people one can be when they don't think only of themselves. Otherwise, the school was poor - a 25% dropout rate and a faculty so asinine the students were hopelessly outclasses in any inter-school competition. Due to my general aptitude, I was occasionally asked to sit in on olympiads and the like when they were otherwise shorthanded. I remember how we as students came to, from a competitive standpoint, fear those from real academic academies. We were like children compared to these people.\n\nSo, put that all together, what does it make for? A reasonably capable young fellow, glaring lessons that the tools in front of me were trivial by normal standards, and a few good people pointing the way to a better life obtainable only through sheer ability. What it made was I learned to make the most of my academics. I knew I couldn't compete with people if I fought on their terms, so I did everything in new ways. I used no technology (didn't have any - not so much as a corded phone) and little access to textbooks. I thus actively practiced how to absorb knowledge, not just information but real knowledge, the first time. There are many niche techniques I invented for myself, an example which I never did like being the 'Mind Palace' (I never had a knack for it and obviously didn't invent it, but it gives some impression of the kind of 'techniques' I'm talking about - questions are welcome). In time I managed to get into a prestigious college, debt free I'll add. Though of course my guardians, taking a narcissistic offense to my success over that of them and their children, made every step of that process difficult. Every day was a new challenge, and as the years wore on so did my mental fortitude. I pushed myself just hard enough to go slightly mad by the end of it all.\n\nBut aside from that, it was fun! Of course day to day minutia were awful. But in the grander scheme it was an adventure, and I knew it. I knew that, unlike my peers, I had the chance to really invent myself. I didn't have parents, nor any real instructional support system of any kind, so I just paid attention. Whenever I saw people so slick or clever things, or present interesting moral philosophies, I took note and did what I could with it. That was the best part of everything - the quest! The opportunity to face down real foes - my gaurdians - and see what I was really made of. I remember (recall, I remember anything useful the first time) a line from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, \"Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.\". I loved seeing what I was really made of. I loved training myself in my basement fiercely enough to go toe to toe with the kind of folks to go to MIT and Harvard. It was brutal of course. At the time I likened myself to Rocky, wanting to prove \"I wasn't just another bum from the neighborhood\". And for my growth I paid an equally high price - I had to keep myself distant. I couldn't afford to get attached to people who would, whether as a significant other or just by setting bad examples, distract me from my goal.\n\nAnd that is where, after the fact, I felt I had gone too far. I won the shiny prize - a paid for tuition at the college in the caliber I was hunting for - but I wondered afterward if I had gone too far. I say that because, having known nothing but this ad-hoc work style which got me to college, I continued. It was a tremendous shock you see, surviving past 18. Say nothing of college itself. What you must appreciate to understand my later difficulty is this: I was in that basement for such an obnoxious amount of time I put off thinking about what I would do once I got out. Remember when you were a kid and it took the calendar an eternity to count down from Dec 1 to Dec 25th? Well imagine being a much more time perceptive kid and waiting almost 3,000 days instead. It was like counting to infinity. You know you'll never get to 'infinity', but sat you go on. You count and count until one day, you somehow do it. You finish; get through all the numbers. Of course that isn't actually possible, but that's the madness. I'm defining this thought experiment as one where you manage to count to infinity, and yet you want to retort 'but that's impossible!'. That was exactly my problem - I failed to appreciate what I had managed to do. Not in my own narcissistic way of course - I never would pat myself on the back - but in that I continued afterward to act as though I needed to be so desperate. \n\nFor a year afterward I didn't know how to describe my problem, until I heard something from the late physicist (I study physics) Richard Feynman, who was talking about how he felt after working and completing the Manhattan Project: \"With regard to moral questions, I do have something to say about it [helping to make the bomb]. The original reason to start the project which I had was that the Germans were a danger. And with any project like that, you continue to work trying to get success, having decided to do it. But what I did immorally, I would say, was not to remember the reason I said I was doing it. So that when the reason changed, which was that Germany was defeated, not the singlest thought came to my mind at all about that, that that meant I had to reconsider why I'm continuing to do this. I simply didn't think, okay?\"\n\nDo you perhaps see why this was helpful to me? The way in which I worked - as though my life depended on it - took quite a toll. To endure that kind of self imposed rigor you have to be willing to distance yourself from the mediocre, from the unambitious. I enjoyed what friend I had of course, but of the course of my 'campaign' I lost a good number of friends - some to having child of their own in HS, some to just mediocrity, one to heroin overdose - and I learned that it is indeed lonely being near the top. But I was willing - eager even - to forego that kind of sentimental thinking in order to achieve my goal. If I had stopped to get caught up in my feelings, or to get caught up in grief about being the last member of my family, I would have failed. So I neglected that part of myself for a very long time, all in order to 'defeat' my guardians. But of course I did end up succeeding, and I vastly opened my opportunities for life with my soon getting a degree (junior in undergrad now). Quick aside, I was touched by one of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, when Barbosa says, \"You know the problem with being the last of anything? It's that, by and by, there's not really any left at all\". There's a lot of truth to that.\n\n\nAnyway, I've gone on quite a lot, so here's the real trouble now: after getting into physics - getting a lab job, the upperclassman courses, meeting cool folks, etc. I've been feeling a bit 'civilized'. I borrow that description from Rocky III - after being a poor bum who got off the streets, he grows complacent and is accused of becoming 'civilized'. As his trainer, Micky, put it, 'Hell, you ain't been hungry since you won that belt'.\n\nI feel like that, in a way. I haven't been doing so well in classes recently, but it's not due to time or intelligence or anything. I haven't been able to attack my work the way I used to. But I also know that I can't just be as distant, or as desperate, as before. I'm not much of an anime person, but I remember seeing some Dragon Ball Z once; this really egotistical guy Vegeta gets upset and decalres his regret, \"I wanted him to return me to the way I was before! ... But slowly, over the years, I became one of you; my quest for greatness gradually giving way to this life of mediocrity.\" I didn't much care for Vegeta (too much ego, and as I said I didn't and don't care about renown, just seeing the best I can do). I bring up all these references - Frankenstein, Rocky, DBZ, PotC - not because they matter much, but because I hope some of you recognize these moments and it helps you relate.\n\nSo my question is this: for those of you who had great success after growing up with narcissists, was there ever anything about yourself that you miss from those days? I hope this is a new question for you. It's super common to see people ask about coping with narcissism, and I agree it's a terrible infliction to put up with, but as a scientist I naturally want to look at it the other way; was there every anything you felt you had when faced with such opposition that you could have used later? Or was it truly all terribly and do you simply wish it never happened? Thoughts, questions, and comments all welcome. Even if you just want to tell me I'm crazy for asking :)",

        "text": "We met in the summer of 2013. He was tall, had the most beautiful brown eyes, smile, was studying for a degree in engineering, and seemed like the perfect man to me. The beginning of the relationship was a dream come true. He showed me so much love and expressed to me how I was the only one for him. How he wanted to marry me because he was extremely religious and felt that the only way we could be truly happy is if we sealed the deal with a wedding. He was everything I could have hoped for in a guy. I was the perfect girlfriend. Big blue eyes, long black hair, graduated in the top of my class, prom queen. Everyone told me that they felt he was no good for me. But I didn't listen. \n\nSo I bought my wedding dress, started looking at venues, and began to plan my dream life with what I thought was my \"dream man.\" After about a year of us being together, I could sense that something was beginning to go downhill. He knew how much I loved him. I would've done anything for that man. Little did I know that he was just waiting for the perfect time, to see that I was so attached, that I wasn't going to leave his side no matter what the circumstances were. \n\nAfter the most perfect year of my life, he started to play games with me. He would start to break up with me over little things just so that I could call him, beg for him, and so that he could hear me cry. He felt reassured when he would hear me ball my eyes out over the phone in fear of me losing him. He loved how weak I was when it came to him. He loved the fact that I was willing to do anything just so that he could be in my life. When he saw that I was ready to do anything for him, he began to tell me that I couldn't wear makeup, couldn't let my hair down, that I couldn't go to the beach with my mom, or buy heels, or have social media, or talk to other guys, not even in class. I was so in love with him that I agreed to everything even though I would look into the mirror everyday and not even be able to recognize who I was. I would ask myself: \"Who cares if he is controlling you this much? You have a wedding to plan. Suck it up. You'll never find someone who loves you this much.\" \n\nA couple of days after our three year anniversary, I found a picture of him with his ex girlfriend at a bar. I was shocked. How could someone who had proposed to me, who had said he loved me, who I had given my all to, lie to me? Why was I not able to do anything, leave the house, put makeup on, get ready, but he was able to lie to me and sneak out to hang out with this girl whom he knew I didn't like? It was as if God/the Universe, whatever you want to believe in, was showing me concrete evidence of who this man was. With my own thoughts, I could somehow twist them around and reassure myself that he was a good man, a man of God, but with a tangible piece of evidence, a picture, there was no way that I could do that. This was the last straw. It was at that time that all of my doubts about this man came true. \n\nI know some of you are thinking: \"why would you ever stay in that relationship with him?\" But you never really understand why toxic relationships are so addictive until you actually go through them. These people are charming, attractive, they promise you the world and more through manipulative tactics. You create a trauma bond with them, to the point where your brain is so addicted to this person that the thought of you losing them makes you want to end your life. It's the same kind of situation as to being addicted to a very, very dangerous drug. You know it's no good for you, but you stay because of the high that it gives you.\n\nI showed him the picture the following day and told him that we were done. For him to never contact me again. He agreed and proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want anything to do with me either and blocked me on everything. He didn't apologize or call me or beg me for back. He didnt try to save OUR relationship. See, that's how narcissists are. They try to blame you for everything and make it seem like you're the bad guy. They only love you for what YOU do for them and they present themselves as charming, religious, and sweet talk you until you finally figure out who they are. Once they realize that you know that they are liars and manipulators, they discard you like nothing ever happened. They see you as an empathetic, genuine, sincere, kind person-basically a person who is easy to manipulate and everything they could never be. I guess what hurts the most is knowing that he could care less; all of those kisses, hugs, and presents meant nothing to him. Naming all of our kids and planning our dream home was just a lie. Three years and an engagement that he doesn't think twice about. I really hope he regrets what he did to me for the rest of his life, but people like him have no empathy or remorse for others. \n\n\nIt's been 14 days and I am no longer crying, shivering, not being able to sleep or eat. I'm getting so much better. I'm starting to realize that I was in love with a stranger. Someone who just manipulated me and used me. \n\nNarcissists don't feel remorse or regret. They don't truly love. They just use you and drain you until there is no longer a use for you. \n\nI turn 22 next week :) I am now letting my hair down, putting my makeup on, and I'm doing great in school. I'm so proud of myself for moving on. Im so proud of myself for finally realizing my worth and opening my eyes. For letting go of an emotional abusive person I swore I could never ever live without. For finally becoming the woman I've always wanted to be. \n\n\n",

        "text": "Short explanation about myself: I was an only child, my two cousins are 7 years older than me and we didn't meet very frequently when I was growing up. My only friends were kids of my parents' friends. I went to 2 different kindergardens and 5 different primary schools, in all of which I was either bullied, ostracized, made fun of or all of those together. I had very few friends growing up. My parents gave me two pieces of advice regarding social life at school:\n\n1. I have to find a social circle that I want to be part of at the start of the school year becase afterwards they close and they don't accept new friends.\n\n2. If someone bullies me or bothers me in any way, I have to ignore them and not react. When they realize that they can't get a reaction out of me, they'll grow tired and go bother someone else.\n\nThe first bit of advice always put a lot of pressure on me and only recently (I'm 36yo) I figured out that \"not reacting\" doesn't only mean not hitting back or not offending back, it means not crying, not going to the teacher, not getting upset.\n\nWhich makes me feel a looooooot better about myself and all my insecurities, that I could've prevented all the bullying and harrassing if I had only not cried. (/*eyeroll/*)\n\nAnyway, for me social interactions are usually incomprehensible. Luckily, I have one good friend who's been my best friend since 3rd grade, and I feel comfortable enough with her to ask her, \"this person said A, B and C, how should I react?\"\n\nAnyway, I have another friend - we became friends at work - the first job I ever had that I lasted in more than a couple of weeks. I'm still there after almost 3 years. We started working there together when the store opened and we became close friends.\n\nAbout 2 months ago she quit so she could focus on her finals and find a job in the field that she studied.\n\nShe came to my place a lot during the time until her exam (it was 2 weeks ago) to study because she couldn't focus at home. Feeling that she was like a sister to me, I even gave her my apt. keys and told her she could come at any time.\n\nTwo days before the exam she handed me the key back and said something like, \"thanks, I won't be needing this anymore.\"\n\nBefore she went in to her exam, I called her and wished her good luck and asked her to please let me know how it went afterwards.\n\nShe didn't call for 2-3 days.\n\nA few days later I was going through some difficulty and I was very stressed and upset and asked her if she could help me with some advice (she's very level-headed and reasonable). She said yes, I called her and in the middle of the conversation she asked me a quetion to which I gave an answer that was very racist to her and she was so offended that she told me she had to hang up to cool off because she was very upset.\n\nI only realized that she was upset and offended after she said that she was, and only then I realized that I said something racist, and I sent her a text message apologizing and explaining that I didn't know it was offensive and that I realize that only because an expression exists doesn't mean one should use it, I really felt bad and it's not an expression that I will ever use again. She texted me back saying that it was all cool and that she let it slide because it's me.\n\nWe talked maybe twice since then, both times I called or texted first but the conversation didn't continue beyond a very short reply from her.\n\nThe following Friday we were supposed to hang out and she cancelled at the last minute.\n\nWe haven't spoken at all since then.\n\nWe had plans to go out to this really good burger place where she lives either today or tomorrow with another friend of ours, and last night at almost 2am she sent me this text (translated word for word):\n\nHer: \"Hi, are you awake?\n\nListen, I'm flying on Tuesday and I have some things I have to do before, so on Monday I'm packing my bag, on Sunday I'm doing some shopping, on Friday (that you, me and 3rd friend wanted to go) - I won't be able to meet up because I'm babysitting - my sister works the evening shift.\n\nI'm free on Saturday, but I thought I'd spend the day with [fiancee] because I know it'll be rough on him...\" (she's going on vacation for a few days) \"...but you've been talking about going to [this restaurant] for some time now...\nSo I thought that on Saturday I'll do this: I'll get burgers for me, you and [fiancee], we'll sit at your place and only after the trip - me, you and [3rd friend] will go and eat there.\nThink about it and get back to me.\nThanks.\"\n\nThe single impression that I got from her text is that she thinks that she has a To-Do list where one of the items is \"Take Mimbsi to the restaurant\" and she wants to check that item off the list.\n\nSo I told her, \"Whatever you like, only I work this Saturday.\"\n\nThen she said, \"OK\"\n\nSo I noticed that she didn't say what she was doing today, so I asked, \"What are you doing today?\"\n\nShe answered \"Going out with a friend.\"\n\nI gave her a thumbs up.\n\nHer: \"But this is what you want... do you want to go or not?\nOr, you know, you could just go with [the 3rd friend] on Friday and after the trip we'll all go together.\"\n\nMe: \"So we'll go after the trip. I think that [3rd friend - who doesn't know about the fiancee yet] also wants to go. He also told me that he was bummed when we asked him if he wanted to join us that other day because we asked him so late at night and he worked the morning shift the next day. So I thought it would be a good idea to go today or tomorrow because it's a holiday and none of us work.\n\nOn the other hand, I really want for us to meet and chat, but I reeeeeaaally don't like the idea of us going out just so you can mark a \"V\" on the \"take Mimbsi out\" item in your to-do list, and even less when it's done in such a rush.\nYou want to meet, talk, eat something (I don't really care what, I liked that place because the food there is great and it looks very clean) - I'm all for it. Not as 'One more thing I have to do before my trip'\"\n\nHer: \"Mark a \"V\"? All I tried to do was to please you guys, not to mark a V. Whatever, think what you like.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but that's what it feels like to me. Maybe I misunderstood you. But when you talk about getting those burgers on Saturday even though you planned to spend it with your fiancee and that you can't do it at any other time because you're very busy feels very stressfull to me.\"\n\nHer: \"Whatever you say.\"\n\nMy last text to her in this whole stupid drama was: \"I think it will be best if we go out after you return. If we won't talk until then, have a pleasant flight and enjoy your trip, you earned it big time!\"\n\nAm I wrong? I probably am. Again, I'm (almost) completely clueless. But if she had just worded it differently, without adding all the stress she's in and all the stuff she has to do before her flight, then I might not have felt like she was just trying to get \"going out with Mimbsi\" over with.\n\nWhy is she allowed to get angry at me, offended (the comment I talked about wasn't the first instance of her getting really angry at me), I'm supposed to grovel and apologize, I'm supposed to be available for all the plans that she decides to include me in, but I'm /*never ever/* allowed to get angry and upset at her? I'm always made to feel guilty for even suggesting that I might be angry at her, for whatever reason.\n\nEvery time I ask her if she wants to do something, she says that she can't, or she's too tired, or busy or whatever, but I always have this feeling that if I refuse to go out with her when she asks me if I want to, then she'll never ask me again.\n\nThere were days at work that she was insufferable (either plain angry or just acting waaaaaaaay too silly or inappropriate like pinching me or harrassing me), but I was supposed to laugh and let it slide when all I wanted to do was to yell at her to stop it.\n\nI'm tired of being people's doormats, and this friendship with her is starting to feel a lot like the \"friendships\" I used to have at school, when the other kids were only nice to me when they needed to copy my homework in subjects I was really good at.\n\nIDK, people confuse me.",

MIL didn't say anything terrible really except for a few comments about how she knows exactly what i'm going through... umm no you don't. but mostly i've received radio silence from them. and they've asked my partner questions about whether i'm talking to Ndad but i nipped that in the butt. i had one more convo w MIL where i tried to explain how serious things are and how intensive the recovery is.\n\naround that same time - the in laws pulled some weird stuff trying to get my partner a job back closer to our hometown last year. and that pissed me right the eff off. i've been shut down w them ever since. (i tend to freeze in stressful situations.) i know that my silence isn't helping the situation but i don't feel safe opening up either. why would they want to uproot me when i'm going through such a hard time?\n\npartner and i are talking about all this. they know their parents have invalidated me and crossed boundaries w our marriage. partner also knows it's their job to set / monitor those boundaries and frankly - that they failed on that front last year. (without going into their whole background - initiating boundaries w them is new.) partner knows they need to protect me from their parents while we're there, that this trip is a huge deal for me trauma-wise. but i'm feeling a lot of anxiety. part of me doesn't see the point in confronting them bc they've done nothing to show they understand. why waste my energy? btu i also don't know how i can continue to be silent in the face of their invalidation.\n\nwhen i lay it all out - i really think they are Ns. which would make sense bc my partner and i got together when we were a couple of young sad kids. like we had some sort of depressed kid twinning happening. now tho - we live thousands of miles away from our families and are helping each other deal w our respective mental illnesses and process our emotions.\n\nok this is v long. thank you for reading if you got this far. has anyone gone through anything similar? any advice for how to handle the in laws, this trip, how to manage my anxiety, fresh takes on the situation are all welcome.

I am aware he has a new girlfriend, who he has been with for months now, they got together very soon after me. \n\nHe refuses to acknowledge anything he has done to me, or even talk to me. When I did contact him to tell him how sick he is, he said he wants to never have anything to do with each other for the rest of our lives, I thought how dare he after me dedicating 6 years to this psycho. He then told me to get a life, or go on tinder, I told him you can no longer control me or tell me what to do.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my life, that one of the biggest stressers of the past two years is finally gone. I hate how they pull you in, how fake they act first off. It has horribly tarnished my trust for other people, something that was already a challenge for me. I haven't been passionate about anything since the things we used to do together, but I have to keep reminding myself that none of it was real, and that there is absolutely nothing worth chasing after again. The pain and torture they gave me on the daily basis will never be worth the fake bond we had. All they'd do is attack me for things that had nothing to do with them, implied endlessly that I was the worst person they knew, they compared me to a supposed abusive brother of theirs that they claimed had beat them to the point of hospitalization. But now I'm sure even that never happened. All they wanted was to make me feel as shitty about myself as they could, so they could treat me however they wanted without me ever fighting back. They were allowed to endlessly belittle and accuse me of awful things yet I was never allowed to bring up when they did something that they did that hurt me, lest I be \"accusing them of being a bad person\"\n\nI was only able to break free recently when they screamed at me for supposedly \"forgetting\" their birthday when I had given them a gift early because I was moving back on campus at my college the day their birthday was. They felt this was good enough reason to give me the silent treatment for a week and I finally quit. I told them off as sarcastically as possible before blocking them on every social media platform I ever allowed them to add me on. \n\nThey were a friend I met online, tumblr to be exact. They are semi famous on the website and now I cannot interact with any fandom type stuff that would normally help me through this without seeing their art everywhere followed by endless flying monkeys who praise them for it day and night.\n\nI will soon be abandoning the website after well over 7 years avidly on it. Not much of a loss, but it disgusts me how much this sad little person was able to take away from me. But nothing will ever be worth going back to them. So I suppose I will have to do what I must. I hope to be relocating on Reddit, I'd much rather be in a less liberal environment anyways, I always detested the hostility that site has accumulated recently anyways.\n\nI just hope that I can find my passion for something else soon, something that doesn't have the goal to make me kill myself eventually.\nThank you for reading my rant if you have made it this far.\nThis is actually the second time I've escaped from a narcissistic relationship, though the first one was romantic, and significantly worse.

        "text": "Hey everyone. Child of Nparent. I just want to share a bit about my healing process over the last (almost) year. I feel liberated and you guys are the ones who understand. Talking to people who haven't experienced Ns is exhausting. \n\nAnyway, quick backstory: about 7 years ago my Ndad had some sort of mental breakdown which caused (still ongoing) alcoholism. He was an asshole before, now it's just exasperated. We've always had a rocky relationship. Over the last 14 years, I've gone on/off NC with him. The whole \"he's my dad\" pang always brought back my willingness to try again.\n\nSpring 2016 I began seeing a therapist, whom I love. She's been so incredibly helpful down this path of healing. Her, and my daughter. Baby is the reason I finally got into therapy. I knew I needed to work some shit out to be a good mom (was always afraid of having kids and fucking them up.) \n\nAfter I gave birth last October, I wrote my dad a letter (per therapy recommendation) as a last ditch \"pull yourself together or not only will I stay away, you'll never know your first grandchild.\" Long story short, I ended up going NC, and sticking to it. \n\nYOU GUYS, I'M FREE! \n\nI blocked him from being able to contact me. I'd get random texts telling me he missed me or some bullshit. It was like a violation. I didn't invite him into my world, and he'd suddenly pop up and I'd have all the emotions involved in that. My therapist actually suggested it because telling him \"I don't want to speak to you\" meant nothing to him. It's such a relief to know he can't surprise me. \n\nSo since I've had REAL distance from him, and I work daily on my mental and physical health (happy lady means happy wife/mother), I've come to a liberating conclusion: *I don't love my dad.*\n\nHoly shit does that feel good to admit. The little-girl-me no longer yearns for what a dad is supposed to be, or mourns my lack of one. I don't feel guilty for wishing he'd just die already and stop being a burden on my brother. I don't feel invested in his latest bullshit. I don't fucking care because I don't love him. And why should I? He's incapable of love, and definitely doesn't deserve any from me. \n\nI'll still continue therapy because the damage caused being raised by him is not so easily fixed. Not that getting here was easy. It was tough, and heartbreaking. But my heart can really start to heal. \n\nI no longer have to be defined by his narcissism. Life after is goddamn sparkly. I'ma shine bright like a diamond. \n\n",

A week ago this time, she knocked on my door and told me about how much work she had done for the bathroom, including everything, picking up the hair on the floor, wipe the mirror, and say \"I was the one who did all the work\" etc. I can tell by her facial expression that she thinks it is my job to also clean the bathroom just like she do, in every detail including picking up the hair and cleaning the mirror and stuff.\n\nShe asked me, \"can you clean the bathroom?\" I replied, \"yes okay, I can clean it once a week.\"   She said, \"yea, okay, you can clean it once a week, or maybe twice a week.\" (Notice how she insert her extra demand)\n\nI didn't respond to that but direct the attention to talk about the kitchen. \n\nThen, today, I woke up and used the toilet and saw a sticky note posting on the mirror, which writes, \n\"on sept 16th, roommate name, cleaned *everything* in the bathroom. Mirror, shelf, toilet, scrub the bathtub, and pick up the hair on the floor. Please remember to remove the hair in the filter! :)\"\n\nAt least, in my opinion, she is telling me how much she had done in the bathroom, and how less I have done. But then, I bought some wiping cloth this week, and cleaning vim(or whatever it's called), I vacuum the floor and wiped the counter. But now I really think that she didn't really notice what I did. \n\nYea, and right now she is singing in her room like really loudly, I can hear it. It's so goddamn annoying TBH. Also, I wanna say that it's not until I play my guitar did I hear she singing. She sings WHEN I start playing the guitar, same timing.  I deliberately stop to see what happen, guess what she stops. ???? \n\nI really could go up to her room and smash her face. She is just so goddamn annoying please help me. \n\n?????\n\nEdit - Also, I don't have utensils to clean the bathroom like the toilet, so I think she is making this much harder for me.",

I've had extensive therapy in the past to treat my anxiety, but the nightmares are starting again and I am really struggling to readjust. I was wondering if anyone has had a diagnosis of complex PTSD and some of the coping strategies that work for them? I'm hesitant to pathologise a normal reaction to coming out of an abusive situation, but I'm just not doing so great either. Thanks!!",

As of now I consider the problem to be trying to live a life knowing you don't have parents. Because why would anyone consider their Nparents actual PARENTS after a lifetime of abuse. How have you all dealt with this? The emptiness, the anxiety and living in real time and not in a world you had to create for yourself when you were living with them.\n\nEdit: I meant days not says sorry",

Shes only crazy to him because of what I've told him. Not because of his own experiences. He has no idea what I went through and I can say with confidence that I am nothing like my mom. I've asked him to stop bringing up my rape, my mother, the fact that my family is broken, and now here in the last several months, to stop including everyone in our affairs. It's like if I ask him ( nicely and give him good reasons, like hey, this hurts!) he does just that. I told him that it would be so much easier if he just told me he hates and despises me and looks to make me as unhappy as humanly possible. That at least I could believe and accept. This is ridiculous. Where the hell was his family LAST night? They want to believe his lies and stories about his crazy wife, I seriously wish they could see him in action. If I'm portrayed as crazy there is a good reason for it. No one would put up with stuff that I have and here I am shoving everything into the back of my mind and pretending he didn't say it. I replace it with reminding myself that I love this man, and there HAS to be some way I can make him love me as much. Haha. As I write this I'm laughing. Sounds so stupid!!!!! I can't make him love me!!! Why did I marry someone that could never love me??? Wish I knew. I just see his relationships getting better and better with others at the expense of my misery. Hating me brings them closer. It's funny how family works like that. That is why I've never wanted to be around my family. I want MY own family!",

        "text": "I am currently on the end of abuse from a narcissist and the situation continues to worsen. It was a professional situation (she was a fitness trainer of mine). This woman apparently lives a double life - married to a wealthy influential man but runs around during the day while he thinks she is at work with training clients. She is know in the community as a sexual predatory (she apparently has a thing for 20 yr old girls) but through intimidation etc. keeps people who know quiet.  She and I had what I thought was an attraction but I ended up keeping my distance since something didn't seem quite right about it all. After she made a second overture in my direction (to hook up), which I turned down, she end up hooking up with a 20 yr old girl in our group exercise class. I ignored and kept training with her (she was a good trainer) but things got worse (she was late for sessions etc) and I shut down the relationship. That was two years ago. Since then my phone and computer have been hacked, by car involved in a hit/run, I have been run out of 3 gyms (via her \"flying monkeys\") and she has hooked up with 3 20-yr old girls and flaunted it front of everyone to say that I didn't add up and she turned me down (I am older). I moved last Oct to my small hometown (5 hrs from the city we were in together) and she was able to make contacts here in addition to maligning my reputation (Inc my family) as she has had access to personal info via my phone/computer. I now just found out the my house and my car is bugged. Last weekend I had a tearful moment in my car due to a family situation (I was driving alone) and she post messages of it on Facebook (that is how I was tipped off about my car being bugged). Since you are all well aware of how narcissists work you know that when you talk about this to authorities that have not experienced one, they look at your like you are the one who is crazy.  The local police have helped with the situation (it is not as crazy as it was when I was being followed by car and my car was hit) but they refuse to file a report since they think it is a \"relationship issue\". The shut off the communication with this woman 2-3 yrs ago. She is in my life only due to force (hacking and bugging). I am stuck - any next step would involve lots of money to address which I don't have (bug sweep, lawyer, etc). \n\nAny thoughts/advice?",

I'm not sure, I just need a few words from people who get it a bit.\nEither way the Reddit community (and some therapy) has been helpful to me these past few months as I struggled working through a brief but awful relationship with a Narc, and it brought up a lot of my past with my abusive father...\n\nSo here I am, just finished my studies literally a few weeks ago with nothing coming up for the first time in my life. And I meet a guy, someone who is young(er)but seems really good and fun (this time I asked other people for their opinions, because I didn't last time and now I don't trust myself anymore with these things...). We worked and lived in the same place these last few weeks which meant we were together almost 24/7. It got loving quickly and we just said our goodbyes and that we want to see each other again.\n\nThe weird part is that he is really sweet in a sunny way...but a part of me blocks him out. Even when he says sweet things I start doubting his motivations (that's just me being paranoid though I think, there are no red flags and no weird gut feeling, he hasn't said anything that could possibly hurt me once). When he doesn't do what my Nex did, which is to get too deep too quickly, talk about super intense things, bringing up everything shit from both our pasts and dwell on it for hours - then I also feel like something is missing. Like, why aren't we spending long nights bonding about traumatic things that happened to us and our childhood abuse and whatnot? \n\nOn one hand I might have just gotten used to a really toxic relationship pattern, on the other hand, he might really be too young and sweet and innocent for someone as 'dark' and hurt as me? He seems so content, I don't see myself talking about my emotions for hours or talking about how to make the world a better place for hours with him. If anything I'd probably negatively affect him if this continues and I don't want to do that. On the other hand, i don't want to only be with 'dark' people for the rest of my life. \nWhere am I going wrong? Am I overthinking this? Am I just not ready to date again? I don't want to mess this up and I'm worried that no matter what I do I will. ",

        "text": "So, I've been avoiding therapy for years now due to health insurance, money, time, etc.. I used every excuse in the book. I think that the real reason is that I have a hard time understanding- let alone explaining my feelings. I (like most of us) was always taught to push everything down and put on a brave face no matter how upset I may be. After years of this, I no longer have the ability to express feeling/ emotion. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on how to express this to my therapist without word vomiting? I mean, I just can't wrap my head around how I'm supposed to tell a professional my thoughts when I have a hard time thinking about them. On top of all of this, I have involuntarily memory loss, probably repressed memories , but I feel like it'll be hard to explain my entire situation without details. \n\nI want to get the most out of therapy, but I'm feeling concerned about how to communicate. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you. \n\n\n\n\nEdit: Werdz ",

        "text": "As I slowly heal from the abuse, I started randomly remembering things my NMom did (and EDad let her do). I've seen other redditors have this happen, so I know I'm not alone. It's been a weird thing. It's nice to not have all the repressed memories hit me at once, but also they just randomly come to me...and sometimes they seem to criple me. \"Oh you're at work trying to focus on your dying patient? Here's a traumatic memory! Good luck not breaking down now!\"\n\n\nThis memory is a seemingly minor one, but I need to just get this off my chest. I'll give a little background first. I wanted to be a nurse from my junior year of high school. I had to do a research project on a career and after that I just knew. I know I'm lucky to have known that so early. (I used to beat myself up over being one of the few people who knew exactly what I wanted and had a clear path of how to do it. So many of my friends didn't know.)\n\n\nThe seemingly best option for me was a 4 year college. I could get away from my parents with relative ease and everyone said I *had* to have a 4 year degree. There are so many nursing schools to choose from in my state and I had no sort of attachment to any college. NMom told me I had to apply to the singular college I wanted to go to. She was absolutely useless in helping me choose one. Neither of my parents were paying for my college. NMom said she would tour wherever I wanted, but quickly became angry when I couldn't choose one immediately. She just didn't want to pay for application fees. So I had to scrounge the money up to do so or find ones I could apply to for free. \n\n\nI just remember how adamant she was that I apply to one college. How angry she became when I couldn't make a decision on her time frame. And how ridiculous it was that she was like this considering she was only paying for the application fees. We weren't poor. My parents didn't manage money well until after my sister and I moved out. They also put my sister through private school K-8. They put me through it K-12. So that was ridiculously expensive for no good reason. \n\n\nI thought typing this might help me. Now I feel more angry and sad than I did before. Why am I so upset over something that is so minor?\n\n\n\nThank you for reading ❤",

        "text": "Thought I would post this here, original posted on r/raisedbynarcissists\n\nThis is along post and apologies for any spelling mistakes &amp; bad grammar - This Story does not even touch the surface but you'll get the idea.\nGrowing up all I seem to remember is constantly being shouted at, made to feel worthless, belittled, and beaten. I suppose I deserved some of them...or did I? I could tell my parents were stressed, must have been financial stress, though that is no excuse to take it out on the scapegoat. I remember the verbal, emotional, &amp; physical abuse when I did wrong, but equally I remember the abuse and still not knowing what it was I did wrong, I learnt not to ask or argue back …. the hard way.\nI recall once in the kitchen, accidentally dropping a tray or letting go of a closing cupboard door too early, looked up at my mother, smiled and apologised ‘Sorry, it slipped’, I had these red angry eyes looking at me, and without a second of hesitation she lashed out at me, calling me all sorts, shouting verbal &amp; emotional abuse at me whilst slapping me continuously. It was an accident, a genuine accident, but as a child, probably 8 or 9 years old, I had no idea what I did part from letting go of the cupboard too soon. Lesson here: close the cupboard doors slowly if you want to save your ass from a beating. 1 time I remember being beaten so bad I had a nose bleed, must have been about 8-9 as well. I got beats with an Indian rolling pin. I recall receiving a beating 2-3 times a week growing up. Once got beats with my school shoes because I kept them under my bed and not in the hallway, must have been about 11 here, went to school with a bump on head for a week.\nAll these beatings I thought was normal, and that all kids got them. It was only when I was much older I realised the most beatings my mates got was the odd slap here &amp; there, and that's when they did something real bad.\nI recall a time when my dad was telling my sister off, she must have been 5, and I was 11, and it was because she said or did something wrong. All of a sudden, my mum came out of nowhere and had a go at my dad for telling my sister off, saying “It’s him who we are meant to be telling of” I remember this clearly, and not know whether I should ignore this or to be upset, must have actually been my fault.\nI remember my dad advising me to tread carefully because ‘she; doesn’t like you. Why? I don’t know, she just doesn’t.\nMy parents were close to going through a divorce, I must have been 12-13 years old. My dad asked me &amp; my sister woi we would want to live with, not wanting to split up we both replied Mum. And when my mum asked us another day we replied ‘Dad’. This way they had to stay together…...well felt like they had to for our sakes. To be truthful, if it came down to it, I would have chosen my Dad.\nIt was like walking on eggshells when my mum was home, we looked forward to the weekend hoping she was at work doing overtime, this gave us a day to just chill. If not, my mum would wake us up early, get ready, and start doing house work. My mum has OCD, but bullies us into cleaning &amp; polishing the house…….where my other friends would be watching Saturday morning TV, or, just enjoying themselves playing in the garden etc.\nI was constantly paranoid, I didn’t know what mood sh would be in, we had to judge before opening our mouths or joking around, she could just switch at any time.\nEven today, if I hear the sounds of banging kitchen utensils I get anxiety, thinking someone is angry, and it was because this is what my mum use to do.\nAt School I was quite, unable to connect with a lot of people, but at the same time I tried to hang out and make friends as I felt the need to be part of something, at least know the cool people, but was easily bullied at School. Didn’t matter where I was at Home or at School I was bound to be bullied. Didn’t feel safe anywhere apart from my room….and even then I wasn’t allowed to spend too much time locked up in my room. On the weekends I had homework from School, but before I could do this, i was made to do all the chores in the house, and then sent to my room to do homework, but by this time I couldn’t be bothered to do it, and so did not concentrate or finish it to the best of my ability.\nI never really understood why I was weird when I started college and after, I kind of knew at the back of my mind it’s because of how my mum treated me, but I was in denial, as all my other friends seem to have had loving parents, and were pretty normal guys. I tried to be normal as well. I would not open up to them about my issues as I didn’t want them to be true. I made out that everything is fine at home with the family, we are a normal bunch of people.\nWhen i was 8/9 my mum asked me if I had any money she could borrow, and coincidently I had a fiver (£5) which was gifted to me by another family member. She said she will pay me back next day (I didn’t ask when I’d get it back, I didn’t expect it back), but my mum kept going on about how she will pay me back, to remind her tomorrow, she has money coming in etc….so, a few days later, I asked my mum for the fiver, guess what? All hell broke lose, I got so much verbal abuse from my mum telling me how dare I ask her for money especially after feeding me and putting clothes on my back. This was the reason why I wasn’t expecting it back, but as my mum kept insisting she will sort me out and to remind her, so I did. I knew never again.\nOnly when we had a lot of people round our house, a lot of family members, would she put her arms out for a hug, which felt very weird as this had never happened before, it was to show people everything is fine and I’m loved so much, this carried on like this whenever people where around. But never on a daily basis. It was like I wasn’t loved, and I felt unloved growing up.\nI contemplated running away a few times, but just didn’t know what to do, and just didn't go through with it.\nAt age 9, the final 2 years of primary school, my parents sent me to a private school, it was a boys school, it was not a proper school as all the teachers were interested in was hitting the students when they did the slightest thing wrong. I did this for 2 years and then looked forward to attending a new school, a secondary school, I knew I wanted to go to a mix school, but my mum made me go to a boys school, because 1 of my cousins attended that school, I knew I had it, 5 years in a mix school with no girls, I didn't know how it would end up.\nAfter GCSEs, which I got mainly Cs &amp; Ds, and 1 E, I was abused at home for achieving nothing, why didn’t I study. My mum on the other hand was shocked I didn’t receive any A’s! My dad had to explain the papers I took were Intermediate &amp; Lower papers, there is no option for A, my mum never paid any attention to my studies, how well i was doing, and what I was capable of.\nI use to throw the hammer from the ages 14-17. In the early years from watching 1 of the athletics meetings on TV I learnt anyone breaking a record were awarded a brand new Mercedes - I remember going to my mum and saying ‘When I win, I will sort you out with a brand new Mercedes’, I was ridiculed and made to feel little “You can’t win that, you know how hard it is? Don’t make promises you can't keep” and this was shouted at me with mad rage, rather than a little encouragement &amp; motivation - What the hell?\nAt 16 I went to College. Yes, finally made it through school, now I can start fresh, and have some new friends and meet new people. I learnt I couldn’t talk to girls, and that I was not worthy of their friendship, as all the pretty girls couldn’t be seen dead speaking to an average or weird guy, and no i found it difficult to communicate with them. Now this was a real bitch. My class for 2 years didn’t have any girls in it either. Other boys who went to school with girls found it easy to speak to them, to joke around and have a laugh. I’ve worked hard to be able to speak to them now, but still unable to just approach and speak to them.\nI moved out at age 31, i bought a 2 bedroom maisonette, my dad helped me with the deposit, thinking I’ll use it as an investment rather than moving out. I did the place up and moved out. YES Finally! I’m free….but I wasn’t, I hadn’t fund the root cause. I use to smoke weed, 1 joint a night, but when I moved out, I was smoking every night until I passed out. I was masking my feelings, this was my escapism. I am so glad I didn’t use alcohol, I may have died from a liver failure. I event ually moved back into my aprents a year later as my mum kept insisting this is my house and it’s all yours, come back. My grnadma who I loved so dearly use to uask me to move home, she knew so mething was up, but it’s Indian tradition for families to stay together, and I was psychologically trapped in this mental prison. So I moved back home and a day later my Grandma passed away.\nI kept going in &amp; out of depression, only going to the gym helped, but this was temporary only.\nSo I lack a lot of life skills, and after finding the term narcissism/narcissist, and Son of a Narcissistic Mother, I realised why I was the way I was, why I was weird, why I lacked complete desire to do well in life, being heartless, negative, and criticizing everything. Now, the 1st time ever, i feel I can move on as I have found the root cause. Trying to change when not understanding the root cause does not helps, I found it virtually impossible.\nI lacked confidence Self esteem Expected rejection Unable to talk to the opposite sex properly.\nNow I am making changes, changes in my mind set. Understanding It was never my fault, and understanding I can be fixed. I can fix myself. I am Fixing myself!\nIt will take me a while, but I’ve started the journey, and will complete it. I am Worthy!\nMy maisonette is on rent, have the tenants moving out end of the month, and I’ll be moving back in, and I cannot wait.\nI feel I have found the root cause, and this will allow me to really understand what i went through and be able to better deal with stuff. I have stopped smoking, with no intentions of starting again.\nThank you for reading if you have reached this far - There is Hope!",

        "text": "Hey all! Lurker here who's been too busy lately to do much thinking about the toxic past (all in a good way).\n\nBut great news today that I wanted to share with people who get it.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I never liked my legal name. First, middle, or surname. Always felt an extreme disconnect with my immediate and extended FOO, though much of the reasons why didn't click until college, which is where I chose my own full name to go by.\n\nOver the years I slowly switched over to using my preferred name everywhere allowed. But it never occurred to me to legally change it until a few years ago. Depression/anxiety bouts kept me from going through with it--unknown steps to do so (I like knowing exactly what needs to be done and how, which was hard to figure out) and continuous debates on whether I truly wanted to stick with my chosen name.\n\nI work in an industry where I'm essentially a freelancer jumping from gig to gig, which makes paperwork and legal ID problematic often. I also get sick of strangers asking why I go by a name so vastly different from my birth name (plus the occasional \"oh but that's so pretty you should just use that name\" comments). Explaining my backstory is awkward even with my SO, and my anxiety spikes when others ask, especially since most people don't understand why I don't talk to the FOO.\n\nSo I finally overcame my anxiety and filed a name change petition. Today it was granted by the court! A lot of messy steps to switch over everything, but I cried in my SO's arms this morning explaining how I never felt attached t my given name and how excited I am to fully embrace the identity I've created for myself.\n\nI hope this can be a huge step toward the continued recovery from my toxic upbringing.\n\nThanks for listening, guys!",

I'd like to maayybbeee start making kind gestures that do not in any way threaten my own mental or emotional well being, but that can maybe shine some light in her life.    I know that she misses and loves me terribly and is excrutiatingly depressed, but that she's too sick to change her life or herself, so I can't be around her.  Or talk to her or be in the same zip code as her or head other people talking about her.  gah.\n\nSo yeah, ideas?  I was thinking one of those websites that send cards for you.  Her birthday is next month, maybe I'll send something?  \n\nThis seems crazy to even be talking like this; I've been HARD NC for four years.  I think it's that I've been in recovery enough years now that I've heard shares in groups by parents whose children won't talk to them, and just all the shares in general describing heartbreak and loneliness, and all the books about PTSD and trauma and how these things are inherited through generations.  And I think about what my mom and my aunt have told me about my grandfather, and how my mom always said she has forgiven him, because of what he'd had to live through before he was married.  My mom might be destructive toward me, but if I look at it from the outside, she's also someone who has had a tremendously painful life, starting when she was 3.  I know I can't be the one to fix anything, but I want to at least let her know that I still care about her, even if I have to do it at a very safe distance.  Does that make sense to anyone????",

To be, or not to be.\n\nI have set so many firewalls and fortresses so that she can't get to me, even through the mail, but lawyers have their ways I guess.  I got this big envelope a couple weeks ago saying she had named me Medical POA.  I flipped, called the law office, said 'thanks but no thanks' and then put it to rest in my head.  \n\nYou WOULD THINK you'd have to get a signature in order to agree to such a responsibility - but no.  You can just say 'Hey you know Bill down at the Arco station seems like a nice guy - I name him!' and then Bill's living his life and one day he finds out it's up to him to pull a plug or not.  SERIOUSLY!  Apparently Bill CAN say he is unwilling or unable to act as MPOA, and then it goes to the secondary person who has been named.\n\nThey told me the secondary person my mom had named was Pat.  Oh boy do I hate Pat!  Was my loving 'aunt' for my whole life and then became the queen of flying monkeys.  \n\nSo this was almost a month ago.  And now I've had time to process.  And you know, my mom is THE WORST, the wooorrrsssstttt.  She is 70, and has chosen a path of addiction and loneliness.  Her whole life has been terrible and now there is no one left.\n\nSo I called the lawyers back just now and said \"never mind, i'll do it.\"\n\nI hate the idea of Pat being in charge a tiny bit more than the idea of being called in during my mom's potential final days.  Does that make sense?  \n\nI'm still gonna keep up with the NC, but I am starting to feel like as I myself get older, and my friends have become parents too, and I'm around more elderly people, and I've heard more and more stories of heartbreak ruining the relationships between every generation of so many families... I don't know.  I'm not waffling on the NC, she really will only bring disaster to my life.  But I'm thinking about starting to send her the occasional card or something.  Like with one of those apps that just sends it for you.  And she won't be able to respond etc.\n\nMeehhhhhh.  Thoughts are welcome.",

        "text": "xpost to r/RBN\n\nHi everyone, \n\nI apologize this is so long. I have been trapped in and out of a fog regarding my family. We are NC for a few years, and I still find myself thinking about this over and over again like groundhog day. My Nmom died in Feb  this year, so maybe this is grief and I am giving myself a hard time for not being 'normal' - I don't know. I was really thrown for a loop though with everything that happened since my Ndad died unexpectedly.  \n\nhere are the last emails I exchanged with my Nmom right after Ndad died, I hired an attorney after going into a screaming fit after my Ndad's funeral - trying to get my younger sister to stop following me and harassing me about my dad's college ring I was keeping. We fought, I ended up getting left in a mall parking lot and told to get a cab to my Nbro's new 'fiance's' house (she was still legally married) so we could all eat after Ndad's funeral. I did not take proper care of myself and instead chose to 'be with my family'. I should have left and taken my own car, and I didn't.   After the blowout I hired an attorney since my siblings who were in control of my father's estate started telling me I could not enter my father's house \"because you don't have a key.\" I just never picked one up from my dad. That's all. After I hired the attorney, all siblings went immediately NC with me. I have not spoken to them since, even since my mom died. I have seen younger sister around town and she has said \"get away from me.\" \n\nI am really struggling and would love to get some feedback from you all - you guys rule. I think you can decode these narc-emails into english that I can't see because of the fog that I get trapped in around thinking about my family. \n\n\nA year or so after these emails, turns out Nmom had cancer. Never told me. (the \"why you are doing this\" in the email is referring to me hiring an attorney re: dad's will).  She had no relationship with my Ndad after he kidnapped us kids, and she did not come and get us, stating that her therapist told her \"your kids will be fine.\" And constantly referred to my kidnapping as \"when you kids left.\" She continued to sue my father for child support, however. \n\nThanks in advance for decoding these emails. I feel extremely vulnerable posting them - but I don't know how else to break it down and keep it short. \n\nI appreciate you all.\n\n\nhi mom,\n\nI know things are not good between us right now and i am trying to work on acceptance with our relationship. i just wanted to tell you happy birthday and that i love you, regardless of how bad things are. i still love you.\n\ni hope you have a really great day.\n\nlove haps.\n\n\n2/27/14\n\nto me \nHaps - \nOur relationship has always had ups and downs. But that was always just between us.I was so hopeful we were past that.I was so proud of you\n.everyone was so proud of you and how you had pulled your life together\nI don't understand why you are doing this. Nbro. has always been the go between when it came to you and your father. The time many years ago when he stood up for you to the point he and your dad had such a fight about you they stopped talking for awhile .\n2 years ago when you didn't have rent money he told your dad who didnt want to that your dad had to pay your rent. Your dad paid it because of Nbro. Remember I was afraid it might cause a problem for Nbro because he and your dad were at that time in a very close relationship which lasted . NBro took that chance to get you your rent.\nOlder sis  has always been your big sister.the times you two weren't talking were because you got mad at her and didn't like something she said or her tone. Every single time you started treating her nicely she was right back \nYounger sis  has always been your biggest booster. She is always compassionate about you always ready with reasons why you do or feel things.\nI'm in shock how this is happening.\nYou know Nbro (older) and Older sister had a relationship with with your father and you really didn't until the very end. You know I was always telling you to call him and in the last year and a half when you weren't talking to me I kept telling Older sister to tell you to call him and she said she was already doing that. Everyone looking out for you.\nI just don't get it. How you could think the way you are thinking now. It doesn't make sense. The people who looked out for you have now suddenly become in your mind the enemy.. this is so unbelievably sad. You got angry with them and twisted it around. Nobody is doing anything to you or taking something from you or hiding anything and if you hadn't gotten mad at them and told all of them to f off you would know this because all four of you would have gone thru the same thing ( the house car etc) at the same time all helping each other and grieving together. It is so sad. I am so sad.\n\n\nMy response in 2014 -\nMom, \n\nWe will have to agree to disagree. \n\nFor the future, I respectfully ask that you keep your comments and opinions about my relationship with my father to yourself, as they don't reflect what is true for me. \n\nI love you,\n\nHaps.\n\n***After this - I gaslit myself and thought I had gone NC with Nmom. I hadn't. I only figured this out a few months ago when I intentionally went into my email box to read these emails, and I was so shocked I hadn't seen that she is the one (as a mother) that was supposed to keep up contact with me, and she did not. I was so used to being blamed in my family that I actually thought my emails had made her stop talking to me. \n\nAfter I sent this last email, she only contacted me on my birthday each year to say \"I hope this is a good year for you I have unconditional love for you. Happy birthday. Love Mom.\" Or emails of that sort. Very short, same sentiment. ",

He's actually quite a lovely person, it was my mom who was, and I've had a few other rough issues from childhood, too, (trigger: [Spoiler](/s \"Child on Child SA\" ) that I never had therapy for.  Putting that out there.\n\nSo my SO has taken to being genuinely nice and caring the past couple of months.  Not saying he wasn't before, but he's an Aspie, and sometimes does Aspie things (like I do on my own), like get burnt out because someone doesn't want to do something, emote a little too loudly or be too dramatic (means well, but very vocal, whenever I screw up a video game), and try to get me to agree to his points on personal taste (nothing big, and he never forced me, but the disappointment was almost visible.)\n\nJust a genuinely nice guy with a few quirks with a very supportive family who love each other very much.\n\nBut now he's accepted I will never share the same viewpoints as him, and it's fine.  He now says I can sleep in the middle of our king sized bed (when we first moved out, he grumped about how I took up most of the bed, now he's encouraging it), and whenever I ask if we can do something, he says sure and we just do it.  \n\nI don't have to fight, there's no conflict, and I know a lot of people would be happy, but it's so alien to me.  I had a meltdown on the first night he let me sleep in the middle again, and I even admitted I tried starting some squabbles during the day because I just don't register that I ask and it's done.  It's just swimming in my head.  He's never been abusive, but he'd always get grumpy if we wanted to do something he didn't want to do, or, again, be a little too emotive during video games.  He just hugged me and let me fall asleep on him.\n\nWill I ever get used to this, because it sure feels alien...",

I told her that i need a few dollars to really get me going, no big deal and that ill pay her back as soon as i get my second job. She doesnt answer for a day, and only answered when i asked if i needed to ask someone else. Granted, i said that cause she usually goes completely ghost when i ask of anything from her. She proceded to say that my text was nasty, that she was sleep when i had texted her, (at 534 in the evening) and that i should move closer to her. Last time that happened i ended up by myself with no help. The upseting part is that, i feel like im in the wrong in all of this. That i shouldnt be asking for help, or im being an extra burden on her. Its very hard going through my healing journey when stuff like this keeps popping up, and i really dont have a clue of what to do. She's my last resort, but everytime i needed her for all of my life, shes always gone or dont have time and it really upsets me.",

I told her that I found a paralegal and will be initiating all the paperwork.   \n\nShe told me to let her know if I need anything else from her. I still have $2600 in wedding debt and the legal/court fees are ~$700. I told her \"Well, can you help me pay off the remainder of the wedding debt?\"  \n\nHer response was \"I can absolutely do my best to help you. Can we maybe set aside time for a phone call soon to talk about everything? There are going to be a few things I'm sure that are going to need some discussing as opposed to texting.. a phone call would be easier\"  \n\nI agreed and we were supposed to talk yesterday and she never called me. She texted me just now apologizing and wanting to set up a new time.   \n\nI haven't responded, but at this point I don't know if chasing her down to pay for this is even worth my time. In fact, I think it's holding me back from healing. I make a decent salary and am temporarily back with my parents so I could probably pay for all that with not too much issue.   \n\nMy question for all of you: Is it worth trying to get her help to pay for this? If she genuinely wanted to help, she would've already and I wouldn't even have to be asking.   \n\nIs she using this debt situation to try to hold power over me? So i'm running to her for financial help?  \n\nI don't know if this is something I should pursue. Part of me just wants to say \"I will have the summary dissolution forms. All I need is your signature. I will give this to your brother for you to sign\"  \n\nTL;DR: nEx is wanting to talk about next steps forward in our separation and help paying for my debts. Not sure if trying to get her help is worth it. Looking for guidance.",

Diagnosed with generalized anxiety three years ago, and my doctor noted some slight OCD tendencies at the point of diagnosis. Been taking Zoloft since then and I feel like it keeps most of the anxiety at bay, but the intrusive thoughts are taking over.\n\nSo, my intrusive thoughts aren't what most people's seem to be. No violence, self harm, unwanted sexual thoughts, etc. They focus almost exclusively around whatever makes me happy being \"wrong\" and that I should feel guilty and ashamed about it. For example, if I like flirting for its own sake regardless of where it does or doesn't end up going and find it a whole lot less stressful than consciously putting myself down a finding-a-relationship path at this point in time, I'll constantly think about how invalid of a choice that is and that I'm just a huge whore and everyone will find out and judge me for it. Not exaggerating. I wouldn't cast this kind of judgment on anyone else, just myself. I'm assuming at least some of it draws back to the chronic invalidation and judgment of my Ns, that whatever I liked or did was automatically terrible because I liked or did it, and if people they liked did/liked the same things, then it was fine by them and my mind picked up where they left off and deeply ingrained it into my negative self-talk. It's so hard to explain to my few trusted loved ones, because I feel like they think the sadness and uneasiness I express when giving an example (like the flirting, but it's not limited to that specific one) means that I'm uncomfortable with that action when I'm not - I'm wildly uncomfortable with allowing myself to feel comfortable in my choices.\n\nI'm not really asking for help or anything, since I know what I need to do (mindfulness and meditation - SO hard!) but I guess I just wanted to vent and see if anyone could relate to this specific flavor of intrusive thoughts because it can be so isolating. Of course, any anecdotes or suggestions are welcome!",

In fact, this particular individual had helped me where family members and supposed 'friends' weren't there. I ended up living with this man after my narcissistic mother made living at home feel extremely hostile. \n\n\nThe relationship did not begin to get abusive until right around thanksgiving, and especially after I had an abortion, which was one of the worst, but necessary, decisions in my life and one I will never choose to make again. There were many times where I wanted to leave but was unable to due to inability to find a job, lack of work and lack of finances. There was a time I managed to leave for 2 weeks but went back bc my circumstances were no better, and some relatives I stayed with betrayed me and said and did things to make me feel unwelcoming. \n\n\nThe month prior to leaving was hell. I was forced to do things against my will, didn't have much of a life or any one I can turn to. My abuser tried to get me pregnant again to no success. I finally got a one way ticket to nyc but not without doing a number of ridiculous things and being told false promises. Had only 90 dollars to my name of the supposed 200-300 I was to get. Along the long bus ride I got about 30 from two different ladies. Leaving behind a cat I had for 2 years at that point was the most difficult thing to do. To this day I still grieve for him. \n\n\nI spent time in two youth shelters and working full time temp jobs in the factory where 95 percent of my coworkers did not speak English. However, looking back, I was excited to be working and grateful. I made some questionable choices along the way but I eventually managed to get into a highly competitive year long Lpn program which I am still finishing. \n\n\nI would definitely say that it was the grace of god that lead me into all these good things. I had ptsd which lasted a few months. It subsided when I acknowledged what occurred for that year which was hard, but helped me move along. I never got into drugs or alcohol but I did have some anger issues which caused me to miss out on an opportunity. There's never been any other time in my life where opportunity has happened faster. \n\n\nI am definitely grateful for this reddit and sister subreddits as it lead me to the advice which enabled me to leave for good. I also highly recommend the YouTube channel what's wrong with Kris. \n\n\nSupposedly, my abuser has lung cancer, which I can't confirm, but I suppose I'll know that for sure a few years down the road if I see an obituary for him. \n\n\nThanks for reading.

        "text": "Hi guys!  SO I had one of those extremely withholding childhoods where wanting anything, even if it was cheap/free/good for me, was selfish and denied big time.  I am now totally free and independent and in the Treating Myself phase--library card!  Video games!  Colored pencils!  Clothing that fits!  And that's cool!!  But I'm trying to find some more things to help me make up for the baby-to-college years of my life being miserable, scant, and lonely.  At first I thought I could only live forward, but certain things make me feel like I'm filling in the joy gap in my past as well.  If that makes sense?\n\n\n  It's hard to figure out what we missed because we missed it, right?  SO I thought maybe we can all say what things helped us feel like we were making up for lost time, and compare!\n\n\nHelpful things for me:\n\n-90's movies I didn't get to see (Scream, Princess Diaries) WITH popcorn and soda\n\n-Theme parks\n\n-Journalling\n\n-Video games with an emphasis on school/socialization (Persona, Life is Strange, A Labyrinth Called School probably)\n\n-Let's Plays (like having friends but easier)\n\n-Clothes I always liked (pleated skirts woo!)\n\n-Teddy bear (AMAZING)\n\n\nFuture ideas:\n\n-Putting a pedal powered headlight on my bike (I just always wanted one)\n\n-Going back to school/getting a job in the field I've always been interested in (????)\n\n-Making friends (??????????)\n\n\nSo yeah, what are yours??  And if you know more 90's movies or video games along those lines please let me know :)",

        "text": "You can easily detect a psychopath. You know to stay away from them and you have good reasons for keeping away. \n\nThe covert narcissist often has many positive attributes, despite their lack of empathy, how they abuse, exploit, manipulate, etc. They are frequently intelligent, passionate, charming, sociable, funny, likable, popular, talented... but they will treat you horribly (no one knows, everyone else thinks they're awesome) and make you feel like you're the crazy one. They know how to manipulate you so that the abuse feels self-inflicted. Even after therapy, many months or years of NC, they still cross your mind because there's still some abstraction of who you thought they were in your head, that you can't entirely let go of. It takes knowledge and awareness of NPD, support, therapy, courage, very strong will, etc to leave them and keep away from them for good, and so many don't reach that point, or they break and go back. Unfortunately, the world is a playground for the covert narc, full of endless numbers of potential co-dependents, playthings, followers, people with low boundaries/low self-esteem, exes to poke and prod at, or exes waiting in the wings, etc. \n\nI really think covert narcissists out in society are often more dangerous than psychopaths sitting in jail. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

        "text": "We broke up over 2 years  ago and I've been in a healthy, normal relationship (I hope) for 1.5 years, but sometimes when I try to imagine my current boyfriend, I see my nEx instead. Sometimes in my imagine he has his voice or his characteristics and i hate myself so much for it.\n\nI realised awhile back that my grand plan to get myself to where I want to be, it is essentially me still trying to be his perfect girlfriend - thin, musically inclined, can sing, has some interesting talents, has a large circle of friends (so I can hang out with them instead of him... mainly so it's easier to cheat on me cause it was too obvious when he brought girls home and I was there already) and rich enough to buy him all the fancy things he \"deserved\" to have without going into debt (he convinced me to get a credit card and buy him things with it somehow. Still paying it off). Basically a trophy wife/sugar momma deal.\n\nI feel like I'm still under his control and I want to prove to him I'm perfect for him, so he can try to get me back I can then tell him all the things I wanted to scream at him when I realised how manipulated and abused I was and walk away from him forever. I want to make him painfully jealous and regret fucking with me and I worry that it's the only thing motivating me now.\n\nI still have him on loads of forms of social media but I don't want to \"let him win\" by being the one to remove him and his friends. I know it's not helping at all but I just can't let him win when he won so much of my dignity.\n\nI just want to break this conditioning and be able to just get on with my own life. I love my current boyfriend so much but I still treat him like my nEx; reverence on my tiptoes for when he snaps at me, even though he has never snapped at me or has a personality even remotely like my nEx. It's just hard.\n",

        "text": "It has been over a month since I confronted my mother at the parking lot after her shift that I will be moving in with my boyfriend. I didn't confront my dad because he didn't respond to the original email (below) and I also didn't want to deal with him. Prior to this happening, I sent them this over Facebook to their individual Facebook pages since they don't use email: \n\n\"I have to tell you the truth. I have still been dating the guy that you didn’t approve of, (Name), for nearly 1.5 years. I want you to know that he asked me to marry him a few times during the 1.5 years of dating but I always said no because I told him that you wouldn’t like him because he isn’t Turkish. So after I shared about him with you last year and you didn’t want to listen to me talk about him I told him about it. I kept thinking about it, you guys and him, and I wanted to let you know that he asked me to marry him again. He came down this past Thursday and asked me to marry him. This time I said Yes! When I return from the internship with a good job hopefully, I will be moving in with him, after I return in three weeks. If you want to meet us then you can but if you don’t want to meet him then that is up to you but I have made up my mind. I hope to still have a relationship with my family and I hope you do too. \n\nI am your daughter and I love you but I have grown up and found someone that I trust. He might not be someone you expected but he is a good man. He has many great qualities. He has many qualities that remind of both you, mom and dad. I hope you will accept us. I know this isn’t the best way to tell you but I don’t want to argue. I want us to speak peacefully. \n\nI hope to see you guys soon. I hope you introduce you to my fiancé.\"\n\nClarification:\n-I didn't attend an internship at Google. It was the cover I used to leave my parent's home to move in with my boyfriend.\n-My boyfriend isn't my fiance even though he did ask me to marry him casually many times. Neither one of us is ready for that yet. Instead, I used this as a cover because I thought that if my parents ever wanted to connect with us down the road that maybe telling them we are engaged would make things easier for everyone. I say this because my parents come from a traditional background so I didn't want to alienate them.\n\nContinuation...\n\nGoing back to that parking lot I confronted my mother by stepping out of my boyfriend's car which we parked right next to her car. She started crying, she told me that she loves and that she missed me. However, she looked a bit aggressive, her hand was next to her face. I think it took a lot for her not to strike me or something like that. She has never really been abusive but she looked infuriated. She then calmed down but she was distant. She didn't return my hugs and she didn't try to reach out to me.\n\nthe most significant things she said after translation...\n-You ruined everything\n\n-You will regret this (decision)\n\n-You know that I cried last night \n\n-I want you home\n\n-I don't want to talk to you or your father\n\n-I told her that my father sent this creepy image with zombie like parents with a daughter including captions over a facebook message from a new account that my father started which she knew nothing about. \n\nIt read:\"no one will ever think about your well being more than your father and no one will love you like your mother.\nWhich my mom replied with, \"He is right. There isn't anything wrong with what it said. Don't you think so?\"\n\nCurrently, neither one of them has contacted me. The last time I sent a message over Facebook, it wasn't read until a day or two later, one of them (mother or father) replied Never. The question I asked was when do you want to meet up, Saturday or Sunday? I asked this before I went to see my mom after work because I was hoping they would both show up. Also, my younger brother also blocked me on Facebook even though we weren't even friends on Facebook.\n\nHow do I feel?\n\nI feel numb. I am starting to see my mom for what she is. She is settled and doesn't intend to change things with herself or her husband. She would rather protect him than protect her own child. They cut me out of their lives and I have to accept it. I used to think that she was a victim, the enabler, or something. Now, I see that she might have been a covert narcissist all this time or something.\n\nAn aside...\n\nIt is sad but I was watching a new series on investigation discovery while I was typing this. The show: Kiss of Death Season 1 Episode 3. Watching this episode was like watching someone who was living my life. Also, my father is a functioning alcoholic. You wouldn't think he was an alcoholic until you lived with him. Also, my father doesn't use a belt, he uses his own fists/hands to cause abuse or a broomstick. I hope the same thing happens to my parents.",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago and have just healed enough to barely share this.   \n\nShe first left me saying that I wasn't the right person for her. That I don't improve myself. That she's settling. That we're two completely different people. That we don't have any of the same interests.   \n\nWe were in a relationship for almost 6 years, and were just married 2 months ago. Out of the blue she brought up the above points one day. I felt like I didn't do enough. All of the problems were my fault. She didn't even want to try marital counseling because \"her heart has to be in it to do that\".    \n\nI found out a week after she originally told me \"her heart wasn't in the relationship\" that she actually is living with my **now former** best friend who was a groomsman in our wedding. Not only is she living with him, she's sleeping with him. Not that she loves him. Hell, she even admitted to her brother that she doesn't love him. But she is (and was) using him as a [triangulation technique.](https://freefromtoxic.com/2015/05/13/the-4-most-common-narc-sadistic-triangulation-tactics/)   \n\nShe never has apologized to me. She doesn't even feel bad about this situation. And at the end of the day \"she only has herself\". In reality, she was too empty and afraid to even spend a night alone in our apartment.   \n\nI know this is all over the place. I just don't know how I opened myself up to this in the first place. Why anyone would do this. She spent more time planning our wedding than working on our relationship. I was so broken, so devastated, so betrayed.    \n\nI have been looking on the positive side now. Two toxic people out of my life. The potential for a healthy relationship.   \n\nI just don't know how to look for signs in a narcissist. How to make sense of this.  \n\nTL;DR: In a relationship with a narcissist for 5 years. Marry her. She discards me. Is now sleeping with my former best friend and groomsman. ",
