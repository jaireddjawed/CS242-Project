Keep the gloves on until your hands are completely warm again.\n\nI think everyone has had the on-fire feeling of numb fingers being warmed back up again, and it SUCKS.\n\nThis has helped me so much in my years as a shadetree mobile mechanic. Thought I'd share it here.\n\nHaven't had it happen to my toes but I'm sure the same thing will help with feet.",

The discomfort doing the task as a newbie means you are urging your brain to create the neuropathways it needs in order to learn the skill. \n\nExamples:\n\nI (24F) wanted to learn French and I fortunately was able to move to France knowing only a few sentences at the time. I always spoke French in public regardless of how stupid I sounded. Now I am fluent. It was uncomfortable the first year but worth the result after year 3.\n\nI am art driven and love to be creative. 3 years ago I did not know how paint in different styles so I just tried it the ones I wasn’t familiar with. All my work was ugly the first few times and it was incredibly frustrating but I just kept doing it. I didn’t notice until last night how proud I am of my art. I have learned multiple styles and didn’t even notice that I was getting good at them.\n\nJust do the thing that you want to do. If you don’t know how to start, just immerse yourself in the unknown. If you ignore the emotions attached to it, you can keep going. It works 100% of the time but it’s a mind game and that’s the only thing you need to focus on. Your brain will do the rest.",

I googled some way to do it faster, and it told me some ways to melt it, such as place a bowl of hot water in it or use a hair dryer.\n\nIt worked but not as fast as I expected. The hot water bowl only melted the exact place where it was put, didn’t even bother to melt the surrounding area. Then I just used my knife.\n\nInsert it to the gap between the ice and the fridge. Usually you need to create that gap by yourself. I put my knife point on burning fire for around 30 seconds and it became very hot. Then cut a gap and stick the knife in. Ice is not sticky so you can move your knife sideways to disconnect the ice and the fridge. After ice is disconnected, you can actually remove it with your hands, or just press the knife. \n\nAfter a fridge is turned off, the only thing that’s cooling it is the ice itself, so the more ice you have removed, the higher temperature it becomes inside, making it easier to remove the remaining ice.\n\nBesides, if you decide to use any way to melt the ice before removing, you’ll need to deal with the large amount of water. It could mess your floor.",

I’m originally from Romania, been living in Spain for about 2 years with family. Been having a job back home but I quit to come here and figure what I wanna do with my life. I’m 26 years old. I dropped out of high school due to depression, loneliness and lack of motivation . Dropped on my last year and now I only have a diploma for half of high school (inferior level aka 2 years out of 4). I’ve been working hard on learning programming (been studying c++) and I fell in love with it. I want to learn as much as I can while I work on my Spanish and build my portfolio with projects to potentially start job hunting and land something …anything really but now I’m afraid me not having at the very least full high school is gonna bite me hard and I’m afraid of that. The thought of it has been making me feel worthless lately. Any advice is deeply appreciated. If anybody knows what I need to do to finish high school here in Spain or anything else to point me in the right direction or any sort of advice at all I would be forever grateful. I live in El Campello, Alicante. I will post this on a couple of subs as I am desperate and a little scared. I don’t know what to do….\nThank you to everybody that reads this and I apologize for the sad post.",

Even better is that you can set up to automatically deduct however often you want from another account, like checking, AND automatically re-invest. Set and forget.",

        "text": "These have been hard lessons for me, so I am eager to share.\n\n1. Buy within your means. Be sure to include TOTAL monthly cost, including escrow and HOA. Try not to exceed 30% of your income. Being house-poor is no fun.\n2. Try to buy within a deviation of 10-20% of the area's median price. Buying a home in the top 25% means you have a smaller market when it comes time to sell.\n3. Use Google Street View to check out the neighborhood. Are the neighbors' homes well kept? Is the street well maintained? \n4. Pay attention to the sale time and sale amount of neighboring homes. Keep this in mind because someday, you or your kin, will need to sell.\n5. If there is an HOA, check out the HOA rules AND financials. Is the HOA \"broke\"? Are they keeping up the place, or are there warning signs like a crumbling parking lot or broken pool? Are there rules like \"no work vehicles in sight overnight\" that you can't live with? This is one I wish I had paid attention to before buying my last place.\n6. Make sure you keep a \"cushion\" for emergency expenses. Plumbing repairs often come at inconvenient times like holidays. No fun having to have your sewer rodded out at Christmas, or your furnace repaired in a polar vortex, but it happens. Be prepared. If you can't afford to keep a cushion of at least $2k, seriously reconsider purchasing.\n\nOther advice?",
