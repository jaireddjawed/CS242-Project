        "text": "This is the blog:\n\nhttp://simplerspelling.tripod.com/\n\nHis newer posts aren't quite as bad.  Some of the highlights:\n\nhttp://simplerspelling.tripod.com/arc05-3Q.html\n\n&gt; Since most people rhyme \"berry\" and \"hurry\"‚Ä¶\n\nNo they don‚Äôt; such a pronunciation is mostly restricted to Philadelphia and its surrounding areas.\n\n&gt; \"kom\" for \"calm\"\n\n&gt; ...First, I recognize that there is a common mispronunciation of this word as \"kolm\", where the O represents short-O/broad-A, and the L is pronounced. ‚Ä¶ But (a) my American Heritage electronic dictionary does not recognize that pronunciation at all; (b) my Random House Unabridged electronic dictionary recognizes it, but only with a negative usage label: \"spelling pron. k√§lm)\" ‚Äî which means that it is uneducated, a mispronunciation used only by people who don't know what's right ‚Äî and haven't troubled to look it up in the dictionary ‚Äî so allow themselves to be influenced by an absurd spelling to say it wrong;\n\nYup, because dictionaries list something as a ‚Äúspelling pronunciation‚Äù, or don‚Äôt list it at all, it must be ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù /s.  Also, he‚Äôs assuming the father bother merger (which he does alot).\n\n&gt; \"nerish\" and \"flerish\" for \"nourish\" and \"flourish\"\n&gt; There is no OU-sound in either of these words. Rather, both are parallel in sound to \"perish\" and \"cherish\", so should have parallel spellings: \"nerish\" and \"flerish\".\n\nSame issue as the berry/hurry thing\n\n&gt; Some crazy people hav held positions of power in the literary and educational elite of the English-speaking world. They actually inserted silent letters ON PURPOSE, knowing that adding such letters would make English harder to read!  The G in \"foreign\" is a case in point. There was no G in the Middle English version of the werd, nor in the French werd from which it derived, nor even in the Latin werd from which the French ultimately derived! Somebody just popped one in, for no rational reason, and for centuries after, fools and sheep hav retained a stupid, useless, silent-G!\n\nHe‚Äôs right that foreign didn‚Äôt always have a G, but the claim that the G was inserted just to confuse people I'm fairly sure is BS.\n\n\nhttp://simplerspelling.tripod.com/arc04-3Q.html\n\n&gt; \"muve\" for \"move\" The letter combination O-V-E would ordinarily be pronounced with a long-O, as in \"cove\", but is also pronounced as tho UV (as in \"above\") and UVE (as in \"prove\"). Why so many pronunciations for one combination? Let's remove all doubt as to which pronunciation is intended in \"move\" by changing one letter:  \"muve\".\n\nBut now that adds doubt about whether it‚Äôs /muv/ or /mjuv/\n\n&gt; \"nich\" for \"niche\"\n\n&gt; \"Niche\" rhymes with \"rich\", not \"fiche\". \"Rich\" is from Old English, so has always been part of the English language. \"Niche\" was borrowed from French, but the borrowing was so long ago, 1611, that it has been fully \"naturalized\", so does not take the French pronunciation (neesh). \"Fiche\" (short for \"microfiche\") was borrowed from French recently (1951), and has NOT been fully naturalized, in part because it would then become a homonym for \"fish\", as in tuna. So \"fiche\" is \"feesh\" and \"niche\" is \"nich\". Keeping an E on the end of \"nich\" misleads people into thinking it is still French. It's not. It's English:  \"nich\".\n\nLots of people (including me) use the traditional pronunciation (‚Äúneesh‚Äù).  Many dictionaries list it too.  Also, the correct term here is *homophone*, not *homonym*\n\n&gt; And \"aunt\" is often mispronounced as tho spelled \"ant\", which produces a needless homonym that's rather insulting to your mother or father's sister! So let's rewrite these words sensibly: \"muther\", \"bruther\", and \"ont\".\n\nHow can the ‚Äúant‚Äù pronunciation be incorrect, when it‚Äôs the more conservative pronunciation, and is so widespread?  Also, the ‚Äúont‚Äù spelling doesn‚Äôt work for people with the father-bother distinction (which is very widespread)\n\n&gt; The British also peculiarly mispronounce \"lieutenant\" as tho spelled \"leftenant\"\n\nOf course the American pronunciation is the correct one ‚Äì he‚Äôs American\n\nhttp://simplerspelling.tripod.com/arc04-4Q.html\n\n&gt; \"wor\" for \"war\" \n\n&gt;\"War\" rhymes not with bar, car, and far, but with or, nor, and for. It would seem reasonable to change the A to an O to make that plain: \"wor\". But there's a hitch. One oft-used derivative of \"war\" is \"warship\", which would become \"worship\", which is already a word, pronounced w√©r.ship. Tho we can certainly offer \"wership\" (and do, at February 13, 2005), confusion would still exist between old spellings and new. So let's instead adopt the pattern of aura, centaur, and laureate. This has the added advantage of making war a \"four-letter word\": \"waur\".\n\nNot badling, but which does he want: \"wor\" or \"waur\"?\n\nhttp://simplerspelling.tripod.com/arc06-1Q.html\n\n&gt; Moreover, the sound of the A is ambiguous. In many words, AR is pronounced as in bar (broad-A, or short-O: same sound)\n\nBroad A and short O refer to two different historic phonemes that have merged for most North Americans (father-bother merger), but that are still distinguished by almost everyone else.\n\n&gt; We can, however, leave the U but replace the O with an A, as to show the AU-sound (as in haul, auditorium and aura), which is what most people say in both \"mourn\" and \"morn\".  Some people may insist that the vowel they perceive in \"mourn\" is more like a long-O, but it really is not possible to say a long-O in the same syllable with a following-R.\n\nIt‚Äôs very possible (and a couple centuries ago, before the horse-hoarse merger became predominant, the norm) to use the long-O here.  I have a long-O in ‚Äúmourn‚Äù, which is identical to the long-O in ‚Äúcold‚Äù, and distinct from the vowels in ‚Äúmorn‚Äù, ‚Äúaura‚Äù, and ‚Äúhaul‚Äù",

You probably don't care about Early Proto-Tocharian. \"\n\nSo every Slavic language other than Polish, Russian and Serbo-Croatian is utterly dead and obscure. Right. To give the author a break, he later commented \"The chart cuts out a whole pile of languages! Apologies to the missing. I picked a summary rather than comprehensive, to show just how widely the family goes. A comprehensive chart of Indo-European would be very, very big.\". OK. But this already shows he probably does not have a grasp of linguistics as good as he thinks.\n\n\"There seems to be something about PIE that sits well with the human brain.  It appears to be a very good language for thinking about mathematics and physics.  If you exclude all the progress made by PIE speakers, which means everything achieved by Greek, Germanic, English, Sanskrit, Hindi, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian speakers, then there's not a lot left.  That might perhaps be an issue of cultural domination rather than linguistic advantage, but even so it's remarkable.\"\n\nSo the Japanese, Chinese, Dravidian, Egyptian, Arabic etc... cultures never did anything for humanity, because their language is not as good for mathematics and physics? Like say, Arabs did not know math or invent the presently used number system? What about early Egyptian machines?\n\n\"PIE was highly inflected, and that might be part of its strength.  You can say an awful lot in a few words.  Linguists originally thought PIE must have been somewhat like Sanskrit, because grammatically it's one of the simpler members of the family, but they now know it's the other way round.  Sanskrit is one of the most advanced members because it's simpler.  PIE was grammatically complex.\"\n\nThat is why English and Chinese speakers never did anything notable. Because they speak languages with little inflection (disregarding English is an IE language).\n\nI think this is self explanatory badling, in short, the author implies the spread of PIE was so wide because it is somehow superior to other languages, and it is better for thinking about maths and physics, which explains the success of the Western civilization, ignoring all the others.",

        "text": "Facebook-post in Finnish:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mikael.jungner/posts/10154945915177089\n\nRough summary:\n\n&gt;Finnish, with only 6 mil. speakers, is too small a language in today's world. This results in a burden for its speakers.\n\n&gt;It limits job opportunities, for example. There are few demanding careers where knowing only Finnish is sufficient.\n\n&gt;This burden shows in other ways as well. Finnish has significantly fewer words than languages like English, which limits thought. On the other hand, Finnish is also a slow language to evolve. It is because of this that concepts of foreign origin, like globalization, digitalization, brexit etc., are harder to grasp for Finns.\n\n&gt;The great majority of human thought happens outside of Finland, and only a part of it gets translated into Finnish. We become ignorant of great many things because of Finnish.\n\n&gt;Digitalization worsens this language burden set upon Finns, even though machine translation does lighten the load. The next phase of digitalization will be based on language (speech recognition, big data), and Finland is going to fall behind because of the way the Finnish language is structured (word endings).\n\n&gt;Finnish is dear to me. At the same time, I see the burden that we give to our children through our mother tongue. What gives us nostalgia prevents our children from fulfilling their dreams. A steep price for just nostalgia.\n\n&gt;What should we do then?\n\n&gt;- invest in machine translation for Finnish\n\n&gt;- reform Finnish grammar by, for example, reducing the number of word endings in order to make it easier for computers to understand\n\n&gt;- make English an official language and have it be a mandatory subject starting from preschool.",
