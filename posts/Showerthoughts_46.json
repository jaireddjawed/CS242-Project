Now, some studies have suggested that constant phone use can lower iq as well, and even if this isn't true, try opening TikTok... trust me, you'll come out dumber. Not to mention the legalization of weed (at least in some places) which, especially with young people, can lower iq.\n\nMy overall point is that something has always lead to human intelligence being limited, so while we can talk about how stupid we've gotten, the other generations have had the same problem.
