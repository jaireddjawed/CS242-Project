I've just finished applications to various PhD programs, and I've just been thinking ahead to the future (hoping for the best!).\n\nI know grad students mention being extremely busy, but I was wondering if any of you current and former grad students were able to get involved with extracurricular activities, hobbies, clubs, etc.? \n\nOne of my biggest regrets from my undergrad was not getting involved enough on campus. With schoolwork, work, commuting, and getting married, I didn't find much time to get involved, but I do know that I stuck to what I considered to be my priorities, and I'm happy about that.\n\nIf I get into a PhD program, I'll be focusing on that full time without having to work a part-time job, so I'm hoping to manage my time and get involved with a group or club that means something to me, but I won't know what that is until I get there.\n\nI've seen quite a few people struggle with loneliness and mental health during grad school, and I'm hoping that getting involved with people beyond my program will provide a healthy change of pace. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!

But a student of it.**\n\n**Maintain and grow your motivation, stamina, resourcefulness, dedication, and**   \n**willingness to give it your all EVERY time.\"**\n\nMORE INSIGHT:\n\nShow up as an emotionally stable, mature professional with a strong interest in the field you're studying. Fake it if you have to ( I did). Be passionate and persistent in all of your work. Talk with your professors, so they know who you are. \n\nDon't assume you're owed anything. Don't assume at all. Seek out the facts, and don't rely on anyone else's word for it. \n\n  \nYou're going to have a lot of self-doubt and question why you're on this path and if you really want to keep going. It won't seem fair.   \nYou'll feel frustrated and angry at the fact that you're studying the way you always have, but you aren't seeing those high scores as you expect. \n\n  \nYou'll blame the professors for putting together half-assed PowerPoint presentations on a topic and then designing an exam as if the topic was lectured in great detail.   \nYou'll be so tired of being rushed through extremely complex concepts...they're cramming too much into such a small window of time! \n\nDo the extra work. It's a FULL-TIME JOB, and there is always work you need to be doing. \n\nHere's the kicker, though... you're working for yourself.   \nThe time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears you spend on this is for your own benefit.\n\n  \nMake a schedule and stick to it. It will take you half the semester to figure out a schedule, though, so be patient with the process as you're finding your footing in a new world. You'll have to learn the hard way what methods work and what needs to be tweaked.   \nSeek opportunities to network outside of your program to exercise your resourcefulness. They all talk amongst themselves, and it will be noticed.   \nPay attention to your body and respect its needs.   \nIt will let you know when you truly SHOULDN'T put in those extra 3 hours of studying tonight but get 3 more hours of rest instead. \n\nIn the end, you get what you give.   \nIt is a fight with yourself and for yourself.   \nA good program will transform you into a better reader, listener, investigator, and leader.  \nThe growing pains are real.   \n\n\nI'm taking all the hard lessons I learned this semester with me into the next.\n\nIt's yours for the taking or leaving :)",

        "text": "I don't know if it's end-of-year grading and stress, and I'm a TA and that's compounding it, but I really can't tell if I'm unhappy, just stressed, or both honestly and I need advice from people who've done or are doing this. This is an advice post + vent.\n\nI'm in a humanities PhD; QE year is coming up.\n\nI'm falling apart mentally. I took a job this semester (only 10 hours a week) working for an institution that my primary advisor is the chair of (but I don't usually work with him directly; I work with his staff). I am so completely and utterly overwhelmed that I can't eat and I'm constantly crying all the time. Everything just feels overwhelming, and honestly, the only part I'm really gaining any happiness from is teaching, and I don't get to do that very often as a TA.\n\nSo, on my list of things is TA duties, Admin duties for this extra job, and prepping for Comps. I feel like I *should* be able to handle all this right? I haven't even started my dissertation research yet and I feel overwhelmed. Other people have whole families and children; some others have full-time jobs; I *should* be able to handle just these three things right? What kind of failure or weak human being would I be if I couldn't?\n\nI'm seriously thinking of quitting this part-time job, but I have no idea how to broach that conversation with my supervisor.\n\nOn top of that, sometimes I seriously think about quitting the program and my PhD. I did get my master's, but I just feel so overwhelmed at times, and sometimes I just feel like academia isn't for me.\n\nHow I'm feeling: We tend to rationalize things as academics, so I'll do my best attempt at how I actually feel about this situation: the Imposter Syndrome is strong, especially coupled with my advisors telling me that I need more confidence to be able to articulate myself (this has just made the idea of doing Qualifying Exams feel impossible); stress gives me physical symptoms that feel like death--heart palpitations, can't breathe, crying, chest pain, vomiting (literally need to vomit right now), loss of appetite; when I think about the end goal, getting a PhD, it seems wonderful! I know that it would actually benefit the field because the group I study is incredibly underresearched and I feel a moral/ethical/personal obligation to finish.\n\nI'm *lonely*; I started at the height of COVID when everything was on Zoom. I have maybe one cohort friend and no romantic partners or anything; I feel like life is just passing me by at 27. But when I think about a future in academia...I just don't see it for me. I know having a PhD from a relatively prestigious university could open doors for me to other avenues, but academia itself, and the prospect of having to spend another 2-3 years is achingly despair inducing.\n\nBut then there's the looming question of: will I regret it if I quit? And I truly can't answer that. I suppose no one can. The thing is, I don't know what I'd *do* if I quit. I'm at a crisis crossroads as a recently-turned-27 year old lonely female and everything just seems daunting. Yes, I will go talk to my therapist about this, but I'm asking you guys, when did you know you wanted to quit vs. if it's just stress that'll pass? What am I missing here with this narrow stress-induced perspective? How do I know if I'm truly unhappy or if it's temporary?\n\nTLDR: Overwhelmed with stress; lonely; imposter syndrome; uncertainty; don't know what the hell to do.",

        "text": "I just need to vent, but kind input is welcome.\n\nFirst of all, I understand that many people need longer than 2 years to complete their MS. Producing a good quality thesis is important. However, trying to graduate in 2 years shouldn’t be blasphemous, and that’s what I’m dealing with. Not only that, but there is a balance somewhere between having an absolutely perfect thesis that takes 3.5 years and having a decent thesis in 2 years. At this point in my life I would rather have a decent thesis in 2 years and I don’t think that’s unreasonable.\n\nMy dad died this passed July. We were very close and I have almost no drive to do anything in life. I’m struggling and my mental health and energy is dwindling. It’s a miracle I haven’t withdrawn from school altogether. I am now pregnant and due next July. School is an hour commute and it has taken its toll (literally, it’s $12 round trip). I’m simply not willing to continue to next Fall in these conditions and with a newborn. It was different back when I was full of life and motivation but everything has changed.\n\nThe issue is mostly with my advisor. He’s completely absent. He notoriously ignores my emails and doesn’t hold office hours or anything reasonable. He’s been on medical leave for a few months and has been inaccessible, but I assure you he was no more accessible before. He hasn’t even looked at my proposal despite the fact it’s been done since April and sampling is already done. I’ve relied on the co-PI who is actually present and hands on, but her hands are also tied and she can only do so much to help me since she isn’t my advisor. She’s the one who told me she has concerns about me being able to graduate.\n\nShe also really wants me to take my time and have a good thesis. This was a very high impact study on a threatened species and has legal implications (at least the main study does, not necessarily my thesis portion of it). I understand I should do a really good job and I don’t want to disappoint her. She knows all about my struggles but no one truly understands grief and the weight it causes until it happens to them. I’m a pretty good science writer, and I think I can produce a pretty decent thesis, but I just feel like no matter how efficient I am it’s going to boil down to things outside my control like my advisor and committee members not being timely and my co-PIs high expectations.\n\nJust to add another complication, I do want to pursue a PhD if I don’t work or stay home with baby for a while. I view a PhD program more as a job anyway. There’s only one program I’m applying for because it’s very close to home, it’s a prestigious university, it pays decently, and the PI is really great. It’s the only program that will be worth the struggle. However my acceptance hinges on me winning the NSF fellowship. My understanding is that, if I win, I have to enroll in that school in the fall. This is another reason my co-PI is concerned about me graduating on time. However at that point, IF I do get accepted, there’s no way I would pick finishing my thesis over the PhD that provides an actual stipend and reasonable work conditions. I’ll be 32 with a baby, so yeah.\n\nI don’t know how to make my co-PI and committee understand without having to tell them outright that this MS program just isn’t high on my priority list anymore and I NEED to be done this Spring or else it probably just won’t ever get done at all.\n\nThe only chance I see is IF I don’t get the fellowship (and therefore don’t enroll in the PhD program), my courses are done in the spring, and I quit my assistantship. Then it will just be me and baby and home and I can hopefully work on my thesis virtually and defend in the fall. But even that isn’t ideal. Again, no motivation.\n\nIn fact, deep down I think I might be relieved if I don’t get awarded the fellowship. If I do, I definitely won’t pass up the amazing opportunity at that prestigious PhD program. But if I don’t, what a wonderful excuse it would be to just relax and take care of my baby for a few months without rushing them into a daycare.\n\nI guess I just feel stuck and I don’t want to let people down. And I know my thesis work will be good for my career but I feel so emotionally done with it. It’s hard even imagining completing the spring semester.",

The PI never does much, all daily supervision falls under the work of the supervisor.\n\nI found what I thought would be a nice internship right within my field of interest, but it turns out to be a living hell. The premise is simple. Without giving out to much details, I was expected to do 7 months of animal observations, and I should have 2 months for writing the thesis. However, what they failed to take into account is that the observations are done by video, which must be analysed afterwards. I quickly realised that analysing each video takes about three times as long as it takes to record them. Since I was recording 6 hours a day for 7 months straight, it would take me another 18 hours a day to analyse those videos - aka 24-hour work days (or I would have to take much longer than those 9 months).\n\nAfter a few months of working 120 hours a week, and begging and showing proof that it was impossible to finish on time, my supervisor relented and lessened the work load. I thought all was fine from then on, granted I kept working 120 hours a week, but then I had to do a series of experiments too (non-invasive, don't worry!!! No animals were harmed!!). Due to the legal system in my country, I was not allowed to do those alone. My supervisor had to be in the building with me, to keep an eye on me. Well, he either didn't show up, or actively sabotaged my work. He once even suggested to just break the law and do it alone. So the experiments ended up taking way too long. My supervisor was always absent too, without notifying anyone when or how long he would be gone. The entire research team complained to the PI and the PI just shrugged and was like whatever. All in all, I had massive delays and was unable to finish everything within those 7 months, despite working 120 hours a week (I was not the only student with this issue). \n\nThen disaster struck and I had two family-deaths within three weeks. This time my PI actually stepped in, and asked my supervisor to do the last of the observations. My supervisor promised he would do it. Spoilers, he didn't. So I had to scramble to get the observations finished within time. In the meantime, I had already secured a position for the second internship, and I had planned it reasonable far after the deadline of this internship, keeping the 9-month rule in mind.\n\nThen the fall-out happened. For that second internship, I will have to go abroad to a third world country. My PI wanted me to present my work just after I had arrived there. I was worried about this, considering the internet-connection is unreliable at best. I emailed my PI explaining my worries, and offered some suggestions to solve the problem, because I did not want to waste anyone's time. The PI rejected all suggestions, and said that I had to move the presentation backwards a few months. However, at that point I wasn't sure when I would be back in the country, so maybe we'd only move the problem, plus I'd be completely out of it, so I might not remember important details well. So I said \"Before we make any drastic changes in the schedule, let me talk with my future supervisor (K) first. Maybe she has an idea.\"\n\nHe then changed his tone completely and said \"No, I think it will be better for *your own good* to move the presentation.\"\n\nMe: \"I am not sure I agree with that, sir, but again let me just meet with K first. I will get back to you tomorrow when I know more.\"\n\nHim: \"Well, I am sorry you *completely disagree* with me. You misunderstood me, you *have to* move the presentation back. We can't all dance to your tune. The schedules of the staff and your co-students deserve to be taken into account too. But if you really have a problem with it, come up with some good suggestions then.\"\n\nAt that point I was shocked with the tone he used. I never said I completely disagreed, nor did I mean to force anyone? I opened the email with suggestions to solve the problem? Anyway, I was too exhausted to deal with it, and apologised for my behaviour. But I did have a major panic attack later that day. I have been working 120 hours a week, the deadline is in 15 days, and I am nowhere near finished. Nobody is listening to me, and I feel like my PI hates me. And now I keep beating myself up, thinking that maybe this is all my own fault. Maybe I was lazy, maybe I was selfish...",

I cried a lot, relied on every extension I could possibly get for every class and every assignment, and needed a lot of support.  \n\nBut has grief ever messed with my ability to WRITE. I can casually talk about concepts non stop but when I go to actually produce anything, it’s like there’s a blankness in my mind. I have no words to draw from, no memory of my sources, no ability to connect thoughts - it’s like they’re there… but just just beyond my reach.

At the time, I was enduring a few personal issues, including working up to 40 hours/week to pay for tuition.\n\nAt the end of Spring 2022, I discovered a course I wanted to take it was a graduate course only. Funnily enough, the instructor for said course was the same professor I had the previous Fall (the course I got a C- in). I knew my chances were low, but I sent him an email, just briefly going over why I didn’t do better last time, and how I am invested in this other course he’s teaching. I asked if he would let me in, and to my surprise he did.\n\nDespite it being my first experience with a graduate course, I did decently. I earned an 89% homework average which is what made up most of the course grade. I attended office hours semi regularly with course questions and sometimes general guidance on where I’m going. I think despite the C- from a year prior, we have been able to build a rapport with one another. So far, we have loose plans to possibly do an independent study together next year. \n\nThe caveat is that I for sure bombed his final in the graduate course. I prepared decently, and tried my best, but it was effectively a mock qualifying exam, so the questions were very difficult for me with the time constraints. While I should still pass the course, I feel like this looks very bad on me. I didnt bomb anything all semester except his exam. He likes to make them intricate, especially for the graduate courses.\n\nI can’t help but feel like I am corroding my chances with him as a possible recommender. This might also hurt my odds of doing an independent study with him. Am I overthinking all of this? Aside from this professor being a potential recommender, I hate to disappoint after he let me into the class. I should also mention that he already let me into the 2nd part of this course for next fall.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you.",

Out of my professors she knows me the best as a student; I figured that because of this she would give the best and most accurate assessment of my strengths/weaknesses and I wanted to view this feedback for future applications due in February. We talked several times after i sent the letter request and the waiver wasn’t mentioned by either of us so I assumed it wasn’t affecting what she was writing. \n\nI realize now that this logic was dumb, that professors and admissions committees generally regard this mistake with suspicion and that I can’t even access the letter anyway. I should have looked into this decision before applying, not after. I should have been more transparent with my professor about this. but what’s done is done. \n\nI was hoping to get a census from y’all about the weight of this mistake because I’m seeing mixed opinions in older threads. Some say it’s a deal breaker, some say it will hurt but not kill chances of admission. I would like to think it’s the latter but I’d like some honest feedback. Any input at all from ppl with a similar experience is much appreciated!",

About two days ago, they were sending me emails about an incomplete grade as they hadn't sat for the final exam and had gotten a zero for it. She also didn't turn in the final paper and also got a zero for that. \n\n On both my syllabus and in-class, I have stated I don't do incomplete and rarely have make-ups for exams or assignments and advised her to take her doctor's notes to the student services office in order to see if she would get a medical withdraw. \n\nApparently, she had already done that and they told her they couldn't do that as she already used up the medical withdraw credit limit during quarantine. I then emailed her back and told her that I was sorry she was going through a tough time, but that I couldn't help her anymore. She had missed the final, the zero would remain, and she is just going to have to use this F as a learning opportunity to not take so many classes with all the health problems she has if she can't keep up with the work.\n\n She then messaged me back about having to take all those hours due to a scholarship she has. At this point, she was really starting to get on my nerves with all this emotional manipulation, and I reminded her that it was her choice to choose to come to a university that was outside of the funding her loans give her and that she couldn't pin this on me. I was upfront about there being no chances for an incomplete at the start of the semester and she still choose to go through with the class knowing how her disability is. I also reminded her that her disability accommodations do not include make-ups or turning in assignments late so she should probably contact them to have that changed to avoid this sort of situation in the future. \n\nThen this morning I got the email about what had happened. At first, it didn't really phase me but now I am starting to get worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass. I have never been in this situation before but I am now scared the administration for my department might attempt to blame me for it. I'm now just finishing up my final grades and I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nFuck, I really did not need this right now.”",

        "text": "I'm a student in economics. We have a pretty well-defined and rigid job market structure. It roughly looks like this for most departments (other econ folks, feel free to chime in):\n\n* Students have a \"job market paper\" (JMP) that is their primary research output from their time in the program. It is often the chapter(s) of your dissertation that is the most novel, interesting, or shows off your technical skill.\n* In the spring/summer of the year *prior* to your graduation, you tell your department that you intend to graduate.\n* That fall, your draft of your JMP is due to your committee. They review it and offer feedback, as well as indicate whether they think it is sufficient for getting you a job.\n* In November/December, applications for positions are due. You apply to approximately seven million jobs. Some early interviews may occur for non-academic positions.\n* In January, the Allied Social Sciences Associations (ASSA) meeting occurs; this is where many job seekers get the chance to show off their work, as well as receive\ninterviews from tentatively interested departments. There are other meetings for non-US jobs that occur at different dates, such as the European Job Market.\n* In late January, February, and sometimes March, departments host flyouts for their top candidates. During flyouts, you present your JMP, receive feedback, and the department determines whether or not to give you an offer.\n* Most people know what they're doing by March or April; dissertation defense occurs throughout May and June.\n\nIf you're applying to non-academic positions, the calendar is slightly accelerated, but it still looks roughly the same. I had assumed that all academic fields did the same up until I had a conversation with someone in a different field, and they basically explained that you're more or less on your own the whole time.\n\nI'm very curious to hear what your field's job market looks like, and what you think its strengths or drawbacks are.

This research institute fascilitates PhD students and I have already started preparing for my PhD with my supervisor. I'm very excited to start and have applied for funding with my supervisor already. \n\nThe only issue is, that the institute can't formally award degrees. It allows students to be registered anywhere in the world and work in the institute however. This is where I'm having trouble. I know that I can more or less hit the ground running in September working on my research but without a secondary advisor I won't be awarded a degree without the backing of a university.\n\nMy work is on string theory and can be done remotely. In fact most of the collaborators my supervisor works with are remote. I would like to have a secondary supervisor who is best suited for the particular work I do and have been trying to contact academics around the world asking if their university has an option of doing a PhD remotely, checking in with my secondary supervisor over video call to ensure research is proceeding according to plan.\n\n\nWhen seeking advice all my professors stressed the importance of choosing a reputable university for my PhD for career reasons so I would like to register at a university that's ranked higher than the one where I done my masters/bachelors since that would be advantageous and expected if I wanted to make a name for myself in research circles. The problem is that the university i went to was the highest ranked in my country so if I'm to \"go up\" so to speak, I have to look abroad.\n\nWorking in the institute would be perfect for me because I have family obligations here. I don't have the financial ability to move and live abroad not to mention the fact that I have people who depend on me here. Perhaps my funding can fascilitate occasional in person visits to my secondary supervisor, but a full move would be very costly.\n\n\nI'm based in Europe and have a Bachelors and masters degree, so I won't need to register for a program with an integrated master's in theory. I say this because as far as I know the situation in the US is a lot different than the situation in Europe which I'm aware of. \n\n\nI wanted to know if anyone here knew any universities who might fascilitate this kind of supervision? I understand that it's a very specific line of questioning and I may be being very vague, but I'm very lost right now. I want nothing more than to just do my PhD but there are so many hurdles in the way of it. I'm very confused by the world of doctoral research. I'm from a working class community where a large proportion of people don't finish school let alone college, so I have zero idea what I'm doing and have just been fumbling my way through.\n\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this any and all advice is appreciated.",
