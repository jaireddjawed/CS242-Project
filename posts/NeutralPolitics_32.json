Steve Coll makes a quick mention about how Representative Wilson convinced an unspecified committee during a particular crucial funding vote. \n\nMy questions are whom in Congress gets to approve this kind of funding? And what measures, if any, does Congress take to prevent the media from discovering these votes?\n\nWhile I am particularly interested in this specific time period of US history, if someone has a great example from a different time period and/or involving a completely different secret project, I still love to hear about that as long as it addresses my questions about congressional involvement. \n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

        "text": "The Unite the Right rally was a gathering of far-right groups to protest against the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from August 11th-12th.  The official rally was cancelled due to a declaration of a [state of emergency] (https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=20924) by Gov. Terry McAuliffe on the 12th.\n\nDespite this declaration multiple reports of violence surfaced both before and after the scheduled event [2] (http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/12/542982015/home-to-university-of-virginia-prepares-for-violence-at-white-nationalist-rally) [3] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-protest-white-nationalist.html).  19 people were injured and one woman was killed when a car crashed into a [crowd of counterprotesters] (http://www.wcnc.com/news/clashes-erupt-as-thousands-descend-on-charlottesville-for-unite-the-right-rally-counter-protest/463871802).\n\nToday President Trump made comments equating the [demonstrators with counterprotesters] (http://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543743845/another-reversal-trump-now-says-counterprotesters-also-to-blame-for-charlottesvi).  \n\n&gt;\"Ok what about the alt left that came charging — excuse me. What about the alt left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? Let me ask you this, what about the fact they came charging, that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.\"\n\nGovernor McAuliffe made a [public statement] (http://www.nbc12.com/story/36142848/gov-mcauliffe-releases-statement-regarding-pres-trumps-press-conference) disputing the President.\n\nHow accurate were these remarks by Trump?\n\n---\n\nMod footnote: I am submitting this on behalf of the mod team because we've had a ton of submissions about this subject.  We will be very strictly moderating the comments here, especially concerning not allowing unsourced or unsubstantiated speculation.\n",

They arguably lionize secession and slavery, not necessarily in that order. The counterpoint is that they also make it difficult for Americans to forget important and violent divisions that nearly tore apart the country. \n\nIn Germany, they likewise have a violent and disturbing history: the Holocaust. They're not direct parallels, particularly since the Nazis don't track any sort of regional pride, but they have a shared quality of being ugly and generally discomforting to think about. They present an almost palpable part of each country's history.\n\nGermany [decided]( https://www.thelocal.de/20161019/how-germany-remembers-the-holocaust-world-war-two-nazis-jewish-history-germans) it was in its peoples' [best interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/10colwe.html) to [memorialize](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/member-countries/holocaust-education-remembrance-and-research-germany) the failings of German society in confronting the forces leading to the Holocaust, and requires its citizens and visitors alike to confront its existence.\n\nWould there be a public policy interest in the US to enact similar memorials to the tragedy of slavery, i.e. create public memorials and statues to the assorted depravities of American slavery? What would be the counterarguments?",
