Gary Karkofsky has always wanted to be a supervillain and finally gets his chance when he finds a magic cloak once belonging to the city's greatest superhero.

        "author": "CT_Phipps",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/zby55s/book_review_miskatonic_university_elder_gods_101/",
        "text": "[https://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/2494-miskatonicuniversityeldergods101](https://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/2494-miskatonicuniversityeldergods101)  \n\n\nMISKATONIC UNIVERSITY: ELDER GODS 101 by  Matthew and Michael Davenport is something I've seen before in books  like Anna M. Pillsworth's SUMMONED and Serra Elinsen's AWOKEN but is  always a pleasing concept to me: Young Adult Cthulhu Mythos fiction.  Just like I love the Hunger Games for being horrifically traumatizing  about child murder and PTSD, I love the thought about teenagers dealing  with sanity bending horrors that will rip out your spine while sucking  your soul into unfathomable dimensions.\n\nTechnically, Miskatonic University: Elder Gods 101 isn't Young Adult  fiction. Its protagonists are all eighteen years old and freshmen at the  aforementioned Lovecraft-created university. They're all fresh faced  and (mostly) innocent people more concerned with their studies as well  as making friends versus drugs or partying, though. Which is the most  unbelievable element of this book involving Miskatonic University as a  lodestone keeping reality from drifting into other dimensions.\n\nThis takes place in the same universe as Matthew Davenport's other  HPL-inspired writings like the Andrew Doran series (who gets a name  check) and The Trials of Obed Marsh. Which is to say it is a Pulpy good  vs. evil sort of place rather than particularly cosmic in its horror.  That's not a bad thing as I have no problem with the Ghostbusters or  Justice League punching the Big C in his squid-dragon face.\n\nThe premise is our heroes are secretly brought to the campus under  false pretenses. All of them are descendants of HP Lovecraft characters  ranging from Herbert West to the Whateley Family to a child of that  delightfully fishy Innsmouth place. The students of Miskatonic  University supposedly are in the dark about the supernatural but some of  them are quite well-informed. At least enough for there to be a running  prejudice from Innsmouth and its reigning sports team, the Chompers.\n\nSome people may object to how much the book lowers the cosmic horror  of the Mythos to comic book level and closer to PG urban fantasy than  R-rated horror. The threat of life in Innsmouth is more being forced to  partake in marriage when you're gay as well as sticking to  fundamentalist religion over the horror of inhuman transformation or  sacrifice. Indeed, our fishy protagonist sees nothing weird about  becoming a fish man and it comes with Aquaman-esque superpowers.\n\nStrangely, if I were to say which author this book reminds me of  most, it wouldn't be HP Lovecraft but actually Drew Hayes. Specifically,  his Super Powereds and Villains Code series. The protagonists are  likable but not particularly deep archetypes that are constantly running  into absurd situation after absurd situation. The episodic nature is to  the stories credit, and we get to see with them deal with everything  from time travel to the Wild West to the Cult of Cthulhu in the 21st  century.\n\nI think this is a pleasant afternoon's read or perhaps multiple  afternoons despite being only 250 pages. There's a lot of information  packed into its writing with those with at least a regular Call of  Cthulhu player's knowledge of the Mythos getting the most out of the  in-jokes. Still, none of the references require being a long term fan to  get the general context.",

Or it might be three held in a twine for transport. I am not sure.”\n\nSome dim memory of a conversation with one of his Ranger friends bubbled up in Twistunder’s awareness.\n\n“And where on her body is this extra appendage?” He asked.\n\n“It comes of the back of her,” Flipsalong paused and trembled as she visibly tried to think of the term. “You know, the primary sensory end. With the organs.”\n\n“Ah,” Twistunder nodded as it started to loosen in his thoughts. “Off the back of her head. And is the detached end constrained by a cloth band?”\n\n“Yes!” Flipsalong declared. “Do you know what the appendage is?”\n\n“I am not sure it is an appendage, exactly,” Twistunder said slowly.\n\n“Oh,” Flipsalong drooped in disappointment. “Just an ornamental attachment then?”\n\n“No, no,” Twistunder said. “You probe, you have only touched Rangers and University professors yet I assume?”\n\n“That is correct,” Flipsalong said. “How does that connect?”\n\n“Rangers,” Twistunder said. “Follow a strict policy of grooming. As do most researches who will have to expect to be in an environmental suit. They keep their mammalian fur at a regulation length that will not interfere with the fit of an air tight helmet.”\n\n“That is well known,” Flipsalong agreed, “but how does it connect?”\n\n“Human fur has no standard growth length,” Twistunder explained. “It continues to lengthen until it reaches each individuals genetic maximum. That is why humans are so strict about their length regulations.”\n\n“Wait?” Flipsalong raised a gripping appendage in shock. “You meant that massive appendage is just a compressed mass of sensory tendrils?”\n\n“It isn’t painful I assure you,” Twistunder said, reading the horror in the set of her appendages. “Human fur has no live nerves once past the membrane.”\n\n“So it serves no sensory purpose?” Flipsalong asked.\n\n“A very limited one at best,” Twistunder said.\n\n“Does it offer greater radiation or thermal regulation than the standard Ranger length?” Flipsalong asked.\n\n“I do not believe so,” Twistunder replied.\n\nFlipsalong curled into what the humans called a thinking loaf and pondered this.\n\n“Then why would a human maintain such a mass of useless tendrils?”  Flipsalong demanded.\n\n“Perhaps we should ask the ambassador,” Twistunder offered. “Though you might want to rephrase that question in the interest of diplomacy.”\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6w7ee9p64s3a1.gif",

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 3rd, 2022\n\nWant to know the most sure-fire way to rub someone’s nose in the fact they can’t do something and they’re going to die trying?  Simulations.  I’m not talking one or two here.  I’m talking a hundred.  And none of them were the famous, “let’s see how he handles this!” stuff NASA’s known for.  I’m talking kid-gloved, smooth sailing, everything working absolutely perfectly.  NASA let me spend all day seeing the difference between a big-balled test pilot with thousands of hours of experience, and me, the idiot stowaway.  \n\nLet me put this in context.  A car goes backwards/forwards and left/right. That’s two degrees of freedom.  Orion has six.  It goes backwards/forwards, left/right, up/down, sideways spinny, loopy spinny, and rolly spinny - those are of course the scientific terms.  Remember learning to drive and feeling like the car was a bit out of control?  Three times that.    \n\nBut wait, there’s more!  Pulling off this intercept means I have to arrive at a specific point in space at a specific time, at a specific orientation, and I have to eyeball it.  Too slow, everyone dies.  Too fast, everyone dies.  Wrong place, everyone dies.  \n\nThings get even more complicated though.  In movies all the spinny maneuvers are depicted as using bursts of thrust.  In reality Orion has three flywheels that can spin up, or brake, to impart a rotation.  Those flywheels can only spin so fast though before they are, “saturated” and need to be discharged using precious thruster fuel.  A real astronaut would select between the flywheel or a thruster based on how quickly they need to rotate Orion, how much capacity those flywheels had, and which way they wanted to spin.  NASA’s got me on “automatic” but if I push the stick just a little too hard, or in the wrong direction, the thrusters will engage when I might be able to get the same maneuver for “free”.    \n\nBack to that car analogy.  Think of this all like taking someone who’s never driven, putting four people who’ve been shot onto the back of the car, and telling the student driver he has to race them to the hospital before they die.\n\nThen line the roads there with bazooka and speed gun wielding police officers, so the car blows up if it goes too fast.  The make the car a stick shift with two different steering wheels (one steering wheel for the right two tires, and one steering wheel for the left two tires).  \n\nThat’s still overly simple…  I guess, then imagine this driver is lost and has to use a paper map to try and figure everything out, while driving.\n\nWait, I forgot I’ve got to do it in vacuum without a proper space suit, so let’s set the car’s on fire as well.  Oh, and we’re almost out of gas so every tap of the pedals is precious.\n\nNow, any chance at all I’m pulling this off?\n\nA hundred simulated attempts and I typically doomed myself, and the four people I’m meant to be saving, at the 60% complete mark.  That’s especially bad because the hard bits haven’t even started by then.  The really hard part’s the last 5% or so.  I know that because after the fiftieth try we started running the whole simulation through each time.  Never mind the fuel, I just can’t make the intercept.  \n\nOne really cool thing.  A couple of the engineers stayed up all night and turned a few of the LCD instrument displays into “windows” for the simulation.  So, I get to see four astronauts tethered together drifting up closer and closer to me and then drifting away when I fail to pick them up the way I should.  Mark promises it actually makes it a little easier when it is out of the window.  \n\nYou’re probably wondering why I don’t give up.  \n\nScratch that, you’re probably wondering why I would even have agreed to try and do this in the first place.  Simple, this is full-blown, absolute, astronaut bad-assery.  This is the kind of thing where you kill yourself doing it, and god gives you a pat on the back when you get to heaven and says, “well, you’ve got balls kid, I’ll give you that.”  I risked my life just to get into space, I’m happy to spend it trying some straight up science fiction coolness.\n\nWhen I stop to have lunch I munch on my seventh to last Skor bar.  I’m eating two a day until I pull this thing off.  Turns out starvation + high focus maneuvering, is a bad combination.  \n\nMark cut into my meal over the radio, which he doesn’t usually do.\n\n“There are bold pilots, and old pilots, but no old, bold, pilots,” Mark says.  “How many friends have you lost over the years Alex?”\n\n“None.”  My grandmother had passed a few years ago, and a distant aunt a decade before that, but I don’t think that’s what Mark’s asking about.\n\n“I’ve lost seven.  First one was just after flight school.  Air Force did a pretty good job of getting us all through that alive.  Matthew Troy - Zippy.  God he was a funny guy.  We’d go to this lounge together, fresh out of the cockpits, stinking of aviation fuel, thinking we looked just about as cool as cool got.”  Mark gave a little laugh over the radio.  “Shit, we couldn’t even really afford to drink there, we’d spend hours nursing a drink and Zip would just about kill me with the jokes.  Sometimes we’d get lucky and find a few women interested in hearing pilot stories.  Mostly though we just hung out.”\n\n“I was so pissed with him at his funeral.  I just, I remember wanting to punch the casket.  How the fuck didn’t he recognize hypoxia?  They trained us for that, we’d all gone through it so we could recognize it.  All he had to do was push the stick down and he could have gotten below ten K in thirty seconds.”\n\n“We were both your age.  I eventually figured out that it had been easier to be angry with him than to be afraid.”\n\n“I did some straight up dangerous things in my youth, and shit, at some point or another you realize what you’re doing and the fear hits like a mule.  But when you’re young and stupid you just balls and bravado your way through the warnings until reality bites you in the ass.”\n\nI just listen.  Mark’s marching through this, he’s got something he wants to say and what, I’m going to argue with an astronaut telling me his flying stories?\n\n“You want to know what’s actually going to happen up there Alex?  You’re going to hit bingo fuel, and it won’t be like a movie.  It won’t be a question of just one more burst of the thruster needed to save them and maybe by a miracle you’ve got more gas than we all thought.  You’re going to come close-ish, see that it’s hopeless, and then you’ll do the right thing.  You’ll do what everyone actually does in that situation.  You’ll stop, and live, and let them die.”\n\nMy brain kind of wants me to object, but he keeps going before I figure out what to say.  \n\n“Now you listen to me Alex.  When that happens, you stay on the radio with me.  Don’t go trying to find their suit frequencies.  Don’t watch them drift off from one of Orion’s windows.  When we abort, you keep your eyes locked inside the ship, and you just listen to me ok.   The only thing you’re going to do if you see them drifting off, or hear their voices, is spend the rest of your life having nightmares about that again, and again, and again.”\n\nFuck.  \n\n“If this were just a straight odds thing, what’s got the better chance of working, this rescue or NASA’s plan to send up a mission?” I ask.\n\n“Reasonable people can disagree.”\n\nFuck.\n\n“Let’s keep practicing.”\n\nI’ve never hurt-hurt someone.  I mean, I’ve hurt people’s feelings, and I’ve felt bad about it.  But if I screw this up am I going to feel like I killed four people?  Mark was right, fear kicks like a mule.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 2nd, 2022\n\nI swear to god I was woken up by the Red Alert siren from a Shatner Star Trek movie.  One of my little quirks, I’m not a good waker-upper.  You catch me in the middle of my sleep and whatever dream I was having becomes the initial conditions on reality, and it takes a minute before 1+1=2 again.  \n\nThe alert stops.  I don’t know exactly how long it was playing, five seconds, ten seconds, depends on how long it took to wake me up in the first place.  \n\nOrion’s alarm for radiation was the Apollo 13, airplane cockpit, shrill buzzy kind of thing.  \n\nBut there’s no going back to sleep after something like that, and if for no other reason than to make sure I’m not crazy I “get up” (and by the way if you think it’s hard to get your day started when you climb out of bed, walk over to your coffee machine, and pour yourself a warm cup, you can’t even imagine what it feels like when you’re always, always, just peacefully floating wherever you are, so comfy, so warm, so easy to just close your eyes…  And not a drop of coffee aboard).\n\n“Mark, am I going crazy?  I thought I just heard an alarm,” I said, no need to tell him what alarm.  By the way, do you think Starfleet would change their alarm sound every few decades?  Or like the captain of every ship gets to pick from a list like a phone ring tone?  \n\n“Not going crazy Alex, that shouldn’t have happened, and we fixed it on our end.  Nothing to worry about.”\n\nI’ve only got ten Skor bars left, and I’m really hungry.  Eat one now and be slightly less hungry all day?  Or save it for dinner and fall asleep with a not-totally-empty stomach?  Ahh the glorious choices of space travel.  \n\nI eat the Skor bar.  Future Alex can be angry with me; he usually is.  Speaking of things future Alex is going to be angry with me about.  Aside from another exciting day of septuple checking valves and gauges, I’m going to write Jess a letter.  I know what you’re thinking: ‘Oh Alex no, don’t write a pathetic letter to your ex trying to win her back!’\n\nDon’t worry!  This one is going to be classy!  \n\nRed Alert!  Only the first couple of tones play, and then it’s gone again.  “Mark, just had it go off again.  What’s up?”\n\n“Yeah…” he draws the word out, “we’re working that, Alex.  Nothing you need to worry about.  This one’s a Charlie problem, you’re fine.”\n\nWhy is the flight director working a problem on the ground that I don’t need to worry about?  Why does a non-standard alarm keep going off?  Why isn’t Mark telling me about some error in the ship’s food rehydration system or something bonkers like that?\n\nYou know what I hate?  Rhetorical questions when my life is on the line.  I give the old instrument panel a once over.  Nothing red and blinking leaps out at me.  So that’s good.  The radio controls do have a caution warning.  It’s one of those triangles made of three pieces of string with an exclamation mark inside it, and then X2 besides that.  Just a small icon at the top of the display.\n\nThen it flashes clear.  That’s weird.  So, it’s some kind of radio problem, but I can talk to Mark just fine.  Just a technical error?  But why would a radio sub-system error play the Star Trek red alert sound?  \n\nInteresting thing about rhetorical questions: sometimes they have an answer.  Why would a NASA engineer, someone very much like me, program in a Star Trek Red Alert sound?  Answer: They thought it would be funny.  \n\nNo way that went through an official approval.  This has to be something buried so deep in the radio system’s code that no one even bothered to test it out.  \n\nA problem that even NASA thought wouldn’t come up, and a problem that the engineer working on it thought was funny.\n\nBack to the bible I guess.  If you’ve never seen an index that has three library-dictionary-style pages for “radio” then you’re really missing out in life.  \n\nNo one is ever checking manuals in Star Trek.  No one could possibly know this stupid book back to front.  You always like to imagine astronauts more like the swash buckling heroes of sea stories, but this whole experience feels more like playing the world’s most complicated board game - with a gun to your head.  Can you imagine what the checklists for the Enterprise would look like?  Millions of pages.  Yet no one is ever checking manuals.\n\nThe alarm goes off again!  This time though I look up in time to see a dialogue box pop up on the radio LCD “Incoming Distress…” and it’s gone, alarm squelched by NASA.  A caution triangle appears on the LCD screen, and a second later it blinks away.  Someone down on the ground really has their finger on the trigger.  \n\nRadio plus Distress, oh mighty index of the ship, what wisdom can you bestow upon this lowly stow-away?   Page 3,145.  Nice.\n\nWell, this is a kick in the stomach.  \n\n“Mark, why is the Orion receiving distress calls?”\n\nThere’s a very long five minute’s wait.  Always pay attention to pauses.  They say something.  If the system had a screw loose and was throwing off random incorrect warnings, Mark would have happily spent an hour talking my ear off about it.  That he needed so long to figure out what to say meant it wasn’t that, which meant it was a real distress call and NASA was trying to figure out how to tell me about it.  \n\n“Hey Alex, sorry for the delay,” Mark’s voice came back - finally.\n\n“Not a problem, as long as you tell me what’s up.”\n\nI can feel him sigh over the radio.  “A SpaceX launch for the ISS had a chunk of space debris take out an engine.  The crew saved the ship - minor miracle there, but they’re not going to be able to get to the ISS, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to be able to perform the braking burn needed for re-entry.”\n\n“So, they’re stuck?”\n\n“We don’t know that yet.  They’ve got resupplies for the ISS but would have to do a spacewalk to get the oxygen tanks in their hold, and then they’re not the same fittings for their own systems.  Their orbit isn’t great either but, depending on exactly how much drag they pick up, they could last as long as a month up there.  We’re working with SpaceX, the ESA, even the Chinese space agency, and we think we can put together a rescue mission.”\n\nAlright, so why are they calling me?  “Alright, so why are they calling me?”\n\nLong silence.  “A month is on the very optimistic side of how long they have until their orbit degrades, on the very optimistic side of how long it would take to put together a rescue, and on the very optimistic side of how long they can last with the consumables they have.”\n\n“And I assume they think I could help them. So why don’t we?”\n\n“About a dozen reasons.  The biggest one though is that we don’t have the fuel.  Between making up for correction burns when the computers went down, and what the radiation storm cost us, you’re running very lean.  To meet up with them, and transfer the crew over, would take more fuel than you have.”\n\n“You told them that, and they’re still calling.”\n\n“They have an idea that pulls off the intercept, on paper, but first it would bring you below safety margins for re-entry, still technically above the red line, but we’re talking about your fuel tanks going dry and using up the majority of what’s left over in the piping.  Second there’d be no way around you doing some manual flying.  You’d be making the intercept with them in space suits drifting out to you.  Radar and video are just not accurate enough to handle that.”  \n\n“But that means if you so much as tap your orientation controls one too many times you won’t have enough fuel to re-enter.  Also, their plan has them breathing fumes by the time they get to you.  It’s a four person crew, and they won’t have time to cycle Orion’s airlock four times.  You’d have to depressurize Orion, leave both inner and outer airlock doors open, and fly the ship like that for the whole intercept.  Plus, your flight suit wasn’t great before, and having duct taped it up won’t have done it any favors.”\n\nCan I be honest here?  I’ve always been a bit of a fan of bad-ass last words.  Voltaire was getting his head cut off for blasphemy and on the execution block they asked him if he renounced Satan and all his evils.  Voltaire said, “Now’s not the time to be making enemies.”\n\nHow much of the bad-assery of famous quotes would be lost if you could hear their voices shaking as they said them?  Because Christ, just objectively this was the coolest thing I’d ever said in my life, but I could barely get the words out.  Come to think of it, Neil Armstrong had his own moment of performance anxiety in front of a live audience.  Maybe history is lessened by having video evidence.\n\n“Are you going to help me, or am I doing this on my own?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.
