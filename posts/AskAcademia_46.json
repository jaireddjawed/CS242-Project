        "text": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm a having a small ethical issue about a course I want to take next semester. It's a 400-level course taught by a prof who was accused of doing sexual harassment. Now here's the thing: this accusation was made about 9-10 years ago but because no one (including the victim) know what happened once the university got hold of it (there's a policy that forces the university to not disclose the outcome of a case) nobody knows if this prof was actually guilty or not. This case resurfaced last year at my university because of some other terrible things going on in another department (unrelated to this prof, but the victim decided to go to the media this year anyway). Many students want him to be fired as well (he's tenured).\n\nI don't necessarily need to take this course to complete my degree, but I really wanted to take it because the content is interesting to me. I've also heard that he's a bad teacher (teaches from his own book, etc.).\n\nWhat I'll do is attend the class until the drop deadline to see if I actually like the course (maybe I'll drop because he's actually a bad teacher, I don't know).\n\nBut I wanted to start a discussion here about whether or not you think professors with criminal accusations (sexual harassment especially) should have their professional career completely discredited. The reason I'm also wondering about this is because I want to specialize on an author who is also controversial in my field (was member of the Nazi party, yet his work is quite genius and innovative still). I don't know how I should feel about these things even though I obviously condemn these immoral acts. Should we make a separation between the work of  prof and the person, like we do with artists and authors?\n\nOther relevant information: I'm a guy and this is in the humanities sector. His name wouldn't show on my transcript, so I have nothing to worry about grad school application. I'm purely interested in the morality of this.\n\nThanks.",

I'm a US and UK citizen which I thought would help with my prospective funding, however, what I've since learned is that most UK funding requires 3 years residency and not just citizenship.\n\nWith that said, there is a particular University that I am very interested in attending. Also a few months ago I took a trip out to the UK and visited that school and met with the prospective professor. We really hit it off so now I'm trying to figure out how I can make it work.\n\nFor what it's worth I want to pursue a PhD in Chemistry, I do not hold an advanced degree (just a bachelor's). I've been scanning the internet for funding and most things I find do not apply to me...\n\n1. I don't think I have the resume to get a Fulbright\n2. Research Councils require a 3 year citizenship\n3. Marie Curie scholarships appear to go to recent graduates (I graduated from college in 2014)\n4. Most other options appear to be funding for UK nationals to leave, not for a US national to come in\n\nAny thoughts/tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated! \n\nI found an old Reddit post related to this very same question but the ideas given were not concrete at all ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1vj3lg/uk\\_phd\\_funding\\_for\\_american\\_students/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1vj3lg/uk_phd_funding_for_american_students/)).

Yet I have felt like I'm not doing enough or that I'm not on par with the rest of the lab interns. Basically, I don't know what's expected of me and I don't know what limits I have or don't have. I want to be independent like the rest of the people in my lab. I'm also afraid that if I ask my PI they are just not going to help enough in informing me and are just going to give me a ton of boring things to do. I don't want to be looked down upon because I'm a few years younger than everyone, I don't want special treatment. The next youngest intern is a rising junior in college and she seems pretty independent I believe. A part of me also sort of enjoys sometimes doing nothing in the lab because then I can browse things online. What should I do to become more useful while also being more independent? It's my third year and I am now 18, I want to feel more useful this summer.\n\nThought I should mention. My lab works on animal fear behavior in the brain, so there are surgeries and animal handling involved almost every two days in the lab. ",

I could likely get into a better school, but I wouldn’t be able to start until fall of 2019. My friend in Britain said that in her experience who your advisor is, is more important than the school you go to (she goes to oxford so I question this wisdom given she’s already got a brand name school). My advisor is well regarded in the discipline and the school has had a few very successful years. Any insight into this claim? ",

I do not want to give specific details, but think of it like a national lab. I have been assigned to work on a project under a full time scientist. The project I am working on is, to be frank, terrible and my supervisor is reluctant to make any changes. I am directed to perform dozens of simple hypothesis tests in the pursuit of that golden \"p &lt; 0.05\". If we get a few meaningful results we will backpeddle and try to \"make a story out of it.\"\n\nNormally, I could handle a bad project for a few months, but I'm expected to present my work to all the bigwigs at the agency. I am uncomfortable presenting research of such low quality to accomplished scientists.\n\nI've been doing some calculus on damage control, and I'm considering refusing to present. I would rather make my supervisor angry than embarrass myself in from of a room of people who may have a direct effect on my career: directors at agency, current and former faculty, fellows of the American Statistical Association.\n\nAm I wrong to consider refusing? Can an early career researcher afford to make a poor presentation?\n\nEDIT: My concern did not come through as I intended. My concerns are not with p-hacking as this work will never be good enough to be published. My concern is that I am a trained statistician, and I would do a much different (read: much better) analysis if I was given the opportunity. If I present an extremely simple and incorrect analysis to a group of scientists, I worry they will think that I have performed at my skill level. In reality, I can do much much better than dozens of t-tests, but I was not allowed to do so.",

        "text": "**TLDR**: I am an observer to an interesting development at my school. My engineering department at my school is going to hire someone into a TT position who obtained all of their degrees - B.S.and PhD. - at that school (albeit in a different engineering department), who (in my opinion from interviewing them) has a decently strong record. A group of faculty are highly against the decision on principle and lodged a protest in the academic senate, and they are moving to gain support from faculty in other departments to add a clause to the academic policy and procedures manual that anyone who obtained any of their degrees at the school is ineligible to be hired into any position in a tenure-track series at the school. Curious what people's thoughts are on this.\n\n**Long version**: My department had a call for a TT position last fall, which was a repost of a position which had a failed search in the previous cycle. A bunch of good candidates were interviewed - I was involved in interviewing them since I'm kind of a mainstay in the department although I'm not formally on the hiring committee since I'm not on the academic senate. The hiring committee's first choice (who was also my recommended first choice) declined, and the second candidate is someone who obtained both their B.S. and PhD. at this school and has been around as an adjunct professor for 5 years in the same department they graduated from, but has staked out their own research niche separate from their doctoral advisor. My department (where they are being hired) is different from the department they graduated from and are in currently.\n\nIn my recommendation to the hiring committee after interviewing the candidates, I recommended this candidate as a tie for second choice with one other candidate. The hiring committee decided to go with them. I honestly don't think it's controversial based on my assessment from interviewing them and looking at their CV - they've been publishing a lot even though they don't have their own students, have brought in a bunch of grant money, and their focus area seems to be one that the department wants to inherit. There's the additional pressure to not have a second failed search in a row as well.\n\nHowever, the department vote to hire this person passed but just barely. The candidate's case was then approved by the chair and the provost, so the offer was made. The faculty who voted against them didn't accept the decision, however, so they lodged a protest with the academic senate. Further, they are trying to get support from other departments for preventing something like this from happening again by trying to get it formally written into the academic policy and procedures manual that applicants who obtained any of their degrees at the school are ineligible for consideration for any tenure-track position at the school. It's a lot of drama. I can see that some might not like it on principle and it'd be bad if their record was bad and they were hired anyway, but in this case their record was pretty strong relative to the other candidates. \n\nFortunately I'm not internally involved (I'm non-TT and therefore not on the senate) but it's interesting to observe the magnitude of faculty reaction to this. I feel like if the candidate takes the offer, they'll have the deck stacked against them when going for tenure from the get-go. What do think about this? ",

Moreover, I had no publications, and wanted to take a breather, so I worked as a teacher in a private school as an academic English tutor. Money was good, the job wasn't bad, so I stayed a couple of years. Meanwhile, my thesis was accepted for publication with a good publisher, and has become a monograph this year.\n\nThis Spring, I quit my job for a myriad of reasons including boredom. I would love to go back to academia. I feel I still have things to say in my field. I like teaching, and I have experience, so I've been applying for academic jobs. I just have a nagging suspicion that I'm not good enough with a single monograph under my belt.\n\nWhat are the chances today to find an academic teaching/research job in the humanities for me?

I feel that this sub-discipline is kind of judgemental and requires a level of critical social consciousness that only makes me feel guilty all the time. Also, I really don't think that my work here is going to have any real world effects or help anyone at all except for those in my field. \n\nWhen I started my MA, which also worked with pornography, I was excited about the field because there really isn't anyone doing this kind of research in SA. In the beginning I pursued my PhD with this same enthusiasm and I felt that since it was under researched and never taught I could make a place for myself in the academic market here.\n\nNow I've realised that my interests really lie in forensic linguistics which my university does not teach at all. Thus, I don't have any experience in the field except for the small amount of reading I have been able to do in my spare time. I am a critical discourse analyst and from what I understand these skills should be transferable to forensic linguistics also. \n\nObviously I have to finish my PhD in my current field, I am half way through and I think my supervisor may have a heart attack if I mentioned this desire to change. \n\nMy question is how do I make this change after my PhD considering that my publications and training are all in LGS and sociolinguistics? I am currently attending a conference of linguistics in which there is a forensic linguistics stream which I am attending and I plan to speak to the presenters.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to follow this up and possibly create some opportunities for my change of discipline?\n\nThanks in advance!

My departmental funding runs out on 8/31, and apparently I get kicked out if someone isn't paying for me by then.\n\nI currently have a rotation set up with a professor in a different field that I'm very interested in, but (he is a very nice guy, and was upfront about his concerns) he has expressed some frank skepticism that I'll be able to get up to speed fast enough in the rotation for him to be willing to take me.\n\nI scheduled this rotation when I assumed the second rotation prof would take me and I could take a risk on this different field, but then that fell through.\n\nSo now I'm trying to decide whether to continue trying this rotation, or whether to switch to another lab that's more within my background. I could try the current for a few weeks and then switch if it's not working out, or just switch now.\n\nMy stress levels were at a zero this entire year, and now they've been at 99999 for the past 2 weeks...",

I know it's sometimes seen as \"bad\" to have all your degrees from the same university, but I think it's somewhat less of an issue in engineering. I'm interested in a career in research/teaching.\n\nHere's a quick list of the pros and cons I can think of (I'll keep it updated based on comments):  \n\nPros:\n\n- Save about a year of work\n- Skip thesis writing/defence\n- No need to shop around for schools/advisors/projects\n- Skip (most of) the admission process\n\nCons:\n\n- Big commitment/less flexible\n- will not have the master's degree\n- can't go elsewhere for PhD\n- can't stop/take a break after master's (not that I plan to, but who knows)\n- all degrees from the same university\n- might not get the 6 months of \"work experience\" towards P.Eng from the master's\n \nAny thoughts? Did I miss anything? I'll obviously discuss this with my supervisor, but I'd like some crowd-sourced Internet wisdom first.",

(Now, of course, you’re lucky if you *can get* a waiter’s job, but that’s another story.)  Then quite suddenly everyone was saying the exact opposite.  At the tail end of the decade, every single person I met who had a Ph.D urged me to go to grad school, insisting that there’s going to be a huge glut of jobs in academia.  Sure enough, in 1989, at the orientation of my doctoral program at my distinguished university, the chair of the history department got up and made the following declaration:  “Normally I have the awkward task at these orientations of lauding all that our department readily provides to its students, but then offering a sober assessment of the dismal job prospects that will follow.  But *this* year, for the first time since I’ve become chair, I can safely say that, *barring a major depression*, there will a job waiting for you when you graduate.  Here at our university, nearly half of our faculty in the history department, who had been hired to teach the baby boomers, will be retiring over the next decade, and we plan to replace every retiree with two new faculty members.”  \n\nWell, I don’t remember any major depression in the 1990s, but I certainly noticed that none of those jobs materialized.  In fact, what materialized was a three-year hiring freeze in the mid-nineties and a rapid and unprecedented increase in contingent labor.  The new business model of American academia became rampant exploitation of part-time employees.  \n\nHere are a few questions I’d like tenured faculty to answer:  Just how complicit *are they* in this new business model of those faculty-run institutions of theirs?  How much do *they* benefit economically from the denial of a living wage and benefits to their academic colleagues?  How much do *they* assuage their consciences by pretending that they still function in a merit system in which the best and the brightest get their just rewards?  Do they seriously still believe that when [some 70% of all college profs are non-tenured and 50% are part-time](https://www.aaup.org/issues/contingency/background-facts)?  How do academics who pride themselves on their progressive politics live with their total lack of solidarity with contingent faculty?  Does anyone really think that all of this wouldn’t end tomorrow if the tenured faculty went on strike on behalf of their exploited colleagues?  Did not the UPS workers (those \"uneducated primitives\") do exactly that some twenty years ago?  Why is solidarity possible among UPS workers but not among progressive-leaning academics?   ",

I don't know if I'm hesitating for legitimate reasons or not, which is why I'm posting here. \n\nI graduated two years ago with a degree in Mathematics. After that I've been working in the industry for 2 years but I have been underwhelmed regarding the intellectual challenges and have been wanting to go back to University pretty much ever since I graduated. I have always loved university life and studying, but after getting rejected for a couple of PhD positions during my final year I decided that I probably didn't have the credentials needed and decided to settle for a more regular job.   \nI applied for this position pretty much on a whim a day I was feeling particularly dissuaded from industry life, and a couple of days ago I received an e-mail offering me the position. The offer is for a 4 year PhD in pure mathematics with 25&amp;#37; teaching load. This caught me completely off guard, and now I guess reality has hit me in the face. This feels like a monumental decision and I'm afraid I haven't thought this through.  \n\n\nFirst of all, I sort of just got settled in a new city where I now know a lot of people, while the PhD position is in my old university town, where I pretty much know no one anymore. I'm a relatively extraverted person and I need to interact with friends and acquaintances to feel good, so I'm sort of dreading a lonely existence (I'm single as well). Additionally, I'm a couple of years out and I feel like my mathematical abilities have declined, maybe too much for diving straight into research, although the hiring committee obviously didn't feel that way. Career prospects may obviously also be a problem: I have lurked this subreddit enough to understand that an academic career is next to impossible. Why take the first step towards something that is impossible in the first place?  \n\n\nOn the other hand I enjoy teaching, and my personality and interests are more academically inclined than anything else. The research area also seems very suited to my expertise and interests, which is an incredibly lucky situation. Mathematics has been my only consistent interest in my life, and I always envisioned myself being involved with mathematics in some fashion. With that being said, I'm afraid that I just have a romanticised vision of how life as a mathematician would be, while refusing to face up to the reality that it will probably be an incredible hard grind, with the most likely outcome being that I never get anywhere. I guess I would be content with doing the PhD and going back to industry, but it would also feel sort of like a waste.   \n\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is: Did any of you feel the same way as this, and did you regret your choice (whatever that was) later?

We had a brief discussion about any pushback from students watching the episodes as they often have violence, nudity, sex, and language. He said he's never had anyone complain or request an alternative assignment, and the dean even said that she's highly against censorship and that the material in the episodes are no worse than what they're reading in assigned texts. \n\nSo I'm incorporating \"Nosedive\" from Black Mirror into my class this week. It says \"fuck\" like 20 times throughout the episode, one instance of \"pussy,\" and a few scenes with girls in a bra or bikini top. \n\nMy class is 8 females and 1 male. One of the females is so ardently Christian that she wouldn't participate in a discussion about crimes we'd commit in particular circumstances. We were studying \"Thank you, Ma'am\" by Langston Hughes. The male is a strict Muslim who wrote in his first day writing assignment about how difficult it's been living in America where almost no one shares his values. \n\nI'm trying to be the instructor that practices academic freedom under the umbrella of the department's policies. The dean gave the okay and this kind of assignment was even presented on at our community college's conference. So it should be okay to do this, right? \n\nSomething else I'm worried about is showing it in class. The instructor who presented on Black Mirror has his students watch it at home, but I have two issues there: 1) He gives out his login and password for anyone who doesn't have Netflix and 2) He teaches composition and I'm teaching Integrated Reading and Writing, which is essentially the lowest of the low remediation class. I'm honestly not sure all of my students have a device that can access Netflix at home. \n\nI've read a few posts around the Internet from instructors who have shown it (and other Black Mirror episodes) in class. \n\nSorry for the long post, but I'm starting to question if this is the right idea.

But if the worst comes to the worst I could submit without her approval. \n\nThank you for your kind words so far, I feel much better although the panic is still bubbling below the surface. \n\nAnother 'should I quit post'... \n\nI'm in my 4th year of a PhD in Creative Writing in the UK. I took it because I thought it would be a good way to 'follow my passion' but continue to build a career track; I was naive.\n\nI was fully funded for 3 years, then my stipend ran out so I transferred to part time status and have been working full time as an administrative assistant in a local firm. Luckily I'm not in debt because my fees were still funded. There's no reason for it to have taken this long. I could have finished last year and I don't have a good excuse for not doing so except I was so depressed.\n\nThe PhD requires a novel with a 20k theoretical thesis that is thematically linked. I've finished the novel but my research thesis is terrible. With 4 weeks left, my supervisor doesn't think I can finish it on time to the required standard and she is probably right. I have written only 11k and it's like reading an undergraduate dissertation. \n\nThe only reason I haven't quit already is because I don't want to let her down. I don't want to work in academia any more and even if I did there are few jobs. I'm really depressed with how badly I suck at this and how much time I've wasted on a useless degree. I cry all the time and I don't know how I can go on.\n\nI wanted to quit 2 years ago but after talking with my supervisor agreed to stay on. She had a lot of confidence in me and I've just let her down over and over. \n\nSince I have my job in administration, I could quit the PhD and apart from the time I've spent here, I would be okay. My job doesn't pay that well but it's more money than my stipend was and I really enjoy doing it. But I am my supervisor's first PhD student ever and I don't want to make her look bad. However she has lost patience with me and I think would rather terminate me at this point! All my problems are my own because I didn't communicate well with her. I didn't even tell her when my grandmother died which is what started this whole tailspin. \n\nNow my options are to apply for an extension, hope for major corrections, or quit. I flip between these options constantly. The toll this has taken on my mental health has been big and sometimes I worry I'm not safe. My self esteem is on the floor. I am in the university counselling which has been helping. \n\nWhat makes this worse is the feeling that it's not even a respectable degree..  while my colleagues in STEM are doing useful stuff I've achieved nothing much. I was a great student in undergraduate and during my MA, I wish I had stuck to proper research instead of trying to follow my dreams or whatever.\n\nI think I have to scrape through to the end and I'll make it through somehow. \n\nHave you ever heard of anyone being terminated from the programme so close to the end? \n\n\n\n",

I've got several papers and 2 reviews lined up - and while several of the journals I'm submitting to are blind peer reviewed, some aren't, and I'm pretty sure all of them need my bio/CV. \n\nShort summary of my education: got an Honors scholarship to a school of decent repute in Texas, developed a decent CV into my first semester of sophomore year (4 officer positions, research position, admin of youth wing of an international org, 4.0, staff writer for 2 nonprofits, published in poetry journals, volunteered at hospitals/Red Cross). Dropped out to take care of a loved one cuz no one else was able to. \n\nIs there anything I can do to downplay my obvious lack of higher education? I believe my works are of high quality and reflect a lot of learning outside of school. While I get they would want someone familiar with the literature submitting a literature review, for example, maybe I can get away with an unorthodox bio if the review/relevant article is actually decent (and I believe all of them are - at least I hope they are!). \n\nquick follow-up - some of the calls for papers only say to send an abstract. I don't want to assume that they want a bio as well and send them extraneous info, but I also don't want to sound like the novice I am and ask the editor a potentially obvious question - and I honestly can't discern the answer to my satisfaction from the web. Should I send a bio when they only ask for an abstract? If you want examples of the calls let me know - I wouldn't mind sending a writing sample (of course I won't use any approximation of my final submission). \n\nThanks for your time! ",

That coupled with bad breakup and toxic friends too much pot smoking and i did fuckall.\n\nCame back home mid June to stay clean and get therapy. I'm severely distressed according to the her. I have to start from scratch, and finish by July. I'll be back in another week and have to cope with being productive again.\n\n Today got a mail from supervisor after a month of radio silence asking for progress. Hes not really been around to help me much either, which is why ive had trouble planning, but I'm too guilty to tell him I've not done anything. I don't know if I should tell him about this emotional breakdown.\n\nI really don't know if I'm being unrealistic by hoping I can pull this off by the end of the month. I feel like I've chosen a really complicated topic and I get so lost trying to make a plan to structure it each time. Either I read and do too much research and lose track of a structure to contain it. Or I get too lost in the structure and can't seem to even begin to figure out where to do research for it. And if I do make a plan to somehow fit it all in, I realise it's not feasible and panic and don't work at all.\n\nSo that's it. I'm trying to be focused and get done as much as I can but I lost and stupid. I really wanted this to be a pleasurable experience and I don't know how to turn this around.",

(there's the possibility of downgrading my diploma).\n\nI've worked in the first 2-3 years of my doctorate on the very wide domain of therapeutic efficacy, common factors of efficacity in the differents clinical approachs, and therapists' development. It was a very interesting subject, but as I was always looking for a clear explicit thesis project, I couldn't find anything that was already done or was a false path. I really needed some guidance from my thesis supervisor, who is THE researcher on the subject in my region, but had not much more than general feedback.For a couple of reasons, stress and failure being some of them (an injury being one of the others), I was to take a year off, and realised I HAD to change thesis supervisor if I wish to come back. I also tasted what it was like to have a real field-related insight on a thesis subject, and decided to switch from my first thesis subject to working on some factors related to social assistance.\n\nSo now, I'm working on finding my thesis proposal related to a new law passed in my province and is affecting first demanders of social assistance who have non-diagnosis psychological distress. It is actuality-related, I find the field clear and easy to navigate into, and I view some very clear and explicit thesis proposal I can make.But. It's isn't as fascinating as my first subject was. It is easy. I view the next steps as WAY, WAY easier than with my precedent subject. But I'm always wondering if the «boringness» of my new field of interest could become an obstacle as bothersome as the research saturation of my first subject.\n\nSo, I'm wondering what is your opinion and/or experience on that question : what is a better predictor of a thesis going as nicely as it can be : a very fascinating but complex and saturated field, or a pragmatic, simple, clear, targeted but grey-ish field?",

I knew it wasn't, of course, but I'd never had this positivity before from a book, and I was (and am) extremely confident in the work itself. Unfortunately, the reviews have just come in and have been unusually harsh - I strongly disagree with a lot of what the reviews say, and there's a real sense of \"older academics criticising younger scholars\", but as a result the press has now declined the book. This is a real problem as I'm about to go on the job hunt, and having that contract on my CV was a vital part of what I was going to pitch.\n\nI'm going to be submitting it to a new press in the next week or so once I've adjusted it to reflect the useful comments from these reviewers, but once I do so I was thinking about putting it as \"Under Review\" in the books section of my CV. I do put Under Review for journal papers, but I have lots of journal papers published, and lots in top-tier journals, so it looks reasonable to me that when I do that I can give some impression of my most recent research to the reader, and it's realistic to show \"Under Review at \\[Top Journal\\]\" on my CV because I've proven I can and do publish in those. \n\nBy contrast, I have one book out, with a mid-tier press, and this one I'm pitching at top-tier presses only. What do we think about putting \"Under Review\" in this context? And if \"yes\", would you name the press I've sent it to on the CV, or not? If relevant, I'm in a social science field, working at a research university, and applying for jobs at research universities in the US, in Canada, and in Europe. Thanks everyone!",

So He found the mail address of my chairman online and mailed him and the man I worked with for sometime without telling me or consulting me. He can't fix my life problems like that. If he just becomes less of a sources of anxiety for me it will benefit me greatly rather than going around contacting outsiders to do one thing or another.\n\nI am soooo angry and embarrassed.

I know there's a bit of networking I'd have to do so I'm mostly asking in this aspect.\n\nNow suppose I wanted to go straight into a PhD after my bachelor's, what kinds of things would I need to know in order to start making this come together? Aren't there things I should know that are more PhD specific?\n\nAlso, how would I reach out to my potential desired out-of-state school (Carnegie) if I wanted to pursue something with them (whether it be a Master's or PhD)?\n\nAny suggestions and personal experiences are welcome, and if there's any details you might need I'd be happy to share.

Yet, I'd like to see your opinion on the following. \n\nBack in 2015 I got a postdoc position in a biology lab what is considered an elite institute/lab; the contract was for 42000 annual salary, which was around the NIH minimum at the time, so I thought not great but fair enough. \n\nSoon after, I got some fellowship, so my pay got independent of my PI. However, my fellowship expired and so I am back to salary. My first paycheck came the other day, and to my surprise it was 48000/year, which seems to be below the NIH minimum given my years of experience (now I am in year 4 of postdoc), and just above the institute minimum that is 47500. I looked up the numbers here [LINK](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-175.html) ; hope I did not misunderstand. It is very confusing to me, because I have been told directly many times by my boss how much I am valued (and indeed I am the only person in the lab with a skill set required for everyone's projects data analysis, so I essentially work on everyone's projects, also mentor students, etc.), so I was hoping that this would be reflected once I get back to salary. \n\nIs that situation normal? Can I question my salary and how could I do that without making in awkward? Maybe in some areas in the US, this 48k sounds good, but I am in one of the most expensive cities, half of my after tax income goes to rent (of a room!), so every little helps. I have no idea what other postdocs get, as it is not public information. \n\nTL;DR As a life sciences postdoc with 3-4 years of experience, I am getting paid less than the NIH minimum, and almost the same as the institute minimum.
