        "text": "When I was a boy, I wasn't into baseball or football, but airplanes. In those days we didn't have the internet, and as a hobby, I'd read about planes in every article or magazine I could get my hands on. Not into the sports, I collected pictures of airplanes, cut them out and pasted them in a binder, writing down names and information on each as I went along, along the same lines as collecting cards. War planes were especially interesting to me. Long forgotten now, but used to know everything a boy could find out about P-51s, B-29s, Sopwith Camels, SR-71s, etc, that kind of stuff.\n\nSo anyway, the years passed and life goes on. My collection of airplane pictures gets tossed out after I left home, just as so many lament the baseball cards they had that mom threw out. Same deal. \n\nSo the glitch … it's the one plane I absolutely remember, but have since discovered has never really existed. It was the B-27 bomber of WWII. A four engine US heavy bomber that was flown in Europe, it was a late war upgrade of the B-17 that was used at the start of American involvement. It was built by Boeing and looked exactly like one would expect it to look in appearance. Something to the effect of a design that was sleeker and more modern than the B-17 and a bit smaller, and less next generation than the B-29.\n\nThough the B-27 is in my head … I had it … I can picture it … I know for certain it did exist, yet no reference to it can be found in the real world today. And no, I'm not mistaking it for a B-24, B-25, or B-26 … I know all those, as well as others. Believe me, I've searched, but to no avail, yet the memory remains. Is this a glitch … who knows, maybe just a false memory … maybe I switched universes … or maybe it was just an old Dr. Who episode … but to me, the Boeing B-27 was and remains, real.\n",

        "text": "Hello, LTL-FTP and all that jazz.\n\nAfter reading for a couple of days now, I was reminded of a glitch that happened a couple of months ago, around October or 2015.\n\nTo start, let me say I own and drive 2 cars on a regular basis, an old 2 seat convertible (1987 Alfa Romeo Spider for those whom car) and a newer sedan (2001 Jaguar XJ8). When I'm not driving anyone around, I always take my Alfa.\n\nWell, on to the story.\n\nI'm going to visit a friend of mine that lives about 45 minutes away. It's a nice day, so I take the top off of my Alfa and start the drive.\n\nIt's the same route I always take, so I don't remember too much of the ride, I don't think anything note worth happened.\n\nThe note worthy event was when I got to my friends house, and began to close the sun roof of my 4 door.\n\nWhen I was watching it close, I felt something wasn't right, and when I realized I was in the other car, my mind just went blank.\n\nI tried telling my friend about what happened, and she just thought I was crazy, that I hadn't slept enough the night before and zoned out when grabbing my keys. I know this isn't what happened because I regularly sleep from 9:30 PM until 4:30 AM, and this day wasn't anything out of the normal. I very rarely drink, and d absolutely no drugs, I'm not on any medication, and I can not think of any reason this could have happened.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if you think I'm crazy, I know I would, but I just thought I could share this story and get some opinions on what may have happened.\n\nEDIT: When I got home later that day, the top was still on the Alfa, as if it never came off in the first place.",

        "text": "So, I came home one Friday from a friends house sort of dehydrated when I was about 14. I decided to take 2 advil, get a big glass of water, and a bowl of ice cream. I went downstairs to my tv and turned on the 1st episode of the 1st season of a show on Netflix. It was ~8:15pm when the show started. I blinked.\nI opened my eyes to find myself under the covers of my bed in my room, upstairs and a fair distance from the couch. I checked the clock. 11:15am. I sat there in confusion for a second, and then chalked it up to forgetting I went to bed. It happens sometimes. I looked down at what I was wearing. A different shirt. Not a pajama shirt like I would have put on, but a button down flanel. Odd. I pulled back the sheets to see my naked ass lower half revealed to the brisk air. Again, odd. Maybe someone put me to bed but switched my shirt and took my pants and underwear off wait what? Nah nah nah.\nConfused, I put some pants on. I went downstairs, looking for my parents and my dog. They were nowhere to be found. I went outside where you can find children playing just about any time of the day. None. I was freaking out by this point. I thought some how aliens had abducted everyone but left me half naked, on my own. I went to the tv to check the last place I was. Netflix was on, and I noticed every episode of the 1 season had been watched. For those of you unfamiliar with Nwtflix, after a few episodes it asks you if you're still watching and you have to actively select the option to continue watching. So, some how I had done that. Also, the ice cream and water were both empty. Not melted or put away. Empty. Eaten and drunk. \nI grabbed the Xbox controller and saw that I had some friends on online. Good. I wasn't the only person left on earth. I joined their chat party to tell them what was going on with me.\n\"Yo, you guys wouldn't believe the day I'm having.\"\n\"Whoa, you ok, man? You were being weird last night.\"\nUh oh. I didn't talk to them last night. At least I don't remember it.\n\"What did I do,\" I asked.\n\"You joined our party and started speaking in tongues or some shit. It was hella weird.\"\nI left the party. Wtf had happened last night? Just then my parents walked in the door with my dog. Whew. Things were starting to settle. I told my mom about what was going on. She dismissed it with \"Oh, you were just tired.\" I guess. My dad told me to go mow the lawn. I went back up to my room to change into something I could mow in, and that's when I finally found the shorts I had been wearing the night before. I picked them up and immediately noticed the significant weight of these daaark brown, previously light khaki, cargo shorts. That's when the smell hit me. A stronger stench of piss than the county jail drunk tank smacked me in the face, bringing back the only memory I have of the night before. I was standing in front of my bed, looking down and peeing my pants, thinking to myself \"I should stop this.\"\nThat's it. That's all I know about the 15 hour gap. And no, I never found the shirt I had been wearing.\nTL;DR: Blinked at 8:15pm and woke up in my bed at 11:15am, naked, confused, alone, and with some stank ass pants.",

        "text": "A few years ago, on Christmas, I was rooting through my stocking and found a pair of earrings. They were green clay models of upright sitting cats, attached to an arched wire at the top so they would hang from my ears. The cats were painted to have faces and red collars. I thanked my parents and held up the earrings to show them what I was referring to, but my mom and dad both denied putting them there. My father joked that Santa must have gotten them for me, but I was twelve at the time and we all knew I didn't believe anymore, so I know that wasn't his way of saying he bought them. It's been four years since then, and we still don't know where the earrings came from. I doubt they were a previously undiscovered gift, because I hadn't even had pierced ears before that year - my piercing and my first pair of earrings had been a present for my twelfth birthday. There is no reason the earrings would have been given to me before then, at least, not in a Christmas stocking. I can't even find the earrings on any shopping websites, and frankly it's starting to freak me out a little bit. Any thoughts?",

I got it about 8 years ago at a flea market. My roommates at the time would borrow it occasionally but would always put it back on the same hook on my jewelry post because they know how particular I am about my stuff being promptly returned to its proper place. Anyway, flash forward about two years, and I am packing my things to move states. I notice the necklace missing but I hadn't packed it yet. I assumed my roommates took it, but they both denied it profusely. After packing up the whole house, I still hadn't found the necklace, but there was nothing I could do so I moved and forgot about it over the years... until last year.\n\nLast year I was on a family vacation in Italy, and after a few days my suitcase was looking messy so I decided to unpack and repack it. Right as I am taking the last piece of clothing out of the suitcase, I notice something weird at the bottom. There is the necklace I had lost years ago, laying perfectly in the bottom of my suitcase, as if someone had placed it there intentionally. Now, I know the obvious explanation would be that it had gotten stuck somewhere in my suitcase when I had moved years before or something, but the only problem with this explanation is that I had just purchased this suitcase, brand new, right before my trip to Italy. There was literally no way it could have been there, and I still to this day have no idea how it got there, years later, halfway across the world. I'm just glad I got it back I suppose?\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if this was the right category for this, but it really freaked me out so I thought I would share. :)",

But I appreciate any and all sincere responses and feedback!\n\n----------\n\nHere is my story --\n\nThe night before last, I went to bed at 11:44 PM. I know this because I checked the clock when I laid down. I fell asleep pretty quickly. Some time later, I was awoken by a loud banging sound. Scared the shit out of me! It was dark and I grabbed my phone to check what time it was. My phone said 12:49 AM. I was surprised it had just been over an hour as it felt like I had been asleep longer than that. No bother of course, but I decided to grab the tablet on the nightstand and turn on some music to fall back asleep to (that banging noise really got my heart racing!)\n\nAgain, some time later I awoke to a banging sound. The same sound (or at least, rather close to it). Again, it scared the shit out of me! This time, however, there was a glowing light coming from under my bed, between my bed and nightstand. It was the tablet. It had somehow fallen off the nightstand and landed, face up, under my bed. I'm assuming that was the banging noise. The music was still playing.\n\nI reached down and grabbed the tablet (was a little scared some monster would get me, but no such monster was there). The music had been playing about 25 minutes. I knew this because it was a YouTube video. I checked the time on the tablet -- 12:22 AM.\n\n12:22 AM??? I turned the song on at 12:49 AM.. I checked my phone thinking my tablet might be set to the wrong time zone. My phone also read 12:22 AM.\n\n------\n\nHere is my argument to \"being tired\" or \"dreaming\" --\n\nIt is well known telling time in dreams is practically, if not completely, impossible. Time telling -- or lack thereof -- is one of the significant indications you are dreaming. When learning to lucid dream, or in practicing lucid dreaming, we are taught to look for a clock or attempt to tell them time as a for-sure sign you are in a dream because you can't tell time in a dream! The clocks will be manipulated or distorted, or the numbers won't make sense (like they will show impossible times \"32:69\") or they will constantly be changing (switching between \"10:32\" and \"7:45\" as you are reading the numbers).\n\nThe fact that I was able to look at the time, both instances, clearly determine what time it was and have a lucid, cognitive thought concerning the actual time, tells me I was not dreaming.\n\n--------\n\nSo... Possible explanations?? Is there anything with the specific times I woke up and/or went to bed?",

It's worth mentioning that I hadn't opened any Office 2013 applications since installing Windows 10. \n\nAs I was waiting for the computer to finish booting up I was looking at the desktop image, it was something I put together with our company logo on it etc... and thought to myself \"I should email that image to myself and so I can put it on my new work laptop\". Just a thought.\n\n\nOnce the computer had finished booting up I opened Outlook, and a 'configuring Office 2013' window popped up and just hung there for a while. As it was just hanging there I thought \"this looks like it's going to take a while, I'll give it 10 minutes\" and left the room to go see my wife and daughter. I came back into the room 10 minutes or so later and the screen was still hanging there. So I sat and waited. As I did, my phone alerted me that I had a new email. It was an email from myself, to myself with the attached desktop image I was thinking about.\n\n\nThere was no way I actually physically did this. I'm not mental, I remember having the thought but I know for sure 100% I didn't act upon it. Fact is I couldn't have! \n\n\n* a) The **only** place with the image was the hanging laptop.\n* b) I was stone cold sober, no memory loss, mentally fine, no illness\n* c) **Nobody** but me has access to my email\n* d) My Outlook was frozen so I couldn't even send the mail if I wanted to\n\n\nI would love to hear any thoughts, theories or similar stories. I know it may not appear as spooky as some other stories here, but it has me completely baffled.",

I was sitting on the couch in the living room and had a full view of the outside through two huge windows. \n\nMy dad was asleep on the other side of the couch, my brothers were asleep in their room, and my stepmom was asleep in her room.\n\nI was playing a game on my dsi, minding my own business, when I notice a low buzzing noise. I paid it no mind until it started getting louder and closer. As it did, I noticed it sounded less like a buzz and more like a helicopter. I expected it to just pass as normal. But it didn't. It got closer and louder until it sounded like it was right on top of my house. It got so loud that I had to cover my ears. I started to panic at this point. I noticed that the trees and grass outside weren't moving. They should have been blowing like crazy if there was a helicopter on top of the house. After a few minutes, it faded away.\n\nI wondered why the noise hadn't woke my family up. A few hours later, two of my brothers woke up. I asked them if they had heard the noise, or even if they had a dream about a helicopter or something, but they said they hadn't. My dad, stepmom, and my other brother all said the same thing.\n\nI couldn't have imagined or dreamed it. It felt way too real, and I can still remember it like it happened yesterday. \n\nWhat was it?",

        "text": "So I wrote about this a couple of days after it happened happened, but never got around to posting it. It happened January 18th. Here it is:\n\n\nI was sitting in the dining room at the table, working on an art piece for my portfolio. I had been talking to a few people for a few hours on snapchat, mostly focusing on my work though. Time passed and I realized it was probably 10:08 (my favorite number is 108, and I have a joke about it with my friend. Whenever it's 1:08, 11:08,etc, I send her a snapchat with that timestamp). I looked at my phone and saw that I had just missed it, and it was 10:14. So I get up and go to the kitchen to get a snack and I look at the official kitchen clock, again, it says 10:14. As I pass the microwave it says the same on the analog display. So I get my snack and go back to drawing for a couple of hours. I had been drawing for a while because I had finished a nice charcoal piece and was now working on a watercolour. At some point I think to myself, \"wow it's probably past midnight, I'm gonna be miserable waking up at 5am, I should go to bed\" and start putting my stuff away. I go into the bathroom to brush my teeth, pull out my phone quickly to check the time, and it says 10:14. Wait....what??? So I look at the bathroom clock. 10:14. At that moment I got really dizzy (probably due to surprise) and then checked the kitchen clock again.  Yeah, 10:14.\n\nWhen I realized what had happened (or rather, didn't), I was really freaked out so I went downstairs asking my parents what they were doing for the past couple of hours. They had just been organizing part of the exercise room and we're going to go to bed in 15 minutes. I've told a couple of people about this but I'm not sure if they believe me. What do you think?",

        "text": "This happened last year in January. Went to bed, fell asleep as normal, but had an extremely vivid and realistic dream. In the dream I was laying in my bed facing the near wall, on which there's a big window about 4 feet away near my feet. In the dream I had just woken up and was still in bed, and the sun was shining brightly in the position it'd be in if it were around 9-10am, if I had slept in. Anyway, I reached up to shield my eyes from the blinding light, when I saw a blue orb like object appear between the bed and the wall. It rose up to the height of my face, where it stopped and started glowing brighter and getting larger. I understood immediately that it was my grandfather, who I had never actually met before, and had only briefly talked to on the phone once a week. At the time I was not fluent in russian and just learning, and as he was born in Russia and never learned English, conversation was sometimes difficult. However, I knew it was him and I felt incredibly warm and fuzzy inside. Then, I felt him speaking to me quickly. Not in words, but rather putting ideas in my head. He said \"Goodbye, I love you with all my heart and I want you to know that things may not make sense. Good luck, take care of your father for me.\" Then the dream seemed to freeze and I looked around. Above the bookcase next to my bed was a calendar. Not one that I owned. It was open to March and the day 14 was circled in red and on it was written \"going away party\".....as soon as I read it the dream ended. \n\nThat year on March 14th my father got a call from my grandmother saying that my grandpa had died. His death was under weird circumstances.... they brought him to the emergency room when he was having trouble breathing, wouldn't let my grandmother see him, then announced to her that he was dead. They first said he had a heart attack, then claimed he had a seizure. When she described how he looked, she said that he was covered in bruises as if he had been resisting doctors, which was really strange because he was so weak he could not feed himself. \n\n\nSo....that is my glitch in the matrix. Or maybe my predicting the future.",

        "text": "I used to be best friends with another boy named Michael who went to my school. Way back in first or second grade he showed me this cool magic trick where you think really hard of the number 1, 2, or 3. Then he would take your hand (I think either hand would work) and he would pinch apart the skin on the palm. Michael would squint and look really close until he found something. Then he would say the exact number that I was thinking of. He was rarely wrong. I thought his magic trick was so amazing that I begged him to show me how. Michael explained that when you thought of a number really hard, it would show up in white under your skin. He tried to show me where the number was, but I could never see it. \n\nAfter a few weeks of doing the magic trick, I decided to trip him up. He asked me to think of a number 1-3, as usual, but instead I thought really hard about the number 7. He looked at my hand and pinched the skin out to look and made a strange face. He asked me, confused, if I thought of the number 7. Of course, he was right, and I was in awe. This proves that he wasn't just a really good guesser. I tried for hours to see the numbers, too. I never could. He stopped doing it after a while and I forgot about it. \n\nI recently thought back to our times together and I remembered the magic trick. I thought about how cool it was and began to wonder how he did it. Then I realized how fucking impossible it all is. I know it wasn't a dream, there were too many vivid memories of him reading my palm for numbers. I have no way to explain how he was able to do this. ",

Her husband was getting ready to go out and meet with friends, but before he left he asked my sister to call his phone because he couldn't find it. That in and of itself was weird because he is a super type A everything in its place kind of person. \n\nAll three of us searched high and low all throughout the house and called it repeatedly- he says he had the ringer on loud- but it was nowhere to be found. He was running late so he just left without it and said he would text from a friends phone when he got there. \n\nShe and I decided to make cookies so both of us were pacing around the kitchen drinking wine talking and baking. After about an hour we were sitting at their breakfast bar talking when all of a sudden something catches my sisters eye and she looks down. \"Oh my god a_mcclung22... It's the phone.\" \n\nI kid you not it was smack in the middle of the floor in the kitchen. One of the many spaces we had turned upside down looking for the phone. It's not a huge kitchen so with three of us running around searching one of us was bound to see it  or at least kick it. My sister and I were in there for an hour cooking. There's no possible way we wouldn't have seen it. Oh and the ringer was indeed on loud. So, somehow it reappeared in the center of the room on full volume and none of us saw it or heard it when we called it. My brother in law is convinced he has a portal in his pocket. ",

        "text": "I browse this subreddit every once in a while to creep myself out and/or have my mind blown. Finally dug into the memory bank for something I might have to offer and I finally remembered a glitch that I actually think about pretty often considering it happened 15-16 years ago. \n\nI was in the fifth grade and we had a class of about 20. Mrs. Davis was a piece of work as it was. Davis had no discernible motivation for teaching as she blatantly hated kids, and lord knows they're not paid enough, but we were 10 so we thought her nasty outbursts were hilarious. I remember one rainy day during an indoor recess she screamed \"SHUT THE FUCK UP\" and we all froze. As we giggled she clenched her fists and stormed out in a huff. \n\nAnyhoo, to the glitch. So, we were in the middle of a history lesson and Davis was facing the chalkboard writing. I had a snack under my desk  that I was trying to silently free from its crinkle paper, but she busted me and snatched my Chex Mix. Everyone laughed and she was visibly pissed. A few kids in class were giggling and talking and she spun around to tell them off, but she stopped as she was about to open her mouth and turned back towards the board. She began teaching the lesson again, but it wasn't her voice. It sounded digital and static, hiccuping on syllables. She was also getting stuck on certain words like she was 'glitching' repeating them over and over. Mind you, we can't see her face. She's faced towards the chalkboard with her back to the classroom.\n\nThis went on for about 15-20 seconds while we all looked at each other in bewilderment. Being 10, we thought she must've been joking. Again, the classroom erupted in giggles and she turned on her heel and after a long pause yelled \"WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT!?\" The laughter stopped and I remember thinking 'what just happened?' Class resumed normally after that and for the rest of the school year. She never came down with an illness or had a true stroke which is one of the only explanations I could come up with thinking about it over the years.\n\nAnything similar ever happen to you guys?\n\n",

I was probably around 8 or 9, somewhere in that range, and I was playing with my neighbour in my basement. My mom was on the top floor in her bathroom, and my sister, around 13 or 14, was doing homework on the main floor.\n\nWhile my friend and I were playing, we heard a loud female voice yell \"Daniel, come here!\" From somewhere above the basement. It wasn't quite a yell, but loud enough we both heard it and immediately walked upstairs. We looked for my mom, who was still in her bathroom, and she had no idea what we were talking about. We asked my sister and she said she heard it, but thought it was my mom.\n\nI'm not a big believer in anything paranormal, but this has still confused me since that day. My mom denied having said anything, and my sister still agrees that she heard someone. Neither of them would hold a joke this long, especially since they're both also creeped out by it if it's brought up. It wasn't a neighbour, since the voice was clearly in the house, and it also said my name. I have no idea what happened, and just thought I'd post it.",

        "text": "Except for one other incident a while ago, I've never really had a \"glitch in the matrix\" type of event in my life until today, and I still have no explanation.\n\nLast week my family and I went skiing for the weekend. We're a family of skiers, so we all have a season pass and our own equipment. I'm in college though, so I have to remember to bring all my ski stuff back and forth from school. Last weekend I realized I had forgotten my ski pass in my dorm, so first thing I did saturday morning was go over to the lodge to see if they could deactivate my old one and get me a new one so I would be able to ski. After some back and forth with the woman at the counter we compromised on a 7-Day College Pass, so I would be able to ski that weekend. It wasn't really the best situation because I'm not going to be back at school for another few weeks, so I would need to go back every weekend I'm skiing to get a new pass as they expire, but I took the offer. She printed out the new card, punched a hole in it for the lanyard, and I went off skiing for the weekend.\n\nThe mountain has a new pass-scanner that can scan your pass through clothing, so I shoved the new pass in my snow pants' pocket. After the weekend was over I left it in there, since it wouldn't be going anywhere and I was going to be skiing this weekend as well.\n\nThis morning I woke up to go ski, got all ready to go out, put on my snow pants, extra layers, grabbed my pass from off my dresser, --- but then I stopped. Why was it on my dresser? I checked my pocket, and my pass was in there as well. Somehow I now have two identical 7-Day College Passes. I have absolutely no clue where the other one came from and which is the original. In case you're curious, this couldn't be an old pass, I've never had a 7-Day College Pass, it's always been a season pass. Also, it's the same serial number and same year printed on both passes, each on separate black lanyards. I just shoved them both in my pocket, but I couldn't be more stumped as to where they came from. Gave me a weird feeling all day.\n\ntldr; I now have two of something I only ever got one of\n\nBonus:  The other glitch in the matrix I had was 4 or 5 years ago watching a friend play Minecraft. She was walking through her underground mining tunnel and I told her (half as a joke, half I can't explain but I just got a feeling) that she should stop and dig at a spot I pointed out to her right. She knocked out a few blocks, said \"haha there's nothing there\" and was about to leave when I told her to go a bit deeper. I'm not sure what compelled me, either just this feeling that I knew I was right in telling her to dig, but still playing it off as joking. She went one block deeper and hit 8 diamond. She demanded to know how I knew, but I had no way to explain. One of the weirdest things I've experienced",

And I did. I took a long, sudden breath and I was fine.  \nOnly problem being: My head was completely submerged and I should have sucked water, instead it was as if there was a pocket of air underwater. Needless to say nobody believed me and I thought maybe my head was just sticking out of the water and I didn't notice. Anyway, I never played that stupid game again.  \n\n**2^nd time:**  \nA few years later I was on vacation and I was playing with waves.  \nMy mother told me to be careful because they were dangerous, but the 16 y.o. me had none of it, so I went full on playing with waves.  \nSuddenly a really big wave came and caught me off guard, and dragged me underwater. I couldn't breathe and as soon as I tried to get up to get some air another wave immediately dragged me down again.  \nI was scared as fuck, I really thought I was going to die or something, given the fact that I was deep underwater.  \nI was desperate for air and that reflex came again and deep underwater I just caught the deepest breath and I actually breathed, not a single drop of water in my lungs.  \n\nThis time there was no doubt, but still nobody believed me.  \n\nTo this day I don't know what the fuck happened in both occasions and I was wondering if there is a scientific explanation for what I experienced.  \n\nAnyway, I'm staying the hell out of water.  \n",

I remember getting up writing the time and date down on my table which was across the room.I know this wasn't a dream because I felt the cold air and the pen and paper were on the table but no writing on it. I was in the same spot I left it in my dream. I woke up to me sleeping on my bed and went to go look for the paper and I couldn't find it. I turned my room inside out looking for it and I didn't' find it. I don't know if this was just in my dreams, but it felt so real.

I did this a few times. Always one toy at a time and I would put it back in the box after the \"trick\" was done. They were a bit younger than me so they obviously believed me and were stoked and wanted me to do it again. So I told them to close their eyes and I took a toy giraffe out of the box but put it back in and looked away.

        "text": "First time poster, recently found this subreddit and figured I should share the two reality fuck-ups I remember.\nFirst was while I was at work. I used to be a greeter in a home improvement type store, so every single person who enters the store has to pass by me. It's fairly quiet, and I see a lady come in on my right and grab one of the flatbed trollies, used for the really heavy stuff. I turn to look behind me for a second (throwing off another 'good morning' to someone entering the store), turn back around and this exact same woman is queuing up for the checkout with two airconditioners on her trolley.\nThe glitch is; it was not physically possible for her to have GOTTEN those aircons. The store was part of a big chain and was a bigass store (for any aussies: it was a bunnings to make you understand how big they are). We stored our aircons on the back isle of the store, which is a good walk while lugging a massive trolley. There is nowhere she could have stashed these aircons; the front displays were small shit like fancy deck chairs and two honking aircon units a) could not have hidden behind them and b) could not have been stored, because I would have seen it and let someone know to move them back to where they belonged.\nIt was the exact same women, and it freaked me out and confused the hell out of me for the rest of the day. Like, even if she had full on SPRINTED to the back to grab these units she wouldn't have been able to get there, grab them, and get into the queue in the split second it took me to say 'hi' to the person behind me then turn back around. No idea wtf happened there, and to be glad I was happy to see her go even if she seemed perfectly nice.\n\nSecond one was at home and was just a really fucking weird noise. I was out in the chicken coop, just watching the chooks dick around, when this massive blaring noise started up out of nowhere. Imagine a train horn, but lower and louder and longer and also nothing like a train horn. Best I could think would be what those 'strange sound' videos sound like. It went on for a good two-three minutes, rising and falling in volume slightly, but it most definitely was not a siren. (My town has one for the local firestation, and it does not sound anything like what I heard!)\nI tried to think of what it could be; way too loud and constant for a truck, didnt sound a thing like the siren, and we're too far away to hear the siren, and it didn't sound a single thing like the mining equipment they use in the strip mine a good way from us. (which it also couldn't have been, since I've literally never heard that mine from my house and the mine would be faint at best, while this was very clear and loud).\nAfter it finished I just kinda went 'fuck that' and just walked back inside. I figured if it was aliens they would have to be happy with chickens.",

As soon as it happened, it seemed like  time itsself, or at least everything else around me seemed to slow down to about one tenth of normal speed. I remember distinctly turning around and while i seemed to go as normal, I noticed out my bedroom window a bird was flying past to land in the tree right outside, and i could count the bird's wing flaps as it slowly passed by and could see it trying to adjust its body to land on this branch. As soon as i noticed it though and saw the bird, it felt like someone uncorked the room and suddenly everything sped up and was back to normal and the pressure was gone. I told my parents who said i was just being silly or not paying attention to what was going on, but over the next two years three other times i can remember this happenining. It happened twice in my bedroom, once in the living room while watching tv, and then again once while outside playing in the yard. It then stopped as suddenly as it began. I'm 33 years old now, and still can't identify what was going on in those moments or what happened exactly.",

        "text": "I spent the weekend at my cousin's house one time and came across a terrifyingly large bee? It could be a false memory, but I can't think of any other ones I've ever had.\n\nSo, I'm alone, outside, they live not quite in the country but far enough away to have a cornfield behind the house. I am pretty bored after awhile. I swam in a blow up pool, ventured as far into the backyard/cornfield as I could without scaring myself. \n\nI've just left the cornfield when I turn around and check out (hey, how big was it anyway??) and this giant monster of a bee basically catapults from out of it and flies towards me. It's definitely bigger than me, and I'm probably about 5' tall at the time. It had a bumble-bee type body. I fucking bolt. I'm out of there so fast. I hear this ridiculous buzzing so loud and I fear for my life, but eventually make my way around the corner of the house and through a sliding door. \n\nIt never hits the glass and I retreat at full-speed to underneath my cousin's bed. Underneath were orange ladybugs and I remember thinking that I don't even care how many bugs are under there AS LONG as they weren't giant, like the one I just narrowly escaped from.\n\nIt's the only weird experience that has ever happened to me, and it wasn't brought on by fear of bugs, because of my reaction right afterwards that I clearly remember. It also was not a repeated experience.",

        "text": "I have this account written in a journal. This isn't the only strange thing that's ever happened to me. My house is known to have a weird presence, my friends and family always note that they don't like being alone in my house, etc. People have seen shadows, heard whispers, had their named called here to no apparent explanation. A friend of my dad's is a n orthodox priest, and he blesses my house ever 6 months. He's noted privately to my dad that our basement has an uneasy presence and that we should be careful in remembering to have the house blessed regularly. \n\nAnyway, this one summer day I was alone upstairs. My dad was downstairs, working in his office. I was bored, walking around and not wanting to go outside because it was too hot, so I had the AC running. Anyway, I come to the kitchen and sit at the table, which is against a wall, of which on the other side is the staircase to go downstairs. There is a doorway ahead of me that let's me see the hallway, and behind me is an open area to the dining and living rooms. So I sit for about a minute reading a magazine, when I hear my dad come up the stairs. He's wearing scratchy sounding pants, most likely his workout pants, and I can hear he's barefoot. I hear him come up, turn, and go into the hallway. The hallway is dark but I see his distinct outline as he walks down the hallway towards his bedroom. And right as he disappears, I hear a LOUD ship bell (or railroad bell) ring through the room, DING DING DING DING DING. It was so loud I clapped my hands over my ears, and when it stopped my ears were ringing. Startled I immediately ran to my dad's bedroom, looking for him. He's not there. I check every room upstairs, he's in none of them. I go downstairs, and he's in his office at his desk, working. I ask him if he heard the noise. What noise? Ok, nevermind. Was he upstairs? No. Was he upstairs in the past 10 minutes? No.\n\nSo after that you could say I was definitely freaked out. I have no clue what happened....I'm in rural eastern united states, there were no railroads within 5 miles of me, and I'm certainly not near any shipyards. This one I just can't explain. And it's still my favorite experience.",

When homeroom was starting I walked in to the school, sat down in my seat, opened my hand to put the amethyst in my backpack, and it was gone. How could it be gone? It was in my hand the whole time. I even left my homeroom to retrace my steps to see if I somehow dropped it. I never even felt it leave my hand. I never saw it again. It just...disappeared. It fucked me up for a while.

When the lady handed us two paper bags my mom quickly told me to check the bags if we had all our orders in before we left. I reported to her that the fries, two regular and one large IIRC, were not included.\n\nA bit annoyed, she got the lady's attention again and told her of the mistake. She apologized at not having taken it down, my mom paid the extra money, then she handed us a bag of fries. My mom passed it to me and I set it down somewhere. \n\nOn the ride home my mother complained that this was not the first time this happened, that the service people there must be hard of hearing and that she wasn't returning to that branch again.\n\nBefore we pulled into our driveway, I grabbed the bags to get ready to alight the car, but there were only TWO McDonalds bags. The third bag of fries had gone completely missing, and it wasn't inside one of the other two bags either. We had no fries at all.\n\nWe searched the whole car and it was nowhere to be found. For the life of me neither my mom nor I can remember where I set it down after she handed it to me. She paid extra money for nothing. Even my mom couldn't stop thinking about it.",

        "text": "I don't really know where else to post this, but it seemed very... Glitchy to me. It's still really vivid in my memory. I can't stop thinking of it.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I was sitting in my last lecture of the semester and we were doing professor evaluations so it was dead silent, except for this odd clicking background sound and a sort of static noise/energy you hear and feel when you're in like a computer lab.\n\nAt first, I assumed the sound was an animal in the walls or something (I work in a university building and we had a problem with a raccoon at work a week earlier), but I wasn't sitting near a wall, the entire left side of the room is floor to ceiling windows.I just assumed the static feeling was me being weird. \n\nIt's a smaller lecture, about 30 students in seven rows of seats about 10 desks long. And we all spread evenly throughout the seats.\n\nThe noise continued when our professor started to lecture, and everyone heard it. Our professor pointed it out and asked what was up, so we broke political discussion and started talking about it. \n\nI thought the noise was coming from the front right of the room (I was sitting in the back left), but the kid behind me said he swore it was coming from right in front of us. I heard it evenly in both ears though, which was odd and when I said that, everyone else agreed. My professor thought it was coming from the dead center of the room, and a kid in the center thought it was coming from the back right, girl in the back right thought it was coming from center left, it went on for minutes, all of us saying we thought it was coming from somewhere else despite the sound being even. People would occasionally agree, but they were never from the same section. Obviously the acoustics in the room were meant to reach for lectures, but still weird AF.\n\nIt continued through regular lecture, but it wasn't until 15 minutes into the lecture that I realized what the noise was. I was typing my notes when the tapping momentarily matched my keystrokes, and I recognized the sound immediately. \n\nIt was typing. \n\nAt least three or four keyboards. Only one other girl and I had our computers that day, and she sits in the seat right next to me so I knew it wasn't her. Plus it persisted when neither of us were typing. And I know what that sound is, I work in a newsroom where there are at least three people typing at all times and it sounded the exact same. I knew I was right.\nIt was really odd, and I wasn't paying attention to lecture at all at this point, instead focusing on the tapping. \nSuddenly there were three louder beeps and the sound of a machine or something powering down. \n\nIt just stopped. \n\nYou could tell everyone noticed, we all looked around at each other, the professor stopped talking mid sentence, and the air seemed thinner, less charged if that makes sense. \n\nEveryone was silent for the rest of the class, which was odd since it's usually a very spirited debate class and we were talking about protests, something I know everyone felt rather strong about. \n\nYou could see the tension on everyone's faces as we left the lecture hall a while later, I think everyone sensed it wasn't natural, but no one knew what to think. I still don't, I just know whatever we heard didn't come from that room or that building. ",

I moved out of there when I was about 4, and the only things I can remember from that place are very disturbing, incredibly so that I'm getting tears in my eyes as I'm having flash backs. \n\nI'm going to list examples, but I'll start with some minor occurrences first. \nI had my own room but I enjoyed sleeping with my parents instead, although when it was time to go to bed and the lights were off, I would see faces through the bathroom window (the bathroom was attached to master bedroom) I would also sense scary beings and I would have to bury my face and cover my ears to be able to sleep.\n\nI would have reoccurring dreams, like walls closing in on me and my family members, we would be in a line and I would be the last one. my dad would make it out right before me and when the wall closed on me i would wake up right before dying. I also had dreams about being kidnapped, and some man would slam a meat tenderizer onto my small head and right before I died, I would wake up.\n\nI seemed to have strange hallucinations in the house too, like once I looked outside and I saw a giant red hot air balloon, I was so amazed and I called my mom over to come see it. a second later, it was gone.\n\none night I woke up screaming, covered in bugs. bugs were crawling all over my sister and mother and my mom woke me up and took me to my room, yet bugs were still everywhere. I went to go sleep with my dad on the couch, and the ceiling fan appeared to be a giant crab, so I cried and ran back to my room.\n\none of my dads friends tried living there and he  moved because it was too creepy, and for the finale:\n\nmy mom told me she would wake up and the ceiling fan would be right next to her face and she would blink and it would return to the ceiling where it was supposed to be. she would also have reoccurring dreams about drowning.\n\nAnd one night, she woke up and said she saw the figure of a teenage boy dressed in a jean hat, jean jacket, and Jean pants, float across the room to look into my crib, and then he disappeared.\n\ntl;dr: the first house I ever lived in was haunted, or some other fucked up shit was going on.",

I was about 8 years old at home one night when I got it in my mind that I would try to move something with my mind and that I was going to give it my best try.\n\n  So there I was in my kitchen sitting on a step stool and I decide to try and make my toaster move.  It was about 10 foot away on the counter to my left.  I focused my mind and intently tried with all my energy to make the toaster move.  It wasn't moving so I continued knowing I wanted to give this my best shot.  I continued with this intense focus for what seemed to me for several minutes.  All at once something happened that had never happened before in my life nor after this occasion.  The metal pots and pans poured out of the cabinet to my right.  They came tumbling out of the cabinet as if a force shoved them from the inside out.  \n\nSure anyone could chalk this up as my parents didn't put up the pots and pans properly and they came tumbling out however this would be something that had never before and would never happen again and the one time it did happen was at this specific time. Is this one time occurance a coincidence or was it something more. Was it the will of a child intensely focused who had not yet learned of the boundaries and limitations that society places on a person?  This has been strange story that has stuck with me into adulthood.",
