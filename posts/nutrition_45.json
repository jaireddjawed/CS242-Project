But doing an office job, I keep sticking to my usual drinking habit of only around 2  \nto 2.5 liters per day with 300ml during each working sessions in morning and afternoon and it already causes me the urge to pee quite often and I am afraid drinking up to around 4 liters per day will worsen the problems (I don't want to get up the chair and pee every hours). Anyone with same problems and how you manage your water intake. Is it ok to drink normal during the day and finish the rest (2.5-3 liters) during your workout and eating window in the evening. Or any correlation between peeing and water intake control, like if you pee this much, it is probably indication that your water intake is sufficient and you don't have to overdo it! Any thoughts?",

        "text": "[Here is a list of countries by average daily food energy intake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_food_energy_intake). USA is at 3782 per day, and other Western countries are not far behind.\n\nHow is this even physically possible?\n\nI am trying to do the math and I cannot come up with what people could eat to meet that average. Keep in mind it’s an average, too; some eat even more! \n\nFor example: a 2L of cola is about 800 calories. An entire large pepperoni pizza is 2240 calories. A 12oz steak is 1000 calories. A full English breakfast is 800 calories. There are 1200 calories in a tub of Haagen Dasz. \n\nBut I cannot imagine anyone would eat a diet of that per day! The cost would be astronomical and the quantity of food is just shocking.\n\nHow do people max out that many calories? \n\n…",
