        "text": "From Latin commūnitās, equivalent to commūni(s) “common” + -tās noun suffix.\n\nA circumstance exists where the English word “community” (and the Spanish word “comunidad”) is being used to mean three different things in the same context:\n\n1. It is being used specifically to refer to a community of property (joint possession, enjoyment, liability, etc.) in the legal sense of a condominium (called a “comunidad de propietarios” in Spain) comprising horizontal ownership of real estate.\n\n2. It is simultaneously being used to refer to “a group whose members reside in a specific locality, share common interests, is perceived and perceives of itself as distinct in some respect from the larger society within which it exists.”\n\n3. It is also being used to refer to “a locality inhabited by such a group.”\n\nAmbiguity and confusion arises from using the same word, in the same context, to refer to any or all of three different meanings.  I’d like to find a way of referring to each of the above meanings so that they can be differentiated from one another.  Can philosophy help?",

Why use those terms instead of; \"pro social behaviour\" and \"anti social behaviour\". With the current terms it feels like there's this judgement made between a selfish and a selfless person, when they just both just act on what their brain reacts to, like, a person that enjoys helping other people and would give their life for it is no better than a person who enjoys killing other people and would give their life for it, the only difference is that one's self interested actions happen to be pro social and the other anti social.",

        "text": "I ask this because in the trans community there is a debate about how we should qualify someone’s gender identity and Sartre’s assertion runs counterintuitive to mine and many other trans people’s belief that our gender identities, or as Julie Serrano calls it: subconscious sex identity, is an identity that precedes the taking of an action. That before I ever transitioned(action) I was a woman in identity( I am assigned male at birth). That my identity as a woman is not necessitated by the act of transitioning. That regardless of the action of taking hormones or getting surgeries or wearing new clothes that I was a woman all along.\n\nThis isn’t to say that I don’t believe that action precedes identity in particular instances such as the truth that in order to call yourself a playwright accurately that you must first write a play. There are many examples of this but it also seems to me that identity can be fixed before any action takes place by an individual as in the sense of gender identity.\n\nFor instance say one were to identify as human. Does the identity of human necessitate an action? Doesn’t the existence of a dead human show that you can have an identity regardless of action since a dead human can commit no action to define itself as human yet is still a human just with the modifier of dead? I’m not sure how sound my logic is but I wanted to pose this question to you folks because Sartre’s assertion has big implications on the nature of gender identity and the fact that we can’t seem to nail down an answer to it seems to present a problem in proving a trans identity to the general public who in turn has the power to oppress us with legislation. The fact that we have to defend the logic of why we should get to exist in a world alongside cis people and that we are valid sucks but it still means we must defend our philosophical right to transition and exist.",

But ought they be blamed for participation in operations that unintentionally kill civilians, or participation in a dubious war in the first place?\n\nSome potential ethical issues/questions I’m interested in:\n\n1. In theory, political leaders ultimately make foreign policy decisions, while the military merely carries them out. To what extent does this absolve soldiers of responsibility for serving in an unjust war?\n\n2. Soldiers joining the military can’t know for certain whether or not they will be obligated to serve in a just war, unjust war, or no war at all. How does this impact the ethics of joining the military?\n\n3. To what extent does a soldier in a supporting role (logistics, medical, etc) bear moral responsibility for deaths/war crimes committed by other members of the military they are (however distantly) supporting with their work?\n\n4. It could be argued that a country’s foreign policy will be carried out regardless of the views or actions of any individual soldier, or even that good people are needed most in unjust situations (replaceability argument). To what extent is this a valid argument for participation in unjust wars?\n\nIf you can give a summary or point me to works that deal with issues like these I would appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hi all! I’m not sure if this is the right place for this post, so please feel free to delete or redirect this elsewhere if not. \n\nI just graduated last May with a double major in Philosophy and Music Composition (cue snarky impractical major jokes) and I’m thinking about going back to school for teaching, but I’m running into some doubts about it given the current teaching climate and my personal interests. \n\nLet me preface this with the fact that I have a genuine interest in working with kids and teaching in general, I just don’t have the experience to know if it would be a good fit. I’m also very introverted, so I’m pretty nervous about teaching  and I know I’ll have to cultivate public speaking skills, but I’m willing to do that. \n\nBasically, if I go into teaching music, I would want to do a masters in music composition to further my own knowledge and cement theory concepts because that’s something I struggle teaching confidently. Ideally, I’d want to teach music at a college level, but the likely outcome would be teaching high school band/choir which is not really something I want to do (I’d rather teach theory/general music). \n\nI’m also interested in creative writing and I frequently write philosophical novels/essays in my free time. I found a neat masters program where half of the courses are teaching courses and half are creative writing. This is appealing to me since I don’t have a background in English, so I could kill two birds with one stone. Unfortunately, it doesn’t include a student teaching component. There is another program in my state (Wisconsin) that has a free teaching program if you commit to teaching in the state for 3-4 years. The program requires a content exam (Praxis 5038) that has a bunch of questions about distinguishing 20 different types of poetry in addition to other English concepts that I lack confidence in given I don’t have a background in English. \n\nI could obviously learn English online using coursera etc and pass the test. But the thing is, I don’t really read poetry and literature. I enjoy it when I do, (especially philosophical literature) but I usually read philosophy/religion/non-fiction essays for fun. This makes me think maybe the interest isn’t really there. \n\nI have also thought about using my philosophy knowledge and becoming a guidance/school counselor and help kids directly. However, from what I’ve researched about it, there is a lot of administrative nonsense and people frequently quit shortly after getting hired. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I don’t want to spend loads of money only to regret it a year later. Am I crazy for thinking I’m qualified to teach anything? Should I consider a different career path entirely? Any and all advice is appreciated!",

But does Hume justify his own use of it to argue against miracles? He literally claims \"where there is an opposition of arguments, we ouht to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations\" and \"\\[what we find to be\\] most usual is always most probable\". If Hume argues we cannot rationally expect the future to resemble the past, why does he then argue that it is more probable for the future to resemble the past (when this claim itself depends on induction to be justified; the circularity problem).\n\nHelp would be appreciated &lt;3",

I will not categorize the wants from either part as \"positive\" nor \"negative\", they simply are wants.\n\nThe Body, not being conscious, has biological desires such as sex, food etc. While the mind being conscious has intentions. Often, desires contradict intentions. Example: - Intention: Go to gym - Desire: Sit on couch\n\nLike a car, there is only one driver acting out the decisions. The driver is always the mind, but the body is in the passenger seat always saying out loud its suggestions as to which direction to turn. Ultimately it's the minds' decision to listen to them or not.\n\nThis is where it gets complicated. What about the desires that are not biological in nature. For example, Intent: Working Desire: Play Videogames\n\nPlaying videogames are not a biological desire from the body. I would use the example of people who have died from playing videogames for too long (from denying the body food) as an example as to why I believe that.\n\nWhere do non-biological desires come from? Is our mind/ consciousness divided into 2? Do we have a higher frequency mind and a lower frequency mind? Or is it the subconscious in the backseat of the car which spurs out those contradicting desires?\n\nSo to bring it all back, what are the components that make me, I?

The best practices of software development recommend to test as early as possible because the latest a defect is found, the more expensive it is to correct it.\n\nAnother great benefit, and I think the more important for me, of focusing on crime prevention is that it saves the victim from the consequences that the crime would have caused them otherwise.\n\nAnother adept comparison would be with healthcare, it's often reminded that prevention by having a healthy life style is preferable and less expensive than medical treatment.\n\nFinally, I'm well aware that something like this could easily get into conflict with notions of privacy and freedom, and quickly devolve into authoritarianism. Taking again the comparison with software development, mass surveillance would be the equivalent of regression testing by UI, that's expensive and the final stage, you. You want to focus on proof reading the documentation, unit and integration test, validate API calls. What I want to say is that I like to think that it would be possible to focus on prevention without falling into totalitarianism.\n\nAnd I'm most probably out of base here and this would vary from case to case, but I think most victims would prefer to be saved before a crime its committed against them than to be compensated afterwards assuming its even an option.\n\nBonus question: Other arguments against crime prevention?",

To readers who are thoroughly familiar with intensional semantics the rough outline of a presentation of my views in these terms should be clear without an explicit development. Never­ th eless, some misunderstandings of the rigidity concept-including some as pects of these mentioned in this preface-led me to think that a technical presentation might eliminate some misconceptions. Eventually considerations of time and space led me to decide against including such material, but I *may give such a formal exposition elsewhere*.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nDid he ever give such a formal exposition? I'm trying to do some work on rigidity and it's formal relations to other phenomena, so a formal definition would be really helpful. Formal definitions by other authors would also be gratefully recieved, though one from Kripke, related directly to Naming and Necessity would be ideal.\n\nTIA",

        "text": "There are a number of sentences that create a paradoxical-seeming ambiguity. I'm not sure what the name for this phenomenon is, and it'd be great if someone could help me out.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\\-\"I don't know what I don't know.\" (tautologically). \"But I do know what I don't know!\" you protest. \"I don't know if the Riemann Hypothesis is true.\"\n\n\\-\"I don't know where the closest BestBuy is.\" But if in fact the closest BestBuy is the one at the Palisades Center mall, and you do know where that store is, then it would seem that you do know where the closest BestBuy is, you just don't know *that* it's the closest one. (I guess one should have said \"I don't know **which** the closest BestBuy is\". But if you don't know which one is closest, you also don't know where the closest one is.)\n\n\\-\"I don't know who the man behind the curtain is.\" But the man behind the curtain is your father. So you don't know who your father is. (\"But I do know who my father is\" you protest.)\n\nMy former professor furnished me with the third example there (about the man behind the curtain), and said it was discussed in the literature. But I can't find any references to it. He said that some writers distinguish between \"knowing of\" and \"knowing that\". That's definitely helpful, but I think I need a deeper understanding of it. I posted this on the linguistics stackexchange, and the post got downvoted, with no answers! What gives?! (Linguistics people don't like philosophy I guess!)\n\nBy the way, other than the verb 'know', the same thing can happen with forget/remember. \"I forget what I've forgotten...\" (Has that ever happened to you?)\n\nIf you can provide links to the literature, or your own opinion, that'd be great. I'm not only looking to \"resolve the paradox\", but also if possible understand the source of it. Is it a \"semantic ambiguity\" in the verb 'to know' as has been suggested? Or scope ambiguity which occurs in sentences like \"Jane didn't come to the party because she was playing video games\"? Or something else? \n\nThanks in advance!!",
