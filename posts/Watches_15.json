        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11pu7x3/omegabreitlingrolexautomatic_chronograph_wrist/",
        "text": "Background: In a previous post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11gos5u/longinesomegabreitlingtag\\_heuerzenith\\_help\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11gos5u/longinesomegabreitlingtag_heuerzenith_help_me/)) I mentioned that I already own an Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch, and I am on the market for a luxury automatic chronograph with a budget of about $6,000-$7,000. I have a wrist size of 7-7.25 inches (17.78-18.2cm). I do use the chronograph function in my daily life and work, so I. Yesterday I went to a reputable AD and tried some watches on. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gwayk5haena1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2523a6f011fddd0f3295b9a502109029f061dc3\n\n1 Omega Speedmaster “Dark Side of the Moon”. New watch. Was not on my short list initially but tried it on and found that it looks very cool on the wrist, though I have to say aesthetically it overlaps significantly with my Speedmaster Moonwatch. Ceramic case is an interesting feature as I’ve never owned any ceramic watch, but I’ve heard varying opinions about the durability. The AD no longer offers pay-in-installment program due to recent economic and financial conditions, so buying this new ($12,000 tag price) would mean I have to double my budget.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tt3fmqxhaena1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=225f2358af1f885740b74027475474383b7935c4\n\n2 Omega Speedmaster Moon phase. Pre-owned, dated 2019, in good condition, box and paper, two years of Omega warranty left. Priced at $7,500 it is a bit of a stretch for me, but a great deal for the price. Moon phase is a cool function, and coupled with the pointer date, the watch offers a different aesthetics than my Moonwatch. On the other hand, the moon phase function may not be very useful for me.\n\n*Processing img lat1xqejaena1...*\n\n3 Breitling Chronomat B01 42mm blue dial. New watch. Another overbudget watch but not by much (about $1,500-$2,000 over if I buy at tag price). I must admit this is a pleasant surprise. I had always found most watches of Breitling to be oversized and too heavy for me, but today the Chronomat feels rather comfortable. I like the dial design and the unique bracelet. Still, this is probably the bulkiest watch of the bunch, and I am not quite sure if I could handle wearing it every day. I am also more concerned about the resale value of this watch compared with other options here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vr0kl82kaena1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=03d5c1439a1be513c674bd4e2b24882b9f01aec6\n\n4 Rolex Daytona Circa 1999. Pre-owned, in good condition, box and paper, AD warranty for 15 months, additional warranty available for purchase. Another overbudget watch: in fact the tag price is three times my budget (AD offers $21,000). But I figure why not give it a try. The Daytonas look very nice on picture, but on wrist I find the dial a bit smaller than I had imagined, possibly due to the relatively thick Tachymeter bezel cutting down the dial size.\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/482ql42vbena1.jpg?width=4624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7b686024f3de2da3846d8e8363ff9e3a79db1a4f)\n\n5 Reference Picture: This is what the 41.5-42mm Speedy Moonwatch looks like on my wrist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nI apologize that my poor photograph skills do not do justice to the true size and aesthetics of some of these watches. Somehow the photos seem to come out wrong and all the watches appear a bit bigger than in my eyes. Probably also related to my wrist angle.\n\nWhat do you think? If you have to pick one for my wrist, which would you choose? \n\nMuch obliged!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'll be traveling for a few months this spring and summer, but still working on NY time. I'd love a cheap but decent watch with dual time zones, something nicer than those plastic Casio digitals.\n\nI don't mind digital per se, but prefer analog. I don't need anything fancy, but might be willing to spend a touch more for something nice enough that I'd also use when back home. That's not a must though, as I already have a day to day watch, a Rado. (I don't want to bring this with me, cus aside from wanting dual zone time, the Rado was my dad's and I don't want to risk theft, loss, etc.)\n\nI was aiming for somewhere in the $75 or under range, that way if it's lost, stolen, falls off in the dead sea, so be it. Also, brand recommendations are welcome, cus though there are some that fit the bill on Amazon, well, it's Amazon, and the thing might break in like 11 days.\n\nAlso, I don't love the huge modern watch faces that are enormous, and tend to like a more classic, small to mid size face. But I'm open. And something water resistant, like general swimming in the ocean safe, not scuba diving or etc.\n\nSorry, I don't really know sizes, measurements, or what else might be helpful in here, but if you ask I will try to answer. Thanks!\n\ntl;dr - recommendations on a men's dual time zone watch \\~$75 or under?",

So I'm having an eye on   Hamilton Khaki Field H70455133  and so far I see that people really like this watch but simultaneously I see some people having some problems/dilemmas with it. I heard that some of the parts of this movement are made of plastic to make it cheaper , if that's the case , does it affect somehow the durability of the movement? Also , some people were saying that even though this was has 100 meters durability - and obviously most of them went only for swimming - they had  some issues concerning it. Finally , some people say that this watch does not like   handwound  and  gears in that part are kinda the weak point of the movement. \n\nThere is also the part of people that has no issues neither concerning the movement nor the watch itself. So , what's your thoughts or experience with it?",

Certainly helps keep my focus on what I really want in the collection.\n\n\\- G-Shock GD-350  \n\\- Suntuu Core All Black  \n\\- Nixon Regulus  \n\\- Nixon Unit - Boba Fett edition   \n\\- Citizen Titanium Promaster BN0220-16E  \n\\- Citizen Titanium 'Ray Mears' Monobloc 300m   \n\\- Seiko Limited Ed. Baby Tuna SNE577P   \n\\- Seiko 'Safarni' SNJ029P  \n\\- Seiko Prospex SPB239J1  \n\\- Citizen Titanium Automatic NB6021-17E (black)  \n\\- Citizen Titanium Automatic NB6021-68L (blue)  \n\\- Citizen Titanium BN0200-81E\n\nThe Seiko SPB239 and two Citizen Titanium Automatics appear to be my dream size and design. I cannot get enough of them and love how they can be dressed up, down and all around.\n\nThe G-Shock GD-350 is my ultimate work watch.\n\nI have a 7\" wrist but still thankfully able to really enjoy the 'bigger' watches like the Arnie, Tuna and the larger 'square' Promaster thanks to great lug to lug designs. They make these larger pieces so incredibly wearable. Ignore the general rule of watch sizes when thinking about these variants.\n\nThe Star Wars Nixon Unit is a surprisingly great piece. Large, comfortable and super fun being a fan of Boba Fett. My wife gave me this watch and I adore it for that alone, not just the fact I really do like it.\n\nThe Nixon Regulus is a very under rated watch and can be had for a bargain on their sales / secondary. A great beater with loads of colourway options.\n\nOnly been collecting watches in the last 6-12 months, but loving the way this is going so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf09bp9ajdna1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f4cf4d37b0673007a65a59022697da2c4682eafb",
