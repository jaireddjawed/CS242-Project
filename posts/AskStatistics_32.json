I'll try to be precise in how I word this, and thanks so much for the replies in advance!\n\nRight now I'm trying to determine the most proper way to approach estimating the parameters of my sample along with a  two sided t\\-test to determine the efficacy of a treatment on a particular subject.  We have a lot of subjects, and a lot of historical data with respect to their height, weight, blood pressure, etc.  I've done a fair amount of exploratory analysis on this history (box plots, histograms, and plotted empirical distributions for each subject to determine how \"nicelyeach subject looks).  Most of the subjects have really nice data over their respective variables\\-but some do not, more on this part later (for instance, the concentration of a particular antigen in their blood is approximately normal w.r.t each patient, and for all patients\\-but some are just plain gross!).  I plan on fitting some well\\-defined pdfs to this data and computing the first few moments to be used for some t tests.\n\nBack to the original question\\-some of the data is not nice w.r.t some patients\\-and I'd like to start running some non\\-parametric bootstraps to determine some 95 &amp;#37; confidence intervals (using the empirical bootstrap method) for the mean and variance of these subjects and then use them in the construction of a t test.  I'm a bit hung up though\\-because I'm not sure how to proceed in passing my computed values to my t test (it's been a long time since I've been familiar with the theoretical material behind bootstrapping\\-and I don't want to just plug in the point estimate of the mean and be done with it).  As I am treating my mean and variance as unknown parameters prior to the running the bootstrap, and drawing some assumptions regarding the theoretical distribution of the data (here I'm assuming normality)\\-do I need to \"adjust\" my t test construction to properly test the hypothesis that any observation falls within a given side of a bootstrapped confidence interval for a particular parameters (and consider the sub cases in terms of the other parameters i.e. consider the probability of the mean falling within the upper bounded region of the CI, given the variance falls in the lower bounded region of the computed CI and do the same for the case it is above).\n\nThanks again!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm aware that you can have a scalar that is described by a particular probability distribution. If you sample the population enough times you can choose a PDF and its parameters which match the samples well and would hopefully be a good estimate of the real population. What I'm trying to do is the same thing for a curve (X\\-Y) instead of a scalar.\n\nTake the following [image](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changsheng_Wu3/publication/303846986/figure/fig3/AS:375865092395012@1466624629685/Stress-strain-curves-from-uniaxial-tensile-tests-of-3-replicates-and-simulation-of-SW1.png). Ignore the \"Simulation\" line and focus on the 3 replicates. It's quite typical for engineers to do tensile pulls on material specimens and get results similar to that image. The curves can take on many shapes, though I can say that they'll start at the origin, monotonically increase, and generally be smooth. It is possible for replicates to cross each other. See this [image](https://gallaghercorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/comparison-chart1-2.jpg) for a comparison of a few curves for different materials. Some are nearly linear, others have significant nonlinearity, and I've seen much more dramatic nonlinearity than is shown in this image. What I'd like to do is given a set of these curves from a single material (with an arbitrary number of replicates), be able to generate a new curve which is a sample from the distribution defined by or fit to the tested replicates.\n\nOne method I thought of was to fit a polynomial (or other smooth) function to the data, e.g. y\\_hat = mx \\+ b. Then add a distribution, e.g. y\\_hat \\~ mx \\+ b \\+ N(0, sigma). I'm not a huge fan of this approach, as I'm not sure how to properly find sigma, nor am I sure it'll work robustly if I could do that. \n\nIs anyone aware of a way to do what I'm looking for? The reason I want to do this is rather in depth, but I'll try to describe it. The stress\\-strain curves are used to generate a material model. This material model is a mathematical description that has a bunch of coefficients that are generally found through a parameter estimation procedure. This model\\+coefficients is then plugged into a finite element simulation where loads can be applied to a structure and predict if the part will break, deform how we want, etc. As part of an uncertainty quantification procedure on the finite element model, I want to propagate the uncertainty in the material stress\\-strain curve through to the finite element model outputs.

I'm using data from past NCAA Men's basketball games (basically each entry is a game, features are things like field goals made, field goals attempted, assists, turnovers, etc, and the label is whether the home or away team won). So far, I have fit a logistic regression model and a KNN model. The LogReg model is over\\-fitting, as it had 100&amp;#37; accuracy during 10\\-fold CV, and also correctly predicted last year's VT @ UVa upset. My theory behind this is that after training, the model simply just adds up the total number of points from field goals, 3 pointers, and free throws (essentially), and chooses the team with the highest total points. With this being said, would you guys suggest using this model?  To test the VT@UVa game, I simply input the team stats from the game, but I feel like I should use the seasonal averages for the teams (but I don't see how this would help the possible summing issue). Or would you guys personally implement KNN, or maybe a Random Forest or even a Neural Net? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated!",

I have the total number of patents that they filed for as well in the same timespan as well as which year each patent was filed in.\n\nI would like to compare my list of companies that have collaborated with the institute, with the other list of random companies that didn't collaborate with the institute and see if there have been any significant changes to the companies in terms of more patents filed, after they collaborated with the institute. My data with the random companies serve as a \"test group\".\n\nWhat I've done so far is made a t test based on the total number of sum of patents for each companies for my two data to calculate their t-score.\n\nI've also tried to apply a linear regression model with the total number of patents for each company as the dependent variable (y) and the companies as the independent variable (x) and my idea is to look at their slope to see if the collaborating companies have a bigger slope, in which case it would mean that they've patented more on average compared to the non-collaborating companies.\n\nAfter this, I'd like to dig deeper into the specific years and look at the earliest collaboration year for the companies that collaborated with the institute, and look if the output of patents changed significantly after they first started collaborating with the institute compared to before they collaborated.\n\nDo you think that this sounds feasible? Do you have any further suggestions for statistical models where I can take this one step further? Thank you very much for your input.",

So for a given sip of fluid which was then aspirated, the fluid was either thick/thin and the aspiration was either silent/non-silent.\n\nI looked through hundreds of archived radiology reports and picked out instances of aspiration. So my data set consists of \"aspiration events.\" Sometimes one patient aspirated only once during a study, sometimes they aspirated more than once. Sometimes a patient may have have multiple exams on different dates, with aspiration occuring on only both or one of them. I had to count \"aspiration events\" rather than people because my variables don't remain constant with one person but can change swallow-to-swallow.\n\nI read in my stats book, _Discovering Statistics Using SPSS_ by Andy Field on page 735:\n\n&gt; For the chi-square test to be meaningful it is imperative that each person, item or entity contributes to only one cell of the contingency table.

This paper tries to tackle that question by looking at a few states in the US where physician assisted suicide has been legalized. They look at the suicide rates before and after the policy intervention and also try and control for various predictors of suicide, such as the unemployment rate. They also try and answer a second question, does the mean age of a person who commits suicide also increase? I'm personally not interested in this question, just the first one. The policy has been around in Oregon since 1998, but not that long in the other states, so I'm mostly interested in the effect found in Oregon. The authors also run two models for two age groups, under 65 and over 65, but once again it's not of interest to me. \n\nThere are lots errors to pick at with the methodology of this paper, but I'm specifically concerned with the statistical models they used. Basically, I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish. \n\n&gt;We constructed graphs of rates of total deaths by suicide and deaths by nonassisted suicide for Oregon and Washington and rates of suicide for Montana. In each case, we compared these with the rates in all of the other US states. We then used grouped logistic regression to estimate the association between PAS [the physician assisted suicide policy intervention] and suicide rates... The coefficient on PAS can be interpreted as the estimated percentage change in suicide rates associated with the legalization of PAS states.\n\n&gt;For the logistic regressions, we used HuberWhite standard errors, which control for heteroskedasticity... We highlighted estimates that are significantly different from zero at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels\n\n&gt;In each regression, we included an indicator (dummy) variable for each state and each year. These control for unobservable\nstate- and year-fixed effects, respectively, and mean that the coefficient on PAS legalization can be interpreted as the average\npercentage change in suicide rates before and after the legalization of PAS relative to the change during the same time period\nin states that did not legalize PAS. We estimated further specifications of our models in which we included independent\nvariables measuring factors that previously have been found to be associated with suicides: the proportion of the population\nthat is black, the proportion that is Hispanic, the proportion of the population that adheres to a recognized religion, the\nunemployment rate, the annual per capita disposable income, whether marijuana was legal for medical reasons, whether\nmarijuana was decriminalized for recreational purposes, and whether a 0.08 blood alcohol content law was in place. We also\nestimated a specification that includes state-specific linear trends. These help control for state-specific effects that change gradually over time and that are not captured by other variables, although they decrease the residual variability in the dependent variable and in the covariates. As a result, they may reduce the power of the tests to recognize effects as significant.\n\nI believe this is every quote from the methodology section that pertains to what I'm interested in. I'm unsure of how this statistical model is able to answer the question. ",

We think the variable can predict an outcome (mortality) in a certain medical condition. ROC area under curve for the variable in the whole cohort is 0.68 so not great but reasonable. What we would like to do is derive a threshold for mortality (e.g. if the value of the variable is &gt;5 then patients have a 1% risk of death at 1 year, if it is &gt;10 then they have a 6% risk of death at 1 year. Etc.\n\nIt is probably worth saying that there are definitely not an equal number of low and high risk patients. We have follow up data of the variable for &gt; 1year.\n\nWe have tried a few ways of doing it and been unsuccessful. Firstly I tried splitting patients into different groups (e.g. 20pts with a value &lt;1, 20 pts with a value of 1-2 etc) and then calculating mortality for the grops, but that didn't work - I suspect because they are not evenly distributed. Then I ran a Cox regression and identified the time at which 5% or 10% had died, but I don't know what to do with this time point and how to calculate a threshold for the value.\n\nI'd be grateful for any pointers in the right direction.

My hypothesis was that the majority will rate the three ratios in the middle higher than the two ratios at the ends.\nMy professor suggested doing one test for equal distribution and one for normal distribution. So what I am struggling with right now is choosing the variables to do those tests. At first I generated two new variables. One contained the mean rating a person gave the two extreme ratios, the other one containing the mean rating a person gave the three middle ratios. I tried doing a Chi square test with those both but the Output seems odd and I feel like I am overlooking something.\nI am using spss.\n\nWould be great if somebody here could help me :)",

I would appreciate your help or advice with this problem and I would also like your insights on conceptual knowledge. I really do appreciate your patience for looking at this huge post.\n\nImagine a 1-D discrete linear world X:0 to inf. Now imagine a ball initially at t=0 s is at x=0 m and it has to move 1 m every 5 seconds. This doesn't mean the ball moves one step after every 5 seconds but rather it has a chance of 1/5 to move 1 m at each time interval between 0&lt;=t&lt;=5 seconds . And also it can move only forward and only in integral multiples of 1 m. Given this information I tried getting some probabilities for the ball for reaching up-to x=3.

What does this mean for the average velocity at a particular 'x' which I think should be |V(x)|=P(t)*V(t) ? Do you think the average velocity will reach a limit? If so why? Is my assessment that P(t) is cyclic correct? If yes, which function is it a fourier series/conjugate of?\n\nThank you. Hope you enjoyed the read at-least?\n",

        "text": "I am having trying to calculate post hoc power for my thesis. Unforunately when I have been doing this I have discovered that I think my a priori calculations are wrong. I am using a generic medium effect size as there was no research to base on effect size on.\nI had initially calculated:\n\nCalculations using G*Power indicated that to achieve a power of .80 when employing .05 criterion of statistical significance in a one-way MANOVA with two levels and three dependent variables using a medium effect size of f2(V)=0.25, a total sample size of N = 48 would be needed (Erdfelder, Faul &amp; Buchner, 1996).\n\nBut my understand is that f2(V) could be .15 OR could be .0625.\nCould anyone help me to resolve this? I would appreciate any references for this either!",

I know it has a constant power spectral density, but the significance of that hasn't really clicked. Or really why its used or error terms are assumed to white noise. Also is white noise always gaussian? what if it isn't? I've also heard white noise defined as when you take samples of it, its always going to be independent. Why is that so? How is it connected to it having a constant power spectral density?",

        "text": "I realize now I need a refresher on statistics. I want to bring up the below test to my boss but as soon as I think about how I would do the statistics, I lose my head. I know Excel would do most of it but I'd have to show sample calculations.\n\n**Problem statement:** show, if possible, that if the number of required batch runs is reduced from 3 to 2 for a de-greasing process of metal, how does it influence the impregnated amount of sealant uptake (mass of sealant in metal).\n\nBasically, lube (mass decrease) is removed from metal, then the metal is impregnated with sealant (mass increase). Batches are about 300 metal pieces.\n\n**My thinking:**\n* Calculate sample batch size for 95% CI, weigh them, then calculate mean mass of total population\n\n* Do this before first run, and after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd run of the de-grease process, calculating mean mass between each\n\n* Then weigh the samples after the impregnation of sealant and weigh them to determine mean weight of total population. this would also give me mean average of mass intake.\n\n* Repeat process for only two de-greasing runs, samples go through sealant impregnation, and compare the mass intake of sealant of the two tests\n\nFrom the link in the sidebar, I think I would use paired t-tests to show if the 3-run data are statistically significant to the 2-run data. Then also do the same with each data set after the sealant is added, to show the difference in amount of sealant uptake is NOT significant.",

If I were to tell you \"I can run as many experiments I want on this system, I know it follows a specific system of differential equations, and I want to find the coefficients in those equations\", who would you start to approach this problem with no knowledge of the physics that determines the coefficients.\n\nTo give an example, imagine I have the system of differential equations and as much y1, y2, and t data as we want:\n\ndy1/dt = A y1\\^2 \\+ B y1\\*y2\n\ndy2/dt = C y2\\^2 \\+ D y1\\*y2\n\nYou could probably do a least\\-squares type optimization to find A, B, C, and D.\n\nBut now imagine there are a lot more relationships:\n\ndy1/dt = A1 y1\\^2 \\+ A2 y2\\*y1 \\+ ... An y1\\*yn\n\ndy2/dt = B1 y2\\^2 \\+ B2 y2\\*y1 \\+ ... An y2\\*yn\n\ndy3/dt = C1 y3\\^2 \\+ C2 y3\\*y1 \\+ ... Cn y2\\*yn\n\nThere are probably too many equations to find the optimum solution in a reasonable time period for A1, A2..., An, B1, B2..., Bn, C1, C2..., Cn. So how would you begin to analyze such a system?\n\nI have some understanding of the relationship between the variables in my case, but I would love an outsider's perspective. Thanks! ",

        "text": "Hey! I am teaching myself how to do statistics, so I apologize if I sound a bit naive. \n\nThe problem I'm working on is below. It is a decision tree. The issue I'm having is I'm not sure how to address a 'statistical range,' if it's even called that. From the text: \n\n\"Good investment conditions should lead to the greenhouse gases reduction of 20-30%...\"\n\nI have the answer to the problem, and on the decision tree they create, the author somehow gets '21.42' from that. Or take another sentence example from the problem:\n\n\"Such scenario should reduce the gases by 10-20%.\"\n\nFrom that, on his decision tree, he gets the number '17.43'.\n\nAny ideas on this? Also, here is a link to the page if you want to see the answer (the completed decision tree). The problem is called\n\"Green Economy – how to care about the environment efficiently.\"\n \nhttps://github.com/SilverDecisions/SilverDecisions/wiki/Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\"Decision problem description:\nLocal government needs to reduce the greenhouse gases in the region by at least 15% in 2 years time. Naturally, the greater the emissions reductions, the better. The specificity of the region enables considering three alternatives.\n\nFirstly, local government may introduce tax credits and grants for wind power energy. This scenario depends on the investment conditions. Good investment conditions should lead to the greenhouse gases reduction of 20-30% within the next 2 years. The chance of an economic slowdown is merely 10%, but then there will be no new green energy investments in the region and consequently no emissions reduction.\n\nAnother alternative is to co-finance the households furnaces replacement. This scenario should decrease the greenhouse gases by 15-30% in case the majority of citizens are willing to participate in furnaces replacement cost. Local government estimates the probability of such situation at 60%. If the majority of citizens is not willing to do so, then emission reductions could be only 10-20%.\n\nFinally, local government may provide free public transport in central zones in line with increasing its standard. This alternative is considered to be 100% success: the overwhelming majority of citizens declares they would switch to public transport if it’s free of charge and in good standard. Such scenario should reduce the gases by 10-20%.\n\nIt is estimated that the long-term costs of all three alternatives could be at the similar level. Local government would like to visualize the decision problem with all its alternatives to make it more transparent and understandable before making any decisions.\"",
