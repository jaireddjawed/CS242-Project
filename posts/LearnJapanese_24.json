But I just suck with vocab and kanji. So i hoped for some games (PC/ Switch) or Apps (android) who helps to lern with Vocab/ Kanji. (Would be best if they support Japanese&lt;&gt;German, I mostly use english Textbooks for learning, but of course it is harder to learn a different language via another language)\n\nI hate learning with flashcards and stuff. So please dont say something like anki. I know I should use it but I'm learning this language in my spare time cause its fun. And doing something which feels more like work just dont feel right. I guess if I got a bit more of basic vocab and kanji I could try mangas. But right now I feel like this would be to hard for my level. \n\nSo maybe there are some who struggle with the same problems. How did you manage it? Do you recommend some games you like?",

Also, how fast one can carry a casual convo and not be fluent per say? For instance, going out to a Japanese dinner and ordering food with casual conversation.\n\nFor me, German was easy to write, but to speak it, was much harder. I am a native English American. I'd have no interest in learning the writing vocabulary much, unless it translated to my goal of just casual speaking.  \n\n\nI am asking because I am looking at holiday deals on certain places to learn, but not sure which is best.",

I thought 400 kanjis was already good for a beginner, but looks like I never stumble across those Kanjis!\n\nVocabulary? Oh gosh, don't even start with it! It's funny how after I've learnt a new word, I never see it again, so I end up forgetting it. I just feel demotivated to continue...\n\nI know I did some progress over this last year. Sometimes I'm listening to a song or watching an anime and suddenly understand something they said, I can read some news, read some mangas... But it all seems so hard now... I don't know how to learn new words, new grammar, how to memorise them.\n\nAlso, I can't really use my japanese in real life like, so I can't put into practice what I've learnt.\n\nI think Japanese is not for me.",

I started learning the Hiragana and Katakana from the PDF guides on [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/), and I'm very happy with my retention. I've been using Anki with the Tofugu cards to quiz myself. I find I can visualize the mnemonics from these guides quite easily.\n    \nTLDR; Wanikani doesn't seem to be working for me, any suggestions to learn Kanji for a person with ADHD?\n\nA few of the guides I've read online mentioned lot's of learners have had success with Wanikani, and I've been going through level 1. This is where I'm running in to troubles. I don't think my learning style matches the Wanikani way. I'm doing well with the Radicals, they make sense to me, but I have little retention on the Kanji after spending about 8 hours over the last week. I can recall the English translation for the Kanji (which is likely why the radicals have stuck) after only a few viewings, but I'm having issues remembering the Hiragana for the Kanji.\n\nI've tried writing out the Kanji with the Hiragana as they come up, and using Wanikanis mnemonics, as well as substituting my own when theirs haven't made sense to me, but it hasn't really helped. Looking at my dashboard I have 3/17 Kanji guru, and 7 leeches.\n\nPart of the issue could be my ADHD, I struggled to learn English in grade school, and wrote memorization has never worked for me. Also, sitting down with a text book and reading to learn has never worked for me.\n\nAt work, I learn best by looking at examples, and then using trial and error to figure out how things fit together. I'm able to retain quite quickly this way. I taught myself enough of the Python programming language to do my job.\n\nI've been reading a few guides, one being the [Year to learn Japanese](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit#heading=h.ff9mg4fv0ytd) as well as posts here on Reddit. But the more I read the more choice paralysis I get. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on an approach I can take based on the information I provided above? I really like the concept of SRS and mnemonics , and hope to leverage those. Am I giving up to soon on Wanikani?",

There were some words I knew the meaning of and I wondered why they chose to translate it they way they did. For example, a high schooler calling her classmate a ばか and netflix translated it as “stupid f*ck.” Isn’t this a little harsh? Also, translating ピンチas “[I’m in] a bind.” Couldn’t you just say “I’m in a pinch”?\n\nI am an absolute beginner at Japanese, I only know ~500 words so someone please tell me if these are common ways to translate, I’ve just been thinking about it. Has anyone noticed other shows with uncommon translations? \n\nI have seen a few C-dramas on Netflix and I’ve seen people say they didn’t like the way they were translated as well so I didn’t know if this was just a Netflix issue.",

        "text": "The \"intermediate plateau\" is a common term that's used often in this coummunity, but what does it really mean? I've gathered 3 common answers I've received over time on this topic and with this post I want to ask you which one has subconsciously been YOUR definition of \"intermediate\".\n\n# (1)\n N4/N3 is intermediate. This follows the logic that since most JP learners don't get past the N5 anyway, anything that's above the norm is above beginner level. N2+ is advanced.\n\n# (2)    \nN2 is intermediate. This is usually the most common opinion. Here N1 is usually considered advanced, and since the N2 tests half of the kanji and half of the vocab compared to the N1, it makes sense for N2 to be in the middle.\n\n# (3)    \nJLPT is too easy and doesn't test enough skills. Anything below N1 is barely the start. Taking the N1 and passing it without a close to perfect score (160+ points) makes you a beginner. This follows the logic that everything that appears in the N1 is normal stuff seen in everyday life, and struggling with it means that you're still learning, or haven't yet mastered, the basics. Here passing the N1 with a high score makes you \"intermediate\", while \"advanced\" simply means being fluent, both conversationally and passively.",

I may forget those things but all I would have to do is relearn it, it does get easier and easier. (Learned from another person on this sub)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Not knowing the proper way to learn Kanji\n\n\\-Because I learned a lot of vocubulary, Hiragana, and Katakana from Anki, I stubbornly stuck to the app and just downloaded some decks on it. \n\nThe problem isn't Anki but the decks I used. One deck provided meaning but no ways to read it in Japanese. The other deck provided the ways to read it in japanese and it's meanings. Only problem is that it had no Furigana text, so on the examples on how to read the Kanji, I had no clue what the various Kanji meant, because its always different.\n\n\\-I went ahead and finally got myself a book on learning Kanji and I finally got myself progress on the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Getting demoralized from this phrase; A single Kanji has a lot of different readings.\n\nI thought it was only Onyomi and Kunyomi, found out later that there were a lot of different readings.\n\n\\-I then read a comment on this sub, they were talking about their learning method; memorizing how that specific Kanji is read along with those specific other characters. Something like that Kanji mixed with that other Kanji or hiragana makes that Kanji get read that way.\n\n\\-One helpful and related thought from Japanesefromzero; he explained about using deduction in identifying Kanji meanings. He explained something like; 1月 is mostly used for representing January. It can be read as 1 moon, but that wouldn't make sense in ordinary Japanese life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Taking a break from learning Japanese\n\n\\-I shouldn't have done that, because I personally lost motivation and interest from Japanese on this break. I got motivated again after a year or 2, but that was after I got desperate from the lack of translated Japanese media, I had to get motivated for an entirely different reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Naive mindset of being content with understanding spoken Japanese                                              \n\n\\-This idea just seems ridiculous to me now, I wouldn't be able to enjoy Japanese media without understanding Kanji.  \nImagine if someone showed me some Kanji and I'd respond with I don't understand what that means. That person would probably be dumbfounded, because I would probably claim that I have been learning Japanese for years.\n\n\\-It would probably negatively impact a Japanese speaker's opinion of me, if I ever do meet one irl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all of the reason I can remember for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Just get a book on Kanji learning. / Just pay for Japanese learning classes.",

        "title": "An analysis of Kanji in the Japanese Clozemaster course",
        "author": "qzorum",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zxk491/an_analysis_of_kanji_in_the_japanese_clozemaster/",
        "text": "In preparation for [my upcoming attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/clozemaster/comments/zl9t4f/which_language_should_i_livestream_myself/) to complete the entire Japanese Clozemaster Fluency Fast Track in 2023, I did a little digging into the contents of the course, to get an idea of just how proficient it could make me. I scraped all 19,999 sentences from the course and ran some textual analysis on them. The results may be useful to anyone considering using Clozemaster to learn Japanese to a proficient level!\n\nIn particular, I was interested in what kanji the course would teach, since I knew there were educational standards around learning kanji and I thought it would be a good way to benchmark progress. The analyses I did simply looked at which CJK characters appeared in sentences without regard for how they were being used or pronounced, since Clozemaster doesn't provide translations or phonetic transcriptions of individual words. Since kanji can be pronounced in multiple ways and have multiple meanings, appearance of a particular character in the course doesn't guarantee full mastery of that kanji, but I think the results I did find are interesting nonetheless.\n\nI pulled the [list of jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) from Wikipedia, which is the list of kanji which are intended to be taught to Japanese students at each grade level, through secondary school. The list comprises 2,136 characters, broken into eight groups:\n\n- Grade 1 (80 kanji)\n- Grade 2 (160 kanji)\n- Grade 3 (200 kanji)\n- Grade 4 (200 kanji)\n- Grade 5 (185 kanji)\n- Grade 6 (181 kanji)\n- Prefecture name characters taught in primary school (20 kanji)\n- Secondary school (1110 kanji)\n\nThe second-to-last category I listed are characters which are only taught to students because they appear in the names of prefectures of Japan; according to the Wikipedia page about jōyō kanji, these are all taught in grade 4, but I included them as a separate category after the rest of primary school because they seem less relevant to learning Japanese as a second language outside of Japan, and because they appear at much lower frequency in the course than other primary school characters.\n\nI looked both at which kanji appear as all or part of the cloze word being tested, and at which appear elsewhere in the sentence. For the most part, kanji which appear in some exercises elsewhere in the sentence also appear in at least one exercise as part of the cloze word. This makes sense given that the cloze word is supposed to be the least common word in the sentence.\n\nHere are my results in a cumulative table. For each level, I list how many of the kanji up to and including that level there are, as well as how many:\n\n- appear in the cloze word in at least one sentence\n-  appear in the cloze word in at least three sentences\n- appear anywhere in the sentence (including the cloze word) in at least one sentence\n- appear anywhere in the sentence in at least three sentences\n\nlevel | # kanji | in cloze | in cloze &gt;= 3 times | anywhere in sentence | anywhere in sentence &gt;= 3 times\n---|---|----|----|----|----\nGrade 1 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 80 | 80\nGrade 2 | 240 | 240 | 238 | 240 | 239\nGrade 3 | 440 | 440 | 433 | 440 | 439\nGrade 4 | 640 | 640 | 621 | 640 | 637\nGrade 5 | 825 | 824 | 801 | 824 | 820\nGrade 6 | 1006 | 1003 | 963 | 1003 | 995\nPrefecture names | 1026 | 1018 | 971 | 1018 | 1005\nSecondary school | 2136 | 1981 | 1506 | 1988 | 1739\n\nI would say that the coverage is pretty good, at least through primary school! 1003 of the 1006 kanji which students are expected to learn by the end of grade six are taught by the course. The three which do not appear are 俵 \"straw bag,\" 后 \"queen,\" and 蚕 \"silkworm.\" I'm not sure how common these characters are in Japanese or why they're not included in the course. Also, of those 1006 characters that Japanese students know by grade 6, all but 11 of them appear three or more times in the course, giving exposure to them in a variety of contexts.\n\nThrough secondary school, there are about 150 jōyō kanji missing from the course entirely, and hundreds more which are not seen more than once or twice. Depending on what level you aim to achieve, this may suggest that the Japanese course is not fully complete, but looked at another way, you will be exposed to over 90% of jōyō by the end of the course! I'm optimistic that if I do manage to complete the course, that it will leave me with a pretty substantial vocabulary that could easily be built upon simply by immersion and media consumption.\n\nIf you'd like to see the codebase I used to generate these results, check it out here: https://github.com/cstuartroe/clozemaster-analysis\n\nAny follow-up analyses I should do? Maybe use kanji frequency lists instead of the education schedule? Take a look at other sentence collections on Clozemaster?\n\nIf you'd like to follow along my attempt to speedrun the course, you can join the discord: https://discord.gg/9S5GeUGM. I'll post when I livestream, and other analytics and thoughts about Clozemaster as a learning tool as I go.",

I hope you are all having a wonderful end of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an independent developer and have been working on Jitaku 字宅, an application specifically designed to help people learn kanji writing using SRS (Spaced Repetition System). I have been using the application myself for about half a year, and have been surprised at how I am now able to handwrite letters and postcards to my Japanese correspondents without having to pre-type the whole message on my computer first.\n\nEven though I agree that Japanese handwriting is no longer an essential skill nowadays, I still think it is nice and enjoyable to be able to jot down a quick message when you have a pen around. Additionally, learning kanji writing also greatly helps with kanji recognition. So I wanted to find a way to make the learning process as efficient and enjoyable as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, you can find the link to the application website (as well as SNS links where I try post japanese content from time to time) here: [https://jitakuapp.com](https://jitakuapp.com)\n\nRight now, only the iOS version is available, but I am planning to start working on the Android version next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJitaku is still a new application and there are still many points that I am working hard to improve, so I appreciate and value any feedback you may have. Thank you for reading this far and hope to see you soon ☺️",

Hopefully the mods are cool with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like you guys to rate my learning  strategy. Thank you in advance for taking the time out of your day to  read this somewhat lengthy post.\n\nCurrently I use Duolingo, Kanji Garden, and Youtube for learning Japanese.\n\nI  use Duolingo for general learning, basic sentences, and  hiragana/katakana. I'm still pretty early on in the course but from the  looks of it, when you reach level 114 (what is currently the final  level) you should be able to take a trip to Japan and have little to no  trouble effectively using the language (i.e talking to people, ordering  food, asking for directions, and all the other stuff you'd need to do).  Obviously you won't become fluent using Duolingo alone, but it does look  pretty good. (especially compared to what it used to be a few years  ago).\n\nI  also write down everything I learn from Duolingo in a notebook. I  format the notes as seen below (hopefully the table doesn't cause issues  for mobile users)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| Hiragana/Katakana | English translation (sometimes useful info about the word like whether  it's casual or formal, what the word can be shortened to for casual use,  etc.) |\n|:-|:-|\n| Romaji  (one line below the kana) ||\n\n \n\nI've written down the kana in the  same way it appears on the standard kana chart. If I can figure out how  to do it, I'll attach pictures to this post using imgur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKanji  Garden is my resource for, you guessed it, learning kanji. I write down  what I learn here as well. It's formatted the same as the table above  except the kana is replaced with kanji and romaji is replaced with the  kun-yomi and on-yomi\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow,  I don't rely too heavily on Youtube. It's really just to help with  grammar, the particles, and overall sentence structure as well as  understanding/using keigo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  only practice writing the characters over and over again occasionally,  but I've memorized hiragana. I don't always recognize a couple of  characters as soon as I see them, but I can sound out most words (even  if I don't necessarily know what they mean). As for katakana, I am still  having a little trouble remembering all of them. Especially the  characters for tsu and shi along with so and n as they're very similar  looking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI plan to buy a few books eventually (hopefully sooner rather than later) but right now I'm sort of limited to what's free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll tips and comments are appreciated. Again, thank you for reading my post.\n\nありがとうございます!",

Whenever I create my own cards with Yomichan, I like to add a picture from Irasutoya, as they tend to be very representative.\n\nI wanted to share how to add such images very fast to new and existing cards. These are the steps:\n\n1. Install the Add-on \"Batch Download Pictures From Google Images\": [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/561924305](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/561924305)\n2. Go to Browse and into your mining deck. \n3. Select the card (or cards using Ctrl/Shift) to which you want to add the Irasutoya image.\n4. On the top bar menu, \"Edit\" -&gt; \"Add Google Images\"\n5. Here you will need to fulfill the sections that you want to use ([https://i.imgur.com/P2s3oCW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/P2s3oCW.jpg)):\n   1. **Source Field**: the field that is going to be used to search for the pictures. I use the kanji only, which is located in \"front\" field of my template.\n   2. **Name**: just the name that you want to give to that search. I call it \"Irasutoya\".\n   3. **Search Query**: this is what is going to be searched for in Google Images. To retrieve the irasutoya images, please search for \"{} site:irasutoya.com\".\n   4. **Target Field**: where the picture is going to be added. I use the \"Picture\" field. \"&lt;ignored&gt;\" should be used for the search queries that you do not want to perform (other rows).\n   5. **Count**: number of pictures that you want to download and add to that field, I go with 1.\n   6. **If not empty?**: this determines what happens if a picture is already inserted. You can select \"skip\" to keep the old picture, \"overwrite\" to remove the old picture and add a new one or \"append\" to keep the old picture and add the new picture as well (you would have 2).\n   7. **Width/Height**: this would be the width and height to which the downloaded pictures would be resized to.\n6. Once you have finalized the settings, click on start and wait until it finishes.\n7. Result: [https://i.imgur.com/DZRRzd2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DZRRzd2.jpg)\n\n**Some notes:**\n\nI would recommend to perform the first try with a single card only.\n\nDepending on the number of cards selected, it will take more or less time. \n\nYou can set the \"Count\" to more than 1 and then manually delete the ones that you do not like.\n\nIf no results are found, no cards will be added.\n\nSometimes, Google Images can also be a good resource, as alternative.\n\n\"Tools\" -&gt; \"Check Media\" from Anki's main menu will be very useful when adding and deleting a lot of images.",

Such as 八重(八—“eight”, 重—“weight”). Or 八江 (八—“eight”, 江—river”) \n\nI like the meaning behind the first name, but could it be used as a surname? Or should I stick to the other meanings if I want to use Yae as a surname?",

I discovered it for is format that some times uses Hakata ben that I'm currently studying ([Hakataben ojisan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjiR1sg0I8o)).\n\nThere's a lot of little things I don't understand. Not talking about Japanese, but culturally. This one is intended for a Japanese audience, and it shows. Transitions between segments of the podcasts and basically all the sound effects used are weird to me. The way they joke and make fun of each other is also really interesting, and little by little growing on me.\n\nAlso, it seems to be more popular on Spotify. On youtube you'll see quite a lot of videos with 2 views (yes 2 !).\n\n\\----\n\nNow let's diversify our sources of natural, casual, Japanese Podcasts. What are yours ?",

Now, the last time I seriously studied Japanese was about 2 years ago.

I'll be in a university, and living in the university dorm. All the other courses are in English, while Japanese is in... Japanese. \n\nI learned English basically by myself after I studied the core grammar by watching youtube videos, writing and reading english books and streaming. I can speak it so well I prefer it over my first language, so I shouldn't have too much of a hard time learning Japanese. But I'm lacking so much confidence and I'm so scared of travelling and living in a foreign country alone... sigh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think!

        "text": "2023 is quickly approaching, and for many of us that means new learning goals to work towards during the new year. I achieved all of my goals in 2022 and some of them I even blew out of the park. I have set a lot of my goals around gradually cutting down on the amount of English exposure that I have, and increasing the amount of Japanese exposure. Because I live in Japan, my goal is ultimately to reach a level where I never have to use English at all in order to live the same way as everyone else around me. I'm taking the \"When in Rome\" proverb seriously. That does not mean to give up my native language, but rather to put it on the back-burner so that it is no longer my primary language. I personally view adopting the language of your host country as your primary language to be an essential step in properly assimilating so I am doing what I can to make that a reality. This meant taking actions such as switching to a job where I can work fully in Japanese, shaking up my social circles, etc.\n\nAnd now as 2023 is about to begin, I see one remaining area that I must change in order to meet this long term goal; and that is regarding internet usage. I find it quite interesting that many advanced-level speakers continue to use the web almost entirely in English. I am also guilty of this. My primary language learning goal for 2023 is to change my internet habits by ceasing to use English websites and replacing them with Japanese alternatives and I would like to invite you to join me!\n\nThroughout December I have been gradually increasing the amount of time that I spend on Japanese websites. I have used them casually in the past, but now it's time to get serious because starting January 1st the majority of my time online has to be in Japanese. \n\nMost of my English exposure online currently comes from Reddit and 4chan. Basically everything has a Japanese alternative, and these two websites are no exception. For example instead of browsing Reddit or 4chan there are sites like 5ch, おーぷん2ch, as well as many others (personally I recommend finding a good まとめ site to follow so that you can find the interesting threads more easily - I like hamusoku). Instead of English news sites, read Japanese news sites. [Did you know that there is even a Japanese alternative to this very subreddit where your questions will be answered by native speakers and advanced learners?](https://chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/category/2078297843/question/list) I also deleted my English YouTube account entirely.\n\nI understand that only a very specific type of person can share this same goal with me, but anyone can aim to use Japanese more online so I want this thread to be a hub for sharing corners of the Japanese web that you enjoy so that others can add them to their bookmarks as they work towards using Japanese more online. Here are some of my favorite websites:\n\n* アキバ総研 (otaku news site)\n* syosetsu (web novels)\n* キミラノ (good for finding light novels to read)\n* ハムスター速報 (まとめ site)\n* 4Gamer (gaming news)\n* The 日本語 board on 知恵袋 (r/learnJapanese alternative)\n* Not a website, but I like the Smart News app to find articles to read across a variety of topics.  Anything from news to otaku stuff, celebrity nonsense, etc. Great app. \n\nIf you need help finding an alternative for reddit or 4chan that suits your style, you could also check [the Japanese BBS directory.](https://bbsdirectory.neocities.org/) Personally I enjoy all of the high-traffic BBS sites but I think just 5ch is probably enough for most people.\n\nSo, what corners of the Japanese web do you enjoy?\n\nThis will probably be my last major thread unless I come back to share a learning tool or something. Otherwise, I hope to be gone from here after December 31 in order to meet my goal, so I look forward to shitposting with you all in Japanese.",

I thought it was a great resource because there were tons of people seriously learning English and also very interested in making English speaking friends. Switching my language to Japanese however has been a different story. \n\nI don't ever get DMs from people randomly, and the ones I reach out to have been seemingly uninterested in language exchange or making new friends. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong (maybe I'm being too forward and weird)? I'm a guy and have stuck to PMing other dudes because I figure most woman already have a full message queue. Maybe I'm a bit too old for the app considering that I'm getting pretty close to 30 (man that's weird to say)? Maybe the app has just changed in the years that have passed. I really don't know.",
