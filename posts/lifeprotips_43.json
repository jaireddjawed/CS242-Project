        "text": "With winter upon us and oil prices still quite high many of us in the northern hemisphere (myself included) are feeling the strain of high heating costs. Fortunately there is one easy solution that we can all take to reduce energy usage and that is to ensure our homes are well insulated against the cold. One of the biggest sources of heat loss in many houses (especially older homes) is leaks, especially around windows and doors. Fortunately you don't need a fancy thermal camera or heat gun to search for leaks, simply wet the tips of your fingers and run them near gaps and seams around the house to feel if there is any cold air coming in. Thanks to the power of evaporative cooling you can easily feel even very small drafts that would otherwise go unnoticed. This method can help you accurately determine were additional sealing might be needed. For small gaps caulk can work well and excess can be wiped away with a damp paper towel. For larger gaps in areas that are not normally visible (especially in basements) spray foam works well, but be careful as it's very easy to make a mess. Also make sure your exterior doors are properly sealed with weather stripping. With just a few hours and under $20 in materials you can start saving money and extend the life of your furnace.",

So you'd probably need to work out with your land lord a way that you can interact with the leasing agent who will sell the unit. Make sure they communicate to each person they show the unit to the options. \n\nIf you can't get to communicate with them, do you best to have a **delayed move out date**. I.e., tell your land lord you want to move out a few months ahead and you have signed another lease. This normally can get them to do showings earlier while you are in the unit. And since you are in the unit, you can easily mention that you want to sell your stuff. Same if you are visiting a unit you can try to buy it. \n\nThe worst they can say is no.

        "text": "Hi, i've posted about this before so i hope it's ok to make another post about it providing more information. Maybe i'm just really desperate for advice. \n\nI dated a girl for 2 months, and since she broke up with me 3 weeks ago i've been way more heartbroken than i've ever been over longer relationships. Tbh the pain is pretty bad and i'm still having a hard time sleeping etc. We dated for a short time but with alot of contact: texting and calling all day and meeting up a few times. The breakup came out of nowhere when her ex suddenly returned who she was with for 6 years. \n\nI feel like i now have a way too perfect picture of her in my head, because she broke up with me in the 'honeymoon stage'. I didn't have the chance to see anything bad about her or anything i really disliked. All the times we met up we were intimate, cuddled, watched movies and talked. We never went anywhere outside of the house so i have no idea what that would've been like. We also never had an argument or annoyance or anything like that yet.  \n\nThe last date we had went really good and she said i should've stayed longer and she missed me. A week after that things completely changed because her ex came back and confessed his love to her, they had been broken up for 7 months. She said she didn't expect this and is now really confused. She told me she can't continue dating me and needs to figure things out and i should continue too. After that we met up 3 more times, which was basically us being emotional and mostly her comforting me. I think that made me fall for her. After she broke up with me it felt like i wanted her MUCH more and was way more invested in her. When i was with her it wasn't even all that exciting, we didn't have any deep conversations, i never felt a spark, and sex/kissing her wasn't all that great either. I was just really comfortable with her and i guess i got attatched to it. It was only after the breakup that i realized i really wanted her.\n\nI did send a few long (maybe a bit dramatic) texts after the breakup, but not in a way of begging her or getting angry. Just coming across a bit needy. That might've turned her off completely idk. The last text she send me sounded quite distant, saying she was very busy but would give me an update in the future on her thought progress and situation. Appartently she's still not back with her ex at this point. I don't have any hope because i can just tell by the way she talks and the slow replies that she's probably done with me. I still look at her pictures which is a really bad habit. In a way i feel like i lost 'the one', but at the same time i know that's very unrealistic and we might not even be competible at all. Because it's so short i can only fill in the blanks myself. \n\nWhat is the best way to deal with this?",

You have tried all sorts of deodorants, but it never holds for more than half a day.\n\n\nIt might be your washing machine‘s / detergent’s fault. If the odorous bacteria aren’t properly washed off of your clothes, wearing them will cause those bacteria to multiply and bam! You’re already stinky.\n\nConsider using antibacterial detergent for a while and see if you stink slower.\n\n\nAlso consider cleaning your washing machine (they usually have cleaning programs, there’s also advice online, you should be doing this anyway!). Rule of thumb, if it smells bad when you’re not using perfumed softener, it needs a clean.\n\nSource: female friend of mine who struggled for years having to shower sometimes twice a day and wash her clothes everyday. Now she can wear her clothes for 3 days and do sports without shame.",
