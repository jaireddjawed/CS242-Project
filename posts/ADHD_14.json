        "text": "I am a 23 Male, I've just got diagnosed with ADHD after suspecting it for a long period of time, Which gave me enough time to monitor myself.\n\nThe reason I'm posting this because I've always appreciated some of the pros ADHD gave me and their effect on my life and me being out-going and experiencing all that I have experienced. \n\nAnd as-well trying to deal with the cons that make me suffer, so here it goes.\n\n**The pros I have:**\n\n1- Multi talented: I tend to have a talent in different non-related areas and this feels great and gives me the feeling of having it all but I will mention this in the cons as well for another reason.\n\n2- Abundance of thoughts and ideas: I have too many thoughts and too many ideas and too many approaches to different situations, too many POVs to look at at most given situations. Too much information is always in my mind and I am always open to exploring more and more and more.\n\n3- Creativity: I feel extra creative in different areas which feels like a sum of the last two points.\n\n4- Hyper-focus: When I feel like doing something or feel like I am interested in a certain task I do feel hyper focused on finishing it and being creative whilst doing that, For example try giving me a set of LEGOs and watch some miracles.\n\n5- Career: If ADHD does not sabotage my career it will probably make it hella interesting because summing the above points and using them in my career gives me the opportunity to do something creative\n\n6- Being super active and out-going: I tend to have unlimited energy and excitement/seek for adventure and doing all sort of crazy shit especially if its done on 1-hour of sleep ;P\n\n7- Loving: Based on my one and only true love experience I know that I am a once in a lifetime lover, I would love-bomb my partner, keep them interested, shower them with emotions and cheering, Go the extra 100 miles for them, etc etc..\n\n8- Multi-tasking: I sometimes tend to multi-task pretty well and precise. It mostly happens when I have no other option but doing that so as usual gotta do it better than anyone else and quicker than everyone :D.\n\n**The cons I have:**\n\n1- Inattentiveness: When I’m in my own head or not interested in the subject no matter how important it is, I tend to give so low attention to it.\n\n2- Mood swings: I hope its not because am a Gemini hehe, My mood tends to roller coast so hard and on a huge scale, From having hope and optimism in every goal I have to feeling like having zero chances to achieve any of them.\n\n3- Difficulty in forming habits: I tend to have zero discipline when forming new habits, Healthy or not it just feels like I am moving by motivation not discipline. This causes me shit-ton of trouble when I am trying to improve at work, college, exercise, and more.\n\n4- Disinterest: I often feel disinterested in matters that might mean a lot to others, for example a friend achieving something good in their career or their relationship, Most probably if i can’t find a way to relate to them I wont be interested so I tend to fake it to make them feel better/not hurt the feelings of those I am close to.\n\n5- Easiness of detachment: I tend to de-attach easily from most people who are supposed to be close to me unless its a partner or THE partner whom with It gets extremely impossible to detach.\n\n6- Multi talent: Having this as a pro has its con since I am never able to be professional or an expert at a certain talent before I jump to the next so eventually I cant compete with experts in each talent which makes me feel not enough, Its like I want it all &gt;:D.\n\n7- Finally the conclusion of my cons: Being this person who can not excel at a certain habit/talent/job makes me feel like all the areas I have experience with in my life are just incomplete “Not Enough” , Cannot excel academically and only study when I really need to, Cannot stay at a certain job for months unless it becomes a routine and as soon as I get time off I feel like the reset button has been pressed, Cannot treat my parents as I should and tend to get in all types of arguments/fights with them on different matters and mostly I feel and know I am right but I always feel bad for being so harsh and cold with them after an argument, Can’t decide on a certain talent/career to pursue thus feeling like I am wasting time and falling behind in life. Conclusion of this is the person I love the most and see that deserves so much and has so much potential is me and the person I hate the most and have bad feelings of being incomplete, unable to compete and not so worthy is also me. :D",

        "text": "I've been diagnosed with ADHD. While depression isn't diagnosed, I definitely experience all of the symptoms, especially in the morning when I get up and immediately deeply feel sadness.\n\nI don't know. Right now I'm doing fine but can't do my chores or focus tasks because they're boring and painful. So I end up playing video games and browsing social media all day, even though I have the energy to walk and pace around, and I constantly need music and stimulation.\n\nAnd then there are weeks where I'll suddenly drop into a really depressive episode. Won't go into details for fear of triggering people when it's unnecessary. But it basically makes me experience the worst and most painful sadness and emptiness to the point where I can only lay in bed. It seems to really come and go and I'm not sure what triggers it, so I'm constantly waiting for the next one.\n\nI'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow after having to fight with my doctors and therapists for three whole years to even get diagnosed or seen, I kept hearing \"meds won't fix you, you still need the work.\" I understand that, but I just want the tools, I just need *something* to help me swim. I've been trying forever on my own.\n\nAnyway, now that the day is finally there (tomorrow), I'm not sure which ones I should ask for. I'll ask my psychiatrist what they think, but TBH I'm just scared of picking the wrong option in case they ask me what I prefer and struggling and suffering for longer. This is also on the assumption that I can't have both.\n\nPeople with ADHD/depression; psychiatrists, anyone; what is your experience?",

        "text": "I (30F) recently started Jornay PM 80mg. \n\nIt’s only been 5 days but I like it so much more than adderall, adderall was just too intense for me &amp; I kept forgetting to taking it in the AM so I wouldn’t benefit from it’s effects until mid-day &amp; then would be up all night.  \n\nJornay is working for me because it’s easier to remember to take it at the end of the day &amp; I can actually wake up on time because if it’s effects. That’s probably the best benefit. It just helps me start off my day punctually, with energy &amp; I sustain that throughout my work day. I also seem to have a better sense of time, or at least time just goes by slower &amp; I get more done. Vs when I don’t take it I’m drowsy all day and time goes by fast, I have the worst sense of time.\n\nNow here are the downfalls… \n\nI can’t eat on it. My appetite is gone &amp; I force myself to eat but it feels like I’m going to throw up from forcing it. But I know I need to eat because if I don’t, I feel lightheaded &amp; faint. ESPECIALLY when I was on my period, I thought I was literally going to pass out. This eating problem also sucks because it’s interfering with my workout goals. I’m trying to lose a little weight, build muscle. But I can’t barely finish a protein bar or shake while on JornayPM. I definitely can’t workout on it because Im not eating enough. \n\nI sometimes can’t think straight on it because it gives me some anxiety &amp; I feel lightheaded (probably bc of the eating problem). The anxiety is not as bad as with adderall but it’s there. \n\nDid anyone else experience these symptoms? Any tips on helping subside them or how long I can expect it to last before I build a better tolerance to it?",

        "text": "As a preface to this post, I want to say that I fully recognize the dangers of tampering with medication. **I do not want to do this, and none of this would be remotely necessary if the DEA got their shit together and raised quotas.**\n\nThat out of the way, I’ve tried a variety of stimulants with my doctor over the past year and the one we have settled on currently is Mydayis, a 16hr extended release form made by Takeda.\n\nThe problem that I’m running into right now is that I’m very concerned about developing dependence on the drug. Everyone knows that amphetamines are dangerous, and I’ve noticed some withdrawal symptoms on days I don’t take it which are pretty minor, but still enough to scare the shit out of me.\n\nI’d really like to switch to taking a combination of Mydayis on some days and instant release on days I don’t need it as much so that I can lower my dosage and have it in my system less. That said, I’ve called well over a dozen pharmacies in my area by now and not a single one has anything instant release.\n\nHas anyone tried separating the beads of their Adderall XR/Mydayis/similar and crushing them to get two or three doses of “instant” release by bypassing the delay mechanism? My thought is that I could perhaps do that to split up the Mydayis and not need to find a place to get IR. I know that this is potentially dangerous (especially because powderized “IR” will hit me faster than a normal pill would, but I’m not overly scared as it would still be only a fraction of what my body usually handles in a day.\n\nDoes anyone have experience or at least thoughts about this idea?\n\nThank you, r/adhd!",

I might make another post going more in-depth on the existential side of this, but the gist of it is that I have values and intentions that would make me a good person, but the ADHD intention-behavior gap prevents those values from being reflected in my actions. So when I judge myself based on my actions, I see myself as a failure and also an asshole. \n\nI want to find a job that I can thrive in, something fulfilling, but I'm realizing that all jobs are going to have the same common requirements (8hrs continuous work, punctuality) that I can't consistently meet. Capitalism won, jobs are everything, and I am incompatible with jobs. Why do I think I could get a better job when I can't even succeed at my current one?\n\nI have never been able to see myself more than a month or two in the future, so of course I can't picture a future where I'm happy. I guess I just need to know it gets better. Tell me what has worked for you.",

Zoloft is at night. \n\nDuring the day I feel moments where my mind starts to go wandering and I need to close my eyes. My sleep schedule is erratic due to needing to wake up at 3:30 AM for work. Even if I go to sleep early, I seem to wake up after one complete sleep cycle. \n\nI've been told by my psychiatrist that I can taper down the Zoloft to 150MG if I felt like it. I've attempted research but the results are a bit murky. If anyone has comments or suggestions, it would be appreciated.",

So I went to my local hospital's website and found a directory of all of their healthcare providers.  I found a Physician Assistant that had behavioral psychiatry listed as a specialty, and ADHD (and some others) as her main focus.  So I just called her office direct, told them I was a new patient looking for an appointment, and they got me in later in the week.  \n\nWent to my appt, did the normal vitals (weight, blood pressure, etc..) then sat and talked to her for about 40 min.  Some was going through some questionnaires she had, other was just conversational.  She then said I 100% had ADHD and decided to start me on a small dose of medication so I could see if I noticed a difference (5mg focalin, 2xday).  The only real delay was that since she's a PA, her prescriptions have to be approved and submitted by a Dr., but they were ready to pick up at my pharmacy the next morning.  \n\nSeems like a lot of folks don't realize that in most states, PAs can prescribe meds, and can have an extensive background in psychiatry and behavioral issues.

Around two months ago, I started getting some weird symptoms when I'd take it.\n\nIt's usually around the two hour mark, or when it starts to feel the medicines wearing off that the weird symptoms begin. I begin to feel dizzy, my blood doesnt get enough to my head and I'm about to pass out. I get a sort of stabbing sensation accompanied by twitching in the back of my head. Finally, I get a stabbing feeling about 5-6 ribs down by my heart for awhile. \n\nThere's a couple things I think it could be which begun in the first month I had this. Due to the shortage, my medicine could've been reformulated temporarily, so something in the filler could be giving a poor reaction. I'd also started drinking much more coffee during the first month, I don't anymore, but I wonder if I could've stressed my heart and it hasn't healed. I have a blood pressure cuff at home which has been showing me with pre-hypertensive levels during the times I feel worst, but nothing crazy. \n\nMy primary care doctor has been booked until next week, but when I first called to make the appointment, they told me to just go to urgent care. Untreated ADHD causes havoc on my personal and work life, and no other medicine or dosage then the one I'm currently prescribed helps me. Has anyone ever experienced symptoms like this? Will urgent care just cut my dosage or take me off my medication entirely if I go to them? What should I do?",

Can this happen with stratera as well? Currently trying to cut caffeine out as much as possible cause of addiction and was subbing it out with decaf coffee and decaf Earl Grey. \n\nWhat happens if you miss a dose? Do I need to take it at the same time every day?\n\nWhat are typical side effects?\n\nWhat are some negative side effects to keep an eye out for? Do I just stop the meds or wean off if there's and issue? \n\nI've heard people say their meds made them feel like a zombie. Is this common with stratera?\n\nDid you feel like your personality changed? \n\nParents specifically - did it affect your parenting at all?

        "text": "I've been pretty devastated because I made a multitude of mistakes at work this weekend, and it feels so awful.\n\nTo give a rundown of my job and the situation, I print stickers and decals from online orders to ship out. I work three days (Thursday and weekends) for 8 hours each and need a ride to and from work. Thursday is the only day where I'm working when all my other coworkers are there—this is when I ONLY do formatting (making the designs and cutlines from the stickers), and it's what I do all day. My other coworkers are mainly the ones working the printers for the most part. However, the weekend is when I'm there all by myself (Saturday) or with one other girl, and she mostly works on packaging and is nice, by the way (Sunday). I've worked here for almost 5 months.\n\nA few weeks ago, a guy who would format a lot of our orders for us was let go, so my weekends have now been mostly dedicated to formatting what he used to do (for these particular items, we usually get 100+ new orders a day). And since I'm pretty much by myself on the weekend, I also have to make sure all printers and the sticker cutter are running consistently and correctly, and keeping everything its printing rolled up and not all over the floor. These are big printers, by the way, and the vinyl rolls it prints on are about 52 inches in width, 150 feet in length. Occasionally, I will have to replace these rolls when it runs out (I am a 4'10, 20 year old female, so this is a little difficult, but I'm able to do it).\n\nThis morning, I got a text with 4 main mistakes made over this past weekend.\n\nFirst of all, the wrong type of vinyl had been loaded onto the printer near the end of the day, causing a HUGE amount of orders to need to be reprinted on the right one. Second, I couldn't finish formatting all the orders I had been assigned that Sunday since I spent a good hour or two finishing about 20-30 orders from the previous day (there were about 100 on Saturday with about 70-80 more being assigned on Sunday, and these aren't the only things I format everyday). As a result, a lot of these were left unfinished by the time I had to leave, and he was obviously not happy that someone else had to do them. Third, my manager said that we barely printed any of a specific type of order loaded on one of the printers, which was true. I'm not sure how this one happened, but maybe there was a gap of time I forgot about where I wasn't catching up on other orders I had to print BEFORE getting to the ones he said should've been done. And lastly, an order had been cut incorrectly (too deeply) which he said could've been avoided if we checked the force on the printer, which is also true.\n\nI'm sure my manager didn't mean the text to come off as aggressive or disappointed as I took it, but it's hard not to feel bad, still. Me and my coworker have already replied, apologizing and promising to do better, but it's still plaguing my day. Even if maybe these weren't ALL my fault, it still feels like it is, and I feel terrible that I could've avoided this by just being more careful.\n\nTLDR; made multiple mistakes at work while working by myself. I acknowledged them already, but feel awful about it and am having a hard time coping",

I sat there reading and rereading to cut out unimportant details.\n\nI summed it up in the first paragraph because I felt like he might not actually read it more than that. Then I continued the message with the background of what happened and how the new meds felt and why I liked the old ones better. I asked if he could make the next dose the lower dose. I didn't think he could just send in a new prescription because it's a controlled substance.\n\nHe messaged me simply saying that he sent in the new script and to make sure I dispose of the other meds at the pharmacy. In my head, his short and simple response means that he didn't read or didn't care about what I had to say. I know that's just my insecurities.\n\nEven in this post, I can't help but over explain my over explaining. How do I feel less insecure and just be me.

I’ve tried 4 or 5 medications and am coming back to Adderall IR 15mg twice daily after trying it a few months ago and not being sure of it was right for me. Video games have been a significant part of my life, and friendships, since I got my sega genesis at age 7. My friends and I poured hours in to playing games together and I still have those same friends today. I love getting into single player, story based games and that’s how I have decompressed and relaxed in my adult years with the stresses of parenthood and business ownership. I played nearly every evening but not to the point it was a problem. My wife always supported it and I would ask her occasionally if she thought I was playing too much and she always said no. She’s a clinical social worker and therapist and she said I was using it appropriately as a healthy outlet. Just to clarify that my love of games didn’t rise to the level of any sort of addiction.\n\nLast time I tried Adderall IR and now again that I am back on it I simply…don’t want to play. I have no desire to go down to the basement and power up my nice gaming PC and pick up where I left off in Doom Eternal, Elden Ring, or Witcher 3. I was really enjoying all those games and the desire to continue is just gone. It’s not really a problem, obviously, it just makes me a little sad. It sort of sucks that Adderall takes away something that brought me a little joy. It also takes away the *need* to play in order to relieve stress, but it along with that it seems to take the option away. I’ve tried to make myself play and I just find it boring.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else happens to have had this experience.",

But once I stopped playing for a longer period I can play much better than playing everyday. \n\nNot only for piano, almost for everything. That also means that if I have done something in the past without doing it for a long time I don‘t unlearn it, changing my perspective gets easier. \n\nSince I have ADHD I wonder if you experience this too and think if this is good or bad?",

I started reading abt it and i thought it made so much damn sense. And when ODD was said to be very closely linked to Adhd I thought yep this is me. BUT HOWEVER, there are a few things I don’t get/don’t have. Like hyperactivity, I’m not super energetic, and I get good grades and am very neat (I don’t listen in class I mostly doodle or sleep tho I mostly do study at home) like can I have adhd but not have those characteristics? And where do I go to get diagnosed. I have a very bad relationships with my parents and I don’t rlly talk/know how to talk abt my emotions. Pls help.\n\n(im 14F idk if it’s relevant)",
