(of course maybe the creater has named it another name, idk yet).\n\nSo we named it the mole because of the big amount of moles appearing there. (you'll understand what I mean).\n\nSo now I wanted to ask you if you want to help us solve this riddle.\n\nIn case I gonna post the link down below sou you can decide wether you want to help us or not.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Nakano-Anapa/comments/8wsfst/2036/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nakano-Anapa/comments/8wsfst/2036/)\n\nCheers,s47!(Sven)",

        "text": "Imagine, for whatever reason, you're living in a strange foreign country where nobody speaks English and they don't even seem to use gestures. You can get by just fine and there are plenty of exciting things to occupy your time, but you can't shake the feeling there's something pretty obvious that everyone else knows but you can't figure it out. The people have a lot of strange possessions, too: giant hamster balls they run around in every morning, little voodoo-doll looking things they pick up and sniff occasionally, machines that spread dust around, etc. A lot of them have dogs, but the dogs seem pretty normal: they chase the hamster balls, sniff the voodoo dolls, roll in the dust, and generally do normal dog things.\n\nSo, what's the obvious thing you're missing? Take a guess, but don't spend too much time thinking about it, because just like in real life, your world is filled with distractions that are way more fun than trying to figure out some dumb riddle.",

The game is pretty old (i think the last time it was updated was 2011) and now I'm just genuinely stuck. So Zahada is this internet riddle based game where the answer of the riddle puts you to the next question (idk how many there are but I'm currently on lvl 93)  and Iv'e been stumped on this one for a while. Here is it: \n\n93.\n\nIf autological is a word which describes itself and heterological is a word which doesn’t describe itself then heterological is neither autological or heterological as in being either it becomes the other. Therefore I propose a new word to describe heterological, and that is paradoxological. A paradoxological word is one which in attempting to describe itself subsequently fails to describe itself. However the question then arises: What type of word is paradoxological?\n\ngreatly appreciated to those who could help!\n\nand if you wanna try it our yourself, here's the [link](http://mcgov.co.uk/zahada.html)",
