        "text": "This is a story of cops coming through in an emergency.  It happened over a decade ago when I was still a teenager.  It was summer break before college and I was out watching anime and eating popcorn at my friend’s place.  The dryer beeped and he went to move the laundry into the living room with us so he could fold it while we watched Bleach. \n\nThat was when the cat tried to kill him.  Now, one of the features of this family room was a glass top coffee table and the cat decided that while my friend was walking with laundry and couldn’t see his feet a great time to trip him.  Friend falls into the coffee table and gets a giant shard of glass sticking out of his arm. There’s blood everywhere. \n\nHe didn’t live that far from the ER and we were in a panic since he was bleeding a lot and we didn’t think we had time to wait for an ambulance so friend, his boyfriend and I piled into my van and sped off down the empty road at 11 pm. \n\nThe sped might have been a miscalculation because we were about halfway there when red and blue lights lit up my rear view. \n\nFuck. \n\nSo I pull over and the cop walks over looking bored.  “License and registration?”\n\n“Emergency!”  “Aaaaaahhhhh.”  “I cant stop the bleeding!”\n\nOk so we were a little panicked and it wasn’t our finest moment.  Officer looks up from his pad, sees three blood covered teens, one with a bunch of glass sticking out of him and takes charge. \n\n“Follow me to the ER. We’ll talk there.”  And with that he ran back to his car and escorted us the rest of the way to the hospital.  \n\nI don’t remember a lot of what was said there. I know my friend wound up with some gnarly scars but I do remember the officer talking me down from panic and assuring us that we’d done fine.  He stayed with us until we were sure friend was fine and that neither of us were hurt.  \n\nSo thanks to that officer for helping us out that night. I still blame the cat. ",

        "text": "*Let me preface this by saying I was definitely in the wrong here*\n\nThis would have been about 3 years ago, and I definitely should've gotten a **HUGE** fine. Active Duty AF at the time, and had just found out that I'm deploying. In the next 2 days. Understandably, I went a bit into panic mode and headed to our local Walmart to get all the crap on the list and what not. Hopped onto the on-ramp to the highway (65 mph zone), and I wasn't even remotely paying attention to neither my speed or who I just passed. Well, needless to say it was HP out of the corner of my eye. I look down and my heart dropped at the sight of the speedo needle rolling down to 90 as I let off the gas.\n\nI didn't even wait for the Trooper to light me up and pull me over, I simply overtook him ,and pulled off onto the shoulder. (This was my first time being pulled over *period* and I knew for sure I was getting a ticket). This didn't help my anxiety about getting dropped onto a deployment 48 hours in advance but I held it together as the Trooper walked up and asked me for my info. \n\n\"Do you know how fast you were going?\"\n'Way too fast.'\n\"Nailed it there. Way too fast. 95 in a 65.\"\nI bowed my head in shame.\n\nAs we were having this conversation, I was struggling to pull up my insurance info on my phone, and that's when we he asked me to turn the vehicle off and step back to his cruiser. I thought to myself, \"This is it. I'm going to jail, I'm not going to make this deployment, and get kicked out of the military.\" My mind was going a mile a minute when I walked back to his cruiser with him. One of those new, slick, dodge chargers (always really liked those). But we split in front of the car and I tried to open the door to the back seat of his car, with a \"Might as well get this over with\" mentality. He looked over his shoulder getting into the drivers seat and said, \"Nah man, up front.\" And proceeded to get in his car as he chuckled to himself. I sighed and thought, \"Well, its a step in the right direction.\" \n\nI settled into the shotgun seat and he began running my info while simultaneously asking me \"So you had better have a pretty good reason to be going that fast.\" I began from the beginning of my story and told him the whole thing. Once I had finished, he stared at his screen for what seemed like forever and finally shut it with what I could only describe as him making up his mind on what to do with me. He handed me back my info and dropped this on me:\n\n\"Look man, given any other circumstances I would have already have a ticket with a court date on it for you, along with (X amount) of points on your license and (X amount) of dollars in fines, but you're military, I sympathize with your situation and appreciate what you do, and I refuse to scratch off a ticket that wont even show up in my system before you leave out of country.\"\n\nI swear to God my jaw hit the floor.\n\n\"So I'm gonna let you off with a very stern warning: Go get your stuff, go home, and don't touch 65 there and back. Get me?\"\n\nI was so stunned all I could do was nod my head.\nI thanked him very much and proceeded to walk to my car, where I let out what seemed to be the biggest sigh of relief in my life. I've always have had a very positive attitude towards this states particular patrol since then. Not because I dodged a **MASSIVE** hypothetical bullet, but because this particular trooper was human and understood human error. He was a big part that made up my mind to pursue being a LEO when I get out. Hats off to you sir, where ever you are.\n\nTLDR; Went too fast, didn't get a ticket due to my deploying in 2 days. ",

Unfortunately, a driver in the crash was drunk, so the other Trooper had to spend more time taking the driver to jail.\n\nI was tasked with towing the driver's car and conducting an inventory. The car was down a ravine, so I waited for the tow company to get it out before looked through it. I asked the driver, \"Is there anything in the car of value that you want to make sure I note on the inventory?\" The driver said he took out $300 in cash the night before, so he wanted to be sure he got that back.\n\nOnce the car was out of the ravine, I looked through it and couldn't find any cash. The driver's wallet was in there, and it didn't have any cash either. I tried to do a thorough inventory, because I didn't want a baseless accusation about stealing the drunk's money. Fortunately, I found a way I wouldn't be on the hook for it, and wrote it down on the tow form.\n\nThe next day, I saw the other Trooper again. He asked me about the money, asking if I booked it into property since the drunk wouldn't stop bringing it up on the ride to jail.\n\n\"There wasn't any money in there.\"\n\nHe was confused. \"No?\"\n\n\"No, but I found a receipt. It had one item on it. $300 from a tattoo shop for a tattoo from that day. I included that in the inventory. If it comes up that they try to claim we stole it, ask them when they got their last tattoo.\"\n\nIt never came up.",

Mid push-up, he put him on the phone and make him apologize for wasting everybody's time, just frantic babbling while they worked him over. Then they switched to some worse exercise, and all he could manage was panting.\n\nAfter awhile of that, the Sergeant asks me to mail the wallet, and he'll keep working on his problem child.\n\nI felt very, very grateful to be a civilian that morning.

        "text": "A domestic violence call went out tonight...  \n\nDispatch advised that the victim fled from her home after being struck by her husband.  The incident occurred at so-and-so address and the victim is now with family at so-and-so address.  \n\nA unit arrived where the victim was now located and was advised that her husband had come home from a long night of drinking at Miami Beach and had become aggressive and struck her after she inquired as to why he had come home so late.\n\nThe victim also mentioned that her husband was likely still at the scene and was with her two children.  She also advised the officer that her husband was in possession of a newly purchased handgun.\n\nOnce the officer advised dispatch of the newly found information, multiple units were dispatched in emergency mode (lights and sirens) to respond to the home and check on the well being of the husband and the children.  \n\nWhile the units were en route, another call came in of shots fired from within the apartment complex which the incident location was located.  The caller reported at least 8 shots fired.  \n\nThe first officer arriving announced that he was not hearing gun shots but would be making entry as soon as the next units arrived.  The Field Duty Lieutenant advised the units not to make entry unless the situation became an active shooter situation.  The Field Duty Lieutenant then gave orders for a perimeter to be set around the apartment complex and called for on-duty SWAT to arrive for a forced entry.  \n\n(While this may seem like poor decision making to some, our policy states that in event of an active shooter, officers will make immediate entry and neutralize the threat.  However, in the event of a hostage (or potential) situation, officers will hold a perimeter and wait for on-duty SWAT to respond.)\n\nWhile on post, my partner turned to me and said “If there were shots fired, why aren’t the kids causing some sort of commotion?”  \n\nI thought for a second before he answered his own question with “I dont think they’re still alive man”\n\nEventually rumor began to circulate that the husband must’ve killed his kids and then himself after his wife took off.\n\nI stood there with my firearm in the sul position, mortified at the thought of a murder-suicide situation.\n\nOn-duty SWAT eventually arrived and held the air (prohibited radio transmissions) while they made entry into the home.  It must have been the longest few minutes I’ve ever waited through before the SWAT team authorized the air to be re-opened.  \n\nThe SWAT officers then exited the home with the husband in handcuffs and shouted to the crowd of officers standing by “It’s QRU (okay)”.  \n\nThe crowd was visibly relieved to hear that nobody was hurt.\n\nI eventually linked up with the lead SWAT officer who informed me that although they found casings on the ground, all of the people inside were unharmed and sound asleep.  \n\nAlthough the story may seem short, this took place over the course of three hours and needless to say it was a worrisome three hours.  I’m just glad everyone turned out okay in the end.",

        "text": "My agency lets us work uniformed extra employment. A business such as a club or hospital usually wants police to supplement their on site security, and we can go work for them, in our capacity as police, for whatever price we wish to negotiate. We do these jobs essentially as contractors, where our pay and taxes are done separately from our main job, being the police.\n\nWhen you think about it, an extra job (EJ) paying $35/hour to stand around and keep the peace seems like insane easy money, until you remember that the reason EJs pay more than your regular job is because most of what your main job compensates you with is in the form of health care and retirement. It's easy to get caught in this trap where you see $35 an hour, and start to think that maybe you really don't need sleep that badly, and your family would love to try skiing, and there's a nice new car your wife has been talking about etc. It's easy to forget that every hour you do EJs is an hour less sleep and family time you get, for an amount of money that isn't really as good as your main job gives you with benefits considered. Night shift is especially vulnerable, because you're not sleeping much anyway, but this is not a reason to work yourself harder.\n\nAnyway, before I realized these things and eased off the EJs, I was working my real job all night and doing EJs all day. Two to three hours sleep was the norm during my work week. Having only worked part time jobs before the Sheriff's Office, I was receiving more money than I thought existed in the world. It really wasn't much, but in my mind disposable income was a new and wondrous thing and I loved it.\n\nI had been working an EJ for 12 hours one day in January then went to do my real job at 10PM that night, to keep working until 6AM. I love coffee and at the time I was still drinking energy drinks. All this caffeine, combined with sheer liquid volume of all my efforts to stay alert, had resulted in a plumbing crisis lasting basically the entire night. Hey, having to pee is just another thing that helps keep you awake, right?\n\nI was making my way to the gas station to make yet another use of their bathroom when I heard the call: \"I've got one on the ground!\" This is our odd way of saying, I have a suspect fleeing on foot. I was pretty close. With such a full bladder and heavy belt, I didn't think I'd be much use in a foot chase. However, the deputy who called it out was a rookie, and his call was a disturbance in an apartment complex.\n\nConsiderations:\n1. The rookie will always chase no matter the circumstances, like a dog after a tennis ball.\n2. Disturbance in an apartment complex = the crook is probably home, or near his home, and has access to whatever weapons he may own, to include his car.\n3. The crook may have several friends and associates within walking distance.\n4. Apartment complexes kill a lot of pursuing deputies, their very design makes it ludicrously easy to set an ambush for someone chasing right behind you.\n\nAt this point, I was so full of readily available water that I was more suited to fight fire than crime. I felt like I could have single-streamedly pissed out a gas fire. However, the rookie was in a bad situation, and probably didn't realize it yet. I had to go.\n\nIt was a freezing cold, crystal clear night, and a helicopter was available. A police helicopter usually has two men on board, one to fly, and one to operate the instrumentation, including a forward-looking infrared camera. In cold, clear weather, no one in the open or even under tree cover can hide from the FLIR. The deputy chasing the crook lost him, and we formed a perimeter along where he had last been seen. I found myself alone, covering a corner on an apartment building right next to the woods, with no dividing fence. The helicopter was making wide circles above, searching for the crook with FLIR.\n\nAt this point, my eyeballs were floating, and I (correctly) assumed the crook had simply made a loop and gone home before the helicopter arrived.\n\nIt was like a stealth videogame: the helicopter was making a slow, regular, predictable circle overhead, giving me about 40 seconds in between passes where it couldn't see me for the buildings. I had to strike fast, and my timing had to be impeccable. It was time for dynamic diuresis.\n\nI moved towards the tree line and peered into the woods, then as soon as the helicopter was occluded, down came my zipper. The sensation of almost painful relief formed a symphony with the shockingly loud stream of piss. It kept flowing, and flowing, and flowing, until to my horror I saw my time was almost up, the helicopter was coming back around. I strained mightily to finish, making my own personal stealth Niagara, until finally, with seconds to spare, I finished, zipped up, and scrambled to the building corner.\n\nWhew. Relief and mission accomplished. Until the FLIR operator keyed up above me: \"Unit on the northwest side of the complex, we have a heat signature to your north, about thirty feet, in the treeline.\"\n\nI wheeled around and faced north, sweeping the area, seeing no threats... and one still-steaming puddle of piss.\n\n\"It's dissipating, probably an animal.\" came the helicopter's report.\n\n\"Probably,\" I murmured. I'm not even sure if I keyed up the radio before I spoke.\n\nLater we caught the crook, who confirmed during interview that sure enough, he doubled back on the deputy, went home, and was playing Xbox while the helicopter circled overhead. That night, two people narrowly evaded getting caught by the all-seeing eye of the helicopter.\n\nTL;DR I pissed in the woods and almost got caught by a search helicopter.",

        "text": "I was a very broke junior in college, paying my way through school, frequently finding myself torn between getting some gas in the car, eating, and buying some booze. I was often drunk, hungry, and having to walk. Not always, however.\n\nThis particular evening I was driving (with plenty of gas) home from a long shift at the local place of my employment at the time. I was just about to turn onto my street when the red and blues lit up my rear view. Now, I'm a relatively responsible driver with about 4 traffic tickets in my almost 30 years of life. Thankfully, my interaction with police growing up was mostly positive (ride-alongs, PAL program, friends, family, etc.), and I was fairly well educated on legal matters, including traffic law, at the time. I wasn't nervous and was absolutely certain I had done nothing wrong on that drive home.\n\n\"Good evening, sir. My name is Officer Mike with the local PD, I pulled you over because I noticed your left headlight was out.\"\n\n\"sh*t\"\n\nLuckily, Officer Mike was just pulling me over to make me aware of the situation, and I'm glad he did because I had no clue. My car was old. My headlights were such trash, I never noticed the visibility difference whenever the left one went out. He suggested I fix it as to avoid future run ins with the PD on a slow night, and sent me on my way.\n\nSix months. Six months came and went before my 23 year old, Natty Ice infused brain remembered \"oh dude, my headlight.\" Not only did I remember, but on that day I took action! I got off work, hit the local store that sold left headlight replacement bulbs, coughed up half my paycheck for the replacements, called my friend to tell him I was on my way over to use his tools and his beer, and off I went! \n\nI remember feeling so proud at that moment. It was me and my newly purchased headlight bulbs riding shotgun, on our way to Friend With Tools and Beer's house to set things right in the world. To make the streets of College City safer than they were the day prior. Officer Mike and maybe even Mom would be so prou... Red and blue lights filled my car. Six months. Six whole months went by not only without any thought of that headlight, but without any unwanted attention from the cops because of it. Whatever. Odd and unlikely, but whatever. Assuming that was the reason for the stop, the proof of my intent to remedy the issue was sitting in my passenger seat, so I was not nervous. And was absolutely certain I'd be sent on my way once again without a ticket.\n\n\"Good evening, sir. My name is Officer Mike with the local PD, I pulled you over because I noticed your left headlight was out.\"\n\n\"No f***ing way.\"\n\nOfficer Mike with the local PD re-spawned on the same street he pulled me over six months prior, for the same reason, but this time while I was on my way to get the issue resolved! This wasn't a small town with a handful of cops. It was a decent sized city with multiple departments to handle the huge college population. The odds felt so slim. The universe must be having a good laugh. I showed him the headlight replacements and receipt showing I had just made the purchase and was on my way to swap them out. Officer Mike was a good sport, we laughed at the irony, and he let me be on my way. But not before citing me for my insurance that had expired two days prior. Of course.\n\nAfter the stop, I continued on to Friend With Beer's house. Yeah, he also had tools but at this point, who cares? I called him to let him know I was near, and to tell him about the ridiculous stop that had just occurred, six months in the making. I pull onto his street, I see his house at the end of the block and him standing out front, phone to his ear as we're still laughing about the whole thing when... Yup. Red and blues lit up what seemed to be the whole damn neighborhood. I look around in disbelief, Friend With Beer now laughing maniacally in my ear, his head thrown back and hand on his belly in the distant.\n\n\"Good evening, sir. Are you aware your headlight is out?\"\n\n\nTL;DR: I was pulled over for a blown out headlight. I managed to go just over six months without fixing it or getting pulled over for it again. On the very day I bought the headlight replacements, I got pulled over on the same exact street, by the same exact cop, for the same reason, while en route to a friend's house to correct the issue. Though we laugh about it, turned out my insurance had expired 2 days prior so I got cited for that. Shortly after that stop, I got pulled over AGAIN for the headlight half a block away from my friend's place. ",

After a quite busy evening of ambulance work and putting out a guys burning deck after his BBQ \"malfunctioned\" (that's a different story) we had a chance to rest and hit the mattress and catch up on Pinterest or play clash Royale or whatever it is we are supposed to do when not responding to calls.  (Personally, after hours, I sleep) anyway, none of this was to be.   \nPagers go off, radio goes nuts and everybody gets up, shuffles, or in my case, falls out of bed.  Something about a 1 car collision on the side of the road.   Probably a quick check to confirm unoccupied and engine cold and let the stateys do the rest.  \n\n\nYea, well.  Kinda.\n\nJump in ambulance, cue the music for a short trip (because it's cool) and arrive.\nOur story begins with a bewildered ambulance crew who arrive first to find....nothing on the side of the road.   It's worth mentioning that this road is the main highway that goes down the valley as it goes through town.  As we we're headed down it, the incident was on our right just at a small left hand bend in the road.   There's an open spot where the incident supposedly is.   About 50 feet back from the road is the local liquor store.   \n\n\nYou can see where this might be headed.  \n\nShortly after arriving I realized there was a stump where a street light should have been.  Realizing that the light was at the bend, slowly I turned around, turned on my helmet flashlight and looked down the sorta half alley that lead to the liquor store.  And there, perched like some strange, demonic bird looking back at me, was the taillights to a BMW, halfway through the big front window of the liquor store with it's front wheels resting on the stores front counter.  It was so odd that i kinda stopped for a second before remembering why I was there.\n\n\n\nSo strangely enough, although the car caused a massive amount of damage, the front door was fully functional.  We went through it, inside to check out the driver.   Only there was no driver to be found.   No blood or anything that would clue us as to where they'd gone.  And nobody around, a passing driver had called it in.  So we walk back outside, trooper is outside running the plate hears we got nada and calls for his homies to set up a search.   \n\n-5 minutes later- \n\nI am standing at the scene making sure nobody deduced that because the wall was busted at the liquor store, that booze was now free tonight.  I hear awkward sluggish footsteps behind me and turn to see an empty Shell of a 50s year old lady walking to me as if the world was all uphill.  Realizing this might be my driver, I called my partner over who brought the sheriff deputy for fun and we tend to her.  \n\n\n\"Hi ma'am, I'm themedicduck with town fire.  Are you hurt?\n\n\"I wasn't driving\"\n\n\"Ok but are you hurt?\"\n\n\"I. Was. Not. Driving.\"\n\n\"Gotcha.  What are you doing out this early in the morning?

        "text": "It was early morning hours in a big city on the weekend. That meant traffic was pretty sparse, but also moving quite quickly. Everyone in the city takes advantage of the open road when there's no traffic.\n\nI was called to a disabled motorist on the shoulder of the freeway. I found her on an elevated transition road between freeways, and we were probably around 100 feet off the ground.  The shoulder we were on was barely wide enough to get her out of the lanes. Whatever was wrong with her car wasn't going to be fixed here, and we needed a tow truck.\n\nI spoke with the driver, who told me she was a bit scared given where she was. I found that to be completely reasonable. She told me she tried to call AAA, but because she was on a transition road, a state tow truck had to tow her off, which could then hand her off to AAA. It was something to do with state contracts. She had tried calling AAA, who referred her to us, and that's why I was there. I worked this same beat almost daily for years, so I was aware of how it worked.\n\nI had my dispatch contact the tow truck dispatcher. The tow truck dispatcher said they only had one truck working (when they usually have four) and they wouldn't be able to respond, so AAA could come out directly. My dispatcher then contacted AAA, who sent out a truck. As you may have begun to realize, this is not the best system.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of sitting in a rather dangerous spot as traffic flew by us, my dispatcher gave me an update on AAA. The only way to get to where we were was to go through a toll. The AAA driver was at the toll both and didn't bring money to pay for the toll since he normally isn't allowed to tow cars from where we were, and normally didn't have to go through the toll. I asked my dispatch to relay to the toll workers that he was being dispatched by me to help me, and it was okay to let him through.\n\nThe toll plaza supervisor refused. They said the driver was being rude. I just about lost my shit.\n\nI couldn't leave and force them to open it because my emergency lights and flares were likely the thing keeping this person from getting hit. I relayed to my dispatch that I was unaware that the toll workers had more authority than the State Troopers, and I directed them to give a lawful order from me to let the driver through. The toll workers still refused.\n\nAAA cancelled the original truck and started a different one from a different location. The new one was able to use a different route that bypassed the toll. Roughly an hour and a half after my original arrival, we were on our way. I went straight to one of my sergeants.\n\n\"How do I file a formal complaint against a state employee?\"\n\n\"What kind of employee?\"\n\n\"A toll plaza employee.\"\n\n\"Oh...you don't.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"We tried to do that a few years ago and found out that you can't really do that. It was a big thing, going through a bunch of different channels, and after a ton of work it never went anywhere. Soo.....we don't do that anymore.\"\n\n\"...got it.\"\n\nWhen I first started working that beat, I heard a story from a more senior Trooper about not taking the toll worker's side. We would occasionally be called to help break up an argument between a toll worker and a motorist. I would think that the motorist would be the aggressor since the toll worker wants to keep their job. The senior Trooper said he saw too many cases where the toll worker was the instigator.\n\nI continued to work that beat, but I got a lot less helpful to the toll workers.",

        "text": "Second edition of the Patrol Anthology \n\nTyping this on mobile so it won’t be as formatted as the last but I’ve got 45 minutes to kill so without further ado, lets get going!\n\nThe Message\n\nOur in car computers have the ability to send text messages between users and dispatch. We usually use it to talk back and forth about important work topics such as where we are getting food and such. We also occasionally use it to notify each other of possible incidents in our area. \n\nSo I get a message from the beat car next to mine that asks if I could go to a certain intersection. I figured there was a disabled car on the shoulder or something near there that they wanted me to check on. No big deal. \n\nAs I approached the intersection, I see two vehicles on the left shoulder(it is a one way, three lane road) a police car and another vehicle on the right. There is a large traffic pole laying in the “fast” lane of the road. \n\nI pulled behind the vehicles on the left shoulder since there was a police car with the other. They both said they ran over pole but couldn’t find any damage. Both vehicles left so I pulled to the right shoulder and made contact with the other driver. \n\nHe stated he ran over the pole as well and it had damaged his oil pan. That was obvious to me as well due to the trail of oil behind the car. I started him a tow truck and took down the information I needed for his accident report. \n\nI walk back to talk to the officer who messaged me to ask why she didn’t just call out and ask me to respond. I discovered her car had damage on the front driver side headlight. \n\nI asked her what happened and she said that she had hit the pole. I asked her if she saw who hit it or if she just came across it. She said, “No. I hit the pole. “ \n\nShe had been making a U-Turn and took the turn too sharp, making contact with the pole and knocking it into the roadway, causing the other accident. \n\nSo I took down the needed information for a department accident and suddenly I had two accident reports to write. \n\nWhile I was in the middle of writing them, I got a message seeing if I wanted to grab food at a local diner as repayment. I respectfully declined, because I was still writing the reports. \n\n\n\nThe Backwards Driver\n\nOne night, I was sitting in one of my spots that had a view of the nearby interstate. Usually I am not in a good position to do anything about violations I notice but send messages to another officer who is further down the road. \n\nThis night I see a semi truck and a passenger car pass each other going opposite ways, which isn’t unusual. Until I realized the passenger car disappeared behind the semi truck, which meant it was going the wrong way on the interstate. \n\nI was able to make it to the entrance of the interstate where this car was headed and watched as it backed down the ramp. \n\nI pulled the vehicle over for obvious reasons. When I walked up to the driver window, the driver held up his index finger in my face while he manipulated a cell phone mounted on a hands free holder. He was pulling up his camera. While I have no problem with being recorded, I was a little put off by the way he did this. \n\nI waited patiently until he turned and faced me. I asked for his drivers license and insurance. The driver looked at me in anger, threw his hands out then pointed to his ear. I noticed a hearing aid so I spoke slower, thinking I had not spoken loud enough or slow enough since he was apparently hearing impaired. I repeated my request, making sure to articulate my words clearly. \n\nAgain I was met with the throwing of the arms followed by the pointing to the ear. \n\nAt this point, I pulled out my notebook and wrote my request. The driver read the note and produced the requested information. He then wrote “I’m going to call your supervisor about you needing more training in communicating with the deaf. “ \n\nI replied with an okay, I will be back in a few minutes , as I hadn’t yet returned to my car to run the guy thru our systems. \n\nHe wrote back, “ No ticket tonight right?”\n\nI just rewrote I would be back. Now I usually give breaks. The only times I don’t are when the violation causes or could easily cause an accident or if people ask for a break. \n\nI returned a few minutes later with the gentleman’s citation for driving the wrong way on the interstate, provided him with all the instructions I usually provide, and I provided him with my identifying information as well as my direct supervisor’s information and a number to contact him at. \n\nThe gentleman was obviously upset but didn’t try to argue any further. \n\nI went and met up with my supervisor right after the incident. Here he bestowed upon me wisdom only supervisor’s have: “I don’t think he will be calling. How will he hear what I have to say” \n\n\n\nThe Fugitive \n\nOne day, we were over staffed and had several cars with two officers in them. Usually we have 2-4 officers in this area, this day there were 8. \n\nWe had been looking for a subject who was wanted for felony probation violation. We received a call that he was walking around one of our residential areas. \n\nWe all arrive in the area and almost immediately I see an officer run towards the back of a house. I run to the other corner of the house as he is calling out his location and foot pursuit. I run into the backyard and he has our suspect at Taser point. \n\nAs we are cuffing him, the other six officers come out of the woodworks. We had the guy completely surrounded with eight officers. \n\nThe guy was just as surprised as I was entertained by the sight. He said, “ you guys riding a little heavy today huh?”\n\nI just replied, “ you just picked a bad day to be out and about. “\n\n\n\nThe End.... for now. \n\nHope you guys enjoyed. My phone is almost dead now and I don’t have any more time to write At he moment. There will be a part three coming out soon. I won’t try to cause such a gap between this one and the next. \n\nDrive safe!",

        "text": "Howdy again, lads and lasses. I just recently posted a story about someone important to me, but seeing the reaction I wanted to drop a story that would deliver chuckles rather than tears. One again, sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nA bit of background, I'm a semi-experienced security officer with a rather large amount of diversity in my word for someone of 3 years security experience, everything from guarding mine shafts to basically being a receptionist and for the one important for this story, a chemical plant. Simple job, sit in a shack, control the gate, report everything, mind the ghostly apparitions that desire your soul. At least, that's the job description according to a guy I shall dub Crazy Steve (CS) for this.\n\nCS was the annoying coworker in every possible regard. That one guy you know who doesn't understand the internet but wants you to look up 70s songs for him to listen to off your phone constantly (Especially Manfred Mann's Earth Band), the one who sleeps or hides in a corner where he thinks you can't smell his urine/weed, and the one who uses every last bit of coffee and never contributes to the coffee fund. On top of all of this, he was absolutely certain the site was a haunting ground for ghosts, demons, and aliens. I have several stories surrounding the downright strange things I've seen him do, but this came after his termination from threatening to cast a death curse on our boss over the phone to a poor, innocent truck driver just trying to get through the gate.\n\nNeedless to say, things went south for CS very fast, and not even a week has passed since his unwilling departure before we all receive a notice to be on lookout due to sightings of him trespassing on property and attempting to urinate in the bleach the plant was producing. \n\nMy shift was about halfway over when CS decides to show up, banging away on the gate and shouting for me to let him in. Being the nice guy I am, I decide to make him aware I would call the police if he did not leave before actually doing so, for which the only response I received was, \"You have to let me in...please...they're here, whispering, they're all around me!\" After several minutes of insane rambling with no real content, just more of the same, I tell him I'll check around for spirits, which I do to ensure there's no animals around that are the source of his concern, in order to dial the police.\n\nCS and I wait around for barely five minutes before a single car pulls up, and I will never forget this for all of my days. A young fellow who seems very new and unsure about himself strolls up to ask what the problem is, after conversing with me over the phone about the issue as policy demands for that particular site. CS explains the situation in something that went sort of like this.\n\nCS: \"Officer, thank god you're here! I'm being called here, sought out, you have to help! I've worked here for years and I know them well, they're angry, furious, I'm not here to quell them and the young guard here is in serious danger! He won't last long if I don't help him!\"\n\nI'm standing nearby, snickering, with the cop shooting me strange glances.\n\nOfficer: \"Is there someone out here trying to hurt you? What kind of danger are you on about?\"\n\nCS: \"They're coming! They're coming because the charms are wearing off, I have to get inside, the spirits from beyond are coming to reclaim their grave site! We're on an Indian burial ground, sir, and I must get inside to protect us before their fury is unleashed!\"\n\nAt this point, the look of absolute shock is apparent on the officer's face, a look I can only describe as half shock and half suspicion that he's being filmed. After glancing at me for a reassuring nod that CS is, in fact, serious, the officer tries to take control of the situation.\n\nOfficer: \"Alright sir, calm down, it's alright, you're not allowed into the facility but I assure you everything will be fine. Why don't you come with me and we'll get you taken care of, and then I can come back and look for your...spirits.\"\n\nCS immediately realized what was going on, and the gears in his head were visibly turning as he thought this over for a few seconds. Rather than leave or calm down, he decided the best way to handle the situation was to double down. He began to claw at the gate, gurgling and pulling on it while rolling his eyes back in his head. As I'd never seen him or anyone act this way, I was a little taken aback, but the officer stayed calm as CS slurred out in his best impression of a ghost, \"They've come, they're here, a possession by a Spirit From Beyond! I must get in, I must, before this evil creature takes me, for your sake and his you must let me in!\"\n\nThe act was rather bad, but just stunning in how desperately he tried to play it. The cop was very obviously trying to stifle a laugh, I decided to light up a cigar to busy myself with as the performance was both hard not to laugh at and just very embarrassing. After a moment, CS just stopped, looked between us, and his shoulders and head fell.\n\nCS: \"I'm sorry, guys, I just didn't want to embarrass myself after all that, I'm not really possessed, I'm sorry if I fooled you...I just wanted to help.\" \n\nAt this point, I was forced to make an excuse of needing to go on patrol so I could lose it out of earshot. When I got back, the officer was waiting at my shack with CS handcuffed in the back of his cruiser. Apparently, after I left, CS took the chance to try and dart past the officer to a tear in the fence none of us knew about, got stuck halfway in, and was arrested. Probably occurring while I was checking the shipping dock inside one of the buildings, as I hadn't heard it. I gave my statement to the officer, mostly things like, \"Yes, he has always believed in things like this. No, this isn't anything completely new, although the possession was.\"\n\nRight then, the officer broke character for just a moment, leaned over, and said, \"Between you and me, for half a second, I really believed he was an escapee from an insane asylum.\" A few chuckles from me, a couple more questions answered, and a very bewildered officer drove off and I was left with a very large amount of paperwork and a difficult job of figuring out how to put it all down describing the situation within company guidelines.\n\nAftermath: I've met the cop once more after this, shortly after I left my job at the chemical plant. CS was to have a psyche evaluation and his security license voided, as well as some fines and a few days of watch in a hospital. Apparently, the story had his entire department giggling for days. This was a couple months after the event, but they were still warning him to beware spirits from beyond for nearly every call. He got some free food out of it though for such a good story, so it was fine with him. \n\nQuick Note: Aside from smoking weed, CS apparently had a very active lifestyle of drug abuse in the past, but was entirely clean around the time of this event. He was just flat out crazy, rather than high as I assumed. Never found out what happened after everything was said and done, but every now and then I put on Manfred Mann's cover of Spirit in the Night and try to put myself in his shoes, just for fun to try and see the world how he did. I am heavily convinced I can never achieve this without acid.\n\nOh and no, the chemical plant was not on an Indian burial site nor was there one anywhere near the town where this occurred. He was very thoroughly convinced otherwise, however. I'd only heard about it seventeen times during our shared hours. ",

        "text": "I was working on a busy freeway between rush hours. There were roughly 8 lanes for traffic (for just one direction) with traffic easily hitting 65mph, so it was dangerous to be on the freeway if you weren't in a car. It was also illegal due to the aforementioned traffic. Logically, I came across a bicyclist. \n\nIn his defense, he was riding on the shoulder, and hadn't gotten to the main freeway yet. We have a few standard ways to stop people, the typical being the flashing lights. This bicyclist didn't have mirrors, so that wouldn't work. There's also the siren, but they're incredibly loud and I didn't want to unnecessarily harm his hearing. There's also the megaphone on the car, so I chose that option as the least disruptive. I clicked the mic twice as a sort of heads up, which the bicyclist seemed to ignore or not hear. I finally spoke into it, \"Stop. Stop.\" He stopped, turned around, and saw me. I got out to talk with him.\n\nIt's not that rare to find people riding a bike or walking in this stretch of the freeway. They're typically homeless, and they're trying to get from one nearby city to another. When that's the case, I'll warn them about the danger and give them a ride to where they're going.\n\nThis gentleman was not homeless. He was a hipster, which is way worse.\n\n\"Good afternoon. Where are you headed?\"\n\n\"I'm going to the bike path.\" That wasn't the reply I was expecting.\n\n\"The...bike path? The one over there?\" I pointed to the other side of the freeway.\n\n\"The sign pointed this way so that's the way I'm going.\"\n\n\"Which sign?\"\n\n\"The sign at the on-ramp.\"\n\nMy skepticism started to leak. \"There's a sign at an on-ramp to the freeway saying bicycles should get on the freeway?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"No. You have to go back the way you came. The bike path entrance is under the freeway, by the Aldi's.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it be dangerous to ride against traffic?\" Really? THAT'S the unsafe thing here? As you're about to get on an eight-lane freeway?\n\n\"There's practically no traffic yet, you're not on the main stretch of freeway, and you can't keep going because it's another few miles of pure freeway.\" And I didn't have a bicycle rack on my car, so while I could transport *him*, I couldn't transport his bike.\n\n\"Okay, I guess I'll go back. And I'd like to say something.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I don't know if it's your training or standard protocol or whatever, but the way you stopped me was terrible. Like with the microphone? I mean that was really startling. I feel like it could be done better.\"\n\nI considered a few options, and thought I chose the less startling, but I'm open to new ideas. A lot of the job is learning while doing.\n\n\"Okay, what would you suggest I do differently?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, but not that.\" Criticism without a solution, par for the course with being a cop.\n\n\"I'll take that under advisement.\"\n\nHe pedaled back the way he came. I then circled back to the on-ramp to be sure there weren't any secret signs telling bicyclists to get on the freeway. There were not. There was one that specifically prohibited pedestrians, mopeds, and bicyclists.",

        "text": "So let me start by saying I'm not really experienced with Reddit, although I spend a lot of time reading things here and on security pages. So please forgive the very poor formatting or errors, I'll take any advice. I don't know if this story is meant to be here as it surrounds a retired officer, not something they did while on the force, but I hope it's fine.\n\n\nTo keep introductions short, roughly 10 years ago I was a very stupid 14 year old that needed money and was going down the wrong path. I made a friend in alternative schooling who convinced me to do make very poor decisions, nothing extreme but still misdemeanor crimes.\n\n\nOne day I was delivering something I was told not to open from my friend's dad to his business partner. I got $20 and didn't care to think what it was or be smart enough to understand what I was doing. It was a long walk across town and the package was kind of heavy, so I was trying to take the shortest route possible, which meant crossing through private property, opting to ignore the No Trespassing sign. \n\n\nThe area was a mostly finished construction site for an apartment complex, still kind of littered with nasty stuff here and there. I dawdled a little bit and looked around out of curiosity. Didn't find any easily acquired treasure, but I did find a homeless man. I never actually knew any other homeless in my town, they weren't a common thing at all at the time. I talked for a minute before finding out he was hungry and had no money. Upset about his situation, I gave him my $20 from the last thing I did, talking a moment longer before turning around...to find an officer with his flashlight pointed at me.\n\n\nOfficer Rob, we'll call him, was a family friend who knew my mother. She would clean for Jim, a retired officer and Rob's father, from time to time. Given that I was trespassing, I knew I'd get an earful, but I also had a delivery to make so I made the very stupid decision of running. Needless to say I was caught quickly and my attempt to run made me even more suspicious, a search revealed drug paraphernalia in the box I was carrying. I was getting chewed out and yelled at when Steve the Homeless Man walked over and talked to Rob for a moment, apparently telling him what I did and to take it easy on me. I'll never be sure why but Rob decided not to report me, just took the box and did...whatever you would do upon finding something like that on the ground. \n\n\nI didn't get off easy though, I ended up in front of Rob, Jim - Think hardcore mobster type but in the police and a fondness for his fedora - and my mother with the situation out in the open. Probably hours of lectures, threats, crying, so on. Then Jim decided to speak up, saying he would handle it. I would basically go on \"Probation.\" For a year, I would help him with anything he needed, basically being a prisoner he could come and pick up whenever he needed something done. My mother agreed and I was trapped.\n\n\nI could talk for weeks about everything that happened in those years. Fights, definitely, at first. Things were extremely hard, I didn't get out easy. From landscaping to laying bricks for his new firepit to helping remodel his home. Hard work nearly every day whenever these tasks would come up until the time when they were finished, whereupon a new task would be found nearly immediately. Once I stopped misbehaving, Jim took me out to eat nearly every day, stopping at local landmarks and teaching me about the state I was from, which is one full of a ridiculous amount of history and naturally beautiful locations.\n\n\nEventually, the year passed, I was free, but it never stopped. Work on whatever was needed, go out to historic sites, eat good food. Jim looked after me in place of the father I never had. Two years in, I was 16 and had become a respectable person, helping my community, on the right track. I had a real life for the first time, acting like an adult and dreaming of becoming an officer like Jim's entire family basically was. Then I got the news he had passed away.\n\n\nHe never told me, I never thought to ask, but Jim was very old and apparently fighting cancer. I found out when my mother stopped me when I was about to walk to his home. Never once had it really been mentioned before, he spent all his time with me teaching me what being a man was, how to live with honor and decency, about doing the right thing and shining. He always wanted me to shine. I can't stress hard enough how much time he spent doing nothing but take this spoiled, stupid child and teaching him that there was good in him. He left me a package behind from his death, $20, his black striped fedora, and a letter telling me for one last time how he wanted me to shine. For the first time as well, I heard how important I had been to him. How he was happy to spend the last years of his life helping someone he truly believed in. The $20 was there because I gave the homeless man, a dear friend of his who convinced him and his son that I had so much good inside of me, my only bit of money so he could eat.\n\n\nJim spent the last two years of his life working with me. From working hard daily to exploring caves to history lessons in front of old cannons. All the way to the point where he could hardly walk anymore, but still stubborn enough to drive and continue teaching me from the car. I can not and will not ever be able to describe to someone how it feels to have someone you don't even know give up the last of their life to give a stupid child on the path to becoming a criminal a second chance. An officer way past his prime and retired, setting one last criminal right. \n\n\nEach and every one of you officers out there, I want to thank you for what you do. For the trouble you go through, for the pain your work causes at times, for every miserable second you struggle through your work to do some good, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I've seen how hard your work is from an outsider's perspective, how deeply it affects those who've lived your life and done your work. Thanks to one of yours, a criminal was reformed and while I never did become a LEO, I do spend much of my time helping kids who are on that wrong path to get right again, as Jim did with me. I thank you for being the best and for putting yourselves out there on a job where more people tend to hate you than be glad for you. Thank you for everything you do. I know this was long, but I hope it serves to show that lives do change thanks to you, even the ones who can't do the job anymore. Thank you.\n\nOne good deed saved my life and introduced me to the best officer I have ever known. I hope some good deed for any of you gives you the same happiness.",

        "text": "So I posted a story on r/idontworkherelady and they told me you guys might get a kick out of it.\n\nI read a story on r/idontworkherelady a month back about a person who drives a retired Police Interceptor. See, I also drive one too. Black and White with a push bar and the spotlight. But no emblems or anything, scratched up paint everywhere. Im saving up to get it repainted so I dont intend to appear like I'm law enforcement. \n\nOne day, I'm sitting around in my car in the back of a parking lot of a business, out of sight and out of mind, munching on a Subway sandwich minding my own business. I'm so enthralled in my sandwich when I hear a sharp rapping on my window. I look up mid bite at an older lady, who matches those \"I want to talk to your manager\" memes to a T. I roll down my window and ask how I can help her.\n\nCrazy Lady: Oh you finally managed to come out here and make your presence known? I've been complaining to the police for weeks about the homeless who hang out in the area around our businesses. Look there's one right there. (Proceeds to point at a guy who is well away from anything just sitting there doing nothing out of the way)\n\nMe: Ma'am, I'm sorry there's a mistake, I'm not a cop, this is just a retired cruiser. If you want me to go somewhere else, I don't mind. \n\nCL: What I want you to do is stop lying to me, get off your ass and go tell that homeless to leave. \n\nMe: First of all, don't fucking talk to me like that. I've been nothing but courteous to you and honest. I'm not a cop. I would suggest calling the non-emergency line for the local PD. \n\nCL: I pay your salary asshole! You have no right to talk to me like that! So unprofessional!\n\nSo I promptly roll up my window  which is super tinted and go back to eating my sandwich and turn the radio up. \n\nNext thing you know, a few minutes later, I get a few cops roll up with lights and sirens, surround my car and tell me to get out of the car. I promptly comply, they search me, let me go and start talking to me. They said they got a call that someone was impersonating an officer and was still parked here. \n\nAn important thing to note is that I do monthly ride alongs with this PD for a few years now so I'm a little acquainted with most of the officers. Luckily, one of them who showed up as backup, knew me, knew what I drove and knew that it's not something I'd ever do as I've shown them nothing but respect from my rides with them. \n\nFast forward a few minutes, they talk to the homeless guy who confirms that I've done nothing but sit there and eat my sandwich in peace. \n\nThey turn to the lady and start lecturing her on lying like that, how it could have turned into a dangerous situation for me, how she's trying up emergency resources on this. She doesn't like this and gets mouthy with the officers. Cue some more \"I pay your salary, I want a supervisor etc\". Supervisor comes down, and is actually a Sergeant I'm friends with whose been pushing me to test and join the PD. Really nice guy, really good at his job and deescalating any situation. She starts shouting at him and ends up poking him in the chest with her fingers. He tells her to not ever do that again that she's lucky she's not already arrested. She proceeds to tell him to fuck off and shoves him. Next thing you know, she's in cuffs, slapped with a bunch of charges and crying in tears in the back of a patrol car. \n\nSergeant walks up to me and tells me what happens and that the PD is gonna press charges. Cue all of us laughing at the situation and they leave. I walk up to the homeless guy who basically told them the truth about what happened, ask him if he's hungry to which he says yes. Buy him a sandwich from the subway next door, he thanks me, I thank him and I continue on my way. \n\nThis is basically what solidified the idea that I need to repaint my car.\n\nThanks for reading guys.\n\nPics of said car: https://imgur.com/7JNbWaU",

        "text": "Hey guys! It has been awhile since I last posted a story onto here. I really haven't had anything majorly story-worthy happen so instead I figured I would type out some of the things I have encountered or done recently. Some will be really short, others probably medium-length. I hope you enjoy!\n\n**The Honest Thief**\n\nI received a call at one of the local gas stations about a man who had tried to steal alcohol (I know, crime of the century). The reporting party told dispatch the suspect was still on scene. I arrive in my 5 minute response time and sure enough, a guy matching the description was waiting just inside the gas station. I had an assist officer with me, so I had him watch the guy while I talked to the clerk. \n\nThe clerk told me the guy had came in and bought some alcohol and left. About 20 minutes later, the guy came back and said he had dropped the bottle on the ground outside and wondered if he could get it replaced. The clerk told the guy he could not. The guy grabbed a new bottle of alcohol, and the clerk watched as he placed it into his pants. The guy then purchased a bag of chips and began to leave. The clerk confronted the guy and the guy apologized and gave the bottle back to the clerk. I spoke with the guy, who was very intoxicated by my observations, and he told me the exact same story. \n\nI was shocked at how upfront and honest this guy was. I issued him a citation for stealing(holds about the same weight as a traffic citation) and asked how he got here. He pointed to the vehicle out front and said his buddy drove him here. Inside the vehicle was his buddy, who had been drinking as well. I told him and his buddy they needed to walk home. The buddy agreed since it wasn't very far away, and away they walked.\n\n**Wrong Place, Wrong Time, Wrong Move**\n\nSo the same night as the story above, I got a call for a mailbox down in a neighborhood. This was about 30 minutes after I finished the call above. I get to the neighborhood and who do I see standing on the street? Buddy from the story above. I get out of the car to speak with him and he takes off running, well, as fast as he could run anyway with the amount of alcohol he had been drinking. He runs behind a house, then back to the front, and makes it inside. Keep in mind, every time he turned a corner I had to slow down and take it wide just in case he was waiting for me on the other side. I walk to the back patio door and discover the blinds are wide open and Buddy is sitting on the couch. I command him to come outside, which to my surprise, he complies and comes out. \n\nI place him in handcuffs and began asking him why he ran. He told me he was spooked since he had seen me at the gas station earlier. I had another officer go by the gas station to see if Buddy's car was still there. My thinking was he waited a little before going back and trying to drive home, hitting several (the count was ten) mailboxes on the way home. His car was still at the gas station so instead of wasting anymore time with him, I let him go and began investigating the downed mailboxes.\n\n**The Car Key Scuffle**\n\nThis story is unique in the fact that I was working an afternoon shift instead of my usual midnight shift. I received a call for a larceny that had just occurred out front of another gas station. The vicitm's significant other had \"stolen\" the key to the car after an argument and walked off.\n\nI arrived and she pointed me in the direction he had went. I drove down the road and I could see him talking on the phone while walking along the train tracks. He began to make his was up onto the median of a major roadway as I was exiting my car. At this point, I don't think he knew I was there. I followed him up onto the median and confronted him. I commanded him to stop, which he did, and turn around, which he did. \n\nI told him to come talk to me about what was going on. He yelled back, \"No. Why don't you come to me.\" Now for those who aren't in the business, that is not how things work, especially when I haven't been able to search you for weapons. I told him I was not walking over to him because I did not know who he was or what he had on him. He said, \" I don't know who you are either!\" It should be noted at this point, it is daylight and I am wearing my full issued uniform that clearly shows I am a police officer. I told him as much and he responds with \"So?\"\n\nI advise him the only way I am going to walk towards him is if he lays down on the ground. He decides to sit. I command him to lay down. Instead, he just leans back. I make my approach, figuring this is the best I'm going to get from him, and draw my Taser, since one had is on his phone and the other is stretched out next to him.\n\nAs I get close, he decides to sit up and yell \"What, you gonna shoot me?\" I was about three steps away at this time and stated, \"Nope,\" as I holstered the Taser and grabbed his arm with the phone. He began pulling away, so I forced his arm out straight and tried to force him onto his stomach. The only problem was he was sitting cross-legged at the time so he had a little bit of leverage. I end up on his back and he is on his knees with both of his arms locked out and hands on the ground. \n\nAn assist officer goes sliding by and the guy begins trying to shake me off by throwing his right elbow back. Assist officer sees the motion and, using his baton, hits the only thing supporting this guy, his nice, locked-out, straight left arm. This does the trick and the guy collapses. We were able to cuff the guy. \n\nAfter the fact, the guy told the supervisor investigating the use of force the officer didn't hit me hard enough to hurt me but by the time he arrived at the hospital, he had, what I was told, a football-sized welp where the baton made contact.\n\nOh and the key was inside the guys pocket. In the end, what would have been a simple situation of giving the key back to the girl friend and finding this guy a way home turned into stealing, trespassing, and resisting arrest charges as well as a call to his probation officer and getting locked up for a minor warrant.\n\n**What is This?**\n\nI was cruising around my area riding in a two-man car due having one too few cars to drive that evening. We figured we would go looking for some fun. We watch as a car pulls in front of a known drug house and less than a minute later pull into the ally behind the house. We wait for the car to leave. \n\nIt leaves, but heads down a dead-end street with no residences. We follow because I figured they saw us watching. I noticed their window-tint was in violation so we pull them over.\n\nThe car is occupied by two guys, neither of which live in the area, both of whom had been caught with drugs in the past. We ask them to exit the vehicle, and then ask the driver if he would consent to a search of his vehicle. The driver says, \"Go ahead\" and my partner searches the car.\n\nAlmost immediately, he finds a sandwich bag with a white, powdery substance that was stuffed under the seat. He tells me to hook up our friends, so I do, using both pairs of handcuffs. He then asks them \"What is this?\" to which the passenger replies, \"Looks like cocaine to me.\" Both went to jail that day. The driver for a warrant and the passenger for the drugs since they were found under his seat.\n\n**Nice Try**\n\nWhen I got to work that night, I was told to be on the lookout for a woman who lives in the area who was wanted for stealing a semi-automatic rifle from a vehicle that was in the next city over. They told me where she lived so I drove by the address, since it was an apartment building, and noticed a car parked out front matching the description they gave out. I ran the license plate and it came back as a stolen car.\n\nI called for a few units and we set up around this apartment building. We tried contacting the woman at her apartment but nobody would come to the door(surprise, surprise) so instead we recovered the stolen car and \"left\". I went down the street to see if she would come out and try to leave by some other means. \n\nI notice a car pull into the lot of the apartment complex and I make my way closer so I can get a plate. As I am almost to the  car, it takes off down the street, running stops signs and a red light. I do not chase the car since we aren't allowed to chase for property crimes.\n\nThe next night, we go back to the apartment and try to make contact again. Yet again, nobody comes to the door, but as I am walking down the stairs, I notice a car parked next to the building. It was the same car as from the night before. I run the plate and guess what, it is stolen too. This car is also recovered. \n\nWhile I was doing paperwork for this car, another officer had a vehicle take off from him leaving the apartment. He was able to get a plate first and it was not stolen. It gave our detectives a new address to search for our suspect at. \n\nI was off for the next two nights. When I came back on the third night, I checked the apartment. The windows were wide open and there was not a single piece of furniture in the apartment. Our woman had moved out while I was off. It is only a matter of time before we find her at this point.\n\n**The End?**\n\nWell guys, here are a few of the things that I have been up to since my last story. If you liked this collection-style of stories, I can do a part 2, maybe even a part 3. Just let me know if you do and I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed typing it!

        "text": "Reading here pretty regularly, and thought i give you another suspects-pov story. \n\nThis one happened around 10 years ago, in Oklahoma City. I was working in Tech Support at the time, and so did some of my friends. Actually, one of my coworkers (let's call him [john]) and also my manager (let's call him [manager] in this story) happened to be good friends of mine in real life. We were all in our late 20s, early 30s at the time.\n\nAnyway, one day [John's] Girlfriend broke up with him, and understandably he was pretty upset about it. So this evening after work, [manager] and i decided to grab a few beers, folding chairs, cigars and take him out to the lake to have some quality bromance time. Those familiar with the OKC area: We ended up sitting around at Lake Hefner (Oklahoma Cities Water reservoir with a city park next to it), drinking a few beers and talking about life. Now, before you start yelling at me: I know about public drinking and intoxication laws. Also working as a volunteer firefighter at the time, i also know that usually - if you are not underage, not being loud and not being agressive - LE lets you get away with it, just telling you to empty your beer and get out.\n\nSo there we are, the three of us, sitting at the lake, as it is getting later and later... We only had a 6 pack, so each of us only had 2 beers in the last 4ish hours. When we realize it's past midnight already, 4 headlights pull up in the parking lot next to us. You guessed it right: Woopwoop, It's the sound of the police. \n\n4 Police officers walk up, nice and friendly, greeting us, asking if everything is okay and why we are sitting there. We tell them the story about our buddy, his breakup, us trying to cheer him up and all that. One of the officers gets our IDs and goes back to his cruiser, while the others stay with us. The officers do their thing, talking to us about what not (figuring out if we really are just doing what we said we are doing, probably see if we act suspicious, looking for inconsistencies in our stories - heck, you guys are cops, you know what i am talking about). Since we know why they are here, we know that they are doing their job and that we have nothing to hide, the whole situation is pretty chill, everybody is being nice, when the following conversation unfolds:\n\nOfficer 1: You know the City Park closes at 11pm, right?\nJohn: Oh, no, we actually didn't know that (we really didn't).\nMe: I guess that means we have to leave?\nOfficer 2: Well... here's the problem: Being within [Lake Hefner] city park limits at this time of the night is actually a jailable offense.\nOfficer 1: And you have been drinking, so... it's not looking good at the moment. \n\nJohn, Manager and I are looking at each other, realizing \"oh crap, we might have fucked up\". However, the Cops were chill all the time and we knew that if anybody was to blame it was us. We didn't even try to reason with them to not take us to Jail, because... you know, a suspect begging \"please don't take me to jail\" probably never worked before. All we did at this time was pretty much looking at each other somewhat amused/regretful, and realizing \"Well guys... Guess we are going to jail\".\n\nAt this point, the whole situation was still pretty relaxed: Three compliant Guys, drinking in public in a closed City Park about to go to jail for it. And four cops, being chill with us, during the whole process. Meanwhile Officer 3 comes back, steps aside with Officer 2, while the other two are keeping an eye on us. A few moments later they come back:\n\nOfficer 2: \"So guys, here's the situation: As we said, being here at this time of the day is a jailable offence. So is drinking in public (whatever the exact term was that they used). However, you have been peaceful and quiet the whole time. Long story short, we'll cut you a break. Empty out, pack up and go home. Next time police officers see you around here, you WILL go to Jail. Understood?\n\nAnd with that, we wished them a good night, a safe shift, they let us go and left. Another example how it pays of to be nice, friendly and don't try to weasel your way out of any mistakes that you might have made.\n\nLong story short: Almost got arrested for trespassing and drinking in public. Didn't argue with the cops about \"don't you have any real criminals to catch?\" and ended up fine because of it.\n\nEdit: can't keep my Jims and Johns right. Fixed the name confusion in this story. Also, fixed the number of compliant guys. Sorry about that, but i had to get off the computer a couple of times while typing this. My excuse is: I have a love sick teenage daughter at home, who just got dumped by her boyfriend and who is being an attention seeking drama queen par excellence at the moment. Me and my wives life is pretty much hell right now. ",

        "text": "I was working during rush hour in a busy, metropolitan area. I spotted a car pulled over to the shoulder on a busy freeway and stopped to check on them.\n\n\"Good afternoon, did your car break down?\"\n\n\"No, I was in a crash.\" Just a little fender-bender based on the minimal damage I could see.\n\n\"Oh.\" I looked around. \"Where's the other car?\"\n\n\"They already left.\"\n\n\"Okaaay...are you waiting for a tow truck?\"\n\n\"I didn't get any of their information. There was another State Trooper here a few minutes ago, but he left, and right after he left, the other car took off.\"\n\n\"Oooooh.\" Crap. \"Alright. Grab your information for me, please, and I can take a report on it.\"\n\nI called up my beat partner, Jones. Jones was known for being lazy. Where most of us were writing 2-3 crash reports a day, he regularly found himself not writing anything. \"Hey, were you at a crash a couple minutes ago?\" \n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"So what happened?\"\n\n\"I talked to one guy and he said they already exchanged information, so I left.\"\n\n\"You only asked one driver about it?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nI explained what happened. Jones replied, \"Well, it didn't happen on my beat anyway, so...\"\n\n\"Got it. I'll take care of it.\" It wasn't my beat either, but it was the busiest beat in the state, and we always helped whoever got stuck with it.\n\nI spoke with the driver, who didn't get any follow up information for the other car (like a license plate). And the other driver realized once the police were gone, he could get away. I wrote a report, but it was just for insurance purposes at that point.\n\nThe longer Jones was at that office, the fewer Troopers came to help him out as they learned he did everything he could to avoid paperwork. He transferred out not long after.",

        "text": "this is my first time posting on reddit so lets see what happens\n\nPeople are gonna ask me, \"why the fuck were you in an abandoned mental hospital anyways?\" No, I'm not homeless, and no i don't smoke crack.  The city I'm from has abandoned buildings all over the place and has a culture of urban exploring, I'm one of those people who are caught up in this culture and I'm fascinated by them\n\nThis certain hospital is about an hour away from me Its a huge property that sprawls some thing like 300 acres and has many buildings. the entire place is creepy as fuck and is said to be haunted and i believe that is true because i have experienced some creepy fucking shit while I've visited this place, it has 2 stories underground the entire property with tunnels, i have been in certain areas like the morgue but most of passages you can't go through because its flooded \nMe, and my 2 friends kinda made plans to go visit this place. this happened around 2 years ago i was 16, and my 2 friends were 17 and 18. i always explore these buildings and i was gonna show them around and show them how the place looked as i had visited it before, my dumbass knew that it was a half mile away from a state police station, but i didn't know they had routine patrols going in and out of it. \nTo get on the property you basically have to park in a church near it, and they have designated trails in the woods behind it, that are for \"spiritual walks\" you go off the trails onto a service road connected to it and you just kinda walk in. we had some weed on us, a bowl, and a vape so we didn't really have that much on us but we had enough to get into some serious trouble. We went into the building and we explored throughout the entire thing recording everything just having a good time and we were smoking too. \nit got to a point where it was getting darker and we started heading out. we always had planned that if a cop showed up we would run but we never really expected it to happen, i did it handful of times before and have never been caught\nso we walk out of the side entrance of the hospital, and basically were all high as fuck. our eyes were bloodshot we just finished smoking a blunt and we were pretty fucked. The side entrance had a passage towards the back of the building where cars can't go, and has a road in front of it that is usable. we walked out of the building and a cop drove up as soon as we left... we saw the cop and 2 seconds later we were running like fucking hell. we had shit on us and couldn't afford the charges \nmy 2 friends ran back into the building, and i ran into the back where he couldn't see or come to me because of the bushes and trees (nature overtook the property pretty bad)\ni had decided to run away from the building and my adrenaline was fucking pumping. the weed had me super cloudy and confused but i was running like hell. i stupidly ran out on the road, away from the cop its like a little road covered by trees on both sides and he couldn't see me so my plan was to go back to my car, and wait for my friends. the cop eventually came down the road and saw me and immediately sped up to me, being 16 at the time i thought i would get into serious trouble having a vape on me so decided to throw it in the woods next to me...\nthe cop pulls up on me, gets out of the car and looks at me and yells \"what makes you think to run away from a cop??\" \nat this point, i was shitting the hardest bricks ever.\ni kinda stuttered i knew i smelled like weed, and my eyes were red so he knew something was up, i told him i was super scared and that i had never been in trouble before (which was true) so he goes to ask me what i threw in the woods and obviously he assumes it was marijuana but it in reality it was a vape and i told him that\nhe told me to call my friends and to tell them to come to me or he would've been pissed, in the meanwhile he made me look for my vape while they came\nmy friends could've easily left me, but they came, obviously ditching the weed and bowl. He questioned us asking us what we were doing there and why we ran and everything like that. so basically he didn't pat us down or anything like that, all he made us do was take the things out of of our pockets and he asked or ID but we didn't have any to show him. \nIt got to point where the vape was the main concern he said he would get a team to search it and would find it immediately and stuff like that but he was bluffing. he thought it was weed. \nhe said we had 15 minutes to search for the vape before a 2nd cop came to the property and \"his options change\" \nat this point he was fucking playing games with us. but he knew that we were seriously trying find the vape on top of the fact we looked like pretty innocent kids \n20 or 25 minutes go by and he starts to talk to us and pressure us saying that if a 2nd cop comes were fucked for sure and all of this type of bullshit. 30 minutes went by and the cop calls us over, he looks at his watch, looks at us and with the straightest face in the world says \"if you can run and beat me to the front of the property i might consider something\" \nat this point we were running for our fucking lives. the entrance was like a half mile and he made us sprint for the gate. we got pretty close when he started driving up towards us, he would rev up his engine to pretend he was gonna go in front of us but truthfully was jut being a dick\nwe all got to the front and he gets out of the car and locks up the gate to the property and he told us that he could've charged us with many things including obstruction of justice and trespassing and could've easily gave each of us a year of probation. he kinda went on to explain why we shouldn't run from cops and shit like that and to never come back to the property. he also said quote \"i have to explain to my boss why i was here for 45 minutes when i was only supposed to be here for 15\"\nhe made us walk to my car. which took almost an hour.\nhe could've fucked us up and got us probation on top of fines and other things but he let us go, and i think it was the dopest thing ever considering the hard time we gave him at first \nMoral of the story: if you want to urban explore, do some fucking research.\n\n \n",

But if you were in an emergency vehicle with lights on, going to an emergency call, it would've been pretty good.\" I handed him the recruiting card. \"We're always hiring.\" His face lit up as he said, \"I actually just applied!\"",

        "text": "This is my first post on reddit so please be gentle!\n\n\n**[Edit - Sorry it's so freakin' long!]**\n\nIt was around 10 p.m. on a Saturday Evening. I had just finished my shift at KFC and was walking to the grocery store to grab some milk, which was the opposite way from my apartment. As I walked down the street, I saw a car driving towards me. Well, I saw lots of cars driving towards me as it was the main street into town, but what singled this car out was the noise that it was making. It's hard to explain but a kind of loud banging/rattle noise. Loud enough that I noticed it while it was a hundred meters away. \n\n\nWhen the car got closer it pulled into this driveway. It was the driveway to this parking lot but you had to drive through an arch to get into it, so the car was completely blocking the driveway, and half a lane of the road. \n\n\nAs I walked even with it, I noticed that the front right tire was flat, and that there was an older guy in the driver's seat. As it was a cold, rainy, and windy night, I walked over to help. When I got to the car I realized that it wasn't the older guy driving, it was a young guy. I'm a Canadian, and while I'd lived in the UK for 8 years at this point, the whole steering wheel situation still throws me off sometimes. \n\n\nI was already there so I decided to help the guy anyway, since, like I said before it was cold and rainy and windy. The old guy got out of the car, and he was looking at the tires trying to find the one that was flat. The driver was still sitting in the car, holding the steering wheel with both hands, 10 and 2. There was an older lady in the back. I'm pretty sure the driver was the older people's son. \n\n\nI went to the older guy and said, \"Hey, I'm wiqwqoot, sorry about your tire, I'll give you a hand. Pretty cold, eh?\". Old guy looked at me, blinked a dozen times and then rattles off in what I was 80% sure was Polish, but 100% sure I didn't understand. I did the universal shoulder shrug meaning, \"No idea what you're talking about,\" and went to talk to the son. He was standing in the middle of the road, evidently bewildered at how this could have happened. I had a pretty similar conversation with him, and then played an elaborate game of charades trying to explain how I was going to change the tire, since he obviously had no clue. \n\n\nI signaled that I wanted him to pop the trunk, and he looked around the driver's compartment (I'm guessing for a release) for a while before he went and opened it manually. I grabbed the spare and looked for the tools but I couldn't find it immediately so I signaled again for the tools and he opened a bunch of bags and compartments before he finally found them. \n\n\nAt this point I was a little on edge, mostly because I was concerned that the vehicle might be stolen, based on the difficulty he had both finding the trunk release (which didn't exist) and the tools. So when I went over to the front tire, I positioned myself so I didn't have to turn my back to him. That may seem silly but I just had a feeling about it and I was suspicious of a guy holding a tire iron so I wasn't taking any chances. \n\n\nI popped off the hubcap, and handed it to the guy. And by handed it I mean I presented it to him so he could take it, and he stared at it. I put it under the car. I took the tire iron and started loosening the first nut. It was super tight, and I could do it, but sometimes I'm too nice so I basically moved back to let him do the hard work. It's not like it would have been difficult for him. As he leaned forward, I suddenly realised exactly why this guy was suspicious. Vodka. The man reeked. I hadn't seen him walk at this point and I don't know any Polish (or whatever) at all, so I didn't pick up on the slurring in his voice. It made sense. The flat tire, the trunk difficulty, the tool difficulty. This guy was hammered. Driving around drunk with his parents. \n\n\nIt was a Saturday night, which meant what the bars were busy and you get lots of tipsy people jaywalking and this guy was headed into town. I have zero tolerance for any drink driving but that was a catastrophe waiting to happen. I really did not want this guy going anywhere. \n\n\nSo I grabbed my phone, and he was staring at me, looking pretty freaked out. I tried to say I was calling a garage for help, and he seemed to understand because he relaxed a bit. (If I was in this situation again, I would have called 999 (UK emergency number) right away.). I dialled 101, which is the police non emergency number, but my phone had no minutes left, which meant that I couldn't call (If I was in this situation again, I would have called 999 (UK emergency number) right away). I was about to call 999, and my phone died. Not good.\n\n\nI looked around and realised that I was only 100 or so meters from the police station. I didn't want this guy leaving once he realised where I had gone, but I couldn't get to his keys as he was leaning on the door and I wasn't sure about the legal ramifications of taking someone's keys. (Again, next time I won't second guess myself.) \n\n\nSuddenly I thought of a way that I could stop him from leaving without him realising what was happening. The guy was sitting there trying to take his wheel off by tightening the nuts. He was too far gone to know what to do, which was the key to my plan. I grabbed the jack and stuck it into the jack point on the chassis. I jacked and jacked and jacked until the car was as high as it possibly could go. The handle was attached to the jack so I couldn't take it off but I tucked it up into the chassis. Then I stood up, said that I would get help and trotted off towards the police station. I was almost there when I heard the shouting start behind me with the one Polish word I do understand being screamed repeatedly by all three of them. (Hint: it's not a very nice word). I go into the police station and tell the officer that there was a drunk driver just down the street and that he had a flat tire and couldn't move, but that I thought he was going to try to leave. The officer thanked me and told me to stay away from the guy, and that he'd send someone over to check.\n\n\nI walked back, but on the other side of the street. I wasn't going to let a drunk stop me from getting milk. As I walked by I watched as the old lady was pushing the back of the car, the old man was pushing the side of the car near the jack, and the son was gunning the engine. All while screaming at me and trying to wave me over. I could hear the metal from the jack screeching on the cement as the car rocked. I just kept walking, as per the officer's instructions, and they kept pushing and revving.\n\nA couple minutes of walking later, I was almost at the store and three cop cars went flying by with the lights and sirens on. I went and bought my milk. I walked back home, and as I was passing the spot, I looked through the arch and the car had made it through there to the parking lot, but was completely surrounded by 4-5 cop cars. The occupants were nowhere to be seen, and the police were searching the car very, very thoroughly. \n\n\nI went home, plugged my phone in, and had a very nice voicemail from an officer thanking me very much for my report and saying that the person driving the vehicle was many times over the limit, and that they found all sorts of questionable substances in the car. He mentioned that I might be called as a witness but that it was unlikely as there was so much evidence. \n\n\nIt was nice to have helped get this guy off the road but I always feel bad for the parents, who I'm certain were sober. They seemed like nice people who were just trying to protect their son. It's one thing to be a bad parent, but you have to be a special kind of bad to want your kid to grow up to be a dealer. They didn't seem like those kind of people, and it was sad that they had to get mixed up in that, and probably have been dealing with their son's antics for a long time.\n\n\nTL;DR - A drunk guy had a flat tire and I jacked his car up so high that he couldn't get away before the police showed up.",

        "text": "This is Tales from the Academy.\n\nWe get trained on the three weapons that we use: pistol, rifle, and shotgun. Prior to the Academy, I had shot a pistol once, shot a rifle a handful of times, and never fired a shotgun. Since I lived in a big city, most ranges were indoor and didn't even allow shotguns to be used. That meant all the experience I ever had with a shotgun was from trooper training. We try to train for the real world, which meant very little standing still while trying to hit stationary pieces of paper. It's more running and gunning, and reactionary shooting.\n\nA few days into it we did practical drills. One of our practical drills had us drive up to a scene, start taking fire, get out and engage the suspects with the shotgun.This was also a type of stress inoculation. I saw a few people go ahead of me, and they made most hits.\n\nI rolled up, released the shotgun, and jumped out with it. As soon as I jumped out, instructors near me starting shooting off blanks, while other instructors would bang on the car and try to rattle me. The targets in this case were two steel ones, roughly 15 yards away. We were instructed to fire two rounds, then move.\n\nSafety off, round loaded, I pulled the trigger. \"MISS!\" The instructor yelled out. Pump, reload, fire. \"MISS!\" Zero for two with a shotgun, which is supposed to be easy to hit things with. We were given nine rounds.\n\nI retreated to cover to reload, with an instructor alongside me and yelling at me. \"PUT OUT SOME RADIO TRAFFIC! HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE! HOW MANY SUSPECTS ARE THERE?! HOW ABOUT SOME DESCRIPTIONS! DO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE SOME BACKUP AS YOU'RE GETTING SHOT AT?!\"\n\nI'm reloading, fumbling, putting out pretty garbage radio traffic as my adrenaline is dumping. The instructor yelled again, \"ADVANCE!\" I started moving and firing. Miss. Reload. Miss. Reload. Miss. I ended up missing all nine shots. \"NEXT TRAINEE!\" The instructor didn't say anything to me, but I knew I was terrible. \n\nA couple weeks later, we had finished just about all of the firearm training. We did the same drill again. It was the same instructor with the same scenario. And I really didn't want to feel like I was useless again.\n\nI rolled up, released the shotgun, and jumped out. Safety off, pump, fire. TING! The metal let's you know when you hit it. TING! Second hit, and I retreated back to cover. The instructor started yelling again while I took a deep breath to slow my heartrate, \"PUT OUT THAT RADIO TRAFF-\"\n\nI was already doing it while I reloaded, nice and steady. He stopped yelling and listened. \"ADVANCE!\"\n\nFire. TING! Reload, fire. TING! Reload, fire. TING! I hit every shot that time, and the drill ended.\n\nThe instructor ordered, \"Weapon on safe.\" He looked at me and paused. \"What the hell happened? Where have you been? It's like a different person.\"\n\nI still hate that shotgun.",

I guess I'm sort of somebody who disregards the law; I'm no thief or violent person, but I do take the risk of being out past curfew because I enjoy the nighttime and the police officers in our town never really enforce it. Well, they did last weekend. xD\n\nIt was a cold night and it was well past curfew. I had a rough day and went out for a walk to clear my mind. I was walking down the street listening to my music and there wasn't a soul in sight. Very peaceful indeed.\n\nI'm on the outer edge of town when one of our town's cops comes rolling up behind me. I had stopped to tie my shoe and turned around to see him. I don't get anxious around cops and so I waved and he waved back and stepped out of the car. I had never seen him before; he must be new to the force.\n\n\"Evening, how are you?\" He asked.\n\n\"Fine, thank you.\"\n\n\"You live around here? How old are you?\"\n\n\"15. Yes, I live on *Insert street here.*\n\n\"Oh... well, you're out past curfew, miss.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I am...\" \n\n\"Sorry, but I can't have you walking around this late at night. Step over here, please.\"\n\nI sighed. \n\n\"Alright.\" I wanted to get this over with.\n\nI walked on over to the car and placed my hands on it. He patted me down and found the pocket knife I keep on me. He took it and asked if I was feeling ok and I said I was. He then took my information and asked if I ever violated curfew before and I said I didn't. \n\n\"Do me a favor, turn around and place your hands behind your back for me, please.\" I was caught off guard by this but complied. After being handcuffed, he placed me in the back seat and buckled me in. The drive home was uncomfortable, to say the least. When we got home, we went up to my door and he knocked and my dad answered.\n\n\"Sir, I found your daughter out past curfew. Were you aware that she wasn't home?\"\n\nMy dad looked at me with a look of disappointment.\n\n\"No, I wasn't. I apologize, officer.\" He looked at me again and the officer smiled.\n\n\"It's fine. Since this is her first time, I'll let her off with a warning, but next time a fine will follow.\" He went behind me and removed the handcuffs and gave me back my pocket knife before letting me step inside the house.\n\n\"Thank you officer.\" My dad said.\n\n\"No problem; have a nice night, folks.\" He left, leaving me and my dad alone. \n\nI'm doing plenty of chores this week as punishment.",

Was just like 99% of the rest of my stops at this point, was going to run his license and check for warrants, get a good sniff inside the car, you know. I explain why he was stopped and he doesn’t argue, I take his license back to my truck and do my thing. I go back to his car, with my verbal warning prepared and I see him drawing on a piece of paper. Weird. He then proceeds to show me a diagram of what he says is a “wide left turn” and that while he doesn’t argue his infraction, he would actually like to see it enforced more often, along with “wide left turns”. I began to explain to him that there is no such thing as a wide left then to which he interrupts me to tell me that there is in fact a wide left turn in the “traffic law”. I then take a short breath and say “Sir, that may be true, but here in Texas we have a transportation code, and wide left turns aren’t in it.” I tried my best to be as polite as possible, but he still just seemed so defeated. Almost like he had a nice well done PowerPoint put together and I stopped him before he could even get going. Not a super exciting one, but it still makes me laugh a little to this day. \n\n\nSide note. My partner discovered (to our Sgts surprise even) that the Texas transportation code does in fact have a wide left turn. But it’s under the same statute as wide right, just only applies when turning from a one way street onto another one way street. lol ",

I looked at my Garmin and saw that I was speeding, so I promptly pulled over and threw my hazards on with a quickness, whilst grabbing my wallet to grab my DL and Insurance card. After about 2 minutes, the officer came up to my window and asked the age old question \"do you know why I pulled you over?\". I explained that I hadn't noticed the drop in the speed limit and that I would be willing to accept the ticket as I was breaking the law. He seemed kind of shocked that I was upfront and willing to accept responsibility for my actions, and seemed pretty chill. I handed over all of my information so he could do what he needed to do, fully expecting a ticket.\n\n He came back with some news that blew my mind, shocked me, then had me a little upset (to say the least). I had a bench warrant out of a small town just outside of the place where the Pony Football team originally from Baltimore for an unpaid ticket, which I had been there about a year prior and completely spaced it off (My father was on his death bed) and forgot all about it. He told me that he would have to arrest me and I would remain at the jail until they came almost 100 miles to pick me up. I knew I had no choice, but I wasn't happy about it. That being said, I knew it wasn't his fault, that he was just doing his job and trying to provide for his family. I asked him if I could have a cigarette before he placed me in cuffs, which he did allow.\n\n My girlfriend took the keys to my car and I told her that as soon as I got to the small town that I would call her so she could come pick me up. I smoke my cigarette and I cuff up, get in the back seat of the cruiser, and try to relax. The officer and I talk on the way to the jail, which he tells me that he wasn't going to give me a ticket for speeding because I was co-operative and polite, which was pretty awesome on his part. Needless to say, I didn't want to go, but sometimes you just gotta man up and do what needs to be done. I spent 2 days in that jail waiting to be picked up, where they put me in with a large group of Neo-Nazis, which wasn't good as I'm Jewish. I stayed up for those two days, stuck in a corner, not doing much of anything and keeping my mouth shut until I was told that they were there to pick me up.\n\n An hour and a half later, we arrive at the small city where I promptly call my girlfriend to let her know I'm there. She is already in town and has been for the last day and a half. I tell her to meet me at the local pharmacy next to the jail. I talk to the correctional officers, use my credit card to pay my bail (which was the cost of the ticket and court costs) and I'm out within 30 minutes of getting there. I was told I had to go to court the next morning, which I wasn't going to miss again. I go back to the hotel where my girlfriend was staying at, stay the night, get up and head to the courthouse the next morning, only to find myself not on the docket. I ask the lady doing the sign ins and she said since the ticket and court costs had been paid, I didn't need to be there. 3 days lost all because I forgot to pay an 85 dollar ticket. I haven't missed any payments like that since. Since this, I moved to said city where I was arrested and deal with LEO at my job, I will never hold any hard feelings towards any of them.\n\nTL;DR: Forgot a ticket, was in jail for 3 days because I'm a moron.    \n\nEdit: One word and additional sentence.",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying that it wasn't so much a ridealong as I was present on the scene, but as military, not as an LEO.\n\nOver a decade ago, I was part of a military unit that was manning a permanent roadblock along a particular stretch of road. Nothing fancy, just three soldiers guarding three MPs. Cars would go through one of the three lanes, and 99% of the time would be waved through without any problems. One night I'm on the evening shift, and we see four police cars have entirely blocked off the opposite direction on the highway. To put this into perspective, the roadblock was only in one direction, so traffic in the other direction was ALWAYS going through at 90-100 KPH. We immediately radio this in and flag down one of the cops to find out what the story is, and if it has any bearing on us. Turns out somebody was reversing back down the highway, and they were blocking the road until he could be stopped and figure out what his story was. About 15 minutes later the car, hazards flashing and driving at about 5 KPH reaches the roadblock and the cops take over. Fin.\n\nAbout two years later I was going out with this girl, and a little while in we got to talking about my military service. She was really interested, especially when I told her I served in X province. She said she had visited there once with her family. The grandfather was driving, and had missed his exit. He realized that the next exit of this very long highway is a troublesome area, and he wanted no part in being there. (Just as an aside, it really wasn't, the troublesome area started about 30 KM after that exit, but combine an imaginative local media and an old grandfather, and voila!). Realizing the situation he had put his family in, he decided the smartest thing was to pull over to the shoulder, and reverse his way back to civilization. \n\nWe compared timelines and, you guessed it, she was in that car that I had seen.

        "text": "No matter what any psychiatrist will tell you, Little Man Syndrome is real. The smallest guys have the biggest mouths and are always the first to try (and usually fail) to back it up. Ricky was one such individual. He came up to most people’s waists, and weighed about 110 pounds, which was also the number of minutes a day he spent not talking. Even think about challenging him on anything, from his behavior to the score of the game, and he’d yammer your ear off telling you about his “time in the system.” Never mind that he’d celebrated his 19th birthday with us in jail, or that he’d never seen the inside of a DOC van let alone a facility, he would try to convince anyone and everyone who’d listen that he was Billy Badass and had done a two-spot in max security upstate. He was one of our “problem children” and wore that label like a badge of honor, even if it did mean he got twisted up and sent to segregation every other week.\n\nOne slow night, I was sitting at my post in segregation, when I heard the unmistakable sound of a foot against a cell door. I got up to investigate the source of the kicking, and was greeted by Ricky, standing at the door, pounding away. \n\n“What’s up, man?” I greeted him.\n\n“Man, I’m just trying to take a shower, Muff_Huffer.”\n\nMy partner, Country Mike, had wandered up behind me. Mike was, in fact, from the country, and despite his imposing size was very easy-going and quiet. He was not, however, one to push too far. While he definitely subscribed to the mantra of “less is more” when it came to some aspects of the job, he was not afraid to get his hands dirty and was a great guy to have on your side. \n\n“Ricky, banging on the door isn’t gonna get you a shower,” Mike interjected.\n\n“Man, I know that, but I missed my chance to do it today. It ain’t gonna take but 15 minutes.”\n\n“Everyone is on lockdown for the night, we’re not just going to run showers for people at 1 AM, you know that.”\n\n“Bruh, I’m just trying to wash my ass. I’ll be quick.”\n\n“Look, Ricky.” Mike stepped up to the window. “I can’t do it now, but if I get a chance here in a while, I’ll try to get you one tonight. Ok?”\n\n“Alright bruh, that’s cool. I got you.”\n\n“Ok. Quit kicking the door.”\n\nRicky nodded and we turned back to whatever we were working on. After just 45 seconds of blissful silence, the banging resumed. Mike and I returned to Ricky’s cell. I threw up my hands at him in exasperation.\n\n“Dude, come on! We just talked about this.”\n\n“I know, bruh, I’m ready, come on, let’s go.”\n\n“What did we just tell you?”\n\n“That I could come out and get a shower.”\n\n“Yeah, in a while. Not right now.”\n\n“I know, but I want one now and shit.”\n\n“Not happening. Just be cool for an hour or two and we’ll try to squeeze it in.”\n\n“Bruh, that’s crazy, bruh! I need to wash my ass!” Ricky resumed kicking the door, as if it were my shins instead. Mike chimed in again.\n\n“Well, now since you wanna act dumb, you’re not getting it. There. Done. I was the one that offered you the opportunity, and now I’m gonna take it away because you’re acting dumb.”\n\nRicky grunted in anger and put down his towel and shampoo. “You really gonna do that?”\n\nMike nodded. “I just did.”\n\n“Ay man, that’s fucked up! How are you gonna deny me a shower?”\n\n“Because you already had the chance earlier and you missed it then. Mike was gonna be cool, give up some of his time, and do you a favor by giving you an extra chance, but now since you want to kick the door and act foolish, it’s not gonna happen. And if you keep kicking the door, you’re gonna go in the chair.”\n\n“Man, fuck the chair! I ain’t scared of the chair! Put me in that shit! I’m ready, let’s go.” Rickey continued to kick the door. Mike and I looked at each other and shrugged.\n\n“Guess I’ll go get it,” I said, and went to find the restraint chair. I returned to the cell with the chair and a word to my interested LT (“Preventing damage to county property, sir”) and set it next to Mike.\n\n“You gonna be cool and just sit in it, or do we have to put you in it?” Mike asked.\n\n“Man, I don’t care. Let’s go.” Rickey turned around and offered his hands in the cuffing position. We opened the door and put the cuffs on without incident, and began to lead him out into the chair. Halfway there, though, he started to pull away from us. I grabbed on and put him down into the chair. Mike, on the other hand, who was bigger than me and Ricky put together, tried to put Ricky THROUGH the chair, Goldberg style. I could do nothing but watch, as Mike wrapped his arms around Ricky and deftly picked Ricky off of his feet (sure, only two inches, but he was still in the air), driving him back into the chair like a linebacker hitting a miniscule scat-back. Ricky hit the hard plastic as Mike’s shoulder hit Ricky’s chest, and a loud *whoosh* of Ricky’s breath left him. I felt his arm loosen as the fight went out of him, even with that minimal bit of effort on our part. We quickly slid the straps on and began to pull and tighten them as Ricky gasped for his breath back.\n\n“huuuuh…guh….I can’t breathe, bruh.”\n\n“You can talk, you can breathe,” Mike and I said in unison, as we pulled the leg straps tight. We wheeled him over to where we could keep an eye on him and where the nurse had easy access, and returned to our work. The nurse came by and gave a precursory tug on the straps before giving her approval, and heading back to her nurse hangout elsewhere. This left us sitting at our post with Ricky parked, looking right at us.\n\n“That’s crazy how you did that, bruh. You really put me in the chair.”\n\nI looked at him and shrugged. “Ricky, you literally asked us to. What were we gonna do, not put you in the chair?”\n\nRicky paused for a second and thought. It was plain for anyone to see the one wheel in his head, turning very slowly. “Well…y’all never do what we want y’all to do, right?” I nodded, interested to see what line Ricky’s convoluted logic would take. “I knew y’all ain’t tryna give me a shower. But I was tryna go in the chair, so….so like…” Ricky’s brain gave out at this point, and he looked perplexed by his own statement.\n\n“You thought if you told us you didn’t want to go in the chair, we would put you in it?” I offered.\n\n“Yeah!” Ricky’s face lit up. “Cuz I was tryna go in the chair for real. So then, I shouldn’t have said that. Wait. Hold up. I got that backwards.” He looked crestfallen.\n\n“Yep. You got it.” I chuckled back. “I mean, acting like that you were gonna go in it anyway.”\n\n“I know. And I was tryna go in it for real, but Mike ain’t have to do me like that. I wasn’t tryna fight or nothing. I’m sorry, bruh. You gon let me out, bruh?”\n\nNow, this is usually the part where someone sheds crocodile tears and begs for us to reverse our decision. It’s kind of like when you arrest the abusive boyfriend for DV, and the girl changes her tune and begs you not to take him to me. Ricky, on the other hand, actually seemed genuinely remorseful, and looking back on it now, I’m not sure he had the mental chops to try a play like that. Regardless, he was staying put.\n\n“Nah, man. You gotta stay put for a while.”\n\n“If you’re cool for a while, we’ll let you out in a little bit,” Mike added.\n\n“Oh, aight then.” Ricky did his best to hunker down and make himself comfortable. It took about three minutes before he piped up again. “Ay man, I’m cool man, I been quiet bruh, I’m really just tryna go back to the room, bruh, you gon let me out now?”\nI looked at my watch. \n“Dude, it hasn’t even been five minutes.”\n\n“Oh. Aight.”\n\nThis sequence repeated itself six or seven more times, with no more then 5 minutes between each go-round. After 45 or so minutes, Ricky only had this gem to add – \n\n“Ay, y’all make me feel like a retarded kid or something!”\n\nI laughed, and Mike said exactly what I was thinking. “That's because you are, Ricky!”\n\nRicky thankfully took this as friendly banter and not an insult, and laughed to himself. “You right, Mike. But that’s crazy how y’all did that!” After a few more minutes, we wheeled him back to his cell and let him back in. Ricky seemed to take the whole experience as a joke, telling me later there were no hard feelings and offering a fist bump through the cell window, a rare moment of self-recognition both for Ricky, and on the part of any of the inmates I ever deal with.\n\nRicky left my unit later that week, and I didn’t see him for a while. One fateful night, though, he returned. It was a terrible night. Despite it being well into summer, it was unseasonably cool, and it seemed like everyone with a set of legs was out using them to go and get into trouble. I walked in past a packed intake rail full of hostile drunks (some sure to be my problem later in the night) and took over a segregation unit with every cell full to the point of bursting. Even though it was hardly past dinnertime, the drunk tank was full, and most of my guys were awake and shouting back and forth to each other. There were already some pressing matters at hand when I took over, so I set to work (along with Country Mike) putting out the fires that the dayshift had left us. We had barely even gotten a start on our own work, a good hour in to the shift, when I walked past Ricky’s new cell.\n\n“Ay bruh, it’s Muff_Huffer! Ay man, what’s good? Look man, you gotta move me, man, I can’t be doubled up in the cell like this, bruh, that’s crazy, bruh. I need to go in one of those empty cells you got in intake, bruh.”\n\n“Ricky, everyone is doubled up. Intake doesn’t have room for you either. You gotta make it work.” Ricky clicked his tongue in disgust and I went on my way. I had to return back by his cell to get to where I was going, and I had almost made it past before he tapped on his window again.\n\n“Ay Muff_Huffer, I’m gonna kill myself, bruh, for real bruh, now you gotta move me, man, gotta be by myself, so let’s go, man, take me over to Intake, bruh.” \n\nRicky’s shit-eating grin spread across his face, knowing that I was basically powerless to do anything in the face of his “suicidal statement”. I groaned and continued on my way, now faced with the prospect of clearing the drunks out of Intake’s rubber room that was currently being used as an improvised drunk tank. I dragged my feet in protest as I approached Country Mike at post, and plopped myself down in a chair to contemplate my life and how every choice I had ever made had gotten me here. Mike looked at me quizzically.\n\n“Ricky is saying he’s going to kill himself, so that he can go on a suicide watch and be by himself. Now he’s gonna be in the rubber room in Intake annoying everyone all night. And I have to get the drunks out.” I groaned again. Mike joined in for a moment, before a lightbulb went off and he grabbed the desk phone. After a quick phone call, we suddenly learned that our fortunes had changed, and that Ricky had gambled, and lost – badly.\n\nYou see, Ricky had assumed that the suicide cells were full up, and at our facility, it was a rare day that they weren’t. When that happened, the next course of action was to use Intake’s rubber room as a suicide cell – it was a dry cell, after all, and (as you might have guessed) rubber-coated like the suicide cells. It was also smack dab in the middle of Intake, where the inmate in question had a great view of everyone coming in (including – gasp – females!), and also provided ample opportunity to annoy a whole cadre of deputies. Based on those two big perks, it was a popular request for movements, despite the lack of bed or toilet. Ricky failed to consider, however, the miraculously open suicide cell, which was a third of the size, hidden away from everyone else, freezing cold, and worst of all, required the inmate to surrender all their clothing as a suicide deterrent (more on that in a later story). Armed with this piece of good news, Mike and I returned to Ricky’s cell.\n\n“Aight bruh, you ready? I’m tryna go.”\n\n“You for real, Ricky? You really gonna do it?” I asked, giving him one last chance to redeem himself.\n\n“Yeah, bruh, I’m feeling suicidal as a bitch, bruh.” Ricky grinned, knowing all three of us could see through his ruse. I simply shrugged.\n\n“Ok then. Pack your stuff.”\n\nRicky excitedly clapped and turned to collect his bedroll. He dragged it to the door, and we calmly let him out and began to walk him out of the unit. He headed for Intake, but we opened the door that led to where the suicide cells were. We gestured for him to follow. Ricky stopped and looked at us.\n\n“Oh nah, man, I gotta go to the suicide joint?”\n\nMike and I nodded in unison. “Yep,” we replied in perfect harmony.\n\n“Aww…damn.” Ricky paused for a moment.\n\nThis was usually the part where inmates became combative – either they began to argue that they weren’t REALLY suicidal, or they just straight up started to fight, all to avoid going into the suicide room, where they were inevitably dragged. Ricky, however, simply hung his head and trudged through the doorway. Mike and I shared a glance (“Wow, too easy”) and followed him slowly to the suicide cells. Ricky waited patiently for us to open the requisite doors and gloomily followed us in to the suicide unit. We opened the suicide cell and he slowly walked inside, before turning to Mike and I.\n\n“Y’all know I wasn’t serious, right?” Ricky shakily asked. We nodded.\n\n“Yeah man, but you said you were gonna kill yourself, so you gotta stay. It’ll just be tonight, they’ll give you the okay tomorrow morning.” Mike hoped his little explanation would keep Ricky calm. We were already too far behind to lose an hour to a fight and all the paperwork that went with it.\n\nRicky sighed and looked at his feet, before looking back at us, now holding the special hang-yourself-proof blanket.\n\n“I gotta take off my clothes and everything?” \n\nWe nodded again. Mike held up the blanket so that Ricky could have a modicum of privacy behind it. Ricky sighed again and began to disrobe. As he kicked off his pants, he gave us another one of his trademark interjections.\n\n“Man, y’all got me feeling like I’m a short bus kid, bruh, like I’m retarded or something, bruh!” Rickey half-laughed as he accepted the blanket in lieu of pants. We laughed just as hard as we had the first time. A self-proclaimed retard he may have been, but one of the wiser ones I ever met.\n",

        "text": "I was working patrol on a rural road with a couple other Troopers and an aircraft. It was a narrow, windy road with a double-yellow line to indicate no passing. The aircraft was far better at providing enforcement in this section than us alone because we couldn't find any safe place to park in the twisty section to monitor traffic. The pilot would call out a car and a description, and we'd stop it a bit up the road and write the ticket. The ticket would include the pilot information since he was the Trooper who saw the violation. He was also only calling out vehicles that were blatantly crossing into incoming lanes multiple times, and not the rare slip up. Even so, we stopped 4/5 cars going through the area.\n\nI stopped one of many, and it was a pretty standard interaction.\n\n\"Good evening, I stopped you for crossing over the double-yellow lines.\" I always paused to see their reaction, which was usually contemplation. I pointed up, \"We've got an airplane overhead.\" And then the mental lightbulb would go on. \n\nIn this car, there was a dog that was barking at me. I try to make friends, so I asked the driver, \"Can I pet him?\" That usually gets them to stop barking. The driver said, \"Mmmm, no, he's not going to be friendly.\" What I heard was, \"I'm a terrible dog owner.\" The driver was polite enough, and we briefly discussed where he was going and coming from.\n\nI came back with the ticket. The driver went from Bruce Banner to the Hulk in demeanor. \"I can't believe you would write me a ticket for something as stupid as this!\"\n\nI shot back, \"The lady who died here two weeks ago in a head-on crash probably wouldn't think it's stupid.\" Those are the scenes I try to prevent, and that was an actual event.\n\nI stopped another one of the drivers a few minutes later, and gave the same explanation about the airplane. This driver seemed almost impressed. \"I always see those signs, but I thought they were just trying to scare us. I didn't know you actually used an airplane!\" She still got a ticket, but was a much better sport about it. \"I'm sorry, it won't happen again, have a great day!\"",

        "text": "Relevant context- I used to be a CO. This is actually my first time posting here since I left the prison, which is pretty bittersweet. Anyway, this takes place in a medium-high security level institution in a GP housing unit. Our offenders walk around freely in their assigned wing most of the time and have their own keys to their cells. There are two offenders assigned to each cell. Also, fair warning: I love to write and I’m long-winded as hell. If you don’t like long stories, this is not for you!\n\n\n\nThis was my day to do “paper.” Essentially this means that I’m operating the main control module or “bubble”: keeping a chrono of everything going on in the house, making announcements on the intercoms, answering any radio traffic for our housing unit, watching the wings in front of me as well as the cameras, etc. Essentially, everything other than actually walking around the housing unit. Now, the reason that we call the control module the “bubble” is because it’s almost entirely made of windows. This allows us to see into the lobby (behind us) as well as into the wings (in front of us). When you’re operating the main control module, you are not allowed to abandon that post under any circumstances- it has to be manned at all times. \n\n\n\nOn this night in particular, I was working with my usual housing unit crew- we’ll call them Sanchez and Oswald- who were two very competent officers that I worked with every day, as we were all assigned to the housing unit. In addition, we had one other officer in the house this night, who we’ll refer to as Allen. Now, Allen was relatively new, so nobody expected him to be great at the job yet. My housing unit crew was always awesome about helping out new COs, which can be somewhat of a rarity. However, Allen had already earned a reputation for being obnoxious and trying to act like your stereotypical “tough guy” who never makes mistakes. The kind of know-it-all guy you can’t tell anything to because, “I already learned everything in the academy!” Right... \n\n\n\nAnyway, Allen and Sanchez were assigned to the wings this night, meaning that they were responsible for all the wing walks. Allen was pleased with this, because he downright REFUSED to man a control module, even though it’s required that everyone take turns with it. Yes, it’s painfully boring. Everyone wants to walk around, because being stuck in the bubble honestly sucks. But, that’s why we were all willing to share the responsibility. Except for Allen, that is, who had somehow gotten away with not doing that job up until this night. \n\n\n\nSo, unsurprisingly, Allan is doing an astronomical number of wing walks. Behaving like his usual macho, don’t-tell-me-how-to-do-my-job-even-though-I’ve-only-worked-here-for-a-month self out in the wings. Now, don’t get me wrong, nobody had any issue with the wing walks- the more wing presence, the safer everything should be, right? That’s what we all assumed. Little did we (or Allen, for that matter) realize that tonight was going to be his monumental screw up that finally convinced our supervisors that maybe it was time to make him man a control module after all. \n\n\n\nIt’s probably around 6 PM, and Sanchez decides to take a lunch break while Allen does another wing walk. Sanchez and I are sitting in the control module, casually chatting while he eats his salad and I type away at my chrono. All of a sudden, we hear screaming over the radio. Whoever it is, they’re repeatedly screaming the 10-code for “fight” at the top of their lungs. I just want to point out here that screaming into your radio is NEVER a good idea. Yes, it happens sometimes, but we are taught to speak clearly and calmly so other officers can understand what’s happening and respond to the correct location. Sanchez and I look at each other for a moment, before the person finally manages something like, “F-F-FIGHT! Three house! THREE HOUSE! FIGHT!” It was then that Sanchez and I both thought, “well, shit,” because we were in three house, and it was now obvious that the person screaming had to be Allen. Great!\n\n\n\nI stand up to look out the window over my computer, and sure enough there are two offenders fighting in D-wing, with Allen standing nearby looking horrified, just watching the fight. Sanchez immediately jumps up and bolts out the door and into D-wing (the door was right next to the control module, thankfully). I can hear him shouting, “Get on the ground!” as soon as he gets near the doorway, and both offenders immediately oblige. Oswald makes it into the wing not long after Sanchez, but the fight is over by then, and the offenders are escorted to the hole. \n\n\n\nNow, I’m sure you’re thinking that Allen’s monumental screw up that I mentioned earlier must be the fact that he screamed into his radio, while also letting two offenders fight right in front of him without doing anything, right? Well, you’re wrong. When the offenders who were fighting got down to the hole, someone inevitably asked one of them what the fight was about. The response was apparently, “Some dumb ass CO let that dude into my cell while I was at work! He robbed me, of course I’m gonna beat his ass!” Cue supervisors reviewing the cameras where, sure enough, they see Allen letting one offender involved in the fight into the other offender’s cell.\n\n\n\nThe supervisors, of course, decided to question Allen about the situation, who defensively told them that the offender had approached him saying that he had locked himself out of his cell, and needed to be let back in. Allen had then simply unlocked the door for him, without verifying that he actually lived there. The offender then proceeded to steal a ton of stuff from the cell, knowing that the offender who lived in it was at work. But, other offenders in the wing obviously saw this happening, and told the guy once he got back from work. The fight just so happened to be timed perfectly, since it kicked off while Allen was making his round in that wing. \n\n\n\nAllen, in true Allen fashion, refused to take any responsibility for his actions. All he got was a nicely-worded negative log note that basically said, “Don’t let this happen again, please!” and told that he finally had to start manning the control modules. Still, he sulked the rest of the night about how “stupid” it was that he “got in trouble,” and complained about it to anyone who would listen.\n\n\n\nI’m sure at least a few people here might be feeling sorry for Allen. How would he know not to just open the door? He was pretty new, after all. Well, the reality is that Allen WOULD have known what to do, if he would have just let someone show him. He prided himself so much on the fact that he “knew everything” about his job that he let it stop him from asking questions and learning the basics. Is a two-man fight in prison really that big of a deal? No, usually it’s not. But in reality, things can go bad fast. If we can avoid situations that compromise our safety by simply using our common sense and asking questions when we’re unsure about something or when we encounter a new situation, then that’s in everyone’s best interest. Asking questions doesn’t mean you’re incompetent, it means you actually care about doing your job well.\n\n\n\nAllen went to a different shift not too long after this incident, so I never really worked with him again. As far as I know, he’s still working there, and his attitude hasn’t changed much from what I’ve heard. Even if he still refuses to ask for help, I hope, at the very least, he’s realized that NOBODY knows everything, and maybe he’ll stop and think twice before acting in the future. \n\n\nEdit: formatting issue",

        "text": "So, I live in Canada. Lots of ice where I live right now. (When this happened a good 80% of our streets were sheets of ice.)\n\nI'm pulling up a hill. It's known for a little bit of speeding. Not really significant. It's usually only 5 KPH over. Maybe 10 on a fast day. The police around here don't mind so long as it's not dangerous, and traffic isn't being impeded by this. However, this one lady decided 55 KPH isn't fast enough for her today. I can clearly see her in my rear-view mirror speeding along with police lights following closely behind her. I'm leading my lane, and the guy beside me is also leading his lane. And she's trying to evade the police behind her. I'm in a small car (2014 Toyota Camry), but the guy beside me? Big provincial utility truck.\n\nShe's weaving in and out of traffic, something I don't like, and with the lights behind her, I can tell she's trying to run. She's still a good halfway down the hill when I decide to do something. I speed up and close the gap between the truck beside me. As she reaches me, she tried to merge, and quickly realized she couldn't go anywhere. I matched the speed of the truck, now beside me, and we were quickly coming up to a red light. Cops are still behind us, now seeing what we're doing. We (of course, lawfully!) stopped for the red light now upon us. And we sat there when it turn green. She had no where to go except to reverse down the hill. There was a median dividing the traffic going down the hill. Gave the cops time to pull her out of the vehicle. When she was out, we both left. No idea what she was running for, but she didn't get very far.\n\nNow, the one thing I didn't mention is that we have a friend in the police force. When I got home, he'd left a message thanking us for the help. The nearby highway would've extended the pursuit and involved the RCMP.",

        "text": "I thought I'd pass along two instances of traffic tickets when I was younger. I admit I did get my share of deserved speeding tickets. I'm older and wiser now.\n\nI was at a stoplight on a 4 lane divided State road with a 50 mph speed limit. Sitting on my Honda 400 motorcycle, I accelerated​ quickly from the light, banging through the gears. When I got 55 mph, I backed off and slowed to 50. I noticed a car accelerating very fast out of the pack behind me. Watching my mirrors, they came right up behind me. I'm thinking wtf, thier right on my rear\n\nI start accelerating to put some distance between us, but he kept right on me. As soon as I hit 60mph, he hit the lights and I got a very expensive ticket. In retrospect, I should have gotten a warning for excessive acceleration, not a speeding ticket.\n\nNext, I'm sitting at a left turn light on my motorcycle. Ahead of me is an unmarked police car. The officer is working on his laptop while the light is red. It changes to green and I wait, and wait. I tapped my horn the shortest amount of time possible. Just letting him know the light changed.\n\nHis head whips up and I see him give me the evil stinkeye look. He makes the turn and pulls over. As I pass him hit hits the lights. I pull right over, comply with his requests, not saying a thing. He eyeballs the motorcycle and heads back to the car.\n\nA few minutes later, he hands me my license and registration. He then says \" Radar detectors are illegal in CT\" and hands me a ticket. Saying have a good day, he turns and walks away.\n\nI do not dispute the illegal radar detector, but to pull me over and search for something to nail me for.... Just for tapping my horn, not right.\n\nThe next one scared the piss out of me but I got lucky. Going down a 2 lane State road with a 45mph limit. I'm behind a car going 40 and decide to pass in a passing zone. I put my turn signal on, drop a gear, accelerate to 65 as I'm passing. I hit the right turn signal as I look in the mirror to make sure I'm clear. In my mirror, it is filled with a view of a town police car right behind me. I instantly get a metallic taste in my mouth and think wtf. I pull back into the lane, making sure there is room for the police car behind me. He followed me for 2 miles while I drove exactly 45mph. He finally pulled off. Thank you officer, I got the message.\n\nI've learned a lot since then. Almost everybody speeds. Law enforcement is like a predator watching a herd of animals. They are looking for someone who stands out. Changing lanes, frequent brake lights, passing other cars by more than 5mph, in general, any type of aggressive driving. Tagged, your it. I have no problems with law personnel. Their people doing thier job by enforcing the law. It's a mostly thankless job. So thank you for giving me tickets that I truly deserved for being an idiot. I learned to stop being stupid and only had one ticket in the past 30 years.",

        "text": "I was working day shift in a rural county, and partnered up with another Trooper due to a car shortage.\n\nWe came to a stop at a 3-way intersection, and a car on my right clearly reached the intersection before me. He was stopped for a solid second or two before I was, and he was on my right. That gave him the right-of-way, so I paused. He waved me to go. I waved back, to gesture he was first and he should go. He waved me to go again. Oh no no no, someone who that adamantly does not want me behind them is definitely someone I was going to drive behind. So I waited.\n\nHe finally went. I got behind him. His registration was expired, but not by much. Then my partner ran his plate, and it came back years expired even though the stickers were showing a couple months expired. It had a fake sticker, which could mean jail time depending on how slow the day was going. At the next turn, he made a right. So I stopped him.\n\n\"Good afternoon, the reason I stopped you is because your registration appears to be expired.\" And by this point I knew it didn't just appear to be, it was expired, and he tried to hide it by committing fraud. But we play the game.\n\n\"Ahhh, yeah, I know...I, gosh, yeah, I'm trying to fix it.\"\n\n\"Is that why you didn't want me behind you at the stop sign?\" I was getting weird signals from this guy.\n\n\"Yeah, I thought you'd see it and pull me over, gosh dang it, I should've just kept going.\"\n\n\"I also noticed it's showing it expired this year, but the computer was telling me it expired two years ago. When did you decide to put the fake sticker on?\"\n\n\"That....wasn't me, it was how I bought it...but I left it on there.\"\n\n\"I'll need to see your driver's license.\" He was making jerky movements and rambling on. He mentioned he was coming back from the grocery store, and his grocery bags confirmed that.\n\n\"Yeah, lemme just get that. Whooo!\" He let out a big exhale. \"I'm really nervous man. I actually have anxiety, I'm not on anything.\"\n\n\"Do you take anything for it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I haven't taken it in a couple days.\" He handed me his drivers license.\n\n\"Is this valid?\"\n\n\"I think so, yeah.\"\n\n\"Okay. Hand me the keys, wait in the car.\" He did. At this point I already knew he wasn't going to be driving away.\n\nI ran some checks on him. No warrants, a history of drug use, three driver's license suspensions that were current, three additional suspensions that had expired, and no valid license.\n\nI spoke to my partner, \"This guy is definitely going to jail for one thing, I'm going to get him out of the car, do some sobriety tests, and see if he's going for a few things.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm going to ask you to step out of the car for me so I can do some tests and make sure you're safe to drive.\"\n\n\"Alright man, yeah, sure, no problem, I'm not on anything.\"\n\nI asked some questions, he did some tests, and this is the part everyone on Reddit gets wrong: he did great. I determined he wasn't under the influence of anything. He was then placed under arrest for all the license suspensions and the fake sticker.\n\n\"You're being placed under arrest, not for DWI because I don't think you're under the influence of anything, but for the sticker and suspended license.\"\n\n\"Oh wow, I didn't even know I could go to jail for that. If I knew that I wouldn't be driving.\"\n\nI let someone come and pick up his groceries. I'm not heartless.",

        "text": "Since the beginning of my law enforcement career, I've always wanted to challenge myself and be proactive with my cases. During my patrol time, I found that many officers weren't interested in conduct DUI stops, so I challenged myself to knock down vehicles and find the drunks. The command staff were impressed with the result and I found myself with a shiny, gold detective badge in a few short years.\n\nSoon after getting situated in my cubicle, I knew that I'd have to find another niche within this division. The days of chasing drunks were over for me, but there were endless opportunities now to find proactive cases.\n\nIt wasn't long until the most challenging type of investigation landed at my feet. A few months into being in the division, I was contacted by the feds and they requested assistance with an investigation involving child pornography. Up until then, I didn't even know that this type of crime was so heinous and wide-spread. I've known that there were incidents of high school kids sending pictures of themselves on Snapchat that was labeled as child pornography, but this was a whole new level of evil.\n\nAfter closing that first child pornography investigation, I had finally found a niche where I could arrest the most vile suspects and attempt to help and locate child victims. It wasn't until I began working proactive cases on the internet that I found that our society is filled with despicable individuals. I began downloading and viewing videos that were being shared on the internet that no one in their right mind would want to view. There were people in this world that would videotape themselves sexually and physically abusing infants, toddlers and small children for the sexual arousal of strangers on the internet! My head was spinning. I was reviewing images and videos of children that I knew would be psychologically scarred for their rest of their lives. \n\nAnd the worst part? \n\nThese movies were filmed years ago and many of my sources tell me that these children were never saved.\n\nAs I began executing search warrants at residences, I found that these suspects were all part of a certain breed of people that I'll never understand. These were seemingly \"normal\" people that were incredibly nice during our interviews. Never arguing and never rude. It was almost like being in my own \"To Catch A Predator\" episode as they explain how they were sexually aroused while watching videos that I later have nightmares about.\n\nWill any of my arrests make a real impact? Probably not, but the satisfaction of knocking on a suspect's door in the early morning hours and flipping their world upside down is a small step in the right direction. I'm hoping that this post will open up some people's eyes that might be involved in this filth and realize that I could come knocking.\n\n",

        "text": "I was working in a major metropolitan area, heading eastbound on a freeway. Traffic heading westbound was at almost a complete standstill just from the regular commute. Like most major freeways, the eastbound and westbound lanes were separated by a concrete wall. At this spot, there was a gap in the wall big enough for a car to fit through. I regularly used it while responding to emergency calls.\n\nI just happened to be in the right spot as I saw a car from the westbound lane drive into the center divide and make a u-turn through the gap. I pulled behind him and turned on my lights, and he stopped where he was.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir. I stopped you for making a u-turn in the center divide. I'm not sure which law you broke, but I'm going to look it up, and once I find it, you're going to get a ticket.\"\n\nThe law doesn't require I know which law he broke, or that I know that he broke a law. The law just requires it be reasonable for me to believe that a law was broken. And it's pretty reasonable that you can't make a u-turn through a gap on the freeway that separated 10 lanes.\n\nIf you think about it, that makes sense. There are a number of laws that can be broken if you have a specific exemption. It would be impossible for me to know if you have that exemption unless I stopped you and asked.\n\nAs it turned out, four laws applied to what he did, and he got a ticket for one of them.",

LEOs were ahead of us anyway as they were dispatched first.  \nwe arrived, LEO onscene direct us to this double wide on a property at the address (junkyard all around it, complete with about 17 cars in various states of ......\"repair\") were we find a young gentleman who happens to be bleeding from a through and through in his left calf.  like the perfect place to shoot yourself and not do major damage.  (well...I mean I guess its all relative depending on the person......nevermind)  He is quite animated and upset with himself, his story was that he heard a noise outside as if someone had been walking around his property.  Fearing that he was about to be robbed, our hero armed himself with his trusty .45 and went out to \"do a patrol\".   this went well.  discovering no one, her came back inside.  apparently distracted while browsing a rather NSFW reddit, he failed to notice his cat.   the unfortunate and unsuspecting feline apparently desired a fresh bowl of meow mix and as cats will, expressed this desire to our hero by rubbing himself along his legs.   Too involved in his......redditing.....our hero tripped over his cat and (I'm only guessing here) fired his weapon in self defense.  (or by mistake)  wounding himself and costing the poor feline about 4 lives.  (missed the cat)  \nthe person he was yelling at over the phone that the dispatcher heard was the poor cat.  \nSo while we are tending to his wounds and laughing at him,  (ok with him) his brother walks into the house (BTW house is a relative term, dump is more descriptive.)  and announces that he was at the property earlier this evening and was attempting to knock at the door and upon not receiving an answer her proceeded to walk around to the back door and try to gain entry.   realizing he could have shot his own brother, the patient then verbally unloaded on him.  This caused the cops from outside to come back in.  (in my experience, LEO's become attracted to raised voices)  Well, at that moment, the cat decided he was going to make a break for it from under a couch near the front door.  the stars aligned, a deputy stepped into the door, sees the cat and moves to avoid him while trying to run in and address the yelling situation and fails his dexterity check, tripping over the cat, punting the poor furry beast back under the couch (another 2 lives) and falling like a tree onto the floor with a crash.   (his weapon did NOT discharge on account of the cat, most likely due to his knowledge of firearms and safeties.)  realizing the situation was not as bad as it sounded, his fellow officers proceeded to pick him up off the floor.  inquires about balance and inibritiation levels were inquired of the officer by his mates.  patient was transported for a GSW and advised to take a class on gun safety.  the cat declined transport.  the deputy will likely never live this one down.   \n\nthe morale of the story kids:  be aware of furry speed bumps.\n\n\nTDLR: unsmart citizen attempts to break into his brothers shabby double wide but fails to announce himself, brother checks the property line, finds no one, trips over cat and shoots self.  cat then trips deputy, who will likely hear about this for the remainder of his career.\n\n\nPS: Thanks for letting a hose dragger post here, we don't seem to have our own active sub.",

        "text": "I was reminded of this story after seeing one of the deputies involved at a dui checkpoint last night (New Years Eve, I was the designated driver) about 2 years ago I was not in fact sober, sitting on a bench in my towns bar district waiting for the uber to show up. Please forgive me if my terminology or anything is wrong. I’m not law enforcement affiliated other than the fact that a lot of them get their boats worked on at my shop.  As an aside, our sheriffs are amazing, just the right mix of old time toughness and modern professional techniques to keep our county’s unique mix of populations in harmony\n\nThis occurred during the holidays, so the area was full of college kids home on break. To the townies this meant hot college babes about and in need of their particular brand of loving, which was usually rebuffed with cruel laughter and snark. Well I guess this one particular example of rock bottom Romeo had made a deep fried ass of himself to the point the bouncers had called the sheriffs and heaved him by his saggy pants from the bar.\n\nThe previous part of the story is mostly educated assumption. This is where my observation of the event starts. \n\nTwo deputies had come looking for Romeo based on the fact that a neck tatt and the physical description the bouncers had provided matched that of a gent they wanted to chat with about some trailer park arson. They caught up with him 10 feet from the bench I was sitting on waiting for that damn uber. The two deputies were a very senior deputy (let’s call him sergeant fishy) and the  rookie he was working with that night. I know Sergeant Fishy because he brings his skiff to us for electronics work ( he’s a big fella who doesn’t quite fit in small compartments to do wiring). The deputies approached facing me. Romeo had his back to me. I recognized Fishy, made a “you want me to leave” motion and was given a “nah stay put don’t worry about it” gesture. So I stayed and enjoyed the show. \n\nFishy began to chat with Romeo, starting with the bar incident ( the bouncers were haters cause Romeo had so much game) and then moved slowly into the real reason they were chatting with him (burned single wides) at which point Romeo started getting antsy, with Fishy repeatedly telling him to relax we are just chatting in a calm and steady tone. \n\nThrough all this the rookie was quietly watching the exchange, following the lead of Fishy. The conversation escalated to a point where Fishy knew he had his man, and Romeo knew had had let slip some detail he shouldn’t have. So he proceeded to start screaming obscenities and ranting about evil cops, rich people, and several other hot button issues. Midway through his tirade Romeo went to punctuate his argument by poking Fishy in the chest.  Big mistake. Before Fishy could even start to move to grab Romeo, the average height, average build, average appearing in every way rookie had Romeo restrained and was informing him of how poorly he was behaving and what was going to happen because of it, in a tone I can only describe as an angry growl reminiscent of a big block through open headers. The look of pride on Fishy’s face was something like I’d  only seen on my own father’s face the day I graduated college. They drug his butt off to their cruiser right as my uber showed up. I won’t say I was in awe but I was impressed. \n\nFishy was in the shop some time later. He never liked to talk much about work, but did tell me Romeo got locked up for torching the trailers. He apparently got the maximum because he got fresh with the female judge. Fishy is set to retire soon and that rookie was running the checkpoint with a calm cool hand like I had seen fishy display two years ago. I guess he had a good example. \n\nAlso, I call him sergeant fishy because he was a whole lot better at catching criminals than he was fish. Comically so. \n\nTl;Dr. Rookie handles a moron in decisive professional manner in front of a proud mentor. ",

        "text": "In the city I work in, a lot of people couldn't afford to set off fireworks for the new year. But they could afford to shoot bullets into the air from the guns they had stolen. As a result, our customary tradition was to park under a freeway overpass and wait for the bullets to finish dropping. I wish I was kidding.\n\nIt was nearly midnight, and I was partnered with Johnson. I was driving that day. Another car was out at a crash, and we were looking for a good place to park.\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, are you available for a crash? Unit 3 is tied up on another one.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, go ahead.\" Non injury crash, blocking some lanes. We went en route. A few seconds after getting the call, we spotted a car weaving pretty badly, crossing almost fully into adjacent lanes. I pulled in behind it to watch it. I could see the side mirrors were broken, and barely hanging on to the car. \n\nI told Johnson, \"I think we're going to have to stop this car.\"\n\nJohnson relayed that to Dispatch, \"Unit 2, we're diverting for a stop, northbound 87 at 60th.\"\n\nI turned on the emergency lights, and the car started slowing down and drifting to the right. We came up to the 60th exit...and passed it. Okay, we'll try the next one. We passed the next exit. Johnson went over the megaphone, \"Pull over. Pull over. Pull over.\"\n\nThe driver made a lane change to the left and punched it. Johnson asked me, \"Failure to yield?\"\nI confirmed, \"Failure to yield.\"\n\nJohnson notified dispatch, \"Unit 2, failure to yield. Northbound 87 passing 35th. Black Ford sedan. Original want was DUI. Light traffic. Vehicle is in the...\" Johnson paused as the vehicle drifted across all four lanes, back and forth. Our heads drifted left and right in unison as we watched it in front of us. Johnson continued, \"Vehicle is all over the road. The driver also appears to be throwing things out the window.\" Never figured out what that was, but the guess was drugs.\n\nWe approached another exit, and the driver put their foot to the floor on the brake pedal. The car didn't have ABS, so all the tires locked and filled the road with smoke. At the last second, the driver released the brakes and took the exit. We followed.\n\n\"Unit 2, exited at 10th. Just blew a red light! Continuing north on...\" Johnson looked for a street sign. I helped him, \"Miller Street.\"\n\n\"Continuing north on Miller Street.\" Our K-9 unit was set up there, and jumped into the pursuit behind us. \"Speeds at 70mph, continuing on Miller...taking the on ramp, back northbound on 87.\"\n\nLights flashing, sirens blaring, and six more patrol cars converging on our location. We got back on the freeway at a busier area, and we had to start dodging traffic. We passed a few more exits, until the driver tried another brake-lock-exit-dive attempt, which didn't come close to working. \n\n\"Heading down the frontage road. Just blew a stop sign...and another...and another.\" We crested a hill when suddenly the car disappeared in a puff of smoke. \"TC TC!\" Short for traffic collision.\n\nWe stopped near the hill and ran to the edge with our guns drawn, aimed down but ready. As we looked over the edge, we saw...nothing. No car. It led to a bicycle path. As we headed that way, a guy came around the corner, walking his dog. He told us, \"Hey, there's a guy down there with no pants on.\" \n\nA couple seconds later, we found Mr. Pantsless. We had him lay on the ground, and he complied with all our commands. As Johnson went to go handcuff him, Johnson slipped and sliced his hand. Johnson recovered, and got the suspect in cuffs.\n\nAs I spoke with the suspect, he was obviously high, probably from cocaine. He ended up having a warrant for some sex crimes. He had also just done a pantsless run through some shrubs, which led to multiple cuts. Combine Johnson's cut and the suspects cuts, and Johnson got a ride to the hospital for exposure, plus a year of testing for communicable diseases.\n\nI transported Mr. Pantsless to the hospital, then the local jail. The local jail took one look at him and said, \"We're not taking him. He's too high.\" I then transported him to the county jail, which isn't allowed to deny prisoners.\n\nFinal charges were DUI, being under the influence of a prohibited substance, driving on a suspended license, felony evading, and littering. Mr. Pantsless took a plea deal, got probation, and was back on the street two weeks later.\n\nWhile we were in pursuit, it went past midnight. I forever remember that as the night I pursued into the new year. ",

        "text": "I'm in a densely populated, sprawling part of the USA where being county law enforcement means you can run calls on barren highways, dense public housing mazes, meth trailers, and wealthy suburban neighborhoods all in one shift. We have dozens of different layers of emergency services depending on where you are in the county, with all kinds of municipalities and ESDs making a crazy patchwork on the map. Being the one and only Sheriff's Office means getting to go everywhere and see it all. You quickly learn that just like police departments, not all EMS agencies and fire departments are created equal.\n\nI pick up an FSGI (hit and run crash) on a multi-lane highway in a heavily traveled and populated part of the district that is Dr. Jekyll during the day and Mr. Hyde at night. It's about 0300. A vehicle was struck on the highway and chased the vehicle that hit it, and both vehicles have stopped in the parking lot of a Goodwill store. During the day, a hit and run with the complainant chasing the suspect usually results in an exchange of insurance info; during the night, this usually results in a fight or shooting, so I hustled on over to keep things from getting violent.\n\nI enter the parking lot to find an ambulance of the local fire department parked behind a small pickup truck. This particular FD has run this section of town for decades and their people are very competent and know how to run calls in the hood. They usually run their boxes with a paramedic in charge and an EMT-B or -A assisting. Whoever's most awake at the time gets to drive. I assumed they were flagged down due to the crash. I approach the left side and see a salty old paramedic/firefighter standing with his foot resting on the back of a young man who is laying face down on the pavement. Both are looking up at me and the man on the pavement seems highly amused (and intoxicated). He has a black eye. The rookie EMT-B is standing nearby looking kind of shocked.\n\nI open with my standard citizen contact greeting: \"Evening, I'm Deputy Ausare117 with the Sheriff's Office, and just what the hell is going on here?\"\n\nThe paramedic was driving the ambulance with the EMT-B riding when the pickup drove out of its lane and struck the side of the ambulance. The pickup then took off. The experienced (and insane) paramedic turned on his lights and sirens and chased the pickup. In an ambulance. He explains calmly that he chased the pickup to the parking lot and cornered it, then put the ambulance in park. He then got out to meet with the driver of the pickup. The pickup driver got out and approached the para with his fists raised in a threatening manner. He then became very sleepy and laid down on the pavement for a nap. The para concluded that the black eye on the pickup guy was sustained during the crash due to failure to use a seat belt. He further surmised that the pickup guy possibly thought the ambulance was a police car (gee, what would make him think that?) and upon meeting them face-to-face was too drunk to tell EMS uniforms from police uniforms.\n\nSeems legit to me. Pickup guy went to jail for driving while intoxicated and failure to stop and give information. He had only been living in town for a few weeks, and sure enough was confused by the uniforms. He seemed, if anything, rueful about the incident, as though he had learned from his mistakes, and indeed learned an important lesson about his new home. Our community has lots of different emergency service agencies, some who enforce laws, some who put out fires and rescue trapped victims, and some who heal and save the injured. But there's one thing the uniformed services all share in common, and that's bringing safety to our community - and administering the occasional ass beating.\n\nTL;DR Don't pick fights with uniformed personnel where I live, the paramedics are just as likely to whoop your ass as the cops.",

Apparently, a bunch of upper management has been driving through the area, and word gets back to the commander when they see you out of policy.\n\nFirst thing: if you're wearing your jacket, you have to have your tie on.\" Groans throughout the briefing room. But we're state police; our uniforms are iconic. Go back 100 years, and the only difference you'd see would be the guns we carry. And our uniforms are expensive, paid for out of our own paycheck.

If you don't have that hood on, you can't wear the cap.\"\n\nA salty senior from the back chirped up, \"You've got to be shitting me. Of *course*, management in all their wisdom. I can just imagine that meeting. 'If you're covering your head, you can cover your head. But if you're not covering your head?

        "text": "So when a 2 lane mountain pass highway comes through your district, you're gonna get a lot of MVCs. Both major and minor.    So we get to know the local staters pretty well.   And sometimes they come up with funnies.   For example:\nThe scene: early fall, 0300 get dispatched for a head on.  2 cars.\nArrive to find 2000's Jeep liberty that t-boned a GMC pickup.  Heavy damage but nobody in the liberty.  Notice sobbing group of teenage girls (oh Happy day) on side of highway (highway going through a town).   See one of them literally loosing her mind like someone told her the world is ending.  The other two are following suit but with less....vigor.   there's 2 dudes standing next to their busted truck a little ways down the road.   \n\nSo we are first in, LE is kinda spread out where we work and the staters run the highways anyways so I think like 1 runs this highway in particular at night.  I tell my partner (S) that I'm going to triage the liberty, he could check the truck.  (Yes I jumped on this grenade).  It goes as expected.  \"Hi I'm with the fire department, are you hurt?\". Now, most people answer appropriately.   Not this gaggle of distraught teenyboppers.   One's sobbing so hard I take a long look at her to make sure she's not injured in some way I can't see.  (This will play in later). The other two are sobbing half as much.  So I invite everyone to the aid car.  \nIt was literally like herding cats across an interstate, only smaller scale and dumber cats.  Finally got them all together in the box.  The initial story I get is that teen A (the one heralding the Earth's doom) was driving, teens B and C were in back.  Teen A had just stolen mom's liberty and when asked about drinking and driving teen A suddenly increased her freak out to an unholy level.  \"Mom's going to kill me\" and such.  I'm getting nowhere.\n\nSo right about now my door opens, in pops the deputy and I fill him in.  He wants to know if there was drinking, teen A says she had a \"small sip\" and continues her wailing.   At this point I'm trying to evaluate all three girls at once so we can get wavers signed by parents (minors) and send everyone to get grounded by parents.    So I'm hearing what deputy is saying to teen A and keeping my ear on it while I check teens b and c.  \nHe starts talking to her in a calm and buddy like fashion, getting mom's number, her name and address and bday and what happened out of her eventually.  (Love it when LE gets that stuff for me). He thanks her, tells her he will be right back and steps out.  Then Teen A's mom shows up.  Crying starts again.  Imagine a cat being run across an un-tuned violin.  Deputy comes back, pulls out breathalyzer, teen A blows a .09.    from a sip.  SMH.  \nSo deputy looks at her, steps out, comes back, pulls out cuffs and tells teen A this: \n\"well you made the big girl decisions so now it's time to face the big girl consequences.   Time to buck the fuck up and get locked up.\".  The look on her face hearing that from someone she thought was her buddy..... priceless.   \nTDLR: deputy played good cop, bad cop all by himself.  \n\nThanks for all you do coppers!",

Instead, we get really slow cars and essentially keep the pedal to the floor as we take 10 seconds to reach 60mph. But we do what we can with what we have.\n\nThe Crown Vics were rear wheel drive. That meant any time it rained, there was a bit of sliding around. Sometimes it was unintentional. Sometimes.\n\nI was working on a rainy day and I had a new dispatcher riding along with me. I told her it'd probably be a boring day since we'd only be responding to crashes. Early in the day, we had a crash in a bad spot on the freeway, with another Trooper already on scene while I was still responding.\n\n\"I need another unit to stop traffic, quickly.\" He said that in radio code. \n\n\"Unit 2 en route.\" So off I went. A Trooper asking for that in the way he did is basically one step shy of an \"Officer Down\" call, so it required a quick response.\n\nThis time I was driving an all wheel drive Ford Explorer. \"These cars have traction control, both for cornering and acceleration. They're impossible to slide.\" That's what we were told when we got them. Hah.\n\nI exited the freeway and jumped back on going the other direction. Since I was in a hurry, I gave it some gas, and obviously by \"some\" I mean I pushed the pedal to the floor.\n\nThe rear of the car kicked out sideways, and my ride-along grabbed the door to hang on. Huh, they told me that wasn't possible. I stayed on the gas and the front tires broke loose as well. I found myself in an all-wheel drift...which was clearly impossible based on what I had been trained. But they taught us to drive well, so I continued on with no problem. \n\nI merged onto the freeway and reached a transition road with a curve in it. I had a bit more speed at this point, and the same thing happened. No big deal...to me. The ride-along wasn't having any of it, though. I imagine she thought she'd be beside a desk, in a safe, warm office, and not actually in any sort of danger. I imagine that's why dispatchers are required to do ride-alongs; so they understand the risk is real.\n\nWe went to a few other crashes throughout the day. The ride-along stayed in the car the whole time, seatbelt on. And I learned the limits of the safety feature.",

We all sat around, bought between a half-ounce or an ounce each, had fun, partied, smoked out, and we were planning on going to the bar for some drinks when...\n\n...we walk down the hall, and my friend L.B. opens the door, just as New York's Finest is raising their hand to knock.  We're standing there, paralyzed, face-to-face with New York cops.\n\nThese cops don't need a warrant to search the house, since the door has been opened for them, and we're all dumb college freshman carrying bush-league drugs in our pockets.\n\nThese cops instantly walk in and start lining us up, taking our ID's and asking where we're from, what we're we're doing in this place...\n\n(Bear in mind, in this particular place, we were visiting a pot dealer.  The room we had just walked out of, there was a coffee table with a half-pound of weed sitting openly, scales for measuring weed,  rolling papers, pipes, bongs, blunts already rolled, blunts ready to be rolled, money on the table, half-a-dozen college freshman lined up with a half-ounce each on their way out, everything you could want for a trafficking conviction...\n\nWe were literally pissing our pants.  I was thinking, \"oh shit oh shit I'm gonna have to call my mom from Ryker's Island oh motherfucker I'm going to jail and have to deal with a bunch of hardcore New York criminals motherfucker oh shit oh shit oh shit!\"\n\nIt turns out, the cops were looking for a roommate of the guy we had just visited.  He had gotten in a barfight the night before, they were looking for him on assault.  They saw the weed, they saw the scared college kids, and correctly deduced: \"Get the fuck back to your dorm!  Don't come here again!\"\n\nNYPD did a good job, and I respect them, because they had a sense of discretion.  Dude that committed a violent act= suspect for assault.

Mainly we handle all the hot calls for the district. I'm eating a steak burrito with extra guacamole while Joe eats a Jimmy John sandwich number 9 with extra hot peppers. \n\nWe are sitting in an empty parking lot talking about my dating life. Joe loves talking about my dating life, I'm more meh about it, but Joe's recently married and loves asking me how my tinder dates are going, I tell him about the date I had a few weekends ago, she was nice and cute, but we didn't click. Joe, in between bites, \"Ahh she messed up, you’re a catch, not a big tuna I'd take a picture with but one I'd definitely eat out of a can.\" I look at Joe and I'm thinking of a response, but once again Joe has gotten me slightly stumped. \n\n[Dispatch] BEEP: Code 2, shots fired in a park.\n\nI'm riding shotgun, so I key up, \"Unit 318, drop the code 2, make our last gone on arrival.\" I have a third of burrito left so I decide to place it back in the foil and place it neatly in my cup holder. I take a big swig of water and look at Joe, he sighs and finishes his sandwich with two very large bites. \n\nMouth still full, Joe calmly states, \"What are you going to do after shift, I'd grab a beer with you but I'm working overtime.\" \n\n\"That's a good question, probably make some diner and play Fifa.\"\n\nJoe gets to play the radio today, we listen to some 80’s rock band, lights and sirens on our way to the shots fired. \n\nJoe kills the lights and sirens as we approach the park. It's a large park and we go around the back, we have a had a few calls in the last few months, none of them have resulted in anything. As we approach a basketball court, I see a vehicle parked, the passenger side looks shot-out. I tell Joe, and we stop and park the vehicle. \n\nJoe and I both get our long guns out and approach the vehicle quietly on foot, the vehicle was parked on the side of the basketball park on the grass. I see some movement, and observe the window not to be shot out but to have some condensation, I relay that the window isn't shot out to Joe. \n\nI yell out, \"Police! Show me your hands, now!\" Joe turns on his flash light on his weapon and points it at the vehicle. I yell several more times, but I just see quick movement in the vehicle. I approach from the rear passenger side. I'm very angry now, I scream this time, extremely loudly, my loudest setting, \"SHOW ME YOUR HANDS NOW, THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING!\" \n\nI see two hands come out of the vehicle. I look in and see two young teenagers in the vehicle, with their pants down scared and steam on the windows. I look at Joe and put four fingers in the air. Feeling the stress leave me, I see the kids face, completely caught in the lights like a deer. Joe key's up, \"Dispatch, Code 4, any other calls of shots fired?\" He winks at me while he says it, slaying me with the last line. \n\n\"Passenger side, come out, miss stay in the vehicle till that Officer asks you to exit,\" I say quite calmly. I explain to the kid with his boxers on why I'm here. He thought his girlfriend's dad had found them, he's a cop. I know the guy, he's an asshole, he was one of my field instructors.\n\nI tell the kid to come to the rear of the vehicle, Joe talks to the girl. I look at the kid and ask him if he heard any gun shots in the last ten minutes. He says no still shaking, his adrenaline is still pumping, to help calm him down I tell him to slow his breathing. \n\nI go and talk to Joe and he responds with, \"She's fine, you know..., but do you know who her dad is?\" I shake my head yes, he then blurts out the officer's name. I look down at his body worn camera, and shake my head. Our sergeant is friends with that cop. I look at Joe and he realizes his mistake, and asks the girl if her dad knows that she has a boyfriend, she says no. \n\nWe let both kids get back in the vehicle and watch them leave the park. I kill my camera as does Joe. Joe looks at me and laughs, “Well we just watched a kid’s funeral, you know, after sergeant see’s the video. She told me Sergeant D was like an uncle to her growing up.” I shake my head and and walk back to my burrito. ",

I never went through basic training, so I asked the Air Force, Army, and Marine guys in my academy how it compared. They all said, \"This is way worse.\"\n\nWe, as cadets, worked out a minimum of three times a week with Troopers leading the workouts. These Troopers were gods (and goddesses) even among athletes. One of the instructors told us he was recovering from a hangover and a cold, and he made it look like a Sunday stroll while cadets were collapsing from exhaustion. Historically, cadets had died from over-exertion (but that was rare). Each workout started around 0500 hours and typically ended at 0630...if you were a fast runner, maybe 0650 if you were slow. Breakfast was at 0700, so there was motivation to run faster. \n\nThe workout was roughly 20 minutes of non-stop floor exercises, then pull ups, followed by a run. Floor exercises included a variety of push ups, sit ups, squats, jumping jacks, and lunges. It was all endurance building body-weight stuff. We counted each rep out loud. As we did more and more reps, people would lose count, and we'd start back over at zero. Those 40 pushups you just did? We're back at zero.\n\nOne day, we did lunges in a line as a \"team building exercise.\" We did them with our arms across each other's shoulders, down together, and up together. We did them the length of a football field...and back...twice. Knowing our legs would be sore the next day, our workout the next day was squats and lunges.\n\n\"Down, up!\" The instructor would yell. \"ONE!\" We would count. \"Down, up, TWO!\" We did about 100, then switched to push ups. We did 10 of those, and back to squats. Another 100 squats. 10 more push ups.\n\nThe instructor called out to one of the cadets.\n\n\"Cadet Brown!\"\n\n\"Sir, Cadet Brown!\"\n\n\"Cadet Brown, what do you think the next exercise will be?\"\n\nI don't know why Cadet Brown said what he said,  but I've got some theories. \"Sir, Cadet Brown...sit ups?\"\n\nThe instructor broke into laughter. \"Sit ups?! Why do you think we would do sit ups?!\"\n\n\"Sir, Cadet Brown, to have a well rounded workout!\"\n\n\"No, Brown, we're not doing sit ups. Cadet Chan! What's the next exercise?\"\n\n\"Sir, Cadet Chan, squats!\"\n\n\"Right you are Chan! Squat position, move! Down! Up!\"\n\n\"ONE!\"\n\nThat's not even the story. That's the intro.\n\nThe academy liked to rotate instructors regularly. It kept them up on their road skills, and made sure they didn't get disconnected from their primary duties. This was also true of the physical training staff. Every so often, another Trooper would try out for the position and they'd have to lead a workout. Those were the best days. Towards the end of the academy, the cadets were in better shape than the instructors trying to get the job (but still no match for the regular Instructors). Except this one guy who got the job.\n\nHis name, for the purposes of this story, will be Trooper Lightning. He came in and we were expecting an easy workout. The squats workout was an outlier; it was normally a good variety of upper body, lower body, and abdominal exercises. Not with Trooper Lightning at the helm of our nightmare ship.\n\n\"Leg lifts, move! Down, up!\" \"ONE!\" Over, and over, and over again. He did over four hundred. I say he did because I didn't, and I don't think anyone else did, and we had former professional athletes in our class. But Lightning did every single one. We switched, ten pushups, back to leg lifts. He did another two hundred. And it went like this for 20 minutes. I have no idea what the final count was at the end, but I was convinced his legs were tied to a string on the ceiling and someone was pulling them up.\n\nThen the run came. We did 9 miles that day. We always ran at the pace of the instructor. Slower people would get dropped, and the only punishment was less time to eat. Our fastest person carried our cadet flag. Earlier, we did a one mile run, and our fastest guy did it in 4:45. No Olympian, but darn good. I was happy with my 5:55 mile. \n\nAt the end of that 9 mile run, only the flag carrier was still with Trooper Lightning. They averaged a 5:25 mile over 9 miles.\n\nYears later, cadets would come out of the academy to the office I worked at. Any time physical training was brought up, they'd say, \"Were you there when Trooper Lightning was there? Those days were the worst!\" Yes, yes they were.",

As I was watching traffic, I saw a cop car approaching me with his lights and sirens going. As he got closer, I saw he was from the next city over, and outside of his typical jurisdiction. He passed me, and I saw a regular car in front of him, making multiple lane changes...left and right. \n\n...pursuit?\n\nI threw my sandwich down and punched it after him.\n\n\"Unit 2 to dispatch...is Salem PD in pursuit?\"\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, we just got that call. They're chasing a stolen vehicle and requesting State Police take over.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, I copy. They just passed my location.

I was probably a mile behind them as I barely caught them taking a transition to another freeway. I notified dispatch. Just after the transition, they took an exit. I was probably 10 seconds behind them now. \n\nA left turn, a right turn, as I'm calling out streets we're on. \"River Street at River Ave.\" Thanks, city planners. \"Right onto Lake Street. Left onto Washington Ave.\" \n\nA sergeant came over the air, \"Is Unit 2 in pursuit?\"\n\nDispatch to the sergeant, \"Uh...I'm not really sure. Unit 2?\"\n\nI was about 4 seconds behind at this point. See, if we're in pursuit, the sergeant has to do a bunch of paperwork. But if we never actually catch up? No paper. \"Negative, not in pursuit, still trying to catch up.\"\n\nThe sergeant again, \"I copy. Unit 2, break off. Notify the local PD.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, I copy, cancelling. Suspect vehicle and Salem PD last seen on Parallel Drive.\n\nI drove back to my original spot. As I did, I passed the Salem PD car that had been in pursuit.

        "text": "Patrolling on day shift, when a local crackhead is noticed walking up one of our main streets with a lot of motels that shit bags stay at, because they’re cheap and it’s some where they can do drugs. \n\nWhilst doing multiple runs on 2 (main road), R (local drunk/crack head) is walking down the street and she is known to be drunk, high, or have a warrant out for her arrest. Keep in mind R is a disgusting homeless female. When I say disgusting, i’m talking it’s easier to list off the diseases she doesn’t have versus the ones she does, which the only one that could be thought of that she doesn’t have is AIDs. She usually has bugs crawling around in her hair and smells like 12 pounds of water buffalo shit, but we lucked out this time as she had just gotten out of jail a couple days before and was somewhat sober. \n\nMy partner (61) and I decide to make contact with her to see if she has warrants or if we can take her to detox as she’ll usually start harassing people or try to shoplift gold spray paint or oven cleaner from the hardware store. \n\nUpon approaching her, we get consent to talk to her and I instantly throw on two pairs of gloves. She recognizes my partner and I and calls us by our name and greets us with a nice “Hello wonderful Officers of the Law”. \n\nWe sit her down on the sidewalk in front of a Chinese food restaurant that sells their by the scoop for a dollar. \n\nI get her ID from her and clear her via dispatch, she comes back clear, no warrants. She explains to us she just got out of jail a couple days ago for a Domestic Violence charge. \n\nWe can sense that she has something in her system, turns out it’s only alcohol. We contact Detox to make a reservation to take her there so she can sober up. \n\nThe workers at Detox inform us that she has used her reservation for the month. You know that there’s probably an issue when she can only go to detox once a month because she becomes belligerent with the workers or other people trying to sober up. Detox informs us we can take her to another location, but the other location is 45 minutes to an hour away, and there’s no way the sergeant would approve of that transport. \n\nWe requested an ambulance to come and take her. The medics get on scene and decide she’s not a danger to her self so they won’t transport her to the hospital. \n\nAt this point 61 and I are looking at each and I tell hem “I think no one wants to deal with R so they’re passing up on her just like we’re about to do” \n\n61 and I tell R, “that if we have to come back and deal with her at all while on our shift, she’s going to jail” she understands what we’re telling her and starts to walk along 2. \n\n15 minutes after we clear, we get a call for a disturbance in progress at the buck-a-scoop restaurant on 2. \n\nWhile en route dispatch informs us that it’s R causing a disturbance and not leaving when the manager asked her to leave. \n\nWhen I arrive on scene she’s standing outside yelling at the manager of the restaurant and making racial slurs towards him. She looks at me and says “Well shit he’s back, the party pooper”, I tell her to come and talk to me and sit on the curb. \n\nWhile i’m talking to her, she notices a dead cat carcass in the middle of 2, and goes out and grabs it, I know she won’t run from us so there was no point in going hands on immediately with her, I told her to put it down and put her hands behind her back because she’s under arrest.\n\nWith the carcass in her hand and running past me towards the restaurant she looks at me and yells “FUCK YOU!” \n\nI tell dispatch, “71 she’s got a cat carcass, start me one” \n\n61 airs on the radio that he’s en route. \n\nI once again tell R to put the carcass down and put her hands behind her back, she refuses. \n\nR proceeds to put her hand in the carcass of the cat as if it was a puppet you can buy at toy store and tell stories with to kids. She walks over to the window at the front of buck-a-scoop and proceeds to start wiping the cat on the window back and forth as if she’s Mister Miyagi waxing on and off. She starts screaming “THIS IS THE NEXT CAT GOING IN THE FOOD” at this point in time i’m putting on my tactical ass stomping gloves and come up behind her, grab her shoulders and throw her to ground. \n\nAt this point 61 arrives on scene and we put cuffs on her and throw her in the back of the unit. We transport her to jail and book her on Animal Cruelty, Disturbing the peace, Destruction of private property and Harassment. \n\nAfter dealing with her, I threw my gloves away and decided to shower in hand sanitizer was a good idea.

At the beginning of the shift it was busy, bouncing from bullshit call to bullshit call that day shift decided to leave for graves. \n\nHalf asleep hiding behind a soccer stadium where it’s dark and secluded when all of the sudden a call drops for a rape in progress, the traffic explodes with units in route. \n\nResponding code 3 to the location of the call, we’ll it’s roughly an 8 minute drive from my current location to get there, but it took all of about 30 seconds and in that time i was processing how this was going to go down. \n\nI arrived first on scene to find a half naked DK female crying a her face somewhat covered at what first appeared to be blood that had dried up. \n\nI begin to question who appears to be the victim of the rape, later finding out she is. She states that her and her son had rented the motel room as they were passing through and needed a place to sleep for the night. They had gone to the liquor store down the street to get a couple cases of beer to drink. They had no intentions of getting drink, but a little buzz. \n\nFurther questioning trying to understand what had happened, the son of hers had a little bit too much to drink. In the mix of things something happened where he started to make sexual advancements ON HIS OWN FUCKING MOM. He proceeded to make out with her and told her he was going to fuck her and she had no choice. \n\nHe grabbed a knife to intimidate her and scare her, well it works, they go to the bed and he starts raping her, he still has the knife in his hand and as he is raping her he is holding it to her throat and says “if you make a noise i will slice your throat open”. Quickly after that had happened he started to make out with her and thought to herself the only escape route she has because he is going to kill her is to bite his tongue off, sure as shit she bit his tongue off, which would explain why she had blood on her face when i first arrived on scene and made contact with her. \n\nKeep in mind CSI, Detectives, an ambulance and Victim Advocate are already en route. \n\nThe son being too drunk to know what happened other than knowing he just forced his OWN MOTHER to have sex with him stays on scene, so he was immediately put in cuffs and taken to the PD for further questioning from a detective. \n\nRoughly 0245 a Detective arrives on scene \n\nI hear the detective ask the victim if she had the swallowed the tongue or what happened to it because we couldn’t find it. She stated after he got off of her she spit it out somewhere in the room. \n\nRoughly 0315 CSI arrives on scene. \n\nThe detective, my partner, and I are all looking for this fucking bit off tongue when our investor goes “what are y’all looking for” and we told him “the bit off tongue” and he mumbles under his breath “fuck me it’s gonna be a long night” \n\nI folded over one of the sheets on the bed and sure as shit, there it is laying there, and it was longer pinkish red, it had turned a light grey color and it’s basically dead. No one knows i find it and i picked it up and threw it at my parter and he puts his hand out as any natural instinct to catch something that’s flying at you and catches the tongue and realizes it and screams “OH FUCK THATS THE TONGUE” \n\nAfter clearing up at the scene, we all get back to the PD to start writing this up, my parter who is actually a good buddy of mine sits next to me and says “you ever do some dumb shit like that again i will have no issue blowing your face off”\n\nThe detective walks by and goes “this is one fucked up case, i’m gonna go an try and interview this guy”\n\nI replied with “want me to see if i can get a mumble interpreter?”\n\nHe laughed, I laughed and he walked away flipping me off and responded “don’t you think it’s a little too soon for fuck you jokes?” \n \nI look at my partner and he goes “if you look up sick bastard in the dictionary there’s a picture of your face and the guy who rapes his own mom in there”\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "My father has been a hose dragger all his life. he started his professional career as a plumber (also hose dragger) and later became a firefighter. when he became to old the be an active firefighter he transferred to vehicle maintenance for the local emergency serviceses (except police because they leased their cars). and every fourth week he had technical duty.\n\ntechnical duty means that you get a small van for a week filled with tools and rations so you can keep the firefighters going on larger fires. you are not allowed to go outside your region and you always have to be able to walk to your car  during this week. basically you are told that this is your car for this week and make sure you can respond to these 1 city and 5 surrounding towns within fifteen to twenty minutes. He would only be called when the situation got scaled up to large fire or any situation that called for fire department to be on site for more than 4 hours.\n\nso if I was in the car with him for any mundane reason and he would get beeped my job was to hang on for dear life as the audovisual signals got started and we were suddenly an emergency vehicle. no time to drop me off at the next bus station. when I got older (16+) he started shouting up to my room that he had a call and that I should get my shoes on if I wanted some action.\n\nWhen we would arrive on the scene of the fire my dad gave me a handheld radio and gave me an (of record) call sign (he was usually XX.XX.1 and I would be XX.XX.2) and give me a box of snickers and a box of gatorade to dish out to the firefighters mainly but I always gave snacks to police when I could. I never had to deal with EMT because if they had been to a call I went to they would have been long gone before I got there but they would also have had snacks.\n\nfurther jobs ranged from getting hoses to places where they were needed and fixing mechanical problems like vehicle malfunctions.\n\nNow to get to the story involving LE.\n\nWhen I was 16 me and dad where driving back home after visiting family. he got a call for a large fire at a Chinese restaurant. this restaurant was located at the ground floor of a 10 story apartment building. when we arrived on the scene we were beholding a prime example of frying fat and fire. this restaurant had a chimney running up the side of the building and the entire chimney was burning on the inside hot enough to melt the galvanized steel it was made of. and the kitchen was even worse.\n\nthe building had already been evacuated without problem so I started my routine as glorified catering attendant dishing out refreshments to any person in uniform I could find.\n\nEvery time I saw a cop they would tell me to get back behind the red/white tape. I would respond with my call sign and give them a mars bar. after that they would let me go on my way.\n\nlater that night I was asked to walk around the burned out kitchen with a thermal camera pointing out hotspots to the firefighters so they could flush the lingering fires in the walls and ceilings.\n\nby this time my father was just diagnosed with colon and spinal cancer. he was not given an expiry date but it was heavily implied that he probably not make the end of the year. this was eleven years ago and he is still alive. though he got paralyzed just above the waist about 9 months ago but he refuses to go to a care home. in the last 2 years I got to know the local EMT quite well and a lot of them knew my father from back in the day. we also get a lot of visitors from LE officers who know my father. almost all of them tel me that they tried to order me to go behind the tape sometime but that they were happy the didn't. \n\nmy moral of this story is that all emergency services are the heroes this world needs. even though you like to play it cool you all are present when someone hits a tree with their car, you are all there when a suicidal person lays their neck on the train tracks when a train is coming, you are all there when a restaurant burns down during prime time, you are all there when shit hits the fan in any major way. I understand the friendly rivalry between the hose draggers and boys in blue. to most firefighters humor and friendly rivalries are a coping mechanism for the shit they see on a regular basis.\n\nI have a visual disability that does not allow me to do your work or else I would have. my disability is best described as not being able to drive a car but good enough to work with an unaugmentend computer. just to bad that dispatch here only hires from ex emergency services workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Car has embedded itself (no minor feat) inside guardwire (think guard rail but out of wire), fire extruding from the engine. \n\nCounterpart and I validate with several bystanders and visually check that everyones out of the car.

        "text": "It was a rain day, which meant the only activity we were doing was responding to crashes. And if you weren't hurt or blocking the road, we weren't responding at all. I was working a beat where there was a crash at the same spot every half hour or so due to a curve on the freeway. There were flashing lights and reduced speed limit signs posted, but people would regularly ignore them. They became victims of their own decisions. I took that same curve thousands of times without ever losing control or crashing, but I adhered to the posted signs.\n\nI got a call of a single vehicle crash at the same spot. Knowing it was going to happen, I was posted nearby. I slowed traffic down to a halt as I set up flares to keep more people from crashing at the same place. Another unit arrived on scene and went to check on the crash for injuries. The fire department and ambulance arrived a few moments later.\n\nI finished making the scene safe, and asked the other Trooper, \"Any injuries?\" He told me, \"No...well, nothing visible.\" I asked, \"What does that mean?\" He told me to talk to the driver and I'd figure it out.\n\nI walked up to the car and saw it had moderate to major front end damage. Single occupant, just the driver, still in the driver's seat.\n\n\"How are you doing, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm okay, at least I think I am.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me what happened?\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nHuh. \"Yes, you were in a car crash.\"\n\n\"I was?\" Uh-oh. \"I'm really sorry for whatever I did.\"\n\n\"Sir, can you tell me what day it is?\" He thought for a while, and couldn't give me an answer. \"How about the month?\" Nope. \"...is this your car?\"\n\n\"No, I don't own a car like this.\"\n\n\"Did you hit your head?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Do you know what year it is?\" He gave me the wrong year. \"We'll have the paramedics take a look at you.\" I started to see a little trickle of blood near the front of his hair line. \n\nI looked at the damage to the car, looked at the road, and looked at crash debris and various scrapes throughout the scene. I had been to this same crash 20 times before, so I had a pretty good idea of what happened. On this particular one, he entered too fast, spun out, hit a wall on the right, pinballed back to the left, and hit the wall on the left head-on. He was probably going 35mph when he hit.\n\nI noted that the airbags didn't deploy. The car had airbags, and the car hit right where the sensors were. I ran the plate, and found that the car was registered to the driver. I also found that it had been crashed before. Somewhere along the way, the airbags stopped working.\n\nI went back to the driver, \"You said you don't own a car like this, but it's registered to you.\"\n\nHe thought for a little bit. \"That's right! I bought a new car...about 3 months ago.\" He looked around at all the emergency personnel around him. \"I'm really sorry for whatever I did.\"",

        "text": "The shoulder of the residential neighborhood was clearly not designed to allow for visitor parking. Somehow,  I managed to pull my beat up Impala just far enough into what would best be described as a ditch so as not to prevent passing motorists from cursing my bloodline, and made my way to the old split foyer where awaited my next case. Brett was sitting in his Explorer, idling in the yard – his face illuminated his laptop. It lit up even more when he noticed me approaching.\n\n“Glad you could make it!” He laughed, exiting his vehicle. He shrugged on a windbreaker and beamed at me. \n\n“It’s that bad?” I asked. \n\n“Worst I’ve ever seen.” He was still smiling. I grimaced and wished he would stop. \n\nWe trudged towards the house. A few dim lights had been turned on by crime scene and patrol, just enough mood lighting to make it somehow more foreboding. “What was that picture you sent me?”\n\n“Oh, the picture?” Brett was having a good time with this. “Oh man, just wait.”\n\n“It was all black. Was it the body?” I felt like the picture needed elaborating before entering the house of horrors. \n\n“Heh, I’m not going to tell you. You’ll see in a second.” Brett pulled open the creaky screen storm-door and waited for me to make the first move. “After you!” He waved his hand and bowed as though he was a gentleman on a first date. I reluctantly stepped inside. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the lack of odor. Usually on a decomposed body case, the smell is overwhelming. In this case, there was a faint smell that seemed familiar but by no means was the now familiar smell of decomposed human tissue. “What’s the smell? It’s not decomp.” \n\nBrett smiled wide once again. “You don’t recognize it? Maybe something from when your kids were in diapers… maybe of the fecal variety?”\n\n“That’s poop?” I smelled again and it registered. I guess my nose was just stuck on the preconceived stench of rot and got confused. “Not terrible. Is that all you wanted me to see?” \n\n“No. No way. Not by a long shot. Go see Deb – she’s with the body through the kitchen.” Brett pointed the way but made no move to follow. \n\n“Why are you smirking? What’s in the kitchen?”\n\n“It’s where I took the picture. Don’t turn on the light.” Brett took a step back towards the door we had just entered. \n\nI sighed and turned. The hazing stuff was getting old. \n\nThe kitchen was most likely original to the 1960’s construction – oddly colored appliances resting on yellowish linoleum flooring and a pea-green counter that would have been at home in the Brady Bunch kitchen. The ceiling was black though. I stopped and looked up at it. No, it wasn’t black, more metallic with bits of white scattered here and there. Then the white spots shifted. Again, not quite correct as I soon realized it was the “black” that was shifting. Flies. Thousands and thousands of flies. “Oh crap.” I muttered it loud enough for Brett to hear and he laughed in reply. \n\n“Crazy, right? I’ve never see so many. And they’re so… tranquil.” He peered in from outside but still made no move to enter. I just glared at him before continuing to Deb. She was in the foyer on the other side of the kitchen, knelt beside the rotten remains of what was once the resident of the home.  She looked up and blinded me with her headlamp. \n\n“Oh, sorry.” She flipped it down, out of my eyes. “Can’t turn on the lights for the flies, y’know?” \n\n“Nope, can’t say that I do.”\n\n“Oh.” She looked up again. “Makes them go crazy and they get annoying. Better to let them sleep.”\n\n“Ah.” I had nothing more to contribute as clearly there was a protocol to these scenarios I was yet to be familiar with. \n\n“Poor guy, huh?” Deb addressed the body. He was draped across a small pile of blueish-white fabric of some sort, partially mummified in his head and extremities. Empty eye sockets gaped at the ceiling and his lips had shrunk back into toothy growl. His bloated torso had several large blisters of fluid that I prayed Deb wouldn’t have to disturb at any point while I was around and a thick layer of brown sludge emanated from him into a wide, shallow pool, soaking into the carpet. I tried to work past revulsion and into the realm of sympathy where Deb seemed so content. She must have noticed my struggle. \n\n“He fell down the stairs a month ago or so. Probably should have stayed in the hospital but apparently he checked himself out. I guess he had some kind of lingering injury that caused him to have uncontrollable diarrhea – hence the large pile of adult diapers he died on.” She indicated the pile of blueish-white fabric I had noted before. \n\n“He… he saved his dirty diapers?”\n\n“Oh yeah, grade-A hoarder this guy, right!” She addressed the corpse. I’m not sure if she expected an answer. I tore my gaze from the body and glanced around the home. Sure enough, stacks of newspapers, old Time magazines, and grocery bags filled with junk mail and receipts abounded – any one of which was a much better option to have died upon than a heap of shitty diapers. \n\n“Poor guy.” I was able to mutter. \n\n“Look!” Deb pointed back behind her to the door leading to the living room. “You can follow his trail!” A brown line of now desiccated feces led to a couch. “That’s why he wasn’t wearing pants!” Deb was far too excited with how this case was unfolding. \n\nI took a second to compose myself further before addressing her. “So, you’re just checking for other injury? Signs of a fight or something? Just to make sure this was natural and not a murder, right?” \n\n“Yuuuup.” Deb was running her gloved hands through the corpse’s scalp, shearing off brittle hairs while trying to feel for skull fractures. “And, it looks like everything is okie-dokie! Just got to bag-and-tag him and we’re all done here!” \n\n“Great!” I looked around for Brett whose absence now seemed more conspicuous. A thump to my chest stopped my search short. \n\n“Glove up!” Deb had tossed me a bundle of latex gloves, Tyvek sleeves and booties, and a head lamp. Thankfully, my ‘gift’ hadn’t rolled into the lake of goo and I was able to retrieve them, free of biohazards. \n\n“Don’t you think we could use more help? Maybe I should get Brett?” \n\nDeb looked up, her headlamp cast down her face like a kid trying to be spooky at a sleepover. “Yeah! Great idea. Go get him!” Her effervescence was uncanny in this environment. \n\nI finished applying my protective gear and affixing my headlamp before setting off on my scavenger hunt of schadenfreude. The headlamp gave a satisfying ‘CLICK’ when I depressed the power button, shooting a bright beam of LED light in front of me to better avoid any errant fecal trails I may encounter. I opted to pass back through the kitchen versus run the poo-gauntlet I knew awaited me in the living room. Two steps in, I hazarded a glance up at the flies. It was a huge mistake. \n\n“Don’t look up!” Deb yelled from behind me, though it was too late. My headlamp burned through the accumulated flies like a thousand degree knife through a bar of Irish Springs. They scattered in every direction and the buzzing sound was almost deafening. I opened my mouth to curse but immediately regretted it – a large specimen buzzed in on cue and ran into the back of my throat. I choked and staggered to the screen door followed by a trail of a few hundred more carrion loving insects and burst into the open air. I wretched and hacked up the offending bug, then spit some more for good measure. \n\n“You didn’t just spit out a fly, did you?” Brett asked, though I noticed he was particularly devoid of actual concern. \n\n“Shut up.” My throat was raw from coughing already and I felt the urge to scrub my tongue with a Brill-o pad. Brett just laughed.\n\n“You woke up the buggies! You should never wake up the buggies!”\n\n“I know that now, you jerk.” I spit again for emphasis. “Deb wants you inside to help bag-and-tag.”\n\n“Ugh!” Brett’s good mood finally cracked. He shook his head in defeat before stomping inside, making his way through the still swarming flies with irritated swats of his hands. I followed closely behind.\n\nDeb tossed him a set of PPE and he suited up as well. She then gave the marching orders. “Brett – you take the head.” Brett scoffed but didn’t argue. “Jones and I will take an arm and leg each and we’ll walk him into the bag.” An unzipped body bag already lay on the floor a few feet away. Deb was nothing if not efficient. \n\nWe all positioned ourselves in our spots and I slowly bent to grab the body’s left ankle and shoulder. I could feel the cold, clammy skin through the latex and hoped this ordeal would soon be over. I was unable to locate a good spot to grip the shoulder so instead I grasped the thin wrist, hoping there was enough rigor in place to support him into the bag. \n\n“3, 2, 1... Lift!” Deb called out. We all synchronized wonderfully, lifting with our legs and carefully maneuvering the body up from the murky pool of bodily fluids. I noticed the body began to shift a bit away from me, though I hadn’t moved with it. With a sound akin to pulling the prized drumstick from the Thanksgiving turkey, the man’s torso pulled free of his left arm – still in my hand. The sudden shift in weight caused more of a burden to be placed on Brett’s charge and I saw, in slow motion, his expression realign to one of terror as once more a ripping sound alighted the air; a harbinger of the awfulness to follow. The now half-armed torso swung down, pulling free of its burdensome skull and settling once more in the lake of feces and rot with a wet ‘splat.’ \n\nWe all stood still for a moment, surveying the horror. Brett was the first to move, slowly bending and gingerly placing the severed head on the carpet next to my feet. I was now grasping the body-less arm with both hands like a precious Egyptian relic. Deb made a clucking sound of annoyance. \n\n“Jeez, guys! C’mon. Brett, help me get him into the bag.” \n\nBrett snapped to, hurdling the goo lake to assist Deb who still maintained her hold on the man’s arm and ankle. He tenderly lifted him at the rib cage and they placed him into the bag. \n\n“Arm!” Deb barked at me, hand in the air expectantly awaiting my relic. I passed it over and she tucked it in to the bag as well. “Now head!”\n\nI looked around, wondering who she was addressing. Brett gave me a shell shocked stare but Deb’s look told me I was the one to complete her task. I swallowed hard and picked the head up. Deb realized something was amiss in the body bag and stooped to fix it. I let the head float in mid-air, refusing to allow my brain to register what I was doing exactly and instead reverting to my defensive “statue” posture. \n\nAn odd sound began coming from the area I refused to acknowledge. You can experience this sound by following these steps: go purchase a can of off-brand refried beans – the more lard in them, the better. Open one side with a can opener and overturn the can so that you can now gently shake the contents into a bowl. Now stop and observe. That wet, slurping/sucking sound the can is making as the oddly colored contents slide out? I can assure you that is very close to the sound a partially decomposed brain makes when sliding out the hole left by a head being severed from a decomposed spinal cord. \n\nA sack of greyish muck flopped onto my Tyvek-booty covered shoe. Deb noticed and looked up after I gently shook my foot free of brain. She reached out and relieved me of my burden. Brett still looked shell shocked and made no move to stop me as I slowly walked away, making sure this time to turn off my headlamp before passing through the flies’ kitchen. \n\nAfter several minutes of fresh air and fighting the urge to drench the Crape Myrtles in my partially digested dinner, Brett joined me. \n\n“That was… something.”\n\n“I never want to do that again.” I admitted.\n\n“Me neither.” He ran his hands over his face and leaned back, gazing up at the stars. “I don’t know how she’s still in there.”\n\nI realized Deb was still at it. “That woman is unnatural.” We sat in silence for a while. Finally, I broke the trance. “I guess I’ve got to go help her.”\n\n“Yeah, go for it.” Brett walked back to his car. I hesitantly went back inside. In the foyer, Deb was still stooped by the area where the man had come to rest. The body bag was not quite zipped up and she was hard at work at something. I clicked on my head lamp and she looked up.\n\n“That was crazy, huh?” She was somehow smiling again.\n\nI meant to agree but instead was captivated with the work I saw she had been engaged in. “Wh-what are you doing?”\n\n“Oh this?” Deb ran her gloved fingers through the goo lake like a rake, forming neat rows of lines and creating a terrible squelching sound. “I’m looking for his missing finger bones. Neat, huh?” \n\nI bid Deb goodnight. \n",

        "text": "OK, so this happened to me in a magical time when Bush was President.  I was lurking in the sub and decided to share. Due to circumstances not relevant to the story, I had to move quickly, and found a place on Craigslist within my price range.  The place was a decent 3 bed house, I'd be sharing with a guy I'll call Cali-bro.  This guy was almost a walking stereotype of everything bad about Southern Cali.  He had this air of smugness and whenever you didn't do something he wanted he would just \"dude, come on...come on dude.\" until you relented.  Anyway, shortly after another roomie joined who was in town for the Navy Flight school I'll refer to Ensign Kim.  It turned out that Cali-bro rented out the rooms because he just had a big split with his baby mama, and needed help with the rent.  Whatever, it was a nice enough house with a pool table, so that was his business. I didn't know much about what went on between them, but Baby Mama's Dad was involved and so was a restraining order.  3 July 200X I wake up, and her car was outside and he was out there talking with her.  Eventually they go inside to his bedroom to presumably fool around, then they walk out together, talk some more, and she leaves.  The next day I was hanging out in the living room watching Constantine (Keanu version)  and Cali-bro comes over, sits on the couch, but doesn't say anything to me.  He makes a few phone calls to his friends and all I pick up was \"If they call, tell them I'm such &amp; such place.\"  I didn't catch all of it, nor did I care.  Shortly after he gets up and leaves without saying a word to me, so I shrug and go back to my movie.  Right at the scene of Lucifer acceding in the movie I look outside to see a squad car, and two officers knock at the door.  I figure who they're there for wasn't me, thinking I had nothing to hide, so I answer and get some hasty questions.  \n\n&gt;Officer 1:  \"Are you Cali-Bro?\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"No sir, he left about half hour ago.\"\n\n&gt;O1:  \"Well where did he go? What kind of car does he drive?\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"He didn't say anything to me, and I don't know his car.\"\n\n&gt;O1:  \"He's your roommate and you don't know what car he drives?\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"I just met the guy last month on Craig's List, and I don't really pay attention to car models.  It's a black Acura maybe?\"\n\n&gt;O1:  \"Well you got ID?\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"Yes sir.\"  *-Retrieve my wallet and give them my id.  Officer 2 calls it in-*\n\nWe chat some more, and I explain the living situation when suddenly I hear from Officer 2's radio \"Warrant for Fraud\" and suddenly I'm in cuffs sitting down on a foot stool while the officers search the house suspecting I was hiding him.  Turns out the warrant was for a bad check I wrote several years ago when I was broke because I was a shithead.  Well, after finding nothing, they put me in the back of the cruiser and I'm being hauled to Castle Greyskull (Local nickname for our county jail)  During the ride the officers speak up\n\n&gt;O2:  We'll cut you a break, we'll forget about the joint roaches we found in your night stand, and just put you into rapid intake if you give us a call next time you see Cali-bro\n\n&gt;Me:  [?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P5qbcRAXVk)\n\nI knew for a fact they were bluffing, because the stuff I did have was well hidden because he had a habit of pinching off my sack when I was at work.  If they did find things on a night stand, it was his room not mine. (statute of limitations long over now on that possession)\n\n&gt;Me:  \"Look, I pride myself on keep out of my roommate's bullshit.  It's the best way for me to keep civil with them. And whatever weed you found on that nightstand isn't mine.  I know that for a fact\"\n\n&gt;O2:  \"Well, we can just let you sit it out in a cell for the night if you'd rather.\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"Alright, I'll call you if I see you, but he's been squirrely today and I've kept out of his baby mama drama.\"\n\nSo they take me to rapid intake, and give me their card.  I'm finger printed, mug shotted, and given a court date and sent me on my way.  Unfortunately my cell phone was left back home and I only had one number memorized who didn't answer, and I wound up walking back home as the sun was setting so at least I got a fireworks show.  As I'm getting into my neighborhood, I turn down a street to see the same cruiser but with Cali-bro in the back this time, and Ensign Kim was out in the yard\n\n&gt;ENS Kim: \"So Cali-bro got taken to jail. Baby Mama's Dad found out about her coming over and it broke the restraining order.\"\n\n&gt;Me:  \"Yeah, I know, they came earlier looking for them, and took me in on something unrelated.\"\n\nI'm really not sure what else went down as ENS Kim and I moved out by the end of that month and never saw him again.  Turns out the restraining order was put into place because he was started to get violent and her parents had the order put on to protect them.  I have no idea what broke it, because she was the one to come to his house.  But as for my case, I just stood in front of the judge and was told to pay it + the fine off.  \n\ntl;dr  I got pinned for something I did when I was a shithead 19 years old because my roommate had baby mama drama.",

        "text": "I’ve wanted to be a police officer for quite a while. I started doing ridealongs with my neighbor when I was 17. When I got to college I got to that phase in my life where I was unsure if it’s what I wanted to do. I tried Buisness. Too boring. Economics. Too much math. Eventually they made Criminal Justice an actual major at my school. I even landed a pretty good internship with a big city to learn more. Everyday was a ride along for me. This is about these times.\n\nI had been out of college for 2 years at this point. Someone I had known since middle school when we played soccer together and had been an officer for a few years in a small town. Most of my ridealongs has been with seasoned vets. People that were old enough to be my parents. I wanted to get a perspective from someone my own age on what this profession was like. Texts were sent, permission forms signed and off we went after I was done with work. \n\nPretty uneventful night, made a traffic stop, arrest for suspended license that’s about it for a few hours. We bs about what everyone was up to after highschool, who fucked up, who made it big, places I should apply and relive the fun we had in school. Eventually towards the end we get a call of a dead cat in the road. We roll up, it’s not a cats. Close but no cigar it’s a possum. My buddy gets out to check on it. He pulls out his baton and gives it a couple of pokes. Meanwhile I’m sitting in the car, and I see him recoils in disbelief. \n\n“It’s still alive?!?” He says as he gets back into the car. \n“How?” I reply\n“I don’t know but it’s fucked up, I’m gonna have to dispatch it”. \n\nHe radios into to dispatch and he relays the information. “Dispatch correction on that call it’s not a cat it’s a possum.” \n\n“Affirmitve *****.......MEOW.” \n\nWe both look at each other at the same time.\n\nI ask “Did she just meow?” \n\n“ I think she just meowed. Alright time to dispatch this cat possum thing.” \n\nHe gets out searches for some ear pro but doesn’t have any. He pushes the possum to the side of the road with his batton, draws his pistol and fires one round. \n\n“Fuck I missed!”  He yells. He just barely missed the center of the possums head. \n\nHe fires again. “Fuck!” He hit but now it’s doing the death dance twerking like Miley Cyrus in a music video.\n\nHe fires one more time putting the possum out of its misery. No more movement.\nHe gets back into the car and I ask him how his ears feel. \n\nHe replies with “What!?”\n",

        "text": "Figured I'd share a story since I've taken so much free entertainment from this sub. Please forgive formatting as I am on mobile.\n\nThis story comes from when I was a 16 year old stoner, working part time at a grocery store and driving a 30 year old, beat up, rust bucket of a truck. \n\nTo set the scene: it was a winter afternoon while I was on my way home from work. It snows a lot where I live, but this day was a little warmer than usual, causing the snow and ice to melt, which creates this slippery, muddy slush that covers every road. \n\nSo here I am, driving home from work a little stoned, with a little bit of weed and a pipe somewhere in my truck. The weed actually doesn't have much importance in this story, other than the fact that I dodged a huge bullet. \n\nAnyways, as I'm driving I got on a ramp to merge on to a main roadway. I had to turn left less than a block after merging from the right side, so I essentially needed both lanes clear when I merged. As I'm coming down the ramp I notice a ton of traffic heading up the road, but there is a gap in front of all of them so I decided I could get in front of the traffic safely, so I sped up a bit to make the gap. \n\nThe speed limit on the road I was merging onto is 60km/h. I was probably doing 70 when i merged into the right lane of this road. Since I had to get into the left lane, I shoulder checked and sped up to get in front of the approaching traffic in the left lane. After I shoulder check and begin changing lanes, I look up and see a man with a bright vest walk in to the right lane. Quickly I notice it's a cop. Shit. I slam on my brakes, as I was doing about 80 and halfway through changing lanes. I realize I'm not going to stop in time due to the slush, so I swerve around the cop and stop 50 feet past him. He motions for me to back up and pull onto the side street, where I see a few patrol cars and a bunch of other people getting speeding tickets. \n\nSo finally I'm pulled over and the cop approaches the window. This is the same guy that walked out onto the road to stop me and he will be known as male cop. He asks for the usual license registration and insurance, so I start digging around looking for everything, while the cop walked away to deal with another speeder. \n\nSo I find my license and registration, but my insurance card is nowhere to be found. I actually found some old expired insurance cards but I couldn't find the current one. \n\nWhen the officer returns he doesn't take my license and registration but instead says \"you know you almost hit me.\" \n\nI've always know to be polite when dealing with cops so I just mutter a \"I'm sorry bout that officer.\"\n\nHe continues on: \"what do you think would've happened if you hit me? Maybe you need to spend the 5 bucks to replace your wipers if you can't see properly.\"\n\nMy wipers were fine, I just was shoulder checking when he stepped into the road, and I didn't come close to hitting him. All I wanted to say was maybe it's not the safest thing to walk out on an icy road in front of speeding cars, but I wisely kept my mouth shut while this cop berated me for about 10 minutes, before taking my license and registration, and I went back to digging for my insurance card. \n\nWhile the cop is gone I start freaking out because of how pissed this cop is, if I can't find my insurance, this guy is not going to cut me a break and I'm going to be looking at a hefty ticket that I can't afford, or getting my truck impounded. Or maybe he will decide to search my truck and I'll get arrested for the weed. \n\nSo as I'm freaking out and deciding that my life is over I notice the male cop talking to a young female cop who was standing near by while male cop was yelling at me. \n\nShe walks up to me, hands me my license and registration and says \"so we got you at 79 in a 60, so here's your ticket for that.\"\n\nI also forgot to mention that that truck was registered to my dad even though I was the only one who drove the truck. \n\nThe cop says \" I notice this vehicle is registered to (my dad's name)?\"\n\n\"Yeah that's my dad.\"\n\nI figure they assumed I couldn't find the insurance card becsuse i was borrowing my dad's truck.  \n\nSo after giving me my ticket, young female cop says \"So make sure you find your insurance card and slow down out there. Also, sorry about Johnson, he can be a bit of a dick when he hasn't had his burrito yet. Anyways have a good day.\"\n\nI decided to stop for lunch on my way home and as I pull out my wallet what do I see? My insurance card sitting there and I remember how I put it in my wallet so that I would never have an issue trying to find it in my truck. Oops\n\nSorry if this story sucked but I hope it's alright! And I know I was being a dumbass kid and was in the wrong, and I still have the utmost respect for both officers.",

        "text": "I was a Military Police officer in the US Army. My favorite part about my job was obviously working patrol as a Law Enforcement officer. For the first 2 years of my career, I was stationed in Schweinfurt, Germany. In Schweinfurt there were a couple clubs that soldiers spent most of their weekend nights partying at. The most popular one was called The Mad-diskothek. It was generally packed wall to wall with soldiers trying to hook up with a German gal, other soldiers, or less often, a lonely spouse who husband was currently deployed.\n\nAnyhow, we were often asked to do a 2-3 foot patrol inside the clubs to show the soldiers that \"we're here, don't get stupid\" and also to assist the bouncers if they had any issues with the soldiers. You guys may find this hard to believe, but soldiers love to get drunk and fight (who knew?!) It also helped build rapport with the bouncers and got us treated very well whenever we'd come in off duty.\n\nSo this particular evening was a Thursday, and the club was pretty dead. About 40-50 locals, and a group of 5 soldiers. I had known one kid, Rivera, from when we inprocessed to Germany together. Well it was pretty slow on shift as well, so we hung out in the club for about 2 hours when the soldiers get ready to leave. I observed every one of them consuming alcohol, which is totally fine until they leave, and we start walking out. I see a vehicle start up and back out, and start driving towards the exit. It's Rivera driving with all 4 soldiers piled in. I stop him by standing in front of the exit and ask what he's doing. \n\nHe says \"I'm headed back to the barracks sergeant, it's late.\" I could instantly tell that he was inebriated, so I explained that wasn't what was going to happen. I said \"Look man, the German police will hammer you, then you're chain of command will hammer you after we do. Right now, this is considered a traffic stop. You are still in the parking lot, and you know that I became an MP because I like to help people. So here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna turn around, re-park your car and give me your keys. You and two other soldiers are gonna ride with me, the other 2 will ride with my partner. We're gonna take you back to the barracks. I will get someone from CQ who is Sober, bring them back here and get your car, and drive it to the barracks. TECHNICALLY, if I wanted to be an asshole, I could call the German police here and you can actually get a DUI right now, still in the parking lot. But I'm not an asshole, and again, I'm just trying to help you out bro.\"\n\nHe agrees, the other guys aren't really thrilled about this inconvenience, but they're okay. I assume riding to the barracks in a patrol car is kind of a buzzkill, but so is getting a DUI and possibly injuring or killing someone. So, when we get to the barracks, we drop these guys off and I meet with CQ. CQ is like a receptionist for the units outside of business hours. They're in uniform, sober, and the point of contact for their unit while they are off. I meet with a Staff Sergeant and explain the situation to him. He thanks me repeatedly for not giving his soldier a DUI, and assured me several times that he's going to \"fuck Rivera up as soon as he's sober\" which I'm assuming means making him do lots of physical activity whilst explaining how serious and stupid his decision to drive was, and how things could've gone A LOT DIFFERENT and he could've lost his career, etc. I am pretty confident that he'll take care of the situation in house and everything will be okay.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday of the next week, when I'm on duty, and FIRST Sergeant So and so comes walking up to the MP station with Rivera. That's his bosses bosses boss. Yeah, this had became a pretty big deal in his unit. He makes Rivera clean one of the patrol cars, as a thank you for not giving him a DUI. After seeing that, I'm VERY CONFIDENT that he gets the point and will not make a poor decision next time. Oh..but people can be so stupid sometimes. \n\nFriday night comes around, I begin my shift at 11:00 PM. I arrived with my crew for the night, send them to the patrol room to get ready for briefing while I talk to the patrol supervisor and get ready to switch with him and his guys. I'm talking to the desk sergeant when I see Rivera in the interview room. I stop mid conversation and open the door to the room. I said \"What's up man? What are you doing in here so late? Still thankful for the break?\"\n\nHe lowers his head, and I shit you not says \"I got arrested for DUI, sergeant.\" At this point, I'm furious. He's not my soldier, and in all reality, he's just another one of the soldiers in Schweinfurt. But due to the recent run-in, I had better hopes. I was seriously pissed off. Before I lost my composure, I managed to say\" You're seriously the biggest fucking moron I've deal with in a while. I can't wait to call your chain of command and tell them what a waste of oxygen you are.\"\n\nI wrote a supplemental report to add to his charges explaining that he was just given a break less than a week prior in hopes that whoever handles his case would be sure to know that it's not an isolated incident.\n\nThanks for reading, if you enjoyed, I've got plenty more stories!\n\nTL;DR: I cut a kid a break and chose not to give him a DUI, after a week's worth of punishment from his chain of command, he still chose to go out the next weekend and actually get himself a DUI.",

        "text": "I was driving down a smaller, side street when I saw a guy in a motorized wheelchair off the paved section of the sidewalk, trying to drive across a small ravine. It looked like he may have been stuck, so I turned around and spoke with him. It turned out he was stuck, so I got him out of the mud and on his way. My job is to help people.\n\nI received a call for any nearby units in the area to assist the Sheriff with a domestic violence call. It was a small county with units spread thin, and since I was closest I went en route. There was a lot of yelling coming from a room in an apartment complex. Once I got there, I learned a 6' tall boyfriend had been choking out his 5'2\" girlfriend. He fled on foot before I got there, but I stood by until the Sheriff showed up in case the boyfriend returned and tried to attack her again. My job is to help people.\n\nI pulled a kid over for speeding, 15 over the limit. He was also missing some required information in his car. I gave him a warning on the speed, but gave him a fix-it ticket for missing the paperwork. I wanted him to understand what he did earned a ticket, but he didn't need one that was going to stay on his record. Once he was free to leave, he realized his car battery was dead. I gave him a jump start and got him on his way. My job is to help people.\n\nI pulled up behind a car blocking a busy road at a stop light with its hazards on. He was waving traffic to go around him. The driver told me he ran out of gas, and didn't have any money to get more. I pushed his car off to the shoulder. He asked me for a ride a couple miles to his friend's house. He could've walked there, but it was a 5 minute drive or a 1 hour walk, so I gave him a ride. My job is to help people.\n\nI stopped to talk to a young guy on a freeway shoulder, leaning against a guardrail, and he was crying. He said he was hanging out with some acquaintances who kicked him out of the car, while on the freeway, about 100 miles from home. His cell phone was dead, he didn't know anyone in the area, and he didn't have any money. I drove him to a bus station and paid for his ticket home out of my own pocket. My job is to help people.\n\nThe courts say my job is to enforce the law. I've never met anyone who wears a badge who thinks that's the case. Our job is to help people.",

        "text": "I was on patrol on a rural county road. The only light was a full moon and my cell phone. When it's this dark, most people stick pretty close to the 55mph speed limit. Any faster and you're over-driving your headlights. Most of the speed I was getting was low 60's and I wasn't interested in that.\n\nI suddenly heard the radar start screaming. 90mph...105mph...and increasing as the car passed me, going the other direction, passing two other cars in the process. I flipped a U-turn and went after it. As I did so, I saw it take the first turn off the main road. One of the driver's of the cars that it passed had his arm sticking out the window, pointing me to where he went. Safe driver's are always happy to sell out the reckless ones.\n\nA few hundred feet down that road was a closed gate, and the car was trapped. I pulled in behind the speeder (a Mercedes) and both front doors suddenly opened. Oh boy, here comes a shootout or a foot chase, and my backup was all 30 minutes out. The right front passenger started heading away from me, towards a ravine. The driver got out and yelled at me, \"It's an emergency! It's an emergency! She really has to go pee!\"\n\nI felt a combination of frustration and relief. I yelled back, \"She can go pee. You can get back in the car.\" He did.\n\nI walked up to his window. \"I'm sorry, man, she just really had to go, like she was going to go all over the seats...\"\n\n\"114.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"114 miles per hour, that's how fast you were going. I need to see your driver's license.\"\n\n\"Okay I got it right here. But you understand I knew I could pull over right here and it was off the road and she really had to go. I really can't afford a ticket right now, man, if you could cut me a break, 'cause I just don't need a ticket...\"\n\n\"No. You were doing more than double the speed limit, you're not getting a break.\"\n\n\"Okay, well, you know if you're running radar you have to have your lights on.\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Yeah, your parking lights. My dad is a cop and he told me.\" This guy was about 40 years old.\n\n\"Really, what's the code?\"\n\n\"I don't know, my dad told me.\"\n\n\"That's because there is no law that says that. The only one that's close says when I pull you over, I have to have a forward blue light on, and there's lots of those on my car right now. Wait in the car, I'll be right back.\" At this point the passenger was back in the car.\n\nHis registration was current, his insurance was current, and his license was valid. I cut him two breaks; I wrote him for under 100, and didn't write him for the 100mph law which gets your license suspended. He was very appreciative. I was happy I didn't have to shoot anyone.",

There was definitely more than one person around this portable radio. Then I hear \"Closer.......\" then a long pause, \"Closer.....almost there.....closer......\" As if I wasn't confused enough as to what in the hell was going on on the other side of the radio the radio erupts, \"YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHH\". It takes about 20 seconds to gather myself from the wild open mic that's occurring, I managed to key up \"Investigator 243 you have an open mic on the gate, Investigator 243 you have an open mic on the gate.\" The investigator keyes back up, \"10-4, sorry about that\".\n\nTo this day I still don't know what in the hell was going on.\n\nEdit: When the screaming erupted, it was at least 10 people. I could clearly hear 10 people screaming “YEEEAAAAAHHHH”",

Every time I'd see someone who was flying by another car, it was because the slow car was doing 10 under the limit, and the fast one was simply at the limit.\n\nAfter an hour of seeing nothing more than 3 over, I was about to leave when I finally got a good hit; 86mph.

I played it off like I was going to back him up.\n\nIn my defense, he was driving a lightly marked car with no external lights. After that, I went back to the office and just waited for a call.

        "text": "Among other things, I used to dispatch the police responsible for one of the largest trauma centers in the country. It was all flavors of lunacy, it turned my facial hair gray over the course of a winter and that's no joke.\n\nSomewhere between my second and third pot of coffee of the night, a unconscious and badly hurt woman was brought in from a hit-skip. In the middle of surgery they figured out she was pregnant, and it went from a serious but routine procedure, to a \"write this down for a textbook\" kind of emergency. Without ID to pull a medical history, they had to rely on their eyeballs, and was of an ethnicity that stayed startling petite even in pregnancy.\n\nEverything goes okay, mom and baby are stabilized, just another night of big medicine in the big city.\n\nI kept a working relationship with the nursing staff (that's a lie, they were pretty and I came up with excuses to be around them) and they let me in on the growing problem. She didn't speak English, and post-anesthesia they couldn't pull any info out of her. Days pass, and she's lucid enough to explain that, of all things, she's from Bhutan (look it up, I had to). It took awhile more to find a translator for her particular language, but at significant effort we finally dredged one up.\n\nProblem was, this fella barely spoke English himself. Nobody could tell if he understood enough to pass on, and he seemed to get more and more defensive over her. Over the course of a few days he got incredibly attached to her, and it got to the point where he wouldn't leave the room. Our officers finally had to get involved, the only reason he wasn't ejected was the almost total lack of any other fluent speakers in (probably) the country.\n\nAfter about a week, the baby daddy presents himself. Mr. Lothario was a local (don't ask me how they hooked up through the language barrier, that's some Nicholas Sparks shit) and we finally get good information on her. A social worker eventually got ahold *of her husband* back home, and he flips his lid.\n\nMr. Bigshot Asian Businessman does a lot of business internationally, and his wife decided to just stay here after their last trip. Our suspicion was that she ran away and he didn't care enough to look, but he sends his lawyer anyway to sort things out. Unfortunately his legal eagle was Hong Kongese, and probably learned all his American law via JAG reruns on the flight.\n\nEast Asian Matlock can't provide the proper documentation to make decisions for her and starts getting into it with the clinical staff, the translator can't or won't voice her consent on anything, and our legal team starts throwing galactic shit-fits about liability and legality. Everything starts slipping further and further off the rails, and things come to a crescendo when Lothario tried to beat the lawyer in the ER drive.\n\nI'm still nursing my first cup of coffee for the night when a call comes in, low and behold, I'm speaking to the gawddamned Bhutanese embassy. The first pangs of \"international incident\" hit the administrators, and a frothing panic spreads from office to office upstairs. Things got real ruthless, real fast.\n\nLothario goes to jail (did I mention he had a warrant), the Translator gets the boot and a personal call from our Chief of Staff to his boss, and the Lawyer holes himself up in an airport hotel still desperately googling medical power of attorney, how to.\n\nThings quiet down, she recuperates in peace and is surprisingly polite on her own. One of our interns at the time was Nepalese (?) and they could communicate enough to just about get by. She was discharged shortly after, and thinking back now, I'm pretty sure the county stepped in to get her someplace stable.\n\nI only saw her once, one morning about 0300 I was walking back from the physicians-only Starbucks (don't tell) and saw her being transported from the floor. For all that was going on around her, she seemed remarkably happy with her child.\n\n**Morning after edit** Changed a few clarifying details, you folks are great.",

It's been an easy Friday, which is surprising in the summer, we normally have an uptick in crime from the kids being off from school. I'm eating deer jerky, my buddy had given me some after I told him that I love jerky, he's a big-time hunter, good to know the cops that have too much jerky. \n\nI'm stationed with my vehicle lights pointed at a four-way intersection with traffic lights. There are no vehicles on the road this late at night so I'm just spending most of my time on r/NFL or r/soccer catching up on some of my sports news. I see a vehicle come to a red light and stop. I go back to reading, and hear a loud BEEEEP.\n\nI look up and see a silver sedan run a red light causing the other vehicle to beep. I lock eyes with the driver that beeped and give him a silent head nod. I turn my engine over and roar out of the parking lot, or more likely my engine sputters and my tires squeal, as the transmission tries to go up a gear, Ford Explorers… \n\nLights and sirens behind the silver sedan, I catch up in about 5 seconds as it turns right towards a set of apartments. The vehicle pulls over, blasting some very hilarious Fall Out Boy playing Centuries. I see at least 5 people in the vehicle. \n\nI key up telling dispatch I'm on a traffic stop. I hear Joe key up and ask for my location, we were working together in separate units doing overtime so we can have the money required to buy buffalo wings at our favorite local watering hole. \n\nAs I approach the vehicle I see a lot of movement, which makes me hesitate, I tell myself I'm going to wait at the bumper of the vehicle till Joe arrives. \n\nJoe shows up about a minute later, we always have our units very close to each other as we are the only back up in the area. Joe calmly walks up next to me, ask if I have a code 4? \n\nI respond, \"Shit I never opened the air back up?\"\n\nJoe responds, \"Nah, but whatever the other district isn't on fire yet and they never shut up so let's take our time for once.\" \n\nI approach the driver side while Joe sits back on the back passengers. I see a very scared 16-year-old kid with 4 other kids in the back, the vehicle smells of alcohol. Great, I just got myself a D.I.U. with two hours to go on my detail, and I will be doing all the paperwork, looks like I'm going to have a long night at least three to four hours. \n\n\"Hi I'm officer u/brownbearks, license, insurance, and registration.\" The kid is shaking, I look at Joe and put four fingers up, Joe, key's up and tells dispatch we have a Code 4, dispatch acknowledges. \n\nI tell the kid, \"Relax,\" I look down at his license, \"John, (not his real name), just step out of the vehicle.\" \n\nAll the kids inside do the stupid, \"Ohhhhhhh,\" you are in trouble at school when you get called in by the teacher. \n\nJoe calmly states to all of them, \"You might want to be quiet or all of you may have to call your parents from jail.\" The car becomes dead silent. \n\nI bring young John back towards my unit, as Joe babysits the quiet children. \"John, I smell alcohol in the vehicle, I'm going to ask you a set of questions and run some tests to see if you have been drinking, okay?\"\n\nJohn nods his head, the kid is maybe 5'8\" on a good day, but he quietly tells me, \"Sir, I'm the DD tonight, please don't arrest my friends.\" I look at him, \"You pass this test and I'll let you drive them home.\" He smiles and nod his head. \n\nJohn passes all of my tests, I ask him why he was driving so fast and blasting music this late at night in a residential area. \"My friends wanted me to go fast, we just got some late-night food, I have donuts as well officer if you want some.\"\n\nJoe, stifling his own laughter looks at me, I love donuts off duty, I never eat them in uniform. \"I see John, well I'm going to let you off with a warning, cause I could write several tickets for you, but you are doing the right thing tonight, so I'm feeling lenient, please turn down the music and slow down, you have 4 people in that vehicle and you are in control. I'll say that again, YOU are the driver and YOU control your vehicle, okay?\" \n\nJohn thanks me and gets back into the vehicle. I look in the vehicle and tell everyone to be quiet when they get home, cause if I get a call of a bunch of kids being loud, everyone is going to jail. \n\nJohn drives away, Joe comes over to me, \"I was about to tell you to follow John home for donuts.\" As usual Joe gets the last joke in, I go back to my spot and start lurking in r/Askreddit, time for some laughs.",

A delicious large burrito with steak, cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole (cause I work details and can afford it), hot sauce, and lettuce. I know the bartender as she is dating one of my buddies on the job and she hands me a warm brownie on the down low for me to eat after my burrito.  It’s who you know, or who’s banging who. \n\nI get into my unit and observe my paperwork is strewn across the dashboard. I look over my notes, it's a messy domestic arrest with a pregnant baby mama going to jail for hitting her boyfriend. I ask her what she thought would happen when she called the police, \"I'd thought you arrest both of us or just him, since I'm pregnant.\" \n\nUgh, I already know the ADA is going to drop this case when it gets to court since it's he/she said, and the guy isn't going to show up to put his girlfriend away. So, 2 hours of paperwork for no reason with pictures, that's fine, I got my burrito. \n\nI see another unit pull up next to mine. Joe looks at me incredulously, \"Do you ever not eat a burrito? Fat ass...\" He lets that linger in the air as I take my second bite of my burrito and stare at him with a fake smile that say's I don't care, burrito for life. Joe then continues, \"I saw you on [redacted] snap chat last night, I liked the cat t-shirt, it fits your personality, but [redacted] is never going to date you, she likes dogs.\" \n\nDispatch: \"Code 2, domestic, caller states her ex-boyfriend is outside the house attempting to get in.\"\n\nI look at Joe, he sighs, and keys up and takes the call. I hear another unit back him up immediately, Tony. I look at Joe, \"Hey man I arrested the pregnant lady on that domestic, so I got one more arrest than you.\"  \n\nJoe calmly states, \"Yeah, she told you she hit him, amazing arrest, officer of the year here.\" \n\nI respond with, \"Be safe, Tony is probably already on scene, writing the report.\" He smiles, Tony writes everything, so Joe knows he's just there to keep it \"safe\" by him yelling at ignorant people. \n\nAbout ten minutes go by and I hear a code 4, given by Joe. \n\nDispatch: Code 2, caller states vehicle is on fire on the interstate. \n\nI realize the district is tied up and I'm going to be taking the fire on the interstate, yay, easy call to end the night. I key up, \"Unit 311, drop me that code 2.\" \n\nI turn the radio up, it's 311, Amber, just kidding, that has never happened since I got the number 311, but I do love the band and Amber, since I was a college frat boy at one time...\n\nInstead I'm listening to Taylor Swift, Bad Blood, whatever, I dig T.Swift, and start blasting it out of the parking lot heading to the interstate. I weave in and out of traffic with my lights and sirens, I place my burrito in my bag covered in tin-foil, safely seat belted, always maintain safety of the burrito. \n\nI arrive on scene and see a silver Infinity G36 engulfed on fire with a local IMAP unit, the guys that have giant billboards on their trucks telling people to move a lane over. He looks at me, \"Officer [redacted] good to see you man, it's been a while!\" I look at him and smile, \"Yeah since yesterday's hilarious two vehicle minor bumper crash on the interstate, where's the driver of the vehicle on fire?\" \n\n\"They are further up the road, in front of the vehicle, near the on ramp, \" He responds. I look over my scene, I'm currently sitting in the middle lane of a three-lane highway with a lot of congestion from the vehicle fire. I'm also on the biggest major bridge connecting my city with another city, so yeah, this is going to suck. \n\nFire shows up and they start battling the vehicle fire, I stop all the traffic on the interstate as the firefighters are dealing with the vehicle fire, to help keep them safe.  15 minutes go by and it seems the fire is almost stopped except for one tiny last pocket of fire. \n\nI see the firefighters glancing at each other. There hose turns off and I look at the Captain of the Ladder, he states to me, \"We are out of water, and going to head back to refill. We'll be back in a few minutes.\" I look at him and ask where are the other Ladders and Engines. \"They are caught in traffic trying to get here, and can't get to us due to the congestion,\" he says as he gets back on to the Ladder. \n\n\"Well give me a firefighter as collateral,\" I jokingly ask. \n\nThe Captain responds, \"Actually firefighter [redacted] will stay with you guys.\" I look at firefighter A, covered in his gear sweating profusely, he smiles at me, we share a nod, we had worked quite a few crashes and medical call together. I go back to my unit and retrieve a Gatorade and my burrito and start eating while I watch the vehicle burn. \n\nI ask Firefighter if he wants a Gatorade, \"After this fire is died down,\" he responds. I look back at the fire as the vehicle is burning and the magnesium popping every few seconds, smoke lingers in the air and I look back and see a light of vehicles completely stopped cause I had to shut down an interstate. Thousands of vehicles are stopped as I'm halfway up on a bridge that has a steep elevation. I hate the interstate and especially elevated places, but this bridge is an absolute death trap. \n\nAbout ten minutes go by and I see the Ladder returning coming the wrong way down the interstate, they kill the fire in about 15 minutes. It's been about 40 minutes since I shut off the interstate. Everyone but the captain takes a Gatorade from me, the Captain politely refuses, who say’s all cops hate hose draggers?\n\nIt's time for me to go home, as the vehicle fire was under control and the firefighters were checking the vehicle. We open up two lanes of the highway, I drive back on the other side of the interstate and see a traffic jam roughly 10 miles long at least. I think to myself, when's the last time you messed over that many people's day by shutting down an interstate? Been a while, the vehicle is towed later by the owner, the vehicle's tires had melted off and the vehicle was partially fused to the bridge. I enjoyed my brownie on the way back to the station. ",

There was an access road of sorts, that used to be the main road, and then the new road.  Well, traffic on the new road was pretty bad and the \"access road\" was totally clear, so of course, what do people do?  Drive across the grass to get on the access road, of course.  I'm sitting there, actually considering doing the same because traffic is simply not moving, there was an accident up ahead.  I decided not to, as it is illegal, and soon enough, traffic started moving.  I get up over the hill and see a State Trooper with about 10 cars all lined up, going down, giving them each a ticket.  As more people cross the grass, he steps out in the road, points for them to pull over in the line and then carries on giving tickets.  One of the best \"instant justice\" type of moments i have ever seen.",

        "text": "*Friday 11:00 A.M.*\n\nI was sitting in my unit, currently working an overtime detail before my shift enjoying a cold iced coffee and a blue berry muffin. I was currently hungover from an extensive night out downtown with a couple of my buddies from my academy. \n\nDispatch: Code 2, caller states his trailer is on fire on the interstate. \n\n\"Unit 317, drop me that code 2.\" I hear Michael take the call, he works the morning shift and is a seasoned veteran with 15 plus years on the job. Michael is the exception to most officers I know with that much time on the job, most older guys are very bitter and disappointed with the department, but not Michael nothing phases the man, I want to be like him one day but I already feel the saltiness encroaching on myself. \n\nA few minutes go by and I hear Michael key up with his normal sense of calm, \"Unit 317 to dispatch I have been informed by Fire we are going to shut down both sides of the interstate this is a tractor trailer fire with corrosive chemicals aboard, notify the State Troopers, Hazmat Fire, Traffic, and start me everyone on a code 2, M'am.\" Michael was so calm, I would have been a little more vocal on the radio. The district comes alive and I hear the additional units clearing from their activities and heading to unit 317.\n\nI key up and start myself that way as the interstate ran through my overtime detail and Michael needed every vehicle possible. I head up on the interstate, going the wrong way, which is a surreal feeling even with lights and sirens, the interstate had been shut down by one unit on the adjacent side but he needed an additional unit. We were pushing traffic out of the interstate and onto an on-ramp going the wrong way. \n\nI'm roughly 200 yards from the trailer and see it on fire with a very thick black cloud being emitted. I see Hazmat working the fire as best they can, it was a semi-trailer that carried liquids that had imploded kinda like [this](https://makeagif.com/i/AdUxfg).\n\nMy radio key's up, \"317 to the units on the others side of the interstate get back an additional 400 yards, push traffic back even further!\" Michael had an additional stress on his voice I had never heard so I knew he was very serious. My self and the other officer moved our vehicles back to the very limit of where we could be to push traffic as far back as we could. \n\nState troopers started showing up on scene and removing our units off the scene, they would be primary on the report. Two State troopers come up on us from the rear, a tall man with his special hat gets out and with a big southern draw states, he's got us. I nod at him and look at his partner, \"Oh shit hey John!\" I had worked an event with John, John had 20 years on me but was a very cool down to earth state trooper, always very respectful. I catch up with John and then head back to my little section for my overtime. Side note John was always pushing me to join the dark side and become a State Trooper, they do have nice hats I guess...\n\nI see Michael later in the day as his shift is ending and he was covered in dust. He laugh and talks with his Texas accent, \"Boy that was one truck fire for the ages. The fire department shows up on scene and take one look at the trailer's stickers and say immediately to me get everyone out of the area! They scared the hell out of me! I even have a hazmat book somewhere in my vehicle, but have never looked at it till today, that's why I told you guys to back up.\" \n\nAs I'm loading up my unit I look in my bag and make sure I have my hazmat book, its still in the side pocket where I left it, I hope it stay's there for a long time.

        "text": "I'm sitting in my vehicle at my favorite spot, \"the church,\" with my partner, Joe. Joe was sitting in the passenger seat eating his jellybeans, between bites Joe states the following, \"You know if I do become a detective one day, I'd like to be the jellybean detective. That way when someone lies to me I can tell them that this jellybean tastes like popcorn and I love a good show.\" \n\nI look at Joe, \"What if it's licorice?\" \n\nJoe responds with, \"I'd spit it in the customers face, obliviously.\" (The customer referring to a lying witness or false reporter.)\n\nI laughingly respond, \"Oh I see you went to the same school as Detective Butler, you know his go to sign is to start laughing at the customer and then yell at them with a half-written citation from the 90's for falsifying a police report. Works quite a bit though.\" \n\nPop, Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop, Joe and I immediately stop laughing and start trying to figure out where the gun shots came from. Joe states, \"That sounds like it came from behind the church!\" I exit the church parking lot and start driving behind the church and going up a side road, there are quite a few apartments in the area. I drive up on a white Infinity G36 with the driver side door open and the driver window shot out. \n\n\"Joe that Infinity has some bullets in the driver side, get the AR out and let’s clear it.\" Joe gets his Ar-15 out and we sweep the vehicle, there's some marijuana in the driver seat, the vehicle has heavy tint on all the windows. Joe yells, \"Clear!\" \n\nI get on the radio, unit 306, we have shots fired at 5th Street, please advise me if we get any shots fired or calls for a shooting from the hospital.\n\nDispatch: 10-4 unit, will advise. \n\nJoe and I start looking around, the apartment complex is quite and then all of sudden someone starts yelling, \"THEY SHOT UP MY APARTMENT!\" \n\nJoe and I start running towards the apartment and then we meet a gate that can't be opened unless you know the code or have a key card. We do not have either, so we are sitting in limbo with our AR-15's yelling at the people inside the apartment to come out and meet us at the gates. \n\n\"OH hell no, how do I know you are the cops?\" Joe and I look at each other, not an unreasonable request, I go back to my vehicle and hit the sirens, the woman immediately comes out and lets us in. She's yelling, \"They shot my T.V.!\" I look at her incredulously, and ask if anyone is shot, she says her neighbor said someone shot her boyfriend, but she didn't see them as she was inside her apartment hiding. I'm dumbfounded by this woman as she should have lead with that, but she says she heard the shooting and some commotion afterwords. \n\nJoe and I start banging on the door to the neighbor with no response. Joe gives me a signal that he is going to kick the door down, the lady seeing this says, \"Stop! I have a key!\" We open the door with the key and scan the apartment and clear it, find some blood on the ground but nothing else. \n\nDispatch: Unit 306, U of H Hospital states they have a black male shot in the leg and arm on location, I respond with a 10-4. \n\nA neighboring district that runs on our channel key's up and ask which district that shooting is in, Dispatch states not your district sir, with a heavy accentuation on the sir for the sergeant. The neighboring sergeant’s district has the highest shootings in the department, so it’s reasonable to believe that the shooting was in his district.  Dispatch is kinda newish so she doesn't know that yet, but she definitely will in time. \n\nJoe and I share a quick smile at that interaction over the radio. I key up and start asking for my rank, my Lt. responds he is on his way. Our gang unit sergeant key's up and states he's on scene. Our gang/drug sergeant is always quick to be on shooting scenes as most of the time he knows it’s probably drug related or gang related. \n\nMy rank and Detective Butler show up on scene, Joe and I numb to working quite a few shooting and homicide scenes start writing down information when my Lt looks at me and say's why the hell is my two-man writing this report? Where is my recruit car? I shrug my shoulders and he gets on the radio and calls out the FTO, she's quite lazy about writing reports that aren't pro-active police work. She shows up with her recruit, who is ecstatic to be writing an aggravated battery by shooting report. New officers love writing the “cool” stuff. \n\nJoe and I clear the scene and go back to the church, another quiet Saturday done in the books. The man shot survived his wounds and is currently residing in the hospital until he is healthy enough to be released and go to jail for two open warrants, Domestic Abuse Battery on his girlfriend (the one that drove him), and a theft warrant. We later discovered in his vehicle a hand gun under the passenger seat and quite a bit of marijuana stashed under the rear seats.  ",

We look up some maps to get him started on the right direction. He thanks us again, we thank him again, and just as I turn my body cam off thinking the encounter was over, he switches into story mode and begins telling us about his time in the jungle.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but if I have the time I am all for hearing a good story, no matter how tall the tale. We had the time (none of the fish were biting anyway) and he told a good tale or three. Toward the end of his harrowing narrative he told us about the things he left in the jungle, and the things that came back home with him. Normally from a horrific time like that war you would hear about traumas, inescapable madness, lost humanity and failed attempts at drowning regrets for lack of alcohol. Not from this fella. He left fifty pounds in that jungle (he lost a ton of weight!), but told us he paid for each pound with another year of impetigo and proceeded to lift his shirt to show us his fifty-year rash.\n\nAgain, maybe it's just me, but if I have the time I am all for researching a medical condition no matter how familiar I am with it. Sorry if the car and everything in my immediate vicinity smelled like bleach and Lysol, third shift. It's a service you'll thank me for later, trust me.\n",

It was summer and I also had my first real job at a restaurant.\n\nLate Saturday night, early Sunday and I am out of work but awake and decided to drive around Boston before heading home to my/my parents house in the suburbs.\n\nI drive up this one \"U\" shaped alley that I had found (rare free parking spaces in Boston, it fills up quick in the day but empty at this time of the morning).  Empty except for a mid-size dark colored sedan with two guys in suits sitting in it idling against the curb.\n\nI was curious so instead of heading away when I exited the alley I took a left and went into it again, this time I slowed down and it was obvious I was looking at these two and they were looking back at me.  I think this is where I went wrong...I went back a third time for one more look (I think in my teen mind I was figuring these were mob guys or something so no idea what I thought I was doing!).\n\nAfter the third pass I take a left out of the alley and come to a stop at a red light figuring it's time to head home.  Just after I stop at the red light I am surrounded by police cars, a couple of riot vans.  Some police are in uniform with handguns drawn and pointed at me, a bunch were in SWAT gear maybe?  Bullet proof vests sporting shotguns anyway.\n\nI get pulled from the car, handcuffed, questioned and put into the back of a police car.  For about an hour the police figuratively take my car apart and put it back together again.\n\nFinally I get taken from the police car and a guy I think of as the general (he had ribbons or something on the front of his uniform none of the other guys had) stands in front of me with an angry look, hands me my keys and tells me to get the hell out of Boston and to not come back.\n\nAnd that's how I kind of got banned from Boston (I mean, even as a young naive kid I kind of knew there was no official \"ban\" from me going to the city).\n\nI've always wondered what I might have stuck my unwanted nose into.  The number of people, vehicles and drawn guns involved makes me think it was more than just a couple of bored police officers deciding to scare a nosy teenager.  ",

        "text": "No matter who you are, what agency you work for, or your location on the globe, there are certain individuals that you keep running into. Everyone has at least one “That Guy”. No, not the DnD That Guy. Usually he’s /r/FloridaMan material. Sometimes he’s a truly awful person, but most times he’s not. He’s probably got a history with your agency that goes back well beyond the start of your career, and beyond the birth date of most redditors. The first time you dealt with him, wide-eyed and surprised, you probably ran and told one of the old, salty vets on your shift, who just chuckled and told you that “Yup, that sounds like him”. I was no exception, and my introduction to one of our local repeat customers was certainly memorable. We’re gonna call him Jack, for no particular reason.\n\nActually, that’s not accurate. Jack is called Jack because he liked to drink. Jack especially liked to drink his namesake that came in square bottles with black labels, at least when he could afford to get his hands on it. More often than not, Jack would just make do with whatever bottom-shelf, plastic-bottle swill he could get his hands on, but that’s not really important. Was is important was that this individual, like so many who enter the criminal justice system, probably had no business drinking. In this particular case, it was due to a combination of poor drunken behavior, and some serious health issues. Jack really hadn’t learned his lesson over the years, and his records were testament to that. Our current computerized system has only been in place about 5 years, but the old digital records going back to the early 2000’s were imported. In Jack’s case, someone had painstakingly added all of his paper records to the system, and as a result one can find system cautions with posting dates from the Reagan era.\n\nJack came to me for the first time on a night just like any other. He arrived early in my shift, and being too drunk to be processed, went into the rubber room to sleep it off where we could still keep an eye on him. Nothing notable happened for several hours as he slept peacefully, until at about 0300 when we sent another inebriated individual into the box to get his beauty rest. Jack didn’t budge until we slammed the cell door closed, the loud metallic crash waking him from his intoxicated fog. A few minutes later, he appeared at the window, gently tapping for attention. I walked to the door, where I could smell the booze coming off of him even through the closed door.\n\n“Paper?” he queried through the inches-thick glass, steel and foam. I must have given him a confused look, because he repeated his question. “Paper!? Toilet paper!” He threw up his hands in a confused gesture, acknowledging his accommodation’s lack of sanitary products. I quickly returned with a roll and opened his tray slot, where he graciously accepted his prize. In my coffee-deprived, 3 AM mind, however, I failed to consider one major flaw with this decision. You see, the rubber room is also what is referred to as a “dry cell”. That means no sink, and more importantly, no toilet. There’s a hole in the floor with a grate over it, which is fine if you need to take a leak, but for solid waste disposal it’s not a great option. It’ll work in a pinch, but I (and the inmates) prefer to pull people out to a normal cell for that need if the option is available. My sleepy, decaffeinated brain chose to ignore this fact though, and Jack either didn’t mind or was still to intoxicated to care. I returned to post and went back to forcing myself to stay awake.\n\nMy psudeo-slumber was interrupted about twenty minutes later by the trustee’s loud exclamations. “Aw, damn! What are you doing, man? Don’t do – oh hell no.” I looked up to see the pained expression on his face. “Old boy’s taking a shit in the rubber cell, man.” I craned my neck to see Jack hunched over, looking behind him at his girthy production. Worse still, he had missed the hole in the floor by a good two or three feet. He turned back to me and shrugged, pulling up his pants that he really hadn’t managed to get down in the first place. Suddenly, my nose was assaulted by the worst smell imaginable. I don’t know what Jack had been eating on the outside, but it produced an odor that burned in my nose and made my eyes water. I ran to the door and slammed the tray slot shut, but it was too late – the smell had escaped. My coworkers started to complain and a female that was being processed gasped and gagged. My vision went blurry as my eyes filled with tears. At that moment, I would have preferred to have had a face full of OC than to have to smell this hellish scent. It also probably would have had less effect. \n\nAs other inmates and officers scrambled to get near a ventilation source, I made a mad dash back to my post. You know how when stuff goes really wrong in the hospital, they rub the peppermint oil on a cold mask so that’s all you smell? We don’t really have that. The best I could come up with was some hand sanitizer, which I smeared under my nose in the hope that it might clean the air of the noxious odor. My nose was dry and cracked at the corners because I had been fighting off a cold, and the alcohol stung and burned my skin. I couldn’t care less, because it offered a brief respite from smelling something that was more at home in a sewage pipe than anywhere else. I turned to see the trustee at the cell door, holding his nose, and waving frantically to get Jack’s attention. “Get it in the hole, man! You gotta get it in the hole!” He frantically pushed the flush button on the exterior of the cell, hoping to encourage Jack to get the hint. He turned to me and shook his head. “Man, he gotta get it all in the hole. He gotta push it or something.” He turned back briefly before exclaiming again and walking away in disgust. “Aw HELL naw. Not like that, cuz. Nasty ass god damn…” He trailed off as he went to fetch cleaning supplies, drawing the attention of the sergeant, who was coming to investigate the rancid odor.\n\n“What’s he doing, Muff_Huffer?” Prompted by the sarge, I nervously approached the door and peered in the window. What I saw was a scene from a horror film. A three foot long, one foot wide smear lay across the floor of the rubber room. The offending substance was piled haphazardly on top of the grate, mixed with toilet paper. I don’t know why Jack had bothered to ask for the roll, however, because he had applied most of the fecal matter to himself. Caked up to both elbows in his own excrement, it dotted his face and hair where he had scratched himself. There was a trail down the back of his dirty sweatpants and at the bottom of his threadbare thermal shirt. He looked up at me in shock and with indignance, and shrugged, before asking “What? It’s fine.” I shook my head and sighed. “Jack, you gotta clean up a little, bud.” He scoffed. “I’m….fffffine. I’m just…in here, and I just wanna go back to sleep!” I reached for my keys and told him, “Nah man, you gotta get cleaned up. I’m not trying to leave you in there all covered in poop, man.” Jack shook his head and waved his hands dismissively. “Nah, I just wanna stay here. It’s fine.” He stood and turned away.\n\nThen, to my ultimate horror and revulsion, he dropped his pants, squatted and did it again. Same spot. Even more poop. While I watched.\n\nI still have nightmares.\n\nDirty deed done for the second time, I couldn’t tear myself away. It was like watching a bad car accident, when you know you shouldn’t look but you’re so astounded by the violation of the laws of nature that’s happening in front of you that you’re almost compelled to keep watching. Bare ass still hanging out, Jack stood and turned, then bent back over and smeared his second set of turds across the floor and began to smash them through the grate with his bare hands. I swore and knocked on the window. “Dude! At least use the toilet paper!” Jack scoffed and waved his hands again, inadvertently flinging miniscule poop flecks around the cell. This time, his production was looser and less solid, more wet sand than modeling clay like the first one. I screamed silently and turned to the sergeant. I looked apologetically at her and weakly offered, “He…he just did it again.” Sarge looked at me quizzically. “He pooped on the floor a second time, Sarge. He smeared it all over himself and the damn floor. I…I don’t know what else to say.”\n\nSarge looked blankly at me and blinked a few times. “Well…I guess we gotta get him out and clean him up.” The next few minutes were a haze. The unfortunate duty of dressing Jack in his jail clothes fell to me, and after being given several minutes in a bathroom to clean himself up, I had to strip search Jack as part of the booking process. It was here that I discovered he didn’t do as good a job as he thought he did, and despite taking a shower later that night, Jack’s case of mudbutt persisted. I did my best to block those scenes out from my memory, but Jack had left a momento behind – the raw odor of his vile expulsion. Despite the trustee (in a full hazmat suit, no less) throwing every cleaning product in our arsenal at the cell, the smell lingered for hours. It also spread to our new, temporary drunk tank cell, where Jack and his roommate (who slept through the whole thing) had to be moved. The smell hung around for so long and was so bad that it even eventually permeated the virtually sealed control box next to my post, who called me about an hour later asking if the sewer line was backed up again. Someone took pity on me and came up with a can of Febreeze, which I distinctly remember spraying non stop until the can was empty. The remaining few hours of my shift passed without further incident, but the damage was done. Scared and disturbed, I went home that morning with the image of Jack taking his second deuce burned into my brain.\n\nA few days later, I regaled a sergeant on another shift with my harrowing tale of Jack and the giant dung drop. Expecting shock, horror and revulsion, I was instead surprised when he simply gently nodded at the end of the story. “Yup,” he said to me.\n\n“That sounds like him, alright.”\n",

        "text": "It was 23:45, I was unloading my gear from my unit to my personal vehicle. I'm talking to my buddy Spencer, we were joking about a crash we had worked earlier in the day that was an absolute cluster fuck that took me three hours to get everything straightened out, 6 vehicles, four tows, and a lot of paperwork.\n\nDispatch: \"Code 2, unknown trouble at Third street. Caller states ex-girlfriend on location causing a disturbance.\" \n\n\"Drop that code 2,\" Unit 383 says quietly on the radio, Unit 383 is one of my closest friends in the academy. We spent a lot of time together joking about soccer since he was from Brazil and I love soccer. \n\nSome minutes pass by and I'm talking to my rank about the accident and the cluster fuck of paperwork. I hear my radio go off. \n\nUnit 383, \"I'm on location.\" \n\nA few more minutes go by and then my buddy starts yelling on the radio, preface we are all rookies at this point and hadn't seen much yet, \"Foot pursuit, suspect has a knife, start me additional units!\"\n\nI'm about to get off but me and another one of my buddies jump into a rank vehicle and start driving, and driving fast. Another unit is ahead of us and we are flying up a road with a lot of bumps.\n\nWhen I say fast, I'm not gonna type speeds but lets say we were flying. As we get to a big bump, I tell my buddy driving swerve to the left there's a huge bump, my buddy swerves. The vehicle in front of us does not swerve. His units goes air born by at least a foot and comes back down sparks flying everywhere from the impact of the undercarriage with the street. \n\nUnit 383, \"Uh I'm behind the suspect and she's refusing commands.\n\nWe arrive on scene in about three minutes and see my buddy holding his taser at the uncooperative women holding a long steak knife. I get my gun out and yell at unit 383, \"I got the shot, take her with taser!\" \n\nThe woman screams, \"DON'T TASE ME! PLEASE DON'T! and drops the knife. We handcuff crazy lady and I give my buddy (unit 383) a look of you could have easily taken her. Side note he did the right thing of waiting but unit 383 is a black belt in Jitjsu and this woman was soaking wet 135lbs and would have had her ass handed to her by unit 383. I know that from personal experience as I had boxed him earlier in the year in the academy. After 30 seconds I was on the ground asking myself what had just happened, after landing an excellent punch to his face I was lying down on a red matt with my Sergeant over me saying, \"It's okay son everyone gets handed an ass whopping, it's even happened to me.\"\n\nAfterwords we learned that crazy lady was having problems with her ex-boyfriend and was trying to get attention. She was arrested for a bunch of stuff. Unit 383 was laughing the next day saying when it became a pursuit he was about 30 yards away and closed it very quickly and got on the radio and then called for help when she wouldn't put down the knife. Unit 383 is also the holder of third fastest time in the department for the 300 meter. \n\nMy buddy that went air born with the unit never got into trouble but we learned our vehicle cameras activate the second they sense the vehicle is air born. We laughed about that later and learned to swerve on that street and that ridiculous bump. ",

        "text": "It's generally agreed upon that aside from your gun, your most important tool is your radio. And on the other side of that radio is your dispatcher. We literally trust them with our lives. That means when they're in training, or just bad at their jobs, the troops on the street get angry quickly. And when they're good at their jobs, we love to work with them.\n\nI was rolling down a side street when my car's license plate reader (LPR) got a hit. That meant it saw something that was either a stolen car, a stolen plate, an armed and dangerous car, or some combination of the above. And where I worked, it was usually an abandoned stolen car. We'd get 2 or 3 a day.\n\nI couldn't tell exactly where it came from, so I turned around and found it. It was a parked car that looked completely normal. I stopped behind it and in the lane next to it, advised dispatch of my location, and told them to run a plate that may be stolen. The windows were blacked out all around, so I couldn't tell if anyone was in it, but it looked empty.\n\n\"Unit 2 to dispatch, I'm at 2nd Street and Oak Street...in Madison.\" I specified the city, knowing that there was an identical location in another city I covered. Dispatch echoed it back, confirming in Madison.\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2...that plate is returning one stolen Toyota, armed and dangerous warning. Confirm it's not occupied?\"\n\nWell...I don't think it's occupied. \"Affirm, not occupied.\" But let's make sure.\n\nI drew my gun, aimed at the low ready (in between straight down and at the car), and started yelling at the car. \"Driver! Show me your hands!\" People at the baseball field nearby started looking at me. No movement at the car.\n\n\"Driver, open the door and put your hands up!\" Nothing from the car. Another unit caught the tail end of the \"armed and dangerous\" transmission, and asked dispatch, \"Is anyone en route to assist Unit 2?\" Dispatch told him that the car was unoccupied. And I didn't tell dispatch I was currently clearing the car.\n\nThere was a few options available to me. Of course, I went with the dumbest one. I walked up to the car, gun drawn, and grabbed the door handle. I was either right or really wrong. I threw the door open and...it was empty.\n\n\"Unit 2 to dispatch, start me a tow truck for the recovery.\" Half an hour later, my tow truck still wasn't there. I checked the computer to see what the delay was. It showed my location as the next town over. The town I specifically didn't want dispatch to think I was in.\n\n\"Unit 2 to dispatch. I'm in Madison.\"\n\nDispatch keyed up the microphone. \".......Unit 2, I copy, I'll update the tow.\" She knew she screwed up. \n\nHad that vehicle been occupied, my screw up of not waiting on a second unit combined with her screw up of putting me in the wrong city could've been disastrous. But we live and learn...fortunately.",

        "text": "When I was little and still learning to ride my bike, I wanted the training wheels kept on for much too long.  I wasn't confident enough to try without them, and I thought they would protect me from any crashes.  They didn't.\n\nI overbalanced while riding down the street on my block and fell right into the neighbor's garden.  It was full of prickly pear cactus.  Covered with great big thorns.  I couldn't move, because every time I did, I'd get more perforated.\n\nA squad car just happened to drive by right then and the officer jumped out and plucked me from the cactus.  He then carried me, this screaming, snotty kid, to my house down the block.\n\nI've never forgotten this, and I wish I knew who he was so I could thank him.  Since I can't, I want to thank you for doing good things in the world.",
