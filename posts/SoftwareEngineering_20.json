So I have a command handler and 1 or more event handlers, running on different JVMs, containers etc, and at some point one of these handlers encounters an error.\n\nWe have two cases, an 'expected' business error and an 'unexpected' system error.  As I understand it, we are now in an asynchronous handler, and the event is now a fact, so in reality we cannot directly rollback the command for neither case (as it could entail rolling it back in numerous other projections and break CQRS).\n\nSo my question is, should such an error be 'resolved' in an accounts ledger sort of way, i.e. by sending a new 'reversal' command that is then propagated to the projections in such a way that the event that failed is now resolved?\n\nAs an example, let's say we have a command that updates a customer's credit.  The event is published, one projection updates its \"total credits\" statistic, another one publishes the update to some websocket for the UI and, finally, another one which maintains the credit state - and this last handler fails.  Should we send a command for rolling back the business transaction, and again deduct the credit, update the websocket again, etc?  And in case of axon is there some way in which this is captured as a transaction?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI studied applied computer science until recently. I was always self-taught and besides my studies I taught myself how to program and I also wanted to work as a software developer later on. Since 3 months I am now a software developer in a big company.\n\nI know that this means that you have to learn lifelong and always stay up to date. On the other hand, I feel overwhelmed by the way you're supposed to be. I always liked to continue programming at home during my studies. But I find it incredibly difficult to go home and keep programming, reading books or reading 100 blog posts after an 8 hour job. \n\nBut others always say you wouldn't be a \"real software developer\" if you didn't like programming at home. I really like software development (programming itself and relevant topics around it) but I just can't keep programming after a long daily job session. I also have other hobbies that I would very much like to do or just sit back after a long working day and do something with my family, friends, girlfriend etc. But currently it's more like I've a fixed daily schedule which looks similar to:\n- 8 hours work\n- 8 hours sleep\n- 2 hours housework (+shopping)\n- 2 hours fitness (I consider it important for my health)\n- 2 hours learning and programming at home (\"staying up 2 date\")\n- 2 hours way to work (2x 1h)\n\n = 24 h (Hobbies? 0h)\n\nHow do you manage this situation? I'm someone who really is/was motivated in learning everyday. But right now this kind of schedule leads me to burnout instead of a life I'd want to live for around 50 years.\n\nAnd how do you figure out which books are really a must-read-book and which are not? Person A says that there are 100 MUST-READ-books, person B names 200 different \"MUST-READ\"-Books and I'm honestly sometimes reading 100 books while I've already forgotten 80% of the old ones. I'm not talking about \"learning C#\" or \"learning vue.js\", though. It's more about those advanced books of \"special tips and tricks\" which I just can't remember forever (why are those books even must-read-books if I forgot most of it anyways, because I dont apply it everyday?).

        "text": "Hey Reddit\n\nI am currently studying physics at my 2nd year. During the last year we have been doing a lot of programming and I really enjoyed it. We have mainly used MatLab and Python and I'm learning Java on my own right now.  I have been looking to change to software engineering in the last few months, due to the fact that I'm tired of \"only\" learning the theoretical concepts and not applying it to anything. I have been loving the coding part so much, because you write a simulation or small program and see the results right away. \n\nHowever, the reason I'm writing is because, I wanted ask what more I should expect from a software engineering degree. I'm sure a lot of people love to code and choose SE for that reason, but I'd love to know what surprises you came across or would have loved to know before starting.\n\nAlso, if I were to change, I'd probably focus on cyber security or robotics.  If any of you have any experience in these fields, I would love to hear from  you!  Or just what fields are currently hot :\\)\n\nCheers!",
