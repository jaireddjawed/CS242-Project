I am not sure this post is within the rules, so I'm sorry if not, but I would seriously appreciate any advice anyone can give me!\n\nI graduated last year with an Anthropology degree with a focus in Archaeology. As a result of world events, I still haven't done my field school (I was supposed to in 2020). I did an online \"field school\" over zoom during the pandemic, but that is not enough to get an entry level archaeology job in the USA (that I have found, so far). I was planning to do my field school next summer, but I just found out I might be losing my job to an outsourcer (long story...) which means I will have to find a 'real' job that will probably not allow me to take a month off next summer. There is an opportunity for a winter field school that I have found that I could do January- February in Ireland, but the thing is, it does not include excavation- only surveying and lab work. This is appealing to me because I could get it out of the way, and then possibly work in archaeology in the spring and summer season.\n\nMy questions is: Would an in person field school that does not include excavation be a waste of time? Or will it give me the qualifications I need to work in the archaeology field in the US? I would love any ideas or pointers anyone can give me. I am starting to feel like I wasted my time with my archaeology degree as it seems that there is always another requirement that I still haven't met that prevents from actually working.",

        "text": "Hi!\n\n**I am trying to find books on the hunter-gatherer/forager lifeway.** I have been interested in this topic for several years now, as time has permitted. I am trying to find a particular kind of book. I have, and have been very slowly reading through, Cambridge's *Encyclopedia of Hunter-Gatherers, Kelly's The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers*, and Fitzhugh's *The Evolution of Complex Hunter-Gatherers*. I have a couple books on ecology and civilization lined up such as Prentiss &amp; Kuijt's *Complex Hunter-Gatherers*, Harris' *Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches*, Oxford's Very Short Introductions on Ecology and Aristocracy, some few others books about human status and hierarchy, and few others that are more historical or topical. All of these books are either highly theoretical or technical, or are more like journals or anthologies of technical articles.  **What I'm trying to find is something that is less heavily technical and more wholistic.** Somewhat like an ethnography. I tried to read that book about Nisa, the southern African hunter-gatherer from the !Kung (?) \\[IIRC\\], but that was kind of boring and old (from the 60s!) I'm curious about hunter-gatherers and their cultures and ways of life, not so much how much people a hectare can support or how nightly temperatures effect eye color over the generations (ok, that one was a little over the top, but only a little). Technicality and theory, are, of course, valid, but not what I'm looking for. I have googled this question a lot, but I have only gotten one or two things that match. Basically, long context aside, does anyone know of **ethnographies or ethnographic-like books/movies etc., about hunter-gatherer peoples, cultures, and ways of life--especially complex \\~ sedentary hunter-gatherers?**",

        "text": "I feel like this is a chicken or egg question.\n\nEven though much of musical appreciation is culturally based, it seems to me like there's an inherent, built-in appreciation of music that we can't help. Sometimes a piece of music is so great that it is immune to cultural shifts, and withstands the test of time..\n\nHere's why it seems like a chicken or egg scenario to me:\n\nIf musical appreciation came before music, then how did it evolve? Music doesn't occur in nature, and musical appreciation certainly isn't a selection pressure in the natural world. Did it emerge by accident, purely as an unintentional byproduct of other traits? It seems like a very elaborate trait to simply be a byproduct.\n\nOn the other hand, if music came before musical appreciation, then why did anyone create music? If we didn't have musical appreciation yet, and it had to evolve over tens of thousands of years, then, if anybody comes up with a song or melody, it would just sound like a bunch of random nonsensical noise to everyone, including the composer. Certainly you can't develop a whole artform, with the feedback mechanism of liking or disliking changes, to see how to improve, when it's all just a bunch of noise.\n\nSo, as far as I can tell, you need music to evolve inherent musical appreciation. But you need inherent musical appreciation to create music. So which came first, and how?\n\nIf I had to guess, the only thing I could come up with is a runoff sexual selection. Similar to how peacocks got their elaborate and beautiful, but highly impractical feather design was due to a runoff effect. Supposedly there was an initial attraction to slightly shiny feathers, that pressured males' feathers to be shinier, which in turn pressured females to be more attracted to shiny feathers (because if they weren't, then their male offspring wouldn't be able to attract females as effectively). This positive feedback loop gave us modern male peacocks. Similarly, perhaps ancient hominid women were attracted to males that had controlled, undulating warcries. This led to a runoff effect where males' warcries became more elaborate and developed structure, rhythm, and modulation. \n\nBut this is just me completely guessing, based on nothing. And without any expertise in biology or ancient human history.",

        "text": "I'm curious as to how the behaviour of creating meaningless yet strictly-adhered to rules would have been selected for in the evolutionary environment. By this I mean the tendency to create totally useless restrictions or novel behaviours that seems to pop up again and again in completely unrelated cultures the world over which I'm assuming would suggest that its an innate trait. For example the forgoing of pig-related products in Abrahamic traditions or the avoidance of consuming cows in Hinduism or even more senseless extreme behaviours such as the vow of silence monks undertake. It would seem that the underlying psychological substrate that would allow all these pointless possibly even disadvantageous behaviours to arise repeatedly  within disparate cultures should be selected AGAINST instead of being so ubiquitous. A possible explanation of this might be that they only arise in societies that have become developed enough to allow for novel uncontributing phenomena like this to occur because they are prosperous enough to accommodate them, possibly meaning that these logically unexplainable behaviours might be the gestational buds of some sort of cultural attempt to create new modes of innovative living that benefit the society in question (though they may be impossible to make sense of in their beginning stages such as the vow of silence or Judaic pork prohibition). Of course this is all my speculation and I'm just taking shots in the dark. I'd love to hear your speculations too.",

I don’t mean people who think a diet is moral because of health benefits per se—though there is a lot of overlap there—but because of various other moral reasons, such as ethical omnivores or veg/an diets, or the slow foods, food sovereignty, and locally grown foodways movements.\n\nI know that eating a certain way for moral reasons, even if it’s difficult or impractical, is very common in modern societies ranging from individual to society-wide scales. What examples do we have of people taking a strong moral stance on food choice before the modern world—maybe even to the point of inconvenience or health detriments?\n\nI would be interested in any examples because I know this topic could come from pretty much anywhere and anywhen in the world; I’m sure people have always been people and have always and will always continue to squabble about the virtues of whatever diet.

        "text": "In the documentary 'Out of the cradle' by NHK World, the latter part of the documentary focusing on sapien-neanderthal coexistence makes a point of the seemingly increased hostility of sapiens when compared to neanderthals supposedly due to considerably larger average group size and long-distance interactions with other groups of sapiens (this particular part of the documentary is spearheaded by Robin Dunbar). Presumably, this would mean earlier hominids with smaller brain size and thus smaller group size such as homo erectus would be less inclined to coalitionary violence (reminiscent of warlike behaviour) towards their fellow erectus'. Is this the current scientific consensus among anthropologists?",

        "text": "I'm no expert in anthropology, though I have studied human geography and some basic philosophy, too. \n\nI want to better draw the line between human nature and human culture, because I believe it'll better help me to approach politics. Specifically, if I better understand our human nature, then I'll be more-able to decide my beliefs regarding the free-market and state-regulation, etc... \n\n* Are people inherently fair, or inherently selfish? \n* Does society mitigate our negative traits and thus empower collaboration, or does society impose itself upon our freedoms, thus giving rise to our negative traits?\n* Does the world \"owe\" me anything, and am I obliged to give anything back to the world?\n* Does life have unalienable rights?\n\nI've heard of Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau's discourse regarding \"the \\[pure\\] state of nature,\" and I feel that this is a great place for my research to begin. With this as a foundational landscape, what were the circumstances that encouraged humanity to create our various cultures/societies? \n\nHere are some of my thoughts so far:\n\n* Resource Scarcity\n   * Because resources are finite, creatures must compromise with one another. Compromise/collaboration leads to ways that one 'ought' to act.\n* Domestication\n   * of fire, wheat, animals, etc. Collective settlement near renewable resources would have expanded our social circles and mutual dependencies upon one another. \n* Family structure\n   * People exist in various stages of competency and speciality (babies, young child, teen, adult, elderly, mother/father, grandmother/grandfather), and thus -- beyond collaboration -- individuals must complement one another, too. \n* Jaguars vs. Humans\n   * When a jaguar kills a sheep, it does not act immorally because (I presume) jaguar's do not act upon their values (culture); they act upon their instincts (nature). Humans, on the other hand, do act upon their values. \n      * Is this a matter of 'with great power comes great responsibility'? \n      * If so, what is it that gave us such power? Is it fire, and tools? The wheel &amp; axle, weapons, etc.? \n\n\\--------\n\nTo summarise: **what are the watershed events through our planet's biological- and cultural-evolution that gave rise to concepts of morality?**\n\nCheers :)",
