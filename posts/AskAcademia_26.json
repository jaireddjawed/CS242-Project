If this is the wrong place to ask, please let me know and I'd appreciate suggestions for where would be more appropriate.\n\nI have an American Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering from a \"prestigious\" engineering school.  I would like to pursue higher education in France, but have read that my degree is equivalent to a French Diplôme d'Ingénieur, which is in turn equivalent to a French Master's Degree.  Should I look for PhD opportunities, or should I just pursue a French Master's?  If anyone familiar with this system could give me their input, that would be much appreciated.\n\nMy GPA is not the best, but it's about standard for the University I attended.  Fluent in English and B1 in French, but I intend to be better by the time I move to France; I won't be able to move for at least another year or two for medical reasons.

I had done one of the weekly readings from class. This list wasn’t referred to in the assignment description, so I assumed it was to be written on any reading from the course. To be honest, I don’t see this as a major issue but I totally understand why I would receive a bad mark. I did the assignment very well (in my opinion as I consider myself to be an ok student), but when I emailed her to inform her of my mistake and ask if it can still be graded (or if a replacement can be submitted) she told me no and that it will not be graded. In addition, the two articles (the one I was supposed to do vs the one I did) are on the exact same topic!! So my reflection would’ve been very similar had I done the right article.  Do I deserve to get a 0 on this? I know I wrote the assignment on a reading that wasn’t on the list but I still completed it, shouldn’t I at least get a 50? Let me know your opinions!

I still wanted to follow up with her, because aside from the two professors who already said yes, she is my best choice (I have A+ in her class and she is the alum of my dream school), but I know she is teaching a lot of students and my recommendation request is rather late.

        "text": "So, I got a small nick on my right index finger. Nothing serious. Totally inane, right? Well... I've noticed that I'm able to type with my middle finger instead of my index finger, at the same exact speed and in the same exact way as I would with my index finger. This extends, apparently, to writing and gripping objects as well. I have no experience doing this before but yet it works intuitively. So, onto my question...\n\nAre there any scientific papers on this phenomena? I've seen other people doing something similar and it's actually incredibly interesting! I'm very interested in the mechanisms by which the human body somehow adapts the standard patterns for the index finger, for the middle finger instead - likely, falling under a field of neurology.\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "text": "So, a couple of years back, during my first semester in uni, I got caught cheating on an ”practice assignment” (which is the most stupid thing I’ve ever done), in a course. Because this was a ”practice assignment”, no disciplinary action was taken and no report was made. I admitted it to my professor, and she let me off with a verbal warning, and I got another opportunity to do the assignment. This was very unlike me. I was in a bad place in my life (both mentally and physically), and this was a wake-up call for me to set my life straight. I’m not making any excuses, I’m just explaining. This is the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life.\n\nLater, I changed my major to something completely different, worked hard, finished my bachelor’s, I’m now doing a master’s, it’s going great and I love it. I feel like I’ve found my thing.\n\nI love it so much that I want to continue doing this, so I’ve applied to PhD programs. But I feel like I shouldn’t do a PhD, I feel like a cheater. Even now, while doing my master’s I’ve considered dropping out, because I feel like a cheater. I feel guilty, I shouldn’t be here with these other people who unlike me have always worked hard. \n\nI’m just so ashamed of myself. I don’t know if I will get accepted, but if I do, I think I’m going to decline, so someone more deserving can get accepted.",

I was on that path, until I got a good look at the career prospects.  \n\nTo clarify, I go to a state school and very few students here have the kind of financial support that would allow them to pursue a career in academia. And my school is decent, but not particularly well-regarded academically. For the ten or so tenured positions in my field that open up every year, there's not a chance that someone from our school is going to have a decent shot at a tenured position.   \n\nYet, almost all of the professors I have taken graduate classes with (and a good number of the undergrad professors) are still actively encouraging students to pursue an academic track if they show any promise. \n\nAbout half of the undergrad classes in my department are now taught by adjuncts, and it's an absolutely brutal, exploitative situation to be in, but their presence seems to make no impact on the career realism in the rest of the department.  And there's no acknowledgement of alternate career paths at all.  It's academia or nothing.\n\nFor an MA program, this is somewhat understandable, as a higher percentage of students are probably older and better informed.  But (to me) it's unconscionable for undergrads to be put on this path as if it's a viable option for them, especially without any other career guidance.",

To be clear, I have signed no contract that I have to stay in this lab next semester. However, I know it’s generally frowned upon to leave a lab after 1 semester. After this semester, I am 100% certain that this is not the area of research I want to do, and since I am hoping to get a PhD, the quality of my undergrad research experiences are very important to me. In fact, I came to this college to do a specific type of research. I really want to reach out to other labs doing my desired area of research, but I am not sure whether to list my current lab as a reference to show that I now have research experience. The labs I want to join definitely prefer me to have research experience so that’s something I really want to be able to disclose, but I also don’t want to burn any bridges with my current lab in case I have to stay next semester. What should I do?\n\nTLDR: if I have only been in a lab for one semester and really want to leave to explore other areas of research, should I list my lab as a reference? It is the only research experience I have.",

        "text": "I got a job in a prestigious academic life science research lab. They’re a sister institution to a large university and have free flow of faculty and students in multiple grad programs. The lab I was hired in has multiple grad students and the institution is supportive of employees seeking advanced degrees. \n\nI start in a couple weeks and I’m wondering how long I should wait to mention that I’d like to do a graduate program and establish a timeline for that. I’m assuming this is understood that I want to pursue higher ed because they asked if that’s something I’d be interested in in my interview. \n\nIs there an etiquette in regard to how long I should wait to mention anything? \n\nAny advice is welcome.",

        "text": "The series of events as they took place-\n\n1. October 25: Emailed the professor (one of the pioneers of the field) to work under them. They replied within minutes that they had forwarded the request to one of their postdocs as it was their project I was interested in.\n2. November 5: The postdoc reached out to me saying that they are willing to talk about suitable projects.\n3. November 6: I emailed the postdoc accepting their offer and telling them my availability for discussion.\n4. November 21: After 2 weeks of no reply, I sent a reminder to the postdoc.\n\nAfter three days of sending the reminder, I received no response. I don't think I will ever hear back from the postdoc. They might have changed their mind.\n\nWhat options do I have? I don't want to pass on this opportunity. Should I wait a bit longer? Should I email the professor right away saying that the particular postdoc might not be comfortable working with me and whether they have someone else who can mentor me?\n\nThanks for the help!\n\nPS- I posted this on another sub, however, I was unable to get any response.",
