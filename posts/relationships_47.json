        "text": "My girlfriend [26F] is very smart. She is finishing up her degree. Has a 4.0 going into her final semester. We've been together for 4 years. Always impressed me with her knowledge but she is very, very insecure about her intelligence. She has to be perfect. She has to be the best.\n\nThis is fine for me [25M] 95% of the time, but there's this 5% that causes issues. For example, there are certain things we can't do together such as play strategy games (I'm a strategy game enthusiast) such as chess. I'm good at chess. Not competitively at all, but I can beat most casual players.\n\nThe first time we played chess, within 5 moves she has having a panic attack because I had a gameplan and she didn't and she knew she would lose. She views chess as a game of intellect so she starts bawling her eyes out (no hyperbole) and resigns. When she came back, she said she is never playing chess again. Thankfully, these are my personal hobbies so I play Catan and the like with friends and family so it's fine don't do this together.\n\nHowever, any instance where she feels \"stupid\", we find ourselves \"arguing\" when I'm just trying to provide help because she feels \"stupid\"... when she isn't dumb, people just make mistakes and I happen to have knowledge in the area I'm helping.\n\nWe haven't had issues like this for months, but today she realized her computer won't let her do certain functions because, \"her institution won't allow her\". I said that's odd because her college shouldn't control her computer.\n\nI look into it and when she got the laptop for school she registered it as a \"Work/School\" computer, and signed into her school email. I tried converting it to a personal account but it won't allow it because it is \"her college's computer\". So I found a forum and need to reset her computer to fix it.\n\nThrough this whole process she is denying she ever did that and her \"stupid Microsoft account\" must have done it all. I explained that's not how it works and that she must have made a mistake. She denied and denied and then eventually said, \"I thought since I use it for school, I was supposed to select the work/school option\".\n\nI said that makes total sense but I believe that's for work computers that are loaned to employees. But during this whole thing I'm getting argued with and now she is tense and won't talk because she feels \"dumb\". All I was trying to do was help... and I did help and fix the issue but she wouldn't allow herself to look \"dumb\" or that she made a mistake.\n\n\nWe rarely have these issues but I don't enjoy having the day's vibe and activities altered by the fact she is upset with me for acknowledging a mistake of hers and helping her fix it.\n\n\nHow do you all address partner insecurities and arguments/tension that stems from said insecurities?\n\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend IS very smart, but is human and makes mistakes. When she does and feels \"dumb\" she gets defensive and takes it out on others, albeit rarely.",

        "text": "My husband (26 M) and I (26 F) had a baby last April and had only been married for seven months before having her. We have been together for five years in total. We experienced a lot of marital issues in our first year of marriage. We ultimately decided to start going to counseling to work on our marriage.\n\nOur counselor is a male. It was mostly my decision to choose the gender because my husband was the most apprehensive about starting counseling. I felt like having a male counselor would make him feel more comfortable and safe, especially since I've had years of counseling experience, and gender did not bother me. Our counselor has been helping our marriage, and we have been much better at communicating over the last five months of counseling. However, in almost every session we have, our counselor will make comments to my husband, such as: \"Most guys don't want to spend time with their infant daughters, so I just want to give you credit (insert husband's name here)\" or \"Most guys don't care about their wife's feelings and so the fact that you consider her feelings in this situation is not what most guys do.\" Every session, there is a comment like this, and every time it happens, it bothers me more and more. It feels like my husband gets kudos for being a decent human being when I, as a woman, don't receive those comments because it feels like an expectation of gender. Comments that are gender-based are only given to my husband. I am grateful for my husband, and of course, it means a lot that he cares, but it doesn't feel very objective now, and I don't want to return to counseling.\n\nMy husband was so upset by this and told me it was selfish of me. He wants me to confront our counselor with this issue, but that conversation is one that I don't want to have. It's like when you experience the \"ick\" with a guy and lose attraction. My perception has changed, and it feels like our counselor favors my husband more. The biased nature of those comments tells me that it isn't worth pursuing further, at least with this counselor. As a compromise, I asked my husband if we could find a different counselor instead of confronting the one we have now, and he didn't want to do that. My husband made me feel like I was overreacting by saying I was just being selfish. I don't feel like I'm in a safe space anymore, especially when trying to be my most vulnerable. I don't want to pay for another session to confront him with this when I genuinely feel like this isn't the right person to help us anymore.\n\nAm I in the wrong for wanting to quit the counselor without confronting him?\n\nTLDR: My Husband and I have been doing couples counseling for five months and it's working, but I feel like our counselor is biased.",

About a month ago talked to him about how our lack of communication, lack of intimacy, lack of compatibility is making me very unhappy, and that I want to go to counseling and take a step back from our relationship. \n\nWe live together, so I asked that he sleep in the guest room until we either work it out (or don‚Äôt), but otherwise we are still friendly. Like we hang out with our mutual friends and watch tv together and such. \n\nSo this morning I woke up earlier than usual and had a morning appointment to go to. I decided to take advantage of the empty house and extra time and watched videos on my phone at FULL VOLUME, thinking I was alone. \n\nAfter, went downstairs to make breakfast, and notice his car is still there when I look out the kitchen window. Sneak back upstairs and open the cracked guest room door. He‚Äôs in bed. I called his name as a question (because he‚Äôs usually long gone to work) and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù with his eyes closed. I KNOW that he heard. There‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt. But he probably won‚Äôt say anything to me (which is part of the problem).\n\nI don‚Äôt really know whether to say something or just let it go unless he brings it up. All I know is that I‚Äôm mortified :)\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend was home when I was watching porn on full volume, I had no idea. Our sex life is nonexistent. Knowing he won‚Äôt confront me, should I say anything about it at all?",

        "text": "My ex (16m) and I (16f) broke up 5 days ago. He cheated on me, and yet claims that he ‚Äòtechnically didn‚Äôt cheat because he didn‚Äôt sleep with her‚Äô. I‚Äôve also seen him exchange messages with a friend regarding how he‚Äôd rather have another girl over me. He cheated point blank. He chose to entertain other girls while in a relationship knowing it was wrong. He broke up with me, and i‚Äôm so alleviated to be out of his life and him to be out of mine.\n\nHe‚Äôs behaving incredibly immaturely after I secured myself a date later this week. He went up to the guy I‚Äôm going on a date with and stared him down with a group of his friends before telling him that I was crazy and that he gave him ‚Äòpermission to date me‚Äô. \n\nAfterwards he texted me to talk and said he had my clothes. He lied, he didn‚Äôt have my clothes and instead begged to make things right with me. I sat there unfazed as he aired out his grievances and explained how he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt cheat‚Äô but I literally saw the messages between the two of them. I told him to get out of my life, that his feelings were a joke, and that there was no chance of us getting back together. He said he still thought there was a chance.\n\nBut after I sat there with him I just started crying. I completely broke down and let out all my pent up feelings. ‚ÄúI loved you so much‚Äù ‚ÄúYou betrayed me‚Äù ‚ÄúYou hurt me‚Äù ‚ÄúHow could you say you love me and entertain other girls?‚Äù and while I was sobbing he came up to me and hugged me, and I just let him until I finally pushed him away.\n\nI must‚Äôve said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI just wish I could be the only girl a guy has his eyes on‚Äù when he got upset with me and stormed out. I tried to follow him but I saw his group of friends outside looking at me and smiling. I ran the opposite direction, with many mixed feelings.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt even go in to school today. I feel so much disgust towards him, so much betrayal and anger. I‚Äôm hurt. I‚Äôve always been the one to cry in the relationship, and god knows why I gave his so many chances. He never made things right before, he never changed or kept any of his promises. Now he wants me back when he feels my absence? He doesn‚Äôt want me back because he loves me, he wants me back because nobody wants him! Not even the girl he cheated on me with. He has NO REMORSE.\n\nHow could he have the audacity to cheat on me with girls no where near my level? and tell me that ‚Äòhe was never attracted to them‚Äô nor ‚Äòwould he ever get with them‚Äô. I should have listened the first time people warned me he was cheating but I just looked past it.\n\nEverybody knows about the drama since our school is small. I know the people are on my side since nobody really likes him and he has a bad reputation- plus I can guess he‚Äôs laughing about he crying to all his friends. I cannot believe I gave his loser self a chance, and that I fell in love with him. \n\nTLDR: Me and my ex‚Äôs breaking up is creating conflict at school",

        "text": "I (17M) have become friends with a girl (17F) recently, let‚Äôs call her Ella. Even though I‚Äôve known her for about 3 years, we‚Äôve only recently begun to see each other more often. Our friendship is still in the beginning fase, so even though we both like each other (as far as I know), we do not hang out regularly (yet). We‚Äôre in the same class and yesterday something odd happened. It was a good day at first, during the English lesson that morning we talked and laughed a lot. So at the end of the day Ella asks me: ‚Äúdo we ride home together?‚Äù To which I respond something along the lines of ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôd like to‚Äù. (We both come to school on bicycles and live in relatively the same direction, coming from school). We were still talking with a couple friend we have in common when suddenly, she is acting cold to me followed by her asking a good friend (F18), let‚Äôs call her Anne, of hers if she would like to ride home together. Then they walk away and ride home without anyone else.\n\nThis being quite odd to me, I ask one of my friends (18M), let‚Äôs call him Levi, if he knows why she might have acted like that, to which he responds that I said something rude. Ok, sure, I couldn‚Äôt remember saying anything rude and he couldn‚Äôt tell me either.\n\nThe following day (today) after school (Ella rode away alone this time), I catch up to her and ask her: ‚Äúwhat was that all about yesterday?‚Äù She then responds with something along the lines of: ‚Äúwhen did we even talk yesterday?‚Äù  -  Now it might just be me, but isn‚Äôt it strange to forget you‚Äôve talked with someone a day ago, especially since it was quite long? On the other hand why would she pretend to have forgotten?  -  I explain the whole ‚Äòriding-to-home‚Äô thing I thought was weird to her, including what Levi had told me. She then responds saying ‚ÄúFirst of all, Levi is bullshitting, second of all I thought we were going to ride with the whole group and since Anne and you don‚Äôt go along too well (different story not really related I think), we just went‚Äù.  -  Isn‚Äôt that weird? Why even ask in the first place then?  -  She then follows up with ‚ÄúI think you might be feeling too insecure, too quick about things‚Äù  -  So it is my fault. Huh? I haven‚Äôt contacted her since this happened and vice versa.\n\nA similar situation happened only 3 weeks ago. Here she acted weird too, but after confronting her about it, she said other people (friends of us? me?) were lying and at fault back then.\n\nMaybe she‚Äôs right about me being feeling too insecure too quick about things, but idk the whole situation around her just feels weird. I still like her though, it is just not what I would have imagined from a friend.\n\nI‚Äôve thought about how this could be signs of manipulative behavior, but she is mostly nice in class. She doesn‚Äôt try to her get me to do things either. Maybe a big red flag however, is how she acts nice to her best friend face to face, yet talks shit about her behind her back. Even if this is a clear red flag I would still like to confront her or something. I still have the hopes for a good friendship. (Or should I just cut my losses?)\n\n\nTLDR:\nI (17M) have become friends with Ella (17F) recently. Ella asks me to ride home together then seemingly randomly leaves with another friend. When confronted, she denies having even talked that day and says it wasn‚Äôt her intention and others are twisting words. A similar situation happened only 3 weeks ago, it never seems to be her fault. Why would she act like this?",

        "text": "Now that I have your attention with a clearly controversial title, please read the entire thing before making any assumptions about what I mean by this, especially the last paragraph \n\nWhat do I do here? \n\nOk, so me m(18) and my gf (18) have been in a long distance relationship for just under 2 years and been going strong. We‚Äôve had our struggles here and there but overall we‚Äôve done pretty well. It‚Äôs important to note that one of these struggles is me struggling to give her the attention she needs because I‚Äôm usually on my laptop/Xbox when we call. And while I‚Äôve mostly phased that out and when we have quality time I get *off*all my devices, it‚Äôs still relevant information to have. \n\nRegardless, last night she was getting ready to go to bed and she showed me her legs. They were very hairy. Like, she had more hair than me. And sure, I‚Äôve never grown much hair, but I‚Äôm also a man who never shaved my arms or legs in my entire life(though I intend to shave most of it off soon), so that‚Äôs still saying something regardless. For other people this isn‚Äôt a big deal but body hair is a big turn off of mine, and when she showed me it just caught me off Guard. I also happened to be on my laptop since she was busy for a moment while she showered. So I just kind of shut down wondering if I should tell her about her legs or not. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her when she jokingly asked me ‚Äúdo you like my hairy legs‚Äù knowing the answer was a large no,  but I also didn‚Äôt want to tell her and make her insecure even though I really didn‚Äôt like it. And sure, she was clearly joking, but answering honestly would‚Äôve made her upset, and lying would‚Äôve bothered me. So I just‚Ä¶. Shut down. She seemed to take this as ‚Äúme being distracted on my laptop once again‚Äù which is a somewhat reasonable assumption, as my laptop was open and my behavior was similar to when I am distracted and not giving her attention, and now, even this morning, she is upset about it. and now I don‚Äôt know if I should just go with that, or tell her that it was about her legs which I really don‚Äôt want to do since it will make her insecure \n\nI need to clarify, if she wants to keep her body hair, (or if any woman wants to) you‚Äôre allowed to do that and I can‚Äôt stop you nor should I try. Your body your choice. But it definitely harms the attraction on my end which is something that‚Äôs actually important in a relationship \n\nTldr, gf showed me her leg hair, it was way more than I was expecting, and I froze wondering if I should tell her I didn‚Äôt like it or move the conversation elsewhere until she brought it back to her legs before I could move the topic, so I froze again. She took this as ‚Äúignoring her/not giving her attention‚Äù and now I‚Äôm sure how to handle this\n\nHow do I handle this?",

I don‚Äòt know if she has ever physically cheated, she denies it.\n\nWe talked about it and i decided to forgive her because i love her more than anything. \n\nI tried to get over it, but then started texting other girls because i felt like i had to ‚Äûrevenge‚Äú text someone else, but this never got to any explicit stages.

I thought about ending it here, but wanted to give it one more try.\n\nThe last thing that happened revolves around me. I was at a party last week with my co-workers and we all got really drunk. Later that night, I shared an Uber with my colleague (26F), because we needed to go to the same direction. In the Uber she kissed me, and I did not move away instantly, so we made out for a while until i realized what the hell i was doing. \n\nI told my gf the next day and said that i feel it‚Äòs best to break up, since we had both done wrong multiple times before, and that i don‚Äòt know if trying again would work long-term.

She wants to stay together, but I feel like breaking up, but I am not sure what‚Äôs best.",

        "text": "I‚Äôll preface this by saying this was kind of a messy situation. My boyfriend and I have been officially together for about 8 months now. Prior to that, we had been seeing each other on and off for about 10 months. We had an agreement that we could still see other people but to just be honest about it. Well, during this time, he had been seeing another woman on and off- we‚Äôll call her Ashley. He has since cut things off with Ashley and let her know that him and I are together, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to stop her. \n\n\nShe is constantly sending him texts in the middle of the night, talking about how much she misses him, wants to be with him, loves him, etc. she will send him memes on Instagram that say things like ‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm in your girlfriends nightmares‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish you‚Äôd just admit you‚Äôre in love with me‚Äù to which my boyfriend ignores..to my knowledge. \nOn top of that, I‚Äôve read in their texts that she regularly speaks badly about me, which he just ignores or asks her not to do, but she just keeps on doing Anyways. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs hard because my boyfriend would like to keep her as a friend/would like to be on good terms with her, but she just can‚Äôt seem to respect our relationship. I‚Äôve tried explaining to him that a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt do that, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. \n\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt help that while he was seeing the both of us casually, he would share with her in detail the issues we were having in our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, so she feels comfortable disrespecting me, regardless of him ignoring her. \n\n\nI‚Äôm really not sure what to do, it makes me extremely uncomfortable in many ways. Him wanting to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with someone who constantly disrespects his partner and his relationship, the constant flirting, everything. I‚Äôve asked him if she 100% knows that we are in a relationship and planning to move in together soon and he says yes, but refuses to block her or assertively tell her to leave him alone because he doesn‚Äôt want to be on bad terms with her. Any advice??\n\n\nTL;DR- my boyfriend‚Äôs ex won‚Äôt stop flirting with him and disrespecting me despite him telling her to stop or just ignoring her all together. Wondering what to do and if I‚Äôm in the wrong for wanting him to block her or tell her to leave him alone.",

The last night I ever saw him, was one of the scariest nights of my life. It‚Äôs disappointing and scary when the person that says that they are gonna protect you are the ones that you need protecting from. It all started when I was helping him clean his house. I was helping with dishes. As I‚Äôm listening to music with my AirPods in he comes over and pulls them out of my ear and stops the water and tells me to listen to the neighbors (mind you if the water was still on I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear anything). Sidenotes: he had this ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with his neighbors. He would constantly want to hear what they were saying, looking out his window when they were just simply having conversations and going into their homes and he would think that they were saying negative things about him.\n\n(Back to story) So I‚Äôm very confused and I go back to the dishes. When I‚Äôm done he starts getting mad and cursing at me OVER DISHES. I start to get on my phone and he takes it out of my hand and says ‚Äúyour phone privileges are taken away‚Äù WHAAATTT?!?!?! I told him that I didn‚Äôt deserve to treated like that and I tried to leave and he called me a b and said that if I left the neighbors would do something to me but I wasn‚Äôt buying it so I packed my things from his house all while. Then he said ‚ÄúI could kill you right now, it‚Äôs not a threat I‚Äôm just letting you know I could kill you right now‚Äù. I had never felt so unsafe in my life. I left his house and I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since. He of course sent paragraphs and apologies, but I just blocked. \n\nFebruary was a really good month for me, it was kind of like my January. I kept busy and hung out with people that appreciate me. I know it‚Äôs a process and I honestly think I‚Äôm coming on my period but this morning I was sitting in silence and started to think back to the situation and it made me sad all over again. But it wasn‚Äôt like the sadness I had around the time of the breakup. I didn‚Äôt really feel a heaviness, I think it was just something that I had to get out of my system. I‚Äôm so glad I got away from him when I did. I see so much change in my mind body and spirit. He was the definition of an abusive energy vampire. I‚Äôm in a much better place thank god. Thank you for listening I just had to get something‚Äôs off my chest üíï\n\n\nTl;dr: I cried this morning thinking about my ex and all he did while we were together such as calling me out my name. I‚Äôve since blocked him and I am in a much better place now.",

Before I start to clarify some things so This doesn‚Äôt turn into a mess of people letting me know how terrible I am. This is not about me cheating , I was wrong and I need to do better. This is about my brother and I . I‚Äôm not a serial cheater I‚Äôve cheated twice in the course of our 4 year relationship . That is not to say I deserve a medal like people kept insinuating but there is a difference between me and a person who cheats every weekend. \n\nRemember the conflict is about my brother going behind my back and telling my gf something I told him in confidence. Address that point, I‚Äôm not arguing about why I was wrong for cheating when I said I was. \n\nBack story \nSo long story short I cheated on my gf. Now keep in mind this wasn‚Äôt an affair or anything but my brother still felt the need to pull a D‚Äôangelo Russell . \n\nI met this girl on Snapchat and unfortunately I made a mistake. I told my brother and he told my gf, he didn‚Äôt warn me or anything.\n\n\nSo now I‚Äôm not speaking to him until he apologizes but he says he did nothing wrong even though our mother has said he should apologize but he refuses to do so. My mother is extremely upset at him and so is the rest of our family. However my co worker says that he wouldn‚Äôt have done that but he understands why my brother did. \n\nTL:DR My brother and I are currently in a stand off on who should apologize &amp; we not speaking to each other.\n\n\nEven if I do forgive him I won‚Äôt ever tell him something in confidence again",

        "text": "My bf and I have been together for a year.\n\nI won‚Äôt go into all the sappy love of my life/he‚Äôs the man I‚Äôm going to marry stuff because this sub hears it all the time. But he is very important to me and I would like to spend the rest of my life with him. This is the first issue we have had and I am looking for advice from anybody with experience or insight. We do not live together yet, and don‚Äôt plan to for a couple more years, though he stays at my place most nights for personal reasons.\n\nIt‚Äôs the typical story that I grew up pretty privileged, parents are still together and own their house, retired young etc. They also taught me financial literacy growing up and, because of that, I have some savings and good spending habits. I have my own apartment and cover all the bills.\n\nMy bf is on the other end of the spectrum, he has a single, disabled mom and no siblings. He grew up poor and has been on his own since 18, as a high school drop out. His mom ruined his credit and he had a 400 credit score at 18. He works his ass off, and his credit score is now 650, but has no savings or financial stability. \n\nI am in full time university, and only work part time. I have student loan debt, though it will be interest free and have enough savings to cover it. Regardless, to work down that debt, I have been pretty frugal the last few years. My bf works full time with the intention of going to trade school in the next 1-2 years.\n\nWhen we met, he had built up a small amount of credit card debt, as he had only been approved for a credit card that year and had no experience dealing with credit. A couple months into our relationship, he had to have a surgery which left him unable to walk, drive and work for 1-2 months, in which that debt accumulated to 8k. Once he was back on his feet, he picked up a second job and managed to pay that debt down to half in a couple of months. \n\nAfter seeing him work so hard to pay down the debt, I offered to pay off the remaining 4k with my student loans I had just received, with the promise from my bf that he would use this opportunity to build an emergency fund and savings, which would allow him to avoid further credit card debt in the future, build healthy habits, and pay me back fully before my student loans are owed. I did so because: I didn‚Äôt want to be tempted to spend the money and get myself into more debt, I don‚Äôt need the money and it would sit in my savings account regardless, and I thought having the credit card debt wiped would take a load off of his stress. Important note: when I paid off the cards, I took them. He has no ability to continue spending on them. This was at his request.\n\nIt‚Äôs been about two months since we paid off the credit cards and my boyfriend has been working 14 hour days, 5 days a week. I made it clear to him that my priority is him building savings, not paying me back, for the first couple of months.\n\nSkip ahead to yesterday, when he was picking up groceries. We split groceries, but he asked me to etransfer the full amount, and he would transfer me back his half today when he got paid. This is not a normal occurrence, so i asked him why. He said he had to send his mother money because she needed it and he had no money left.\n\nThis upset me, obviously. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt have any savings and why he sent his mother money if it would leave him with $0 to his name. His mother is an extremely sensitive topic for him, and is the source of a lot of childhood trauma. This subject led to a fight, our first fight in a year long relationship, in which he argued emotionally that I don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to have to support a parent, and I argued that he could‚Äôve said he spent his last $1 on cigarettes or video games and I would be just as upset. \n\nHowever, I know deep down that it is different than spending it on other stuff. And I know that I don‚Äôt and will never know what it‚Äôs like to have to take care of a parent financially, if anything, my parents still insist to help me where they can. \n\nLast night we addressed the conflict we had and both apologized for our oversights emotionally. We will be sitting down to discuss the money side of the issue tonight and I really need advice for how to deal with it. I am, deep down, angry at his mom for ruining his credit and continuing to prevent him from having financial stability for himself. I am also angry at him for not using these two months to create a savings, though his car did break down last month and cost a hefty amount to repair. Yes, we will be going through his bank records in detail tonight, which he has already agreed to. I know he is upset for disappointing me, and is struggling with his mental health a lot right now. He is my partner and I want to work through this in a healthy way, together, us against The Issue.\n\nThank you in advance. \n\n\ntldr; my boyfriend promised to build a savings with my financial help, but sent his mother money at his own expense. I don‚Äôt know how to handle this sensitive situation",

        "text": "I‚Äôm worried my BFs (32m) baby mama (29f) lied and the kid isn‚Äôt actually his\n\nSo backstory- we have been dating for about a year and recently decided to discuss marriage and it‚Äôs looking like we will be engaged soon. His daughter is an absolute delight and I adore her but I always noticed she didn‚Äôt look a thing like him. This isn‚Äôt an issue as some kids just don‚Äôt look like their parents, it happens; and I didn‚Äôt think much of it until recently when I felt an overwhelming urge to stalk his BM (29f) Facebook page; their daughter was born from a one night stand and the facts of that night have again not made sense in my mind. I hadn‚Äôt really bothered to go through her page as it wasn‚Äôt a prior relationship so I wasn‚Äôt very nervous or jealous or worried and hadn‚Äôt felt a need to check up on her or her past as our relationship isn‚Äôt strained etc. While doing this FB stalking I came across a few posts of hers from before she was pregnant (about one to two months before the date of conception) where she posted she had recently begun dating someone and included a name, my nosey self clicks the name and this guy is the spitting image of my boyfriends daughter. I was so shocked at the overwhelming similarities I showed my mother and a few trusted friends who reached the same conclusion as I, there is no way my boyfriends daughter is actually his. Not when there is a man who is her twin who dated the Baby-mama right up until the point of conception. I wish I could show photos because it‚Äôs not even a debate‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very apparent the other man is the father. The point of this story is I don‚Äôt know what to do. My boyfriends daughter is his entire world and I‚Äôm worried what finding out she isn‚Äôt his would do to him.. at the same time his baby mama has now switched to harassing him along with other issues. My first instinct is to say nothing but apart of me feels everyone maybe deserves to know the truth. I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do. Please help! Also his daughters feelings are most important‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm right a child would be finding out her dad isn‚Äôt actually her dad. I truly am at a loss\n\n\nTL:DR: My boyfriends daughter might not be his/ and his baby mama went out of her way to lie. What should I do",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been living with my parents until I move away in the summer for a job. My dog passed away on Friday.\n\nWe had him for 11 years, literally half of my life. I know every dog owner will say theirs was the best in the world, but mine really was. He was rescued from a dog fighting ring, covered in scars and had to get his leg amputated because he had been shot. When we first got him he was so scared and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone touch his ears or his face, went ballistic around other dogs and any item that looked like or sounded like a gun. But after years of working with him, he became so unbelievably sweet. He would climb into stranger‚Äôs laps and make friends at the dog park. His best friend was a chihuahua. He loved scratches on his face and belly even though he wouldn‚Äôt let us touch them before. He moved across the country with us and got me out of bed more times than I can count. \n\nHe was old and his quality of life was declining, so we had to put him to sleep. He was so brave the entire time. I held his head as he passed. Everyone in my family was heartbroken and my parents were crying so hard they couldn‚Äôt even speak at the vet, so I had to get all the paperwork and tell them he was ready for the shot. I had to tell my parents it wasn‚Äôt their fault he died and that he knew he was loved even though I had the same doubts about those things. \n\nIt‚Äôs only been four days and yesterday my parents came home with a new dog they rescued from the pound. No warning or anything, just brought her home. It‚Äôs way too early for me. The worst part is this dog is perfect, she‚Äôs so sweet and cuddly and is warming up to everyone fast. She‚Äôs cute and well behaved and wags every time I come up to her. \n\nI‚Äôm giving her lots of attention and love but I can‚Äôt feel anything but resentment that my parents couldn‚Äôt wait longer. I know that they were hurting too and need a dog to show some love but I hate seeing her in my dog‚Äôs bed, playing with his toys. I miss him so much I can‚Äôt stop crying. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to resent this dog when she did nothing wrong. How can I bond with her and avoid building resentment?\n\nTLDR: My dog of 11 years passed away and my parents immediately got a new dog, I need advice on how to bond with her.",

        "text": "I have been with my boyfriend since 2019. We were in long distance from 2020-2022 in different countries and didn't meet. We skyped and texted a lot. In late 2021, he had new flatmates one girl and a guy. The guy was anti vaccer and very threating. My boyfriend went through this trauma with her but left the apartment after few weeks of her moving in. She helped her move to his mother's place. At this point when we were in long distance he gave a lot of shit for asking for communication from him, texting more or calling more. He told me he's not a communicative person and doesn't like texting. Also he mentioned this girl as a flatmate not as a friend even. They did keep in touch called once over the year and met in Person once. Then he moved back to the same city as her to start his master's and they hung out a lot in the uni. She came over for dinners and they went on walk. At this time I was in same country but different cities (still ldr) we have had an issue with her as my boyfriend once or twice compared me to her and he didn't plan to visit me at all for three months because I lived far away but caught up with her in a nearby city. (While he was at his mother's place) when asked he described her as a loose friend. I was bothered by their frequent texting but it was still understandable. My boyfriend also told me he talks so much to him because she doesn't have much friends. Although I met her few days ago and she didn't even make eye contact with me talked directly to my boyfriend. When he left the room there was a stark silence. I initiated a conversation and she asked me about my experience in this new country and I shared my experience with racism and she dismissed it and basically started making a case for why what I think is wrong. She negated to everything I had to say and start a debate. She was not at all empathic to my lived experiences. And when my boyfriend left the room she would tell me what she thinks he'll like. And if I said I had X problem with him she'll be like I know. She didn't leave a moment to tell me how close she's with him and if she would disagree with me she would look at my boyfriend as if they're talking with eyes. So after this I confronted my boyfriend that she doesn't seem like a loose friend and how does she knows about your love language and tells me she knows things I don't think you'll share. He said he doesn't remember maybe he did mention it. But she's not a close friend despite the fact she's not from his department and they hangout with each other the most. This got me suspicious and I demanded to go through their text and from Oct21-Dec21 they've talked literally everyday. At start about the common trauma and problem with the flatmate but then the conversations is in paragraphs and mundane like what are you doing? Or sending pictures of what they cooked? She send a bathroom selfie of her in a new haircut. And then the frequency dropped to thrice a week then after March once or twice a month. But my boyfriend told her when he got an internship that very day shared what he wants to dress like at the workplace even consulted her on buying a gift for me. To note this was a time he gave me shit for asking for more communication and said he's not a Texter while he texted with her in paragraphs for months straight. While describing this as a loose friendship. He doesn't talk to any of her other friends like this. What alarms me is the fact that I was in the lie of what kind of relationship he has with this girl and that I put a lot in line to move to this country to be with him. And he told me they're loose friend and when I met her she treated me awfully and implied how close she's with him. They have a great rapport and it also worries me how can he be friends with someone so insensitive and attacking. \n\nOn one hand I feel he has crossed the boundaries and texting with a female friend you met a month ago continuously everyday even after leaving the apartment having a long distance friendship and not even telling me that she's a friend is just wrong and alarming. On the other hand I want to believe him that they're just friend, he talks with her a lot but they're not intimate.\n\nTL;dr He did suggest to minimise contact with her and go to couples therapy. I just am shattered I feel my trust is broken and honestly I feel I have been lied to. Am I overreacting? Is it okay to text a female friend you just met for day and night for few months straight when you're not even in a city? Is it okay for a friend to attack and act awfully with the partner of their friend of an year? I would really appreciate your advice.",

They're understandably frustrated because they feel that they're taking on more of the household work as well as being more stressed in general. My other housemate has fairly severe depression and we're both diagnosed ADHD. I've tried to be good about keeping common spaces tidy, but my NB housemate explained that they've been doing smaller tasks that I hadn't thought about (wiping down counters, cleaning mirrors). They've also been more on top of paying attention to when trash day is. Does anyone have any ideas (aside from just my housemate and I getting better about this) to help balance the workload fairly? I've just picked up a chore chart and plan on using it. I am trying, but I'm just not as disciplined and I don't really 'notice' when things need to be done as quickly as they do. My parents didn't provide a lot of structure or discipline as a child so I was rarely expected to clean, and my ex-partner and I made enough money that we had a weekly maid. I do want to help my housemate and be better about this. I've considered offering to pay more rent so that my NB housemate pays less, but I feel like it's weird to essentially be 'paying' them to clean more, and sets up a strange expectation. We live in a fairly large house and it would be a lot for me to pay for an actual maid to clean the entire place. I could shop around for someone who would just do common areas? \n\ntldr: Looking for creative ideas for how to help balance household duties when one person is more naturally tidy, and also more stressed in general.",

        "text": "\n(21 male) very complicated situation here and a long one but bear with me please, i've been a lurker on this reddit for a few months now on a different account and i feel like i can get relevant advice here. \n\nso i suspect my father may be cheating on my mom, or he already has cheated on her, i dont know what to think to be honest.\n\ni first came to discover certain findings a couple months ago. i was logged into my fathers gmail to try and find an old email that contained information that i needed, one thing lead to another and i ended up looking through his google drive, and thats where i came across a few things. a few things to know first, my father enrolled into university about 3 years ago to attain a degree and he quickly settled into a friendship group, he pretty much stayed with this group for the entire 3 years. from what i know, the group contains about 3 guys and about 3 women. i would like to now go through the set of pictures i found. first set of pictures i found were fairly normal group type photos in different locations, i cant pinpoint where, but in some of them he has his arm around one of the 3 women. this first set of pictures made me question things but it didnt freak me out. i came across a photo where he seems to be in someones house and the photo is of a woman who looks like she just came out the shower and all she has is a towel wrapped around her body, theres no evidence to suggest he took the picture or that hes there but this picture is in his google drive nonetheless. this woman doesnt seem to be part of the friendship group as i dont see her anywhere else bar this. another picture i found was him having his arm around this 1 woman from the group again but in a much more intimate way, they seem to be hugging. this 1 woman appears alot later. now the set of videos i found is where things became very alarming and freaked me out a little bit. in a video he is seen getting down on one knee presenting a bouque of flowers to this 1 woman who seems to have children of her own, but no idea if she is married or not atm. i cant make out what hes saying but its a bunch of stuff. another group of videos i find is him and the group at a park, one video is all of them racing and one video he has his shirt off, only wearing a vest and him and this one woman are walking off into the distance with their arms around eachother. his friend is also doing the same thing with the other woman in the group, i know for a fact he has kids but no idea if hes in a marriage atm. another set of videos i find is all of them at one of their houses, there is music playing in the background and everyone is dancing, he also starts dancing with this same 1 woman again, holding her hand and just sort of bobbing up and down, about 3 videos is just this. one very alarming video i found was all of them in what seems to be a 10 seater van going somewhere, this 1 woman is seen grinding on the lap of the other woman and the other woman begins to spank her \"pardon my language\", to which my father and the other guy begin shouting \"do it again\" \"harder, harder\". theres 1 video of them going to our house at night whilst we werent there, me, my mother and my sister were out the country for a few weeks, the video shows them turning up late at night and surprising him and thats it. this is the the main contents of his google drive\n\nonto his google search history which he has now deleted, but god is my witness to what i saw. me my mother and sister have been living in another country for a couple months now for study purposes, we have large extended family here. my father has stayed back in the UK for work but we regularly visit eachother, he recently made a series of trips to turkey to find and finalise the purchase of a holiday home in instanbul. in the midst of those trips i accessed his google search history (if someone has web history turned on, you can view it from any device anywhere just by logging into their account\". his search history contained multiple searches enquiring about prostitutes near where he was staying, and very intimate message parlours. he has since deleted all this (maybe he is on to me) but as i said, god is my witness to what i saw, i have no idea if he actually met up with any or went to any of the parlours, but the searches were there. whether he has physically cheated on my mom i dont know, emotionally at the very least? Yes.\n\nnow onto where i currently stand. to put it simple, i dont have the guts to confront him nor go to my mother about this. it hasnt weighed on me much yet as i have very convincingly managed to convince myself that this is not my business. other reason why i havent done anything is because the one thing that terrifies me the most is breaking this family apart, my sister and my father are very close but me and my sister are not and i know she'd blame me. my mother has also been through so much in her life, i cant bare to imagine what this will do to her. we have a fantastic support system here as we have alot of extended family who are all very close, we all dearly love eachother, i'm very specifically very close with my aunt, shes done so much for me and i have told myself that if i do ever decide to do anything about this, she is the first person i would go to, but i just cant do anything about this. in terms of evidence i have the google drive, but the google searches are all gone now. also worth mentioning i have found porn on his laptop a couple times.\n\nI also came across a recording of a call with a woman from Pakistan, they're speaking in urdu. I don't catch much of the call at all but I do catch a part where he apologises to her for being scared and running away when he got married to my mom, to which she replies its all okay.\n\nas i said, this isnt weighing on me much yet (at the beginning it did) but this has defo changed the way i view my father. i love him as a father and everything hes done for me (he really has, early years of my childhood we were broke and he gave everything he ever had for us), but i do not look up to him anymore, no way. im also concerned that once i get married, will this haunt me, i have no idea. i posted about this months ago in a random sub too and i deleted very quickly, but 1 advice i got was to see a therapist to ease my mind. that is not possible, atleast not whilst im abroad, im here for the next 5 months. i would have to do it secretly and here, everyone would find out, plus im very unfamiliar with this country. maybe when im in the UK but chanced of that will also be very slim.\n\ni dont know if what i am doing is correct, but i dont have the guts to bring all this to light, i cant break this family apart and i cant bare to watch the suffering my mother will go through, that weighs on me significantly more than just keeping this in.\n\n\"EDIT: for context, we are a Muslim family. Mother is religious, father not so much.\n\nsorry for the long post, just coming here for advice because I know many of you are probably old enough to be my parents\n\nTLDR: my father may be cheating on my mom, I have discovered multiple evidences of him engaging inappropriately with other women and googling prostitutes.",

        "text": " \n\nOk so this is kind of an update from [my question 3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z7vgob/my_22m_relationship_with_my_21f_female_friend_is/). TLDR of that post is that we had gotten very close with my female friend, talking everyday, travelling alone, seeing her almost everyday and some not so 'friend' things, massaging, cuddling, kissing and one time having sex.\n\nNow after almost 8 months of this we finally sat down and talked about our relationship because the last month we have come even closer to each other and i kinda made a move on her and she refused. The main problem being that she is trying to be in a relationship with another guy she started dating after me (but is a family friend and has known since childhood), but he lives in another town and only sees him once a month.\n\nWhat she said is basically this, that she has feelings for me and sees me romantically but really wants to try the relationship with this guy since she valued him for a long time. It has been hard for her to have feelings for me while in this long distance relationship and admits that I filled a lot of roles of holes left by the distance, I was there for her in her hardest times. But she don't want to hold me back and keep me as a second option if her relationship doesn't work. She also regrets not trying taking things to the next level with me some months ago when we had sex, but she was afraid of losing me as a friend if things did not work out.\n\nI admitted my feelings too, she cried and did not talk to me, but the question of what we are going to do now is the only thing she said. Obviously I since she seemed committed to him I said I would love to try a relationship with you but since we can't, we will have to keep some distance for a while. She cried even more and now a week has passed and we haven't spoken.\n\nI am really at a loss. I have lost my best friend, the person I was doing everything with for almost a year. The worst thing is that now that she admitted we had a chance it makes me question myself, if only we had done something different, if she can't take the long distance maybe she will think about it again... all that really fucks up with my head and I am unsure if I should give up on her forever, maybe wait and talk to her again, still be her friend... I really love her and I know she loves me too but we both made some bad choices and the timings was all wrong.\n\nDo you think there is a chance between us in the future? I know she will not last too long on this relationship because she wants someone there for her, but I don't want to sit and wait for her. Can we stay friend after this month or two of not talking? I am not sure how I can keep her in my life without holding me back..\n\nTL;DR: My friend is in a long distance relationship now that she is not sure about but we both admitted to have feelings for each other. Not sure if we should cut of completely, try again when the time is right or just stay friends.",

Long story short, I blacked out and don‚Äôt remember half the night. \n\nI woke up the next morning and was told of the horrendous things I did.\n I said things like ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt love me‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet away from me‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo one cares about me‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never understand‚Äù. I was also rude to one of her friends. My gf said when she brought me home, I was man handling her and swinging her around in the road. When she got me inside, she tried to help me undress. And at the time, I was unconscious swinging my head around and accidentally collided heads with her. \n\nI‚Äôve never been blackout drunk or ever acted in this manner. When I‚Äôve been drunk in the past, I am always extremely lovey dovey. It sounded like a completely different person and it honestly scares me. I learned a lesson and will no longer be touching alcohol.\n\nI am not saying I am in the right what so ever, It just feels like i woke up with no memory and now my whole world is upside down. My girlfriend now wants to take a break/needs distance because she cannot look at me. \n\nI know I fucked up, and will be learning from this experience. I just feel lost because we have been together for 4 years and never had anything go wrong really. We‚Äôve never fought and I felt she was the one. Now it feels like I‚Äôve thrown it all away in one night.\n\nI know saying sorry doesn‚Äôt change anything, I‚Äôve tried my best to apologize and dont know how I can make mends. \n\nTDLR: Got too drunk and lost gf.",

He‚Äôs thinks the exact opposite and that makes confrontation inevitable.\n\nLately I‚Äôve been encountering situations with him where he‚Äôs overly aggressive with me. He makes comments like ‚ÄúYou should know that by know‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already explained you‚Äù in new topics that I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt seen because this is my first job related to the career I studied.

Any advice?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is also my boss, and he‚Äôs treating me like trash in the work aspect. I suspect that‚Äôs if someone suspects we‚Äôre dating, they can‚Äôt say that he‚Äôs giving me some ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù. ?",

At first I said I'd go, but now I don't want to for three main reasons:\n\n1) The last time I went on a family vacation (last July), my dad treated me like a kid, like he always has, and it really soured it for me. I accidentally broke a glass and he pushed me out the way to clean it up himself and lecture me while doing it. He backseat drove while I was driving. Other annoying things. I'm not up for putting myself through that again.\n\n2) My parents have moved into paranoia territory regarding masking up. I had to kill my social life to an absolute 0 while living with them, and obsessively double-mask/glove-up/avoid people, so I don't know how they're so comfortable doing an international trip now, but either way, they plan on eating food in the airplane bathroom so they don't have to unmask around passengers (I'm serious) and only getting takeout and shuffling away back to the hotel room to eat. Not how I want to experience Japan.\n\n3) I'd rather save up my PTO for another solo travel trip.\n\nI didn't tell them 1 and 2, only 3, but they still took it pretty hard and feel like I should join them. \n\nTL;DR Don't want to travel with my parents and don't know how to tell them.",

        "text": "TL;DR - Partner is starting burlesque, I have mixed emotions, but want to be supportive for her.\n\nFirst of all, I know I need to sit down and communicate my feelings with her.  It's on my list for this weekend. This is more to gather an outside opinion and arrange my thoughts.\n\nMy partner and I have been together for nine years now.  I love her more than anything else.  It all started when we went to a burlesque show on Valentine's Day this year.  It was fun and we both had a great time.  She mentioned in passing that she'd like to take a class and perform sometime.  I didn't think much of it, and said \"knock yourself out!\" Fast forward to last night, and she told me she signed up for the classes and the show will be on her birthday.\n\nAt first I was excited that she found a new hobby, as she doesn't have many, or they go by the wayside.  I'm absolutely thrilled that she's taking the initiative to make new friends, (we moved to a new town about 3 years ago) bolster her confidence, and see herself as the gorgeous jaw dropping woman I see her as.  All was good and well, and we went to sleep.\n\nThis morning I started work, and had some time to think.  While I find the IDEA of her getting on a stage and engaging in suggestive and risque behavior to be very sexy, now that it's going to happen, I'm a little uncomfortable.  Probably like a 5-6/10 on a scale.\n\nI know that she enjoys the drama, comedy, acting, and performance more than the sensuous bits, and I think she'll have a great time doing it.  I keep having flashbacks to the performance, something I haven't thought of since the evening we went.  While there was no nudity and it was mostly fun, some of the women left very little to the imagination.  Think pasties and g-strings.\n\nI want to be supportive of her new hobby, but at the same time it's starting to make me feel sick to my stomach.  I'm a very average looking guy, and get little to no attention from women, or I might be completely oblivious.  I'm afraid that having a room full of people hooting and hollering for her will exasperate some pretty ugly jealousy and self confidence issues from myself.  I've been working on that, amongst other things, in therapy.\n\nI trust her completely, so I'm not worried about infidelity.  I know that it's her choice and her body.  I would never keep her from an open door.  I'm worried it might have an effect on my feelings of physical desirability towards her.  As fucked up as it is, somehow less \"special\" for me.\n\nI'm not going to run into our talk slapping an ultimatum on the table.  We'll sit down and discuss how we feel about everything.  We've weathered worse, and being open minded and willing to compromise when needed is something we've always done for each other.\n\nI guess in the end, my question is, do you fine folks feel like it would be too possessive, controlling, or selfish to bring up the idea of her comforting me after the show?  Or maybe doing the show with something more than dental floss and electrical tape?  There were a few performers that did their acts less scantily clad and were great.  Maybe that was her intention all along, making this whole thread moot?\n\nThis is by no means a deal breaker, I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this as a kind, supportive partner, but also taking my feelings into consideration. I want both of us to be happy with the outcome.  It will be a challenge, and I don't expect to have a resolution from a single conversation.",

I know relationships are full of good and bad moments and the bad moments make it stronger, but I feel so guilty and I truly still want her to talk about it with me since altho I wasn't showing it alot i genuinely liked listening to it.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I wait, is she gonna talk about it with me in the future or am I being completely denied from this because of my mistake....\n\ntl;dr - girlfriend stop talking about something she really liked because I showed my Insecurity and I don't want her to stop , don't know what to do plz help",

        "text": "Hi! So, I (23f) have been with my bf (27) for about 5 years now and we are quite happy. But there is this thing that makes me insecure about our relationship sometimes, which is that I occasionally get intense feelings of sorts for other people I meet. \n\nI'm the type to get into intense friendships, where I vibe with someone so much upon first meeting that we are inseparable for a while and talk ALL the time, wanting to know everything about each other, before transitioning into a more normal friendship (or, in some cases, become best friends forever, and in other cases, they tell me they like me so I end it). Idk if it's romantic or platonic, it's just this intense attraction to each other, like a crazy crush- and it's super different from how my boyfriend and I are. We love each other in a gentle way and I know it will last, but it was never obsessive or an insane attraction or anything like that. I know he will love me forever, but he has been my only serious relationship and I have never been able to explore my own romantic/sexual/platonic feelings in different settings, so I often get confused about these things. I've never cheated and I never will, I never flirt with other people and the few times where I realized that the other party was romantically/sexually interested in me I drew clear boundaries and stopped talking to them, so I feel like I'm being responsible about it. But I'm so fricking confused and kinda feel guilty for even experiencing strong feelings for other people. I don't even really know how to describe what it is and am unsure how to discuss this with my bf, if I should.\n\nIs this normal?? Are they crushes, or am I just a weirdo with friendships? Any input is welcome lmao.  \n\n\nTLDR: I get strong feelings for new friends at times and don't know if these are romantic crushes that could threaten my relationship, or just normal friendship feelings.",

        "text": " \n\nTL;DR: My 36yo Indian husband got completely put off sex the day he married me and I can't understand why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 36F Indian married to my partner 36M for the last 6 years now. We met through one of the dating apps, had the hots for each other initially, fell in love, and then got married by eloping after 2 years.\n\nWe used to have a lot of sex before we got married. Not just sex, but there was a lot of emotional and non-sexual intimacy too. We got married, I moved it and it was like a switch that went off. There was a steep decline in the kind of sexual experiences and time that we were sharing with each other to a point that we used to go 5-7 weeks without getting intimate. Since the day we got married, we‚Äôve mostly had sex only when I have initiated it. If I leave it to him, we go months without getting intimate. I‚Äôve pointed this out to him and he just gives me a hard time about playing this game where I am not initiating.\n\nBut I still don‚Äôt get any effort from him. These days, if once in a few things start to heat up, he is only concerned about getting off himself and doesn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about my pleasure. It has become torturous having sex with him now and my body wants to repel him to such a level that I just give him a handy so that he gets off and I don‚Äôt need to have sex with him because it doesn‚Äôt feel great to have to beg him to get intimate with me or meet the tiniest of my sexual needs.\n\nWe‚Äôve had a lot of conflict in our marriage to date because of my in-laws not being on board with our marriage. It‚Äôs been 5 years and I don‚Äôt have any contact with them and neither do any of them. Whenever my husband returns from a visit to his family he is horribly toxic and bitter toward me. I am aware of the kind of words that are used by his family to influence him against me, so it doesn‚Äôt really come as a shock now. But it still does hurt.\n\n2 years ago he‚Äôd returned home after visiting his family and things got really bad and heated up. Things escalated to such a level that he tackled me to the floor and even hurt himself. I knew I had to get out of the house and marriage then and there. But for some reason I still can‚Äôt understand, I didn‚Äôt. After a lot of individual and couple counseling, I realized that he doesn‚Äôt see any issue with our lives together or our sex life. He isn‚Äôt concerned or interested in working on it let alone meeting my needs or making me feel fulfilled in the marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, he is lying around, sneaking out on dates, flirting, and sexting with women, all of it.\n\nWhat I am struggling with over here is that I don‚Äôt understand why I haven‚Äôt walked out yet when clearly this relationship isn‚Äôt meeting any needs of mine.\n\nI have tried everything from talking, couples therapy, spicing up things, and more to make him feel interested in me or feel interested in having sex with me. But he doesn‚Äôt seem interested at all. I don‚Äôt know what happened where.\n\nWe moved to a different country a year ago, one that‚Äôs a lot more accepting, liberal, and open. I was hoping that maybe he would discover himself here and in return bring us closer to each other. I was really wrong.\n\nI would appreciate any inputs you have about either how to deal with this or just help me understand the situation so that I could change the way I am dealing with it.",

        "text": "Throw away account.\n\nMy wife (32F) and I(35M) have been together since early high school, we went to the same college and got married shortly after we graduated.  We spent the next 10 years of our marriage travelling the world and enjoying being married.  It was never perfect, but didn't have many big issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince our child was born early in the pandemic a lot has shifted in our dynamic and marriage.  We both work from home now and we split the household chores as close to 50/50 as possible.  Same goes for caring for our child.  As it should be in my opinion for 2 working adults.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever it seems that our relationship has suffered and gotten much worse since the birth of our child.  Intimacy has been a huge issue that we can't seem to come to an agreement on.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started seeing a marriage counselor back in December when we had a pretty bad fight about the lack of sex and general emotional connection.  We've had arguments around this topic since the birth of our son.  Our consoler has given us a ton of good suggestions that we've failed to implement.  IE: Daily check in's, Daily non sexual intimacy, not defaulting to watching TV when our son goes to bed.. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer love language is Acts of service.  I make an effort to take the kiddo out each week and give her at least 1 hour of \"her time\".  Normally we just go to the grocery store, pick up some stuff we need and i get her flowers that my child picks out for her.  I also make an effort to do any household chores before being asked to lighten the mental load.  IE laundry, cooking, groceries, yard work, trash, general cleaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest issues is the only time we have sex is in the mornings after she has a \"sex dream\".  Which is about every 2ish weeks.  I would prefer sex 1-2x per week.  I've brought this up as an issue by telling her that we need to make an effort to feel more connected and asked what i can do to \"warm the oven\" more so that we can get to the point of at least 1x per week.   I was told to be more confident and assertive when I initiate. So I attempted to initiate with confident but was rejected each time.   Our marriage counselor had suggested, have you tried scheduling it? She said that is an Absolute no from her.   Our counselor suggested a few other things that were a hard no for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other issue i have is that she doesn't verbalize any affirmations to me.  I have asked her several times to say, can you please just tell me that you love me, or that you appreciate me, or your proud of me from time to time?  She will sometimes just say \"thank you\" when i say love you, she doesn't kiss me goodnight or even tell me goodnight sometimes.  Same with when we go to our separate area's of the house when we go to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue that keeps bubbling to the surface is that i play video games with my friends twice a week at night after my child goes to bed.  My partner HATES  this.  She has brought it up multiple times that this is an issue for her.  I told her that she should either play with me or pick up a hobby she can do while i do that. I told her this is my self care and time with my friends that's very important to me.  She doesn't seem to understand and brings this up every time we get in an argument about intimacy or connection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest thing i struggle with and am seeing an individual counselor is a depressive spiral when my needs are not being met by my partner.  I start to get in my own head and think \"am i a bad husband?\" \"am i not worthy of love?\" \"what is so wrong with me my own wife won't tell me she loves me or have sex with me?\".  I understand that's not healthy and have been working on ways to better combat that spiral.  I'm not there yet, but I'm making progress, but it's been difficult.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently we've gone 2 weeks with no sex or sexual intimacy.  I also realized in that span she hasn't told me she loves me or even kissed me.  I started to spiral and identified the spiral and tried to communicate \"Hey I'm not feeling great about myself, I feel like we haven't been intimate and you really haven't told me you loved me or kissed me in the past few weeks. \"  This caused a blow up argument that has to be the worst we've had since we got married.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me that she can't keep reassuring me that our marriage is okay, that I need to fix the spiral and be okay with not being intimate for long periods of time because our lives have changed and my expectations are not realistic.  She said that she can't keep worrying that is she doesn't have sex with me or do sexual things.  She also said \"I'm sorry I don't keep a fucking note pad on how many times i kiss you or tell you i love you\"  Nothing will ever be enough for you.  It ended with me crying on the floor and apologizing and telling her i's sorry, I'm going to keep working on myself.  She said sorry isn't cutting it anymore and she expects results and then she brought up putting me on anti depressants.   We didn't really speak for 2 days after that argument.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel ashamed and guilty about brining up these issues and not being able to advocate for myself with out apologizing and ending up as the one who promises to change.  I feel like i live in a world of \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not looking for sympathy or to be roasted.  I'm looking for general advice on how to proceed with this because i don't want to be divorced or live in a house where i don't feel loved or appreciated.  I understand i have issues and may be at fault here.   However I'm not sure on how to proceed, I'm open to feedback on things i can do better.  I'm not perfect and really want advice on things i could be doing wrong or coping mechanisms. \n\nTLDR: Wife and I are having constant fights about intimacy and affirmations after our child was born",

Afterwards, I told my gf I‚Äôd take her to a store to get her a new picture frame and stuff for a fancy dinner she wanted. We just chatted and hung out. I pretended to propose to her with my AirPods. While in the store I asked her if she wanted to hangout with me tomorrow, and she said she couldn‚Äôt because she was seeing a friend. I then said I couldn‚Äôt hangout on Thursday because I‚Äôm proctoring a night exam and I can‚Äôt hangout on Friday because I told a friend I was going to watch idiocracy at his house.\n\nIt then felt like she got mad at me and she said ‚Äúoh so I‚Äôm not going to see you at all this week‚Äù. Then she proceeded to give me one word responses for the the rest of the night. \n\nI got home to her place and she goes to the bathroom and slams the door and starts taking a shower. I make dinner alone in the kitchen and I cry a little. After I give her the food we see an episode of tv. She stays silent. I continue to ask her what‚Äôs going on and she just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù.\n\nI then take a shower and come to bed. I ask her again what‚Äôs wrong and that we should talk about it. She says she‚Äôs just going to go to sleep. I then go to sleep and she wakes me up like 30 minutes later and starts crying! She says ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you love me?‚Äù. I told her that I did and being with her is my highest priority. She then said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give examples of things you do for me or all the time we spend together because it makes me feel like you just do those things to manipulate me into feeling guilty‚Äù. I tell her I won‚Äôt. I say that she‚Äôs all that I look forward to throughout my day and that being with her makes me happy. I asked ‚Äúwhat is making you feel unloved‚Äù and she said ‚Äúit seems like you don‚Äôt want to be here and you‚Äôre just doing everything out of obligation‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt get that because I see her everyday because I want to. I make her dinner every night because I want to. I get her little gifts and do little things to help around the house because I want to. Like that seems like a lot to do just because of obligation. I didn‚Äôt say any of that to her because I didn‚Äôt want her to feel like I was manipulating her or trying to hold the stuff we do over her head. So instead I just said ‚Äúnothing makes my day better than you and you‚Äôre all that I want‚Äù and she just said ‚Äúwhatever I‚Äôm going to bed‚Äù\n\nIn the morning she apologized for being dramatic and I left for work. I gave her a kiss and told her to have a good day. This has been happening more and more at random times. She blows up out of nowhere and then gets really sad. Then I comfort her and it goes back to normal. I asked her if she‚Äôs considered therapy but she says ‚Äúwtf do you think I‚Äôm crazy why would you suggest that‚Äù\n\nI really don‚Äôt understand what I should be doing differently. I‚Äôm a first year grad student and I am doing research and taking classes and teaching class but I still spend almost all my free time with her.

        "text": "Throwaway account.\n\nMy partner and I had been together 1 year 2 months. I moved in back in November to his place. \n\nThis is his first adult serious relationship, he‚Äôs dated in the past but it was in college a different period of his life. \n\nEverything was great until last fall. \nWe never fought, we got alone seamlessly, we shared a ton of cool outdoor hobbies together, we have similar values and views on money etc. he‚Äôs incredibly kind and gets along with my friends and vise Versa. I love his family and they love me as well. Nothing at all to complain about between us. Everything generally flows so easily with him and I. I‚Äôve dated a lot and he‚Äôs the first one everything felt so right with. \n\nA week after I moved I asked if everything was okay because he had been very stressed buying a house the past few months. Out of nowhere he said we are not compatible and that he didn‚Äôt see himself with me and that I‚Äôm selfish and he saw us as just being good friends. We took the night apart and talked in the morning and he was crying apologizing for taking his stress out on me. I was shocked and still hurt but didn‚Äôt end it because I had just moved my entire life in a week ago. \n\nEverything was fine for a while until after new years, I was a little bummed that I didn‚Äôt end up spending it with my friends. I compromised and let him host his out of state friends and then we‚Äôd go to my friends place after midnight. One night I asked if all was well and yet again he said we were not compatible with how we spent our time. he thought I needed a huge party on NYE &amp; he likes a more chill NYE and maybe we should break up. That was not the case on my end, I was just sad I didn‚Äôt get to spend it with my friends. The next morning he regretted saying that again.\n\nLast week this happened yet again and we made it official, he broke up with me and said I‚Äôm not the girl he can date, he needs someone more low-key and he could see us being very very good friends. \n\nWe live together and I was shocked and confused so we sat down and had a lot of discussions.\n\nHe said I‚Äôm the perfect partner and he has no complaints about me. He was trying so so hard to desperately make this work because he loved me but didn‚Äôt see it as a sustainable way to live for him.\n\nBut after talking we came to the conclusion that he could not keep up with the amount of activities I wanted to do each week and had been stretching himself way to thin and was stressed and overwhelmed which led to him starting to resent me. He had been trying to be the perfect partner for me and meet all my needs while neglecting his own. Which is why it seemed perfect for me. \n\nWe came to the conclusion that he was not communicating his needs to me for time alone and for rest and would not say no to me if he didn‚Äôt want to do something and that let to his resentment. he also thought he was not good enough for me when I would kindly ask for a little more affection etc. I‚Äôm good at communicating my feelings and needs to him but he is not. I said all of this could have been fixed with a discussion, and we could have made better life balance for him. A lot of these issues he agreed could be fixed if he had a WFH job like me. His job can take a lot of time and energy from him. But he never voiced that he needed more downtime.\n\nAfter breaking up a week ago he started meeting his own needs and I never asked him to go do things. Since then everything has been working seamlessly and he claims the resentment he was feeling towards me is gone. And he‚Äôs finally seeing all the good in me. Since he realized he‚Äôs not responsible for all my happiness. we still get along great and have been having fun enjoying each others company and taking more space from each other to do our own thing (which we didn‚Äôt before)  he said the past week has been perfect and now he‚Äôs super confused and regrets the break up. \n\nHe‚Äôd like to start the relationship again and is scared to loose me, he said he can‚Äôt be 100% certain and make any solid promises that I‚Äôm right for him as the past week has been incredible but also an emotionally stressful time for us. But he thinks it can work out. \n\nHe‚Äôs going to start therapy to work on these internal issues and learning how to not be such a people pleaser at the sacrifice of his own needs. \n\nI already rented a new place and will be moving next week, I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for both me and him right now.\n\nI love him so so deeply and sometimes this doesn‚Äôt seem to be a big problem to me and could have been fixed with communication but sometimes it seems like a massive issue. We work so well besides this thing and that seems to be resolved in his head? If he had just spoke up I would have gladly worked with him to make sure he wasn‚Äôt feeling this way. I‚Äôm just trying to protect myself and my time. \n\nShould I ever get back with this guy? Can he be trusted not to do this again? \n\nTL;DR \n\nMy partner is a huge people pleaser and was stretching himself so thin to make me happy and meet all my needs he was neglecting his own this let to resentment towards me and he ended the relationship. Thinking we were not compatible.\n\nOnce he started meeting his own needs and we took time in the week to ourselves the relationship on both ends was working incredibly well. We have been getting along great and missing each other and everything seems so normal again. He regrets the break up and wants to try again, but I don‚Äôt know if I should.",
