I am a Taiwanese who is going to study in USA ,and before I depart ,I still have some grammar questions.\n\nI learned conditional grammar a few years ago, finding it not a difficult grammar for me. But ! Yesterday when I was reviewing all common use grammar,  I found myself not actually understanding how to use it correctly.... \n\nConditional grammar has four parts, which I all but understand except for \"second conditional\" and \"third conditional\".\n\nSecond conditional is used in following way:\n\nSimple past + would /should.... +verb\n\n\nThird conditional is used in following way:\n\nPast perfect + would /should...have + past participle \n\n\n\n\nThe point I don't understand is that if I am going to say, for example, \"I haven't finished my homework, but if I did I could hang out with my friends.\", Is using \"had finished \" correct ?\n\nBecause it seems second conditional overlaps third conditional.\n\nIf I use present perfect in second conditional, it will become past perfect, doesn't which misconstrue listeners or audiences? \n\n\nFor example:\n\nSituation : I haven't finished my homework, when my friend asks me to hang out. \n\nSecond conditional :If I had finished my homework, I could hangout with you. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSituation : I hadn't finished my homework, when my friend asked me to hang out .\n\nThird conditional :If I had finished my homework, I could have hung out with you. \n\n\n\nBoth conditionals are used \"had finished\" . Is this incorrect?  Or native speakers can understand which conditional I am using depending on a situation ?\n\nAnd! \n\n\"Differentiation would have occurred easily if Earth were molten when it was young.\"\n\nWhy is \"were molten\" correct ?\nShouldn't it be \"had been molten\" ?\n\nI think it happened in the past, so the writer should use \"had been molten\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Did someone insist that restorative approaches were utilised (at some previous time)? Or was it insisted that restorative approaches should be utilised (in the future)? The latter is certainly the intended meaning.\n\nSo have I done the right thing?
