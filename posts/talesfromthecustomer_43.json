        "text": "I stopped at a tea shop to stock up on my favorite tea. I was greeted right away by someone and told him what I wanted. He seemed new because he was having trouble finding the right tin of tea, and was a little awkward but nice. He had a cast on one wrist and had a lot of trouble opening the tin (which was large, like 12 inches in diameter). He asked his co-worker for help who was at the counter next to him, helping someone else. She kind of berated him and was like \"are you jimmying it back and forth?\" which he clearly was, finally she sighs a big sigh and helps him. She had a fair amount of trouble too, with no cast on, so clearly the tin was tightly closed. \n\nShe just continued to berate him for various things. I thought it was so awkward and I should have said something... I just made sure to be really nice to him. She gave him a hard time for how he opened the bag to put the tea in and made a big deal of showing him the right way, saying \"it hurts my heart to see you do it that way,\" which is a bit dramatic. I just think it is really unprofessional to berate your co-workers in front of other customers, and it kind of turns me off of shopping there. I get new co-workers can be annoying, and that sometimes are slow on the uptake for no obvious reason.. but c'mon! Sorry dude, I thought you did okay. And she didn't really do herself any favors by acting like a martyr...",

I completely understand not supporting a certain store location with your business because of the people working there, but I don't understand what you hope to accomplish by boycotting all of the locations. It just seems like an inconvenience to yourself with no payout.",

It wasn't late, but the place was packed. The line was really long, almost out of the door, and was not moving quickly as there was only one server working. After a few minutes of waiting, a middle-aged man came out of the back(I assume he was the manager). Instead of helping serve food, this guy went ballistic on the server. I mean, he started yelling at her in broken English, calling her useless, and saying things like, \"American women can't do anything\" (he was Asian). Then, as if that wasn't bad enough, he slaps--yes, slaps!--the servers hand away from the spoon and proceeds to demonstrate how to \"properly\" spoon food. Keep in mind that the servers is an elderly woman who has served/spooned enough food in her life to know the mechanics of this simple act. \nEveryone waiting in line was visibly uncomfortable. I was fuming, but, being young and a bit cowardly at the time, I didn't have the guts to call out this guy on his utterly disgusting behavior. Instead, I said, loudly, \"I will not shop at a place that abuses their workers\" before angrily walking out the door.\nAs soon as I got into my car, I googled Panda's corporate number and left a message about what I had witnessed. The next day I got a call back where I was told that \"actions have been taken\". What those actions were was not specified and I sometimes think back about the way that that poor old lady was humiliated and abused in front of so many people. I can't help but wonder how much worse he treated her in private.\nNeedless to say, I have never set foot in Panda since then.",

(This is relevant).\n\nBefore my shift, I go to Fancy Grocery to get my dinner for the evening.

I demand to see the salmon!\"\n\nShe walks over and begins to tap at the glass display aggressively. The poor Meat Guy gives me this look, and goes over where she is asking questions on how it is seasoned, etc. While this is happening, I move her cart out of the way.

You can't control when customers are going to be rude.\"*cuts eyes to older lady*\n\nInstantly, Meat Guy smiles and takes my order. As I am waiting, he points at my work shirt and asks what I do across the street. \n\nMe: \"Oh you know, same as you. I deal wit some special kind of people.\" \n\nHe laughs and we have a decent conversation until my sandwich is ready. Older Lady just stands there and stares at me like she is trying to use the force to set me ablaze. I thank Meat Guy and tell him that I hope he has no more special customers for the rest of the day.\n\nNot the most interesting story, but it just happened and I thought I would share.",

At work one of my vendors offers training certification exams you can take and they give you special recognition showing you're a certified expert in the products they provide. The exam site is hosted by a third party vendor they went through, and has it's own login credentials to take the exams. I created an account on that site about a year ago, but didn't get around to attempting any of the exams until just this past month. Of course, when I went to log into the site I couldn't remember my account info, so I emailed their support asking to have it reset. The following exchange blew my mind:\n\nSupport:  \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; Here are your credentials. Instructions are attached.  \n&gt; Participant id – user@company.com  \n&gt; Password - password123  \n&gt; Thank you\n\nIn plan text just like that. So I replied:\n&gt; where did you get that password from?\n\nSupport:  \n&gt;Hi,  \n&gt;It was the password that was in the exam site. See the screen shot here. This participant id and password is for the exam site.  \n&gt;You will need your user name and password to get into the first log in screen once you click on the link in the instructions.\n\nThey were nice enough to attach a screenshot of their admin tools showing my password in plain text. It gets better though.  \nMe:  \n&gt;Why are our password being stored as plain text, and who has access to this information? I'm sure you can see the security concern here. \n\nSupport:  \n&gt;Only myself and another admin can see your password. We are both administrators for this program. I understand your concern but you must understand that this password is only used to access the exam site. No sensitive data can be accessed using this password, we are the only people with access to the admin site. The only thing that password can be used for is to take an exam or see the results of past exams in that account which we both already have access too.\n\n\nFrom there I sent another response pointing out that if their accounts get compromised then someone could have access to the user passwords but they just responded again with the same line about how I can trust them and nobody will compromise the passwords. This is from a company that does $25B in annual revenue. I didn't even bother bringing up the fact that they were willing to tell me my password without any kind of verification that I'm the actual owner of that account. ",

So my mom moved the cashier's cart. \n\nThis is when things got crazy. \n\nThe cashier then looks at my mom with a blank stare, and then throws (and I mean THROWS) the cart up against the wall behind us. \n\nCashier: Can I have your card please?\n\nMom: Without the attitude. \n\nAfter this the cashier then jerks our cart around (with my sister in it) and begins to scan the items in the bottom. After this my mom is furious. \n\nMom: I want to speak with your manager. \n\nThe cashier calls her manager over. \n\nAfter this, my mom explains to the manager everything that has happened. The manager quickly finishes our transaction, and gave us some free soda cups. Is we walk away, the cashier waves at us yelling in an extremely sarcastic tone \"Have a nice day mam!\".",

I have to buy larger than average condoms; whatever.

We point to the ones we want, and he points to verify our choice, latex free large.\n\nEmployee: 'These right here?'\n\nMe: 'Yes, thank you.'\n\nAt this point he gives both of us the look, as if we are trying to buy a space heater in Arizona.\n\nEmployee: 'Are you sure you want *those*?'\n\nMe: '...Yes?'\n\nPaid, left, have not gone back since.

I get my confirmation email and just chill out and watch some League of Legends while I'm waiting.  \n\nI end up waiting 45 minutes longer than the delivery time in my confirmation email and when I finally do get my pizza it's cold and it's not even the right fucking order.  I ordered a special deal with a special crust and 2 sauces(supposed to be one marinara and one cheese sauce) but what I got was a regular sausage pizza(I ordered cheese) and one buffalo ranch sauce.\n\nWHAT. THE. FUCK.\n\nSo I call up the store and since I paid in cash they said there was no way to credit me for having an incorrect order and my only option was to wait for an hour and forty-five minutes for them to get me my correct order.  \n\nNow this job requires me to be up very early and even if my pizza had got here on time it still would have been a pretty late dinner for me, and I really didn't have the time to wait for another hour and forty-five minuted(assuming the correct order is actually delivered on time) because by that time I need to be in bed.  So now I'm out about 18 dollars and it looks like I'm having ramen for dinner AGAIN.",

        "text": "First a little background: I purchased some software from a large 4 lettered internet auction website based out of that big long state with the water crisis, let's call it \"eCray\". I pay immediately for the software, and receive a download link within a couple days from a well known file sharing website. I download the linked software as a .rar and open its contents to inspect. Upon first inspection, it is pretty apparent the software is cracked. I start the returns process and after words with the seller, they initiate a refund. This is where it gets hairy. To give me a refund, apparently I have to send the item back to the seller. This should be no biggie, but since it's not a tangible item, I don't know what to do, so I decide to wait a couple days. It's about this point that eCray sends an automated message that I need to provide them with tracking info before they will refund me my money. This prompts a call to eCray's customer service so I can try to sort things out. After a couple prompts and holding for a while, I get ahold of a live body. I try to explain my situation similar to how I've just done but due to language barriers, they are convinced what I actually want is to escalate my claim and get them involved so she transfers me to another 5 minute wait and live body 2. Body 2 tells me they can't refund me my money because the purchase was software... What about your eCray money back guarantee? Apparently in my case it doesn't apply even though the page specifically said it did. At this point I try to explain to Body 2 that she has misunderstood me. Seller has already authorized my return, what I need her to do is make it so I don't need to ship Seller an empty box with a return label. I try explaining to her several more times that what she is hearing and what I am saying (several different ways) are not the same. Finally I ask to speak to someone in charge as this is clearly going nowhere fast. Apparently not only does eCray not require (insert language here) speaking CS agents to actually understand conversational (language) but they also have a large building full of employees with no bosses because she actually told me the next step up is corporate but she can't give that number out.  I thank her for her help and hang up to call Hey Hal instead. 45 seconds on the phone I was speaking to someone fluent in my native language who was capable of taking care of the issue for me. \n\nTl:dr Worst customer support I've experienced in years thanks to language barriers and low hiring standards. Also, make sure you have contingencies in place when dealing with intangible goods!",

        "text": "Ok, so a bit of background here. I'm self employed and I sell products on Amazon. Occasionally I buy small quantities of products from retail stores if they're *really* cheap, or if there's enough of them to make it worth my time.\n\nSo yesterday I was about 50 miles away from home and decided to pop into a large toy shop we have here in the UK (Not ToysRUs, but similar size and layout).\n\nOccasionally, they have a sign on products restricting the products to, say, 5 per customer. \nAnything else is fair game as far as I'm aware.\n\n\nIn their bargain corner, they had a load of kids DVDs for £1.00 each, all down from £5.99 and £8.99. The titles were between 3 and 5 years old, so the shop was no longer selling them. The products were brand new and undamaged. After fees, commission, postage etc, I worked out I could make about £2.10 on each one.\nSo I load up a trolley with about 20 of each of the 4 titles.\nI picked up two or three of another few products which weren't in the bargain corner and went to the till.\n\nSo the guy on the till starts scanning the larger items in the top of the trolley. He then looks in the bottom and sees that I have about 80 DVDs.\n\n\"I'll have to call the manager over\" - fine by me, this happens occasionally in other stores and usually they just want to check it's not a fraudulent transaction.\n\nSo the manager comes over and asks the sales assistant what the problem is. He asks if it's ok to sell so many DVDs at once. The manager turns to me and asks why I want so many.\n\nI explained honestly that I will be selling them online - I don't expect any discount or special treatment.\n\n\"You can buy one of each, but that's it.\"\n\nI was shocked at this. This is stock which the shop obviously needs to clear out, hence the discount, but also, the price tags have a date on them and they'd been discounted to £1.00 since March 2015.\n\nSo I calmly explained to him that I can't understand the problem. His store recoups £80-odd from stock which obviously isn't selling, the store also regains valuable shelf space for more profitable products, and I buy enough DVDs to turn a small profit - It's a Win-Win for us both!\n\n\"It doesn't matter, I said you can buy one of each, and that's final\"\n\nI decided that this manager wasn't worth the time I'd spend arguing with him, so I left the trolley at the checkout and said I don't have time to argue with him, and so I walked towards the door.\n\n\"Do you still want to buy these?\" he said. I turned around and he was pointing at the other £100 worth of toys I'd picked up around the shop.\n\n\"No, it's alright. I'll go to (Other large toy shop), where their staff don't dictate what customers can and can't buy!\"",

I was with my brother and cousin. We went to the drive though and in the summer, [fast food joint] has their awesome slushies. \n\nB- Brother, E1-employee one, E2-employee two, E3-employee 3.\n\nE1: Welcome to [fast food joint], how may I help you?\n\nB: Yeah, could I have a number 2 combo?\n\nE1: Will that be all?\n\nB: No, and also a-\n\nE1: Okay, that'll be X.XX.\n\nB: Um, excuse me! We're not done ordering. \n\nNo response.\n\nB: Excuse me? \n\nE1: Yeah? Your total is X.XX\n\nB: We're not done ordering, sir.\n\nE1: Oh. Well, what else did you want? *attitude*\n\nB: Just a small slushie and that's it.\n\nE1: *sighs* Your total is XX.XX\n\nWe pull up and I'm wondering what type of stick is up this guys butt. Apparently, the guy who took our order stepped down and another employee (girl) took our payment.\n\nNow, when we got the slushie...it was already in a small cup. It was clear too and someone only put less than half of the slushy inside. \n\nI was so confused and mad. So we parked and went inside the store.\n\nE3: Hi, how can I help y'all?\n\nB: Yeah, we ordered a small slushy and got this *puts cup on the counter*\n\nE3: ...oh...\n\nShe looked back at E2 who gave us our order and she was about to break out in a fit of giggles. \n\nB: Where's your manager? Can I speak to him please?\n\nE3: Of course.\n\nSo, she goes to fetch the manager and we explain ourselves to him. He instantly apologizes profusely and asks the same female employee to make the slushy again. \n\nMy brother has a short temper but knows not to cross the line. Just then, E1 appeared and was obviously in a bad mood.\n\nE1: What's wrong, buddy? Something wrong with your order? *attitude*\n\nB: Actually, yes. What's wrong with you? You don't feel like working today or what? Don't rush us when we make an order. You wind up making a mistake and waste our time. Do your job right, \"buddy\".\n\nThis employee went 0-100 really quick and was approaching the counter like he was ready to attack my brother. \n\nAs if on cue, the female employee gives us our slushy while two other employees hold back the idiot who was clearly embarrassed.\n\nMy brother thanked the manager and we exited. And I enjoyed my slushy :)",

I called Car Company Roadside Assistance to see how they could help.  The conversation that ensued was the most frustrating conversation I have ever had.  I will indicate with underscores the parts I didn't understand.  \n\nF: Welcome to Car Company Roadside Assistance.  This is Felicity.  Are you and your vehicle ______?\n\nMe: Sorry, I didn't catch the question.\n\nF: Welcome to Car Company Roadside Assistance.  This is Felicity.  Are you and your vehicle in a safe spot?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\n(A few minutes of explaining the situation, giving my contact info, and asking how they would be able to help.  She explains that they can tow me to a repair shop, but that she will not be able to guarantee that the repair shop will be open on Sundays.  I continue the conversation, thinking that she or the tow truck driver should be able to find one that is open.)\n\nF: May I have your city and state?\n\nMe: New York, New York.\n\nF: Okay, I have the state as New York.  What is the city?\n\nMe:  New York.\n\nF: Yes, New York is the state.  I need the name of the city.\n\nMe: The city is also called New York.\n\nF:  Okay.  You said you are in a parking garage.  What is the name of the garage?\n\nMe: Generic Parking Garage.\n\nF: Okay.  I have the address as [states an address].\n\nMe: No, that's not it.  There are hundreds of Generic Parking Garages in New York.  I need to give you the address.  \n(There are actually probably only dozens, but I was guessing.)\n\nF: Okay, what is the address?\n\nMe: 10 W 53rd St.\n(not the real address, but the format is the same, which is important for this story)\n\nF: Okay, thank you.  I am locating it.  (Long pause.)  Okay, I see it is located at _____ bicycle parkway and W 53rd St.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, what was that about “bicycle parkway”?  I don't know what that is.\n\nF: W 53rd St.\n\nMe: No, the other part.  About “bicycle parkway”.  I don't think that's right.\n\nF: Okay.  I will look again for 10 W 53rd St.  (pause)  Okay, I have found 53 W 10th St.\n\nMe: What?  No, that's not the address.  It was 10 W 53rd St.  West 53rd St is the name of the street.  10 is the number of the parking garage.  Anyway, I just don't think we are able to communicate.  Is there someone else I can talk to?  A supervisor, maybe?  I can't keep trying to explain this.  \n\nF: Yes, there is someone else you can talk to.  Please hold.  (short pause) I have put you in line to speak with ______, but they are busy.  In the meantime, would you like to keep trying?\n\nMe: Okay, that's fine.  Thank you.  I will give you the address again: 10 W 53rd St.\n\nF: 10 W 53rd St.  What is the cross street?\n\nMe: Fifth Avenue.\n\nF: Okay.  I have W 10th St and Fifth Avenue.\n\nMe: No!  It is not 10th Street!  It is West 53rd Street!  I told you that before!  Is the supervisor available yet?  This is not working.\n\nF: Yes, the supervisor is still busy.  You will be next.  Can I verify that it is W 53rd St and Fifth Avenue?  \n\nMe: Yes, that's correct.\n\nF: Okay, I can send a tow truck to your location.  The vehicle will be towed to the Car Company Dealership at 100 ______ St -\n\nMe: Sorry, could you spell the name of the street?\n\nF: (slowly) C as in cow, O as in ostrich\n\nMe: It's okay, you can just spell it regularly.\n\nF: C-O-R-P-O-R-A-L\n\nMe: Okay, 100 Corporal St \n(address also changed)\n\nF: Yes, 100 Corporal St in Secaucus, New Jersey\n\nMe: Secaucus!?  \n(that's a long way to go to fix a flat tire!)\n\nF: S-E-C-\n\nMe: No, you don't need to spell it.  That's just really far away.\n\n(She told me that was the closest option, and we discussed briefly the logistics of the situation, but then I told her to hold on while I consulted my family.  We decided that we would hire a tow truck ourselves if necessary and forget about Car Company Roadside Assistance.  I thanked her and told her that I would not be using their services.  It turns out the place she was having the car towed to wasn't open on Sundays, so I would have had to stay an extra day in New York and miss a day of work just to fix a flat tire!  We managed to refill our tire with air to make the car temporarily drivable and drove to a tire shop, where the repair took less time than that phone conversation.)",

I was at a pet store buying dog treats, and spoke with the girl behind the counter (C). \n\nMe: Hi! How much are the mini dog donuts? \n\nC: They're $2.50 for two donuts. \n\nMe: Okay! How much would it be for three donuts? (They came in three flavors so I thought I would get one of each) \n\nC: Sorry, we only sell them in pairs. \n\nMe: Oh okay. Well I'll get four then. \n\nC: Would you like to make it a half dozen for only two dollars more? We currently have a promotion for a half dozen.  \n\nMe: Um.... Okay sure. I'll get two of each flavor please. \n\nC: Okay. \n\nShe starts bagging the donuts, and I'm not actually watching closely, but I realize she seems to be putting *quite* a lot more than half a dozen in the bag. \n\nC: That'll be $12 plus tax. \n\nMe: (confused) Actually, I'm sorry, I think I'll just get the four donuts... \n\nC: Okay, no problem. That'll be $10 plus tax. \n\nMe: ... No, no. I just want 4 donuts, not 4 pairs of donuts. \n\nC: ... Alright. \n\nSo that's the story of how I went in wanting to buy three donuts and almost walked out with 12. Is it normal to promote a half dozen *pairs* of donuts instead of simply a bag of 12? Either way, I think we both could've been clearer. What do you guys think? ",

I wanted to share an experience I had to today at a popular activewear store that has just been on my mind all day.\n\nI came into the store to return an item I bought this past Monday and while I was browsing around I noticed that another top (not the one I was returning) I purchased that same Monday was now on sale. The difference was $20, so pretty significant! I explained my situation to a sales associate and asked if the store would do a price adjustment. She pretty much said no even though I bought it less than a week ago and it was the same style and color. I asked \"Wouldn't I be able to just come back tomorrow and return it and rebuy it?\" She replied \"Uh...We can't stop you, but it's not right ethically.\" I didn't push the issue further, I know there's probably not much she could do about it. What bothered me was what she said about it not being ethical. I understand that every company has their own policies and may not do price adjustments, but is it really unethical for me to return and rebuy? $20 is a big difference and I feel kind of cheated that I paid more than I had to for this top.\n\nI've worked retail for several years before graduating with my nursing degree so I see where the SA is coming from, but what she said has stuck with me all day... What do y'all think?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for everyone's input! I'm going to return the shirt.",

He was ranting about how he had asked for that booth earlier and was told by the hostess that he couldn't sit there since it was for four people. \n\nHe was rude to his server, yelling about how horrible the hostess was, and he was screaming for a manager. When a manager finally came over, he ranted about how unprofessional the hostess was as the hostess walked by to seat another party of two in a four-seater booth and he went off again about how terrible she is. He demanded corporate's number and everyone's name involved.\n\nAt this point, he had pretty much attracted the attention of the entire restaurant. We were all looking at him and he was just going on and on. He got the numbers and names he needed and then stormed off with his to-go box.

I do it to help others, so hobby?). I flew to another state to buy a beautiful, smart and rare breed of dog. As she is still in training I was just going to crate her rather then deal with taking her threw busy airports. Well, apparently 85degrees is the upper limit for cargo dogs. So they wanted me to fly in the morning, maybe if it cools down, in the Midwest. I said \"well, she is a service dog, and can fly in the cabin with me instead.\" \n\nThat went over well, \n\n\"we need proof\" \n\n\"asking for proof is like asking someone in a wheelchair for proof that they need the wheelchair, and is a violation of the ada.\" \n\nThis went right over the ladies head... she calls her manager. She then informs me again that i need the paper work. I step outside and call customer service for ... they tell me to ask for a ... well I get the manager and say the same thing about being a service dog. He gets it, and realizes how much he F'ed up. He gets me on my flight. Dog travels amazingly well for her first adventure into a crowded place, and on a plane.\n\n\nThen they tried to pull the same thing in my connecting city.\n\n I got so angry after the new manager told the desk lady to let me fly, and then the desk lady argued with her manager to not let me fly... i said \"keep me and my dog from this flight and I'm calling a lawyer, as this would be an actionable violation of the Americans with disabilities act.\" She gave me this really nasty look, and I think her manager was about to rip her head off. She let me on, I think she mispronounced my last name (its similar to the body part that makes a guy a guy).\n\nI'm calling customer service tomorrow. I will never fly ..... again unless they do something to make up for this ridiculous screw up. \n\nE: fixed some errors for clarity. I also probably should have mentioned that I actually have a disability, it's how I started training service dogs. Also this dog will likely be my personal service dog. \n\nE2: the ticket agents both asked me for a doctors note, and what she was helping me with. This is why I got upset. Without directly asking me what my disability was, they were. Also I posted this in a few comments so I guess i should add it here: \n\n I forgot to put in the conversation i was having as she was checking me in\n\nIt went something like this:\n\"What a cute dog! What kind is she.\"\n\"Thank you, she is a _____ .\"\n\"Ohh I've never heard of them.\"\n\"They are very smart and make great companions. I'm training her as a service dog.\"\n\"Ohhh, well your going to have problems. it looks like she cant fly in the cargo as your destination is too hot.\"\n\"Ohh well as a service dog she can just ride in the cabin with me instead.\"\n\nThat's when things went down hill. \n\n\nI'm generally a chatty kathy and a dog tends to draw attention. I usually explain she is a service dog quickly so i can tell them not to pet her while she is working. ",

        "text": "A couple years ago, I was in the process of moving into a new apartment.  During the move, I managed to break my big toe, which I didn't realize at the time.  A few hours later, I realized that something was wrong, and fixed it to the best of my ability.  Ended up having to go to an urgent care a few days later, because the toe was still bleeding slightly.\n\nThe doctor and staff advised me that the toe was broken, and provided me with a set of crutches to use before I could see a primary care doctor.  Those things were very awkward, but I used them for a little while.  I didn't go out very often, but I had to do a little bit of grocery shopping while I still had the crutches.\n\nTurned out to be a good thing that I still had those things.  It was still very awkward to use them, I definitely wasn't skilled at it by any means.  However, as I was walking into the grocery store, I passed a woman at the self serve station.  Going on my way, I somehow found a slippery patch of linoleum.  Due to the PERFECT configuration of my crutches at the exact moment, I started to slip, and they were precisely placed to prevent my fall.  Of course, the lady rushed to check on my status, and I probably would have had plenty of proof that it was a genuine accident.  But fortunately, the crutches saved me, and I had no further injuries.  I certainly was grateful, I didn't want to add other broken bones to the broken toe.\n\nSo that's my story of how falls are preventable.  Just keep a pair of crutches handy and in perpetual position to catch you if you start to fall.  At least it was obvious that I wasn't try to fake a fall or anything, it wouldn't have been worth it.  Even a genuine fall wouldn't have been worth it, to be honest.",

She held up the smaller bag and asked if that was all right, I said it was, and then she set the smaller bag down and put the lobster into the contaminated hat bag.

I asked why. She said it was company law and I had to. I said I didn't want to. She said her supervisor might need to call me, and I asked why he would need to call me over a stuffed lobster. She glared at me, then pulled out her cell phone and called who I guess was her manager, who she spoke to very angrily i  a language I couldn't identify. Eventually she hung up, looked surprised to see I was still there, and waved her hands at me, saying \"okay; go!\",\n\nSo I went, sans hat-lobster.",

Would you like the Rice? \n\n&gt;Me: No, Thank you.\n\nAnd I leave. Story over right?\n\nI get home and get ready to dive into my chicken. I pull out the sauce and it's some sort of sweet heat sauce. IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME COLOR. BBQ comes in a red packet and the sweet heat comes in a blue packet. \n\nI gave up. I didn't go back. Lesson learned by me: Always check the damn bag. ",

I figured it was fair price since the other six packs of seasonal beer we're going for $6-$8. I had a four pack. The only other price I'd seen for that particular beer was at Whole Foods for $15, which was insane. \n\nNow thinking about it, I'm worried I got her in trouble. I've had her as a cashier before and she's super nice, young lady probably college. Did I do th right thing? Should I have asked for a manager to get a price check on beer?",

        "text": "Yesterday after work (I'm a teacher) I stopped at a store to get a bunch of stuff and as I selected a register from somewhat lengthy lines, I was quite exhausted and relieved to be done with the week.\n\nA few details that may contextualize this story: I'm diabetic and had only an hour prior to this been severely low and nearly passed out at school; safety officers and the nurse were called and I was monitored for about half an hour while I ate honey, a Nut Roll, and glucose tabs. I was still a little mentally hazy when I got to the store. Additionally, I have very light hair and almost no eyelashes, so I do wear false eyelashes every day; they were irritating me a lot at that point.\n\nSo I was standing in line, putting all of my items on the belt. Shortly after, two women joined the line. I noticed them, but only in passing. One took notice of the lengthy lines and made a loud sigh in my direction as if I were taking forever and then made a comment about checking for another line that was moving faster. When she left the line to do so, I happened to glance in her direction. At this point, evidently I made some sort of facial expression.\n\n\"I saw that, you bitch. Your little look. Think you're so special.\" The other lady shouted this at me, moving around her cart to get closer.\n\nI was dumbfounded. \"What? What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe did this whole \"raised eyebrows, sarcastic eye roll to the side\" sort of move. \"Don't lie, I know what I saw.\"\n\nIf she saw me do any sort of facial expression, it was awkward blinking due to my false lashes. If anything, it was ill timing. \"I didn't do anything like that, are you insane?\"\n\nThe other lady came back at this point. \"What's going on?\" she asked, as she saw the other all angry.\n\n\"This bitch made some eyes at you when you said you were going to another lane. And she's lying about it.\"\n\n\"Oh hell no. I can do what I want. No one can pull that shit.\"\n\nI was really cranky. Low blood sugar, end of the week, my last class had a few kids that I'd caught cheating on a state test - and I'd just been accused of something silly. \"You know, if you think you saw something, you're wrong. You should take some sort of class in facial expression interpretation if you're struggling that much.\" It was pretty much the dumbest comeback and later I thought of so many better things to say, but it is what it is.\n\nThe lady that had confronted me started screaming. \"What did you say? Oh bitch you best be glad I don't want to go back to jail because I'd beat you down right now!\" She got right up close to me in my face.\n\nWhen I'm confronted with irrational anger, I have two reactions: to get verbal and to laugh. I did not move from my spot - didn't even lean away from her. I started to giggle at her fury, then yelled, \"Calm the fuck down, bitch! Nobody did anything to you!\" And then I laughed again.\n\nAll of the customers and cashiers started staring. Other cashiers ran over and I heard someone say, \"Call security.\"\n\nAngry bitch's mother (the other lady) decided to step between us, despite my never having made a physically aggressive move in the slightest. \"Don't worry, I'll protect my daughter.\"\n\nI kept laughing now and then, somewhat scared.\n\nA manager came up and yelled for the ladies to calm down. I appeared fairly calm so I didn't get spoken to at that moment. It was then that the ladies were even more incensed. \"Oh yeah? Tell at the minorities, right? White manager gonna side with the white girl, huh? That how [store] works? You're lucky this is the only place that sells [whatever thing it was, I don't recall], because we'd shop somewhere else! Racists, all of you!\"\n\nI laughed super hard at this point. I had just come from school. An inner-city charter school. Where I have no white students. And I didn't even know these women's race - they looked white-ish, maybe they were Latina? - but it didn't matter. It had nothing to do with race and I'm pretty much as far from a racist as can be, so I laughed without explaining why it was so ludicrous.\n\nAt this point, it was my turn. As luck would have it, I'd had that cashier a week or two ago and remembered her particularly because I'd been there late at night and had a lengthy conversation with her about school and colleges she was applying to. She was extremely friendly and she remembered me as well. So I ignored the ladies behind me, who were very aggressively mocking my every comment and movement, occasionally muttering, \"she's lucky I don't want to go back to jail.\"\n\nSecurity showed up and spoke to me because I was at the end of the checkout, finishing up. \"We have a problem here?\"\n\n\"Apparently I made some sort of 'eyes' at one of these ladies and that was enough to set this all off?\" I pointed at the women behind me.\n\n\"Yeah, she got all mad that I was going to check for a shorter lane and then slapped my daughter's face and called her names!\" \n\nI laughed again, mainly because there were like 20 witnesses that could verify the level of bullshit in that version of events.\n\n\"There was some bad language used?\" security asked.\n\nI shrugged. \"Yeah, I swore a bit. It is what it is.\"\n\nHe said, \"this is a family place and you can't be doing that.\"\n\nBut what about getting in my face and threatening assault? I didn't ask this out loud. \"I know, I'm about to leave.\"\n\nThe women continued to mock and passively threaten me until I left. What boggles my mind is that even if I HAD made some weird facial expression, this was a super vast over-reaction to it. I was pretty terrified of these ladies the whole time, hence my laughter and was definitely cranky from recovering from my hypoglycemia, so after the alleged inciting incident, I do acknowledge that my actions probably didn't help.\n\nBut still. \n\nTL; DR: Bunch of over-reacting bean bag chairs masquerading as human beings accused me of looking at them weird in line. Threaten me as I giggle at them.",

So I go to the local hardware store and load up 3 carts/flatbeds with all the wood and other materials I needed for the project. I go to checkout and pick a line. The checkout goes smooth until the gallon bucket of paint comes up. You need to be 18 to buy any sort of spray can or paint product so I already have my I.D. out and hand it over to the cashier. She looks it over and tells me that I'm not 18 (19 at time). I tell her that I am, my age, and my birth date and to look again. She looks again and points to the area that says my birthday and says that I'm too young. I go to grab my I.D. and she won't give it back and calls the manager over. He comes over and the cashier tells him \"this snotty kid wants to buy paint and huff it.\" Manager asks me what my plan is. I tell him all the details, show him my blueprints, and he then looks over the card and tells me it's fake. I tell them to put the I.D. number into the computer or swipe it and see. Get told that I can't buy paint and that they won't swipe the card. I've already been in line for close to 30 minutes and am getting fed up about the I.D. stuff and what the cashier called me. I then take my card and walk towards the door. Manager calls me back so I walk over and he offers me a small discount after noticing that the bill was close to $900 but I can't have the paint. I tell him no and explain that I should be allowed to buy paint and should not have an employee talk about me like that when I'm 5' away. I then tell him that I understand huffing spray cans but to huff a gallon bucket didn't even make sense, especially since I showed the entire plan and blueprint I had. I leave all the stuff there and walk out and he then asks how I expect all the stuff to get out of the way and restocked, I say \"figure it out yourself\" without turning around and leave. Went to another store and had no problems and they even gave me a discount by saying I was a contractor and helped me load my truck.",

        "text": "Edit 2: Tracking says that they will try to deliver the package again at an unknown date. I am assuming that's a standard message since I requested to pick it up in person.\n\nEdit 1: So at 3:30 the mail lady came to the neighborhood. She basically rushed down the street, and two minutes later she rushed back up the street, and then back down it again. After about five minutes she pulled into my development, put the mail in the mailboxes, then sped up and drove back down that street AGAIN. It was obvious she was rushing around. My mom told me when she was driving home and pulling onto the street she was there, parked in the middle of the street.\n\nWith that in mind I want to send in a complaint, but not sure how to do it. I assume I do it at the local post office rather than call USPS up. &lt;&lt;\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nSo a few weeks back I ordered an item off of Ebay from Japan and it was due to arrive today---tracking indicated that it was out for delivery. Usually they ring the doorbell and if you do not get there in time they leave the package on your front porch. Normally mail is delivered around 2pm, sometimes (but rarely) 3pm.\n\nThis morning I check tracking and it says it is out for delivery, which I was happy about. Around 2pm I decided to check tracking, and it had said that they had attempted to deliver at 12:43 but no \"authorized recipient\" was available. Which I thought was weird as my mom and I were both home, and we would of heard them if they had knocked or rung the doorbell.\n\nThe tracking said that there was a notice left. I checked the front porch. Nothing. I checked the neighbour's front porches. Nothing. I checked the mailbox. Nothing, not even mail. (No use checking the backyard as that is fenced in, and hard to tell which townhouse is which.)\n\nI tried calling, and basically struggled with the automatic machine. After that they were going to transfer me to real people, but then I would have to sit on the phone and wait for however long. \n\nI went to their redelivery page and just set it up for a in-post office pick up. I assume I will have to wait until tomorrow or Saturday since I doubt the mail person get back there until 5pm, when the post office closes. \n\nMy area used to have this wonderful maillady. She would go above and beyond what I think a mail person should do. Sadly she retired last year. The mailman we had both our new one was sketchy. Letters, such as bills, would never make it to their destination. The lady we have now is okay-ish, but every time I see her she's talking on her cellphone. \n\nHonestly, with there being no mail in the mailbox and no delivery attempted notice, I wonder if the mail lady has even made it to our area yet.

Well Monday came and went, so on Tuesday I looked up the tracking number and it said that there was an issue at the depot and that it was delayed. This morning another company (who are based about 15 miles away from where I am) phoned to tell me that they had my parcel, which was given to them by mistake with their delivery. They had tried calling the courier themselves but had no luck as they didn't have any tracking numbers etc.\n\nNo problems I thought, I will have all the details with my order, searched the couriers website and only found a text chat option. This is the following conversation it had:\n\n&gt;Here is the copy of your recent chat that you requested.\nGeneral Info\nChat start time\t Sep 16, 2015 6:51:21 AM EST\nChat end time\t Sep 16, 2015 7:27:33 AM EST\nDuration (actual chatting time)\t 00:36:12\nOperator\tM\nChat Transcript\ninfo: Welcome to the Courier live chat Service.  An advisor will be with you shortly.  \ninfo: You are now connected with M\n\nM: Good morning A how can I help today? \n\nA: Hi. Courier were meant to deliver a parcel on Monday but it says it was delayed. I've just received a phone call from another company telling me that they have my parcel.\n\nM: Please could you confirm the full name and address that should be on your parcel?\n\nA: this is my reference number\n\nA: JJD*****\n\nA: its A. Last name\n\nA: Name of company\n\nA: Address of Company\n\nM: Thank you.\n\nM: Can you give me a minute or two to look into this for you?\n\nA: yes that’s no problem\n\nM: Thank you.\n\nM: The parcel has unfortunately been delayed and we are working with the depot to resolve this, please keep an eye on the tracking as it will update when we have an update regarding your parcel \n\nA: yes. it’s been delayed because it has been delivered to another address\n\nA: I have the address of the company here\n\nA: Name &amp; Address of other Company \n\nM: Thank you.\n\nM: Can you give me a minute or two to look into this for you?\n\nA: yep\n\nM: Thank you.\n\nM: The parcel has not been delivered\n\nA: yes, it has. It got delivered with a bunch of other bubble wrap. The company rang me and told me. \n\nA Courier person already went back but they couldn't find it. But now they have\n\nM: Do you have the parcel? \n\nA: No.I don't have it, it got delivered by mistake to another company\n\nM: I see, is it a neighbour the other company? \n\nA: No. they are in another town. It got added to their delivery by mistake\n\nM: I am sorry to hear this, my advice would be to contact the sender to have them look further into this\n \nA: It’s your mistake. I have all the relevant information for you to collect the parcel from the other company and deliver it to the right company\n\nM: I understand your frustration regarding this however as the tracking indicates the parcel has not been delivered you would need to contact the sender regarding this \n\nA: do you have a phone number I can contact you on? This is your error and I need to speak to someone higher up since you do not seem to understand the issue\n\nM: I'm afraid we only have an automated number \n\nA: They won’t have signed for it because it got put in by mistake with their delivery. So instead of 9 parcels they had 10. And the tenth parcel was mine\n\nA: but they only signed for their 9\n\nA: and so when the driver comes to deliver my parcel he is missing one\n\nA: I know where my parcel is. It hasn't been signed for. Your company has lost it. I know where it is. I can tell you where it is. You can go and collect it from this place. And then deliver it to the right place.\n\nM: The parcel is currently delayed \n\nA: yes. Because you've lost it\n\nM: My advice would be to contact the sender to have them look into this \n\nA: can I talk to your manager\n\nM: The same advice will be provided \n\nA: why? It’s not the sender’s issue. It’s your company who lost the parcel. \n\nA: Well?\n\nM: My advice would be to contact the sender to have them look into this further or check to see if the tracking updates within 24 hours \n\nA: it won’t update because you’ve lost the parcel\n\nA: it was due on Monday!\n\nA: I have already waited 24 hrs\n\nA: this is why I’m contacting you now\n\nM: I understand this however I have advised as much as I can \n\nA: you’ve not advised me at all\n\nA: why can’t you collect the parcel\n\nA: and deliver it to me\n\nM: My advice would be to contact the sender \n\nA: they say it’s not their issue\n\nA: I’m on the phone with them now\n\nM: Thank you.\n\nM: Is there anything else I can help you with today? \n\nA: yes\n\nA: you can have my parcel delivered to me\n\nM: I can not guarantee this \n\nM: I will leave you with the sender \n\nM: Take care A\n\nM: Many thanks for contacting Courier. The chat will automatically close in 60 seconds unless you have another question. If there's anything else we can do for you in the future please do not hesitate to come back to us. \n\ninfo: Chat session has been terminated by the site operator.\n\n\nSo I was on the phone with the people I ordered from at this point, to a very nice lady. She just couldn't believe that they were telling me to wait 24hrs. She then arranged to have the parcel picked up tomorrow via courier, so that it was official that they've messed up. She also put in loads of notes about how I tried to resolve it but they keep saying the same thing over and over. \nShe very nicely said that there would be no charge for the product as we should have to order more to cover for it (i did order more because I'd ran out by this point) she also said that she would throw in a free box of chocolates.\n\nEverything has been resolved no thanks to the original courier.",

Come to find out, there are no one but TWO couponers in both check out lines. The first cashier we'll call her Rosy ( not her real name ) , was clueless how to manually take off a coupon. After she called over her manager it turns out the coupon expired three years ago. The lady refuses to leave with her Four dollar off B vitamins. The only thing this woman purchased was Cat liter and vitamins all of which she had at least one coupon for. After Rosy goes through he coupons again, she realized all of these coupons had expired. The computer accepted about half of them, but the other half were rejected. The customer was annoyed, and opened her cat liter ( it was in a bag) and started to throw it at Rosy and the customers behind her. Cat liter everywhere ! The manger comes back over and asks her \"What the hell is wrong with you?\"  The cops are called , they arrest this woman, she doesn't get her vitamins or her cat liter. \n\nLooking at the other line, they are trying to use a Store coupon( which apparently are on cell phones now) on clearance children's clothing. Everyone knows that coupons exclude clearance items. Except these people, the cashier, manager and customers told her the coupon could not be used. This woman was just stupid or trying to get her way. She had an entire coupon \"book\" , coupon policy of every store in the county, plus her cellphone with the company's main number saved a contact. \nShe had a 30% off coupon, while I was listening she had a total of 20.57 for her 100 PIECES of clearance kid clothing in various sizes. She had 80 % savings from clearance I think she was being greedy, but any way. She called over the SM(store Manger) and made a big deal of her spending tons of money in this store and how this is an outrage. \nThe SM isn't dealing with this after the cat liter issue, she says either pay the 20.57 or get the hell out. The woman leaves all of her items and the Manager puts the clothing in a cart to be hung back up. Meanwhile the assistant to said SM is bring over 100 Dollar gift cards for dealing with this. \nAll of this is 100 % true from a big box store. Same day, and this all occurred while I waited in line for 30 minutes. \n\nI still have this gift card as I refuse to back to their store. \n\n\n*Sorry If I did something wrong this is my first official post* ",

I wanted a new pair for work. \n\nSize 9 shoes. \n\nShoes arrived today. They are a size 7. The online confirmation, the invoice that arrived with it, AND the box all say size 9. Everything but the actual shoes. \n\nI'm bummed because I really wanted to break them in before work on Wednesday. \n\nUpdate: I called the customer service number &amp; Amy answered. Not her real name but hellashort enough to  type again.  \n\nWhen I told her what had happened, she we baffled.  She told me that if I sent them back via FedEx, called them with the tracking number, she would have the correct shoes out within 2 days so they would arrive on Thursday (which is today).\n\nI had to go print off the return slip and the tracking info from FedEx and take it to their office. I immediately call them with the tracking number but their website hadn't been updated so to check on fedexs website for when it went online and call back. He said he typed in the tracking info so I wouldn't have to repeat it. \n\nAbout half an hour later, I saw it went online and called back. This lady had a bit of an attitude with me and made me verify my whole story again, even though it was in the notes. \nThen she puts me on hold and comes back to tell me that she processed the order and the shoes should arrive on Thursday. Okay awesome.\n\nI get an email about an hour later, stating my return will be processed back onto my card. I check my card info and I noticed that the price of the shoes was taken out (~$30). I've been waiting for the return to happen because they've now charged me for the same pair of shoes twice. \n\nI'm giving them the benefit of doubt that when they processed the new order, they had to charge me for it. \n\nBut I'm still waiting on that refund. \n\nI'm giving them one more business day, one phone call, then I'm going to tell my bank that it needs to be reversed.

I asked for a service transfer to the LuminousResidence company and I scheduled it to be between 12-2pm. No big deal, the chat service is convenient and I'm going to be unpacking in those two hours and then head out to gather supplies, no problem.\n\nThe day of transfer comes, so does 12... 1... 2... And no one from LuminousResidence has called or shown up. I call their customer service, they locate the technicians and tell me that they would be 30 min. late. Ok, no problem, shit happens and I'll wait another 30 minutes.\n\nBy 3:00 pm I was getting a little impatient, so I call again and they tell me they cannot locate the technicians but that they should be here soon. By 3:20 they finally show up, they install my internet in 20 minutes, we sign their sheet and they leave.\n\nI was checking over the sheet to find my account number and what do I find? That in the \"Arrival Time/Depart Time\" they wrote down that they got here at 12:00 and left at 1:00 pm. WHAT?! \n\nI contacted customer service again and I was only told that I would receive a call between 24-48 hrs later. So far, there have been no calls. \n\nI wouldn't have minded waiting 30 extra minutes, but 1:20 hrs of my time wasted for 20 min of work? That's a no.\n\nAny suggestions as to how to deal with this further?\n\n**UPDATE**: Finally received a call from... Someone. She said that she would credit our account a little discount (40% off, heh) and that she would pass the comments onto the Supervisor.\n\n**2nd UPDATE**: I e-mailed corporate as /u/I_SHIT_A_BRICK suggested and gave a very detailed account of the things that happened. Surprisingly enough I was called just 20 min. ago and the response? They appreciate it, it's great, they're glad that customers like me let them know about these things going on and *\"we'll let their manager know so they can take care of it.\"*",

This was done at an out-of-town facility that did procedures for a wide area. The place had a deal with a local hotel; we checked in to the hotel, were shuttled over to the doctor, had the surgery, and got shuttled back to the hotel, where we were supposed to go to sleep immediately. Do NOT drive home before the next morning.\n\nThe reason for the mandatory nap was that they made us comfortable with the thought of lasers and sharp blades to the eye by use of a really, really good happy pill administered about 15 minutes before the surgery. You stayed alert and relaxed (and did I mention happy?) for long enough for the surgery, then got really sleepy.\n\nIt would be a Bad Thing to rub your eyes for a few days, and bright lights would be uncomfortable also. The solution for both was tinted ski goggles, secured with surgical tape while sleeping to prevent you from moving them. You can take the tape off while you are awake.\n\nAll went as expected, and we slept like logs starting at about noon. We both woke up sometime in the night, hungry but still really, really happy. We remembered there was a [supermegamart] just down the hill from the hotel; they would have munchies!\n\nWalk over. It’s dark, we’re wearing tinted ski goggles, but who cares! We laugh like crazy most of the way there. OH! Now we notice that we are still wearing flannel pajamas and bathrobes! We forgot to get dressed! That’s *funny!*\n\nEnter the Mart. It’s almost empty! Must be later than we thought. On to munchies! Get several bags of Doritos, and see a display of sunglasses. Realize we can wear non-prescription sunglasses now! Slide the goggles up on our foreheads and try some! Wow, most of these look so bad it’s funny... especially when you are drugged out of your $#&amp; mind, and also wearing ski goggles! More laughter. HA! \nFunny! Funny!\n\nStore clerk from about fifteen feet away, and holding a garden fork: “Um… can I help you with something?”\n\n“No, thanks! We’re just looking!” And that was hilarious!\n\n“Um. You do know we’re closed, don’t you?”\n\n“What? When? We just got here! And supermegamart never closes!”\n\n“Yeah, this one does, at midnight. It’s three AM. We were closed when you walked in.”\n\n“Why didn’t someone say something!”\n\n“No one wanted to get close to you.”\n\nWife: “Except you! You’re braver than everyone else!”\n\n“Yeah. But I’m fifteen feet away and holding a pitchfork. Would you mind leaving?”\n\n“Sure! But, we have to pay for these chips. Wait, my wallet is in my pants!” (And that’s *funny!*)\n\n“No, you can just keep the chips. Are you guys on drugs, or something? Why the goggles?”\n\n“Yep! We’re on drugs. Big time! The goggles are to keep our laser-eyes safe. Else they might … well we don’t know, exactly, but something **BAD!**”\n\nIt went on like this while we were escorted out by Mr. Pitchfork, who stayed a comfortable distance away. He declined our offer to share our free chips.",

        "text": "So, about three years ago I decided to move within the same city in Germany because my flatmate moved out and renting that place alone was a bit over my budget. Turns out I'm in a larger apartment paying less, but that's another story.\n\nSo, since I have a phone line with broadband, that line needed to move with me. So I called the telephone company and told them when I was moving and where I was moving with enough notice, because for some reason technicians their technician's schedule fill up really quickly.\n\nThe whole thing went relatively uneventfully, although they did want to upsell me their triple play IPTV package, but all I wanted was telephone and (their cheapest) broadband service and the two something Euro fee for unlimited calls to European landlines (For some reason Canada, USA and Australia are included in that package as well). The call centre agent finishes the transaction on their end and tells me that in the next couple of days I'll be getting a confirmation letter in the mail where I can review the details. We say goodbye and the call ends there.\n\nA couple of days later I get two letters in the mail with two service change confirmations (each with a fee) with the same date of execution, same cancellation of service at my old address and provision of service at my new address. These letters have two different process numbers on them, so I decide to get on the phone with their 0800 number and sort out why there are two processes.\n\nSo I get this guy who seems to be very relaxed about things. I give him my customer number, confirm my personal details and tell him that I am moving and that I got two service confirmations with separate process numbers. The conversation goes more or less as follows:\n\n* He tells me that there is only one process open on my file. \n* I tell him whether he can tell me what process number that has and ask whether he can tell me what happened with the other process number.\n* He ignores my question and says there is only one request open.\n* I again ask him to tell me the process number for that request and to tell me the status of the other process number.\n* He ignores me and tells me everything will be fine (WTF!?)\n* I tell him that I have two confirmations from [telephone company] one with process number 12345 and another with number 09876, and that I would like the status on both of these processes.\n\nAnd then he drops this gem:\n&gt; Mr [chub70199], get and beer and go sit in the balcony. The weather is lovely today.\n\nAnd at this I just hung up.\n\nToo bad I hadn't written the name and the time of the call down, because I would have loved to make a formal complaint about this.\n\nIn the end it turns out one process had likely been opened in error, because two days later I got a letter in the mail that process 12345 had been cancelled.\n\n",

Essentially, the way it works is you get a tray and a liner, place items you want to buy on the tray, go to the cash register, pay, and then can pack things into a paper bag in a separate area and be on your merry way.\n\nSo I had a couple of minutes to spare before catching my tram and I decided to buy breakfast amidst the morning rush: a muffin and a doughnut. I place them on the tray, queue up at the cash register and wait for my turn. People line up behind me. So far, so uneventful.\n\nCome my turn, the girl at the register (who must have been new and somewhat rude, because I didn't even get a \"hello\"), punches in my muffin and then starts looking for the icon to punch in the doughnut. Apparently she isn't finding it right away.\n\nThe woman behind me gets restless and says something to the effect of her being charged first as she is in a hurry and my order could take time. She holds up her items so the cahier can see them.\n\nI answer back\n* I'm sorry, but I was first!\n\nThe cashier, without a word cancels my transaction and processes that woman's purchase and quotes her total.\n\nMe, totally dumbstruck mumbled something about not wanting whatever I had taken on the tray anymore and walked out, leaving the tray on the rails by the cash register.\n\nI'm still upset I didn't give the cashier or the pushy woman a piece of my mind.",

I handed the cashier $20.03. Now, anybody with a basic grasp of mathematics and a modicum of common sense would know that I should get $15 back, right? Not this lady.\n\nShe hands me $15.58.\n\nI tried to give a quick explanation and hand back the overage, but she prints my receipt and holds it in front of my face, and sure enough, the computer had forgotten to... compute.\n\n#$  5.03 Total  \n#$20.03 Tender  \n#$15.58 Change\n\nAt first I was confused, how could a machine get it wrong? But then she said, \"It's been doing this all day, it crashed this afternoon and it's been giving me trouble ever since.\" At this point I give up and leave with my pizza, my water, and my extra 58 cents.",

        "text": "This story occurred at a grocery store.\n\nI had popped into the store that day to pick up some raspberries, because I really loved raspberries. Just raspberries. My small number of items allowed me to line up for the \"Express Line.\"\n\nAlthough it was the express line, there were actually quite a number of people there and I ended up waiting about ten minutes. When she finally rang up my berries, I reach into my purse to get my wallet when I realize, it was in my other purse at home!\n\nI awkwardly fumbled through my purse, trying to scrounge up enough loose change, when I heard a loud voice behind me yell, \"What? She can't pay for it?\"\n\nI turn to face a 60 year old Italian Man. I mumble something about forgetting my wallet and that I'll just leave them and come back another time. I slowly backed up and tried to slink away.\n\nJovially, he exclaims, \"I'll pay for them! How much are they?\" The cashier perks up and says $4. The man waves me off, \"Yes! Put the berries on my bill! Let the girl have it!\" He seems pretty happy with himself.\n\nI thank him profusely and silently promise myself I will pay this forward to another stranger. This happened years ago, but I'll never forget it. What a nice, nice man.\n\nThanks again, Loud Italian Man who paid for my raspberries. They were extra delicious because of your good deed.",
