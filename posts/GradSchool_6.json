I am only a masters student so I only have one year left but I am miserable here and hate everyone. I had another professor who was so disinterested in working with me after 5 minutues of speaking online, he proceeded to tell me a story about how he tried to get his last MS student kicked out.. One of the professors who runs my program told me this sentence, \"Our program has failed you and I am so sorry you uprooted your life to come here. I am disappointed in my faculty members.\" Like thank you for the sentiment of your words but this program is probably gonna set me 20 steps further back from getting into a PhD now.",

Rather, I have found that it is really only worthwhile coupled with something more applied, but I want to demonstrate that I have enough grit to rebuild myself after previous failures, and thus, finish it out. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice as to how they proved to a new program that they could do the work, even after being dismissed from a previous one? I want to ensure my application is as strong as possible, so that I can complete the degree successfully, move on to my next bigger career goal, and finally BREATHE again.",

I dont even know if that counts for anything but I presented the research at a conference and am published as a first author in the university's anthology for the year. I also work full time while going to school. \n\nSo, how many hours should I try to block out for undergrad research?

I’m stressed all the time. I have no time ever. If I want to sleep, I feel guilty. I work on something everyday. I have no breaks. I can’t take a break. My GPA will tank. Grad school made me fat because I have no time to cook. I go almost the whole day without eating then binge convenient foods. I have now developed an eating disorder because I want the weight off, but have no time to cook let alone exercise. On the way home today the freeway closed and I was stuck for 4 hours. Hot, hungry, sleepy! The only time in my life where I really felt that I could shoot myself for real and be a splattered mess in gridlock traffic. \nI just feel ugly. I’m hungry. I’m tired. I’m sad. But I made a commitment to finish. I am going to finish. But I hate my life right now. I don’t even know the person I am right now. \nI’m not gonna fuckin kill myself, although it sounds so easy, but also just so boring to possibly be dead and alone. I just need the world to stop for a couple weeks. Or like, if I could go into that training world Goku and Gohan go to where they get all strong in a matter of days but they’ve actually been there for years.

        "text": "I’m in my second semester of my MS degree. I TAed for an introductory biology lab last semester and did well. My students did well in comparison to sections taught by other TAs and enjoyed the course (based on end-of-semester evaluations). This semester, I am teaching the same lab. I have one section full of awesome students. They ask questions, do their work, are respectful, are efficient, etc. The class average is currently a low B. I really couldn’t ask for a better class. My two sections last semester didn’t perform quite as well academically, but they were similar in terms of attitude and in-class behavior. I liked teaching them as well.\n\nMy other section this semester is quite honestly awful, and I can’t really figure out if it’s me, them, or both. It’s really stressing me out, and the course managers don’t seem concerned for some reason. The section is on Monday mornings and is mostly students repeating the course. One group has bad attitudes and rolls their eyes at everything I say, another has an avid cheater, a couple have such poor attendance that they can’t follow the material well, etc. Attendance overall is really bad. I expected some issues since it’s on Monday mornings, but I had 50% attendance last week. Around half of the class is currently failing because they don’t turn in their homework or show up. I am not sure what to do. I feel like I’m failing them somehow.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? It’s really getting me down. I don’t act any differently between the two sections, really. I may be slightly more serious and strict, but that’s only a result of the behavior differences between the two classes. I started off the same way in both sections and adjusted as needed.\n\nTo add to all of this, a student from the “bad” section is friends with a labmate of mine and effectively called me boring because I don’t allow students to leave early (it’s against course policies I didn’t write), am shy, and apparently seem like I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m not sure how much weight I should give this kind of feedback… The student never submits assignments and doesn’t do much in class. No notes, no lab work, etc. Maybe I just bore them all? \n\nI just don’t understand how there’s such a huge difference between this section and my others. I’m pretty confident that I deliver the material well, as I’ve gotten good feedback from evaluations by the course managers. I’m also the TA they send other TAs to observe if they miss a prep session. What I’m not confident about is how my personality comes across because I’m autistic and struggle with perceiving social stuff in the moment. I also don’t always have the right tone when I’m speaking. I only think about it all later when the anxiety kicks in. My other section responds well to my instruction, laughs at my jokes, makes jokes back, etc.\n\nShould I even be worried about all of this? Is the huge difference just because they’re all repeating on a Monday morning (the other section is all engineering majors taking the class for the first time)? Have any of you had a similar experience? I’m not really sure what I’m looking for by posting this. I’m just really disappointed by how things are going and would like to improve the situation if possible",

        "text": "I am a graduate assistant for my school. I haven't began any work for the position yet because of bureaucratic delays for the project. However, the position is already creating obstacles in my ability to pursue other work on top.\n\nIn my original contract, it simply said I needed permission to do off-campus employment, but I would do 20-hours a week for my assistantship. At the time, I accepted- about a month ago. \n\nI now have an internship opportunity that is 20 hours a week. As according to my university contract, I asked for permission as appropriate and was approved. Then I accepted my internship. However, my university then came to me with some random form that now says all students employed by the university work 20hours for the university, and can only work 10 hours maximum (total of 30 hours a week) outside of the university. This is a new stipulation that was not communicated to be so I'm very sour. Of course it affects me accepting the assistantship, which was more for money than experience while my internship is for experience. \n\nI contested, but the university just kept saying they cannot change policy, do anything about it, and that there's no one further I could talk to (I talked to a dean, hr). They kind of screwed me over last minute in terms of not allowing me to make an informed decision, as well as falsely giving me approval for my internship.\n\nI am wondering if I should just lie and do my internship without telling them the fact that I'm doing 20 hours instead of 10 hours. I don't like lying and it makes me nervous, but I'm pretty pissed that they have a blanket policy that wants to keep me poor. If they found out, I don't know what the worst they would do really is. I'm not afraid of losing my assistantship. But it paid for two courses adding up to maybe $5000-6000, so if I think about it from a cost benefit perspective the few hundred I would earn from 10 hours of extra work is ultimately less. They ask for my internship supervisor but I just don't think they will check",

I’m getting a PhD in neural engineering, studying stimulation of the nervous system for therapeutic effect. \n\nMy two options are: \n\nA internationally renowned university on the opposite side of the country from my family, who I am very close to. \nI currently work at this university with the lab where I would do my studies. The PI and other staff are all great to work with. I know that I could get along for 5+ years. The lab is larger with several post docs and supporting staff. The PI is at full stride in their career, with a stellar record for placing students post graduation and great influence in the field. The lifestyle of the area is ok. Not really what I’m into, but not bad. The project would allow me to build a great number of skills across the field, but I don’t feel it has a big impact as far as the patients it serves or the improvements to technology. \n\nThe other option is a research 1 uni still, but it is a less known state school. This university is in the mountains, on the same side of the country as my family. The mountains and outdoor areas near by make the lifestyle ideal for me. The lab I’m interested in is very new. They have only one graduate, and that happened this year. The PI is young, and excited; but I have heard that they are not the best at listening, empathizing or supporting students when they are lost. The science that the lab is working on is revolutionary in my opinion. The impact is huge and that makes me really excited and motivated. This lab is small, so I would be responsible for more support/admin on my own projects. I would get to develop a wide range of technical skills, but there are some I may miss compared to the other option. \n\nSo, basically my choice is between: prestige and PI or lifestyle/geography and project. \n\nI think I’d like to pursue an academic career at a teaching university (70-30 teaching) or just teach in the future. \n\nOpinions, advice and perspective appreciated.",

Or do I say no, interview for UF, and risk it because I don't know if I would get in or not? \n\nI'd really appreciate any advice you guys have on this, especially in terms of factors I should consider. I'm going to look into assistantships and rent for sure to account for financial aspects, but then there's also the distance vs closeness to home factor. Thanks in advance guys!",

I don’t want to switch jobs because my employer offers fantastic student benefits, I love the job I’m doing, and it relates to the job I ultimately hope to have after graduation (likely with the same employer too). Going part time at work isn’t an option for financial reasons. I’m more than halfway through school and overall have been doing well with both work and school. \n\nBut, I struggle with being tired all the time. Waking up early, doing a full day at work, going home - sometimes running errands, sometimes studying/doing assignments, whatever needs to get done. Luckily I do have some free time and generally a good work/life balance. The issue is usually by the time I reach the “free time” I’m often too tired to really enjoy myself, and sometimes too tired to do much of anything at all.\n\nI did see a doctor just in case, she ruled out anything serious (besides some minor vitamin deficiencies which I’m now supplementing for). I’m highly sure this is from “working” so many hours. If you count both work and school as “work” I probably work 48-50 hours most weeks. I feel like I’d be mostly fine if I worked 40 hours or less, but as I said before, it’s not really an option… trying to hang in there until I graduate.\n\nLooking for any advice!\n\nFor context: no kids, live with boyfriend (who also works a full-time job - and often also longer than 40 hours worth).",

Also, most of the relevant conferences I attend don't often meet in the summer. My college consistently sends out emails about summer fellowships, programs, internships looking for psych grad students. **However, I missed most if not all of the deadlines for summer programs of interest due to them falling around a major surgery I had**.

I'm worried I missed yet another opportunity to get involved in the summer. \n\nI don't even know how important it is for me to find summer opportunities given I don't have to worry about summer funding. **How important is it to get involved in summer activities if I am fully funded for the summer?

        "text": "Since spring break is next week and I wanted to wrap things up and try to enjoy the time off, I handed in one of my assignments a few days early, since I was already finished with it.\n\nA few hours later, I got an email from my professor saying he took a glance at my work and thought that one of my responses was too sparse and needed more info.\n\nHe then said he was \"confused\" by why I gave a poor answer, because according to him, he thinks I understand the material really well, that I'm \"one of the few\" that seems on top of things? Welp, apparently not, since I honestly thought I had the right answer and I guess I'm not even close. I don't even know where to begin to do it correctly, to be honest. He ended by saying he's not trying to \"bash\" me, but he just doesn't know what to think about the fact that I, of all people (that he has known for... Seven weeks lol), would give a bad answer to a question.\n\nI guess I kinda just don't really know how to react. It feels borderline inappropriate to say something like that, like \"how are YOU screwing this up?\" I dunno man, I guess I'm just actually a dumbass? Lol? I mean I guess I'm grateful that he is giving me this chance to fix it, but also, now I feel this weird pressure to be one of his best students. This is a class where a lot of us are struggling, and the professor is honestly kind of struggling also (he's quite young, younger than me lol, and I'm not sure if he's ever even taught a class before). I'm only a few months from graduation myself, so honestly I'm content to just go down with the ship, let that shit sink, and if I'm apparently his smart student and even I am screwing things up, maybe that's a wake up call for the rest of the class?\n\nI'm also just freaked out, pretty much exactly how you'd expect to feel if you felt like you made a good effort on something, and the person evaluating your work says \"wow, yeah, not even close.\" It's disheartening and disappointing.",

        "text": "**Context:** \n\nI'm currently a third-year student at a T30 undergrad on a full merit scholarship. I'm a Neuroscience (BS) and Economics (BA) double degree candidate; I have two years left to complete my degrees (graduating in 5 years total), and I'm writing Honors theses in both majors. \n\nLast May, I sustained a significant brain injury that I still haven't fully recovered from. Last fall, I took the minimum credit requirement (1 class) to maintain housing while recovering. Because I've also been a primary caregiver for a severely ill parent all three years, there have been multiple semesters during which I've had to take less than the normal credit load, and it has impacted my GPA significantly. Needless to say, my transcript looks strange, though the grades are decent. I have little to no research experience under a professor or PI; I have presented at an undergraduate conference. \n\n**Now the question:**\n\nI'm able to take a year off of school (Fall 2023-Summer 2024) to:\n\na) recover fully from my brain injury,  \nb) dedicate more time to taking care of my ailing parent (with whom I'm not sure how much time I have left), and  \nc) work full-time.\n\nI have part-time co-op/internship offers from a few well-known research institutions and firms. I can take up to three of these offers (they are in different timeframes over the next year and/or they are half-time).\n\n**Is it worth extending my graduation date by another year so that I can take a year off of school? How bad does it look to top grad programs (in any field) to graduate in six years, even if only five of them were spent in school?**",

        "text": "Hi all. I’m a PhD student in my first year and currently in distress. I got my bachelors and masters from reputable institutions and got into yet another reputable institution for my PhD program. My advisor is a hot shot and really is one of the few people doing good research in my field. However, even though I have cleared my qualifiers before time, I’m thinking of mastering out. \n\nMy advisor in very insensitive and it has made me extremely unhappy. I fell very demotivated and feel like I have no technical understanding of what’s happening - bringing down the name of the reputable institutions I’ve studied from. He puts a lot of pressure on me and will try to blame me for very little things such as emails. \n\nPhD had been a long term career goal for me. But now, I feel like mastering out would be better for my mental health since I don’t think I can cross the finish line with him. I’ll have to fight my ego however because I’m the sort of person who doesn’t give up. I’ll always feel down seeing other people get their PhD’s. I had a 4.0 in my masters and have publications from my thesis too. But that was very seamless as compared to what I’m facing now. \n\nHow do I fight that ego of mine if I decide to leave the program?\n\nPS. Switching advisors is not an option since I came to this institution for him and my research is very particular, and so is done by very limited people on the country. I’m not at all attracted to research done by other professors and feel like switching my field would put me in the same situation.",
