The project will conclude it a presentation to a general (not necessarily mathematically inclined) audience in a symposium. Here's the abstract:\n\n&gt; Mathematicians have been interested in the sums of the first ùëõ powers since antiquity. Many ancient cultures had useful formulae for the sums of the first ùëõ natural numbers, squares, and cubes. The monumental discovery of a general formula for the sum of any power in terms of the Bernoulli numbers shocked the mathematical community in the 17th century. Recently, the method of generating functions has proven an effective direct approach to studying these sums. A more general problem is the sum of powers of an arbitrary arithmetic sequence, such as the odd numbers or the numbers counting by four. We adapt the method of generating functions to this larger problem of sums of powers of an arithmetic sequence. The generating function for these sums gives rise to a functional equation. Solutions to this equation are obtained in the form of recurrence relations and, eventually, an explicit formula.\n\nI tried to keep it mostly accessible and include some history to make it a bit more enticing to someone with no math background. If anyone has any feedback it would be very, very appreciated!",

How can a probability be greater than 1? I observed this happening for other values of x which were very close to the mean, within 1 standard deviation, and some of those probabilities were also greater than 1. Since the CDF of the distribution is 1, how can a singular probability be greater than the sum of all other probabilities?\n\nHave I done something wrong, or is this a statistical limitation to the normal distribution?",

Player A draws 0.23, 0.5 -&gt; 0.73. Since his cumulative sum is now over X, he draws a final time (0.8) and finishes with a score of 1.53. Player B draws 0.56 and 0.7 -&gt; 1.36.

My current career isn't really super quantitative, and as a result, my previous math knowledge has largely evaporated.\n\nIn other words, before even attempting to learn material beyond Calc 1, I would need a serious and thorough refresher of all the material I had previously learned in high school (plus a few stats courses I took in undergrad).  To cut to the chase: does this strike anyone here as the least bit realistic or possible?  Is it possible to learn new things after 30, or has my aged brain become too ossified to incorporate new information?\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice anyone could offer.",

Anyone who is familiar with the aptitude test knows how easy it is.) Basically maybe like Algebra 1.\n\nI currently plan on serving 4 years to get the GI Bill then after go to school for a bachelor's in nuclear engineering.\n\nAs far as I know, universities have entrance exams or something to get in, right? And the engineering programs I've looked at all begin with Calculus.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWould it be worthwhile to get an associate's online while I serve to be ready for engineering? \n\n(I mean as far as being proficient in the mathematics is concerned. Mathematics has always been my weakest subject and I wish to improve. Structured coursework of reptitions seems really useful to do so.)",

        "text": "My questions:\n\nI will start doing a PhD in Operations Research/Industrial Engineering.\n\n1. For passing the qualification exam, and doing research in IEOR but not math, is it worth it to learn the measure-based stochastic processes?\n2. I know very little about measure-based stochastic processes, and don't feel confident in the elementary ones (some problem solving techniques I've seen are just tricky). If I want to spend some leisure time getting prepared for my PhD by learning/reviewing some related contents, is it a good idea to use Ross's *Introduction to Probability Models*?\n\nMy background:\n\nI know measure theory, and some basic probability stuff based on measure, like R-N derivative, conditional expectations, martingales, Central Limit Theorem, Laws of Larger Numbers. \n\nI know nothing about Brownian Motions (It was the subject of the last lecture of a course I took but was not covered in the final exam, so I just ignored it). I know a bit about Markov Kernels and things like Strong Markov Property stated in a way using left-shifting operators, but nothing about trajectories and the related probability space.\n\nMy feeling about Markov Chains:\n\nAnalysis explains Calculus and I like analysis. However, unlike Analysis vs Calculus, with Markov Chains I feel many things authors do in an elementary textbook (e.g.,  the way they state the Markov Properties, and the way they use them to justify some equations in their proofs) are very hard (at least for someone only knowing Markov Kernels and Markov Properties) to explain using the language of the measure-theory-based Markov Chains. I feel really uncomfortable about this. \n\nIf someone could give any suggestions that would be great. Appreciate any help, and thank you for reading all this!!",
