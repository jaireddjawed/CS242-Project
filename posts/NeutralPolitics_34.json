Mueller III is hiring a 16th member of the independent [Special Counsel investigation team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Counsel_investigation).\n\nMueller was [appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html).\n\nBut is that really where the influence ends? Who decides how much budget he has? Can Rosenstein or anyone else influence the investigation by limiting the budget or vetoing staff hires? Or by other means like imposing an unrealistic timeline? \n\nHow often and to whom does he have to report to make sure he's using the funds appropriately and is this an area for potential influence?\n\nDoes such a line of reporting and oversight mean someone like Rosenstein is actually privy to what Mueller has found so far and what he's planning?\n\nUltimately what's the effect on the independence of the investigation?\n\nEdit: The practical questions are answered in the comments. The question remains as to how much influence this permits. Theoretically it's a lot, and it's not clear how Rosenstein's decision making can be challenged. Sessions can't, Trump won't. We're relying on Rosenstein's personal ethics (which seem to be holding up). In practice I hope that if Mueller feels he can't do a proper job he'd go public. Any thoughts? ",

Usually, drugs are not a cause for a state of emergency. Looking back in history, for biological reasons, it has been diseases that have caused states of emergency:\n\n&gt; It is not often that a public health emergency is declared for something other than a natural disaster. The US Department of Health and Human Services declared one in Puerto Rico last year after more than 10,000 Zika cases were reported there. Before that, the last emergency declaration, unrelated to a natural disaster, was during the 2009-10 flu season, when there was widespread concern over a potential pandemic.\n\n[source](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/31/health/opioid-commission-emergency-declaration/index.html)\n\nFrom within the same source, it is stated:\n&gt; \"Your declaration would empower your cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the Executive Branch even further to deal with this loss of life,\"\n\nBut what else is a government supposed to do for a state of emergency?  It seems that it usually gives authorities more power, allows a rapid passing of laws, provide aid or equipment, and financial help, but these are usually for natural disasters.\n\n[source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/07/what-is-a-state-of-emergency-and-which-governments-have-declared-one/)\n\n[source](http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/)\n\nThe first source states that the commission wants: \n&gt; [T]o rapidly increase treatment capacity for those who need substance abuse help; to establish and fund better access to medication-assisted treatment programs; and to make sure that health care providers are aware of the potential for misuse and abuse of prescription opioids by enhancing prevention efforts at medical and dental schools.\n\nBut should that be on the federal level or on the state level?\n\nAre there other cases of a drug triggering a state of emergency either in the USA or in another country? If so, how was it handled? Was it effective?\n\n",

        "text": "There has been a wave of campus carry bills in the US: laws allowing or requiring public universities to permit students to concealed carry weapons on campus, subject to the existing state requirements such as permitting if any. Recent states passing such legislation include [Arkansas](http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/2017R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=hb1249), [Georgia](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20172018/170679.pdf) (PDF warning), [Texas](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&amp;Bill=SB11), and [Kansas](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/measures/documents/hb2113_00_0000.pdf).\n\nObviously it's too soon to know the effects that these laws have had in their states; some haven't even taken effect yet.\n\nBut there are other states that have allowed campus carry for longer. If you are looking for an overview of the current situation,\n [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_carry_in_the_United_States) has a nice map of campus carry laws.\n\nBy my count, 10 states allow it, 20 states and DC ban it, and the rest allow institutions to decide.\n\nHas there been any research into the effects of existing campus carry states one way or the other? I have seen many opinion pieces on the subject, but have not had any luck finding concrete numbers.\n\nSome specific questions I have in mind, in states that have existing campus carry, since it was instituted:\n\n* Is there any sense of how common legal campus carriers are on campuses where it's permitted?\n\n* Have there been any studies or reports showing trends of increased/decreased gun injuries/deaths on campus?\n\n* Have there been any studies or reports showing trends of increased/decreased defensive gun usage on campus?\n\n* Have there been any studies or reports showing changing crime rates on campus (up or down) that can be linked to these policies one way or the other?\n\nSince private universities are generally (always?) not covered by these laws (at least based on my reading of the ones linked above), and there are states where individual universities can decide for themselves, I feel like it could even be possible to compare within states. Of course, there are many variables to consider beyond just campus carry(yes) or campus carry(no).",

The Medicaid website ( https://www.medicaid.gov/chip/financing/index.html) seems to state that the program's funding is, at least in part, determined by a percentage of Medicaid funding. It also appears that CHIP can operate as a separate program or as an extension of Medicaid depending on the state (we are in PA if that changes anything).\n\nMy questions are: if Medicaid funding is decreased, will that in turn decrease the amount of funding available for children in the CHIP program? If so, have any legislators discussed this and possible amendments to protect children's coverage? Have their been any discussions on the economic impacts to such an outcome?\n\nAdditionally any links to further reading or information would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you r/neutralpolitics",
