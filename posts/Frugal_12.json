But there is one thing that I terribly miss: eating/being out with friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to go out with friends every Saturday. In our city, we tried a different restaurants, bars, pizzerias, etc. every week, so that we could taste any food. Then we usually went for a walk, until evening. The average expense, if it was a lunch, was around 20 euros, while if it was a sweet, pizza, street food, around 5 euros. So, let's say that on average I was spending like 50 euros a month.\n\nI really miss this aspect of my life! On the other hand, it's true that I manage to save money but how can I understand whether I to consider this a \"lifestyle\" inflation thing? How do I recognize this to be bad or beneficial?\n\nAfter all I was with friends which was the thing I liked the most!

        "text": "Something I just learned recently.  I got one of those cheaper $50 Vornado fans as a gift from a family member about 7 years ago.  It's broken down to a point where it won't \"spin up\" and I couldn't be arsed to take the thing apart and WD-40 it or whatever.\n\nSo I e-mailed Vornado about it, asking them what my options are.  Took a couple days to respond, but the person on the other end told me Vornado has a \"trade in\" program that isn't even a trade-in program.  It kinda works on the honor system even.\n\nBasically, after giving them the info on the bottom of the Vornado and taking a picture of said info and sending it to their e-mail, they will then request for you to cut off the power cord maybe about 3-4 inches from the base of the fan.  Show the cut power cord in another picture *with Vornado and the serial and model number showing* and send the picture to them.\n\nThey will send you back a coupon code you can use for 30% off any fan in their online store + free shipping.  Free shipping alone will save you a few bucks, but the 30% will have a bigger impact on a higher quality Vornado fan you can buy that will last you longer.  There are still Vornados made/assembled in the US (they have a filter for it on the site) you can choose from.\n\nThey will then ask you to dispose of the fan.  This is when you either take it to your local Best Buy for recycling or a local electronics recycling shop/center - that will be on you to Google.",

In the last year or so though I've always had a running list of major purchases or non frugal things I wanted that I would request and I've gotten a lot of really amazing and useful gifts, like\n\n\\- A bundle of specialty coffees because I love trying new kinds of coffee but can't justify the price\n\n\\- New tablet (was a joint purchase of my family)\n\n\\- Asked for a few fancy spices because I wanted to experiment a little - my aunt took me out to shop at a spice bar which was amazing!!\n\n\\- A set of shower gel, body scrub and body lotion from a fancy brand I've wanted to get for a while but always balked at the price\n\n\\- gift card for a hotel my partner and I wanted to stay at for a little mountain vacation\n\nObviously consider the budget of the other person and any inconvenience like having to drive to a particular storee etc! I don't mean to recommend asking people for huge gifts or anything but if they are asking you what you would like, this basically means they buy something that you actually wanted and will be used, which is nice and less stress for the gift giver, better for the environment and good for you wallet :)",

        "text": "So for some background information I just moved into this student housing place beginning of january. I moved in with 2 room mates who both don't have jobs so they don't have to go out and work. They do their laundry once every 2-3 weeks. \n\nI work at starbucks and bike 2 hours every day in order to get to and from work. I do my laundry twice a week. and I only wash my work clothes. I don't even wash my casual clothes or towels often. I've come from a household and background where I never even had an in unit laundry unit in my own apartment or house. Other places I rented never even included that. I'm not sure if it's my fault why the electricity bill spiked 3x the normal amount within the first month I moved in here. but at the same time there have been some talk in my city that electricity rates are increasing but i'm not sure if it would be a considerable amount.\n\nMy room mate's solution was to \"buy more clothes\" for every day I work and cut down to laundry once a week. Even though I already have too much clothes but they're not within dress code. Currently I have 3 outfits. I sometimes wear the same outfit twice as is even though by the second day it smells like sweat. Every day I walk into work my clothes are already covered in sweat. I try not to wear clothes that I would need to change out of once I get to work since that would only increase the laundry load. I would work 5-6 days a week. My aprons is a must and I have 5 aprons which is a load on their own. I'm just not sure what a possible solution would be here. They're apparently on a strict budget since their income comes from parents. I work for my mine so this isn't an issue for me but it's a big issue for them. Any advice would be appreciated.",

Looking for some input on some more experienced frugalists(?)\n\nRecently moved from an older 1310 SqFt  3bd 2bth apartment to a newer 1245 SqFt 3bd 2bth apartment with ceilings that are damn near 3 feet taller. \n\nJust got our first electric bill for this first place and it was $186. Average at our old place was between $50-$100 a month.\n\nDifferences:\n\n\\- New place has taller ceilings\n\n\\- New place is on the 1st floor\n\n\\- New place has an in-unit washer and dryer as well as a standalone water heater for our unit.\n\nFor the details, average KwH at the old place was anywhere between 400-800 depending on the month. This statement for the new place was 1616 KwH!\n\nNot sure about my washer/dryer, but for reference the water heater is 4825 average KwH a year, averaging out to 402 a year. \n\nMy questions are, is this spike in monthly bill normal for the additional appliances that we have now? If so, gimme some good frugal ways for us to keep the cost down as much as we can please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all!",
