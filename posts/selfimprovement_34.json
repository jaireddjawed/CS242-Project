        "text": "I need some advice. I’m a 22 year old female from New York who’s been out of school for almost a year now (graduated with a BA in psychology last May). I decided to take a gap year to mainly try to figure out what to do next but so far I haven’t made any real progress. I still feel unsure about my future and I’m starting to feel more depressed about my life and the choices I’ve made. Everyone that knows me says I’m doing great but I feel horrible about where I am in life right now. I feel like maybe moving to a different state and starting fresh might be good for me but I’m not sure. I have a decent paying job that I like and a complicated but good relationship that I’ve invest a lot into so I’m scared to walk away with no real plan about how to maneuver those things but I think what I’m doing right now isn’t working for me. What should I do? Any and EVERY advice will be greatly appreciated",

        "text": "So yeah, I set the settings of the game to nightmare mode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started the journey of self improvement when I was like 18-20 years old, obviously I made a lot of mistakes but the mindset was always there, I managed to finish two careers in university (European degrees, 240 credits), got in a good shape, learn English to a really high level (but I still think I suck writing it). Also managed to have a long lasting relationship (I'm single now) and I learnt a lot of stuff in the process.\n\nIn early 2021 I fell into a really huge depression due to a series of unfortunate events that damaged me deeply. I needed almost two whole years to recover and I spent a lot of time and resources visiting therapists, doctors... It was worth it but I got lost during the process.\n\nIt's not like I stopped my life completely but my mental health didn't allow me to do so much, my main task everyday was to survive without going completely insane, this resulted on me not putting effort or time into improving myself or progressing into the stuff I want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm recovered and I feel more powerful than ever, even considering I'm lacking on some skills or habits. Good thing is that almost everything I'm missing is my responsability and I can take action to change it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.-Fitness? done, it's gonna be a while until I'll be able to squat 100kg as I used to, but I'm going to the gym 3-4 days a week already.\n\n2.-Healthy diet? I've always know how to cook, also my roomate is an incredible chef and is always advicing me.\n\n3.-Money? Getting there, I'm not doing bad but I will progress in my job if I keep putting effort. \n\n4.-Hobbys? Well, my biggest hobby is music and I already joined a local band. I'm not the best musician but I'm practising consistently right now. I'm good enough to play the lead guitar anyways. I want to start hiking again.\n\n5.-Social life? Not too much, my roomates are delightful guys but I don't vibe a lot with their friends, we went out together a couple of times but didn't quite fit. Also they have really unealthy habits.\n\n6.-Dating? I've dated a girl already but didn't work. I'm not doing any good with women despite generating attraction, women have approached me recently but I suck at flirting rigth now and I don't have the chance of meeting many women.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The thing is that I know it's hard to get a social circle when you are my age, but I feel like I'm missing something here, I don't have the chance to meet new people at work and also my coworkers are people of different age, I can get along with them but it's not the same you know. I don't like team sports and I'm into a healthy lifestyle so there are a lot of activities out of the question for me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I would love any advice from you guys, even if it's a link to another subreddit that could help me or a little hint over there. I think and feel like I'm \"good enough\" to get out there and get some friends, some dates... but starting it's never easy. I am patient with this but I should work on it too.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: 28 years old male living in a new country, almost everything kind of works for me so far but I have a really weak social/dating life right now, I'd like to hear your experiences and advices to improve in this subjects.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw, if you think it's relevant, I should say that I'm living in Canada.",

        "text": "When I was at uni I fell out with one of my main friendship groups right before I left. One person I actively decided to step away from because I realised she was closer to a bully than a friend, which creates a domino effect of me being distanced from the rest of the group. This really hurt. \n\nI stayed friends with one of them for a while as he was in my city but recently learned he’s talked a lot of shit about me so I ghosted him. I knew a conversation would go nowhere and I had nothing to say. \n\nSince then, I’ve moved cities (not related to the fallout I just got a job after uni) I have a long term wonderful boyfriend, I’ve made a couple new really wonderful friends plus having older really great friends. On the surface there is no reason I should care about any of that stuff. The trash literally took itself out of my life. My struggle is the lack of closure, there was never an official conversation about why we’re no longer friends - stuff just happened and then we stopped talking. \n\nI still find myself watching their stories seeing them live their lives and feel weird about it. Angry at how they treated me, sad that the friendship is over, grateful I don’t have to deal with their endless drama and bitchiness. I made other really amazing friends from uni but im jealous of people who had huge friendship groups that all seemed really genuine and kind.\n\nI’ve thought about unfollowing them all off social media but don’t want to cause drama because they all have those apps that tell you who’s unfollowed you. \n\nAnyone who’s experience something similar and got over it- please spill your secrets",

        "text": "I keep getting told during arguments recently with my guy that I don't do anything for our relationship except a couple things. We are both 41, been together for 2.5 years. He is independently wealthy so he doesn't work (doesnt intend to, which is of course the opposite of what he claimed when we met, or I'd have been disinterested), I have 2 jobs and almost always have worked 50/60+ hour weeks. He pays for most things when we go out together, but not all. I own my own home (we don't live together) and I have never had financial help with anything in my life, I've just worked to get what I needed/wanted. I've never once been told I don't do enough in any relationship until these past few months. Is it wrong to think he has unlimited free time so most of the \"stuff\" should be his doing? I work long hours with two jobs to provide well for myself and my two dogs, I don't always have time to shovel snow or run an errand or two, so he helps with those things MAYBE once a month and he asked me repeatedly \"what do you do for me?!\" My gut says that's an insane question but years of emotional distress tells me maybe I should be doing more for him/us?",

And I see them playing the shows I wish I was playing. And while I am happy for them and I know they worked hard on their music and the members were in older bands so they already have the connections so it just makes sense that they can do better faster.\n\nBut deep down I feel jealous. I wish it was me. But I don’t want to feel that way. And I know what y’all say “work on new music” and we are. We’re about to release a two song single and ep soon. But it still makes feel even shittier because everything just feels dependent on the world’s validation. I think what might help is just staying off of social media like instagram or tik tok and not seeing the validation so I can stay grounded and humble and not have higher expectations. Just stay in view of what’s in front of me and practice being understanding and happy for others success. \n\nHaha writing this made me feel better. I think I’m moving in the right direction. I can be a better human.",

        "text": "I'm currently embarking on a journey of self-improvement after a bad breakup almost 4 months ago now that made me question every aspect of my life and who I was as a person. The conclusion I came to was that I needed to focus on my life and improve it for myself, and that eventually the right person would come along. And so far, I really have been sticking to it - I've become more disciplined - getting up at 6am, focusing on my job, my master's thesis, reading, and my hobbies. I've recently joined my local gym and if all goes to plan I'll be having my first workout session there tomorrow. Overall, even though my life was shattered and turned upside down when the person I thought I'd marry left me, I'm doing a lot better now - and even a lot better than how I was before that relationship, when I was legitimately suicidally depressed, only eating say, a chocolate bar every week or so for example. Because my long-term partner bailed on me just as we were about to start renting a place in the city where all my friends are, I haven't been able to do that, because as it stands I can't afford a place there alone. So for the time being, I'm stuck in a fairly small, run-down town about an hour and a half from there. It's going to take me a while to save up enough money to be able to rent a place there comfortably for a long enough time to find a well-paying job, so it looks like I'll be stuck here for a while. Months, at least. If not years. Which sucks as I have no friends here, and there aren't really any communities catering to those with my interests where I live, so meeting like-minded people will be very difficult if not impossible. It's one of those places where you just feel extremely isolated. \n\nBecause of this, and because just in general I wanted to, I have made an extra effort to connect and reconnect with my friends in the city. But through that it's just become painfully apparent that there's something about me that people are... adverse to. It's probably stupid, because it is mostly just little things. But little things do add up and make me wonder if people do genuinely like me and value my company. For the most part, it's things like not replying to what I say when we all call in a group, not laughing or engaging with my jokes (I mean, I'm not the funniest person in the world, granted. But I'm not devoid of good jokes), not replying to my messages in our group chats even when I offer to make art of their D&amp;D characters for free, that sort of thing. Again, I know they're stupid little things and I feel quite immature because of it. Like, why should these things get to me? But they do. Especially when others in the friend group get the attention that I'd also like. I suppose in part, the breakup with my ex has had me reevaluating my ability to connect with other people. My ex said that I was \"hard to be around\". And that really got to me. I mean, if the person who knew the most about me, was closest to me and supposedly loved me the most thought that about me, what must everyone else think? Granted, sometimes I am quiet, probably painfully so. But I do try. It's just that in a lot of situations, I have no idea what to say. I can be witty with my family or with people who I've known for decades, but even with my closest friends I can't really pull that charismatic wittiness off. I'm quiet for long periods of time when my friends are talking to each other because I'm genuinely trying to think of what to say, or how I can add to the conversation in any meaningful way. Maybe some of that comes from confidence issues - I don't want to end up offending people if I don't have to, and I'm not sure if the things I *do* think to say will be recieved well a lot of the time. Not that they're anything bad perse, it's just that a lot of jokes and witty comments have a layer of risque to them, I guess. That could be why, and if so, how should I go about againing confidence in this area, and moreso, how do I just know what to say? \n\nThen again, other people in the group speak just as little if not less than me, and they're generally treated with more warmth and enthusiasm, which makes me think that it could be something else. It often feels like there's some sort of aura around me that emits something that just makes people not eager to associate with me. But I couldn't even begin to determine what this other thing could be. \n\nI hope I don't seem like some chronic overthinker or something, but I do wonder sometimes about how likeable I am in general. This is an area I do want to improve in, as well as all the others.",

And I think, a lot of people, who struggle getting their life together, have this issue.\n\nOver the years, I developed an incredible elaborate mental system to avoid confronting myself with reality. This even involves creating new problems, which seem more urgent, than the real ones, but really aren't! On to this, I often seem to live under the illusion, that the best part of life is yet to come. But I'm in my mid-twenties now and I realize, that this is simply not going to happen anymore unless I invest more time and energy, than I have done up till now! \n\nEspecially nowadays, it's so easy to distract yourself and once you are on a habit of running from your problems, you will do it in every area of your life, whcih can have of course serious longterm consequences. In order to change, you first have to become aware of that! Usually, life will take care of that sooner or later, but then it's often to your own big disadvantage! \n\nWell, as a new years resolution, I told myself, I need to stop doing that and confronting myself from now on with the truth head-on! Journaling is of course a great way to keep track of your life and see, what really happened in your life over the course of longer time period!",

        "text": " \n\n**How your smile boosts your thoughts and organs to a better place?**\n\nSmile Always the cure for hard time, as it enrichs lives to sustain any life challenges, and critical circumstances which most of us face with different severities.\n\nSmile is vital for mind and body, as people who smile have gratitude to accept, and transform negative thoughts and struggles to big push forward to elevate.\n\nSmiling boost face muscles and stimulate other organs efficiently which tends to the peace of mind state, hence good and creative thoughts, and it also boosts other organs functionality from 15% to 30% than the usual state.\n\n**How your important to stimulate dopamine and serotonin?**  \n\nthe most important hormones after the growth hormones are the hormones which are boosted because of happiness, the most important 2 are dopamine and serotonin.\n\nYou can boost both hormones by physical activities like; running, sexual intercourse, or enjoying your favorite hobbies like; drawing, writing, reading, watching your favorite show, or even driving.\n\nIt’s essential daily to find a way or another to go for any of the above for 30 minutes in order to stimulate these hormones regardless your current events or circumstances, these 30 minutes are what we call \"me time.\"\n\nI know that life is so dynamic and costly but not all the activities will cost you that much, I know that most of us take long time to offer food on table for his/her family, and most of their times fade out through their commitments, but believe it or not if you insist on your daily healthy patterns the universe will obey.\n\n**How our smile overcome any inner or outer rage, and hate along our way?**\n\nAlways the smile transforms your norms and patterns even if you have inner battles and it fades out your current struggles, rage, and hate delivered by life challenges, family issues, or workplace it could be the solution even momentarily to restructure your mind and thoughts.\n\nNo one has talent or even excel anything in good manners like a professional won’t start or in initiate anything at his/her peaks, as what differs him/her from others is the quality of their outcome, so it’s vital to find time, and place for your “me time.”\n\nInner rage: are thoughts and battles which no one feels or knows instead of you, and 80% of these thoughts are invalid and spreading because you didn’t give yourself a chance to hold on, and restructure your mind without calling any negative triggers.\n\nOuter rage: is a pit more real rage, hate, or aggression which delivered by the surrounding toxic environments, and communities because of your improper way or envy and aggression by others which you can't control.\n\nMany people can’t regain their guts and momentum without going to extremes like smoking or drinking or even going for bizarre things.\n\nHowever, the best cure is to practice gratitude and smile than trying to go for any other exaggerated activities to regain your happiness.\n\n**Why hater, low standard individuals, and aggressors seek to rape your happiness and positive vibes?**\n\nIf you choose to be a doer or change maker who add value it won’t be easy at all, you should expect being humiliated, and drained most of the time with many time wasters across your way.\n\nTo be from the 1% you should accept many sacrifices at your end, and being the black swan most of the time, to elevate regardless your low resources or status.\n\nIt’s better to have all your silver bullets ready, and many contingency plans along your way, because the majority of the people won’t accept your change, and will try to tackle every now and then, and it’s our human nature and you are not alone.\n\nThe aggressors, haters, low standards are all under the umbrella of limiting believers, not all their confusions or reasons are real.\n\n**Here are some major reasons:**\n\n* May be the can’t do what you are doing, hence can’t see your painted pictures or your aims.\n*  Maybe they envy what you really stand for or at, and can’t see any better version of you.\n* Maybe they seek attention or obsessed by being your pain in neck and your time wasters for their fame.\n* Maybe they feel secure by invading your security, life, and your peace mind for their good by stealing your vibes, and outsmart you.\n\nFinally, the best resolution is to analyze and track similar events and keep moving forward to your pre-established with the required milestones to reach your big aims, and don’t give any room for negativity throughout your way.\n\n**How to tackle toxic people like a monk?** \n\nYou can’t stop the Toxic people existence but you can mitigate their effect by transforming their mindset but you can’t control their inner preferences or feelings.\n\nIf you need to pass by their hard times, and confusions you should understand and analyze the reasons beyond either the real or the vague ones at that point you will be able to know their irrational fears to use it for your own favor and build to them a vortex every time they try to deliver any negative triggers to your comfort zone without even attending.\n\nDiscussion is good only for mature, stable, and respectful people, because toxic people have one real reason and hundreds of fake ones with all the rumors per each along.\n\nIf you are willing to hear constructive feedback for your reference it will never happen, as the conversation won’t be win/win one it always tends to lose/win, beside the time you will consume which will be your next loss.\n\nMy advice to be sharp and firm specially while dealing with any slackers who master delivering fake sugar coated words, and promises.\n\nFinally, they fear many things at your case, so once they started draining you, so it is the best time to use these things on them without letting them notice.\n\n**How manifestation and meditation help you to regain your momentum and peace of mind?**\n\nEach one of us has his/her own mind blowers which we live with daily and it consume a big portion of our brain backyard and lead to many urges.\n\nSo it’s vital to have time to release all negative triggers by finding a suitable place without distraction without giving any room to interact with anyone or calling any good or bad thoughts.\n\nAnd connect with nature, your body, and manifest all your dreams, and use positive affirmations it could really help to restructure your thoughts and mind.\n\n**Here are some tips for yoga or meditation:**\n\nEnsure your hydration, and all your intakes are in place and you feel no hunger or thirst.\n\nEnsure you have slept well and avoid recalling any thoughts unless you recall it.\n\nTry to release any rage or hate and enjoy the power of gratitude even for little things, you can increase your gratitude level by prayers or what make you happy to reach the calm state of mind with no rebounds.\n\nFinally think clearly for each problem you are facing as a third party don’t have any problems, then look deep down to what want to gain, lose, want, and reject to pass by and overcome like a monk. ",

        "text": "Hi guys! I have this issue that I wanted to talk to a therapist about, but first I wanted to see what reddit has to say. When it comes to women, I am often thinking about relationships and hookups, but I don't want that. For example, everytime I meet a new girl I either think, \"Would she want to be my girlfriend?\" or \"Should I try to get with her?\" and I don't want that. I want to have friendships without the constant thought of further pursuit. I am not desperate for a relationship or hookup, but I am just constantly thinking about it. I just think I am objectifying women too much and I don't feel good about it. Let me know if you have any advice. Thanks.",

I was telling my clients many of the things in the list below...\n\n* Meditation.\n* Cold showers.\n* Wrote down my goals.\n* Visualisation.\n* And so on.\n\nNone of it really *worked* for me, and none of it truly was working for them.\n\nIt just made me think there must be something deeply wrong with me.\n\nLife went from bad to worse.\n\nThen I came across someone who helped me wake up from the dream of my thinking.\n\nThis person helped me see that all feelings are generated from within, not from achievements, practices, or possessions.\n\nSo I stopped strategizing, fearing, blaming myself, and worrying about what I said and what I did.\n\n* \"Oops, didnt cold shower long enough!\"\n* \"Whoops, didn't journal exactly after doing yoga at exactly 8pm!\"\n* \"Oh no, have to restart my \"streak\" for missing the gym. Our ancestors would have never missed a day of activity!\"\n\nInstead, **I began moving and got on with life.**\n\nLike animals. (Ever notice how they don’t need self improvement programs and practices to be awesome at life?)\n\nToday, my approach is fundamentally unintellectual.\n\nI cut myself slack. As much slack as it takes.\n\nI don’t spend much time monitoring what I say and do.\n\nAnd if I say or do something stupid or negative, I don’t give myself a hard time about it. I just take a mental note and move on. Self punishment isn’t necessary for learning. Or even that useful.\n\nInstead, I just let my life flow.\n\nPlease do not take this the wrong way. I am in no way saying to live life however you want and not be aware of your actions, I'm saying to LIVE life.\n\nIt’s amazing how easy and effortless life becomes when you just do what occurs to you and stop spending so much time in your head.\n\nSo rather than add yet another thing to do and practice and **remember to improve yourself**, realize how far you have come and how awesome that is. The rest will take care of itself.\n\nStop thinking and get on with it.",

        "text": "For the past year or two, I got terribly addicted to Instagram (mostly) and Reddit on my phone. I could spend 4-5 hours of screentime on my phone every day, then more on my laptop as I work from there. Few months ago, I got rid of Reddit (I spent 2-3  hours a day there) and really didn't feel any need to install it back. Even now I go here only on my laptop maybe 2 times a week and just for few minutes.\n\nInstagram was far worse to get rid of. Every day, without a skip, I would wake up next to my boyfriend (who does the same), pick up my phone, check the time and go straight to Instagram. I scrolled on my page, then spend maybe 20-30 minutes watching reels. Just mindlessly, endlessly scrolling until I got bored and got out of bed. Then everytime I got sad, frustrated, bored (even during watching a movie) during the day I whipped out my phone and scrolled. I did the bare minimum for the day, and it somehow was evening again and time to go to bed. I watched reels for some more time, then maybe read for a while and fall asleep.\n\nMy mind felt so scattered, my attention span non existent. I couldn't focus on anything at all, just the trending songs/audios playing in my brain on a loop, even when I tried to sleep. I tried many times to get rid of it, it was my New Years resolution, and I failed so many times to cut it off. Lasted maybe few days, but when my life got bad or I really just got bored, I would fall in the rabbit hole again.\n\nThree days ago, I tried again. For the 26th time maybe. I did not delete the app, I just moved it out of my sight, I turned off notifications, told my boyfriend and friends to contact me on Messenger/WhatsApp instead. I allowed myself to check the Instagram messages once or twice a day, only through a web browser – and I didn't watch any stories, I didn't scroll. \n\nMy phone screentime is down to about an hour a day (I spend it on writing emails, checking my investing account and reading news/responding on Messenger). My mind already feels so much clearer and I feel like my attention span is better. I was in a train yesterday and instead of pulling out my phone and scrolling, I took of my backpack, took out a book and read it. I was really proud of myself.\n\nBut sometimes it can be so hard. Whenever I get slightly bored, my first thought is to pick up my phone. I have to consciously stop myself and do anything else instead. The day is suddenly 4 hours longer than usual, I feel more energized, it is already paying off. One of the things that made me change my mindset was the realization that by scrolling Instagram I am LITERALLY wasting my time. I can read a book, watch a TV show or a movie, learn language, scribble on a paper, read the news, call my mom – any of those things are more productive than watching hundreds of 10-second videos 4 hours a day.\n\nIt is hard because I am often missing the \"mindless\" activity – when I need to turn my brain off for some time, after a studying session for example, I am not in the mood to read another book or go for a walk if the weather is bad. It is then, when I miss the simple movement with my thumb and the content (= dopamine) being presented on a silver platter, without me having to work for it. I am opting for knitting now, it is the same repetitive movement not requiring you to use brain power, but at least I am creating something.\n\nWish me luck, guys.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nThe title. To give you some context, I love debate, and I love to contradict people with details to dig the furthest possible in their opinion. So you think X ? Alright but if you think about A ? Oh okay but then we could argue B etc... you get the gist. I know this can be tiresome for a lot of people but that's what I like, I like debates, I like to see how arguments and positions are framed, thought and carried out. And in the end I often don't necessarily defend a position that I hold, I just want to see how thought through yours is, so sometime people may not know what *I* think about the issue. Chances are sometimes I don't even have an opinion, I just want to know what is thought about it.\n\nHow's victim mentally relevant ? Well I've recently been told that I happen to come off as agressive and closed minded, like I'm not opened to changing my mind, and when I ask questions people don't know  if I really want to have a conversation or if I just want to have my view validated. This happened during an appointment with a uni professor because of some unexpected grievances with my internship's tutors. Out of the blue they marked my intership as failed and I didn't understand that so I wanted to talk about that to my Pr., and he told me that. And well, in this situation I was defending myself for something I clearly disagreed with, and felt a strong sense of injustice and unfairness, so I suppose I was way more engaged and vivid than usual.\n\nBut my problem is, I perfectly understand that I could come off like that, I know my attitude can be tiresome because it can feel like the debate never ends. But that's not how I feel when I'm doing it. Like I said, sometimes I just want to learn about a subject so I ask someone's opinion about it, and I ask questions to fill any \"plothole\" I could find. Or if I do have an opinion well I can change my mind, but I need strong arguments, not changing your mind after 20 seconds of convo doesn't mean you're biggotted (at least to me, I may be wrong !). It's like the first time in years someone tells me that I come off as aggressive, and I don't know if for all of this time it's been true or if it's just this person's opinion. \n\nSo do you think I'm playing the victim ?\n\nI have NO IDEA if anything that I've written makes sense to you, nor if this is the right sub to ask such things. Tell me and I'll edit it in a more comprehensive manner. Sorry for any mistakes, English is my second language.",

Initially, I thought it was the fear of the unknown or something that would get better as I try new things. And it did, for a bit. But now the anxiousness is associated with things I do normally.\n\nAn example would be messaging friends. I will type the message and then delete it cuz I'm not sure how it'll be perceived.

I don't know, maybe its some kind of unresolved childhood trauma, or maybe I'm just a psychopath, but I've always felt mentally numb through out whole life.\n\nI never felt love from my family, even though that I know they love me. I've never felt love *for* my family, even though that they are the best people in the world. I've never felt happy, or sad, or guilty, or remorseful. \n\nThat's why at the beginning of last year, I've decided that I was going to use drugs to go on a spiritual journey and find myself. Needless to say, I left my subconscious voyage with none of my questions answered, and a mild drug addiction that took me months to get rid off. I was so pathetic, I couldn't even spend a weekend being sober. \n\nAt the beginning of this year, I've decided that I'm going to find myself the right way, and I've come to accept my situation. I'm never going to know what's wrong with me, but what I can do is accept it and move on.\n\nI feel like my mental health has improved quite a bit. I've stopped giving a fuck about what people are thinking of me, and I feel much more mentally stronger. \n\nBut one big issue that is still prevalent is that I'm still having a tough time putting my thoughts into words. For the most part I feel like I'm just talking nonsense, and what scares me is that your speech greatly reflects your mental condition.",

These things are all good. \n\nHowever, I also keep finding myself compulsively doing things that only make me feel bad about my body and myself in general. Things like overeating, not sleeping enough, not working out, plucking(trichotillomania), isolating myself from friends, etc. The more I think about it, the more I realize it’s at least partially because I don’t think I deserve any of the positive things in my life rn, and certainly not my partner, which is why I can’t stop doing things that make me feel less desirable and just overall like sh*t.\n\nHow do I get past this?",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nI have had a bad night's sleep for several years now. When I was 20 years old, I had severe nightmares 1-2 times a month in which I dreamed that I was dying. I also screamed during these dreams. I went to the sleep lab to find out if it was a physical or psychological problem. It was a psychological problem. Then I went to a psychotherapist, who didn't really help me. I worked on my mindset myself and tried to analyze what the problem was. I found out for myself that it is the uncertainty of the future in my life that is getting me down. And not the small things, but big uncertainties. I also maximized my physical condition (sports, nutrition, quality social contacts, sunlight). After that I had a phase in which I slept well.\n \nNow I am 27 years old and I am quite stressed as many things are not going as I planned. I'm behind on my master's thesis, I'm getting job rejections, and I'm in the stock market, which doesn't stress me out when I'm doing well, but just stresses me out a lot because I'm not in a good state of mind.\n \nNow I'm sleeping poorly again, which means I'm often unproductive during the day. This in turn leads to the fact that when I go to bed I get slight panic attacks (heart palpitations) because things go differently than planned and I do not know how it looks in 5 months. When I wake up in the night the same thoughts come up, which leads to me not being able to sleep. I know that this uncertainty is normal and that the coincidence will be good. Only unfortunately my body doesn't know that during the panic attacks. Often it's just a thought of a second that triggers heart palpitations, which doesn't go away.\n \nI have tried magnesium, glycine, theanine and ashwagandha before sleep, which doesn't really help either. Do you guys have any tips or mindset shifts that can help me?\n \nThanks a lot for your help!",

She is majoring in computer science. \n\nShe feels stuck because she needs more years to graduate, I believe she might graduate 2024 or early 2025. \n\nShe feels she just been a student. She suffers from depression and anxiety although not diagnosed but we grew up in a toxic household where we were isolated from everything and everyone and we had no family since they live far away. \n\nShe feels stuck that her whole identity is just being a student. We are not doing good financially and she is constantly stress of debt and have a plan for her degree so she doesn't have to pay much in tuition (because of the credits).\n\nDoesn't help that she got into a car accident, she now has 4 spinal hernias.

I know she can do so much but getting out of the routine is hard especially when financially things get so hard and we have no support other than each other.\n\nI feel she could finish her degree and learn UX Design on the side but I am not sure if she wants that. I know things will be hard no matter what, to break into the job field and get hired will be hard. I think it would be good for her to travel too... I hope I could pay for her to have a short trip or something. I just don't know how to help her. She is going through a dark place and not sure how to help. \n\nShe is going through therapy (at the school since is free). But is only 6 sessions and done. Which is not enough. \n\nI just need advice on how to help her or how you get our of the feeling of \"being stuck\"",

        "text": "  \n\nI'm not sure how to express this or if it will ever be posted on Coinfession, but I really need help from the community, especially from the veterans who experienced major losses in the past. I started investing in cryptocurrency in January 2021 when I was 19 years old and living in a third-world country. I had around $23,000 and it was a thrilling experience for me. By April 2021, I was sitting on a fortune of nearly $300,000, with Telcoin being my biggest win. Unfortunately, the May crash wiped out 70% of my investment and I started betting on mid and low-cap coins. I managed to flip my investments to reach over $1.7+ million in unrealized gains and $800,000 in realized gains, but the crash took it all down to $300,000 again. I saw the momentum of Luna and took a big bet on it, only to lose nearly everything in the Luna crash.\n\nI recently moved to a first-world country for my undergraduate program, but I was left with only $15,000. I borrowed money from friends and relatives, trying to make it all back, but I lost $33,000 in total. From May 2021 to November 2021, I found myself $40,000 in debt, including a $7,000 credit card debt that I am currently paying off. The debt spiraled out of control, and I was short the entire time. I will likely graduate from my fast course program in a few months, but it is not what I wanted to pursue. I moved to a first-world country due to a weak passport, low standard of living, bad social circle, corrupt government, and lack of improvement in my home country.\n\nMy current situation is troubling me. I got wiped out from my long positions in January due to over-leveraging and I have been inactive since then. My parents have already spent nearly $59,000 in the past 9 months to fund my lifestyle and education (info: I had taken some semesters online way before) , so I can't ask them for any more. I lost weight, I feel extremely sad and I am self-loathing most of the time. I don't have any soft skills, and my hard skills are mostly computer-related but only half-baked. I tried some SAAS ideas which netted $11k out of $2k, but I lost it all since my revenue dropped significantly and I lost the remainder gambling. I even did manual labor jobs, but I couldn't handle it. I failed two subjects last semester, and this is my last semester, so I have a high course load to get the required credits. Like I said earlier have been doing gig delivery work as a bike driver, but I can't get a car license in this country. I have -$800 in my bank account, maxed out credit cards, and only $90 in my virtual bank to help me survive for the time being. \n\nI can't make friends with the international students and immigrants I interact with because I either look like a liar or a psycho. I moved in with new roommates, but I haven't said anything about my situation. My close friends back home understand everything, but degeneracy has ruined my life. I won't make more than $40,000 a year at most, even after graduating, which is a challenge because I haven't studied at all. While my friends are working and paying their fees while completing their degrees, getting enrolled in FANG internships, and will win in the long term, I can hardly survive to pay my rent. Gig work pays $8 per hour, and I can't work a lot because I need to focus on passing my classes. I feel so bad about myself, and I have come to understand the value of money that I once lost.\n\nI have been charting everything in my life lately even after breaking away from the crypto world for a month. It feels like my life has been a roller coaster ride in such a short time. At times, I even imagine my life as a chart where I rugged myself bad. I am currently delivering food for a low wage and interacting with others, realizing the mistakes I've made. I am essentially homeless, without any financial support from my family. My plan rn is to pay off my credit card debt and later repay the remaining $33k I owe, with interest, to my friends and family when I am in a better position. I know I messed up badly, but on the positive side, I now want to learn and improve myself. I want to innovate, not just pursue quick wealth, but I lack some skills and have limited passion for coding. I am focused on educating myself by reading books, and after graduation, I plan to hone my coding skills and pay back my college loans that increased due to my poor performance. I feel like a true degenerate, unable to quit trying to make it all back, but I know I need to work towards a better future. I'm constantly meeting people who look down on me, causing my social life to suffer, but I have a strong drive to do something meaningful. I am currently struggling to figure out my next steps. I have a few long-term trades with high potential return, but I question if I will have the funds to capitalize on them when the opportunity arises. I may need to ask for $20-25k from my family, but the risk of losing everything is high and it is a lot from where I am. I'm torn between investing in crypto and potentially losing everything, or leaving the space entirely to fix my life, but potentially missing out on potential gains. What if I am correct yet I can’t capitalize? What if I fuck up more trying? What if I do and loose it all? I am still a student, so I don’t have any way to get high paying jobs to fund myself anymore. I have big aspirations and want to reach my peak before the age of 30, but my situation has brought me to rock bottom. The thought of breakeven seems like a distant dream for most. I don't think I can handle manual labor jobs, but my situation demands it. My instinct is to take a gamble and try to make it all back, but I know I need to resist the urge. I have a passion for entrepreneurship and starting a business, but my family's lack of experience in the business sector and my current situation makes it difficult for me to network and learn about entrepreneurship. I hope I can network anonymously with you all and hopefully grow and learn and someday reveal myself to you all years down the road. I am here to make unbiased friends and take any help needed. I am here to learn and grow and nothing else. This post here is to ask help and suggestions from anyone who has been through something like me, share their opinions and views. And please don’t tell me to “ study, get a job pay your debt and start small again; you know if you are me its really hard when your blood and everything boils you up to make it back”. This entire message was edited by chatgpt since I am terrible at making my sentences coherent and grammatically correct. And I am really sorry for spamming this everywhere I want my first post to be related to where I stand in life while I journal here but also need to farm karma to post at places I really want to.",

        "text": "My crush and I met at our old job. On our first day, we bonded over growing up in the same hometown and wanting the same sort of profession. About two weeks into us working there, we spoke for about an hour one day about our high school experiences. I mentioned that I never had a boyfriend in high school. I present as very quiet and socially awkward. He told me about something traumatic that happened to him. I expressed my sympathies, but it wasn’t as empathetic as I should’ve been. I talk to him a fair amount, and it's clear that he really likes me. There's been times when he's flirted with me, and friends have told me that he's super into me.\n\nI consider myself to be really good looking. I wear a full face of makeup to work, and I have a nice body. I can tell he’s attracted to me. My family also has money, so I don’t know if maybe that’s attractive to him. He likes me, but I don’t get why. I’m not very charismatic or talkative. I wouldn’t be surprised if he thinks I’m a little bit ditzy. There’s been moments where I was being a total ditz at work. I do admit that his father was abusive to him, and he kind of has this \"hero\" syndrome. Especially since he was abused and bullied while younger, he has this tendency to take care of the underdogs. He likes to come in and save the day for me. I’d like to mention that he’s very emotionally intelligent. He takes pride in being a hard worker and likes to take care of others.\n\nMy question is, why does he like me? Yes, I may be pretty, I may be wealthy, but I know for a fact that he likes me. Not to mention, I know for a fact that he's not this superficial person. So I just want to know. Does he like that I've never been with a guy before? Does he likes that because of my ditziness and dependent vibe, he feels a need to protect me? Does he want his kids to be good looking too?",

        "text": "*Just a heads up, I understand there's a whole anti-social media wave within self-improvement but that wouldn't really be beneficial to me considering my country's culture. Where I live, not having a social media presence is the same as having a disability given how ingrained it is in people's way of life.*\n\nI'm an old guy, I don't know the social landscape anymore. I want to disconnect from some people's social media, it's not that I hate them or anything, I just don't want to interact with their posts or have them interacting with mine. I'm thinking I could just do the \"polite\" filtering and muting options available but I feel like that's sly and much more disrespectful than just unfriending them. Since, that's just my personal opinion and I don't really know how things actually go nowadays, I would like some inputs on this. TIA",
