        "text": "With films like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and most recently Annihilation, I have read at least some discussion on \"intelligent\" science fiction versus things like Star Wars.  I don't think I particularly like that term, as with many blockbusters there are intellectual elements (usually).  But what I have found interesting is the rise (or maybe it's always been there) of the thoughtful sci fi film.\n\nthe three that I listed spring to mind first and foremost in this sub-genre, as they are all sci-fi dramas; in that there is little to no action throughout the bulk of the film's running time, and there tends to be a focus on heady themes that you don't really see in popcorn films.  \n\nThese movies also seem to relate to the subjective perspectives of their main character(s), usually trying to say something about the human condition.\n\nAnyway, these are just some jumping off thoughts, I am curious to know what you all think.",

I had felt that since his film, \"Attenberg\", his film had been getting better and better. Stylistically, this trend continues with his latest film, \"The Killing of Sacred Deer\". So many elements of this film, such as the cinematography and soundtrack, are exceptional. But, I feel the plot isn't in his latest film, isn't anywhere near as engaging as previous films.\n\nUsually, the acting (or apparent lack of) in Lanthimos' films are incredible, and the same is true in this film for Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan and the majority of the cast. But Nicole Kidman for me really ruined my experience watching the film, I felt her demeanor and style of acting didn't fit well with Lanthimos' style.\n\nSo, in summary, I can't seem to see past the miscasting of Nicole Kidman and the lack of depth and complexity of plot seen in \"The Lobster\" for example. Is this an uncommon opinion, do people disagree?  ",

In the above video, my friend David and I deep-dive into the iconography of Point Break and basically drown in Bigelow's brilliantly cynical form. It's uhh... worth a cursory glance.. or a complete watch. :)\n\nWhat are some of your favorite action films to over-analyze? What are your thoughts on Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break? Do you think it's just cheesy or that it's an astute deconstruction of action movie tropes (as I like to argue)? Where does Point Break fall in your ranking of Bigelow's films?\n\nALSO - It has been SO LONG since I have seen Bigelow's short student film The Set-Up and I would really like to watch it again. Does anyone know where this can be found online? I have searched YouTube for it but have come up empty. I know it's available somewhere because I'm pretty sure that I've seen it, in fact I'm basically positive that I have. If anyone can provide me with a link to it online, it would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\nSurfing! Anarcho-Mystics! Bank Robbers! Ex-Presidents! Chicks! Guns! Swayze!\n\nThis totally tubular film is EXTRAORDINARY. Join us in our over-analyzation of Kathryn Bigelow's masterpiece of hyper-masculinity. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vCB-XPRN5o\n\nI hope to have a good conversation on this board. Hopefully you don't ALL think I'm over-analyzing the film. I think it is an unmistakably deconstructionist take on action icons. What do you think?\n\nI have also posted this to r/flicks. I don't mean to flood movie reddit. I won't post material like this in two separate groups in the future if there is quite a bit of overlap between the members. I'll keep an eye out for that. ",

        "text": "\nWhile watching Annihilation, Alex Garland’s new film released worldwide on Netflix, my first thought isn’t that it reminds me of his previous film, Ex Machina. Rather, I’m reminded of J. G. Ballard’s The Drowned World. Truth be told, I guess my first thought was that I wished it was in a cinema that I was watching it, but nevertheless...The Drowned World sees scientists losing their minds in a swamp-turned London. As the new creatures and incessant heat hypnotise them out of time and mind, they are enraptured by this new chaotic place, forgetting the old world and searching for paradise in the new one. Annihilation sees our scientists become hypnotised by the new chaotic order of nature, its creatures and creations stretching the realms of what we thought could exist. The two ecological parables share similar warnings about nature, about man, and about how we find our place when the world around us can change so drastically.\n\nOthers think more of Tarkovsky and his meditations on existence and memory found in Solaris and Stalker, and I see that too. Memories become real, and concrete, like in Solaris. ‘The Shimmer’ of the film forces our all-female reconnaissance team to confront the deepest parts of themselves, depths they know exist but can’t face. Those that can’t reconcile with themselves die violently. For those that can, well, something else happens. Just as Stalker does, Annihilation ruminates on what makes up a human, the paradoxical impulses, the desires and fears, the memories, the emotions. Stalker, as the slower and more ponderous of the two, implies much of this, leaving its characters inner lives just that; internal. Annihilation refracts what’s inside us, and externalises it to be viewed. It’s something we can’t look away from. As the scientists head deeper into The Shimmer, it becomes harder and harder for them to avoid what’s inside them. Film is the perfect medium for such themes, and for such an idea. Instead of overt description with words, we see the internal terrain of characters mapped out before them.\n\nBut maybe instead I think more of Jonathan Glazer’s Under The Skin, a film of implied meaning and dense, semiotically rich images. It looks at humanity through the eyes of the Other. In Under The Skin, Scarlett Johansson looks human but is far from it, detached completely from everything that makes us who we are. Underneath, she is alien. Even at the end of the film, as she peels away the skin she’s wearing, we get the sense that what’s underneath still isn’t who she truly is, that we’ve simply peeled away a single layer of camouflage and that more remain. Under The Skin’s impressionistic sequences are evoked in Annihilation, during the climax as we see imitations of humans. The ‘being’ in Annihilation imitates and mirrors Natalie Portman’s Biologist.  It is because of, and not in spite of, the inhuman and uncanny valley the alien inhabits that The Biologist comes to understand herself.\n\nBetter yet, the influence of David Cronenberg’s Videodrome or John Carpenter’s The Thing - classic body horrors that belie a deeper truth about our inner lives and what makes us ‘us’ - is obvious. Not least during a grotesquely unexpected exploration into someone’s abdomen, a la Videodrome. Peter Weir’s Picnic At Hanging Rock or Carol Morley’s The Falling share elements too, an unreality and an uncertainty about what’s fact and what’s imagined, and how our psychology and inner lives can be responsible for this.\n\nPerhaps too, Josef Conrad’s Heart Of Darkness and by extension, Coppola’s Apocalypse Now are influences. This time, however, instead of descending into the depths of what ‘man’ can become, as if ‘man’ is something apart from ourselves, we look at what ‘we’ become. Us, me, you, I.\n\nMaybe Annihilation is like all of these. I think so. It’s like them in specific ways, and unlike them in many others. It’s unlike a lot of films I’ve seen, and it’s cemented Alex Garland as a voice strong enough and confident enough to match those above. To be mentioned with them, and not compared to them.\n\nThis is part of an article I wrote [here](http://www.filmosophy.co.uk/annihilation_ecological_parable.html) for my website Filmosophy, so I’d be remiss not to plug it a little at the end here, if you like the article check out some of our other stuff.",

        "text": "As a kid growing up in the horror and fantasy heavy 1980s, the computer age bringing us Tolkien in big-budget form with top shelf talent was a much appreciated bit of nostalgia from Hollywood.  None of us expected it to supplant *Goodfellas* or *The Godfather* but we did want something more than the 70s era cartoons that the films were previously made into, and Peter Jackson delivered.\n\nAt the time, Jackson said in response to the question of why he was doing these films so long after Tolkien's death that (paraphrased), \"prior to now (the late 1990s) the CGI technology did not exist to do them properly, but now the technology is there, it's time to make these films.\"\n\nI would argue that it's time for two more literature film projects to be made, that have been flirted with in various forms and abandoned in the past:\n\nJohn Milton's *Paradise Lost* and Dante Alighieri's *Inferno*.\n\nThe latter has had a modern anime-type cartoon adaption made, which is a decent effort as far as animation goes, but as with the Tolkien examples it's still a cartoon at the end of the day.  The technology exists to bring Hell to life, so to speak, so it's time to do it.\n\nWarner began a *Paradise Lost* project in recent years and [abandoned it](http://www.indiewire.com/2015/08/warner-bros-couldnt-make-paradise-lost-but-theyll-try-dantes-inferno-260624/) in pre-production, but I think they're leaving money on the table here.\n\nWhile people who haven't read either of the poems in question can see the cartoon adaptation of *Inferno*, I feel like *Paradise Lost* needs explanation for those who haven't read it.  And to be honest, unless you're a literature student at the university level you probably haven't read it all the way through.\n\nIt's dense.  It's difficult to read, and was always that way.  It was difficult to read for people in the 17th century who had an education in the classics going into it. It demands an educated reader that is willing to work on the text to understand its philosophical and theological concepts.\n\nBut despite setting out with a limited intended audience, *Paradise Lost* has influence that persists.  Firstly, it is a manual for what epic film battle scenes are supposed to look like.  It's also a manual for what romanticized angels and demons are like.  I guarantee you that every horror and sci-fi artist from Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker to Stephen King and Clive Barker (and everyone in between) is intimately familiar with the text.  I can also guarantee you that anyone who has designed a fantasy battle scene for a modern CGI film is intimately familiar with it as well. It does not need visual interpretation, Milton tells you in great detail what Eden looks like, what Hell looks like, and what Heaven looks like.  Remarkably, he was *blind* when he composed it.  He dictated the poem to his daughters over a period of years, who wrote the text down for him.  This comes across in the visual descriptions present in the text. The author is forcing the imagery into the mind of the audience, ensuring that they get it right and don't misunderstand the descriptions.  He set out to fill in the holes that the gospels' narratives didn't fill, effectively completing the battle of heaven and hell and fall of mankind into an epic story comparable to the *Illiad* and *Odyssey*.\n\nMilton proclaimed when he wrote it that it would be the last epic poem the world would ever need, and to his credit despite that rather arrogant claim, he was right.  There hasn't been one of significance written since.  \n\nHere's an excerpt from Satan rallying his troops in Hell after they were cast out from Heaven, as an example...\n\n    Yet to their general’s voice they soon obeyed\n    Innumerable. As when the potent rod\n    Of Amram’s son in Egypt’s evil day\n    Waved round the coast, up called a pitchy cloud\n    Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,\n    That o’er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung\n    Like night, and darkened all the land of Nile:\n    So numberless were those bad angels seen\n    Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell\n    ’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;\n    Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted spear\n    Of their great sultan waving to direct\n    Their course, in even balance down they light\n    On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain;\n    A multitude, like which the populous north\n    Poured never from her frozen loins, to pass\n    Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons\n    Came like a deluge on the south, and spread\n    Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.\n    Forthwith from every squadron and each band\n    The heads and leaders thither haste where stood\n    Their great commander; godlike shapes and forms\n    Excelling human, princely dignities,\n    And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones;\n\n*Excerpt From: John Milton. “Paradise Lost.”*\n\nAgain, I know this is difficult to read, so picking out the relevant descriptive details...\n\nSatan waves his spear in the air and a swarm of flying evil angels that is comparable in size to the locust swarms from the bible lands all at once in a synchronous motion on the plains of hell.  After which their leaders, the commonly known demons from the bible, having \"godlike shapes and forms\" and \"princely dignities\" walk forth from the army to surround Satan.\n\ntl;dr: A blind man was writing the textbook for all of your modern epic CGI battle scenes in the late 17th century.  No one has done it better than him since then. It's time to make grand CGI projects great again ;).  Tolkien was all fine and good, but Hollywood owes us *Paradise Lost*.",

I'm just struggling to talk about it i guess because of how complex and convoluted the film's plot structure is. Anyway if anyone has any thoughts it would be very appreciated.\n\nThanks",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/85991t/help_me_understand_the_praise_surrounding_akira/",
        "text": "Never before in my life have I been so utterly baffled by a film so acclaimed. Baffled not by the contents of the film, mind you, but by the overwhelming praise it has received. I've seen Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' called revolutionary, a masterwork, and even one of the greatest films of all time. Often this praise focuses solely on the ambiguous and admittedly riveting structure of its plot, which details a crime through four different contradictory perspectives. What I've yet to see addressed, however, are the numerous bewildering directorial choices that plague every facet of this film's intriguing concept. I've not really any idea of how to structure this, so I've compiled below a list of grievances that I'd like to see justified in defense of the film.\n\n- Much of the acting is tantamount to the worst of over - exaggerated silent film pantomime acting, except this is a sound film released in 1950. The bandit character, for instance, was absolutely insufferable. He's obviously meant to be a bit nutty, though I feel there must have been a better way to portray this than having him hop around like a lunatic whilst spouting a hearty [Tidus laugh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H47ow4_Cmk0) every minute or so. The woman is guilty of this as well; one moment she's on the ground, limbs outstretched, crying, the next she's sprung right up with an accompanying [Tidus laugh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H47ow4_Cmk0), getting in characters' faces, and the next she's hiding behind a tree stump screaming her head off as if after only a moment of fierceness she's again become a fragile, helpless person.\n\n- Continuing off of some what I've already mentioned, it seems like almost none of the characters in this film behave as humans. Why is it that it seems like everybody in the film is obsessed with flopping onto the ground? During the final interpretation the film presents us with, we are shown a 'duel' wherein both parties involved run towards each other, only to collapse onto the ground and writhe around as if they were both mimicking an epileptic seizure. I gathered that the film is trying to show us that although they feign strength, they are both, at heart, weak - willed individuals. Was there not a better way of demonstrating this to the audience then to have them both randomly crash to the earth? The scene wherein the dead man tells his story through a medium was, as the rest of the film is, conceptually engaging but interrupted by bizarre, inexplicable moments. One minute, he's telling of his own suicide by means of some spiritual incantation, and the next minute, his medium is squirming around on the floor for seemingly no reason. The woman appears to be afflicted with violent mood swings, constantly crying, then speaking normally, crying again, being assertive, being submissive, etc. Again, perhaps this was meant to play into the film's commentary on the nature of truth, but not a single time did it ever feel natural. The bandit, good *god* the bandit. Truly he behaved as any feared and notorious beast of a man would, by bouncing around and acting like a cut - rate clown for every scene in which he appeared.\n\n- Many of the film's scenes / shots dragged on far longer than they should have. I'm mainly referring to any scenes that involved the bandit; the longer I was forced to watch his cacophonous antics, the more pained I became. For instance, why is it that we had to watch his character hop around a tree for a whole minute? Why is it that we had to watch him jump towards and away from the camera while shouting for a whole minute? Why is it that every one of the film's most awkward moments seemed to last an eternity? It's akin to having the character of the motel owner in 'Touch of Evil' pervade every scene in the film, a prospect so torturous that I refuse to dedicate even a moment more of my thought to considering it.\n\nI've come here seeking understanding. If you think you're able to enlighten me as to why this film is considered one of the giants of cinema, please let me hear what you have to say.\n\nI look forward to participating in an engaging and thoughtful discourse on the matter.",

        "author": "Onlycitrus",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/858v7l/thoughts_on_downsizing/",
        "text": "On many levels I enjoyed the movie - it was more than I expected and generally it was a decently smart and a nice watch (having some great actors helped too). The tone of the movie reminds me of Interstellar for some reason even though I regard Interstellar as a much better movie comparatively and just an incredibly fun/inspiring watch (personal opinion).  \n\n\n    \nNow for the problem. I think that I must agree with what I have seen others say online, that the movie tries to do a little bit too much and while those snippets sort-of work we don’t get to discover the issues being raised more thoroughly. Topics/themes/issues are either one-liners or almost self-contained sketches. Several times it is implied that there is/will be discrimination against little people/immigration issues are raised/people ignoring global warming/inequality among little people. All these separate and occasionally somewhat inter-related issues are presented to the viewer without much resolution or even a strong stance/opinion of the movie.\n\nThis experience sort of leads me to view the movie not through the meta-frame of global issues but on a very small personal level. The story of Paul. And viewing the story simply through him I would say the main theme of the movie would be finding one self or depression. Even prior to losing his wife the main character showed signs that he wasn’t in a place that he wanted to be. The whole doctor thing is brought up several times in the movie. Then once he goes through the process he loses his wife. Finally, I feel what the movie did brilliantly was juxtapose his loss of purpose/depression with all that materialistic glamour that doesn’t bring him any happiness. The whole downsizing also cheapens the materialism, which I think is honestly a great forced perspective shift - although you have this whole splendour and luxury you are there alone and even in the grand-scheme of things its ‘fake’ luxury as its all tiny.\n\nSo the final resolution to his finding one-self/ending depression culminates in two-fold solution - helping others and being inspired/falling in love with a determined and strong woman who loves and cares for others. Here I probably have the most of the issues with the movie. The ending didn’t sell it enough I think. I do not think that helping others really fulfils him the way they portrayed it (there was even a scene earlier in the movie where he sort of agrees with his neighbour to “get off the hook” out of helping).\n\nIn general except for choosing to downsize and the decision at the end of the movie, Damon’s character is extremely passive and doesn’t make many bold/strong decisions. Even the relationship I felt wasn’t fully sold - in the end Damon seems to give into the ending almost reluctantly, like “Eh… why not, what else is it there to do”. (They don’t help by adding scenes such as him making his decision in the tunnel only after learning the duration of the travel).\n\nSo even though I mostly forgive the rocky and somewhat messy ride with occasional brilliant surrealism, the destination or the ending was lacking for me - it was just too flat. While it did seem to me that their ending message was “go help and love others to fulfil oneself”. I’m not even sure what it is that is missing, was it too cliche? Was the character just not showing enough resolution in the end? \n\nI felt like the director Forrest Gumped the main character through this cool new invention and these social issues and problems while having him seek an answer to his personal troubles… without a satisfying solution.",

I really liked how it was a kind of documentary style, instead of just a regular storytelling method. It made it seem very real and I thought this did a great job of showing everyone's side to the story. Obviously, this story has many, many sides to it and no one can agree on which one is the truth and the movie did a good job at not being too biased. The acting was really good! Allison Janney (not sure how to spell her name) was really good as Tonya's mother. She was brutal and honesty and I think she really got into the role. I'm glad she won the Oscar, she deserved it! Margot Robbie of course, also did is great job. My mother who was alive when all this was happening said that she sounded a lot like real Tonya Harding, so I'll take her word for it. She did great portraying emotions physically, through her facial expressions. I thought the figure skating scenes were done really well, although I don't really know much about figure skating so I could be totally wrong. The occasional break of the fourth wall was nice and didn't break the flow of the movie at all. The casting was very accurate (in terms of appearance). One thing I really liked about this movie was that you could really tell what the screenwriter and director were thinking when they worked on this movie. You can kind of imagine their train of thought especially during the scenes with music (also credits to the composer, of course) and it's really cool to see that.\n\nWhat did everyone else think of it?

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI recently got to see *Thoroughbreds* and have seen very little discussion about the film. I'd love to talk about the film here and read some ideas others might have about the film. \n\nMy two cents:\n\nThe film drew my attention because I admire the previous work of the three leads (Anya Taylor-Joy, Olivia Cooke, and Anton Yelchin) and the kinetic editing of the trailer. It seemed like a simple premise that was to be enhanced by the writing of the characters and that's something I'm completely on board with. I did a bit of research and found that the director, Cory Finley, is a playwright and that the script was conceived as a stageplay. This made me a tad hesitant since I didn't think that Kenneth Lonergan's direction in *Manchester by the Sea* was as effective as it could've been. \n\nFortunately, Finley seems more of a Sam Mendes than a Lonergan. The direction of the actors' performances is spot on and it's clear that Finley was able to effectively communicate and realize exactly how he wanted the characters to be. The writing was entertaining and had a lot of energy without being stuffy. One thing I dislike about a lot of current films (especially big-budget studio tentpoles) is that they cut the film within an inch of its life while also sacrificing breathing room. My most recent example of this is *King Arthur: Legend of the Sword* by Guy Ritchie. I'm a fan of Ritchie's films and how he manages to balance their mile-a-minute pace with plenty of character development and expertly timed humor. However, *King Arthur* had almost no breathing room whatsoever. Things just kept happening, with scenes ending almost abruptly in order to rush to the next one. I can only remember the names of two characters and I can barely re-tell the events of the film. *Thoroughbreds* manages to develop its two main characters, and one supporting character, in just 92 minutes without the film feeling rushed or overstuffed. The performances obviously compliment the writing a ton, but I still found it remarkable how well the film was written.\n\nMy favorite thing about the film was the cinematography. Finley clearly has an eye from visual storytelling and made a great choice in working with Lyle Vincent (*The Woman in Black*, *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night*, *The Bad Batch*). One of the first shots of the film is of a large SUV pulling up to the mansion where most of the film takes place. The camera follows the car, keeping its distance as it pulls up. The movement is smooth, but not precise like it would be in a Fincher film. The camera sways back and forth, floating behind the car. The choice to shoot anamorphic really compliments the vastness of the house, the wide aspect ration almost struggling to contain all of the opulence in the environment of these characters. The lenses are soft and imperfect, often distorting the image as the camera sways during the many tracking shots in the film. This is fitting, since these privileged characters live in these gorgeous houses, wear expensive clothes, drive expensive cars, and have expensive hobbies... and yet there are cracks in the facade, a warping of their reality which reveals how ugly they can be.\n\nTying into this, the film also acknowledges the privilege of the two lead characters. The first major example is a rather comedic scene set to a (beautiful) rendition of 'Ave Maria'. Anton Yelchin's character is invited to the home of Taylor-Joy's character. Upon arriving, he gazes up in a slow-motion, wide angle shot of the mansion. As the camera tilts up, the characteristic distortion of the anamorphic lens warps the gargantuan facade of the building as we see it from the eyes of someone who will never be able to live that kind of life. The second example is a mini-monologue (mini-logue? idk) from the step-father character played by Paul Sparks. The entire film has seen his character through the eyes of Taylor-Joy, giving us the impression of a bad guy. Sure, he is rude to his wife, played by Francie Swift, and is less-than-friendly toward Cooke's character. That being said, he reveals himself in this mini-logue directed at Taylor-Joy's character, in which he digs into her for being selfish and without empathy toward others, confronting her about her treatment of everyone else as a servant and nothing else. So, while I would've loved for Finley to dive deeper into the themes of privilege, he is not completely ignorant about the position of his characters in the world. I acknowledge that this maybe a low bar to set (\"yeah just mention it and you're good\"), but there's still a lot going on in the film.\n\nBefore I finish rambling, I'd like to address one of quibble I have with the film. Anton Yelchin's character is revealed to be a sex offender, having committed statutory rape before the events of the film took place. In interviews with the cast, Anya Taylor-Joy mentioned how Yelchin's character is the \"moral center\" of the film. Whether this is her actual opinion or a poorly expressed way of talking about the late Yechin, I want to go over this. In the film, Yelchin's character constantly talks about how he's going to be \"running the game\" of selling drugs to teenagers, yet he works in a nursing home and lives with his father. He's basically a loser, blackmailed by Taylor-Joy and Cooke so that they have an alibi for when he commits a crime for them. The problem I see with Taylor-Joy's statement about \"moral center\" is that... he really isn't. The only moral thing he does is refuse to commit a serious crime. I think giving his character that kind of credit is disingenuous and gives me flashbacks to how in *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri*, a character who tortured black people has this element of their life reduced to a character trait (torture is far too serious to be reduced to a trait) and is given a redemptive arc. Thankfully, Yelchin's character has no such arc, and while the two main characters also commit heinous crimes, the film doesn't try an paint them as good people just because they are the protagonists. \n\nThat's it! If you made it this far, I really appreciate it. I'd love to hear from other people about what they thought of the movie, any themes or ideas they noticed in the writing or the filmmaking techniques used, or anything of the sort!",

        "text": "Towards the beginning of Loveless, there’s a scene where we’re first introduced to the mother’s boyfriend. They’re out to dinner at a fancy restaurant. The scene begins with a POV shot as we hear a man’s voice ask a beautiful woman for her phone number. She gives it to him and then proceeds to sit down at her table (with, I think, another guy). Then  it seems we stay in the POV as we winds through the restaurant. Then the long POV shot cuts right before we reach the table. \n\nWe never hear from the voice again or learn about the POV. And it doesn’t seem to factor into the storyline. So I’m curious to hear what people’s take on it is. \n\nI did some reading up on Loveless after seeing it, including posts from here, since I was especially interested in any insight into the film’s commentary on Russia. While without knowing very much about Russia’s recent history, it’s easy to pick up on some points (especially the relatively blatant symbolism in that final shot with the treadmill) I was interested to hear more learned people’s thoughts. One commentary I read briefly brought up the subject of paranoia in the film. And really that’s the only thing I can think of for that strange voice. \n\nIt happens before the child goes missing, so it’s a weird in that sense—although I don’t necessarily think the film was trying to pepper in clues about the child’s disappearance, more just jarring moments to remind you of the uncertainties out there. Another similar moment was much later, during the search, when the shot lingers on a bus stop before panning to follow a random man as he walks down a shadowy path into the woods as the nightt’s darkness sets in. \n\nAnyway, I was curious to hear what others thought. Even with my interpretation that scene still feels like it sticks out. But maybe that’s the point. ",

        "author": "ZacharyConan",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/854cvb/thoughts_on_fellini_satyricon/",
        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbi5T5zF6tU\n\nI had to write some thoughts down on what might just be Fellini's most divisive film.\n\nSatyricon is about alien worlds. You’re a visitor here - you’re not entirely welcome and no one is impressed. You’re interrupting some Pagan ultraviolence. You’re confusing them and they don’t particularly appreciate that. They don’t particularly appreciate you at all. You’ve stumbled upon some psycho ritual and it’s YOU they’re offering to their ferocious Gods.\n\nIt’s a film with no psychology. It’s staring at you. It’s unfriendly. It’s dementedly curious. There are no value judgements here. You have reached some ancient pylon. Satyricon as some nexus - a Godhead. Fellini’s time has no rubric and no rules. Past, present, future - all folds and dimensions bend and collapse, and abuse each other. Concepts like those matter not at all. You have made it to the centre where nothing matters and everything is perverted.\n\nSatyricon is incomprehensible fresco anarchy. It’s a film about eccentricities that often experiments with sensory overload, sensory deprivation, and pure madness. It’s Fellini as psychotic as Fellini could get. The visual maestro is lush - his universe is repulsive, corrosive, and stunning. Satyricon is truly individualistic. Everything about Fellini’s manic parade of barbaric neurosis is genuinely individual - every once of the film has its own character and very specific and free features. If you’re prone to drooling over Magali Noël’s deliriously insatiable form - like I hopelessly am - you may want to prepare yourself for the depravity, the lewd artistry and how uncomfortably aroused everything makes you feel.\n\nIt has a liberating quality. Satyricon makes you want to scream and fuck like some neon sex maniac turned time traveling mystic and interloping pornographer. This is Fellini’s idea of the Ancients. These are not artifacts, they’re not ghosts - they’re extra-terrestrials. They are foul, nauseating Martians with perpetual hard-ons and aesthetically gifted sensibilities. Satyricon is a remarkable experience and it’s one I will never forget. It's a stark raving mad illustration of psychotic, ancient glee. It’s been improperly indexed as simply a picaresque experiment when its total classification defies any and all intellectual logic.\n\nFellini’s psychopathic composition is flawless. He achieved precisely what he wanted to. Fellini wanted to capture ancient terror and hyper-sexual, warped-pagan lunatic frenzy - and that’s exactly what he did. Fellini is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time. Satyricon is easily his most challenging work - not at all his most complicated film, that’s not what I’m saying - Satyricon is difficult, taxing, and stimulating.\n\nAny attempt to apply meaning to it would be intellectually dishonest. Satyricon has none. Satyricon has no story and no star - absolutely no solid framework from which to build an analysis with any sort of filmic integrity. There’s nothing else in the world quite like it - Satryicon is a film without meaning, but full of purpose.\n\nSatryicon is demanding because it positively refuses to be intellectualized. Fellini’s bizarre masterpiece of the weird outright rejects comprehension. This is how the film was designed to behave. It’s an art film you can’t digest. It’s a visual fugue that you will never understand. Fellini doesn’t want you to - he forbids it. Satyricon consumes you - you don’t imbibe it. It’s like intellectual rape. Fellini pummels you with grotesquerie, with startling beauty, and with relentless mania. He knows filmgoers have a penchant for outsmarting or over-intellectualizing - so he produced something undefinable, ineffable, and impossible. Satyricon is basket case perfection.\n\nPetronius would have been proud - I am sure of it. Satyricon has driven me bonkers - Fellini has made me certifiably insane. I’m incurable now. My condition has liberated me and I’m an ancient monster. I’m primal, but I’m as complicated as the Satryicon itself. We’re both motivated by absurd fantasy. We are compelled to do what we do because of an ancient rage, a multitude of ancient passions, and a fleet of ancient Gods. Fellini has turned me into a madman.\n\nHow do you make a film without a psychology?! How can you produce ANYTHING without some sort of narrative reasoning? Satyricon is unforgivably unorthodox in that Fellini absolutely dismisses justification or pretext in favor of saucer-like insubordination and uncooperative forays on psycho-sexual and sardonically transcendental ruminations. Somehow - in some way - Fellini meticulously orchestrated a gorgeously opulent opera of the senses, of the urges, and of the Ancients - without ANY psychology or philosophy. Satyricon is so unreasonably disobedient, so unreasonably detached, and so unreasonably unique that it occupies a space in the film pantheon reserved only for ineffable and divine pieces. Satyricon is something to behold. Satyricon is limitless in its erotic and revolting dementia.\n\nSatyricon is pandemonium allure. I’m deeply attracted to its compositional magnificence. I am infatuated by its successful resistance of any sort of logical compliance whatsoever.\n\nI always can appreciate any opportunity to gawk lovingly at Magali Noël - she was obviously crafted by some remarkably gifted Goddess and given to film as a gift, as an eternal icon of feminine perfection. Fellini knew how to pick his women and there is no shortage of knockouts in Satyricon. It’s a tour de force of intoxicating images, women, color, and fury. It’s a masterpiece.\n\nIt’s about the silver magic of the Pagans and the rainbow clarity of the Ancients.\n\nIt’s about a vibrant and evocative alien planet.\n\nIt’s about colorful and impossible beauties.\n\nIt’s chaotic. It’s unreasonable. It’s fascinating. It’s sensational.\n\nI positively adore it.",

This is supposed to signify his no-nonsense toughness, and when the suppressed prisoners finally insurrect, he takes his shirt off to show that he no longer has to hide his true self and joins the fight (against the guards led by a black man, of course). Him being a Neo-Nazi does not make him a bad guy – he befriends the protagonist and gives great prison advice too. He reminded me of Derek in *American History X*, whose white body with a Swastika tattoo is glorified in a way that would make Leni Riefenstahl jealous; that guy is also portrayed as a (tragic?) hero. These are only two movies, but I was wondering: Do you know of any more movies that have characters like this? Is this perhaps a common trope in Hollywood cinema? I also thought of the ending of *Inglorious Basterds*, but the meaning there is the exact opposite, as the swastika becomes a sign of shame instead of pride (which to me makes much more sense).",

Tonight I watched Dogtooth. Now, I'm sure many would consider these, and especially Dogtooth boring movies, but somehow they engross me fully. For the duration of Dogtooth my impulse for instant gratification was gone. I didn't even mind that the movie didn't answer much of anything. Normally I hate that. I loved Batman Vs Superman, and Watchmen is one of my favorite movies. Normally I'm all about the aesthetic, the presentation and the music. But Lanthimos is almost clinical, though his movies are beautiful, but in an understated way. \n\nI also want to know what his style means. I'm not even sure how to describe what separates his movies from the rest. There's a constant bizarre quality to them. It feels more like I'm studying and learning about a new people than anything else.\n\nThere's more I could say about his style, and the acting and dialogue in his movies, but I'm not sure how to put it accurately.

        "text": "I have been very disappointed in the look and feel of a lot of modern movies. Mostly the big-budget more action focused movies, but also others. I first just noticed that something is off, the didn't have that \"real\" feel that a lot of older movies had. Of course, as everyone else, I first blamed CGI. I thought that CGI was ruining movies and should be abondoned completely by film-makers. But that's objectiovely wrong. Great things can be done with CGI. Bad things as well, but that's true with everything. The more I thought about it I realized it must be something else.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is that althogh there are most certainly a lot of reasons for this, a big one is that the scenes are often just too busy. There is simply too much going on for my eyes to focus on what's important and it often just looks plain bad.\n\nBefore, when effects were really, really expensive and budgets were more limited, you had to choose where to use those effects, and think very, very carefully how you use them. So naturally, there was less going on in the effects department in each scene. When you made an action scene in a city, you didn't have buildings crumpling everywhere and people falling out of windows, and cars crashing and smoke trails flying and bombs going off, all that besides the actual action which you are supposed to follow with you know, the characters. cough... Avengers... cough...\n\nToo busy visuals has a couple of problems, buth with storytelling and simple aesthetics. Generally when there is too much going on, we don't latch on to some really great effects, we don't know where to look, and it all just flows into this mess of stuff happening. That takes the emotional effect from special effects away almost completely. Then it gives us too many distractions from the story going on. This is expecially bad in action scenes where the stakes aren't focused on a few key set pieces anymore. When there is dangerous stuff happen everywhere, it doesn't seem as dangerous anymore. Take the moria scene in lord of the rings as a good example, everythings is focused on the stairs, or the balrog, or the goblins, or the troll, each in their own scene. And then in the hobbit movies they were just slicing goblins left and right and everything was happening all at once. There was nothing for our brains to latch onto and see as the danger or the problem. And aestetically I think we like things to be relatively simple, even if an element like a monster is really compicated we can see it as one object, we know what is what. But more importantly, having too many things going on is a shot makes the layout really hard to get right. You just can't make a well layed out shot when the whole screen is covered in equally detailed things. These are some of the reasons why depth of field is used, to simplify the elements that aren't ralative to a blur and keep the focus, literally, on what's important in the shot.\n\nSome film-makers seems to things it's a more impressive spectacle the more is going on in the scene. But that's just not true. Less is often more.",

        "text": "I know there's already been a lot of discussion, but given that the movie made me crumble emotionally like none other has, I feel an urgent need to try to illuminate it and therefore overcome it; like an incendiary grenade on a shadow creature.  Besides comments from /r/truefilm, the articles that helped me the most in this analysis were: [Livingstone at the New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/147201/annihilation-brilliant-splicing-woolf-cronenberg), [FilmCritHulk](https://filmcrithulk.blog/2018/02/27/annihilation-the-horrors-of-change/), and [Yoshida](http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/annihilation-movie-ending-explained.html) and [Bastien](http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/annihilation-movie-depression.html) at Vulture.  Please let me know if there are others of note.  And sorry for the lighthouse-sized wall of text. \n\n**THEMES**\n\n**Destruction/Creation**: It all starts of course with the discussion of how cells have an in-built self-destruct timer, how cancer is a mutation the circumvents that (see: HeLa cells, referenced with the book \"Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\"), then we are shown how the shimmer cause mutations at a faster pace, a noticeable pace, and that it is growing and therefore potentially destroying (or changing) all that it touches. As with cancer it circumvents \"death\" but then puts at risk the body it inhabits. While evolution needs death to propagate mutations, perhaps the shimmer doesn't need death, which is what makes it \"unnatural\". \n\nRegarding this destruction/change dynamic, it does seem like there is no destruction, just change, as represented by the ouroboros. It is similar to how (as many have noted) the particle physic's definition of annihilation is not a destruction, but a changing of matter into light, or technically a combining of a particle and its antiparticle to produce other particles (typically protons and gamma radiation, visible and invisible \"light\", light and \"shadow\" light).  Light of course is a major symbol, notice how the meteor that started everything seemed like a ray of light by the end.  Notice what a light house does (meta: or a projector), and the fact that this light is actually a warning to boats of something that is an existential threat. Yet ironically, people in general and the characters specifically are drawn to lighthouses. Moths, flames, self-destruction, etc. \n\nAnd reinforcing how death is actually just change, Kane's death is turning matter into light as well through phospherous.  But with that death comes a message to the other Kane, Shadow-Kane, which enables him to do what original Kane couldn't: go back to Lena (whose name in greek and persian means sunlight, or is short for Helena which means torch, or is a reference to Helen of Troy). Kane's self destruction also seems related to the bible's Cain and Abel.  Bible Cain is spurned by god and kills his brother, whose \"sacrifices\" god preferred. Movie Cain is spurned by Lena but instead of killing the lover (or her), he proceeds to kill himself by going on this journey.  And at the end, when confronted with the shadow self, again decides to kill himself instead of killing the \"other\".  This is an interesting update of the story, and I'm not sure what they are trying to say, whether this updated \"Cain\" has learned the moral lesson from biblical Cain to not kill others through jealousy, but is still wrong in his attempt to kill himself. Should he be trying to kill \"god\" in that story? Or kill \"Shadow Kane\" in this story, just as Lena did? Is the shadow version \"god\" or the unconscious? \n\nThen of course there is the psychological self-destruction, how each of the women are on their own path of self-destruction, mostly due to past or current trauma (death of others, of a loved one, of a relationship, past version of self and, with Ventress, upcoming physical death of the self) and this experience of destruction, of death, makes them seek it out for themselves, they seem to want to become/know the death they have experienced or will experience. Almost as if they are reflections of their reality. Psychologically, these self-destructive tendencies are pathologies that aren't being expressed and worked out healthily and thus materialize in these habits and actions. The id acting out despite the ego/superego's preference. Many have discussed how this is an exploration of coping mechanisms for death or cancer or nihilism.  Some fight back irrationally or try to destroy everything (Anya), some becoming one with the void or giving in blissfully/ignorantly (Rosie), others looking to understand the void and becoming consumed by it (Ventress).  Cass seems to be in denial, she is too serene, and because she is unaware of her physical/emotional situation, she is the one that is attacked and dies from the unknown (i.e. the unconscious), starting with the alligator coming out of the dark water, or the monster coming out of the dark forest. The tower scene shows the characters' differences, Anya and Rosie are up in the tall tower, away from reality, Ventress and Lina are in the lower tower, not avoiding reality, but alert and semi-protected, and Cass is out in the unprotected wild, and gets eaten because of it.  The trauma of losing her then becomes a bear of a problem that the other have to deal with. Notice that by this point, many more men have died from previous expeditions, maybe indicating that women, because of their greater emotional self-awareness, cause less trauma in themselves, and thus cause less trauma in others. I also wonder whether each woman represents a psychoanalytic personality types (e.g. psychopath, narcissist, schizoid, paranoid, etc.) and use that personality type's preferred defense/coping mechanisms. \n\n**Self/Other**: The only two \"people\" (a couple..) that escape, seemed to have escaped because they cared for someone else. Kane tells shadow Kane to find Lena (so technically Shadow Kane doesn't care about Lena, but perhaps the identity between the two starts to blur), and Lena is looking for Kane, giving her the motivation to kill her shadow self, instead of herself. That seems to be the key to overcoming self-absorption, which typically leads to self-destruction if left unchecked. And Lena only survives being \"herself\" because Kane went first and recorded his experience so she could learn from it.  Also notice Lena is the only one that wants to find out what happened to Cass after she was probably dead, she seems the one most willing to care/protect others and understand what is going on. She is not just trying to block out the ugly part of reality like Anya or Rosie, or, as with Ventress, not caring because it doesn't help her intellectual, self-obsessive goal. \n\nLivinstone writes: \"In To The Lighthouse &lt;by Virginia Woolf&gt;, the building represents an always-out-of-reach object for human desire—that thing that propels us through life and toward each other.\"  and: \"This lighthouse is desire, as with Woolf, and also the frontier that separates our own minds from others’. Here we see an embodied meditation on subjectivity and trauma.\" The Shimmer causes ripples in all it touches, just as trauma causes ripples/mutations in our psyche, and aging/procreating/evolution causes ripples/mutations in our sense of self and what it is to be human, and just as having to relate to others (and empathize/sympathize with others) seems to cause ripples/mutations in our clear sense of subjectivity, of objective truth, of order and intelligibility of the world. The Ventress-becoming-the-alien psychedelic imagery of visuals refracting and mirroring and merging is perfect to recall the cellular mitosis process and for how the brain sees itself in others, mirrors others, how the ego combines/splits with others in relationships or with offspring.  \n\n**Id/Ego**: Please see this [/r/movie comment on a Jungian analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7zqsdy/official_discussion_annihilation_spoilers/dutgb1r/). Livingstone writes: \" The shadow-self is the id, the object that defines the subject, the dark mirror tethered to the self that must be faced if we are to escape it. When Lena destroys the humanoid, all its effects—the crystal trees, the mutations everywhere—burn away in a cleansing fire.\" My interpretation in easy terms is: How do you fight your unconscious when you are your unconscious? You have to know how to destroy yourself (give in to self-destruction?), but also know which you to destroy, which one can only do by knowing yourself. And why do all this? Ultimately because you care for others. \n\nWater/darkness play a major role in the movie, typically representing the id/unconscious (almost cliche? but if it ain't broke..). Its not a coincidence that most of the story takes place in a swamp, where land and water intermingle unpredictably, and that the lighthouse delineates the separation of land and sea.  As I mentioned above, the things that attacks Cass come from the water (or the dark).  The eel-intestine scene happens in a shower, but with no lights and without the showers on, and in that scene they are discovering the horrid reality in one of their own (and at the same time, in themselves).  The blown up man (like a exploded diagram of a human) is found in an empty pool.  I'm not sure what those scenes are looking to represent, except for general body horror / nihilism but I'm guessing there is a more specific meaning. And of course all the scene with a glass of water, and how water is what almost kills shadow Kane at the beginning and the water ripples in Lena's glass at the end. \n\n**Things I'm still unsure about**: \nThe creation of shadow-Lena.  I guess a blood drop falling into the shimmer-entity represent her basic biology, her DNA, her lifeblood being all that she is?  How we are all just a bit of DNA writ large?  Was that entity just the shadow-creature or a shimmer/ventress hybrid?  What is the symbolism?  \n\nWhy the hug at the end? Why does she have her memory but he doesn't? Even if he's a copy/alien, he does say he remembered her face. Is it because by cheating you rob someone of all their memories of the past, and the only way forward is to create new ones?  Is it because he can forgive her and forget, but she will never be able to forget and forgive herself?  Is it about empathy for the \"other\" regardless of where they came from? Is it a message about no matter how much someone has changed (maybe particularly if you've cause the change), you have to keep loving them?  Is it because Lena has to love Kane, despite no longer having a share memory together, but for who he is deep down, at a core personality level?\n\nThe crystal structures.  Why the men died in rooms that should have water but don't.  Why 5 women and not women and men. Why is the bear house the same as Lena's house.\n\n**Final Thoughts** \nEven after exploring all these themes, I still felt like I hadn't understood why the movie impacted me emotionally the way it did.  My theory is that typically in the kinds of adventure or horror genre movies Annihilation references, people are killed off, but they are typically the obnoxious guy, or the spaced out girl, or the tough guy that was going to lead everyone to safety (Worf effect).  But in this movie, all the women were honest, good, well-intentioned people, with tragic backstories, deeply human flaws, made to experience existential horror through a fire hose, instead of the trickle that most of us experience over a longer time-span. And they are killed horribly, or depressingly, or randomly, despite each being a tragic figure that deserved redemption and that could have been a protagonist in their own right. The movie also seems to recall (at least to me, given my personal biases/experiences) aspects of depression or nihilist angst:  the flat colors, seeing beauty but reading it as a threat, the constant dread of the unknown, the characters not being able to communicate with others because they are in a bubble, the final psychedelic overpowering imagery and sound which I think successfully represented the alien otherness/unintelligibility of reality or existence.  Also having all the characters on the screen being self-destructive, not just one, or not just the protagonist, normalizes that feeling of self-destructiveness and makes it OK for the audience to experience it within themselves.

        "text": "In 1906, theatre director Max Reinhardt opened the Kammerspiele in Berlin to present modern drama to small audiences. Its impact was profound, leading to the Kammerspielfilm, a short-lived movement in German silent cinema. Though sometimes set across multiple locations, these films, which include F.W. Murnau’s The Last Laugh (1924), were nonetheless confined dramas focusing on internal character psychology.\n\nThe counterpart for Kammerspiel films, Chamber film was initially derived from the term chamber music and subsequently chamber play. Chamber music constitutes a small group of classical musicians who – originally – could fit in a palace chamber. A chamber play usually comprises three acts dramatized on the stage by a small cast on one unchanging set.\n\nThe first and most well-known proponent of this method of directing for the cinema is Ingmar Bergman, who referred to Through a Glass Darkly (1961), Winter Light (1963), The Silence (1963) and Persona (1966) as his “chamber films”.\n\nAs the concept was taken from plays, what value has cinema added to it? \n\nThere has been a resurgence of chamber films in modern cinema like Steve Jobs, Birdman, Room, Locke. Do smaller cameras from say, Ingmar Bergmann's time, help modern filmmakers to make their own chamber films?\n\nAny type of discussion about chamber films is welcomed. ",

        "text": "**So Spoilers Ahead If You Haven't Seen, \"Whiplash.\"**\n\nSo from the very beginning of the Film, literally the first words spoken in the film. We establish Andrew is a talented drummer who loves what he does. Which explains why is the only one practicing and I noticed the room he was practicing in, it was a rather small room as well. I kind of took it as Andrew is so focused with the drums that he's literally losing contact with people until all he has left are his drums. That's why no one else was in the room, and why the room was rather small. Everything Andrew has is in that small room.  What do you think? Any Truth? Or am I way off?\n\nBut anyway, my question is about Fletcher. Again, from this opening scene, we also establish that Fletcher is an intimidating character. Not just how he speaks to Andrew and because of the reputation he has. But Fletcher literally comes from the shadows, we hear him before we even see his face, letting us trying to remember what JK Simmons looks like. But my question is about his actions throughout the movie and what his thought process might have been during specific scenes.\n\nFirst, at that first seen in the beginning, Andrew stops playing and when asked why he stopped, he plays and when he stops the second time, Fletcher calls him a \"wind up drum monkey\" or something like that. Do you think he walked that hall to see Andrew play because he liked what he heard? Or did he see some poor sap and felt like just messing with the kid, play with his head a little bit. He walks away in the middle of Andrew playing also.  Was he ever really interested in how he was playing? Did he actually like it and that's why he promoted him to the main band the following week? He liked what he heard and wanted to challenge Andrew? Or his entire set of actions and decisions are all there just to mess with some poor kid who knows won't make it and he wants to have his fun.\n\nFinally, WHO TOOK THE DMN FOLDER? The honest reason why I have that theory of Fletcher just messing with Andrew the entire film perfectly plays into why I think Fletcher took the Notebook.  Who do you guys think took it?",

        "text": "There's been a lot of ink spilled recently about the Star Wars fandom and their inability to let go of nostalgia and how *The Last Jedi* was needed to break Star Wars out of its rut and chart a new course for the franchise.  My issue with this line of thinking is how the ST seems to want to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to nostalgia and I'm confused as to why more critics haven't picked up on this.  \n\n*The Last Jedi* has become very divisive in the Star Wars fandom with the majority loving it and a sizable and vocal minority disliking it and I find myself more in line with the minority here, even though I liked the movie and would give it a 6/10.  One of the TLJ's themes is not being a slave to the past and leaving it behind to forge your own destiny and that's a great them, and yet TLJ and the ST firmly use the Original Trilogy's imagery to attract fans and as the setting for the story.  There's Stormtroopers, Death Stars, X-Wings, TIE fighters, Star Destroyers, Rebel Flagships, Rebel jumpsuits, and so on.  The story of the ST is that the First Order, an Imperial remnant organization, has grown in strength in the Unknown Regions and now opposes the Resistance, a guerrilla organization secretly funded by the New Republic.  They use the same weapons as the Empire and the Resistance by and large uses the same weapons and technology of the Rebels.  The main objective of the 3rd act of *The Force Awakens* is to destroy Starkiller Base, which is called out as being \"another Death Star\".  Right away fans called out TFA for being a rehash of *A New Hope* and pointed out the similarities to ANH with a ragtag Resistance (Rebels) facing a seemingly dominate First Order (Empire), a desert orphan Rey (Luke) being the new Chosen One of the franchise, and so on.  But many people who were fans of TFA said to give it time and pointed out differences between the conflicts of the ST and the OT.  Surely the sequel would differentiate the two conflicts.  And TLJ has been praised as reinvigorating the franchise and the reason why some people hate it is because it didn't cater to their theories.\n\nBut if you look at the overarching story, the similarities to the OT only become stronger.  The First Order now is said to \"reign\" and we're informed that soon they'll control all the galaxy's major systems, quickly leading them to have the same status and authority as the Empire whereas the New Republic has been destroyed and the Resistance is left without support, making them closer to the Rebellion of the OT.  And near the end, both Resistance members and First Order members refer to it as the Rebellion.  So while TLJ made interesting choices with the interpersonal relationships of the cast; Kylo kills Snoke, Kylo and Rey are in love, Luke in exile, etc, it's overarching story and imagery is very much a slave to the OT.  And even its points of deviation tread well-worn paths.  \"The Force can come from anyone\", the vast majority of the Jedi and Sith came from random families: Kenobi, Mace Windu, Yoda, Sidious, Maul, Ahsoka Tano...all of these people come from non-Force Sensitive families and don't have a legacy to live up to.  Rey herself is not a normal Force Sensitive but has been chosen by the Force to oppose the dark side, she's another Chosen One.  TLJ hints at true change when Luke goes to burn the tree containing the Jedi books and Yoda does it for him, but then the books are revealed to be safe in the Millenium Falcon and Luke says that he won't be the last Jedi.  The single most ballsiest thing the franchise could do and it chickens out.\n\nSo I find it very interesting and frustrating that people are praising the TLJ for being so bold when in actuality, it doesn't really take the story in any place we haven't seen before.  It seems hypocritical to on the one hand, make the story of TFA so closely mirror that of ANH's and use the excuse that it's the analogy of what would happen if Nazis in Argentina were able to restart the Third Reich, and then on the other denigrate the fans for being suckered in by nostalgia when the story of the ST banks so heavily on it.\nWhat am I missing that the critics who praise this movie see?  What are your thoughts on the Sequel Trilogy's originality and its use of nostalgia?  Is it being hypocritical or not?\n",

Those art forms allow people to hold onto tangible and physical representations whereas performance art is noticeably fleeting and transient. \n\nIt got me thinking about cinema and its origins. In the early days of cinema, enthusiasts could only watch films via cinemas. If you didn't go to the cinema, you couldn't watch the film. If you didn't manage to catch the film during its theatrical run, that was it. \n\n**You missed your opportunity.**\n\nWhereas now; with video-on-demand, Blu-ray / DVD, and torrents, you can rewatch your favorite films anytime. I must say, I am very much a romantic when it comes to this aspect of cinema. I like the idea of the fleeting cinematic experience. \n\nOne of my favorite cinematic experiences in the last few years was watching Dunkirk on 70MM IMAX. Because even though I knew it would be released on disc / online, there was a very good chance I would not be able to watch the film in that capacity again. That made the experience ephemeral to me. \n\nIf I missed the theatrical release at IMAX and simply watched it on DVD or online, I would be watching 50% of the film.\n\nI'm not the one to enjoy binge-watching on Netflix or any kind of DVD. I love the idea going to the cinema as I hate watching films on my laptop. I want the biggest screen possible. \n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker myself, I have thought extensively of ways I would make my future films more ephemeral. \n\nI play with the idea of releasing films only theatrically. Every so often hosting a Livestream of the film online and that's it. I like the idea of reducing the accessibility to increase the ephemera. Obviously, this is the kind of stunt you can only really do when you're a household name. \n\nSo, is this now a futile exercise against the dominant on-demand culture or will the value of cinematic ephemerality be affirmed in the future?",

Of course, the Oscars have become a lot more superficial and showy in the past decade, so I try to take them with a grain of salt. That being said, I guess that the Shape of Water winning best picture just solidifies how dumb the Oscars are getting. \n\nI don't even think this movie should have been nominated. I mean seriously? First, I'll start with the things I liked about the movie. The set design and cinematography were really well done and complimented each other perfectly and the soundtrack was a really good way to add to the movie. Now, for what I don't like about it, which is pretty much everything else. First of all, Michael Shannon's character as the villain is a character we've seen countless times before. He's the classic villain, who is inherently evil for no actual reason, has some sort of weird vice (the candy) and says extremely cheesy lines, just for the sake of driving the point home on how eeeeviiiil he is. Seriously, his dialogue is so cliche and overplayed. For example, I can't remember who he says this to but he literally tells someone that he will destroy them and in one of the last scenes, just after shooting the Russian scientist, he starts talking nonsense about how he likes to eat his candy. I mean, we've seen this dozens of times before. This character is so stale and overdone. \n\nNext, I think the whole plot in general is overdone. We've seen stories about a woman falling in love with some sort of \"ugly beast\" before. It's fine if a movie has a storyline that has been done before, as long as it includes new ideas and has some sort of twist that sets it aside from its competitors. But the Shape of Water had nothing. It didn't try to tell a new tale or teach the audience something different. It did everything that Beauty and the Beast has already done. The storyline is extremely predictable and boring. I did like the ending, I thought it wrapped everything up nicely and was a bit different than I expected, but it wasn't enough to save the rest of the movie. It was fairly obvious how the plot was going to drive forward. \n\nI hate that this won Best Picture and I hate what the Oscars have become. This movie was so stale. It had potential and I think GDT is a good storyteller but it wasn't enough to win Best Picture, or at least it shouldn't have been. It's just so sad how this won. It makes me so angry. \n\n",

The perspective jumps suddenly close to eerie faces in ambiguous context.  \"Wow, what genre is this!?\" Mr. Sarcasm thinks.\n\nMainstream film is pocked with this kind of formulaic, spoonfed exposition that treats atmosphere and context as little more than garnishment on the story.  And even this much effort is often considered the province of the \"prestige\" film: The more ordinary offerings default to something closer to TV establishing shots - an image of the Eiffel Tower slowly rotating in perspective with the words \"Paris, France\" helpfully spelled out letter by letter below the image.\n\nThat especially speaks to the intelligence and sophistication of the expected audience: They're outright stating that there is a danger that a substantial portion of the audience would not recognize the Eiffel Tower, would not know what city it's in, or knowing the city, would not know what country that city is in.  And even more exhausting, the implication is that if they don't show the words of the location being typed out, audience attention will fail to notice them.\n\nViewers who are infrequent or purely entertainment oriented will see nothing wrong with these practices, but if you are a regular viewer, they become a grating source of irritation that seems to badly insult audience intelligence and appear as a crutch that frees the filmmaker from building an atmosphere through the story.  Instead they just throw in some standard \"location shibboleths\" (or their era versions) and let the audience supply their own formulaic associations.\n\nFor most purposes, this is not a very big problem.  But for a film whose entire raison d'etre is exploring some other time and place, some adventure through strange experiences, the reliance on these tropes becomes paradoxically *stronger*.  Prestige films set in the past are so often rigidly-structured, with unfamiliar things spoonfed to audiences (if they aren't just ignored altogether) like some kind of medication schedule rather than just *showing* people another world and letting its richness speak for itself.\n\nFilms set in the *future* are even worse on this aspect.  Instead of just letting life unfold in a wondrously exotic context, movies constantly treat it like some kind of infomercial, shoving silly gadgets and zero-credibility dialogue in your face to inform you of the world you've stepped into rather than just *showing* it organically.\n\nIs exposition ultimately an act of laziness by filmmakers?  Does it build contextual Potemkin Villages so that incurious audiences will feel more secure and less challenged while sacrificing otherwise enormous potential for brilliant storytelling and immersive environments?\n\nWhat would be some examples of films that take the hard way of minimal exposition, and reward their audiences richly for the risks they take?",

        "text": "Just watched Annihilation. Immersive audio visual narrative experience. \n\nI think the film purposefully plays less on exposition on key plot elements. This may come across a bit too open for interpretation or conversely plot incoherence.  Haven’t read the book, btw...just guessing by the editing choices that were made. \n\nThe film could’ve probably worked on its own as a straight horror/ adventure if you take out Kane-Lena relationship and have a different but reasonable backstory to Lena. But then probably not so different than most other genre films out there. \n\nScreenplay choices like Dr. Ventress’ dialog about destroying a happy marriage (smartly embedded within the extended speech on self-destruction), Lena’s adultery and Kane’s video footage make for a very economic storytelling. Genetic evolution, cancer metaphor, mutation and duality take the picture to another level. I felt like the film explored philosophical aspects of evolution (of biological life in general) and the existential nature of human beings in a compelling way. While at the same time leaving a lot unexplained. Somewhere during the middle, I wondered why the film had to use the flashback device but it kinda made sense at the credits given how much it was packing in. \n\nSound and visual design are some of the best I have seen in last few years. Not just on their own but in the context of the film’s mise-en-scene. That is some craftsmanship to immerse an audience (at least me) like that. Within the genre Annihilation will stand alongside Under the Skin and Arrival for me. In terms of a sense of authorship, in addition to the aforementioned two movies others like Upstream Color, LoveSong, Spring Breakers, A Ghost Story, The Lobster and Personal Shopper come to mind. These were some new film watching experiences from the last few years. \n\n",

        "text": "I recently saw this film and having never read the book, it caught me by surprise and I didn't know if I liked it or not. Natalie Portman's acting left something to be desired. Certain parts reminded me of “Under the Skin,” the original “Alien” (especially some Giegeresque production design in the lighthouse basement towards the end) and Barry Levinson's “Sphere.” In the climax scene, the ominous melody right before the near-deafening music reminded me of Atoms for Peace's Ingenue. I was constantly taken out of the movie by how carelessly unprotected the different characters were when they interacted with the world of the Shimmer (something that was complained about time and again in Prometheus and Covenant).\n\nStill, I felt that these were gripes about things that didn't *seem* essential to the story. Was it supposed to be more allegorical than a typical alien thriller? I thought so, mainly because I think Alex Garland makes intelligent movies. I then read somewhere that the Shimmer represents cancer, and it finally started to make sense.\n\nThe all-female cast also struck me as interesting and noteworthy. Why were there no men in this expedition? Was it an answer to the need for stronger roles for women in cinema, or was it something more? I kept mulling over this and then I thought that since this was a movie about cancer and its effects on its host, the entire story had to be an abstraction of some kind.\n\nToday it occurred to me that the story could be a representation of the interactions within an all-women cancer support group. Dr. Ventress is the support group's leader. Her top priority is to reach the lighthouse at all costs, instead of studying the minute effects of cancer on the daily lives of the group. The lighthouse guides ships to safety through storms, much like reason guides our thoughts through times of emotional tribulation. Within the lighthouse of reason, a cancer patient is faced with a choice: Either retain their identity, or become a shell of their former self--recognizable to others on the outside, but alien on the inside.\n\nThe support group members confide in one another, support and defend one another, and mourn when they lose each other. After Lena hides the fact that Kane was her husband and is exposed by Anya, they feel betrayed--much like a person who has exposed all their vulnerabilities to you would feel if you didn't reciprocate. \n\nSome of the group's members go quietly, while others fight. Some struggle with what things mean, while others see the beauty in how their sickness makes them see the world. The different monsters in the world of the Shimmer represent the different types of cancer. When one of their team members is killed by the bear, the beast's growl takes on the sound of their friend screaming in pain (an ingenious moment in cinema). This is because whenever they come across this particular type of cancer, they remember their friend's suffering from it.\n\nAt the end, when Lena refuses to surrender to the emotional threat of cancer (in the form of the alien) that has come to annihilate her very being, she has maintained her reason and identity, but has gained no further understanding of the function or physical ramifications of cancer. She can only understand how it affected her on an emotional and rational level, and having traveled the journey, she can finally understand what her husband has gone through.\n\nEDIT: Some spelling / syntax errors.\n",

        "text": "Lost in translation\n\n\nWhat is a translation? The passage of meaning expressed in a language to another. What is lost in translation? The nuances and meanings that for one reason or another are lost in the re-expressed equivalent.\n\n\nOur characters are lost in a place that is alien to their customs and language. The hustle and bustle of the Japanese metropolis is foreign to the eastern temple and philosophy.  It is the chaos and non-sense of a culture born from the translation of the west to Japan. But the film is not only about two fellow compatriots that, being alone in the alien multitude, find each other. What happens in the outside is repeated in their inside. They bring from home the feeling of being lost inside themselves, of being strangers to their own being and of a profound lack of meaning. \n\n\nThis way, our protagonists, lost and confused regarding what they are and what they want to be, find themselves lost in the unintelligible and foreign Tokyo. In the middle of a multitude of different but remarkably similar faces, their eyes meet, forging a bond that will be hard to break. It’s not the round and blue eyes that unite them: the rest of the Western characters serve to show us that what makes these two different is their boredom regarding the superficial monotony of their partners and a deep desire to find harmony and meaning in their lives. A song by Elvis Costello expresses the cry of this desire with the question: “What’s so funny about peace, love and understanding? How is it that something so obvious and simple as seeing the other as something more than an obstacle in your way is impossible in the non-sense of a city? How can it be that, in the place of the world where there are the most people, one can feel so alone? In this way they find the meaning that they seek in their caring for each other, in the feeling on which every meaning and truth is based: Love.  Who am I and where I am going are not questions that can be answered alone and without another. \n\n\nThis is an exceptional film, a romance that being fed up with the superficiality of the genre decides to truly deal with its theme. The film submerges itself in the space where words no longer reach, in the rest that is left by every attempt of communication. It’s impossible to make a perfect translation from a language to another but it’s also true that a perfect communication is impossible between those who share a language and a culture. The alienation they both suffer from their most intimate world is represented by the misunderstanding and lack of communication that exists between them and their partners. But also, in the internal dialogue within ourselves, in the intimacy where our past, present and future are defined and translated daily, we don’t have another tool other than language. \n\nI uploaded it to my philosophy and cinema blog so i'll leave the link in case someone is interested: https://onlinesein.blogspot.com.ar/\n",

        "text": "**SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\nI recently rewatched the film Good Time (2017) and believe there is a theme relating to the repeated refrences of abuse and neglect towards dogs within the film symbolizing the abuse and neglect felt from the main characters Connie and Nickolas Nikas.\n\nWithin the scenes where Connie is able to watch TV, he always changes the channel to NY1 to watch the news for updates on the coverage of his failed bank robbery that got his brother sent to jail. Before the news anchor talks about the robbery, he mentions two instances where dogs were abused. The first time he mentions dogs found from a dog fighting ring, and the second about dogs found extremely emaciated and neglected.\n\nConnie mentions to a teenager helping him out, Crystal, that he knows he was a dog in his past life, and that is why they love him so much. Also, when he is later at the security guard Dash's house hiding out, Dash's dog is friendly to him, and hostile to the person Connie mistakenly broke out of the hospital (Ray) instead of his brother Nickolas. When Connie tries to leave Dash's place, Ray attempts to stop him and gets attacked by the dog, saving Connie for a brief period before being arrested, and Ray drunkenly falling to his death while attempting to scale the facade of the building to escape.\n\nNickolas, in the beginning of the movie, mentions abuse from his Grandmother during a sentence interpretations exercise, and has immense anger towards her due to their difference of opinions on Connie (shown in the prision phone call scene).\n\nThe reason I mention all this is because I believe there is a correlation between the dogs abused by their caretakers and the brothers (Connie and Nickolas) abused by their grandmother. Both victims of this mistreatment will act instinctually to survive due to possible trauma experienced from those incidents, hence why it's possible Connie would want to rob a bank and escape Queens, N.Y for Virginia.\n\nI am very curious to discover if anyone else noticed this or thinks I am either onto something or just thinking too much about minor details.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/83rpuo/what_do_filmmakers_have_to_say_about_religious_or/",
        "text": "*Firstly let me preface this by apologizing in advance for my english (I'm not a native speaker) and for the length of my post (I can already predict it's going to be too long and not well constructed), but I thought it was worth giving it a shot. Maybe some of you will have interesting ideas to share, I'm not too sure where I'm going with this post (despite trying to collect my thoughts before opening this page, I promise) but I thought maybe this would generate an interesting in-depth discussion.* \n\nSo, I'm a Frenchie and one of the topics that filled the news/public and political debate here (and abroad) in recent years was obviously terrorism and islamist radicalization. It's still quite present although things have calmed down in the last year or so: we are now back to a kind of \"normalcy\" after several years during which this was heavily debated, reaching the point of \"overdose\" in my opinion... (ie: interesting debates, useful ones of course, but after a while it felt void, everything seemed to have already been said -and the admission that there is no magic answer to such a complex issue seemed to be some sort of taboo). So what can cinema provide, when trying to make sense of it all? What do films have to say about the topic? \n\nFrench filmmakers have tackled this subject many times already - which I think is quite remarkable compared to other historical or societal events about which they waited several years before making films about them (although I may be wrong, I'm not a very knowledgeable cinephile). That's what I'd like to explore with you, if you have stimulating ideas to share? What films come to your mind, which ones do you think are the most interesting? Which genre or angle do you find the most compelling? What kind of film do you think needs to be made 'right now' and it is maybe different from the ones that will be made (/ought to be made) in about a decade? Also, which ones have been made in your country? And how do they relate to one another? What does it say about the cultural differences, different ideologies, different media treatment maybe, depending on each country/continent, its History and specific current societal and political context?\n\nAs I said, French filmmakers have been quite prolific in the past few years: there have been films about religious radicalization (some very closely linked to these real contemporary events, others tackling these themes more indirectly), but also several films which were interested in \"today's youth\" to put it broadly, and reflected on what political ideology, political activism looks like nowadays, what it stems from, etc. Or about a *lack* of ideology, a sense of void, of disillusionment, of helplessness, or anxiety about the future, boredom... (which can be linked to some form of radicalization. Or not. And is often linked to a critic of today's economy, consumerism and deshumanization). \n\n[Nocturama](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4795546/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (thriller) is in my opinion one of the most interesting French films released recently. Although it does not stem from the recent terrorist attacks by ISIS fighters, it echoed something broader that seems to have indeed been stirring up in the last decade and is not only reserved to a minority of crazy/lost individuals, or to France?\n\nAnother film I quite liked was [Les Anarchistes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4466336/?ref_=nv_sr_3): I don't think it's a coincidence this film about young anarchists in 1899 Paris was made and released in 2015, as France was seeing some of its youth embracing the Califate, while others were creating \"[Nuit Debout](https://www.humanite.fr/sites/default/files/images/nuit_debout_0.jpg)\" (= major social protests since many years. Occuring although the government was left-wing). \n\n[Love at First Fight/Les combattants](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3204144/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (comedy/romance/thriller), about a young woman who undergoes military training because she is convinced the end of the world is close, also isn't a coincidence I think and questions the current life prospects of the young generation nowadays. \n\n[The Disintegration](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1920984/?ref_=nv_sr_2) (drama), released *before* the Charlie Hebdo attack, perfectly predicted what was about to come and how the process of religious/political radicalization operates. \n\n[Heaven will wait](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5766118/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (drama) tried to explore the process of radicalization from the point of view of a young female teen whose choices partly stemed from a romantic fantasy. (Not a very interesting film: took things \"at face value\" too much I think). Similarly [Les Cowboys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4228294/?ref_=nv_sr_2) focused on the family of a young teenage girl who joined ISIS abroad: a drama about their quest to find her and understand what they missed. \n\n[The Workshop](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6444838/?ref_=nv_sr_1), released a few months ago tackles these issues on a more intellectual level since it's a drama (/thriller, sort of) about an author who does a workshop with young people: descendants of immigrants and a troubled white guy radicalized online by a far right 'guru'. \n\nOne thing I'd like to note is that, in this film, this disturbing young far-right guy is shown looking at himself (his muscles) in the mirror and I think there needs to be more films focusing on the \"sensorial\" aspect of things (I mean by that that sexuality is a theme: masculinity, body image nowadays with all the commercial images we're bombarded with etc...- I  think female directors should maybe be  more able to explore these aspects: the way in which body and soul/thoughts relate to one another when focusing on young characters who decide to act as some kinds of 'freedom' soldiers or activists of many sorts). [The Stopover](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4699444/?ref_=nv_sr_1) was a bit like that (drama about two young female soldiers), and the fact that [Neither Heaven Nor Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4426656/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (a drama/fantasy about male soldiers' realization that their job is senseless) was also relesed recently is again to me an interesting thing to note. Young people, fighting, for ideas/ideals, only to realise it's all BS... there's a reoccuring theme in many of these films. Kind of metaphysical: Where to find sense in life nowadays? What does spirituality mean? What about politics? What is worth fighting for? How? How do we reconnect to our young bodies? To our sexuality? \n\n(There were other films released in France quite recently which could also illustrate all these themes, but I'll stop there. No comedies though. Or only a handful which were not really memorable or particularly efficient in this area). And, interestingly I think, there have also been many films that focused on the criticism of working conditions, but these follow a long tradition and seem to be quite disconnected to everything I just wrote about. (I seems to me that there are  on the one hand social dramas with adult characters struggling at work, and on the other hand more original films of various genres that focus on young characters and their psyche? I know you could probably argue that's always been the case... but I just feel like there's a big wall: adults and teens/young adults don't seem to connect in films, and I wonder if it doesn't say something about the reality: young people feeling like they aren't being integrated into society by the baby boomer generation?) I think there's a need for films that explore the juncture between professional and personal life (and, again, I think young female directors may be more well suited to achieve this, by exploring new genres).\n\nSo, now that I've listed all of these, what about directors elsewhere? Young directors are emerging, what do they have to say about this generation? What themes are you noticing? How do they all connect, or not?\n\n[Finally, how do you think filmmakers will tackle the Trump election? Or what are you hoping to see, if anything? (Not a day goes by without a comment chain on /r/politics about how the election or Mueller investigation will be treated by film directors or series showrunner. I don't doubt there will be several good \"biopic\" kinds of projects, probably very soon, but aren't you also hoping for more distantiated ones? Instead of something close to a documentary I mean. Comedies will be made I'm sure, but I'd like a fictional drama about today's youth in America: be it neo-nazis or liberal anti-gun activists types of characters. I feel like this generation craves it)].\n\n\n(I warned you about the lengthy post. If that's just badly worded and confusing, I apologize).",

        "title": "Lady Bird as a Christian fable about coming home?",
        "author": "therewasamoocow",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/83rdyl/lady_bird_as_a_christian_fable_about_coming_home/",
        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI was reading the post about Christian \"evangelical\" art and its low quality, and it got me thinking about whether I had seen a good Christian movie lately. I realized that I had seen one this year, *Lady Bird.* None of the reviews I have read seemed to pick up on the movie's Christian themes, focusing almost entirely (and justifiably) on the mother-daughter relationship. But the movie in general had the arc of a Christian redemptive fable: someone runs astray from family and God, leaves home, realizes how much God and her family mean to her, and finally comes \"home\" in some sense of the word. Lady Bird is rebellious and defiant the entire movie, but cannot help but love her hometown of Sacramento, and by extension her Catholic school. She then goes off to New York for college against the wishes of her mother, where she proceeds to drink too much and winds up in the hospital. The very next morning she goes to church, and calls her parents and tells them (essentially) she loves them and that they were right. It's not necessarily a Christian story in the sense of \"coming to Jesus,\" but it is Christian in the sense of being loyal to one's family and home. \n\nI expect any film-conscious viewer of *Lady Bird* would have picked up its theme of filial piety. But it's important to see how inseparable that theme is from Catholicism, simply by virtue of how drenched this film is in Catholic imagery--there is a reason Ronan's character goes to a Catholic private school, dresses in a Catholic schoolgirl uniform, eats Eucharist wafers, interacts with nuns, and goes to a Catholic church at the end of the movie (heck, the movie poster has old-timey Bible manuscript lettering and a cross in the background). It's also important to recognize the movie as a traditional, moral fable. This is not immediately obvious because Ronan is presented in such a sympathetic manner. She is not judged for having sex or drinking, but is rather recognized as a repressed, angsty teenager with a difficult mother (something most people can relate to). The movie starts to moralize only when Ronan herself realizes the importance of home--when she gets homesick in New York, drinks too much, and leaves the hospital for church. And when I say moralize, I don't mean that the movie is looking down on the \"sins\" Ronan committed--I mean that it presents home, family, and yes, Christianity, in a rarefied light. \n\nIf I haven't totally lost you, I'd also like to remark on how this movie fits into our conception of explicitly \"Christian\" movies, almost all of which in contemporary America are awful. The other post remarked on how these movies are bad because they are aimed at a Protestant evangelical audience wanting to hear that they are persecuted and that the rest of the world is evil. I think that's largely correct, if simplified. What separates *Lady Bird* artistically is (1) it's connected to Catholicism, not evangelical American Protestantism, and (2) it is subtle in its Christian redemptive message, wrapping it up in a mother-daughter story that we can all identify with. It doesn't beat us over the head with anything about Christ or sin. It simply sends the troubled main character to church and has her call her parents. You can choose to view Lady Bird's decision to go to church as just her going somewhere that reminded her of home, but I think it's clear that there is a religious connotation to it. \n\nThoughts? Did anyone else catch this, or do you think I'm off the rails here?\n",

        "text": "I'm sure many of you here, being internet literate, will be aware of the Ugandan \"Supa Action\" movie \"Who Killed Captain Alex\", the hilarious OTT action movie that became a viral hit online back in 2010. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can view the infamous trailer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BymeLkZ7GqM\n\nSo I finally published an article I have been working on for months, explaining why I believe this is the most important African Film of the century so far, which you can read at https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2018/03/who-killed-captain-alex-most-important-film/\n\nWould love to get your thoughts on my work, but to summarize:\n\n- The film's release strategy and genre overcomes the issues that have held back African Cinema for decades- poor distribution &amp; exhibition models; a lack of resources for education, preservation and restoration of Africa's film history; and not tackling the outside world's indifference to what African Cinema was producing\n\n- The film spearheads what I consider to be the third phase of African Cinema, and thus it is an \"announcement\" film in the same way as Moonlight, Killer of Sheep and Black Girl (La Noire De...) as a film that breaks new ground\n\n- My rough, self-defined three phases of African Cinema are 1963-1993 (a period of mostly political cinema, produced during a time when Africa was becoming independent from colonialism, film production was being nationalized and Pan-Africanism was becoming prominent); 1993-2010 (films that were becoming more about reflection and tackling questions of African identity); and 2010 onwards, where we see African Cinema evolving but still being watched and discovered by a very small amount of people, which includes African audiences.\n\n- The film is the first from Africa to really understand and exploit the potentials of internet culture, and the democratic nature of the internet as a platform for independent film. It is a genre film, unlike any seen before in African Cinema, and as previously mentioned in my article about Black Panther and African Cinema, these types of films transcend cultural boundaries and tend to succeed at the international box office. Nabwana's film sets an example more African filmmakers should follow- Cinema can only get so far by making high art and not mainstream entertainment\n\n- Isaac Nabwana, the film's director, used the film to begin developing his own entire film industry. He capitalized on the chinese influence on his personal filmmaking style to begin a relationship with China, and unlike any other African filmmaker has broken ground with the world's largest film market. This is especially notable as China is so heavily invested in Africa, for better or worse, but this has yet to extend to a deep relationship between the cinematic cultures\n\n- Finally, I address that criticism can be made at my article, that I am praising the film and calling it the most important African film of this century because I am approaching it all in a Western state of mind- that I believe it's important because it adheres to what I am used to as a Westerner in terms of structure and relating to Western films. However, I argue that this is partially unavoidable, but also that a film like \"Who Killed Captain Alex?\" can fix the problems preventing more Africans being exposed to their own cinematic heritage, which in turn would create more African filmmakers, and more African perspectives on this subject, so the whole conversation about African Cinema can be more defined on Africans' terms. A film like \"Who Killed Captain Alex?' opens African Cinema up to the world, and crucially to more African audiences and future filmmakers.\n\nAnyway, this has been on my mind for months and I'm glad to get my thoughts out there. Would love to hear what people have to say about the subject and my argument.\n",

When Ventriss dissolves and the alien \"reveals\" itself, it is a blob of mass that is akin to an optical illusion, making it hard to discern what it even is. This was a brilliant visual decision. You could theorize that the chamber where the alien is discovered is the alien itself: large, amorphous, Eldritch looking... Thing...\n\n\nThe alien has an effect on the world just by existing which is a strong trope in lovecraftian horror: people are driven mad, disease spreads and mutations occur. In Colour Out of Space, the colour actually does mutate and radiate the environment around it as its shimmer spreads, which is identical to the events of Annihilation.\n\n\n\nPlot wise, it's a pretty standard mystery where a group of people enter hostile territory and slowly uncover the truth and nature of what it is their dealing with. This is done through past recordings (the video tape) and deducing the nature of things using their intellect.\n\n\n\nUltimately the fear of the unknown takes hold and our understanding of the alien and its form is practically non existent which causes characters to die and lose their mind, a true Lovecraftian trope.

I want to hear from people that love the film (basically everybody). I have not edited or proofread it since I originally wrote it and there is stuff that has gotten a really negative reaction on the other post. I'm not interested in editing things to make myself look better, so this post has been copied verbatim.\n\nI love movies.\n\nThe first distinct memory I have of watching a movie - I know that I must have watched movies before this, but I don’t remember them - is December of 1999. I was four years old, sitting on the floor of my living room in front of my tiny box set, when the words “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away….” appeared on the screen. It was Star Wars. Yellow words, stars, a pan down, a moon that looked like ours, then suddenly another moon, and then a giant planet that looked like sand. A big, big ship. Something’s shooting at it. Then a ship appears, so monstrous it made the big ship look like a Mini Cooper in comparison, so impossibly huge that it was in three corners of the screen at once. That shot, that moment, changed my life forever. In fact, I think it’s nearly my first memory. The only thing I know for sure happened before that was that I fell down the stairs of my basement once when I was three.\n\nIn nearly 20 years since, I have seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of 4,000 films. That’s a little bit less than half the number of days I’ve been alive. I go to the theater 15-20 times a year. About half those times I will be seeing just one movie. Others I will see two or three. This past Boxing Day, I saw five films in the span of 12 hours. I don’t go to see every film that comes out, as I do have to have some level of interest - a relatively easy thing to do as my tastes are massively varied - in order to dedicate my two hours to something. I don’t think I could compare myself to someone like Ebert, who probably easily saw 100+ movies every year whether he was interested in every one or not. But I have still seen probably more films than most people see in two lifetimes.\n\n2017 is, to me, one of cinema’s absolute landmark years the way something like 1974 is. Of my all-time top 100 films, which is out of thousands, 2017 currently owns ten of those spots, including #2 (Blade Runner 2049). I adore so many of the films that came out in the last 12 months. There are films like the aforementioned 2049, Logan, Lady Bird, Call Me by Your Name, Dunkirk, even The Post; which have all unlocked new things for me as a filmgoer and a lover of talking about cinema.\n\nSo, enter The Florida Project. I hated that I missed this one in theaters. I got earfuls from people about needing to see it. It was in EVERY. SINGLE. TOP. TEN. LIST. It was by all accounts one of THE essential films from an essential year. Plus it apparently had career-best work from one of my favourite actors who has ever lived. I finally watched it the other night. I was so goddamn excited to cross off one of my final 2017 films, the one on the top of my list. And with all that said and done…\n\nI hated it.\n\nNo, seriously, I despise this movie. It completely blows my mind how terrible it is, and the overwhelming positive reception as if this film is the Citizen Kane of the 21st century is the most confusing thing ever to me. I have hated movies before. I have seen lots of terrible movies that made me feel robbed of my time. I have certainly seen films that are cinematic sewage, that have no writing or characters or story or direction or acting or quality. The Florida Project might technically be better than, say, Sharknado, but despite that - hell, despite the fact that the movie even has a wealth of good in it - I think it’s the worst movie I’ve ever seen if my metric for ranking films is a cross between judged cinematic worth and how little the movie made me feel like my time was wasted.\n\nBut let’s get into the positives first before I talk about the things that detonated this film for me.\n\nIt does absolutely no fucking around in telling us who its’ characters are. All the kids, Grandma, Halley, Ashley, Bobby… their first scenes all without question tell us who these people are and how they will behave for the next hour and a half. I will always respect a screenplay that does that.\n\nThere’s gold in the dialogue. The “this is my favourite tree” line that has been discussed a billion times deserves every bit of praise. The cinematography is similarly pretty much uniformly brilliant - there are some fucking WONDERFUL shots in this film - up until a certain point that I’m going to talk about when I get to the negatives. I think my favourite moment visually was when Bobby lit his cigarette at the same moment the hotel lights came on. I don’t often care for symbolism but the parallel that this man is a beacon of light for this building and its’ residents was great.\n\nSpeaking of Bobby, Dafoe is BY FAR the greatest thing about this film. There’s a phenomenal short feature hidden inside this movie if you take ONLY the scenes that have Willem Dafoe in them. The drama between him and Caleb Landry Jones is amazing, but is damaged by the fact that it does nothing to complement the remainder of the film and instead is great only on its’ own terms. He is what kept me watching every time I reached to turn the film off. Him pulverizing the pedophile’s soul is great. Him putting Hallee in her fucking place is fantastic. Him telling his security guy not to let people get run over in the parking lot is legitimately maybe the best moment in the entire film.\n\nSimilarly, the little girl who played Moonee, Brooklynn Prince, is fantastic. It’s incredible that she’s only what, six? She comes across to me like the girl version of myself when I was six, idealistic and happy despite living in a broken world that had already rubbed off on me in the most subtly terrible ways. The scene of her sobbing in front of Jancey is heart-rending and I think it’s fine to consider the Oscars to have snubbed her. Between Millie Bobby Brown, Dafne Keen and now this little girl, we have a trio of VERY young actresses who, if they all continue into adulthood, will create a new dynasty of actresses who will dominate the landscape of cinema.\n\nAnd finally there are some visual storytelling things that I love. Number one being of course the multiple scenes of Moonee bathing where you slowly key into what’s actually happening each subsequent time.\n\nSo, the bad? Well… I hate the scene transitions and most of the storytelling. I fucking hate films that are just a random series of vignettes. That’s what I watch documentaries and Koyaanisqatsi for. When I watch a fictional movie I’m here to watch a set of characters progress because of a series of events. Instead what the movie does is begin its’ plot two thirds of the way through and hammer you over the head with how abruptly it happens, and that’s after over an hour of mostly random shit. I really like how the film jump cuts within certain scenes, like how Halley and Bobby are arguing down the walkway but then all of a sudden it cuts and they’ve descended two flights of stairs. It reminds me of Breathless. I just wish the structure of the movie wasn’t handled the same way. In reality what’s the only way you get down a flight of stairs that instantly? By falling down them. That’s what this movie felt like. I know firsthand, remember?\n\nIt doesn’t know whose story it wants to tell. This movie isn’t Magnolia. It isn’t telling nine stories and then having them interlink in a satisfying, rewarding way at the film’s conclusion. Who is the main character? Oh it’s Moonee? Then why the fuck did Bria Vinaite get half the fucking screentime? Why are multiple scenes devoted to the drama between Bobby and his son as if something will come of it? If this movie is supposed to be about Moonee then it should have been a movie about Moonee. Just because it includes random one-off scenes like her and the kids laughing at the redheaded lady bathing topless does not make it a movie about Moonee.\n\nThe condo arson really pisses me off. It was presented as the real “kickoff” point of the film only to have no consequences whatsoever. Yeah, it prompts Ashley to be obscure in cutting off Halley, but that to me is bullshit too. And that ties into my next point.\n\nThe manufactured drama. Even Moonee running away at the end only happens because the child care workers AND police officers AND (maybe) even fucking Bobby act like buffoons. The only reason I’ll let that one slide is because the film avoided the Antoine Fuqua-level cheap drama bullshit cliche where she gets hit by a car or something. Ashley being mysterious towards Hallee about wanting her to stay away from Scooty is probably the biggest example of manufactured tension, but the scene with the Middle Eastern motel owner refusing Bobby’s money just to force Halley to go to Grandma’s place at The Future is worse. As if this woman running a shitty motel in buttfuck nowhere Florida is going to refuse making easy money. Why didn’t the movie just make Grandma’s place the first destination for Halley to go to if only to spare me one less fucking scene of Halley being a whiny bitch.\n\nThat’s the biggest problem I have with this movie. Halley. Fucking Halley. The story goes that Bria Vinaite was chosen for this film because Sean Baker found her on Instagram. Yeah, I could believe it. If you told me she was plucked off a street corner and then had a camera pointed at her I would believe you. She cannot act. There is nothing natural about her performance. It is stilted and forced and robotic and the worst part is that she acts no different in real life. But whatever. I can get over a bad performance if the writing is strong, which is great because the writing’s strong, right?\n\nWrong. The writing for Halley is absolute shit. She spends two hours whining and screaming and swearing and being a terrible person and doing reprehensible things, and yet the movie wants you to support her. Sean Baker made this movie through a lens of objectivity? The movie only wants you to observe and then pick your own side? Bullshit. I can practically hear him pleading with me to be compassionate towards Halley. All that was gone by the time the fucking awful diner scene came along. Whatever iota was left evaporated the second she destroyed all that food after having just spent five minutes of the film making a poor waitress (Ashley) feel like garbage at work, pissing away the money she’s supposed to use for rent, just because the waitress decided she didn’t want her son playing with Halley’s daughter anymore.\n\nAlready I hated this character, not in the way that I hate Nurse Ratched because she’s a brilliant villain, but in the way that I hate Lisa from The Room because she’s a piece of shit who the movie expects me to empathize with. And THEN she stormed into Ashley’s motel room and beat her senseless because of HER OWN CHOICES. I don’t care if she loves Moonee - and does she? Or does she just love the control she has? - or how many times she takes her running out in the rain. She’s a garbage mom and a garbage human. And there’s no payoff to that. We just get to see her be a bitch for the entire runtime.\n\nHowever, that seems sort of balanced, right? This movie would never have made my top ten for the year or anything, but Halley aside, there are parts of this film, moments, that I loved. And now we get to the ending, which really to me is incredibly ballsy and honestly had nearly fixed this film for me. Bobby hearing the confrontations revolving around Moonee and NOT stepping in, NOT being the savior, NOT doing what every other Hollywood character similar to him has ever done, blew my mind. And Moonee sobbing at her friend’s doorstep, her childhood imploded, is dark, and sad, and true, and brilliant, and beautiful in a horrible way. And then the movie cuts to black, and I’m moved by what just happened.\n\nExcept that isn’t what happens. No. Instead we get the stupid fucking garbage we get, where suddenly this beautiful 35mm footage turns into a shitty cellphone video and this nonsensical run to and through Disneyland. People can keep arguing all they want that “he filmed all of Tangerine with an iPhone so it’s fine”, except that you’re stupid because TANGERINE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE. And yeah, I get it with the music and the cellphone that everything from the reverse shot of Jancey trembling onwards is a fantasy and inside Moonee’s head and her escape from her now ruined childhood. But the problem is, A: it’s bullshit and B: it doesn’t change anything. Her mother is still a piece of shit, she’s still being taken away, Grandma’s crappy kid has spilt food all over the bed, she’s broken down in tears, and the child care workers will find her in a few minutes and her future is now irreversibly, cataclysmically shifted. The final 60 seconds try to tell you “never mind any of that, here’s Disneyland!” Fuck that.\n\nWhen the film cut to black, I did a few things simultaneously. I jumped out of my seat. I threw my remote on the ground. I raised my arms in frustration. I screamed at the TV. I booed. Me, alone at 3 AM, in my living room, booed this movie. It offended me. I joke all the time about how Catwoman or Suicide Squad or Battlefield Earth or Freddy Got Fingered are “offensively bad” but this is the first and only time I have sincerely come out the other side of any film offended by its’ existence.\n\nBut I’m far more bothered by the disconnect between me and apparently every single other person who has seen The Florida Project than I could ever be by the film itself.\n\nWhy don’t I get this movie? What am I missing? Why am I seemingly the only person in the world who absolutely hated, hated, hated, hated The Florida Project? It has been three days since I watched it, and it is bothering me. It has been affecting my sleep. I haven’t been functioning at work. I have cried six different times thinking about it. The fact that I hate this movie makes me feel more alone, more of an outsider, than either my breakup or my social disorder ever have. I very sincerely despised this movie. It is not the first and already since is not the last time that has happened with a film for me, yet for some reason I am depressed about the fact that I hate this movie and yet no one else does.\n\nSo please help me. Help me understand why I should think this movie is the best drama since Schindler’s List. Or if I’m not wrong and you agree with me, please introduce yourself. Because for whatever reason, this film is tearing me apart. Not with desire to reevaluate the film, but with worry that I have shifted universes.",

        "text": "I was recently watching Cloud Atlas (that's a whole other thread) and one of the key subplots is genomics and the the ethics surrounding it, a subject of much interest to me. I was then reminded of Gattaca and promptly re-watched it.\n\nI was blown away. It's been a long time so I had forgotten how much I enjoy the film. It's simple and subtle. It does not demand your attention with a catchy or mesmerising soundtrack or colour scheme like Wes Anderson, or with witty dialogue like Tarantino films. Its just so subtle that you feel the need to pay close attention, like leaning in to listen to a person who speaks softly, but wisely. I think it is an appropriate style in this case, since the subject that is being tackled, genomics and ethics, is so big that you really need to rid yourself of distraction to mull it over. The dialogue is simple yet rich. This is kind of a lame metaphor, but it reminded me of the feeling of a basic New York cheese cake: simple, with surprisingly depth  requiring time to savour each bite. Whereas Cloud Atlas feels more like drinking from a firehose. And the tone of narration is so monotonous,  yet it works. \n\nAnd of course, the crescendo scene where Vincent is reunited with his brother, swimming out into the ocean. The exchange of words out in the stormy sea brings out an emotional reaction in all of us who ever had to fight a losing battle, or overcame prejudice, or cared about something or someone more than their own life. To swim into the darkness because there was no other option. And if you have any ambition in your heart, that scene calls to it.\n\nAnyway, that's how I felt after watching the movie.\n\nHow do others feel about Gattaca? Have I romanticized it too much? Are there other movies you would point me to in the same style, or on the same subject?\n\nThanks!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/83b7oi/spoilers_what_really_happened_in_shutter_island/",
        "text": "I just watched this excellent film and was really intrigued by the ending. I found many threads online claiming that their interpretation of the end was absolute, but there are still some small points that seem to disprove every theory. How did you guys really interpret the film? What do you think really happened? \n\nA couple of interesting points many people seem to miss:\n\n1. When Di Caprio wakes up in the first scene, there are handcuffs in the cabin, suggesting that he was chained.\n\n2. There are actually two different lighthouses.\n     - The first one we see is connected to the mainland by cliffs. We are told by the guards that this it is used for sewage treatment.\n     - The second one we see for the rest of the movie - it is not connected to land and Di Caprio swims across to it.\n\n3. The Rachel that Di Caprio finds in the cave is actually part of the 'role-play'\n     - She cannot be apart of his imagination because she starts an actual fire that actually makes Di Caprio feel warm and actually scares the rats out of the cave. She also gives him information that he could not have possibly known (stuff about science).\n     - She cannot be an escaped patient/doctor because she calls him Marshal.\n\n4. The toy gun the shrink breaks at the end was actually Chuck's (his 'partner'). We know this because Di Caprio doesn't hand over his holster at the start of the film while Chuck does.\n\n5. The bald shrink seems to know about Di Caprio's dreams: \"Why are you all wet baby?\"\n\n6. When Chuck calls out to Di Caprio at the end, he calls him 'Teddy' - not 'Andrew'.\n\n7. Chuck was smoking the same cigarettes as Di Caprio, so it is unlikely that they were drugged.\n\n8. On the other hand his vivid dreams happen right after being given 'advil'.\n\n9. The Conversation Di Caprio has with the lunatic in ward C suggests that they knew each other outside of the Island.\n\n10. I'm not certain about this point, but I believe that their conversation (Di Cpario and Lunatic) is taped, suggesting that the Doctors wanted it to occur.\n\n11. He instantly recognizes the lunatic, but no one else on the island. (I'm not sure if this really matters, or is just a part of his selective memory)\n\n12. Di Caprio never mentions having any children throughout the movie. The faces of his supposed sons are never shown, and his daughter is actually the girl he remembers from WWII.\n\n13. When talking to one of the shrinks he says \"I'll report over to ...\", and needs to be reminded that he reports to the FBI. On the other hand, he is fully aware of the MI5 and other intelligence agencies when talking to Chuck in the cemetery.\n\n14. Shutter Island is an anagram for Truth and Lies.\n\n\nThere seem to be two main theories about the movie: Teddy is Teddy (he is actually a martial that the doctors make insane to hide their unethical experiments), or Teddy is Andrew (he was insane the whole time and the doctors are trying to cure him, as it is in the book).\n\nI don't think the real story is so simple as the above points disprove both. \nWhen he says his final line (\"Is it better to live a monster or die a hero?\"), he could be referring to himself as a monster or he could be referring to the doctors as monsters. Regardless of the interpretation, it seems obvious that he chooses to die a hero.\n\nI read another theory that Teddy actually burned his house down and killed his wife, which is what made him go insane (the camera frequently focuses on him lighting matches). That is why he is brought to the island in handcuffs, and the rest of the movie is just an experiment by the doctors in a new way of treatment (implanting memories into the patient). While this theory fits best with the facts (except his conversation with the lunatic), it doesn't really seem to make much logical sense - why go through all this trouble for a simple experiment?\n\nThere are also other points about the movie that I just don't understand:\n\n1. We know Cave Rachel is fake per #3 above, what about the other Rachel?\n      - If Teddy is Teddy, then the other Rachel must be a real patient. If she isn't real, that means that they tricked him to onto the island, and the plan was to make him insane all along. In other words, they didn't trick him into insanity because he found out too much (while on the island), but because they specifically wanted to experiment on him - why???\n     - If Teddy is Andrew, I suppose this doesn't matter. She was probably another actress.\n \n2. Why does the German try to drug Di Caprio near the end?\n     - If Teddy is Teddy then they still need his confession before hurting him. That's why he isn't dead already.\n     - If Teddy is Andrew then it seems entirely counter-productive to end the fantasy at that point. I understand that he didn't want to do this to begin with, but he had numerous other opportunities to end the 'role-play'. Why stop it near the end?\n     - Thinking about this, he knows that Di Caprio has 'extraordinary defense mechanisms', so he might just be trying to scare him, but why? The bald shrink made sure he was going to the lighthouse anyway by tricking him that they were lobotomizing his partner (\"You don't have a partner\").\n\n3. My biggest problem with Teddy is Andrew: why are so many of the staff trying to antagonize him and plant conspiracies in his head (Chuck, Both Rachels, Lady who writes RUN)? Also, why is he introduced to the German? It seems like the staff were trying to make him go crazy, not make the whole situation seem preposterous (as they claim).\n\nAnyway, I'm curious as to what you guys think! Can you explain any of the above. Did it make you change your mind? Is there really a definitive version, or is the director just trying to make his movie seem deep :)",
