        "text": "I am a software engineer in Mexico. In my current company (transnational leader corporate) the title junior or mid doesn’t exist, so you only have Engineers, Senior Engineers, Lead, etc. Due to the current economic situation we have been told there is no money to expend in general to avoid having to layoff anybody in the worst case scenario. But after the end year review I’ve seen my Senior colleagues (under my manager but different projects) promoted to Leads, so now we don’t have any Seniors. \n\nI’m almost 1 year now at this company, and I have 3 years of experience. I don’t expect these roles will be fulfilled by hiring because the company is avoiding hiring altogether. And I have received really good feedback from my manger about my work (even mentioned that I have trained some seniors on technical matters), and I’m leading big work on the team as well. My lead is encouraging me to ask out manager to make me a Sr, he even refers to me as his senior at the daily meetings.\n\nWe have been getting a lot of investment due to nearshoring, and the OKRs for this year are promoting internal talent, so there’s also that.\n\nWhat could I do to convince my manager I’m a good fit for the senior position?",

I was let go for bad performance (after getting a great review, a proper blindside) and still struggling to understand exactly how I was labeled as such (with reflection I can say that I got a little behind on a deadline but I was being assigned higher priority stuff that I was completing and I was constantly context switching. I thought I was delivering a lot and was putting in long days and some weekends to get things done, but in a reasonable manner without completely killing myself, I think. Is work-life balance even real, ha). Still, it doesn’t make sense and I’ve really looked at my actions and tried to see how I could learn from this and what I could have possibly done wrong or differently. Still coming up empty and my former colleagues are confused as well. At this point, I’m trying to not be upset at what happened and just move on despite the huge blow and uncertainty around how much being fired has set me back in my career. \n\nAll that being said, in retrospect I should have negotiated and asked to be laid off instead, but I was too paralyzed by the sheer 180 in my reality. Overnight my boss and I went from having what I thought was a good relationship to one of complete judgement with him seeming almost giddy after giving me the axe.\n\nNow I’m here, trying to apply for new roles and I just don’t know what to say. I feel like I’m carrying a stink that I can’t wash off and I’m afraid that my chances for future employment will be severely impacted by the fact that I was fired and not laid off, especially with job market in its current state. What am I going to tell recruiters/hiring managers when they ask why I no longer work at my old gig? “Great question! I was fired/terminated/let go for being a bad performer but I promise that’s bs and I’m a great senior engineer! Hire me!” Ugh. It feels awful to even have to defend myself and I feel very low and unjustly labeled. My confidence is shot. It also sucks because I have almost 8 years of experience and was always a highly respected engineer who was known for their work quality and ethic. At previous companies I was also promoted and received bonuses pretty regularly based on my good performance, sigh. And although I have a good network, I don’t want to apply to roles my dev friends suggest because I don’t want to make them look bad for referring someone who’s been fired.  \n\nThis experience has done a number on my mental health at many levels and the timing is both a blessing and curse given the blood bath that’s been the tech scene as of late. How do I communicate this while applying/interviewing without shooting myself in the foot?\n\n**TLDR:** Got fired, don't agree with the reasons, how do I discuss this with potential employers?",

I've been talking to temp agencies and applying for low-pay 6 month contract-to-hire positions thinking it'd give me something to A. fill out the mostly blank experience section on my resume, B. Give me something to wait out the ugly market. But most of these temp agencies don't have anything for entry-level so they just ignore your calls and emails. I finally got an interview lined up for a $55,000 entry-level temp job. The interview goes well so I think great, finally, I'm going to get my break. Two weeks go by and I don't hear anything so I email the recruiter and ask what's up. Recruiter says the client went with a candidate who had multiple years of experience. A fucking candidate who should be going for a SE 2 or SE 3, is now applying for a fucking 55,000 temp job because the market is so fucked. \n\nI literally don't know what else to do.

These aren't insured beyond 250k per account which is a problem for companies who received millions of dollars and put it in said bank account. Now they may lose all of that money or at the very least have to wait quite some time to access that money.\n\nThis tweet explains more exactly what happened and why: https://twitter.com/jamiequint/status/1633956163565002752",

Where something as simple as an input box requires several functions to make work. What I'm doing feels pointless because the more I hack together solutions for this project the more that can break and I don't have anymore time. I been working nights and weekends and the more I add to this Gui the more I learn how many dead ends I am chasing. I don't have anyone to ask for help because no one else on my team does front end work and when I talk to my manager he told me \"own the code\", \"here a udemy course,\" and \"You have to be the expert on front end\". There no one else in my group because the last guy that I replace with 4 years experience left for another job and the rest of the team  specializes in other fields.

I've been so unhappy and dissatisfied with what I do for so long and this kind of feels like the final straw. I know the job market is bad but I don't even know what kind of job I should be looking for. Everything I've found is just another development job where I would be either fully committed to only being a programmer or a sysadmin like before. Is there anything else out there that besides management or something... I have a lot more python data experience from school but it seems data science is hard to get into if you don't have work experience, and I've never gotten a response back to any of the jobs I applied to in that field. I've done a few interviews for coding related positions, and I actually got what I thought was the ideal job last year, I turned it down though because they were requiring me to attend a meeting once a week that was a lot farther than my current position. I feel almost spoiled to be asking for a remote job right now, but I can't imagine going to an office and being productive, I'm just not a social person and I work best from my own desk and my cat with me (haha).
