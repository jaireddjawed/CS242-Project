I changed the recipe in that I had 50% ground beef and 50% ground lamb.  I used a lb of each but only increased the salt to 3tsp.  TBH, they seemed a little salty to me, but they were exactly the right consistency and overall, this was a simple recipe.  Thanks Kenji!!!",

However, I'm not 100% happy with the way the bottom and sides of the pizza come out very blackened. \n\nLiving in Metro Detroit, I've had tons of variations on Detroit-style. If you grab a pie from one of the most well-known places, like Buddy's or Loui's, the crust is never as black as using this recipe. The pizzas from these places will have a brown bottom and sometimes the sides/edges (at the top of the pizza) will be black.\n\nCan anyone suggest a way to alter the recipe so that the crust will be less blackened? Is it as simple as cooking at a lower temp or something like that?",

Is this the inner-most part of the steak, or some average temp? I used a 1.5\"-thick cut and there's like a 20F difference between inside and outside.\n\n2. Does resting it after the oven step help to even things out before the sear, or is it best to plop it straight on the cast iron? My steaks have been coming out a little rare so I think I'm undercooking it on the stove - I don't think 45sec is enough for larger cuts.",

This is so good I am kind of obsessed with it.  To me this is better than local restaurants brisket (I'm not in Texas).  However, if it is this good with an oven finish, how much better could it be with real smoke and a real smoker?  I'm thinking of getting a pellet smoker.  I figure I'll try out with a smoker finish to the sous vide and traditional all smoker cooks.  Smokers are quite expensive (including buying wood/chips/pellets depending on your smoker) and/or require a lot of skill if you don't buy automatically controlled units..  I'm all about results, not any particular process.  Anyone out there with a smoker can chime if it is worth the investment/time/potential variability in outcome vs sous vide/oven?\n\nThanks!",

I can make creamed corn, but I love the idea of a dairy free version, especially now that I can get incredibly fresh sweet corn.  Anyone have some ideas? ",

Does anyone else feel the same way?\n\nI know Kenji has said in the past that he wants to make it easier to find and showcase all the great content that is already on the site. Doing that in a structured way in Recipe Roundups is great but this might be a simple, unstructured way to try and make stuff visible.\n\nAlso, it wouldn't just have to be a single 'random' button for anything on the site. Maybe you could filter it e.g. if you just wanted a random post from 'Techniques' or a specific tag like 'Burgers'.\n\nThoughts?\n\n(Sorry if this sort of post isn't allowed here, the sidebar isn't showing on my app and the mobile site is awful for me.)",
