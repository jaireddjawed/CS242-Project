Then 100/96, 100/95, then weird ones like 77/55.  Then I told the students to come up with at least 3 division algorithms, and then plot which algorithm was the best/most efficient one for 1000/x (x &lt; 1000).  And then asked is it possible to \"predetermine\" which algorithm to use given x.\n\nThen I woke up, astonished by my sleeping brain.\n\n**Question 1**: Is it true that some algorithms are better than others for certain numbers?\n\n**Question 2**: Is this a legitimate/interesting Computer Science question?\n\n**Question 3**: IS IT possible to predetermine which algorithm to use given certain numbers?\n\nI didn't know where to post this question.

However, for some very flexible languages, some syntactic sugar might not be used often in practice. \nAre there efforts to simplify the syntax of languages based on its usage? Do language designers have a systematic approach to study how the syntax of the language is used in practice?

It's a very common pattern in computer programming competitions, and I'd love to know more about it. Can you calculate in a way that isn't O(i)?\n\nI once made a (really, really bad) \"aimbot\" in Quake which used this spiral pattern to be quick enough (as a proof of concept, I replaced the textures of all the enemies colors with all-white, then every frame I took an image of the screen, and starting in the middle I looked for a white pixel. Going through 640x480 pixels 60 times per second took too long, so I instead started in the middle and circled outward).",

My question is:\n\n**Among Windows, Linux, and OS X, which one is the best choice for computer science undergraduate?**\n\nI have done a bit of research myself, and the consensus *seems to be* that:\n&gt; * Windows alone is generally inferior to Linux and OS X in terms of learning computer science. However, it's the only choice for high-specs gaming on laptop, while it also has some useful windows-exclusive software. It is also the most generally used system (thus more common support/application).\n\n&gt; * OS X, although more expensive (Macbook), deserves the price in terms of popularity, aesthetics, customer support and \"it just works\" - a very intuitive, Unix-like system and with Unix-certified hardware, which is stable and helpful for CS starters. Plus, Macbook is the only legal way to run OS X, and it enables its users to more easily develop iOS apps. It also has better battery life (more portability for college students).\n\n&gt; * Linux, being \"free as in freedom,\" has a \"much deeper learning curve\" and can be the most fundamental OS to learn CS on, although buying a laptop that exclusively runs Linux is pretty hard, and it's less convenient than OS X because it needs a lot more of configurations/constant maintenance (better for geeks but not for starters?). \n\n&gt; * Dual-booting/getting virtual machine for Linux on Windows PC (not discussing running Linux on OS X) gives students advantages from both OS, but is not as powerful as \"genuine Linux machines\" (and can cause a variety of hardware and software issues due to compatibility), and it's still not as efficient/user-friendly as OS X.\n\n&gt; * Some other voices online do say that it doesn't matter which system the student gets at first, and that it's all a \"preference problem\" - they say that students will touch and learn about all these operating systems eventually.\n\nFor myself, I do prefer Windows for gaming purposes. To more effectively learn computer science at the same time:\n\n* Is dual-booting Windows-Linux the best choice for me?\n\n* Or is OS X/Linux so much better than Windows for students that gaming is not even a factor worthy of consideration?\n\n* What misconceptions do I have on the three operating systems?\n\n* What other reasons do I have for choosing any one of them over the other two?\n\n**Thank you all again!**\n\nEdits: reformatting research results and the questions.",

Directly inserting (INSERT INTO TABLE A SELECT * FROM TABLE B) the contents of Table A into B caused the data to be shifted to the left by 5 characters. Is there any way to handle this in SQL?\n\nI'm fairly certain that using each column in the insert would work, but it has over 200 columns and would take a few minutes to do it this way. And I got curious if it is indeed possible in SQL.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm making use of a simple hash algorithm and following the formula `h(key, tries) = (h(k) + tries.h(k)) mod table_size` where `h(k)` is some simple hash algorithm.\n\nSo while deleting `(key, value)` pairs, I need to implement a `DELETED` flag that goes into deleted table slots. This would allow me to continue searching as the `DELETED' flag indicate that I should continue my search even if a slot is empty as such. (I'm still a little hazy myself about the details, so please bear with anything that may sound obscure or incomplete)\n\nFor now, I've just decided use a macro like `#define DELETED -999` and it's working perfectly well. But what if a user wants to use the value `-999` as a key?? According my algorithm, I would ignore and continue my search. I'm not sure what value my `DELETED` flag should hold.\n\nMy question is, how are such flags implemented? What kind of value do they hold so as to not conflict with a key value that user might want to enter?\n\n",

There's more to the program but this is the part that's got me stumped. Apparently we can't simply change the L's to R's and R's to L's. \n\nThe correct output would be:\n\n* Start at B\n* L on Silver Pkwy \n* L on Red Blvd \n* L on Blue Hwy\n* R on College Ave \n* A is on the L\n\nHow is this output correct? Basically, what am I telling my program to do when it comes to changing the directions? Is there a pattern I'm not seeing?\n\nAll help would be appreciated. Thanks guys!",
