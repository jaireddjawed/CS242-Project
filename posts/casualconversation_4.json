Just thought I‚Äôd share my own thoughts on the topic question. \n\nI work with a theatre company to teach acting to children and I currently work on a seasonal schedule. The season just ended the other day and I helped the kids I teach to perform in a cabaret for their friends and families. I hadn‚Äôt ever felt such a strong sense of pride and bittersweetness in relation to my job until that day, and it really took me by surprise to get emotional seeing these kids who had come such a long way and really broken out of their shell finally performing on stage, and doing so wonderfully. Usually by this point in the season I‚Äôm just glad to get my job done and out of the way, but for the first time I found myself wishing for just one more class! It was a really sentimental experience all around.\n\nWhat about you?",

I loved to look at the catalogues, look at the clothes that people would wear, from shops that we didn't visit when I was a kid, it was like window shopping, from home! It was like looking into a window of a life that someone else lived. I looked at the furniture in catalogues of shops that we couldn't afford to buy from. I looked at homewares. I looked at games and toys at the department stores. Things I always wanted but either we couldn't afford or my parents didn't think that was necessary. (I always wanted Barbies but was never allowed to have them lol) But my favourite? The houses!  \nSo here in Australia there are these charity lotteries where you can win different prizes or items, but also the grand prizes are these beautiful luxury houses and apartments. I always dreamed of them, imagining what our lives would be like if we lived in them, in these nice leafy suburbs, filled with the nice furniture and the large sweeping spaces and walk in closets and bathrooms larger than my bedroom at home.  \nLol, I still dream of that now! Except I am older, and every now and then I do buy a ticket - the funds go to raising money for MS -  and each time I get to enjoy the thoughts and dreams of living in one of these places... instead of my dreary one bedroom flat.  \n  \nWhat's something in your life, either from childhood, or now, that you wished you could have or have in your life but never had the chance?

I‚Äôve definitely become distant with people since the pandemic, and in ways I think I‚Äôm still dealing with that transition of high school -&gt; college -&gt; real world, not being in an institution where I see the same people daily. But also I‚Äôve noticed that close friends I‚Äôve had for a while are just slowly fading out, my circle is becoming less and less, it‚Äôs becoming harder to find new people that I genuinely feel a connection to or a feeling that it‚Äôll be a friendship that lasts.

We have lots of pictures of the kids when they were young, pictures of our early marriage, and even more, we have the collected pictures from both sides of our families going back to the late 1800's. They've mostly been in boxes and in closets since we moved here and now we are making critical decisions about keeping/pitching them along with all of the other things we have accumulated. We've offered the pictures to the kids and they've taken what they want but nobody wants all of what's remaining.\n\nI'm not much in the \"need to keep everything because of the memories\" camp that my wife is. I say I still have the memories with or without the pictures. I don't think our future behavior in regards to them will change from our past behavior-that is, I think they'll go in a closet and we will forget about them. The thing that I keep coming around to is: will I feel guilty about throwing them away? What would you do and why? Is it so important to keep the picture if the memory alone brings you the joy? How do I rationalize tossing pictures of my kids as they grew up? If we keep them, then what?",

        "text": "I'm talking about real childhood, before puberty and teenage shenanigans. This was a time where most of us had absolutely no worries about anything. Everything was a new experience and it was magical feeling whenever you learned something new. You could eat junk food whenever you wanted without worrying about getting fat. You could sit around watching TV or play with your toys all day and no one could tell you shit. The hardest thing you learned in school was 1+ 9 = 18  and that tomatoes are actually fruits! Summer felt like a long time and you actually changed during it, and you would come back to school in September and everyone else would be a little different as well. You were basically living like a king/queen and were always full of dopamine.\n\nI sometimes think back to when I was a kid in the 2000s. I wish it were 2008 again. I was 7. When I went to school, I learned about hurricanes and animals and other cool easy stuff. When I came back I rode my bike to the park to play soccer with my friends. After that I'd play Pokemon Diamond on my DS and watch a movie on our DVD player with my parents. On Friday nights, my dad and I would watch hockey or cricket on cable TV (remember that). Once a week, I got permission to use our computer to play flash games and look at the Weather Network. I'd get to visit my grandparents all the time and they'd make sweets for me. I still thought girls had cooties so I didn't even care about them. I really had no worries about anything. \n\nFast forward to today. I'm 22. I'm finishing up my degree in software engineering, but I'm not even sure if I'll graduate this semester. AI 2 is a bitch and none of it makes sense. I have a job lined up but it requires me to move 100s of kilometers down South away from everything I've ever known. I'm scared as shit of what's gonna happen once I graduate and have to uproot my whole life. My friends will all live in different cities and soon we won't be able to see each other anymore. I'll also be far away from my family, and my parents are older now and less healthy so there's always that worry. My grandparents are all gone. The only positive thing to happen to my family is that I have a sister now. The DS and DVD player I used to have? Broken and gone. My current bike? Stolen so I have to take the bus to campus. Girls? Well, my last girlfriend cheated on me so yeah and I'm on a dry spell. I learn new stuff everyday but none of it excites me anymore. Oh wow, so my rental agency decided increase rent again huh. Nice üëçüèΩ\n\nYou can't possibly tell me that anything will ever be as good as it was for us when were kids. I know this might sound dramatic but it feels like life is starting to end and the next chapter is just 40 years of commuting to work so I can watch some dude on Stack Overflow do all my work for me.",

They were also workaholics with my dad being an engineer and my mom being an accountant. \n\nI was expected not to show emotion and be a working machine only useful for getting good grades at school and making money. I feel there parenting style was terrible and I wouldn't wish it on any child. They followed the parenting model of children being seen but not heard. Though I am an introvert like my parents.",

Usually about other people‚Äôs money. He knows a lot of successful people and he talks all about their wealth, how much money they make, how much their houses cost. He even shows me pictures of their huge mansions and properties. He just starts whipping out these saved photos he has of other people‚Äôs properties. It‚Äôs been happening more and more as of late. I‚Äôve been knowing him for about 4 years. He always did this, but lately he‚Äôs been (almost aggressively) dominating our conversations to what he wants to talk about (money). \n\nI‚Äôll try to change the subject and he will totally ignore what I said and keep controlling the conversation. Lately he has been going through some financial troubles, so I can understand why he‚Äôs becoming increasingly obsessed with it. He‚Äôs been talking about how he doesn‚Äôt have much money and talks about how so and so has this but he doesn‚Äôt etc. He talks about how rich his dad is and that his dad never helps him. (Then later he told me his dad is actually on a fixed income?) He talks about how good his brother has it compared to him. \n\n\nBut here is another thing: he seems to stay up really late, like into the wee hours of the morning, which means he‚Äôs also sleeping in late. He has no dependents. Not married. He‚Äôs a grown man. Nothing is stopping him from going out and getting a job. Or even two jobs. If he wants money so bad, he lacks the initiative to go out and try to get it. He used to provide music lessons which is how he earned his income, but lately something happened and he has to think of a new way to make income. I just don‚Äôt understand why if he wants money, why he doesn‚Äôt become more proactive about it instead of complaining so much and obsessing over other‚Äôs success. \n\nAlso, this guy has options, if he‚Äôs telling the truth. It‚Äôs not like he will ever go homeless or hungry. He does have a nice rental house. It‚Äôs beautiful. He shouldn‚Äôt be complaining so much because he‚Äôs got it better than a lot of people. \n\nI finally made a little comment, and I said, ‚ÄúWe always end up talking about money lol.‚Äù He got very insulted by that. \n\nHow do I help this 50 year old man?",

        "text": "I've spent countless hours listening to music in the hope that something, *anything* will grab my attention. First i listened to practically every popular artist from the 60s to the 2020s, as well as a collection of 50s jazz artists. Then i tried classical pieces and more obscure early modern compositions. No genre under the sun is unfamiliar to me. And yet nothing stays in my head, nothing leaves me amazed. \n\nIf music has any chance of keeping my iterest, it‚Äôs going to have to move beyond the same palatable but predictable notes, meters, melodies, timbres, and harmonies.",

I've only ever been on the other side where it seemed like this was the case and it was, but you can't really doubt the person because obviously they don't want to be with you anymore regardless. Obviously every relationship is its own thing so you can't really judge, but what are your general thoughts on this?",
