I posted here cos I want to here your opinion or views regarding my fianćee driving his female colleague to and from work and I cannot seem to swallow or understand the logic behind it. \n\nBackground story:\n\nMy fiancée's company just recently hired this 21 year old lady colleague and she lives 3.5 hours away from the office. Once a week she needs to go to the office to work as she is new and needed to be exposed and learn more about work. She wasn't suppose to be under my fianćee's team but since he needed pair of hands to delegate some work this lady colleague was transferred under his management. So to ensure that she comes on time as the public transportation wont permit her to be on time to work my fianćee is picking her up from the station to the office and drop her off after work. Since this lady was previously from another team and her line manager did the same thing, my fianćee did copied what the other line manager had in place. My fianćee felt like I do not want him to have help at work as he was struggling with all of the work he has but for me it isn't it that, I cannot seem to comprehend why out of the line managers petrol and personal car this lady has to be serviced to and from where un fact HR can arrange her time schedules and transportation. It is stupid. I felt stupid. I cannot swallow this work set up of theirs.\n\nSo sorry. I don't know what I am feeling at the moment. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "Dear wise, beautiful, experienced, strong women everywhere! Help a girl out.\n\nI’m wondering about emotional intimacy in y’all’s relationships, specifically with men. Do you guys feel like they know you? Do you talk about both of your inner motivations, deeper feelings, your past experiences, relationships and your own relationship on any kind of regular basis? Like at least once every 1-2 weeks? \n\nI’m starting to really get confused about whether this is not really to be expected in a relationship. Even though all my female friendships have been very fulfilling in this regard, it’s starting to seem like this just isn’t the case in romantic relationships. I would expect that this person would know you the most, and that the relationship is based on the two of you being genuinely interested in what the other is thinking and feeling regularly, and communicating about it. On top of having discussed both of your past experiences, current and future wants and desires, likes and dislikes in relationships and in general.\n\nIs this an unrealistic expectation? I don’t feel like men are interested in or really apt at this kind of communication. \n\nI met my current partner when he was dating someone else but their relationship was falling apart, and we got together after their break up. I’m incredibly in love but I don’t feel like he’s trying to get to know me on a deeper level or share with me his thoughts and feelings. He specifically said he wasn’t going to ask me about my exes, and this talk feels like it’s taboo almost, which makes me incredibly insecure, anxious and unhappy, of course about his ex. Ultimately it’s just about me being unsure and in the dark regarding what I really mean to him, how he looks at relationships in general and who he is in general. I tried to talk about it but communication about how I feel and why feels like pulling teeth. It went badly and I felt. Like he didn’t get anything.\n\nI am the kind of person that thrives on communication, openness, transparency, openness and connection, but not when the other person doesn’t seem interested or open to it. Am I just expecting too much? Are relationships usually not that much deeper than friendships? \n\nI would like to know your thoughts and experiences regarding how much and what you talk about with your partners!",

        "text": "I (30f) have a best friend (30f). Let’s call her Marg. Marg and I have been best friends since high school. She was the maid of honour at my wedding. She’s also been out as a lesbian since we were 18.\n\nMarg’s drinking has, in my opinion, gotten out of hand lately. Every time I’ve seen her over the past year it is in a situation where there is alcohol. She proceeds to drink way too much, very quickly, and becomes embarrassingly drunk to the point she can’t walk or talk. She did this at a formal women’s networking even I attended with her where she embarrassed me in front of one of my clients. \n\n\nBack in Nov 2022, my husband (32M), Marg, and I went for dinner. I had a prior work commitment so I told my husband and Marg that I would meet them at the restaurant. My husband and Marg got together for a quick drink then headed to the restaurant together. I was fine with this. Together, they proceeded to drink two bottles of wine plus a few cocktails over dinner. My husband normally doesn’t drink this much. After dinner Marg begged us to head back to her place for more drinks, but I could see she was headed for “so drunk she can’t talk” and I wanted to go home and get a good sleep. My husband went against my wishes and went with Marg. I told him to be home by midnight. I was mad, but I didn’t feel it was worth a big fight at the restaurant. I got home and went to bed, expecting my husband to come home at midnight. I woke up at 3AM and he wasn’t home. I called him and he was obliterated drunk. I told him to get in a Uber and get home. He spent all night and the next day puking.\n\nMy husband is not a big drinker and he wouldn’t have gotten so drunk if Marg hadn’t persuaded him to keep drinking. I had a big long talk with my husband about how his behaviour was inappropriate and that he’d upset me. We are fine. But I haven’t seen or talked to Marg since.\n\nAccording to our mutual friends, Marg hasn’t changed her habits and hasn’t mentioned to anyone that we haven’t spoken, which would be a red flag to our mutual friends as we normally spoke everyday. I have discussed Marg’s drinking with a mutual friend and she agrees she’s sick of Mary’s embarrassing behaviour and has attempted to avoid situations with Marg and alcohol.\n\nI miss my best friend, but we haven’t spoken for so long and she doesn’t seem phased. Her drinking also really bothers me and I don’t want to be around it, but I also don’t want to lose my best friend of 15+ years. What should I do?",

While this is definitely an advantage since our families live in a different country but I can not keep going out or having house parties which usually involve a lot of drinking every single week. We have been doing this since last 3 years. I am honestly just bored of it now. I want to go out for rock climbing or just for a brunch instead of attending these parties. I have communicated this with my husband but every single weekend some or other friend calls us for a Friday night party and then we usually end up drinking. I don’t mind the drinking part but I hate that it makes me waste my Saturdays as I am usually hungover and sleep deprived when I could be out walking on a beach or shopping or doing something. Also, since it involves a lot of drinking, either we end up staying with our friends or they end up staying at our house which means I can’t do things that I want to do even on Saturdays. Sundays are usually gone cleaning up the house or running errands and then I hate working on Mondays because I haven’t rested properly and did not do anything productive during the weekend. \nI start making plans for next weekend but then same thing repeats all over again. I am just tired of this. I have communicated this to my husband but he just doesn’t get it. He justifies it by saying it’s okay to hangout with friends once a week. We literally have the same fight every Friday night and we can’t seem to get out of this loop.",

        "text": "I have a friend named Danielle\n\nDanielle and me have been close friends for a very long time (we are both approaching 40) \n\nDanielle has not had much experience with relationships. She has had two serious boyfriends one in her early 20’s and one in her early 30’s. Both lasted around 2 years and burned her badly. \n\nLately she has started dating again now that things have calmed down post COVID. \n\nDanielle is smart and career driven (she’s a nurse) she makes a good salary and is very independent. She also seems to value my opinion a lot when it comes to men.\n\nThis is probably because I had a different experience with dating than her. I’ve had relationships, hook ups, did the single phase where I just wanted to party, I’ve been hurt, I’ve hurt others…. Etc etc. a bit of everything. I’m now engaged to be married. \n\nWe’ve recently run into recurring issues where Danielle will start talking to a guy and ask for my opinion once she feels like she’s really into them. \n\nExcept the guys she’s really into tend to have some kind of issue. Either they are recovering drug addicts or alcoholics, have multiple baby mama’s, bounce around from job to job, live on someone’s couch…always some kind of hardship. \n\nNow i understand life happens and any of these issues doesn’t make someone a bad person. Trust when I say I have male friends who have been in some of those situations. \n\nBut the reality is there is a pattern with her recurrently getting involved with wounded men who use her.  Her justifying ‘its not his fault he’s in this situation’ with whatever excuse. \n\nWhen she asks what I think I do my best to tip toe on ‘i don’t really care for x trait about him but if you like him..’ and she will always challenge me with statements like ‘well there’s no harm giving someone a chance’ or ‘he’s really trying to get it together so maybe we shouldn’t judge’ shutting down whatever i say. \n\nRecently I’ve gotten tired of her asking me what i think only to dismiss it anyways. So i started just yes’ing her to death.  Except she wasn’t happy with that and pushed me hard to ‘be honest’ with her.\n\nSo i was. And when she challenged me with ‘he could be a good guy, we don’t know him’ i went back with sure he could be, but just because he’s a good guy doesn’t mean you need to help him with all this baggage. I’m sure there’s other good guys that don’t come with these problems. I think you deserve a guy who already comes with having his stuff together not a work in progress.\n\nI never expected what came next. She exploded on me. How dare i call someone’s problems baggage, who am I to say what constitutes a good person, i must think I’m so highly to look at people sorting through their issues as so lowly. That i must think I’m so smart and that she’s so dumb. \n\nI was taken back…. and ANGRY. \n\nIt’s like she turned me into her conscience that should know better and took out the rage that is her inner struggle over mind vs heart on me! \n\nPushes me to be the rational one so she can operate off emotions free to challenge all logical thoughts of why this person may not be good for her. Why bother asking me then?! \n\nI finally told her i no longer want to discuss men she’s dating but this fight really seems to have affected our friendship. I can’t believe how quickly my close friend of years  flipped the switch on me defending these  men as potentially good and making me out to be the bad person in the situation. I’m hurt. Really hurt. \n\nI also feel like.. how long have you been harboring these feelings that i think I’m better than others and why would you be friends with me if you thought i was like that?\n\nShe eventually muttered a sorry but did not elaborate on how she doesn’t think I’m those negative things or how i have a point or how much she values our friendship. \n\nI’m starting to feel like our friendship might never be the same….",

        "text": "So I recently posted about a situation with a friend in another forum not attending my 30th birthday dinner. Her excuse was that me having men at my wedding doesn’t align with the boundaries in her marriage which I didn’t realize would be an issue. It was just weird to me considering that it’s my celebration, it’s a group of mixed friends and not everyone knows everyone which isn’t unusual. However after having thought about it, I’ve come to the conclusion that if she will not be participating in my gatherings and such due to men that I should fall back from participating in her gatherings as we have different circles and she’s set a line that basically there’s no interesting in mingling with people that are important to me. I do feel as though I have overextended myself a lot with her and it’s clearly not reciprocated and I know that I can’t expect me from others but I also don’t think there’s a need to continue doing extra. We had a conversation and she is clearly bothering by me now setting the boundary which is insane to me that I am not supposed to set them I guess. She was definitely not expecting it. \n\nAlso, I’ve come to the conclusion that it was selfish. She definitely seemed to turn it into a her thing which still didn’t make sense to me. There’s always exceptions especially when you call someone you’re closest friend. \n\nI guess I’m just venting a little but I also wonder, has anyone experienced similar situations?",

        "text": "[RANT]\n\n\nDear Doctors,\n\nSomehow you seem to have gotten the idea that this don’t know that I’m fat; I am fully aware thanks. Every one of you seems to think that if you mention it the clouds will part I will finally know and will suddenly lose a ton of weight. You actually think this is some big secret and that you are some how doing me a favor by telling me. Can you just stop? \n\nI’m a 38 year old woman, everything and everyone in the entire world has been telling me I’m fat and that’s why I deserve bad things in my life for nearly 4 decades. And it’s not like I’ve never lost weight, I have the symptoms that I’m trying to tell you about didn’t go away. In fact I have lost weight and felt them get worse. But even if we ignore that not every thing comes from weight; not migraine, not ear infections, not suicidal ideation. Losing weight has never helped with a single one of those things and it has for damn sure made a least one of them worse. I get it if I would just make an effort and lose weight, you think all my problems would go away; that I’m choosing this in your eyes. \n\nAll the cycle of losing and gaining weight has done is teach me that I am worthless and other people’s perception of me matters more than my own well-being. I would rather be fat and happy than deal with the self-loathing and suicidal ideation that pops up every time I have to change my body to be worthy of your attention and society’s approval. I get that you don’t want me to take up space in the world, and that my concerns don’t matter to you unless I’m skinny. So can we skip the patronizing bullshit where you try to tell me in a “caring way” that maybe if I lost weight I wouldn’t have health problems. \n\nMaybe you could listen when I say, ‘I lost 60 pounds and every one of my symptoms got worse’ or ‘these things are connected and I want to look for the cause not take a pill for a symptom’. I am in pain literally everyday. Take this pill and see me in 3 months so I can tell you to lose weight again isn’t working. I am just trying to get through the day, and I am telling you that something is wrong, and you won’t even let me explain what symptoms I’m having before telling me to lose weight.\n\nI compile months worth of data for you showing connections between seemingly unrelated systems of the body, demonstrating that they are connected and you tell me it’s in my head, or you cut me off and don’t let me say anything at all. I tell you this is what’s going on and you dismiss and laugh at me and then confirm that exact diagnosis a year later and tell me well it wasn’t true then but it’s true now. \n\nI am not stupid, I can feel what’s happening in my body, I know when something isn’t right. Why don’t I deserve to be listened to. You don’t call in my prescriptions for life sustaining medications without badgering and sometimes outside intervention. You tell me to take medication that makes me throw up daily because it will help me lose weight and ask me why I don’t think that’s worth it to lose weight. \n\nTell me how much weight do I need to lose for you to listen to me? How sick do I need to be? I eat what I can when I can, and yeah that sometimes leads to weight gain. But how am I supposed to balance it all? I want to eat food that I won’t throw up, that won’t cause bloating or diarrhea and that doesn’t make my brain scream from sensory issues, and  *gasp* maybe even tastes good. And I need to do it all without getting caught up in worrying if every bite I put in my mouth is going to make me more worthless because it might contribute to weight gain or even just maintain my weight. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?\n\nKindly, fuck yourselves and the horse you rode in on. \n\n- [ ]",

        "text": "I have been at an incredibly toxic job for just over a year. There were red flags early on, but they were hard to really judge because of the pandemic. My group in particular is notorious for being the worst. HR actually took me aside fairly early on and brought up negative Glass Door reviews and complaints she’s heard about my 2 bosses.\n\nA year later and I can see from my personal experience that everything she told me is true. These 2 people are incredibly immature, petty and vindictive. They’ve already bullied me, gaslighted me, and used my performance review as an opportunity to berate me and making things up that were not true. \n\nThey are such poor leaders that the staff is constantly set up in impossible situations. There would literally be no way to accomplish what they expect. \n\nThis morning things came to a head when I was reprimanded by my boss for saying I wasn’t going into the office for a meeting on a WFH day. However, the thing is…I was never invited to the meeting. I was specifically told by my other boss NOT to be involved. This ended with her telling me I am “disappointing.” \n\nI have a meeting set up with HR, but I’m worried this won’t go in my favor. I want to be clear in discussing the recurring inappropriate behavior and not sound like I am just complaining about a unique problem. But, I’m not great with conflict and have never been in a situation like this. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.",

I admit it bothers me to think that they are being ingenuine, because I thought I was a decent judge of character. Sometimes I sleep with them, sometimes I don't.

I was upset they’d initially tried to cover it up, but accepted the consequences of my behaviour and told them to have fun. \n\nWe all discussed the idea of going away again this year, I even asked about it but my friend said she was going away with friends from uni. This was a few days after I’d seen her drunkenly post on her private story about my two friends and another girl (who one of them originally complained about being annoying) booking a holiday. \n\nI kinda brushed it off, until I saw my friend booked tickets to the place specifically mentioned in the video. I casually asked and she claims she’s going with a friend I don’t know, but also screenshotted my message. It’s pretty clear she’s trying to cover up the truth. It hurts when this is a friend I’ve told things I’ve never told anyone else, and she knows how much I’ve struggled with depression, it just feels like no one wants to be friends with me anymore and they’re trying to send me over the edge. \n\nIt’s weird because I’ve managed my behaviour significantly better in the past year or so, and whilst I’m still depressed I’ve sorted out my previous issues. We usually meet up and have fun, or so I thought. I don’t have any other close friends back home, though I have a lot at Uni. Looks like it’s going to be a great summer of rotting in bed bored lmaoo. I’m genuinely not sure how I’ll survive it. I just feel worthless because I don’t want to be *that person* I’ve really tried to be a better friend and person in general. \n\nDo I play dumb and get them to admit it? Consider I may be paranoid? Distance myself? Or what? I feel like shit.",

That’s also about the year that she married my step dad. Since they married, he’s had four new cars and she’s had zero. She drives the children and grandchildren and pets all over kingdom come in a vehicle over 20 years old. She has always said she is waiting for his car to be paid off to buy her own. In over twenty years of marriage, he has never paid a car off before getting a new one.\n\nHe bought his newest, a 2023 Jetta, right before the new year. He took his car in for an oil change and came back with a different one. I’ve been mad, but I only got the full details this Saturday, and now I can’t even operate as a human being holding this much anger. \n\nHe wanted the shiny new car precisely that day, whatever it took. My mom makes sure he has great credit but he wouldn’t wait for our bank to approve a loan (1-3 business days), so he got a loan through the dealership. $45,000 on a $32,000 vehicle to be paid over 8(!!!) years (I’ve never seen an 8 year auto loan???). \n\nHe came home to my mom and told her to “fix it” for him.\n\nShe told me she’s doing everything in her power to “be okay” with this, because “maybe this is the thing to get him to stop drinking himself to death.”\n\nHe lives next door to me. I’ve seen him since she told me this. I’ve smiled at him and said hello, I love you. So much time has passed since he bought the stupid car. I don’t know what to say or how to say it. He’s been my dad since I was 6. He raised me and my siblings like we were his, and we were difficult kids. He’s only mean when he drinks. I thought he had been better since rehab in 2020 but I was apparently wrong.\n\nI can’t function. My wife and I (both 30F) make under $75,000/yr together. Our own car loans aren’t paid, but we have been talking about children and have around $10,000 saved. My mom won’t accept my help replacing the vehicle or the husband because of course she won’t. \n\nI understand this is beyond my power to fix. How do I make peace with this like an adult?

She doesn’t make a ton of money and it’s just a tough situation - not enough money, time, or energy to go around. \n\nHer oldest kid’s (12) teachers have been telling my sister the kid is depressed for a few years now but my sister says that therapy is really hard with their schedules and she can’t make it happen. I heard from her a few days ago that her youngest (9) has been showing symptoms of OCD (which I have experienced and seems to run in our family) for six months. No therapy because of schedules. I suggested a workbook they could do together, and some grounding exercises for kids, and offered to talk to my nibling, but emphasized that there is no replacement for professional help and she needs it. \n\nI’m struggling with what to do. I experienced some neglect as a kid - emotional for sure, but also stuff like not having weather-appropriate clothes  - and also medical neglect. \n\nMy sister cares about her kids but is overwhelmed, short on time, and sometimes prioritizes self-care because she feels it is necessary to take care of herself to be able to take care of kids. In theory sure, but twice weekly yoga classes when her kids aren’t getting the medical care they need?? \n\nNo relatives live near her. I plan to keep checking in with her once a week about it but don’t know what else to do. \n\nI’m also wondering at what point I would get CPS involved. I wish CPS would take my nibling to dr appointments but I assume they would make a plan for improvement and check in with my sister and basically apply pressure. Of course, it would destroy my relationship with my sister, cut me off from my niblings, and my whole family would be furious with me. \n\nWould love any words of wisdom.",

        "text": "**TL/DR:** No relationship is perfect and all relationships have their ups and downs, and various challenges that come along.  All couples have disagreements and arguments, and my current relationship is no different.  The thing is, lately I've been doubting if my relationship issues are \"normal\" or if they are a sign of fundamental incompatibility between us.  I am feeling emotionally completely worn out, but I also don't want to throw away something good, which I might never have again, and to regret it later.  I am having a hard time drawing the line between \"normal\" couple fighting and a toxic relationship that's no longer worth staying in, and I'm looking for insights from women who have been in similar situations.\n\n**The details:** I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year, we are both in our mid 30s.  We have many interests in common and our values align.  Over the time that we've been together, we have formed many nice memories together and have talked about eventually getting married and having children.  We have also had many arguments, small and big, with topics ranging from what we're having for dinner, response rate and quality of text messages (from both of us), who should plan out dates, where, when and how to go on vacation etc.  \n\nThe thing is, regardless of what triggers the argument, it almost always escalates into a very nasty direction, with mutual name calling, threats of breaking up, etc.  We make up later, but the thing is, you cannot unhear the things the other person said, even when you know that he had said them in the heat of the argument.  Over time, these things have been piling up in my brain, leading me to cast more and more doubt in the relationship and myself.  They have also been draining me out emotionally.  This situation has also been leading to me trying to bury small things that bother me in the relationship under the rug because I know that voicing them could escalate into one of those nasty fights, for which I don't have the energy.\n\nI am equally guilty of the fight escalation and I might be the first one to start the name calling.  I don't know why, but somehow he always manages to push my buttons like no one else.  I think what tends to piss me off is that he doesn't take any responsibility for his share of a given problem and blames it all on me.  For example, we had an argument today about texting.  He complained that I was not texting him enough. I explained that it was because he was not responding to my messages and barely texting me, so I figured he was very busy and I didn't want to further burden him with my messages.  He continued to ignore my explanation and my indirect complaint about his texting manners, and just proceeded to complain on and on about what a terrible girlfriend I am etc.  Another thing that pisses me off is that I feel like he has double standards, for his behavior and mine.  As another example, we were supposed to talk on the phone the other day.  The call first was postponed because he had a work call.  Then it was postponed because I got caught up in running errands.  When we started talking, he immediately complained about my not prioritizing him enough and making him wait.  I was pissed about how unfair that is, because I was fine waiting for him to be available to talk, so I don't see why he can't do the same for me and why that's even an issue.  Things escalated down their usual route from there... \n\nSome things *have* gotten better since we started dating, like him planning out dates for us instead of dumping all the work on me, him fixing things that were broken in his apartment that were bothering me, etc., which makes me wonder if maybe we could work out our communication issues too.  But then, in a recent argument he said something to the effect of \"no wonder you had been single for so long before you met me.\"  This just hit me below the belt!  Of all the cruel things that people might say to me, telling me that I (or another women) am to blame for being single probably upset me the most.  I will spare you the rant on that, but the thing is, I am not sure if I can get over hearing this from *him*.\n\nI would appreciate your honest thoughts and opinions, sorry that this is longer than I intended.",

        "text": "I’m struggling with something I haven’t felt since high school, and it’s really messing with my head. I’m (F37) just starting the process of going through an (amicable, mutual, no drama) divorce, at the same time trying to adjust to my roommate and best friend (F33) starting a new, seemingly PERFECT relationship with a guy (M24) who appears to worship her. Weirdly, the divorce is not hurting as much as feeling her pull away.\n\nMy best friend was going through a divorce when we met two summers ago, and we bonded a lot over our failing marriages. Before meeting her current boyfriend she and I had everything in common; divorce, feeling lonely, struggling with being ghosted by guys on apps, and not being sure about the future. We combatted those feelings by talking about our bad hookups and going to all the fun places we would have gone on dates, together. It was easily my closest friendship since college.\n\nThen she met this guy on Tinder, and it’s like my best friend was gone overnight. For four months, since she met him, he’s been her world. Everything we used to talk about she talks about with him. All the fun stuff we used to do together she now does with him. If I say anything about being surprised they did something we talked about doing together, she says she wants to go “again” with me. We tried to schedule a weekly girls night but then her work schedule changed so now the only weeknight she has free she spends with him. Every time she has a hard day, she invites him over or goes to his place. It’s a lot. Especially because she never has anything but praise for him. He genuinely seems to worship her too! I’m trying so hard to be happy for her, but it’s almost cruel how deliriously blissful she is, when I’m barely keeping it together. They are hard to be around. But if I plan fun stuff for her and I to do over the weekend, she invites him.\n\nI know they’re in love and it’s just shitty timing since I’m hurting so much and so lonely right now, but how do I not take it personal? Like I’m not as fun or as worth spending time with as this new guy she just met? I feel like I was just a placeholder until she found a guy who gives her everything she wants. \n\nI’ve tried to talk to her about it but then I end up feeling bad because she says this is the healthiest relationship of her life and my being jealous makes her not want to talk to me. But I’m jealous because she’s not talking to me! I wouldn’t mind hearing more about how amazing and wonderful he is (I genuinely like him) if she was excited to talk to me about him. Or anything.\n\nIf I had any other single friends to talk to this about I would, but everyone I know is married or happily coupled. Any advice for how to stop feeling like you’re just the person people want to spend time with until someone better comes along?",

It’s an entry level job, but I had so much experience because I was just comfortable at that position and wasn’t interested in moving up. Anyways, I was promoted in June 2022 and am now making $60k.\n\nMy boss manages 8 of us that are the same position and every quarter we have a touchbase without her to discuss any issues or concerns. Then one of us brings what we discussed to my boss and my boss’ boss. Obviously pay came up. I found out that the position below me, in the same department, has two new girls who started June 2022 and are making $60k. They both came in fresh from college with maybe 1 year (at most) experience. \n\nI am livid. When I was originally hired I asked for more money but was denied. I accepted the offer because it was still more than I was making at the time. There is absolutely no reason two different level positions should be making the same amount. \n\nMy boss is aware that we know. A point from our touchbase that was given to management was “salary gap between X and Y positions should be larger”. \n\nSince she’s aware we know the gap is non-existent, should I bring up this exact scenario in my review? Or should I keep it vague? I’ve never asked for more money because I’ve always been comfortable with what I was making OR I left and found a different job. But I actually like my job and the company so I want to ask for a fair raise. *Then* if I’m denied that raise I’ll look for something else. But I’m just not sure how to go about asking for that raise.",

        "text": "*Warning: this is long, and I'm sorry. There was just a lot of background to give. TL:DR at the bottom.* \n\nMy husband and I - both late 30s, married for 13 years, no kids - are both originally from the same hometown, a larger city in the American South - let's call it Lanford for the sake of this conversation. \n\nAbout a decade ago, we moved to a city in the Midwest for work, we'll call it Pawnee. At the time, we thought our residency here would last for 2-3 max, but...well, life is what happens when you're busy making other plans, I guess, and so long story short, a decade later - we're still here. We love the city, though, and have really flourished personally and professionally during our time here. \n\nFrom Pawnee, Lanford is either an 8 hour drive or flights - they have to be connecting, there's no direct service between the cities. \n\n*Now, a quick detour to explain our families:* \n\nI am an only child. My mom is 67 and my dad is nearly 78. My parents used to drive to come see us quite frequently, but my dad is really no longer able to do the drive, so they have to fly, and that's more limiting given the expense. \n\nMy husband has a considerably more complicated family tree, but basically - his parents divorced when he was very young. His dad has been remarried for decades, his mom never remarried but has been in a long-term partnership with another man for over a decade. Through his mom, he has two sisters, and through his dad's remarriage, he has a stepbrother. His assorted parents are all 66-67 years old. \n\nHis mom and her partner still live in Lanford, but they are hoping to move to Emerald City sometime this year. Emerald City is where my husband's youngest sister and her family live - it's another southern city about three hours from Lanford, and is about a five hour drive from us. \n\nHis dad and stepmom moved to Mayberry a few years ago. Mayberry is yet another southern city, but on the East Coast. Mayberry is about a 13 hour drive from us or two connecting flights. \n\nAn important note here is that when his dad and stepmom moved from Lanford to Mayberry, they took with them our only free place to stay in Lanford. My parents downsized years ago, as did his mom. So coming back to Lanford now requires us to get a hotel room on top of everything else. \n\n*Back to the dilemma:* \n\nWe had been talking for years about moving closer to family, but once the COVID pandemic hit and we didn't see anyone for over a year, that talk began to ramp up even more. But where?\n\nLanford isn't a realistic option - only my parents live there still (out of all the parents and immediate family), and for a lot of reasons too complicated to address here, we don't feel like moving back to Lanford would be a sensible choice. \n\nEmerald City is the most logical choice geographically - it's three hours from Lanford, and has nonstop daily flights to Mayberry. Plus, with my husband's sister's family already there, and my husband's mom + partner moving there soon, we'd have people in the area (and we know other people who live there, as Emerald City is a popular place for native Lanfordians to move to). \n\nBut we do not like Emerald City. The traffic is horrendous, the housing is way overpriced, and just...I don't know. Every time we go visit, we have fun when we're there but always are happy to leave and go back to Pawnee. \n\nSo, we thought about Mayberry. We're very close to his dad and stepmom, and know that living near them would be fun. My husband's stepbrother and his family live in the same state about three hours away, so it'd be nice having them around too. We also like Mayberry a lot more than Emerald City. \n\nBut moving to Mayberry puts us in the same dilemma as Pawnee, for everyone but his dad, stepmom and stepbrother. My parents would still have to make connecting flights to come get to us (or us to them), and while everyone in Emerald City could theoretically hop that nonstop flight to Mayberry (or we could go there to see them), it doesn't really feel like moving to Mayberry is going to solve for a lot of our problems.  \n\nThere's even more context here, namely how all of these cities are in deeply red Southern states. Pawnee is in a red state too, but closer to blue states and being in the Midwest versus the South makes a huge difference in a lot of ways neither of us can explain, but both feel. \n\nWe want to live closer to family - we are acutely aware of our parents aging, especially my dad, and how much we're missing with our nieces and nephews by being so far away. But we also want to live somewhere that we like. So what to do? \n\nThis is so stupidly long that I'm ending it here, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments if you have them. Would love to hear from anyone who has made a move to be closer to family even if the area wasn't ideal and how that turned out. \n\n**TL;DR - We live far from all of our family, and want to move closer. But the city that makes the most sense to move to is one that we don't really like. So we're just torn on what to do.**",
