That's why I wanted to share a solution that has been a lifesaver for me: Liapko applicators.\n\nThese applicators come in different sizes and needle distances and are commonly used in Ukraine. They might look intimidating, but they won't cause any harm. All you need to do is apply them to your forehead and press them in. Within an hour, your headache should be gone.\n\nI know firsthand how effective they can be, and I wanted to spread the word in case anyone else is struggling with the same issue. I haven't seen people using them in this way, came with it myself, but they have been a game-changer for me as a long-time migraine sufferer.\n\nSo, if you or someone you know is dealing with debilitating headaches, consider giving Liapko applicators a try. It might just be the solution you've been searching for.",

So, let's skip that part. I'm a 10-year insurance veteran agent here. I'm here to give you some good advice that will probably save some people a lot of money, so take it for what it's worth.\n\nSome insurance companies won't insure you if you don't currently have insurance, and some won't insure you if you have had a lapse in your insurance coverage in the past 6 months. They don't know, nor do they care about your situation as to why you didn't have insurance, even if it meant that you didn't have a car. They'll still ding you for it. \n \nThe insurance companies that *will* insure you, are probably going to end up charging you way more than you expected, and you'll get hit with some pretty bad sticker shock and not know why. You see, Insurance companies determine your eligibility to get insurance with them, and calculate the price on your car insurance policy based on many factors - three of which are: **do you currently have insurance**, **how long have you been with the current company**, and **how long you've been continuously insured with all companies**. \n\nYou might ask:\n\n\"*I've had this car insured for 10 years. I'm moving across the country. I plan on selling my car, and just buying a new one when I get settled in to my new state. Shouldn't I just cancel my policy and get a new policy on the new car?* **NO**. \n\nIf you cancel the policy, you will have lost ALL of the credit for having currently continuous coverage for the past 10 years. \n\n\"*So what should I do? It makes no sense to have a policy on a car I don't own anymore.*\" \n\nThat's why you get what's called a **\"Named Non-Owner\" Policy**. Basically, it's an insurance policy that only insures you, as an individual, for bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. It's pretty much the coverage that you'd have to have if you were going to be renting a car for a month (and then their physical damage coverage as well). You don't own the car, but you need car insurance to rent it, right? That's a Named Non-Owner Policy.\n\nA Named Non-Owner Policy would probably run you around $30/mo. or so, depending on your state. So, you'd call up your insurance company, say \"I sold my car, so I want to switch my coverage to Named Non-Owner\", and watch your premium drop significantly. If that company can't do it, switch to another company that will (Progressive, for one example), but cancel the old policy the same day you start the new one. When you do finally get a car, you just call up that Named Non-Owner company, give them the new car details, and *bam!* your car is insured and it's a helluva lot cheaper than if you had cancelled your previous policy entirely. \n\nCancelling a car insurance policy, even for a month, literally sends you back to zero, and you'll be a much higher risk for *years* to come. You'll find yourself paying higher insurance premiums (sometimes double) for at least 3-5 years, if not longer than if you had just simply switched your policy to a Named Non-Owner Policy, and then added the car to it when you got it.",

        "text": "Recently moved,  when it's dark our home is virtually invisible to neighbors and passers-by unless the big lights are on in most rooms.  We don't draw any shades or blinds. I like to stay unnoticed. \n\nI recently bought led wands.  They come with a stand for counters,  about the size of a hand held electric shaver, have ON/ OFF/ MOTION SENSE which works incredibly.  5 intensity settings from very bright to just barely visible.  Charge lasts a long time and charges quickly USB.\n\nIt's just so cool walking about the house and bathrooms without having to hit a switch on the way in or out,  and keeping the light to just a minimum keeping the house hidden (what can I say I'm a weirdo).  \n\nThey are in bedrooms,  nighttime walk ways, the kitchen and bath rooms, places I don't spend much time at.   They don't come on when it's already bright and cost about 7 bucks a piece. \n\nIt's been a real game changer for me,  hope others on here might benefit.",

        "text": "I've been going through a bit of a rough patch the last year or two. Job issues, some depression. \n\nAn acquaintance from high school mentioned on social media that his company was hiring and I reached out. The first thing he said was something along the lines of:\n\n\"I always thought you were really kind and intelligent when I knew you in high school. I think you'd do great at my company.\"\n\nThat kind act of telling me what he really thought of me back then has been a huge boost on my self-confidence. And as of late, it has needed some help.  Mostly, it meant a lot because the compliment came from an unexpected source. He didn't have anything to gain by schmoozing me or talking me up. It affected me more than I thought it would, in the best of ways. \n\nSo, my take away from that experience is:\n\nTell people around you when they're being awesome. Or if you like the person they are. Even if you're not that close. It could make a world of difference and you wouldn't even know it.",

We will have to talk it over.” 4 hours of their day was wasted as more and more senior sales people swapped out to try to close a deal. \n\nMy wife and I went into the sales pitch told the sales person that we are just here for the rate and they can’t do anything to convince us to buy in and that we had a timer running and will be leaving at the 90 minute mark. The sales person was not offended and still did their job showing us what was included and the various price points during that 90 minutes and a “closer” came in and at the end and we did the same thing letting them know we weren’t interested and we would be leaving when our timer went off. He offered a couple things, we said no, and we were out of there at exactly 90 minutes without a hassle.\n\nYou don’t need to play along to keep your rate. The sales people don’t want to waste their time either but if you give them any indication that you might close a deal they will dig in and turn up the pressure.\n\nAdditional tip: no matter what your financial situation is, act like you rarely vacation and that you are poor. They will ask you questions about your job to gauge your likely income and how much you usually spend on vacations to build their pitch against. No need to show off or be honest with a salesperson, that will only make you a mark.",

He picked a heavier looking teenage girl in front of her friends and humiliated her, as she wasn't close to 250. He felt bad, and he got a complaint about him to the management despite doing his job correctly.\n\nIn this situation where you see someone who looks heavy, weigh a smaller person in front of them or around them so they aren't alone. If it's a group of teenagers all together, then pick random people in that group to step on the scale. It's better to make yourself look like you're just taking your job seriously than to make yourself feel bad for embarrassing someone and risk dealing with a complaint. This also applies to jobs where you need to ID people. If someone looks older than they are in a group, card everyone. \n\nThis small little act can save you from dealing with angry emails or angry management. It makes you look better also and can avoid ruining someone else's day/night",
